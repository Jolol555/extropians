<p>
That enough of us deify political structures as to create<br>
effectiveness from expectation (self-fulfilling prophecy time)<br>
seems quite evident.<br>
<p>
I question, though, the terminology "neuro-semantic" in the<br>
context of these messages.  Neuro-semantic operates as a technical<br>
term in the context of general-semantics, a term that<br>
characterizes the neural centers of our evaluations, perceptions,<br>
etc..  A neuro-semantic evaluation would, it seems to me, include<br>
a self-reflexive "evaluation of the character of the evaluation"<br>
from the highly specific perspective of human neural behaviors.<br>
<p>
Leaving aside the appropriateness of such an evaluation in the<br>
context of this list for the moment, I don't see that<br>
self-reflexiveness explicitly illustrated in any of the posts to<br>
this point.  I find myself wondering if "neuro-semantic"<br>
represents a construct for later introduction, or if the NSPIC<br>
topic, as planned for presentation, has little connection with<br>
neuro-semantics.<br>
<p>
Addressing the appropriateness of the topic on various<br>
shared-interest lists, I can comment that, to the degree that<br>
"NSPIC" *does* involve neuro-semantic considerations, it may have<br>
an appropriate 'home' on a list dedicated to general semantics.<br>
(I would forward the name of an appropriate list-manager upon<br>
request in order that the appropriateness of such a discussion<br>
might receive at least a preliminary evaluation of "appropriate<br>
for the list.")<br>
<p>
Moving to such a list, though, might represent a bit of a problem<br>
for stirring up political passions.  G.s. doesn't seem to lead to<br>
passion, but rather to careful analysis of both evidence and human<br>
analytic methodologies.  The passivity of agreement with<br>
philosophical perspectives tends not to find a fertile ground in<br>
such a context.<br>
<p>
I would find it useful to have some framework, some evaluative<br>
model, presented in the context of NSPIC.  Think of the framework<br>
as a specific experimental procedure, or, if more appropriate, as<br>
a specific theory from which we might draw predictions and thus a<br>
path towards falsification.  Such a framework would, itself, stand<br>
as susceptible to criticism, both for its evaluative<br>
appropriateness and for its appropriateness in the context of this<br>
list.<br>
