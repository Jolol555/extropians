All antidepressants are not created equal.  Even all SSRIs are not<br>
created equal.  When I found the right one, I had more energy as well<br>
as a greater sense of well-being.  Adding DHEA (for me) also helped.<br>
I started taking them not because I was severely depressed, but because<br>
I felt my mind wasn't working as well as I thought it should.<br>
<p>
Not being depressed is only halfway (or less) to the goal.<br>
<p>
BTW -- I recently took a follow-up set of cognitive tests (first set taken<br>
about 8 months ago, when I'd just started on antidepressants), and it seems<br>
that on the cocktail of supplements that my doctor has prescribed, my<br>
mental functioning has improved more than can be accounted for by<br>
practice effects.<br>
