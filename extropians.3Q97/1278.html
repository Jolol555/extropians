Take a look again. Titles, international conferences, papers and<br>
claims of experimental evidence does not prove that an area is<br>
credible (I have encountered an international conference on the ether<br>
theory earlier this year). One has to look more carefully at how they<br>
argue their case: Have their experiments been replicated? Do they<br>
have a consistent theory? Do they take other possibilities into<br>
account?<br>
<p>
This is of course hard; an expert can often with a single glance tell<br>
if a field is worthless or worthwhile (unfortunately most experts<br>
just rely on single glances; sometimes they are wrong) but if you are<br>
less knowledgeable you have to look more carefully. I usually look at<br>
their terminology: if they seem to make up new words and concepts at<br>
a drop of a hat, use terminology in non-standard ways or use math for<br>
its own sake, then I get suspicious. <br>

Yes, this is true. But serious researchers do not complain a lot<br>
about this, unlike the crackpots. One of the easiest ways of<br>
detecting pseudoscience is to look for claims that the theory is<br>
being suppressed or resisted by the establishment. Real scientists<br>
don't waste the paper complaining, they try to show so good evidence<br>
and proof that the establishment will be forced to accept them. <br>
<p>
A good example is a professor here in Stockholm, who is claiming the<br>
current model of how the heart pumps the blood is quite wrong (to put<br>
it simply, the heard doesn't squeeze the blood, it "grips" the<br>
blood). Needless to say, the Lancet and the "establishment" doesn't<br>
believe him. So he has been gathering evidence, convincing other<br>
researchers and slowly been building his case despite the resistance<br>
of all the people who think he is wrong. At present his theory is<br>
becoming more and more accepted as people start to look at their data<br>
again, and sooner or later the textbooks will likely be quietly<br>
rewritten (he is also making some money from a new kind of pump he<br>
has invented, based on his heart model). A crackpot would instead<br>
have spent a lot of energy shouting about how ortodox science<br>
represses new ideas.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I despair.</i><br>
<p>
No need for that. There are plenty of people out there despairing for<br>
you. <br>
