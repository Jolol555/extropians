Yes, but these people were/are hardly Extropians, were/are they, and their<br>
"ideals" were some of the less "humane" ones in history. If, for example,<br>
Hitler would have forced 6 million Jews to go into cryonic suspension after<br>
their *natural* death, could you still call him *morally* a criminal? Is<br>
saving a person that's drowning [in a sea of ignorance and denial] a bad<br>
thing? <br>
<p>
Doesn't superior knowledge almost automatically put one in charge [or do<br>
you<br>
have to "play stupid" to save the other's ego's instead of their lives]?<br>
<p>

Easy for you to say, *you*'ve made (almost certainly) the right choice. You<br>
can be free *and* live forever. The "others" have a less glorious deal; if<br>
they<br>
stick to their beliefs (forced upon them by their peers, so they're not<br>
even free)<br>
they will surely perish. Now this may be fine in the case of  the anonymous<br>
masses, but not with friends and relatives. If they can't/won't understand<br>
the life-bringing logic behind the transhuman concept, they must be deemed<br>
mentally<br>
disturbed, and [thus] incompetend to decide for themselves (ok, ok this<br>
sounds<br>
so arrogant it will knock yer socks off, but that's the way it is). <br>
<p>
The only reason there is *not* to cryonically suspend [or otherwise save] a<br>
reluctant person, is when you *don't really care*. Period. If you think<br>
that <br>
passively killing people you like/love is better than to "limit" their<br>
"freedom"<br>
[of decay] for awhile when they're dead anyway, so they too have the chance<br>
to<br>
live a full life in a marvellous future, you should really check your<br>
values (IMHO).<br>
<p>
Most things, [including the limitation of people's freedom] are neutral in<br>
themselves, the context the're [used] in decides whether they are "good" or<br>
"bad".<br>

A RELUCTANT LOVED ONE?<br>
