I beg to differ: the copy is not you.  Unless you have some way of<br>
superimposing the copy onto the original, the copy will be in a different<br>
location than the originial.  This fact, in itself, is a fundamental<br>
difference.  <br>
<p>
For example...  say in a galaxy far, far away there is a planet that<br>
developed life exactly like ours.  On this planet, by pure coincidence,<br>
there just happens to be a human being *exactly* like you,<br>
sub-atomic-particle by sub-atomic-particle.  Is this person you?  I would<br>
say not, even though he has exactly the same structure as you.  As I<br>
mentioned in an earlier post, I think we should define a person by his<br>
*history* of structure and history of actions.  Obviously, actions should<br>
be tied to location, so two structurally-identical people performing the<br>
same actions in different locations are not the same person.<br>
