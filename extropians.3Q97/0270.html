I have read a fair amount of R.A.W. and have also met him in a number of<br>
contexts including some discussion groups. I enjoy his writings much<br>
more than I enjoy his person. As a writer he is indeed a satirist who<br>
especially likes to poke fun at pomposity of all kinds, particularly in<br>
politics, the occult and in overblown establishment science. I would<br>
select 'Prometheus Rising' as probably his most informative work in<br>
terms of what interests me the most (typologies of consciousness). As<br>
far as Extropian kinds of issues, I think R.A.W. is of very limited<br>
interest. IMHO I think he is more intersted in pointing out absurdity<br>
than in promulgating rational thought. But he is fun to read!<br>
