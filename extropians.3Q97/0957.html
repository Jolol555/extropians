Several of my job interviews included a brief test or homework problem<br>
used to evaluate my compentency and turn of mind. I'll give you an<br>
example (a real one).<br>
<p>
When being intervied by Tymshare, for a programming postion:<br>
<p>
	Given a 32 bit word, identify the position of the most significant<br>
	'1' bit. Maximize speed, minimize resources used.<br>
<p>
	Note: This problem has an obvious solution, which is too slow. There<br>
	is another obvious solution, which takes WAAAAY too much memory. (This<br>
	note was not provided as part of the test, but as a hint to those of<br>
	you who might want to solve this little puzzle. I'd be happy to analyse<br>
	any answers.)<br>
<p>
Point is, most educational credentials are so much whoo whaaah.<br>
