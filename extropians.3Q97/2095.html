I'd like to claim that I've done a rigorous analysis of this, but<br>
the truth is that the idea came from "Dragon's Egg", by Robert L.<br>
Forward. It's a neat science fiction book about life on the<br>
surface of a neutron star.<br>
<p>
The question, of course, is whether<br>
or not neutronium can exist in the form of collapsed atoms.<br>
If so, some sort of chemistry should be possible, and therefore<br>
nonotech may be possible.  Otherwise, neutronium may end up<br>
being either a "neutron soup" or a "neutron crystal." If<br>
"soup", there may not be enough structure to support<br>
computation. If "crystal" there may be enough structure,<br>
but a completely new technical approach may be required.<br>
If an atomic phase is possible at some pressure, but the<br>
"soup" phase arises at a higher pressure, the engineering<br>
will be very interesting. We'll need to maximize the computing<br>
capacity by finding the appropriate configuration of matter to<br>
mazimize the atomic-neutronium regime. This may require new<br>
physics. Of course, the instant you start depending on new<br>
physics the entire speculation becomes unconstrained.<br>
