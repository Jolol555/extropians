<i>&gt;&gt; I thought your claim was "For extending the human life </i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; new DNA. </i><br>
Joa Pedro replied:<br>
<i>&gt;No, rewriting the DNA doesn't mean writing a whole new DNA, it means</i><br>
<i>&gt;correcting the existing errors. If one writes a completely new DNA the</i><br>
<i>&gt;consequences can be disastrous.</i><br>
<p>
I wrote:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; We're both assuming the cell will have to be repaired continuously. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Only you're counting on designing new biological machines </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to do the repairing, using the programming language of the DNA.</i><br>
Joa Pedro replied:<br>
<i>&gt;Not exactly, my idea is not repair but to prevent damage, by correcting</i><br>
<i>&gt;the errors you prevent the damage in the first place and you won't need</i><br>
<i>&gt;to repair anything (well, .probably old persons already much 'damaged'</i><br>
<i>&gt;by time and age will need to be repaired)</i><br>
<p>
It seems, you're assuming that aging is only caused by error's in <br>
the DNA. If I understand correctly you're assuming these error's <br>
are already present from the beginning (so you're not referring <br>
to the random error's created by damage to the DNA during life <br>
itself). <br>
<p>
<p>
Question : Exactly what kind of error's are you having in mind ?<br>
<p>
<p>
The "error's" present in the original DNA are not the only causes <br>
of aging. In most cases other contributions are more important :<br>
<p>
1) For part of the biochemical processes in the cell the use of <br>
free-radicals is essential. Because biochemical processes <br>
are largely determined by statistics (movements of the <br>
reagents are not controlled but are random), free-radicals <br>
can drift to places where they can do harm. <br>
<p>
2) Damage created by radiation (high energy photons or <br>
particle radiation)<br>
<p>
3) The buildup of harmful wasteproducts which are not completely<br>
removed by the processes in the cell<br>
<p>
4) Maybe I forgot a few other causes ..... ?<br>
<p>
<p>
All these result in :   <br>
	-damage to the DNA coding (possibly creating a cancer cell)<br>
	-creation of unwanted cross-bonds<br>
	-damage rendering proteins non-functional<br>
<p>
<p>
However biology is using ways to fight this damage by repair <br>
mechanisms. Proteins and other cell-parts are constantly <br>
replaced. The DNA is checked for error's which are corrected. But<br>
these processes are however not capable (by design!) of correcting <br>
all the damage. Gradually the accumulating damage is rendering <br>
the complete cell non-functional (aging of the body).<br>
<p>
Therefore (cell-) aging cannot be prevented by only "correcting" <br>
the "errors" that were present in the original DNA.<br>
<p>
Actually, till now, I was automatically assuming the immortality <br>
of each cell to be necessary for immortality of the body. But <br>
ofcourse this is not required. Non-functional cell's can be <br>
replaced by new cell's. However for extreme immortality this <br>
process will not do away with all damage, because damaged DNA <br>
will be transferred to the new cell's. After a long enough <br>
period (a thousand years?) this will result in all cell's having <br>
error's in their DNA.<br>
<p>
For example, the cells do correct error's in their DNA. They do this <br>
by comparing the opposing bases of the DNA helices. But if the damage <br>
is so extensive that a complete basepair is damaged beyond recognision, <br>
this process will not be able to correct the error. <br>
<p>
However MNT will be able to (easily) repair even this damage. <br>
It will just compare the DNA from several separate neighboring <br>
cells! There is no existing biological process which can do this. <br>
That is why I claim that to reach immortality (using only <br>
genetic code altering) the DNA has to be completely redesigned. <br>
(Because new, more extensive, repair processes are required.)<br>
<p>
(Ofcourse, nature doesn't want the DNA to be completely fault <br>
resistant, because then natural evolution would stop. This however<br>
is no problem for our human future, because artificial evolution is <br>
much faster than natural evolution.)<br>
<p>
And we haven't even discussed diseases caused by bacteria and<br>
viruses. Which can be fought enormously effectively by MNT.<br>
(Because the probes build for fighting diseases in the body can <br>
be intelligently controlled, and reprogrammed almost instantly <br>
(by broadcast...) to recognize any new virus or bacterium. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Why do I think artificial MNT cell-repair machines are easier to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; design? Because you don't have to use DNA gene programming !!</i><br>
Joa Pedro replied:<br>
<i>&gt;No but you will still have to know what to repair, there are countless</i><br>
<i>&gt;errors in our genome each of them creating it's own effect, there are</i><br>
<i>&gt;several defective proteins and you will have to know what these are in</i><br>
<i>&gt;order to repair them.</i><br>
When MNT cell-repair machines are used you don't have to alter the <br>
original DNA. The DNA only has to be checked for new error's caused <br>
by damage. Unwanted crossbonds have to be detected and removed. And<br>
non-functional proteines have to be recognized and repaired. This <br>
should render the cell completely "healthy" again.<br>
<p>
<p>
Joa Pedro replied:<br>
<i>&gt;MNT is highly dependent on microbiology to achieve</i><br>
<i>&gt;the purpose you propose.</i><br>
Actually, there are different pathways for developing MNT. Personally<br>
I guess the microbiology pathway is more complicated and therefore less<br>
likely to succeed first, I favor the STM/AFM pathway. However <br>
it also seems likely that a hybrid approach can be used.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;As a conclusion, I think MNT might also play a role in achieving life</i><br>
<i>&gt;extension, to repair the damage done to our cells, perhaps even to</i><br>
<i>&gt;change our genes (gene therapy is still not achieving great results</i><br>
<i>&gt;lately) but the ultimate way to achieve life extension is by correcting</i><br>
<i>&gt;our DNA.</i><br>
That depends on what you consider ultimate. However I still claim that <br>
you will have to redesign the complete DNA.<br>
<p>
I hope you will see that MNT is the best (only feasible) pathway <br>
to real immortality.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Ok, we have read out all genes, but that doesn't mean that we understand </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the program that is written in the genes. I can print out the bits (or </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; bytes) of a computer program. Everybody can read the ones and zero's,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; even</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; copy them. But do they understand what they are reading, do they</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; understand </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; what the program will do? NO!!!</i><br>
Joa Pedro replied:<br>
<i>&gt;Some aging and senescence related genes have been mapped and some works</i><br>
<i>&gt;(like in Aeiveos, <a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/">http://www.aeiveos.com/</a>) are trying to map the genes</i><br>
<i>&gt;that influence and originate aging.</i><br>
OK, empirical investigation will work to some extend, but actually I <br>
was referring to a complete redesign of the DNA, which I still see <br>
as the only possible way to reach immortality, when using the DNA <br>
approach ONLY. (But as I told before, I see less complicated ways <br>
to reach immortality.)<br>
