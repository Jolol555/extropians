Lifestyle... ;-)   Right:<br>
If I get myself killed in the next 25 years or so the *overriding*<br>
probability is that it will be on an mountaineering expedition (Kill-rate<br>
is about 1-5% per summit). If this is the case then the chances of my<br>
remains reach a facility in time are nil (if any remains remain, not much<br>
left to suspend when you get hit by an avalanche or make a 1000Ft drop<br>
without-parachute).<br>
I guess long-term future is not my primary concern, the next expedition is.<br>
<p>
Maybe this is hard to understand for most Extropians but in light of these<br>
facts suspension is not *my* priority.<br>
But I'm meeting with Den Otter (in the flesh, so to speak) tomorrow and I'm<br>
looking forward to talking with him and some other Transhumans/Extropians.<br>

<i> &gt;You mean it's legally impossible in the Netherlands today? </i><br>
<p>
I'n note sure, it's also a matter of availability of a site, none yet exist.<br>
Den Otter has been doing some research on the possibilities for suspension<br>
in Holland.<br>
Den, care to comment?<br>
<p>

<p>
It's not just about me, giving it to the a (carefully selected) development<br>
project in a third-world country might be, in my view, a better way of<br>
spending it. For $100.000 you can have an (very risky) shot at the revival<br>
of one person in a Holland or the US... *or* you can cure a couple of<br>
hundred people in Nepal.<br>
Might not be a bad alternative... It all depends on how various things<br>
develop.<br>
I feel that if can help save a life at little expense to myself than it is<br>
my obligation to do so (at least to a certain extent).<br>
<p>
But thanx for the concern Micheal, and I'll try to be at the Far Edge Party<br>
if I can make it ;-)<br>
