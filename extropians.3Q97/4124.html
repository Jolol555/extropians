If I have understood this risk evaluation, we learn the following bottom line:<br>
<p>
There seems to be a one in a million chance of a plutonium dispersal<br>
accident into the biosphere, which would be the direct cause of 100 to 500<br>
deaths during the next half century.  <br>
<p>
Despite the waffle about this being the same odds of a billion people dying<br>
in a dino-killer asteroid impact, we have no control over an asteroid and<br>
every control over Cassini.  <br>
<p>
A better comparison might be with deaths by batphone cranial cancers, or<br>
crossing the road.  We cannot avoid crossing the road, and will not give up<br>
the convenience of mobile phones (which might be altogether benign, in<br>
fact, and raise our IQs for all I know).  <br>
<p>
We do not, however, have any pressing need for a nuclear powered Cassini<br>
mission, except for the admirable hunger for knowledge of the scientists<br>
involved, and the interest of their supporters such as ourselves.  It is<br>
therefore their and our choice to expose up to 500 people to the risk of<br>
death by cancer (a very small risk, true, but an avoidable one).  This<br>
cannot be compared with the use of coal-fired powerplants that produce more<br>
radio-isotope dispersal than nuclear plants - although here, too, the most<br>
forceful objections have to do with the comparative risks of catastrophic<br>
one-off failures and persistent pollutants.<br>
<p>
In other words, while I personally am devoted to space programs and<br>
enthralled by their findings, I do see the rational force of the objections<br>
to Cassini, and I don't think it helps to diagnose their proponents as<br>
driven by malevolent personal motives.  The reasoned solution, as always,<br>
has to be found in a candid risk analysis - not in misleading references to<br>
dinosaur busters (which sounds to me like a shrugging appeal to the Will of<br>
Allah).<br>
