<i>&gt; OK, now I understand where things stand.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's always a pleasure to meet another "experienced gambler"</i><br>
<i>&gt; --unless you both happen to be sitting at the same table. :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe my crew chief was embellishing, maybe not--but he was there,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the fact that, e.g., supply planes or P3s come in that heavy</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not at all the same thing as operating squadrons of jets that</i><br>
<i>&gt; have similar loads. But OK, you may be right--gee, after all</i><br>
<i>&gt; that development, why wasn't the B variant fielded?</i><br>
<p>
Variants of the F-111 ranged upward to the F variants. The B was the<br>
FB-111B, i.e. the "bomber" version that was typically based exlusively<br>
at Lakenheath over in England, and was used against those baddies, the<br>
Libyans by good old Ron. The C variant was an export version bought by<br>
Australia, the D version I worked on, which had more powerful engines<br>
and shorter wings, and the E and F variants that were used in electronic<br>
warfare missions, and still are today.<br>
<p>
I can attest to the ruggedness of the D version. I personally was on the<br>
ramp when one came in with the following story:<br>
<p>
They were at around 5,000 feet and flew through a thermal that had a<br>
bunch of eagles in it. They took one down on engine, which promptly<br>
killed that engine, and sent pureed eagle through the compressor outlet<br>
to the environmental system such that it began snowing frozen eagle<br>
blood in the cockpit. Another hit the nose cone head on and shattered<br>
the composite structure, so that it (the nose cone) then hung down<br>
vertically like a flaccid John Holmes as a loose basket of fibers. A<br>
second eagle then hit the nose, which penetrated the avionics bays,<br>
happened to hit the pressure valve for the cockpit capsule dead on and<br>
broke into the cockpit, dying its last gasps on the WSO's (pronounced<br>
wizzo) lap, who was a butter bar leutenant on one of his first flights<br>
in that machine. <br>
<p>
WIth all the drag of the limp nose cone, and only one engine running,<br>
the pilot, a Col. vietnam vet, put that last engine of full afterburner<br>
to maintain speed above stall, and limped home over 400 miles.<br>
<p>
I was rather impressed to watch the thing land, with its nose dragging<br>
on the airstrip.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Because it turned out to be a bad idea. There is no intrinsic</i><br>
<i>&gt; shame in that, but there was pork in the process that led</i><br>
<i>&gt; to a "large turning radius". That was my intended point.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I know there are aerospace success stories, and I know how</i><br>
<i>&gt; they sometimes get scotched, too--see the rise and fall of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the DC-X, and NASA's lame "oh, gee, don't know where we</i><br>
<i>&gt; can scrape up money" story. There are none so blind...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By the way, the real aces up my sleeve were aircraft</i><br>
<i>&gt; such as Paraplanes *and* the fact that I said</i><br>
<i>&gt; "'til failure" of either the airframe or the powerplant.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Run an RPV into the ground and your maintenance hours</i><br>
<i>&gt; could be _zero_. :)</i><br>
<p>
Hey, thats cheating....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Darn, there goes my free Zoche. :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyway: it's down to your believing that we're such a hot</i><br>
<i>&gt; radio item that our first visitors will (/have) come in the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing they can bolt together that will make the trip. Correct?</i><br>
<p>
Or even if they've been up there a while. Look at how we still haven't<br>
gotten back to the moon, when "logic" says that we should be colonizing<br>
Mars now with more than dead bacteria on our robots. Other civilizations<br>
, odds are, would have just as much chance of backsliding, budget<br>
pinching as we have shown. We've been focusing our energies on<br>
consolidating power on this planet first. The initial moon trip was a<br>
political ploy as a gambit in that contest.<br>
<p>
Imagine the on that other planet the length of the lull after the first<br>
interstellar voyage that only finds dead rock in the next solar system<br>
over, and leaves a planetary economy in ruins. How many decades or<br>
centuries do you think it will be before some engineers can con somebody<br>
into paying for another mission to a different star. All of their<br>
"conventional wisdom" will tell them that our radio signals are a<br>
natural phenomenon that they don't understand yet, yak, yak, wha, wha.<br>
"Why should we go to other stars when we can barely support the asteroid<br>
habitats whe have now?" "We need to concentrate on problems with space<br>
travel in our own system." The amount of time it will take to<br>
consolidate power in a space the size of a solar system is a bit of a<br>
chore. In this respect, I would guess that any advanced travelers would<br>
be descended from free enterprisers that wouldn't let a star systems<br>
bureaucracy slow them down.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Plus you believe that operating hours for space vehicles</i><br>
<i>&gt; _must_ be roughly equivalent (re: wear) to our experience</i><br>
<i>&gt; with aircraft operating near our turbulent, corrosive little</i><br>
<i>&gt; rockball under the political pressures we both acknowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; exist here in the good ol' US of A.</i><br>
<p>
High fractional C velocities in our interstellar spaces is turning out<br>
to be a pretty corrosive environment, according to data from Hubble. The<br>
concentration of hydrogen is higher, as is the dust and ice<br>
concentrations, not to mention the effect the  radiation levels of such<br>
speeds will have on materials structural abilities.<br>
<p>
Given this, the risk of vehicle failure at the far end of the rope is at<br>
its Murphy maximum.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Can't prove you're wrong, old son; but you gussy it up like it</i><br>
<i>&gt; was more than a guess. :)</i><br>
<p>
I've been thinking about this subject for quite a while, and have read<br>
far and wide on it. I think I can make some "educated" guesses.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;That we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;succeed in spite of politicians and bureaucrats says volumes about</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;engineers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Amen to that.</i><br>
