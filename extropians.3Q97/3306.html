  <br>
<p>
One. It's a tangential thought but is anyone else irritated by the phrase <br>
"a quantum jump" when it's supposed to mean a huge change,  actually it's the <br>
smallest possible change, anything smaller is no change at all.<br>
                               <br>

<i>        &gt;will be faster, smaller and more efficient than the simulation.         </i><br>

<p>
<p>
I can say it, we won't need that level of detail or anything close to it.  <br>
If tiny changes, even as tiny as a quantum jump, would turn me into a  <br>
completely new person then I die and a different person is created every time <br>
I drink a cup of coffee, that changes me a hell of a lot more than quantum <br>
uncertainty.                   <br>
<p>

<i>        &gt;Rather than an original or fake, your 'software self' would just be         </i><br>

Exactly.<br>

<p>
<i>        &gt;at the exact moment you're cloned the two of you start recieving        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;different input.  You can't occupy the same space, so you can't         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;share the same input, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Only the position of your senses is important the position of your brain is <br>
irrelevant, unless it's so far away you get a bad time lag due to the speed <br>
of light. No reason 2 brains couldn't receive exactly the same input, just <br>
put a split on the line.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;we would have to simulate that input to introduce your consciousness         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to your new software existence.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
You could but you wouldn't have to, you could get input from meatspace just  <br>
as you do now, and incidentally you and I already have a software existence, <br>
but we need new hardware.<br>
                               <br>

<p>
<p>
In these thought experiments people always look at it from the point of view <br>
of the "original", change gears and think about the "impostor" . Suppose I <br>
came to you and proved to you that Mr. YakWaxx died last week, I used my  <br>
Nano Robots to  take him apart atom by atom before he knew what hit him, they <br>
carefully recorded the position of every atom, then just 5 minutes ago my<br>
robots used this information to make a "copy" from different atoms that were <br>
handy.  Do you think Yakwaxx is really dead, is there any reason to grieve <br>
for him? What has been lost? Morally do you think you have any claim to <br>
Yakwaxx's money and possessions? Would you feel you were suffering unjustly <br>
if all your friends and family started to ignore you because you were a <br>
"stranger"? Is there any logical reason you should be more unhappy now than <br>
one minute before I told you? <br>
<p>
One last question, is there any way you can know that my little story is not <br>
true?                                              <br>
