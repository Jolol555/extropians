Lee Daniel Crocker &lt;lcrocker@calweb.com&gt;:<br>
<i> &gt;Even if that problem were solved (as is not unlikely), I would</i><br>
<i> &gt;refuse organ donation under the present government because it is</i><br>
<i> &gt;not currently legal for my heirs to receive the fair market value</i><br>
<i> &gt;of my cellular property. Better it should go to waste than be</i><br>
<i> &gt;subjected to altruism at gunpoint.</i><br>
<p>
With all due respect; I am having some serious trouble with the last sentence.<br>
maybe this is a cultural difference between our respective home-country's<br>
or just a difference between you and me.<br>
<p>
It is problably not fair that heirs don't get good cash for donated organs<br>
but IMHO it would be terribly unfair to let a person die for lack of organs<br>
when a perfectly suitable organ is rotting away in a grave somewhere.<br>
<p>
Please don't misunderstand: I'm not saying one is "better" than the other<br>
just that I'm having *real* difficulty to follow your thinking here.<br>
<p>
And where did the "gunpoint" come from (didn't we already agree to disagree<br>
on this subject - for now anyway ;-)?<br>
<p>
In another post:<br>
<i> &gt;Before making any future serious replies to the old kidney-napping</i><br>
<i> &gt;story, check out &lt;<a href="http://www.urbanlegends.com/">http://www.urbanlegends.com/</a>&gt; for a good debunking</i><br>
<i> &gt;of this particular UL (and many others).  This has /never happened/,</i><br>
<i> &gt;teary testimonials and an episode of Law &amp; Order notwithstanding, and</i><br>
<i> &gt;continuing to spread baseless fears and false legends helps no one.</i><br>
<p>
Next time I'll check &amp; doublecheck my info-resources, thanks.<br>
<p>
Respectfully,<br>
