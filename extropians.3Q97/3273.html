     As long as the best we can present is cryonics, I think they will<br>
     continue to slip through into oblivion (cryonics, while intellectually<br>
     appealing, lacks the necessary emotional "strength" to resist the<br>
     very powerful psychological pressures on the old and dying, both<br>
     from others and themselves). As soon as we have something that can<br>
     be shown to work at least sometimes, then people will come rushing.<br>

     Ding, ding, ding!  Anders wins the big prize.  I was having trouble <br>
     actually solidifying my position on the viability of present-day <br>
     cryonics, given its price tag.  Buying into it now is about as much of <br>
     a deal as buying real estate on Mars.  I don't know if I'd like the <br>
     climate but hey, that deep red goes with EVERYTHING! &lt;G&gt;<br>
     <br>
     And besides, I'm still one of those humans who still is not convinced <br>
     that we are our bodies.  <br>
