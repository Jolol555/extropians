<i>&gt; Alexander Cockburn and Noam Chomsky vs. JFK: A Study in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Misinformation</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; INTRODUCTION</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; In early 1992, after the release of Oliver Stone's film JFK</i><br>
<i>&gt; a media thundercloud erupted.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; After early attacks in mainstream media like the Chicago</i><br>
<i>&gt; Tribune and Washington Post, many other alternative media of</i><br>
<i>&gt; both the left and right began to run articles on the film</i><br>
<i>&gt; including outlets like "The Village Voice", for which</i><br>
<i>&gt; Alexander Cockburn used to write. To the surprise of many,</i><br>
<i>&gt; when some of these supposed leftist media organs did chime</i><br>
<i>&gt; in, they savaged the film as wildly as the mainstream press</i><br>
<i>&gt; did. These outlets were, specifically, The Progressive, Z</i><br>
<i>&gt; magazine, and The Nation. The writers were, respectively,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the late Erwin Knoll, Noam Chomsky, and Alexander Cockburn.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Chomsky then wrote a book, Rethinking Camelot to</i><br>
<i>&gt; specifically attack one of the main theses of JFK, namely</i><br>
<i>&gt; that Kennedy had intended to withdraw from Vietnam by 1965.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; But of the three, by far the most bitter and vicious</i><br>
<i>&gt; polemics about the film were by Cockburn in three pieces in</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Nation dated January 6/13, March 9, and May 18, 1992.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The first piece was entitled "J.F.K. and JFK" in which he</i><br>
<i>&gt; attacked not only the film, but the publishers of the book</i><br>
<i>&gt; by Jim Garrison on which it was based, author Peter Dale</i><br>
<i>&gt; Scott_who originated the Kennedy withdrawal thesis_and John</i><br>
<i>&gt; Kennedy himself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; The next two issues cited were Cockburn's response to</i><br>
<i>&gt; several of scores of letters The Nation received in response</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the original article. Cockburns's response to the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; group of letters was less than detached and academic. He</i><br>
<i>&gt; said that Scott and author John Newman ("JFK and Vietnam"</i><br>
<i>&gt; and an advisor on the film) suffered from "fantasies" and</i><br>
<i>&gt; that Scott's letter was basically "silly" and showed</i><br>
<i>&gt; "evidence of a rather pathetic persecution mania"(P. 319).</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; But perhaps the worst performance by Cockburn was in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; last round of letters. He responded to correspondence by</i><br>
<i>&gt; Oliver Stone, John Newman and Philip Green. He accused Stone</i><br>
<i>&gt; of being a fascist (p. 678), said Newman's letter was a</i><br>
<i>&gt; "confession of defeat" and called him "a very bad historian"</i><br>
<i>&gt; (p. 678)_even though in the earlier issue he had called his</i><br>
<i>&gt; tome "a serious book" (January 6/13 p. 7). He called Green's</i><br>
<i>&gt; letter "the silliest of the lot" and full of "self-regarding</i><br>
<i>&gt; blather" (p. 678). He concluded by accusing Garrisonand his</i><br>
<i>&gt; publisher, and Stone and his producer, of being in it for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the money. Not satisfied, he even stated that his colleague</i><br>
<i>&gt; at The Nation, Chris Hitchens, of liking the film solely</i><br>
<i>&gt; because he wanted to sell a script to Stone (p. 320). We</i><br>
<i>&gt; should also add here that he characterized the Warren</i><br>
<i>&gt; Commission critics as mostly "conspiracy mongers" who were</i><br>
<i>&gt; either "imbeciles or mountebanks" and that the Warren</i><br>
<i>&gt; Commission members and staff came to conclusions "more</i><br>
<i>&gt; plausible and soundly based than is commonly supposed."</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cockburn's trust of the Warren Commission was exhibited when</i><br>
<i>&gt; he gave assistant counsel Wesley Liebeler a nearly three</i><br>
<i>&gt; page interview in the March issue to defend the Commission's</i><br>
<i>&gt; main conclusions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Since Cockburn and Chomsky are good friends and colleagues,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is fair to say they communicated and compared notes</i><br>
<i>&gt; during the many months the controversy raged. Now Cockburn</i><br>
<i>&gt; has reprinted edited versions of some of his pieces plus</i><br>
<i>&gt; another separate piece on Oswald in his new book "The Golden</i><br>
<i>&gt; Age is in Us." These two hold an exalted status on the left</i><br>
<i>&gt; and many progressives implicitly trust them even though</i><br>
<i>&gt; neither has done any specific, extended work on the issues</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the Kennedy assassination, Kennedy's intent to withdraw</i><br>
<i>&gt; from Vietnam, the Garrison investigation, or the Kennedy</i><br>
<i>&gt; presidency. We feel that its time to question that status in</i><br>
<i>&gt; regard to the past writings, and the emerging record, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; then let the reader decide who is closer to the truth: the</i><br>
<i>&gt; film or its debunkers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Point #1 The Kennedy Presidency</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; =46rom The Nation 3/9/92, p. 318</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cockburn:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; ". . .JFK always acted within the terms of those [economic,</i><br>
<i>&gt; military, intelligence] institutions and that against the</i><br>
<i>&gt; script's assertions, there is no evidence to the contrary."</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Record:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; In 1962, Kennedy brokered an agreement between the major</i><br>
<i>&gt; steel corporations, including U.S. Steel, and their labor</i><br>
<i>&gt; unions. The unions would hold off on a wage increase if the</i><br>
<i>&gt; steel companies would not raise prices, which Kennedy felt</i><br>
<i>&gt; would cause an inflationary spiral in the economy. On April</i><br>
<i>&gt; 10th, four days after U.S. Steel signed the agreement, Roger</i><br>
<i>&gt; Blough, chairman of the board, handed Kennedy a memo saying</i><br>
<i>&gt; that U.S. Steel was going to break the agreement and raise</i><br>
<i>&gt; prices. Within 24 hours Kennedy launched investigations by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the FTC and Justice Department into collusion and price</i><br>
<i>&gt; rigging by the steel companies. He threatened to break</i><br>
<i>&gt; Pentagon contracts with U.S. Steel. In a week, Attorney</i><br>
<i>&gt; General Robert Kennedy began a grand jury probe and</i><br>
<i>&gt; announced subpoenas for documents held by U.S. Steel.</i><br>
<i>&gt; President Kennedy then announced a press conference and</i><br>
<i>&gt; delivered the following remarks:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; ". . .the American people will find it hard , as I do, to</i><br>
<i>&gt; accept a situation in which a tiny handful of steel</i><br>
<i>&gt; executives whose pursuit of private power and profit exceeds</i><br>
<i>&gt; their sense of public responsibility can show such utter</i><br>
<i>&gt; contempt for the interests of 185 million Americans. "</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; In less than ten days the steel companies capitulated. Later</i><br>
<i>&gt; on, when prices were raised in 1963, Bobby Kennedy</i><br>
<i>&gt; instituted a lawsuit against the steel companies.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; These actions followed Kennedy's criminal probe of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; electric companies in 1961 in which he actually jailed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; companies' executives for price fixing. It parallels his</i><br>
<i>&gt; probe of the Rockefeller-controlled Freeport Sulphur, Hannah</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mining and other mineral companies in 1962 and 1963 who had</i><br>
<i>&gt; overly lucrative deals stockpiling armament materiel at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; public's expense. In other areas Kennedy opposed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Pentagon with his nuclear test ban treaty (the CIA and Joint</i><br>
<i>&gt; Chiefs worked against him in Congressional hearings).</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; He opposed the same groups at the Bay of Pigs when he</i><br>
<i>&gt; refused to launch an invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis</i><br>
<i>&gt; where he refused to launch air strikes against the missile</i><br>
<i>&gt; silos. This last, according to one commentator, sealed his</i><br>
<i>&gt; fate with Wall Street since by calling off an invasion he</i><br>
<i>&gt; removed the last possibility of reversing Castro's</i><br>
<i>&gt; nationalization of American industries.</i><br>

<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Record:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; In 1966, 3 years after the coup, columnist Georgie Anne</i><br>
<i>&gt; Geyer, who enjoyed access to the intelligence community,</i><br>
<i>&gt; reported that "top sources within the Kennedy</i><br>
<i>&gt; administration" had told her that Kennedy authorized the</i><br>
<i>&gt; coup after a majority of the Latin American experts he</i><br>
<i>&gt; consulted recommended it. But some of the purported</i><br>
<i>&gt; participants not only denied Kennedy's giving any green</i><br>
<i>&gt; light, they insisted the meeting never took place. Some of</i><br>
<i>&gt; them believed an Arevalo government was Kennedy's preferred</i><br>
<i>&gt; option to avoid greater unrest and prevent guerrilla war</i><br>
<i>&gt; from spreading.</i><br>

<i>&gt; Cockburn:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; "At the very moment bullets brought JFK's life to its</i><br>
<i>&gt; conclusion in Dallas, a CIA officer operating firmly within</i><br>
<i>&gt; the bounds of Kennedy's policy was handing poison to a Cuban</i><br>
<i>&gt; agent in Paris, designed to kill Castro."</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Record:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; The entire second phase of the assassination plots against</i><br>
<i>&gt; Castro_May 1962 to November 1963_was concealed from John</i><br>
<i>&gt; Kennedy; in fact, not even his Director of Central</i><br>
<i>&gt; Intelligence, John McCone, knew of it. This phase included</i><br>
<i>&gt; working with mobsters, which the Kennedys found out about by</i><br>
<i>&gt; accident, and the plot Cockburn lists above, commonly known</i><br>
<i>&gt; as AM/LASH, in which the CIA was operating alone and without</i><br>
<i>&gt; Kennedy's knowledge or permission. This was after they told</i><br>
<i>&gt; Robert that 1) They would not work with the mob again, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) They would not try to kill Castro again. The CIA itself</i><br>
<i>&gt; admitted this in a classified study dated May 23, 1967</i><br>
<i>&gt; entitled "Report on Plots to Assassinate Fidel Castro". This</i><br>
<i>&gt; was not declassified until the 90's. The pertinent pages to</i><br>
<i>&gt; this point would be pp. 68, 89.</i><br>

<i>&gt; =46rom Cockburn's interview of assistant counsel Wesley</i><br>
<i>&gt; Liebeler in</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Nation 3/9/92, p. 294</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cockburn:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; "What about the speed at which Oswald would have had to fire</i><br>
<i>&gt; his Mannlicher-Carcano? Critics of the Warren Commission say</i><br>
<i>&gt; Oswald could never have loosed off the shots in so short a</i><br>
<i>&gt; time."</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Liebeler:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; ". . . . If we assume that three shots were fired you have</i><br>
<i>&gt; the question of which shot missed. The House committee</i><br>
<i>&gt; concluded that the first shot missed. The Warren Commission</i><br>
<i>&gt; never decided on the matter. The evidence is consistent with</i><br>
<i>&gt; the proposition that the first shot missed. If so, all</i><br>
<i>&gt; Oswald had to do was fire one more shot. So in fact he would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have had from 4.8 to 5.6 seconds to fire one shot, not three</i><br>
<i>&gt; shots.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cockburn:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; "So, on that explication, he's waiting with his gun aimed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The car comes along, he shoots and misses. But there's no</i><br>
<i>&gt; time fix as to when he might have fired that shot. It wasn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the famous 4.8 to 5.6 second interval. He reloads and</i><br>
<i>&gt; then fires the shot that hits the President in the neck</i><br>
<i>&gt; between frames 210 or 225 according to the Warren</i><br>
<i>&gt; Commission. . ."</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Record:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; This exchange is startling on 2 counts:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt;      1.  Liebeler, in his desperation to give Oswald a</i><br>
<i>&gt; longer firing sequence to get off all three shots, seems to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be saying (momentarily) that only two shots were fired,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which of course, destroys the single bullet theory and</i><br>

<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt;      2.  Cockburn's statement about "no time to fix" to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; first shot reveals his unfamiliarity with the evidence as</i><br>
<i>&gt; contained in his interviewee's Warren Report. On page 98 of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the report it states that from frame 166 to frame 210 of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Zapruder film (save for one frame) Kennedy's head was hidden</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the branches of an oak tree. So, by their own math,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Oswald had 5.6 seconds to fire 3 shots with a manual bolt</i><br>
<i>&gt; action rifle which the FBI stated took 2.3 seconds to</i><br>
<i>&gt; operate (Warren Report p. 97). The 2.3 seconds does not</i><br>
<i>&gt; include time to aim the rifle, or to let the scope stop</i><br>
<i>&gt; vibrating from the recoil of a shot.</i><br>

<i>&gt; Point #5 On the Kennedy Assassination</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; =46rom The Nation 3/9/92, p. 295 of Cockburn's interview of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Liebeler</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cockburn:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; "The other thing that seems to cause people a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; problems is the 'single-bullet theory'_the first shot that</i><br>
<i>&gt; hit Kennedy and also John Connally."</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Liebeler:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; "The first shot that hit went through the top of Kennedy's</i><br>
<i>&gt; back, came through the throat to the right of his trachea,</i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't hit any bones."</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Record:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, two startling points that Cockburn left unchallenged.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt;      1.  If the first shot went through the throat at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; right of the trachea it would have smashed the cervical</i><br>
<i>&gt; vertebrae, the small chain of bones in the back of the neck.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Kennedy's are virtually intact. This is due to the lateral</i><br>
<i>&gt; angle of the sixth floor window to the limousine. This was</i><br>
<i>&gt; proven at the trial of Clay Shaw during the cross-</i><br>
<i>&gt; examination of Dr. Pierre Finck and the direct examination</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Dr. John Nichols by Garrison's assistant attorney Alvin</i><br>
<i>&gt; Oser. It was also proven at a presentation in Dallas by Dr.</i><br>
<i>&gt; David Mantik at a 30th anniversary medical panel on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; death of John Kennedy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt;      2.  But its even worse than that. If Liebeler believes</i><br>
<i>&gt; the bullet went through the top of Kennedy's back and exited</i><br>
<i>&gt; his throat, he has not read the declassified transcript of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the January 27, 1964 Executive Session of the Warren</i><br>
<i>&gt; Commission, Chief Counsel Rankin speaking:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; ". . . we have the picture of where the bullet entered in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the back, that the bullet entered below the shoulder blade</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the right of the backbone, which is below the place where</i><br>
<i>&gt; the picture shows the bullet came out in the neckband of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; shirt in front, and the bullet, according to the autopsy</i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't strike any bone at all, that particular bullet, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; go through. So that how it could turn and-" (p. 193)</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; And go upward? A quite puzzling thesis: that a bullet could</i><br>
<i>&gt; go in at a downward angle below the shoulder blade and then</i><br>
<i>&gt; reverse direction without deflecting so it could levitate</i><br>
<i>&gt; and exit at the throat. The Commission itself knew the</i><br>
<i>&gt; single-bullet theory was untenable. The thesis was so</i><br>
<i>&gt; troubling that Rankin later added, ". . .that all has to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; developed much more than we have at the present time."</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Transcript p. 193) It was "developed," that is created out</i><br>
<i>&gt; of whole cloth, by assistant counsel like Arlen Specter and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Liebeler, who Cockburn quotes as an authority.</i><br>

<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; =46rom The Nation, 5/18/92 p. 678</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cockburn:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; "In JFK, David Ferrie confesses to his involvement in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; conspiracy. No such confession was made, as is clear even</i><br>
<i>&gt; from Garrison's book. Aha, said Stone at the Town Hall</i><br>
<i>&gt; event, the confession was made to one of Garrison's</i><br>
<i>&gt; assistants. Ed Epstein, author of books on the Warren</i><br>
<i>&gt; Commission and on Garrison, called this assistant, who said</i><br>
<i>&gt; that Ferrie had done nothing of the sort and that the story</i><br>
<i>&gt; was nonsense from start to finish. So far as historical</i><br>
<i>&gt; scruple goes, Stone makes Cecil B. DeMille look like</i><br>
<i>&gt; Braudel."</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Record:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; The unnamed "assistant" in question is Louis Ivon, who at</i><br>
<i>&gt; the time was Garrison's Chief Investigator and who, as the</i><br>
<i>&gt; film shows, Ferrie took a personal liking to. When author</i><br>
<i>&gt; Jim DiEugenio read this passage of Cockburn's he phoned Ivon</i><br>
<i>&gt; about the purported Epstein contact. The conversation went</i><br>
<i>&gt; like this:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; DiEugenio:      Lou, do you remember a writer named Ed</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 Epstein?</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ivon:           Epstein, Epstein. Yeah I seem to remember him</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 from the investigation. Didn't he write a piece on Jim?</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; DiEugenio:      Yes he did. It was in "The New Yorker". Has</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 he called you recently about the film and</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 the scene where Ferrie breaks down?</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ivon:           Called me? No. Anybody who says that is full</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 of bull.</i><br>

<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; =46rom The Nation, 5/18/92, p.678</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cockburn:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Anyone who maintains. . .that Jim Garrison makes a</i><br>
<i>&gt; persuasive case for "a right-wing conspiracy" should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; confined to a lunatic asylum. Garrison was a berserk self-</i><br>
<i>&gt; publicist with a penchant for locking up journalists who</i><br>
<i>&gt; inconvenienced him. . . ."</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Record:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; If Cockburn can list a journalist that was locked up by</i><br>
<i>&gt; Garrison he must have either new or fanciful information. In</i><br>
<i>&gt; all the studies of the Garrison investigation, both pro and</i><br>
<i>&gt; con, there is not one such case listed. It is true that</i><br>
<i>&gt; Garrison did charge two journalists_Walter Sheridan of NBC</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Rick Townley of WDSU, the local NBC affiliate_but they</i><br>
<i>&gt; got their hearings shifted to a federal court and then,</i><br>
<i>&gt; mysteriously, had the charges dismissed. It would seem</i><br>
<i>&gt; relevant to ask what the charges were. Among them were</i><br>
<i>&gt; bribing, harassing, and intimidating witnesses involved in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; criminal conspiracy case of murder.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps Cockburn thinks obstruction of justice is alright as</i><br>
<i>&gt; long as you don't like the person who was murdered.</i><br>

<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cockburn:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Stone didn't have the slightest idea of how to portray him</i><br>
<i>&gt; [Oswald]."</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cockburn then goes on to paint Oswald, like the Warren</i><br>
<i>&gt; Commission, as a disturbed Marxist who after a frustrating</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience at a communist cell meeting, "goes home and</i><br>
<i>&gt; reaches for the mail order catalogue for Mannlicher-</i><br>
<i>&gt; Carcanos."</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Record:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; The problem here is that there is no indication from any</i><br>
<i>&gt; piece of documentary record, any witness, any Oswald</i><br>
<i>&gt; possession that Oswald ever attended any such meeting. In</i><br>
<i>&gt; four official investigations, hundreds of books, the amateur</i><br>
<i>&gt; sleuthing of thousands of researchers, no one has ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; written of Oswald attending any such meeting, or even</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowing a communist. On the other hand, there are many, many</i><br>
<i>&gt; documented occurrences of Oswald associating with just the</i><br>
<i>&gt; opposite types. In fact Oswald_the supposed</i><br>
<i>&gt; communist_associated with two of the most rabid right-wing</i><br>
<i>&gt; groups in the U.S. at the time: the anti-Castro Cuban exile</i><br>
<i>&gt; group in New Orleans and the White Russian emigres in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Dallas. The first group wanted to invade Cuba and do away</i><br>
<i>&gt; with Castro. The second wished to overthrow the Politburo</i><br>
<i>&gt; and bring back the Czar. Funny people for a communist to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; hanging out with.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; This has led many knowledgeable people to conclude that</i><br>
<i>&gt; Oswald was not really a communist but an agent provocateur.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In fact, two New Orleans friends of Oswald said just that,</i><br>
<i>&gt; one memorandum being in the files of the Garrison</i><br>
<i>&gt; investigation and one in an interview newly declassified</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the House Select Committee files.</i><br>

<i>&gt; reversed Kennedy's stated policy of withdrawal in NSAM 263:)</i><br>

<i>&gt; Only if one is unaware of the context in which the two</i><br>

<i>&gt; quoting the final draft of NSAM 273 and comparing it to two</i><br>
<i>&gt; previous October 2 announcements, the first by General</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maxwell Taylor and Defense Secretary Robert McNamara; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; second issued by Kennedy and how the second announcement</i><br>
<i>&gt; seemed to soften our commitment to the government of South</i><br>
<i>&gt; Vietnam. Of course when Johnson signed the final draft of</i><br>
<i>&gt; 273 Kennedy's October announcement was radically altered as</i><br>
<i>&gt; Scott shows. Newman is using the rough draft of 273_which</i><br>
<i>&gt; was not available to Scott_to prepare the reader for how it</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be changed later on November 26th by Johnson and</i><br>
<i>&gt; McGeorge Bundy. Scott is looking backward, Newman forward</i><br>
<i>&gt; and they are not comparing what Cockburn says they are since</i><br>

<i>&gt; Cockburn:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; "There is no beef either in the famous paragraph 7 of NSAM</i><br>
<i>&gt; 273, which in the fantasies of Scott and Newman. . is</i><br>
<i>&gt; crucial, . . ." He then lists the paragraph. That is it for</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cockburn's comparison of the draft version and final version</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the two memoranda.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Record:</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; The obvious question the reader would have is "What is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; final draft of 273 being compared to and why doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cockburn compare the two?" When one actually looks at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rough draft one immediately sees the answer. The draft</i><br>
<i>&gt; version specifically states, "there should be a detailed</i><br>
<i>&gt; plan for the development of additional Government of Vietnam</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources. . .". As Newman points out, this is gone in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; final version. The final version signed by Johnson on</i><br>
<i>&gt; November 26th, allowed direct U.S. covert operations against</i><br>
<i>&gt; North Vietnam. A month later Johnson and McNamara approved</i><br>
<i>&gt; intensified CIA actions against North Vietnam which, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; Theodore Draper points out in a recent review of McNamara's</i><br>
<i>&gt; book, allowed the CIA to directly support covert operations</i><br>
<i>&gt; against North Vietnam. These attacks inside territorial</i><br>
<i>&gt; waters led to the C. Turner Joy and Maddox incidents and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Gulf of Tonkin Resolution which paved the way for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; introduction of U. S. combat troops, something that Kennedy</i><br>
<i>&gt; never countenanced and had already refused to do as early as</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1961.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems superfluous to add that there were also changes in</i><br>
<i>&gt; paragraphs 8 and 9 of the final draft of NSAM 273 which,</i><br>
<i>&gt; respectively, concerned Laos and Cambodia. The first change</i><br>
<i>&gt; increased the size, penetration, and scope of CIA operations</i><br>
<i>&gt; against Laos. It, of course, led to the ten year CIA war</i><br>
<i>&gt; against the Pathet Lao, perhaps the biggest and most costly</i><br>
<i>&gt; CIA operation ever. The second change made it easier to</i><br>
<i>&gt; disregard the claims of Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; U.S. was running clandestine operations inside his country's</i><br>
<i>&gt; borders. In other words, it inched the U.S. closer to</i><br>
<i>&gt; spreading the war into Cambodia.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is not hyperbole to say that the changes from the Kennedy-</i><br>
<i>&gt; signed 263 to Johnson's 273 were a milestone on the road to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the colossal disaster in Southeast Asia eventually finalized</i><br>
<i>&gt; by Nixon and Kissinger in the 70's.</i><br>

<i>&gt; CONCLUSION</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; As the reader can see both Cockburn and Chomsky have played</i><br>
<i>&gt; loose with the record.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; They have not relied on primary documents or established</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact but have instead tried (deliberately?) to use a</i><br>
<i>&gt; campaign of smear, invective, unfounded argument, half-</i><br>
<i>&gt; truths, deception and assumptions in a seeming effort to</i><br>
<i>&gt; confound and confuse the reader. Cockburn especially seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; to have used some very questionable sources like CIA and FBI</i><br>
<i>&gt; connected journalist Edward Epstein. This questionable</i><br>
<i>&gt; practice continues in his new book ( p. 352) when he quotes</i><br>
<i>&gt; a CIA officer as saying that assassination attempts on</i><br>
<i>&gt; Castro were run directly out of the White House. He then</i><br>
<i>&gt; goes on to say that this example led to the death squads</i><br>
<i>&gt; that haunt South America today. Need one advise Cockburn and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Chomsky that the CIA never liked John Kennedy, at least</i><br>
<i>&gt; since the time when he faltered at the "Bay of Pigs" which</i><br>
<i>&gt; led to the firing of Allen Dulles, Dick Bissell, and Charles</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cabell? That Richard Helms acknowledged this dislike on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; CBS 30th anniversary special to correspondent Richard</i><br>
<i>&gt; Schlesinger? That the disinformation campaign run by the CIA</i><br>
<i>&gt; against the Kennedys goes on to this day with veteran covert</i><br>
<i>&gt; operator Ted Shackley actually telling a Kennedy researcher</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it was Bobby's idea to appoint Dulles to the Warren</i><br>
<i>&gt; Commission? Would Chomsky and Cockburn have printed that if</i><br>
<i>&gt; Shackley had told it to them? Will they print it now? Of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course, Cockburn and Chomsky can't admit the resentment of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the CIA for the Kennedys. If they did, it would open the</i><br>
<i>&gt; door to the distinct possibility that the CIA, rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt; face 13 probable years of Kennedy domination, decided to</i><br>
<i>&gt; erase the problem themselves. And when one adds in the fact,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as stated above, that Oswald was likely a CIA agent</i><br>
<i>&gt; provocateur, then that verboten word "conspiracy" comes into</i><br>
<i>&gt; play. As if the CIA was not originated and designed by</i><br>
<i>&gt; Dulles to carry out covert acts and conspiracies for his</i><br>
<i>&gt; corporate clients. In the forties and fifties, it operated</i><br>
<i>&gt; mostly abroad. In the last three decades it has operated</i><br>
<i>&gt; domestically also. It has remained unchecked to this day.</i><br>
<i>&gt; =0D</i><br>
<i>&gt; Chomsky and Cockburn want to blame the system first, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; slap the hands of the CIA. But how could corporate America</i><br>
<i>&gt; operate, at least abroad, without the CIA? Socialist</i><br>
<i>&gt; economist Victor Perlo very aptly joked that the acronym</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually stands for "Corporate Interests of America". In</i><br>
<i>&gt; their desire to denigrate "the system" Cockburn and Chomsky</i><br>
<i>&gt; do all they can to unjustifiably trash the Kennedys. In fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; their attacks would make covert operators like David</i><br>
<i>&gt; Phillips proud. Their motto seems to be as Phillips'</i><br>
<i>&gt; murderous agent in the Letelier bombing stated: "Any shit</i><br>
<i>&gt; would confuse them, the jury is so ignorant that one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; best defenses at this time is to throw more shit in and stir</i><br>
<i>&gt; it up."</i><br>

<i>&gt; It is strange how Kennedy stirs the passions of both the</i><br>
<i>&gt; extreme left and extreme right. We have tried here to shed</i><br>
<i>&gt; some light on the topic. We encourage everyone to try and</i><br>
<i>&gt; get the primary documents yourself. If you cannot, get the</i><br>
<i>&gt; next best thing: a near-objective commentator. No one is</i><br>
<i>&gt; free of bias, especially on topics as controversial as</i><br>
<i>&gt; Kennedy and his assassination. Cockburn and Chomsky seem to</i><br>
<i>&gt; say: don't trust the Kennedys but its OK to trust CIA or CIA-</i><br>
<i>&gt; related sources in this dispute. We say don't trust anybody,</i><br>
<i>&gt; do your own research and we have listed our sources here for</i><br>
<i>&gt; you to check out on your own. But the use of questionable</i><br>
<i>&gt; sources, dubious facts, and weak documentation eventually</i><br>
<i>&gt; leads to a cynicism in the reader. He feels that neither</i><br>
<i>&gt; side is telling the truth, which leads to alienation and an</i><br>
<i>&gt; eventual dropping out of the process. Today, according to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; poll cited in Kevin Phillips' book "Arrogant Capitol", only</i><br>
<i>&gt; 19% of the public believe in their government, a substantial</i><br>
<i>&gt; drop from the poll of 1960 that showed that 75% of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; public believed in government. This fact is reflected at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ballot box. Phillips' notes that the biggest drop in this</i><br>
<i>&gt; belief was in 1964, the year the Warren Commission was</i><br>
<i>&gt; issued. Obviously, when voter turnout gets low, it is easier</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the economic elites to win. They are better organized</i><br>
<i>&gt; and have more resources. Their strategy is to divide and</i><br>
<i>&gt; conquer. The pattern of their ascendancy is pretty clear</i><br>
<i>&gt; since 1968, never more obvious than in the 1994 Gingrich-</i><br>
<i>&gt; Dole blowout. It is ironic that Cockburn and Chomsky don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; recognize this phenomenon and seize on the issue of total</i><br>
<i>&gt; truth, candor, and declassification of all secret documents,</i><br>
<i>&gt; including those related to the media, so that intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt; related journalists can be exposed for what they are. But it</i><br>
<i>&gt; seems these two hate Kennedy and the legacy of Camelot more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than they love the truth.</i><br>
