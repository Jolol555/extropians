I got the following from a website devoted to home schooling...fits with my<br>
experience<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
Think for a moment about what schools really do. They classify and <br>
segregate children by age and ability, reinforce class, gender and <br>
racial prejudice, and strip from children the right to any real <br>
interaction or private life. <br>
<p>
<p>
Socialization, in this respect, becomes submitting one's will to that of <br>
the group (or person in charge). This is not the basis for healthy <br>
relationships. Home educated children, because they spend so much of <br>
their time out in the real world, generally are able to communicate well <br>
with both adults and children and to have friends of all ages. They <br>
choose to spend time with others because they enjoy their company or <br>
have a similar interest - just like adults.<br>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
<p>
<p>
Duh!  <br>
<p>
Can't allow that to happen...better raise school taxes.<br>
