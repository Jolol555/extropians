     There are only three types of people .  Makers...Takers...and Fakers.<br>
     <br>
     I forget who said that but I have not a shred of doubt that it's<br>
     true...Engineers are Makers (when they're engineering)...&lt;as are Truck<br>
     Drivers {shameless plug}&gt;...<br>
     <br>
     Who comprise the other two catagories?<br>
     <br>
     I'll leave that as an exercise for the student..(hint: parisiteical<br>
     politicians)<br>

     Are you isolating your scope to that of the modern Western world?  I <br>
     rather like Daniel Quinn's classification of "takers" and "leavers", <br>
     the classic agro-dominant vs. gathering/herding-passive cultures of <br>
     Earth.  Would a shepherd be a maker or a taker?  Perhaps this is of no <br>
     relevance to the more forward-thinking extropian mind except to point <br>
     out the need to define scope in any hard-wired classification <br>
     exercise. &lt;G&gt;<br>
