Even if you were acting upon R.A.W.'s Hagbard, you's be wrong with "Ms."<br>
What does "Ms." mean to you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For me, in personal, are not just the ideas "per se" on the list,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that principally improve myself. </i><br>
<p>
This is the extropians mailing list. There are many people on this list<br>
who espouse extropianism as a personal philosophy affecting their<br>
day-to-day existence -- I, for one. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; See what I mean: The ideas here</i><br>
<i>&gt; exposed and developped are a consequence of  the very good and</i><br>
<i>&gt; developped intelectual "cyber" companies to talk the list</i><br>
<i>&gt; provides... individually and in group. </i><br>
<p>
I personally feel that the "ideas here exposed and developed" are<br>
meritorious in and of themselves. You and I and others talk about them<br>
because they *are* good ideas. They are not good ideas merely because we<br>
talk about them. Tell me if I'm misreading you.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (It functions like a</i><br>
<i>&gt; ressonator or a chain-reaction knowledge chamber...) and the list</i><br>
<i>&gt; definition topics are in  very good agreement with this...</i><br>
<p>
If you are here for enlightened debate on "list definition topics," then<br>
so be it. My question was to those who are living what they personally<br>
consider to be an extropian lifestyle -- in the most pragmatic sense of<br>
the word. What have you done with Idea X? What extropy have you brought<br>
to your own existence with Idea Y? I hope this makes my inquiry a bit<br>
more clear. The technological breakthrough that provides a concrete<br>
stepping stone to immortality is still forthcoming. Unfortunately, I am<br>
in the wrong field to help speed it along. However, until it occurs<br>
(singularity, Dan?), extropy is still a pursuable goal -- as yet,<br>
unreachable in its entirety -- but something I want, even if in small<br>
doses.       <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (I have already entered in a disc. list - which I will not mention</i><br>
<i>&gt; the name... - which was intended to be of philosophy but was</i><br>
<i>&gt; full of religious and believers, some of them with not even</i><br>
<i>&gt; philosophical (and questionable) minds... Imagine now an atheist and</i><br>
<i>&gt; objective scientist (and masterate level teacher, so with no fear to</i><br>
<i>&gt; talk about certain subjects...hehehe) in the discussions: I felt</i><br>
<i>&gt; myself the own Hell's King ... hehehe... but very stressant...Know</i><br>
<i>&gt; you (if already don't..) that, worse than Hell of Ignorance is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; of those who "do not want to know...")</i><br>
<p>
Okay, nice, but totally, 100% unresponsive to the question I posed, and<br>
the question you responded to. IMHO, a waste of bandwidth.<br>
