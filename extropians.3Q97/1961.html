To me, the by far most interesting question in this area is what are<br>
the chances that our new global civilization will befall a similar<br>
fate.  In the past the relative isolation of civilizations mean that<br>
progress could continue even when most civilizations eventually seem<br>
to grow rotten.  But now with an integrated global civilization, we<br>
can't rely on sheer numbers - we have to make this one work.  Note<br>
that within old civilizations, if one part of the civilization fell,<br>
so did the rest of it. <br>
