On Mon, 22 Sep 1997 Damien Broderick &lt;damien@ariel.ucs.unimelb.edu.au&gt;Wrote:<br>

<i>        &gt;Most people on this list clearly detest the idea of The Man taking         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and distributing a share of the community's productivity, but is        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;there another way than an IRS to create and maintain a Guaranteed         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Income floor </i><br>
         <br>
<p>
I think Max's suggestion of the of the poor buying common stock is a very <br>
good one but that doesn't absolutely guarantee an income floor. Even if <br>
The Spike happens soon and even if you have stock in a company pioneering the <br>
new technology you could still run into trouble. The Eckert- Mauchly Computer <br>
Company was the world's first manufacturer of electronic computers. <br>
They built ENIAC in 1946, tried to commercialize it,  went broke 4 years <br>
latter and had to sell out to Sperry Rand.  The danger in Max's plan could be <br>
greatly reduced by having a diversified portfolio or a mutual fund, <br>
one winner could make up for a very large number of duds,  but still <br>
no guarantee.<br>
<p>
Another idea is voluntary charity, but again no guarantee. If nobody wants to <br>
help the poor then they won't be helped, but I don't see how the IRS could do <br>
any better. If I don't want to voluntarily contribute why would I vote for a <br>
politician who makes me, and why would a politician who want's to stay in <br>
power make enemies of the rich and powerful and friends of the poor and <br>
powerless?<br>
<p>
I wish I had a guaranteed income throughout the turmoil and uncertainty of <br>
The Spike, but it's not going to happen. The poor are just going to have to <br>
do what the rest of us do, play the odds and hope for the best.<br>
