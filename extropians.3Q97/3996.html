No-one knows... it just seems to exist because noone is powerful enough to<br>
kill it, though various people have tried; from what I remember the last<br>
time it failed because no other law enforcement agencies were prepared to<br>
take on the BATF personnel and the government weren't prepared to sack<br>
them. Of course that's just the reality... the *intention* was that they'd<br>
enforce all those gun control laws that you love so much.<br>

The Dutch government was one of the first to propose banning private use<br>
of encryption. Doesn't this worry you at all? <br>

<p>
And how much money does the Dutch government get from the EC? Ireland is<br>
also supposed to have a great economy, but as far as I'm aware that's<br>
largely due to the billions of dollars they receive from the EC every<br>
year. <br>
