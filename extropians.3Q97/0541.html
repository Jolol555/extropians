First off, let me say that I think that it is  likely that the Roswell<br>
incident is a government disinformation program to cover its own current<br>
high tech research as it is like that it was a real alien incident. The<br>
odds I'd put at 80-90% that its gov't tricks. But I still don't like the<br>
inconsistencies that debunkers continue to ignore, and rely on gov't<br>
assertions contrary to truth, and evidence of records tampering and<br>
descruction. THis tells me that someone is dirty in the gov't and there<br>
is something being hidden, and its no weather balloon.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What was that? The reports of temporal dilation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When did they make that up? Or are you thinking of DS9?</i><br>
<p>
Nope, it was a report by a soldier who claimed to be at the crash site<br>
of the full vehicle, not the Brazel ranch.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; unknown materials</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technology, and no discernable power source are all evidently beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 40's technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But pretty widespread in 40s SF. In any case, most of those claims weren't</i><br>
<i>&gt; made until the early eighties, by which time they'd moved on to 80s</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology and SF. Hal's already elaborated on this anyway.</i><br>
<p>
If its all cultural related to current scifi literature projections of<br>
technology, where are the cyber abductions? Where are the "I was<br>
uploaded by an alien" stories?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; There have been accounts by scientists who claimed to have inspected</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; materials at Wright-Patt that the metals were nanoassembled, and that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the bodies DNA had less than 10% of the amount of genetic info that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; humans have, indicating possible genetic engineering.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ah, they've moved on to 90s SF. How do they know they were 'nanoassembled'?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do they have any evidence whatsoever that they were scientists working</i><br>
<i>&gt; there, that these materials exist and that they saw them?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Or is this just more hearsay?</i><br>
<p>
The reports I've seen said that the materials, when looked at under a<br>
microscope, looked like they were made up of bazillions of microscopic<br>
welds.<br>
<p>
This would necessitate a welding machine the size of bacteria, eh?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Uh, Col. Corso, who just came out with a book, was on the recovery crew,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; supposedly,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  ^^^^^^^^^^^^</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Note, supposedly. AFAIK there's no evidence to back any of this up. More</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the point Corso apparently spent twenty years in military intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt; and has a long-standing grudge against the CIA. He's hardly someone I'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; trust as a source.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and was with the Joint Cheifs of Staff as well, so the claim</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of no first hand accounts is bogus.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By firsthand accounts I was referring to those who could actually prove</i><br>
<i>&gt; they were there; for example the folks who worked on the Air Force base.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Preferably people writing their own books or articles, rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt; reported interviews, and ideally those who said something less than fifty</i><br>
<i>&gt; years after the supposed incident occured.</i><br>
<p>
Corso was at the base at the time. This is known.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Marcel, Brazel, and the local funeral</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; director (who delivered child sized coffins) have all made first hand</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; accounts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd have to check up more on that. I've already commented on Marcel in</i><br>
<i>&gt; another message (his testimony seems to support the balloon theory),</i><br>
<i>&gt; according to contemporary news reports Brazel said that the 'flying disc'</i><br>
<i>&gt; was about four feet by six inches (three feet in another report) and</i><br>
<i>&gt; appeared to be made of tinfoil, consistent with the balloon theory. I can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; comment on the funeral director, other than to point out that an Air Force</i><br>
<i>&gt; capable of keeping such a story secret for a third of a century would have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been smart enough to build their own coffins. Amazing how they can be so</i><br>
<i>&gt; smart one moment and so stupid the next, is it not?</i><br>
<p>
You forget the bureaucratic machine. Don't have something on base?<br>
where's the right contractor? From what I've seen of Area 51, its all<br>
contractor run. From my own experience on many bases, most of the<br>
logisitics stuff is handled by civilians and contractors.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Also, the Mogul balloon theory would fit thescattered materials found at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the Brazel ranch, if the materials technology problem was not there.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Which materials technology problem? The first-hand accounts don't seem to</i><br>
<i>&gt; show any problem, and the material in the photographs, which Marcel said</i><br>
<i>&gt; *was the material he found at the ranch*, appears to be the material used</i><br>
<i>&gt; to make Mogul radar reflectors. It was also, AFAIR, quite creased and</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrinkled, contradicting the supposed 'indestructible' accounts.</i><br>
<p>
The photos released were several days later, after Gen Ramey had put the<br>
cover story in place. Considering that weather balloons were heavily<br>
used by the weather people on base, gussying up something in a day or so<br>
would be rather easy.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And again, why did supposedly 'indestructible' material break up into</i><br>
<i>&gt; little pieces when the 'disc' crashed? We have a major contradiction here.</i><br>
<p>
According to Brazel, the eve before he initially found the scattered<br>
peices (June 15th), he and his family experienced a huge explosive<br>
sound, louder in his opinion than the lightning that was common on<br>
summer evenings in that area.<br>
<p>
The idea is that some explosion occured on the craft, spewing stuff over<br>
Brazel's field, but the craft still had altitude and crashed a number of<br>
miles away, which is where the main vehicle and bodies were found.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Additionally, vets who worked on that project said that balloon</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; materials were not classified, as they were pretty basic stuff, only the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; purpose of the project was classfied. If this was so, why were the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; materials shipped on a priority flight to Wright-Patt under guard?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because, as far as I can see from the report, they didn't know it was a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mogul balloon until it was examined at Wright-Patterson, and even if they</i><br>
<i>&gt; did they wouldn't want to leave it lying around for reporters to examine</i><br>
<i>&gt; because they wanted to keep the program secret. Why pass classified</i><br>
<i>&gt; information on to the folks at Roswell rather than ship the balloon out</i><br>
<i>&gt; for examination as quickly as possible.</i><br>
<p>
But the mogul project was BASED at Roswell. If anyone knew what a Mogul<br>
balloon was, it would have been the people at Roswell field.<br>
<p>
Anyways, outside of the radio reciever, the mogul balloon was exactly<br>
like a normal weather balloon. The radar reflectors were for radar<br>
tracking of the balloon.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (And what does he mean by 'balloon materials'? The payload was the</i><br>
<i>&gt; important evidence, not the balloon itself, which AFAIK was just a</i><br>
<i>&gt; standard weather balloon).</i><br>
<p>
The payload was a string of radar reflectors and a radio receiver with a<br>
tape device. Not hush hush.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Also, the Mogul theory does not fit the first hand reports of intact,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; damaged wreckage being recovered at another site closer to Roswell, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; recovery of which by military personnell was witnessed by a number of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; people on a geological or archaeological expedition, several of whom</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have given first hand accounts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But not until more than a third of a century later, *after* the Roswell</i><br>
<i>&gt; Industry got into full swing and they could make a buck out of it. Odd</i><br>
<i>&gt; that. There are no contemporary reports of wreckage or alien bodies. Not</i><br>
<i>&gt; one. AFAIR there aren't even any first-hand accounts in the 1980 book.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
According to the story, the larger wreckage was found several days or<br>
weeks later, once the story was clamped on.<br>
