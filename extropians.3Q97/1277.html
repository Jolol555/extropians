Germ-line technology, even if available in full-blown form today, would<br>
have<br>
very little effect on the future, because human generations are long. If<br>
the<br>
technology were availaable now, the first modified humans would not be<br>
adults until about 2017. There is no benefit to MY gene progeny until<br>
my grandkids are born, starting in ten years or so with worthwhile<br>
results in the years after 2030. However, because of the very long<br>
intergeneratin time in humans, we will not have fully developed this<br>
technology by then. By the time there is any impact, we will have<br>
developed other technologies that will render the human body, and<br>
possibly humanity, obsolete. At an absolute minimum, we will have<br>
developed somatic-cell replacement and/or modification schemes. These<br>
will be useful to me personally, not just to my grandchildren.<br>
