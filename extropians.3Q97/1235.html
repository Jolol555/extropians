<i>&gt; No, that is not the question. Not many would say that </i><br>
<i>&gt; consistency guarantees existence (apart from David Lewis). The </i><br>
<i>&gt; snowman is a logically consistent notion but that does not mean that </i><br>
<i>&gt; the snowman exists.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, obviously, if something is asserted to exist by a logically true </i><br>
<i>&gt; proposition, then it exists. So the questions are (1) Is the </i><br>
<i>&gt; proposition that the Mandelbrot exists logically true? (which boils </i><br>
<i>&gt; down to whether the notion of "logical truth" in the traditional </i><br>
<i>&gt; way really makes sense), and (2) Is this kind of existence somehow </i><br>
<i>&gt; fundamentally different from the existence of objects which cannot be </i><br>
<i>&gt; claimed to exist by any logically true proposition.  </i><br>
<p>
Or as another example, with a definition of "reality" which classes the<br>
Mandelbrot set and the Virgo cluster as the same, can we reject any<br>
logically consistent but "actually" non-existent phenomena as "real"?  Must<br>
we say that alien spaceships "really" are visiting the earth today, simply<br>
because there is no logical contradiction in doing so?  Is the reality<br>
of such alien visitations any less than the reality of the Mandelbrot<br>
set?  Presumably we could create a computer simulation which would let<br>
us view the former just as we view the latter.<br>
