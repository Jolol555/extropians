Personally I loved 'V for Vendetta', at least as a work of art and<br>
political propaganda; I wasn't as impressed with the story itself. V never<br>
really had any problems to solve, he/she/it could do just about anything<br>
they wanted to. And am I the only one on the planet who thought that<br>
'Watchmen' was so-so with an ending ripped straight out of an Arthur C<br>
Clarke essay? <br>
<p>
With some reservations, I really liked the British version of 'The<br>
Adventures of Luther Arkwright'; the US printing screwed up a lot of the<br>
art and the comic suffered from an average publication rate of one issue a<br>
year so the later issues are far more impressive than the early ones. <br>

<i>&gt; left-wing. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, but left-wing in the Iain Banks sense; more like anarcho-socialists<br>
than authoritarian socialists. I think I have far more in common with them<br>
than with, say, the avowedly capitalist Tory party.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not stupid, knee-jerk lefties, mind you, (I mean, I have no</i><br>
<i>&gt; doubt that they've probably given libertarian and extropian ideas some</i><br>
<i>&gt; serious consideration) but leftists nonetheless - I'm pretty sure of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; because they come from the 2000AD stable, which was a*very* left-oriented</i><br>
<i>&gt; UK comic all through the 80s, and had a few offshoots (e.g. a comic</i><br>
<i>&gt; called 'Crisis') which were as red as they come.  So unless they've</i><br>
<i>&gt; changed an*awful* lot since then ...</i><br>
<p>
2000AD left wing? Some of the 80s stories certainly leant that way,<br>
particularly those by the authors in question, but I'd have a hard time<br>
seeing Judge Dredd as left-wing (though I suspect he'd have loved to work<br>
in Stalinist Russia...)<br>
