     <br>
     Media monopoly seems to be a global phenomena.<br>
      <br>
     The avenue of practical response seems to be:<br>
     Intelligent use of the internet - Are there any with a journalist bent <br>
     interested in compiling a factual, growing database of these kind of <br>
     events that the nation states don't want people to know about? Noam <br>
     Chomsky has been doing this for years in publishing and film making. <br>
     <br>
     The internet is the only medium not broadcast from central, it comes <br>
     from everywhere. It transcends national borders until a government <br>
     (like Singapore for example) decides it best to restrict its peoples <br>
     access to the medium. This list is an example of the propogating of <br>
     idea's and information normally not available to the serfs. <br>
     <br>
     If a global network of people willing to provide information on their <br>
     governments or corporate activities and able to back up their <br>
     reportage with evidence (PICTURES) were established; we wouldn't have <br>
     to wait for the media and it's owners to decide what news is fit to <br>
     print. As this is possible to achieve right now, we don't have anyone <br>
     else to blame but ourselves. What better way to maintain journalists <br>
     standards than by setting up a strong alternative medium? How could <br>
     any government with a preference for freedom of speech possibly <br>
     complain?<br>
     <br>
     There are already existing several organisations providing stories and <br>
     swapping videotapes around the world. <br>
     <br>
     Given the prevelance of conspiracy theories, libel hungry lawyers and <br>
     those on vendetta's some sort of scale could be introduced to indicate <br>
     the reputability of the source. Decentralisation of editorial control <br>
     is essential, however, and not at all impossible, given the right <br>
     structure to such a database.<br>
     <br>
     If such an entity already exists, can someone please tell me? It needs <br>
     better advertising to be effective anyway.<br>
     <br>
     Think about it. It just takes a little organisation and involvement.<br>
     <br>
