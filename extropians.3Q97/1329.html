Yes, wear and overgrowth may be a major problem for very long lived<br>
people. Another reason for periodic check-ups. <br>

Yes, this is too bad. But it is an exciting area. <br>

Haven't there been some rather detailled discussions of an aquatic<br>
homid species? I would guess we could borrow a lot from the seals and<br>
dolphins. <br>

True. What we might need is a function that gives the poster an<br>
impression of the mean facial expressions of people when they read<br>
his posts...<br>
