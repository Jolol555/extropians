<i>&gt;This divided the octave into 18 equal steps rather than the usual 12.</i><br>

<p>
Easley Blackwood, my harmony teacher, wrote a set of microtonal etudes using<br>
equal divisions of the scale rangin from 13 to 24.  They are interesting,<br>
although I find them mostly unsatisfying musically.  18 has some neat stuff<br>
in it, yes, but mostly it's quite discordant.  19 has the best approximation<br>
of a standard diatonic (white-note) scale.  15 and 23 are the most<br>
interesting as they contain good equal-division approximations to pentatonic<br>
scales; the blues scale for 15 and 2 Indonesian modes for 23.  Easley was<br>
trying to get a student to use 15 for rock or blues but nothing ever came of<br>
it as far as I know.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It was just as easy to program the sound generator to use these</i><br>
<i>&gt;frequencies as the standard ones, of course, and Randalls had a great</i><br>
<i>&gt;time playing with the altered scale.  We ended up using only one piece</i><br>
<i>&gt;like this. It had a lot of runs in it, since that showed off the special</i><br>
<i>&gt;charactersistics in an intriguing way.  It sounded good.</i><br>
<p>
Are you sure the divisions were equal?  That doesn't sound like 18.  If you<br>
take 12, and add 1 for each black note, you get 17, which is one of the more<br>
consonant scales.  It has great major chords.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So realize that the standard 12 tone scale isn't the only one possible.</i><br>
<p>
Well, no, but Easley did eventually come to the conclusion that 12-tone was<br>
the best for music in the classical and pop styles.<br>
