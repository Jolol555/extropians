<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Old laws. It is now legal and government is helping several companies<br>
like Orbital Sciences and Lockheed to develop launch systems that they<br>
will own and operate. NASA is paying for the R&amp;D expense. There are also<br>
a number of companies without NASA backing that are actively developing<br>
launch systems, namely Pioneer Rocketplane, Kistler Aerospace, and<br>
others, while Motorola, Teledesic, and Hughes are all actively competing<br>
in communications markets and/or development. There are companies that<br>
are sending missions to the moon, and one sending a probe to a near<br>
earth asteroid.<br>
<p>
The only real difficulties are in the paperwork you need. It takes at<br>
least 8 different permits from 6 different federal agencies to launch a<br>
rocket into anything greater than a very short ballistic hop, and<br>
Congress has passed a law that no foreign launch service can sell launch<br>
services to an American company for less than 95% of the lowest cost US<br>
launch system.<br>
<p>
What is needed further from NASA is manned exploration to do in depth<br>
surveying of asteroids, moons, and worlds for human colonization. While<br>
the fantasy of independent nations on moons and asteroids going it alone<br>
from the start is pretty, no revolution is going to happen until<br>
authoritarian earth nations start exiling people, paying their way, and<br>
then taxing the hell out of their productivity.<br>
