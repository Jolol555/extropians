     Frank Mcelligott stated (to Eliezer):<br>
     <br>
     Son, I know you just turned 18, but it is time for you to grow up. If<br>
     you used those words in most of the bars in this country, you would be<br>
     still picking up your teeth from the floor.<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight:<br>
     <br>
     I wish not to pick a fight here but this is the kind of counsel, were <br>
     I to have received it at 18 that would've really made me all the more <br>
     indignant.  There is something unconsciously patronizing about calling <br>
     someone "Son" even though the writer may have meant endearment.  And I <br>
     think as far as locales and exercising of discretion, it's rather moot <br>
     to relocate this situation to a place where people have a tendency to <br>
     behave dysfunctionally when in fact, we are contributing ideas (and <br>
     feelings) to an intellectual digest.  I think this "advice" was <br>
     reactive and you may want to look at your actual motives for posting <br>
     it.<br>

     Arjen Kamphuis then wrote:<br>
     <br>
     I would like to make a point that the holocaust was not the first, not <br>
     the last act of genocide that was perpetrated on our little planet. <br>
     Just the best organized and documented one. <br>
     <br>
     &lt;list of atrocities thru the ages&gt;<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight adds:<br>
     <br>
     I watched a documentary about women and witchcraft through the Middle <br>
     Ages up to the beginning of the Renaissance.  It is *estimated* that <br>
     some 9 million women were put to death during the European and <br>
     American witchhunts to stamp on wicca and pagan memes in favor of the <br>
     patriarchal institution of Roman Catholicism (I shant call it <br>
     Christianity if only to make the distinction).<br>
