   I have read this book and it is quite a scholarly piece, with <br>
extensive references and experimentation.  His basic premise is that of <br>
neurological darwinism.  Those primitive tribes who imbibed psilocybin <br>
from time to time, were more likely to experience novel perceptions of <br>
themselves and their environment.  As to weather any one of these new <br>
perceptions provided evolutionary advantage is irrelevant in the face of <br>
brute-force statistical iteration.  In time, those tribes who were <br>
increasing the number of ways of perceiving their environment, were more <br>
likely to stumble (even blindly) onto an evolutionary advantageous <br>
pathway.<br>
<p>
   These pathways could have have been as simple as new made-up sounds <br>
and contextual body movements.  This would have the side effect of <br>
widening their range of linguistic potentialities and in turn practical <br>
language applications.  With increase communication within their tribe, <br>
this would bring about more coherent patterns in their search for food <br>
and shelter; thereby increasing there chances for survival.<br>
<p>
   That psilocybin produces brain-change is undeniable.  That it <br>
necessarily increases ones brain capacity is arguable.  But through <br>
shear random brain change, some of those changes will be evolutionary <br>
advantageous and some of them may not.<br>
