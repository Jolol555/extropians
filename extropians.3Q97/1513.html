    Too bad Extropians never seem to question Dawkins' extreme<br>
reductionism. I have ding donged on this for years, but not lately.  So<br>
I will make my assertions again.  I present the following as a conscious<br>
hypothesis....too bad Dawkins is not self-aware enough to know his<br>
reductionism is a hypothesis....actually he may be unconsciously<br>
carrying a meme of the currently dominant scientific establishment.<br>
<p>
    Genes and memes compete primarily via the characteristics they<br>
impart to their respective biological organism and social organims (or<br>
culture).    Genes and memes change or evolve for different reasons (we<br>
think).  I think the evidence still indicates that genes mutate randomly<br>
under the action of random external factors (or do molecular biologists<br>
have more advanced ideas about this now?).  We know first hand, of<br>
course, some of the ways in which memes can mutate.  Hosts can invent<br>
new memes and try to spread them!  However, only the rich and powerful<br>
segments of a society can make a new meme operational through a whole<br>
culture (hypothesis alert! Begin testing it!).<br>
<p>
    Establishments, ruling classes, intellectual appendages of warrior<br>
classes, religious authorities, etc. can amplify and broadcast the memes<br>
that they perceive to suit their purposes which usually means memes that<br>
increase or maintain their financial and political power.  Contrary to<br>
popular Extropian thought, then, the meme's "attraction" for the host is<br>
less important than the physical resources available for propagating the<br>
new meme.<br>
<p>
    As an example, if the Rockefeller, Ford, Carnegie Foundations, etc.<br>
perceived the Extropian meme set to be in their interests Extropian<br>
memes would, by now, be on their way toward dominating Anglo-American<br>
culture.  However, alas, Extropian memes are not so perceived.  In fact,<br>
the great State Capitalist dynasties and fortunes are built in large<br>
part on State sponsored, assisted, and regulated oligopoly of natural<br>
resources.  (They didn't call the State Department Standard Oil's<br>
foreign office for nothing.)  Environmentalist memes serve this power<br>
structure by limiting new competition and holding resources off the<br>
market, ie. raising the prices of natural resources already in<br>
production.  I used to have a link to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund site<br>
so folks could prove to themselves what the "big money" propagates in<br>
the way of memes...they won't tell you "why" of course.....you need to<br>
use the scientific method for that...<br>
