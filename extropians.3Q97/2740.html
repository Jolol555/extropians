Again, just a brief followup to Mark Crosby's excellent<br>
summary.  I still suspect that Churchland's prototype<br>
activation model of explanatory understanding is going to hold<br>
up better than most of its competitors that I've seen, so I'm<br>
with you there.<br>
<p>
But I'm suspicious of most recent attempts to syncretize Eastern<br>
philosophy with Western neuroscience.  I really am specifically<br>
interested in trying to assimilate whatever "introspective paradigms"<br>
Nagarjuna and the like were using in their attempts to attain a<br>
good explanatory understanding of human psychology.  Just assimiliating<br>
them into my own Western-educated head will be quite difficult<br>
enough; I really don't trust the work of previous synthesists and<br>
generalists to make these diverse ways of attemping to perceive<br>
the activity of one's own mind commensurable with one another.<br>
Commensurability between independently developed paradigms is<br>
possible but costly, and there are no guarantees that we're doing<br>
it right.  So while my interest in the very confusing and<br>
difficult-to-decipher *primary* texts of Buddhist philosophy has<br>
been mounting, my interest in the secondary texts written by my<br>
fellow Western enthusiasts of dharma is dropping to nearly indetectable<br>
levels.<br>
