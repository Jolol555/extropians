Dear fellow Extropians,<br>
EvMick raises an interesting point that most people make, although they<br>
may not realize it. <br>
It is the problem of opinion based on superficialities. Discussing public<br>
policy on the basis of an individual's personality and/or ideosyncrasies<br>
rather than the cumulative thought processes, constraints and<br>
contingencies that go into value determinations is simplistic. <br>
This is understandable. The mass media tends to focus on personalities<br>
rather than ideas. Most of the public, therefore, tends to thoughtlessly<br>
follow that simplistic lead.<br>
I'd continue on along this stream of thought, but, at the moment, my wife<br>
is calling me to dinner.<br>
More later.<br>

Got a Question Mr. Retired Civil Servant..<br>
<p>
Quote an article on the web.<br>
<p>
A friend of mine’s cousin from Germany visited him recently. When the <br>
talk turned to politics in America, she informed him that people in <br>
Germany were utterly mystified by something. "We understand that your <br>
president is an amoral crook - but how unusual is that for a <br>
politician?" she observed. "Yet everyday our newspapers are full of <br>
stories like Clinton refusing to sell F-16 fighter jet technology to <br>
Germany while selling it to China, and all the spy deals he’s made with <br>
Beijing. So everyone in Germany is asking now: why isn’t your President <br>
Clinton being tried for treason?"<br>
<p>
<p>
I beleive you said something about "when push comes to show...etc. etc."<br>
<p>
