Sigh. So much for critical thinking. 1 point to the millennial meme,<br>
0 to basic physics. <br>
<p>
Why would the alignment of planet induce the *huge* torques needed to<br>
shift the axis of rotation? The Earth has a total rotational energy<br>
of around 2.57e29 J; shifting the angular momentum vector would<br>
require energies on this order. The Earth is nearly spherical, so<br>
where would these torques be applied? Tidal forces won't do, since<br>
they would simply rip apart the planet (and most other planets). Why<br>
haven't we noticed *a lot* of evidence for immense changes in the<br>
rotation axes and orbits of most planets (if the earth is affected,<br>
what about the asteroids, mars and all the moons)? Why don't we<br>
notice similar effects among the moons of Jupiter, which are more<br>
massive compared to their central mass and have faster periods, and<br>
hence would align quite often? Why haven't we noticed periodic mass<br>
extinctions every few thousand years instead of tens of million years<br>
apart (a pole shift would certainly cause such an extinction)?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There's lots of stuff to back</i><br>

<p>
A nice example of belief bias. There are other, more likely<br>
explanations in accord with known physics, such as fossils/stranded<br>
logs from elsewhere in the case of antarctic trees (it was quite<br>
balmy before the current ice age, I think) or mistranslations in the<br>
case of the egyptians (wouldn't the chinese have noticed it too?). <br>
<p>
That there are people who believe in pole shifts doesn't make it<br>
likely. They hypothesis contradicts a lot of known physical laws<br>
(elementary mechanics), predicts some things which are not observed<br>
(like very noticeable geological upheavals in historical times),<br>
explains away the lack of evidence in an ad hoc manner (Velikovsky<br>
was a master of this; he claimed many disasters were forgotten due to<br>
global amnesia!) and its proponents rely heavily on predictions by<br>
astrologers and seers rather than observations. <br>
<p>
It is very likely the millennium will pass with just the usual amount<br>
of disasters, plus the results of a surge of more or less unlikely<br>
doomsday predictions. I don't think this list is the right place to<br>
debate this kind of rubbish. <br>
