Regarding Stephen Thayer’s Creativity Machine, I wrote that "this<br>
two-layer approach sounds like traditional client-server architecture<br>
compared to three-tier approaches" and cited a Pat Hayes post to the<br>
Journal of Consciousness Studies Online that referred to the old<br>
Perceptron model and a critique of it by Minsky and Papert.  Hayes<br>
*also* seemed (to me) to be suggesting that three-level system<br>
architectures (in general, as opposed to just neural networks) could<br>
do things that could not be done with two levels.<br>
<p>
Anders Sandberg responded:<br>
&lt; This is a bit comparing apples and oranges; what Minsky and Papert<br>
(and likely Hayes) talk about are layered feed-forward networks where<br>
information is passed from A to B to C, while Thaler is using a<br>
recurrent net where information moves between A and B.  Recurrent<br>
networks can do more than few-layer feedforward networks, and Thalers<br>
scheme could actually be implemented in a single layer if needed<br>
(essentially you divide the connection matrix into semi-independent<br>
parts). &gt;<br>
<p>
Anders, you are correct: Hayes was specifically talking about neural<br>
nets and I confused the excerpt I cited with another Hayes essay where<br>
he talks about the more general issue of virtual machines.<br>
<p>
Perhaps I was mixing apples and oranges a bit here, but that was<br>
sort-of my point.  I was not really talking about the number of<br>
*layers in a neural network*.  Nor about the particular algorithms of<br>
any single neural-net *program*.  I was talking about the number of<br>
‘levels’ or ‘tiers’ in composite *systems* or usable applications.<br>
<p>
This is somewhat related to complaints I have about neural models of<br>
the brain where many researchers seem to be modeling the brain as a<br>
vast network of general-purpose neurons rather than a *system* of<br>
multiple, specialized components.  Instead of, as you say, "dividing<br>
the connection matrix into semi-independent parts".<br>
<p>
In the context of Thayer’s Creativity Machine, I was specifically<br>
referring to the ‘conscious’ and ‘subconscious’ *functional levels*<br>
that he was touting. I was suggesting that there would need to be more<br>
than just these two ‘levels’ to adequately reflect the functionality<br>
of the human mind.<br>
<p>

P.S. Another interesting excerpt from that Pat Hayes and Keith<br>
Sutherland exchange:<br>
<p>
KS: . . . all programming models ultimately reduce to a series of<br>
binary digits going through a Turing Machine.<br>
<p>
PH: Well, replace 'Turing Machine' with 'hardware' (a Turing machine<br>
can't do anything, its just a mathematical abstraction), and I'll<br>
agree. But this is like saying that all brains ultimately reduce to<br>
masses and masses of quarks and leptons exchanging photons: true, but<br>
not very useful. This doesnt account for how programmed machines work,<br>
how they do what they do.<br>
