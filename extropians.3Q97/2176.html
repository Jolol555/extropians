     Paul Hughes:<br>
     <br>
     You'd be suprised how many women would find many of you fellow male<br>
     extropians attractive.  I recall several women remarking how cute<br>
     Anders Sandberg was based on the presentation of his lecture - not<br>
     that Anders is already a stud anyway.  Many women today are just as<br>
     attracted to brain power as physical brawn - so don't give up hope!<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight adds:<br>
     <br>
     Assuming that all the wistful extropian brains are heterosexual...&lt;G&gt;<br>
     <br>
     I have always maintained that the computer literate and intelligent <br>
     male minds will be the "playboys" of the 21st century &lt;G&gt; (picture a <br>
     Dilbert centerfold, a la Burt Reynolds in Cosmo circa 1972).  And with <br>
     a little luck, those very clever lads will also unlock the access for <br>
     more people to have those aesthetically-pleasing physiques so <br>
     currently popular in our culture.  Of course, this could just be a <br>
     phase.  Renaissance-style "rubenesque"-ness may come back into <br>
     popularity &lt;G&gt;.  But hopefully, not powdered wigs...<br>
     <br>
