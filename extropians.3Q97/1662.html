"Streamlink", (v):  To eliminate a level of abstraction and replace it with a<br>
one-to-one correspondence which, although it requires more computing power, is<br>
actually simpler when viewed as a series of causal links.  Derived from<br>
"streamline" and the aforementioned causal links.<br>
<p>
"Simplestract", (v):  The inverse of streamlinking.  To add a level of<br>
abstraction which, although requiring less computing power to model,<br>
interposes additional causal links between two previously connected entities.<br>
<p>
Communism is an example of a simplestracted society; the government exists as<br>
an additional link between producer and consumer.  A true communism requires<br>
much less computing power to keep track of; the vast, tangled networks of<br>
inter-consumer links are replaced by single links to and from the centralized<br>
government.  Capitalism is streamlinked, having direct links to and from<br>
consumer - with attendant improvements in feedback quality, response time,<br>
efficiency, and direction.  Capitalism still requires far more computing<br>
power, however.<br>
<p>
I believe that the near future, now that we have the computing power, will be<br>
an extremely streamlinked place.  Money will be replaced by complex barter;<br>
advertising and sales by Firefly; the Constitution by v2.0; corporations by<br>
telecoordinated freelancers; and so on.  It might all happen at once, too...<br>
considering that all have an important social prerequisite in common.  Once<br>
people accept computer assistance for one, they'll be willing to accept the rest.<br>
