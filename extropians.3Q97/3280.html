A little note singing in a sea of silliness:<br>
<p>
Let's say that tomorrow, scientific evidence is discovered for an immortal<br>
soul that survives our death.  If that immortal soul preserved our memories<br>
but not our stream of consciousness, we would say our memories are<br>
"ourselves".  If that immortal soul preserved our consciousness but not our<br>
memories, we would call that consciousness "ourselves".<br>
<p>
For all the big fights over who we really are, most people want to live and<br>
will wind up making decisions on that basis.  In the situation above, it's<br>
entirely possible that your stream of consciousness is yourself, even though<br>
your immortal soul preserves memories alone. <br>
<p>
Is there an objective answer, dependent neither on our will to live nor on<br>
arbitrary postulates?  As far as I can see, the only real question, as regards<br>
uploading, cryonics or similar endeavors, is what type of interruption<br>
constitutes an objective evil, a negatively valued goal in ur-ethical terms. <br>
Until someone comes up with an objective Meaning of Life, we really have no<br>
*idea* what "death" is and whether it's a bad thing.<br>
<p>
In the case of cryonics, you freeze yourself because there are very few<br>
scenarios in which this is *worse* than not being frozen.  In the case of<br>
uploading, a few suicide volunteers go in first and figure out What's What for<br>
the rest of us.  Either way, who you "really" are can't be settled by these<br>
philosophical discussions.  The most you can do is torpedo specific<br>
objections, or demonstrate that uploading is OK given certain probable<br>
assumptions.  It doesn't matter, because you don't need to immediately upload<br>
the human race, just a few volunteers.<br>
<p>
No matter how tangled the philosophy, the question is not "Is it death?" but<br>
"Is it possible?"  Considering the 6,000 people that die every hour, why<br>
shouldn't a few volunteers run the risk of getting fatally caught in an<br>
elaborate philosophical conundrum, learning a few subjective millennia later<br>
that they died in their old bodies?  As fates go, this is considerably better<br>
- from a personal and ethical perspective - than getting hit by a truck.<br>
<p>
The only thing that seems certain is that our personal imperative to survive,<br>
and whatever ethical imperatives govern conscious continuity, will be derived<br>
from utterly and completely different sources.  If that which is intuitively<br>
abhorrent to us turns out to actually be wrong, it will be by purest coincidence.<br>
