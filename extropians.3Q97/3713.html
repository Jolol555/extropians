<i>&gt; Middle East, Europe, China, and elsewhere.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I anticipated something like that happening.  Food, medical supplies,<br>
certain consumer goods, and other things that change hands quickly and rapidly<br>
are likely to become...<br>
<p>
"Exchange nexuses."<br>
<p>
Such items will probably become the 'units' by which the price of something is<br>
explained.  Their existence will greatly simplify the computational work of<br>
cyclic debt cancellation.<br>
<p>
But it still isn't a monetary system.  Here's another way to look at it: <br>
Before the existence of commodities exchanges, grain got dumped into the<br>
harbor.  Now that we have the computing power, futures contracts should be<br>
available to everyone.  Once futures contracts are available to everyone,<br>
money is unnecessary and only gets in the way.  A lot of futures contracts<br>
will be for 'food'.  Many of the complex contracts will have 'food' as one<br>
term.  Food will bind the economy together, preventing sections from becoming<br>
isolated.  But it will still be possible to trade widgets for hamburgers,<br>
instead of food.  It will be possible to get everything you need in exchange<br>
for widgets through a multiplicity of contracts, some of them complex.  And<br>
thus it will become possible to increase production without catastrophic price changes.<br>
<p>
Another benefit is that if everything is barter, maybe somebody will take a<br>
look at the economy and say:  "Hey, these 5 hours a day of paperwork aren't<br>
actually producing anything!"  But that's the question of dispensing with the<br>
simplifying, information-losing, stultifying abstractions called<br>
"corporations"... which will wait for another day.<br>
