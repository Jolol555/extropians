<i>&gt; From: Arjen Kamphuis &lt;mountain@knoware.nl&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subject: Re: Extropianis (Protestants in Disguise?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Methinks most Extropians are relativly young, healty, white, highly</i><br>
<i>&gt; educated/skilled (self-taught or otherwise), well-payed people that work</i><br>
<i>&gt; 40-80 hrs a week (more when they are driving trucks ;-). And they hold a</i><br>
<i>&gt; firm belief that it is their effort and dicipline that gave them the</i><br>
<i>&gt; recources that they have at their disposal. </i><br>
<i>&gt; You won't find many members that lost their job/income/health-insurance at</i><br>
<i>&gt; 28 because of some crippling disease or are unable to do high-intensety</i><br>
<i>&gt; work because of a mild form of schizophrenia.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Those who do not work, shall not eat. Those who cannot work... well, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; long as they are not rotting on my doorstep it's really not my problem now</i><br>
<i>&gt; is it?"</i><br>
<p>
One of the wonderous "breath of fresh air" features of Ayn Rand's<br>
"Objectivism" is that even partially adopting the viewpoint gives one<br>
the ability to openly laugh at this sort of stupidity.<br>
<p>
I have *no* obligations to other human beings other than the ones I<br>
freely accepted myself. NONE. ZERO.<br>
<p>
I could argue with you all day about our "little dying schizophrenic<br>
brothers" and whether or not we have any obligations to them, and<br>
whether or not I'm self made or "privileged" or some such rot, but the<br>
argument would be based on a fundamentally flawed premise -- that the<br>
answer to the question of whether some people are "privileged" even<br>
matters.<br>
<p>
I have NO obligation to someone dying in the street. Any appeals to<br>
emotion you can make stating otherwise are all based on religious or<br>
quasi-religious tenets, more or less, or based on the false appeal to<br>
"what if you were that person". Well, you can argue that it might be<br>
IN MY INTEREST to see a society where people are "helpful" (I didn't<br>
say it would be true, but you can argue it) but you have no basis at<br>
all for claiming any *obligation*.<br>
<p>
Whether my superior position comes from being hard working and<br>
intelligent or from "privilege" is utterly meaningless. I HAVE NO<br>
OBLIGATIONS TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE, OTHER THAN THOSE I FREELY AGREED<br>
TO, PERIOD. Even the obligations I take on are only "obligations" in<br>
the sense that I believe it would be harmful for me not to fulfill<br>
them -- there is no physical law comparable to the Newton's Laws of<br>
Motion that forces me into such an obligation, although it does turn<br>
out that, given repeated trials, it is usually best for one to fulfill<br>
one's freely accepted contractual obligations.<br>
<p>
As it turns out, I generally decide to help other individuals on a<br>
regular basis when the whim strikes me, and I have on several<br>
occassions assisted at the sites of accidents, but ONLY BECAUSE I FEEL<br>
LIKE DOING SO, AND BECAUSE IT PLEASES ME TO DO SO. I actually *do*<br>
believe it is "nice" to help out those who are *truly* in trouble<br>
because of accident (i.e. someone who is in a car that has just been<br>
crushed by a truck that lost control of its brakes), and I frequently<br>
help friends find jobs and such. I do not, however, have any<br>
obligation whatsoever to be helpful to others. NONE.<br>
<p>
Appeals to the contrary to me will be met with derision.<br>
<p>
