Hi Danny,<br>
<p>
As someone who has always been fascinated with the story of<br>
Atlantis (I like to think of them as the first Extropians!) I would<br>
like to correct a few misconceptions.<br>
<p>
As E Shaun Russell has already pointed out, we know where<br>
"Atlantis" is! The remains of what we think of as Atlantis is the<br>
current Greek island of Santorini, formally known as Thera. The<br>
people who lived there are currently referred to as the Minoan.<br>
<p>
Thera (and its people) was largely destroyed in a caldera, the most<br>
powerful type of volcanic explosion we know of, the current island<br>
of Santorini is crescent shaped and a visit there will impress you<br>
with how big Thera actually was. It is believed the volcanic<br>
activity had been increasing steadily for days, possibly weeks,<br>
before the caldera occurred. The Minoan's apparently fled to<br>
another stronghold, the island of Crete, where they were virtually<br>
wiped out by the tidal wave following the massive explosion.<br>
<p>
 Poets, Plato, time, gossip, and Hollywood (and Donovan ;) ) have<br>
done the rest. A great deal of this has only been discovered since<br>
the late fifties and is still going on today. They do seem to have<br>
been considerably more advanced than their neighbors, but nothing<br>
on the "Hollywood scale". (i.e. no nuclear power or any other such<br>
thing.)<br>
<p>
Truth is once again stranger, and more wonderful than fiction.<br>
<p>
We could be Atlantis.<br>
<p>
