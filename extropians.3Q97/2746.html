do<br>

(I<br>

<p>
No, it's *them* who have the bad attitude!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Also no doubt noticed by some of the more astute members of this list is</i><br>
my<br>
<i>&gt;  bent toward anti-authorianism.  Hence one of my favorite questions over</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;  years to proauthoritarian types is</i><br>
<p>
There's not such thing as anti-authorianism, just normal and cattle.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  "At what point is it morally and ethically correct for a group to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;  something which is morally and ethically incorrect for an individual?"  </i><br>
<p>
When they have the power to break the individuals kneecaps!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  That is...presumably it is incorrect for individuals to steal...but if it</i><br>
is<br>
<i>&gt;  called taxation (by a group) then it is OK.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Presumably it is incorrect for individuals to kill....but if it is called</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "execution" (by a group)..then it is OK.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Presumably it is incorrect for individuals to extort, ....but susrely you</i><br>
get<br>
<i>&gt;  the point.  My question has always been what is the minimium group size?</i><br>
<p>
Most groups can't get away with taxation, execution and extortion.  You have<br>
to either use offense, divinity or both.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Isn't it written somewhere (Federalists Papers? Constitutional supporting</i><br>
<i>&gt;  documentation...some political speech by muckity-muck?) that the</i><br>
governments<br>
<i>&gt;  just rights are derived from it's citizenry?  Suppose the citizenry</i><br>
doesn't<br>
<i>&gt;  HAVE that right...then how can the coersive and oppressive state claim any</i><br>
<i>&gt;  moral justification toward exercising same?.....other than force that is.</i><br>
<p>
"rights" are a form of coercion.  You only need a 'right to free speech' if<br>
there's someone trying to take it away.  In the case of most Western<br>
governments they're taking freedom away and then giving you 'rights', and the<br>
thing about rights is - unlike freedom - they can be forgotten, looked over<br>
or just plain ignored.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Another thing that I've often wondered.  Suppose a politician is making a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  speech saying things that I think are admirable and true...only the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  politician doesn't beleive what he is saying...he is only saying it to get</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  my support....</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Is that politican lying?  Even though he is telling the truth... ?  Does</i><br>
<i>&gt;  beleif in what you are saying influence whether it's true or not...?</i><br>
<p>
Short answer "hell no."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  At which point I was generally accused of having a "bad attitude"...which</i><br>
<i>&gt;  presumably won the argument in favor of authoritarianism.</i><br>
<p>
It's like those people who ask for a fight and then say "you're not worth<br>
it.." and walk away like they've won (A fun thing to do is approach them<br>
later and don't give them the chance to say *anything*)<br>
