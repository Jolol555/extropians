<i>&gt; hear what people think of this first.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
The political philosopher (still the best theorist and critic of<br>
totalitarianism I've ever read) Hannah Arendt said in an interview that<br>
"If one is attacked as a Jew one must defend oneself as a Jew.  Not as a<br>
German, not as a world-citizen, not as an upholder of the rights of Man,<br>
or whatever..."  Her point was that antisemitism (like racism, like<br>
sexism, like heterosexism, or what have you) can too easily exist in<br>
societies that imagine themselves staunch defenders of these more<br>
general conceptions.  The problem is that certain kinds of people, for<br>
lots of mostly contingent historical and sociocultural reasons, come to<br>
be thought of as less-than-properly-human and the smooth function of<br>
regimes of civility based on respect for rights crank along quite<br>
cheerfully even when these less-than-properly-human humans are treated<br>
unfairly (or sometimes even genocidally).  There is no question that<br>
lesbian and gay people in the United States are second-class citizens. <br>
Our intimate associations are not recognized, we are unable to serve<br>
openly in the military, the sexual acts by means of which we express<br>
desire for one another are largely illegal in half the states, the<br>
protections from discrimination available to most unpopular minorites<br>
are expressely denied us in most cases.  Whatever one feels about<br>
marriage, military service, antidiscrimination laws and the like (like<br>
most extropians I for one would be happy to see the whole governmental<br>
dog-and-pony show junked), the point is that the denial of these<br>
benefits and protections to one group among all others *symptomizes*<br>
something deep and dangerous about this society.  Certainly scares me. <br>
This is especially chilling in the U.S. where lesbians and gays are<br>
simultaneously second-class citizens legally speaking, but the darlings<br>
of media culture, treated as exceptional and extraordinary, monsters of<br>
desire and talent, fashion millionaires and such.  To be less than human<br>
legally and more than human culturally is a heady cocktail to sip --<br>
ask the Jews of Weimar Germany.  I see deep affinities between queer<br>
politics and extropian politics -- to the extent that either of these<br>
can be said to exist at all.  Enemies of Christian fundamentalism,<br>
dogmatisms of every variety, state and social repressiveness in<br>
general, queers and extropes have a lot in common (even those of us who<br>
aren't strictly speaking *already* both).  Believe me, I am utterly<br>
uninterested in being known as a fag instead of an individual.  I am<br>
uninterested in special rights, but equal ones will suit me just fine.  My<br>
intimate associations are the last thing I would want to provide the basis<br>
for anyone paying attention to me.<br>
	That said, I'll just add quickly a question about<br>
antidiscrimination legislation.  I know the general libertarian take that<br>
it is wrong to tell an owner of a business just how she should behave, and<br>
further that to the extent that homophobia and other attitudes like it are<br>
irrational it is to be expected that the market will weed them out as more<br>
tolerant individuals make fatter profits (tho' I understand that this<br>
intuition is controverted by lots of respectable economic research).<br>
However, I wonder if it is possible to translate the general idea of<br>
antidiscrimination laws in terms that will be more attractive to<br>
libertarians anyway.  To the extent that every contract relies for its<br>
intelligibility on a welter of unstated assumptions, why can't we<br>
interpret acts of discrimination simply as breaches of contract?  If we<br>
assume that most people imagine that they are being hired to do a job and<br>
do it well, why can't we say then that, should this be the case, an<br>
employer who fires demotes or otherwise unfairly treats an employee in the<br>
service of some fool prejudice is breaching contract with her -- unless<br>
something about the employer's racism, sexism, or whatever had a very<br>
conspicuous place *in* the contract to begin with?  Would this<br>
interpretation of the spirit of antidiscrimination legislation go down<br>
smoother?  It doesn't leave the distasteful residue that the "wanting<br>
something for nothing" interpretations mostly on offer yield -- at least<br>
for me.  Best, Dale<br>
