[snip of some interesting galactic engineering]<br>

It will take a while to accomplish all this. At the speed of light,<br>
your acquisition probes will take about 50Kyears to reach the limits<br>
of a 50K lightyear sphere surroundng the galaxy. Once there, they can<br>
start sending all the matter back to the collection point. Assuming<br>
transit speeds of .5c, you will expend two thirds of the mass to<br>
accelerate the other third at the start and decelerrate it at the<br>
end of the trip, so after an additional 100K years, you will have<br>
accumulated "only" one third of the galaxy's mass. If you are<br>
willing to wait, you can use longer transit times and end up with<br>
more mass. Of course, you will be able to begin construction with<br>
material accumulated much earlier in the program, as soon<br>
as you reach the galactic center, about 25Kyears from now.<br>
