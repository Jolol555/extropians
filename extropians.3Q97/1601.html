In a message dated 97-08-03 20:17:42 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; they hold that erectus might<br>
 have just "run down" small game like antelopes by virtue of superior<br>
 endurance and then clubbed them to death in their exhaustion. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
The "cursorial hunter" scenario.<br>
<p>
As an aside...and taking no sides...has anyone besides me noticed that what<br>
the US and State Governments have done in an effort to eliminate racism has<br>
validated what the white supremicists have been saying all along?<br>
<p>
The government appears to be saying...via it's actions....that blacks are<br>
incompetent...inept...and can't make it on their own...because of them nasty<br>
mean white guys...who they can't compete with...so the wunnerful guv will<br>
give them a hand.<br>
<p>
I'm not saying I agree with the guv....I don't.  I'm just asking ...isn't<br>
this what it appears to be saying?<br>
