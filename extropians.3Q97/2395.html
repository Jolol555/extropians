<i>&gt;&lt;&lt; Lots of things can be argued, but the notion that children, arbitrarily</i><br>
<i>&gt; defined, are either chattel of the parents or chattel of the state, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the former view "would have to be the libertarian position" is </i><br>
<i>&gt; seriously troubling to me.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yep...lots of things can be argued...but it seems that they gotta be one or</i><br>
<i>&gt;the other..saying that they "own themselves"...yet are "wards of the state"</i><br>
<i>&gt;or "wards of their parents" is a bit contradictory isn't it?</i><br>
<p>
I didn't say they "own themselves"--but I am not positive they don't.<br>
<p>
OK, first, some background:<br>
<p>
I consider myself principled (these days), and one of the principles I try<br>
to maintain is the non-initiation of force or violence. This doesn't make<br>
me a pacifist, of course--non-initiation is distinct from non-employment.<br>
It does mean that if I'm ever again in loco parentis, I'll do all I can to<br>
keep from using corporal punishment, especially the severe kind. I wince<br>
when I see people who've clearly screwed up in that regard, and are<br>
programming their kids to be poor at handling their lives--but I don't<br>
scoop them up and rescue them, because I *can't*. This doesn't mean I don't<br>
feel the urge. And it doesn't mean I'm holier-than-those parents, and it<br>
doesn't mean there aren't some kids (boys, probably) who don't "need" a<br>
"touch of the hickory" to "get their attention"--I just hope I never have<br>
to raise one. That may be a foolish hope; perhaps some day I'll find that out.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Seems that's why the name "children"...when one ceases to be of that category</i><br>
<i>&gt;then one is responsible  for(i.e. "owns") oneself. The boundry of that</i><br>
<i>&gt;classification being defined by culture, law etc.</i><br>
<p>
"culture, law etc." covers a lot of ground. In Rome it was permissible to<br>
put one's slave to torture or death. Yet in Rome a slave could buy his<br>
freedom; this almost never happened in the antebellum South. <br>
<p>
My point is, in part, that the boundary of that classification remains<br>
badly defined. <br>
<p>
Me, I'd like to see a world where a person of any age could qualify for<br>
full adulthood--_all rights, all the time, all at once_... but I don't see<br>
that in the cards. If it were, kids with sufficient motivation could<br>
qualify to move out of a hellhole (if _THEY_ thought that was what it was)<br>
and move into, say, a special youth-hostel-style quasi-commune-condo<br>
(commercially run at a profit, naturally) to continue their own maturation<br>
minus the hell. Now that's what *I* call child support.<br>
<p>
As I said, I don't see that in the cards--and I don't know how such a<br>
system could be fairly administered via The State, which currently *does*<br>
intervene inappropriately and monopolistically.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;My position is that it's none of my business what someone else does...with</i><br>
<i>&gt;his dog..his property...or his children...however reprehensible or noble it</i><br>
<i>&gt;may be...as long as I have no responsibility...am not damaged....then I have</i><br>
<i>&gt;no authority..and would be well advised to mind my own business.</i><br>
<p>
I think I understand where you're coming from. I too tend to prefer minding<br>
my own business.<br>
However, by your logic, every one of those 3 million you mentioned earlier<br>
in this thread is "none of your business". I'm not trying for a cheap<br>
rhetorical point, here, I'm trying to point out that it's a serious matter,<br>
and as I said, sticky...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I and society...have no moral athority to intervene. The most I can do is</i><br>
<i>&gt;disapprove....and/or disassociate myself with that person and his</i><br>
<i>&gt;activities....I think the Jews used a technique...shunning....towards similar</i><br>
<i>&gt;ends....in times past.</i><br>
<p>
So did some of the Romans toward other Romans who mistreated their slaves.<br>
It only has any effect when reputation matters.<br>
<p>
I say I _have_ some moral obligation (not "authority") to intervene if<br>
things are bad enough. <br>
I say that because I feel that children are not just property, they're<br>
people-in-training, cadet people, and because if I were a kid in some<br>
circumstances I would _want_ a third party to rescue me, to "steal me" from<br>
my "rightful owners". But I'm not sure where the line is. And I'm not in<br>
favor of delegating the action to some faceless civil servant acting under<br>
color of a spurious authority.<br>
<p>
Consider the following two cases:<br>
<p>
I recall a situation where two sub-teen boys beat and eventually mangled<br>
(using a railroad train) a younger boy. Somewhere in all that, the<br>
four-year-old victim died. Before that, he was in obvious distress in front<br>
of witnesses, none of whom intervened. Since all three are someone else's<br>
child, I take it it should be none of my business should I see such a thing<br>
happen--barring of course shunning the parents? Or, since they were not<br>
fully human, would it be appropriate for me to shoot the 9-year-old and the<br>
7-year-old out of hand, the way I might a pair of feral dogs?<br>
<p>
More directly: there was the case of the woman who strapped her two kids in<br>
the car and sent the car on a little swim, because she had the impression<br>
that they were the only thing standing in the way of her relationship with<br>
a man who wasn't sure he was ready to be a father. If the kids were her<br>
property, ditching the car is the same as ditching the car plus kids,<br>
right? Property is property.<br>
Then again, by rights of salvage, once she abandoned them, anyone who<br>
rescued or recovered them would be their owner, right?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;If you have responsibility then you must have authority to enforce the</i><br>
<i>&gt;necesities of that responsibility...the two are coupled.  The current</i><br>
<i>&gt;situation is de-coupled...as a result it's all screwed up&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Any other position puts me in a position of</i><br>
<i>&gt;(superiority/authority:responsible for his actions)  over that person...Slave</i><br>
<i>&gt;Owner...which I am not and don't intend to be...</i><br>
<p>
Unless you procreate? Sorry, that's a cheap shot.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;however much some beg to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;owned. Nor do I enjoy BEING owned...as is the current state of</i><br>
<i>&gt;affairs...hopefully the advancing technology will continue the age-old trend</i><br>
<i>&gt;of diminishing the power of the state....(slavers).relative to that of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;populance (slaves)</i><br>
<p>
Here we are "in violent agreement".<br>
<p>
My point remains that children are a tough one to be single-principled<br>
about, for me, anyway... and there are some people who _aren't_ fit to be<br>
parents... and I continue to wish I could do something about it. I'm _not_<br>
saying I want the _state_ to do something about it. It boils down to "am I<br>
my brother's keeper?"... and the answer that comes to me is "it depends".<br>
And I wish it didn't, because it would make my life easier.<br>
<p>
Now, if duelling were legal, someone who cared could call bad parents<br>
out... ( 1/2 :) )<br>
<p>
ObExtropianContent:<br>
One can conceive of an explicit contract-based system of genuine "child<br>
support" in the true sense, with potential parents agreeing to binding<br>
arbitration if their kids object to the way they're being brought up, but I<br>
don't know how well it'd catch on--what's the parent's motivation? IMO,<br>
this turns out to have some connection with the "when is it all right to<br>
abuse an AI?" thread.<br>
