     I freely grant that I should learn more diplomacy. Thank you for the <br>
     reminder. Perhaps some of the other correspondents to this list should <br>
     learn more science. Perhaps not.<br>

     You're very gracious.  I was a little pensive that I was potentially <br>
     starting a flame (fanning them bores me &lt;G&gt;).  <br>
     <br>
     I dodge the more sensational threads.  The current thread on techno <br>
     music (although I'm an occasional raver at 39!) doesn't charge me <br>
     either.  I loved the the implications on uploading although it got a <br>
     little dry after a while.  This list is addictive to me (YIKES, I'm <br>
     being assimilated) and I can essentially go with the flow.  Balance is <br>
     my middle name...no wait, it's Brian...or does it have a "Y". Where's <br>
     my license?<br>
