Natasha More:<br>
<i>&gt;with a director of social services at West Hollywood's City Hall.  We</i><br>
<i>&gt;discussed the issues raised on this list.  His comments were very positive.</i><br>
<i>&gt;He attributed much of the strides in the gay and lesbian community as having</i><br>
<i>&gt;been boosted by some organizations in particular and what the future</i><br>
<i>&gt;directions will be.  </i><br>
<p>
I can guess which organizations he speaks of, and their leadership <br>
tends to express cautious optimism at best, with a strong emphasis on <br>
the tasks ahead, and some apologies for the severe tactical mistakes <br>
made over the gay marriage issue, as per a recent State of the <br>
Movement meeting convened here in DC.  If you plan to include this topic <br>
as part of your gender web page, please consider including some of their <br>
comments.  <br>
<p>
If anyone wants further info:  Cathy Renna of GLAAD and Ric Rosendall of <br>
GLAA, Elizabeth Birch of HRC, and the fine folks at NGLTF maintain web <br>
sites that provide this sort of information as well.  <br>
<p>
I don't think I have anything further to say about surgical sex <br>
change, but I agree that we probably have not fully discussed the <br>
topic either.<br>
<p>
Kathryn Aegis (who recently said to hell with four sets of rings and <br>
only wears one small silver rainbow one on the left hand.  By Sarah's <br>
standards, a micro-Walkman-stereovision, with headphones.)<br>
