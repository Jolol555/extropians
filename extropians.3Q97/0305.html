<i>&gt;Man</i><br>
<i>&gt;made air vehicles have always had maintenance requirements of between</i><br>
<i>&gt;20-100 man hours per flight hour. </i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure that your low end number is literally true. I'm going to <br>
visit my local F.O.B pretty soon, and I'll try to get their numbers <br>
for the low end. It may (in fact, I expect it will) depend on the <br>
timescale you measure.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;higher maintenance requirements, with the exception of some of our new</i><br>
<i>&gt;military planes like the F-22, but vehicles like the space shuttle and</i><br>
<i>&gt;the stealth bomber are still way up above the top of the range.</i><br>
<p>
Bzzzt! Have you further considered that that's because they're absurdly <br>
specified and designed, by political and pocket-lining <br>
creatures? You do know the story of the B-1 and of F-111s, right?<br>
To take the latter example, suppose I insisted on fielding a full <br>
complement of F-111s (the B variant, I think) fully loaded with Phoenix <br>
on an aircraft carrier. You're going to have hella high maintenance<br>
if you really want to keep everything flying; in fact the carrier may<br>
never be the same, either:). Those tubs land *hard*.<br>
<p>
MTBF very much depends on how rich you are, how carefree you are (i.e. <br>
"what's a failure?"), and how superior your tech is to the requirements. <br>
I suspect strongly that the maint-to-flight hours ratio (whatever that's <br>
called in aero, I forget) is, too. <br>
<p>
The long term data isn't in for things like composites and the Zoche <br>
turbo diesel, but I suspect they, or what comes after them, will <br>
start stretching those numbers out into the sub-1 range.<br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;As for your assertion of any visitors not being detected, this goes</i><br>
<i>&gt;against logic. Given that some group, corporation, or government on</i><br>
<i>&gt;another planet would have shelled out billions if not trillions of</i><br>
<i>&gt;EBE-bucks for such an expedition, the idea that they would not try to</i><br>
<i>&gt;wring out the maximum PR, scientific, or economic value from that</i><br>
<i>&gt;investment is ludicrous.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, but why is this a given at all? And who says they'd derive any <br>
benefit from being seen? How can you (or Hara Ra) be sure you know <br>
what their payoff matrix is for be3ing seen? What if their motto <br>
really is "Primum non nocere (at least at first...)"?<br>
