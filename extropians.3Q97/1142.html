Interesting.  I recently posted to the effect that I now don't take<br>
trips very seriously anymore - I actually enjoy them (on the odd<br>
occasion) as mostly just pretty visual and conceptual nonsense that<br>
occasionally throws up something that proves interesting in the context<br>
of 'normal' experience; and one of the main reasons for this change of<br>
attitude was reading the 'Prelude' to 'Consciousness Explained by Daniel<br>
C Dennett, where he talks about dreams and a party game called<br>
'Psychoanalysis' (it has other names too, I think).<br>
<p>
The party game goes like this: (quoting Dennett) "... one person, the<br>
dupe, is told that while he is out of the room, one member of the<br>
assembled party will be called upon to relate a recent dream.  This will<br>
give everybody else in the room the story line of that dream so that<br>
when the dupe returns to the room and begins questioning the assembled<br>
party, the dreamer's identity will be hidden in the crowd of responders.<br>
The dupe's job is to ask yes/no questions of the assembled group until<br>
he has figured out the dream narrative to a suitable degree of detail,<br>
at which point the dupe is to psychoanalyze the dreamer, and use the<br>
analysis to identify him or her.<br>
<p>
"Once the dupe is out of the room, the host explains to the rest of the<br>
party that no one is to relate a dream, that the party is to answer the<br>
dupe's questions according to the following simple rule: if the last<br>
letter of the last word of the question is in the first half of the<br>
alphabet, the question is to be answered in the affirmative, and all<br>
other questions are to be answered in the negative, with one proviso: a<br>
non-contradiction override rule to the effect that later questions are<br>
not to be given answers that contradict earlier anwers.  <br>
<p>
"... When the dupe returns to the room and begins questioning, he gets a<br>
more or less random, or at any rate arbitrary, series of yeses and noes<br>
in response.  The results are often entertaining. ... When the dupe<br>
eventually decides that the dreamer - whoever he or she is - must be a<br>
very sick and troubled individual, the assembled party gleefully retorts<br>
that the dupe himself is the author of the "dream".   This is not<br>
strictly true, of course.  In one sense, the dupe is the author by virtue<br>
of the questions he was inspired to ask.  (No one *else* proposed putting<br>
the three gorillas in the rowboat with the nun.)  But in another sense,<br>
the dream simply has no author, and that is the whole point. Here we see<br>
a process of narrative production, of detail accumulation, with no<br>
authorial intentions or plans at all - an illusion with no illusionist.<br>
<p>
"The structure of this party game bears a striking resemblance to the<br>
structure of a family of well-regarded models of perceptual systems.  It<br>
is widely held that human vision, for instance, cannot be explained as<br>
an *entirely* "data-driven" or "bottom-up" process, but needs, at the<br>
highest levels, to be supplemented by a few "expectation-driven" rounds<br>
of hypothesis testing (or something analogous to hypothesis testing).<br>
<p>
"...Whatever the utlimate verdict turns out to be on generate-and-test<br>
theories of perception, we can see that they support a simple and<br>
powerful account of hallucination.  All we need suppose must happen for<br>
an otherwise normal perceptual system to be thrown into a hallucinatory<br>
mode is for the hypothesis-generation side of the cycle (the expectation-<br>
driven side) to operate normally, while the data-driven side of the<br>
cycle (the confirmation side) goes into a disordered or random or<br>
arbitrary round of confirmation and disconfirmation, just as in the party<br>
game.  In other words, if noise in the data channel is arbitrarily<br>
amplified into "confirmations" and "disconfirmations" (the arbitrary yes<br>
and no answers in the party game), the current expectations, concerns,<br>
obsessions, and worries of the victim will lead to framing questions or<br>
hypotheses whose content is guaranteed to reflect those interests, and so<br>
a "story" will unfold in the perceptual system without an author.<br>
<p>
"...This provides in the most direct possible way a link between the<br>
emotional state of the hallucinator and the content of the hallucinations<br>
produced.  Hallucinations are usually related in their content to the<br>
current concerns of the hallucinator, and this model of hallucination<br>
provides for that feature without the intervention of an implausibly<br>
knowledgeable internal storyteller who has a theory or model of the<br>
victim's psychology.  Why, for instance, does the hunter on the last day<br>
of deer season see a deer, complete with antlers and white tail, while<br>
looking at a black cow or another hunter in an orange jacket?  Because<br>
his internal questioner is obsessively asking: "Is it a deer?" and<br>
getting NO for an answer until finally a bit of noise in the system gets<br>
mistakenly amplified into a YES, with catastrophic results."<br>
<p>
This ties in with your theory above, Hara Ra, does it not?  It's easily<br>
extrapolated both to ordinary dreams and to psychedelic experience, in<br>
terms of both sensory and conceptual hallucinations.<br>
<p>
Of course, even if this is the correct explanation, there's still room<br>
for the possibility of hyperdimensional communications from transcendental<br>
machine elves and Psylocybin Powers alongside it! But that would make<br>
the job of separating the nonsense from the genuine hyperdimensional<br>
stuff very tricky indeed.<br>
<p>
At any rate, this explanation of Dennett's had a very 'cooling',<br>
Epicurean effect on *my* psychedelic experience!<br>
