Somebody mentioned Jared Diamond.  I'll second that: the book is _Guns,<br>
Germs, and Steel_, although _The Third Chimpanzee_ has some speculations<br>
as well, some of which may have to be modified in light of a 400,000<br>
year old wooden spear.  On the other hand he figured Neaderthals weren't<br>
related to us, and he might be proven right there.<br>
<p>
Personally, I'd like to see Diamond and Jane Jacobs tackle this issue as<br>
a team.  WIth that off of my chest I'll try to outline the thesis.<br>
Specifically we want to explain, preferably without referring to 'race',<br>
why cities, writing, advanced metallurgy, agriculture, and charming<br>
disearses, among other things, developed on the Eurasian continent, and<br>
not on the other three/four (or to only limited degrees.)  The dominant<br>
factor he identifies is the size, orientation, and plant and animal<br>
diversity of Eurasia.  This allowed agriculture and thus oversized<br>
cities, as well as heavy animal labor.  Large concentrations of people<br>
living with multiple species of animals exposed Eurasians to many more<br>
diseases, which millenia later they were able to inflict on Americans<br>
and Australians.  Large cities could also boost technology.  Widespread<br>
trading networks were more feasible due to the size and geography of<br>
Eurasia, including the east-west orientation allowing domesticated<br>
plants to spread easily,  Agricultural spread through Africa or the<br>
Americas was harder, because more different climates were involved.<br>
<p>
Why agriculture was mostly Eurasian in origin has to do with luck, or<br>
possibly with greater diversity.  Most of the world's large-seeded wild<br>
grains lived in the Middle East.  This kind of helped.  Animals... well,<br>
Diamond claims there are many traits a large species must have to be<br>
domesticable, and most large mammals fail one of them.  Most of the ones<br>
which don't fail his traits are in Eurasia, and are the domesticated<br>
species -- horses, pigs, cows, goats, and sheep, along with specialties<br>
like yak and reindeer.  The exception is the llama.  He skips over dogs<br>
for some reason -- perhaps not big enough.  If you accept that it's<br>
unlikely that any particular species will be suitable, it's easy to<br>
explain why Australia and the Americas have no or one domesticated<br>
species: most large mammals on those continents died off at about the<br>
same time humans showed up.  Given that these species had survived<br>
several previous ice age cycles Diamond doesn't buy the climate change<br>
explanation, and posits that when they met Cro-Magnon man without any<br>
fear of large bipeds they turned -- briefly -- into walking<br>
supermarkets.<br>
<p>
Why Africa, with nearly as many species as Eurasia, should have none<br>
domesticable, he doesn't touch.  I'd suggest reversing the process --<br>
having evolved with us for several million years, all the African<br>
species are either too vicious (zebras) or too panicky (gazelles) to be<br>
useful.  As Eurasia only had hominids around for a million years (with<br>
us not being terribly threatening hunters to anything which ran away) a<br>
fraction of the species hadn't finished either evolving full defenses or<br>
going extinct when we started accidentally domesticating them.<br>
<p>
If the above wasn't entirely coherent, well, it's a dense book.  I<br>
recommend it.  Well thought out, well argued, and with a good bit of<br>
evidence.  It might still be wrong, particularly in details -- there<br>
might be overlooked evidence, or stuff might get superseded -- but it's<br>
the most complex and plausible attempt as I know of.  And he writes<br>
well, I think.<br>
<p>
Jacobs, in _The Economy of Cities_ plausibly reversed the usual<br>
development process -- small trading cities developed first, near<br>
unusual raw materials (obsidian, perhaps) and agriculture and animal<br>
husbandry began by accident, due to the diversity and large number of<br>
seeds and tamed animals brought in for trade.  But this doesn't affect<br>
Diamond much; we'd tack on that the trade cities of the Middle East were able<br>
to develop farming early because the species in the area happened to be<br>
most suitable.  Then they spread through much of Eurasia because<br>
climate, or at least day lengths, were similar.  Allowing increased size<br>
of cities and encouraging trade among cities, which in Jacobs' world is<br>
what fosters their development in the first place, as they begin making<br>
locally what they used to import.  Throw in some diseases and you have<br>
Eurasian civlization.<br>
