The following was just received by me on another list, so I'm posting it<br>
here, in this thread, as I think it pertinent to the ongoing discussion:<br>
<p>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
In promoting passage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, its<br>
sponsors, and those working to see it passed, made ten promises:  <br>
<p>
1. To operate entirely under the direction and control of the<br>
President and his appointees to the Board of Governors.<br>
<p>
2. To pay interest to the government for the privilege of printing<br>
Federal Reserve Notes as the nation's currency.<br>
<p>
3. To perform many banking services for the government free of<br>
charge.<br>
<p>
4. To manage the nation's money supply so as to stabilize the<br>
dollar which, in turn, would stabilize prices.<br>
<p>
5. To remove the United States from the control of Wall Street.<br>
<p>
6. To prevent depressions and eliminate "boom and bust" cycles.<br>
<p>
7. To be a friend and helper to farmers and to the monetary needs<br>
of small businesses.<br>
<p>
8. To create a system that would remain forever decentralized, so<br>
each Federal Reserve Bank would have as much influence in monetary<br>
policies as the one in New York City. <br>
<p>
9. To protect American interests against foreign monetary assaults.<br>
<p>
10. To supervise and inspect local banks and provide funds when<br>
they were pressed by unexpected demands.<br>
<p>
<p>
Contrary to promises, the effects of the Federal Reserve Act have<br>
been disastrous:<br>
<p>
1. Judged by the promises at the time the act was passed, including<br>
a stable currency and elimination of boom and bust cycles, the Fed<br>
must be rated, at best, a colossal failure.<br>
<p>
2. The Federal Reserve action of curtailing the nation's money<br>
supply by a third in 1929 converted a serious recession into a<br>
disastrous depression, destroying one-third of the nation's banks<br>
in the process.<br>
<p>
3. Judged on the basis of the U.S. Constitution and by the intent<br>
of its framers, the Federal Reserve Act and amendments are clearly<br>
unconstitutional.<br>
<p>
4. The present system, requiring people and businesses to pay<br>
interest to the banks on every Federal Reserve dollar in<br>
circulation, is a devastating and needless burden, adding to<br>
bankruptcies in a recession and severely hampering recovery. An<br>
Honest Money System, based on debt-free money, is essential to the<br>
economic well-being of the people all across the U.S.<br>
<p>
5. An unstable national money supply is a debilitating handicap at<br>
best and, at worst, not only causes but worsens "boom or bust"<br>
business cycles so destructive of the people's best interests.<br>
<p>
6. The people of America now suffer from needless recessions<br>
brought on by the cumulative effects of inflation and<br>
interest-bearing debt financing encouraged by the Federal Reserve<br>
System.  <br>
