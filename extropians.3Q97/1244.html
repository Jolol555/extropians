In a message dated 97-07-28 05:35:40 EDT, I said:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt;        all the participants are "experts" in their respective<br>
<i> &gt; fields...that is they have oodles of credentials, awards, and</i><br>
<i> &gt; experience.  How is one expert to beleived and another one not? </i><br>
<i> &gt; Why or why not is one Ph.d more credible than another. </i><br>
<p>
and you said:<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;I think critical thinking is the key. If an expert claims something,</i><br>
<i> &gt;we have to evaluate his claims from the evidence he presents, what we</i><br>
<i> &gt;know, and how well he can argue his case. &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
But that is the problem you see.  I've been browsing the "Cold Fusion" and<br>
"infinite energy " crowd.  (as an example)...they make a very compelling<br>
argument...lots of Ph.d's..lots of papers....lots of experimental<br>
evidence....lots of international conferecess....Best I can tell they're<br>
every bit as credible as say,  Thin-film  metals deposition....of gamma-ray<br>
litography...(just to pick two fields of which I know nothing and someone<br>
could baffle me with bullshit)<br>
<p>
And as Dr. Mallow (Infinite Energy)...documents....there is tremendous<br>
resistance to the Popular Wisdom....The wright bros.  were flying for<br>
YEARS...just down the road from the newspaper....while that same newspaper<br>
was denouncing the "impossibility of flight"....and the reception that PC's<br>
received in the 70's....etc. etc. ad nauseum...<br>
<p>
As far as trusting someone else's opinion....fine and good....But let's take<br>
Carl Sagan and an example....A nobel winning astronomer?....how many<br>
industrial scale blunders did he make?  Like the nuclear winter scenario.<br>
<p>
Or Dr. Paul Ehrlichman (the bugologists) and his starvation scenario for the<br>
70s.<br>
<p>
I despair.<br>
