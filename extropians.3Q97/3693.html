<p>
Sure...  Let's start by refining what we mean by "problems," or which<br>
problems need to be solved.<br>
<p>
Extropian Problem 1:  Global pain, suffering and death.<br>
<p>
Speaking personally, I have adopted an extropian philosophy in order to<br>
solve this very problem.  Extropians, as we all know, are intensely focused<br>
on overcoming death: we are very interested in advances in immortality,<br>
cryonics, and the declining cost of living.  T.O. Morrow defines extropy<br>
as: "a measure of intelligence, information, energy, life, experience,<br>
diversity, opportunity, and growth. The collection of forces which oppose<br>
entropy."  I assert that most extropians have made the elimination of<br>
global pain, suffering and death their main concern.  I certainly have.<br>
<p>
Long term solutions:<br>
<p>
a)  Develop immortality through technology.<br>

<a href="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Individual/Cryonics/">http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Individual/Cryonics/</a><br>
By eliminating death, you solve this problem completely.<br>
<p>
b) Patience.<br>

Rapidly escalating productivity will bring wealth for all.<br>
<p>
Near term solutions:<br>
<p>
c) Eliminate gov't barriers to entry in all industries.<br>
<a href="http://www.free-market.com">http://www.free-market.com</a> or http://www.cato.org<br>
License laws, high taxes, and price controls create monopolies by<br>
obstructing small business.<br>
<p>
Oppose oppressive and totalitarian governments.<br>
<a href="http://www.amnesty.org">http://www.amnesty.org</a><br>
I can't say that I entirely endorse all of the Universal Declaration of<br>
Human Rights, though it is a good start...  After about Article 22 it<br>
starts to contradict itself.  Does anybody here know of a better list of<br>
human rights which extropians might support worldwide?<br>
<p>
Employ the poor.<br>
By hiring the poor, you help another while they help you.  So if there's<br>
something that you wanted done and you have a little money to spare, hire<br>
someone who's poor.  Pay them in cash.  Think about this the next time you<br>
see someone holding out a cardboard sign that says "Will work for food."<br>
<p>
Extropian Problem 2:  Extropy is not well accepted by most people.<br>
<p>
I'd venture to say that any extropian who has ever tried to explain the<br>
philosophy to someone else has run across the same problem: most people<br>
consider Extropian principles ethically bankrupt, despite the fact that<br>
they are grounded in utilitarianism, rationality, and a firm commitment to<br>
life.  Some common reactions I've gotten:<br>
<p>
Boundless Expansion - Anybody who thinks we can go on expanding forever has<br>
no regard for the precious remaining resources available to us.  Self<br>
Transformation - Modifying the body is morally wrong.  Smart drugs are<br>
dangerous and unethical.  People ought not live forever.  (I get this last<br>
one a lot; that one really puts me in a bad mood.)  Dynamic Optimism -<br>
People are normally in favor of this one, until I tell them about the other<br>
principles, which is when they conclude that my optimism is based on<br>
ignorance. :( Intelligent Technology - What if our creations try to kill<br>
us?  Creation is reserved for God.  Intelligence is for human beings with<br>
souls only.  Spontaneous Order - Spontaneous Order is Social Darwinism,<br>
which is morally reprehensible because it has no regard for human dignity<br>
or equality.  We have a moral obligation to participate in government and<br>
to give away our resourses to those who need them more; libertarianism/<br>
anarchocapitalism denies this obligation and is therefore morally bankrupt.<br>
 Out of control technologies are dangerous.  And in general:  Sounds like<br>
science fiction.  You don't realize how delicate our ecosystem/economy/soul<br>
is.  Technology is the tool of the rich.<br>
<p>
Convincing people to accept extropy, IMHO, is actually far more difficult<br>
than eliminating world strife.  :/<br>
<p>
However, I have been kicking around a thought which might make an effective<br>
memetic trick...  It would involve justifying extropy in terms of<br>
Christianity.  While I think this might work memetically, I don't like the<br>
means by which it would work.  It would be much like the Church of Virus,<br>
only it would have one critical memetic tool which Virus neglected:<br>
assimilating with the mainstream.  Unlike the Church of Virus, Christianity<br>
based on extropy would pretend to be plain-vanilla Christ worship...  But<br>
it would have a twist.  It would emphasize the intricate relationship<br>
between God and complexity, God as the incomprehensible force of<br>
self-organization.  It would mandate extropy by affirming it in the name of<br>
Christ.  Christ was a rebel...  Methuselah lived hundreds of years... David<br>
slew Goliath with a sling, after all... You get the idea.<br>
