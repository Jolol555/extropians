Granted these days about 90% of what I read is SF, but I did just read<br>
Drew Carey's  book "Dirty Jokes and Beer", which though the first half<br>
is a light as any comedian's book, the second half is short stories that<br>
are rather dark and interesting. I just went through the Corel Ventura 7<br>
Official Guide, while dealing with multiple "known bugs" in the<br>
software, like frame anchors not staying where they are supposed to in<br>
my 1200 page publication.<br>
<p>
SF is the only place where I can find new ideas that someone isn't<br>
trying to bury under umpty million syllables of latin-ish scientificese.<br>
Why do highly skilled and specialized scientists insist on writing about<br>
their discoveries in nomenclature and acronyms that only someone also in<br>
their own highly specialized field would understand? No wonder there<br>
isn't much cross fertilization.<br>
