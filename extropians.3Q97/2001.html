"Heat", in modern thermodynamics, is used to refer to the thermic <br>
energy of a system.<br>
<p>
"Tempererature" is used to denote a parameter describing the thermal <br>
distribution function, roughly a measure of the mean kinetic energy. <br>
It is interesting to note, however, that even this updated notion <br>
of temprature is rather out of tune with contemporary science. In <br>
some contexts (e.g. in certain quantum descriptions of lasers) there <br>
is talk of systems with hotter than infinite temperatures, or of <br>
temperatures below zero Kelvin. It is a matter of debate whether this <br>
is a concept extension or whether a new concept has been introduced. <br>
In my opinion it may be unwise to expect a yes/no answer, because it <br>
seems all to be very much a matter of degrees and aspects.<br>
 <br>

<p>
Yes, many people mistakenly think that our intuitive notion of <br>
complexity is a uniform,  precise one. It isn't, only <br>
certain mathematical (related) concepts are, but these tend to be <br>
irrelevant except for mathematicians.<br>
<p>
On this list, people often seem to use the word "complexity" to <br>
mean:" system which I happen to find intellectually interesting". The <br>
people who do this then ususally assume without argument that the <br>
post-singularity future will be extremely complex in this sense. In <br>
my opinion, that is a possibility; but it is also very possible that <br>
it won't be, even if we assume that some form of highly intelligent <br>
life survives. We should be on our guard against possible biases that <br>
might make us inclined to believe in something just because it would <br>
be interesting it it were so. (Is this bias toward intellectual <br>
interestingness our equivalent to emotional biases more prominent in <br>
other groups?)<br>
