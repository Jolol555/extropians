There is 73 lb of a P-238 based ceramic compound on the RTG units. How<br>
much of that is actual plutonium isotope I don't know. The protesters<br>
disingenuously claim that the P-238 on board is "280 more radioactive<br>
than P-239, which is used in atomic weapons" (notice they don't say<br>
nuclear, apparently they've given up on using the word since you can<br>
never find one of them that can pronounce it correctly. ;)). What they<br>
fail to inform people is that P-238 emits alpha radiation while P-239<br>
emits gamma radiation, horses of entirely different colors. Alpha<br>
radiation is so weak that a sheet of paper is sufficient sheilding from<br>
it. So while P-238 emits 280 times more radiation "particles" than<br>
P-239, the difference in terms of safety, the environment and health<br>
risk is overwhelmingly the reverse. This compound has a melting point of<br>
1000 deg F, while a reentry caused by straying too close to the earth's<br>
atmosphere at almost 40,000 mph would raise surface temperatures above<br>
10,000 deg, which would obviously boil and burn the RTG into vapor. The<br>
casing, a high temperature compound that I forget the name of at the<br>
moment, has a melting point of 4500 degrees.<br>
<p>
I have yet to hear about what altitude the probe will be at at closest<br>
approach. Since they  protesters aren't saying, I assume its a couple<br>
thousand miles at the very least. Since this flyby maneuver is to<br>
accelerate the probe, not decellerate it, it obviously should be nowhere<br>
near the atmosphere.<br>
<p>
Considering that the average navigational accuracy for US interplanetary<br>
space probes is in the order of 1 mile per billion miles travel, the<br>
chance of the sort of disaster people are fearmongering about is<br>
ludicrously small. For this to happen, the probe must perform both Venus<br>
flybys flawlessly, then have its navigational systems fail as it reaches<br>
the halfway point between earth and venus. If this were to happen, we<br>
would obviously have several tens of millions of miles and several<br>
months to either overcome the problem, or shunt the probe off course so<br>
that it completely misses the earth-moon system.<br>
<p>
As an engineer, and looking at history, it is far more likely that the<br>
failure will be when it is launched on the Titan IV launcher. The reason<br>
protesters are focusing on the flyby for their propaganda is because<br>
such a disaster threatens potentially millions of people, while a launch<br>
failure would only threaten some fish in the Atlantic Ocean, and because<br>
they know that the RTGs have been specifically designed to survive<br>
launch failures (and have sucessfully done so in the past, to be<br>
refurbished and reused on a later mission).<br>
