<i>&gt;         &gt;If you don't care about dying, why even bother with uploading at</i><br>
all?<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                             </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think it's important to ask yourself exactly what is bad about death,  </i><br>
<i>&gt; personally I don't like death because it doesn't seem like much fun, it </i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't seem like much of anything. </i><br>
Right, death is (as far as we know, but I'd rather not find out for sure ;)<br>
the end of all imput/output and should be prevented. Does this mean we<br>
agree after all (on this bit)?? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Remember those old Twilight Zones when at </i><br>
<i>&gt; the end the hero is horrified to discover that he's really dead, even as</i><br>
a <br>
<i>&gt; kid I never understood that. </i><br>
Me neither. In fact, being a ghost or something almost looks like fun.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;You "know" you exist here and now, and that your memories are real  &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;and your own. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That is my working hypothesis but I don't "know" it to be true, and if</i><br>
I'm <br>
<i>&gt; wrong so what. It didn't bother me yesterday, why should it bother me </i><br>
<i>&gt; tomorrow?                   </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Why take this enormous risk with direct uploading when you can do      </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;the whole process gradually and without ever losing your &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;consciousness </i><br>
<i>&gt;                             </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, it's possible that fast uploading will destroy my consciousness &gt;</i><br>
while <br>
<i>&gt; doing it slowly will preserve it. It's also possible that slow uploading</i><br>
will <br>
<i>&gt; destroy my consciousness while doing it quickly preserve it. Both have &gt;</i><br>
equal probability of being correct, about the same chance as me being &gt; &gt;<br>
the only conscious being in the universe.<br>
<p>
IM(weakly scientific)O gradual uploading is the safest, because it <br>
allows more time for error correction, doesn't destroy the original brain <br>
and probably requires simpler (more complexity means more chances <br>
for a system failure, I belief)  technology. It's the cautious approach to <br>
a tricky problem, and could very well be the *only* way to "immortalize"<br>
yourself. <br>
<p>
I'd say the probability that (theoratically) gradual uploading works is<br>
90%, that instant uploading works about 5%, and the probability that *you*<br>
are<br>
the only conscious being in the universe is 0.0000000000000000000001%<br>
(btw, I always thought this too! Yep, I'm quite sure you're just something<br>
I made up ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So just what is it that the "original" (whatever that means) has that the</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "fake" does not, a soul?                                 </i><br>
No, it just isn't a continuation of yourself. It isn't you, just like a<br>
clone <br>
isn't you. It is strange how the same people that acknowledge that <br>
cloning is not a viable way to expand your lifespan, think that making an<br>
electronic copy of your brain structure is a good way to do it [extending<br>
your lifespan]. It's not, it's probably the very opposite: suicide.<br>
<p>
Quite simply, direct uploading is cloning of the mind. Nothing more,<br>
nothing less. And cloning is a lousy way to become immortal. <br>
