     To most people, and most dictionaries, 'sexual' means 'of or <br>
     concerning sex'. And sex does not mean making babies. I find it hard <br>
     to agree that heterosexual people having penetrative intercourse <br>
     without a condom are engaging in sexual activity, whilst those having <br>
     penetrative sex with a condom are not. "Making babies" is a subset of <br>
     sex, not vice-versa.<br>
     <br>
&lt;/quote&gt;<br>

    Rick, kindly cease from using provocative language: 'flame wars' are <br>
'not on' hereabouts; and when I 'flame' people, they _burn_.  OK?<br>

     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     A practical and sober response Sarah.  I'm of the mind that in this <br>
     particular instance, any other attempts to reason in this arena would <br>
     be like beating one's head against a brick wall &lt;G&gt;.<br>
     <br>
     I asked my partner about this whole teacher-lover-mother situation <br>
     with Mary Kay whoever.  He was actively pursued by a father figure man <br>
     when he was 13 and they had an affair.  It went on for the summer.  It <br>
     ended up being a big public court mess of course when the parents <br>
     found out.  The guy was in his late 20s and had used guilt and other <br>
     adult-honed forms of manipulation to make his boy-lover more mailable. <br>
     <br>
     Regardless of the information-richness of our society, the exceptions <br>
     we may deem appropriate or inappropriate in the realm of love/sex, <br>
     this woman was the boy's teacher, she was entrusted in a relationship <br>
     of propriety.  The boy would only naturally follow his impulses (like <br>
     boys his age will whether it's an unrequited crush or having one's <br>
     first hump or blow job in some private stolen moment).  I regard the <br>
     teacher (as does my partner) as an emotional child.  She has <br>
     sacrificed a great deal because of a howling error in judgment.  While <br>
     there may be volumes of extenuating circumstances Mr. Hollick can <br>
     dredge up to garner sympathy for the woman, fact of the matter is <br>
     doing what she did in our culture is no more appropriate than when <br>
     Ethiopian immigrants try to continue the tradition of female <br>
     "circumcision" in this country and think it's not a crime.  We as a <br>
     culture have deemed it so.  <br>
     <br>
     Until such time where children are somehow imbued with experience, <br>
     wisdom and discernment, they are not appropriate sexual partners for <br>
     adults.  The chasm is too wide (although considering the lame-brained <br>
     folly of Mary Kay, maybe they were closer, emotional maturity-wise, <br>
     than one may think! &lt;G&gt;).<br>

   Firstly, Rick (and others), visit the Rainbow Bridge Foundation  Home <br>
   Page.  Download the files held there for Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau's <br>
   case (I'm happy for them to be posted here, if that's OK with the <br>
   Extropian 'ListGods' hereabouts).  http;//www.agora.demon.co.uk<br>

  In a more nearly Extropian (or free) society, learning will be a <br>
  voluntary interaction between teacher and student.<br>
<p>
  The learner (of any age) may be issued with a book of vouchers, to <br>
  purchase the sought-for educational services from the teacher (of any <br>
  age).  We all understand the idea of honest exchanges for mutual <br>
  benefit, and the idea of the interaction of two (or more) intelligent <br>
  consciousnesses.<br>
<p>
<p>
  All parties to such relationships have _rights_.  This should be our <br>
  focus in the case of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau and her 'younger man.'<br>
<p>
<p>
  The 'younger man' is on record as saying that he actively sought a deep <br>
  relationship (he presented Mary Kay with a silver ring as a symbol of <br>
  his affection); and he is by all accounts an exceptional individual.<br>
<p>
<p>
  He and Mary Kay _love_ each other.  And now they have a child, Audrey.<br>
<p>
  They're both *magnificent* Americans.<br>
<p>
<p>
  "Why do we love where the lightning strikes, and not where we choose?"<br>
<p>
-- Coventry Patmore.<br>
<p>
<p>
   Mary Kay's father (John G. Schmitz) opposed 'sex education' in schools <br>
   during his political career.  Would an Extropian (or other <br>
   free-society) curriculum exclude or prohibit 'sex education'?  I rather <br>
   think not.<br>
<p>
<p>
  So the student, questing for educational services in the educational <br>
  'hypermarket', will seek out the best possible opportunities, and spend <br>
  his (or her) education vouchers accordingly.  Given the lack of <br>
  internal and external metrics for human experience and preferences, <br>
  most of us know better than to 'second-guess' the transactional choices <br>
  people make between themselves.<br>
<p>
<p>
   Are you saying you would seek to _coercively prevent_ competent <br>
   youngsters from seeking out and obtaining 'sex education'?  If this <br>
   freely develops into emotional and intellectual relationships, would <br>
   you seek to _coercively punish_ people for it?  Is it any of your <br>
   business. in fact?  Do you believe 'we' can arbitrarily declare love to <br>
   be some sort of 'crime'?<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
   "Yes" or "No" will do.<br>
