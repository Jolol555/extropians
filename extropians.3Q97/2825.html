<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; (And I'll never be able to figure out why</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone would choose something they don't want (the definition of evil)</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the first place, unless they are forced or some how prevented!)&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I decide that I want Brents computer, because it is better than</i><br>
<i>&gt; mine, there is no evil in me taking it. If Brent happens to object</i><br>
<i>&gt; to his (unwilling) act of brotherly love, because He worked long and</i><br>
<i>&gt; hard for his computer and can't afford to replace it, the evil must</i><br>
<i>&gt; be in Brent. I have just chosen something I want (Brents definition</i><br>
<i>&gt; of good).</i><br>

	No, you apparently simply haven't yet been taught...  Oh,<br>
sorry, if you could be taught then God should come down and teach you<br>
or else he would be evil for not doing so.  Or maybe you think such<br>
teaching would be "force"?  OK, Lets try again.  You apparently<br>
haven't yet learned, from your own experience, maybe from the examples<br>
of others, that it is much better to give than it is to receive.<br>
<p>
	You may THINK you want to steal my computer from me, simply<br>
because it is a better computer, but once you realize that it is<br>
better to give than to receive you will repent and change your ways.<br>
Once you learn this, you will finally have free agency, and finally be<br>
able to get what is better or what you really want.  Anything, such as<br>
mistaken ignorance like this, is destroying your agency because it<br>
prevents you from getting what you really want.  When you think you<br>
want something, but are mistaken, it forces or causes you to choose<br>
what you don't really want.  There is no need for it to be some<br>
damning "moral agency", I need not hate you for having such a desire,<br>
I need not give up faith that it will be possible for you to overcome<br>
this weakness, you are simply innocently mistaken and haven't yet<br>
learned a simple truth or achieved a certain moral character.<br>
<p>
	Just like thinking one wants to hope there is an all powerful<br>
God, when you think about things with a little more rigor and<br>
completeness, you realize that things aren't always what they first<br>
seem and what we think we want often isn't.  We are often tempted to<br>
think such simplistic things, but once we gain more intelligence, we<br>
can finally become much more free and finally get what we really want.<br>
Then and only then, can we finally be free.  And, when we are free,<br>
like God, we will always choose what is right.  Only when we can be<br>
guaranteed to reliably choose what is right, like God, can we finally<br>
be free and get what is best or what we most want.<br>
