conscripted by black holists, warped into yet another comical New Age<br>

Perhaps one can fall into the quantum mysticism trap just as easily<br>
through excessive reductionism as through the unhealthy holism you<br>
decry.<br>
<p>
Take, for example, the current trend by many to explain consciousness<br>
in terms of quantum ‘computing’ in the brain’s ‘microtubules’. <br>
Penrose and Hameroff may be best known in this regard.  There’s also<br>
psychiatrist Gordon Globus, author of _The Postmodern Brain_, who<br>
writes the following at<br>
<a href="http://www.zynet.co.uk/imprint/online/Qualia_globus7.html">http://www.zynet.co.uk/imprint/online/Qualia_globus7.html</a> :<br>

&lt;The sensory input flux comes in and is thought to be re-presented as<br>
Froehlich condensates. So we have a re-presentation of quantum reality<br>
(which is not world-like) as Froehlich condensates (which are not<br>
world- like). At the same time, there is *quantum cognition*, a<br>
superposition of continually changing expectations (possibilities)<br>
perhaps associated with the microtubules and the nanolevel web of<br>
filamentous protein. Quantum cognition is also not world-like but is a<br>
conjugate reality. This is, I believe, an original conjecture, so I<br>
shall emphasize it: *Cognition is conjugate reality.* In the continual<br>
interference between the stream of Froehlich condensates and conjugate<br>
cognition, observables appear. So the brain sustains quantum field<br>
interactions between a re-presentation of reality and cognitive<br>
conjugate possibilities, and an observable world with its various<br>
qualities unfolds in the match. &gt;<br>
<p>
Going down to this level and describing the mind, not to mention the<br>
rest of reality, in terms of "Bose-Einstein-like Froehlich condensates<br>
in quantum fields hoisted by brain biosubstrates, entering into<br>
quantum field interactions" seems to me to throw out, at least,  a lot<br>
of what we know from a higher-level perspective about physiology,<br>
geology, ecology, culture, etc. (even if it is somehow ‘algebraically<br>
equivalent’).<br>
<p>
Physics may not explain everything about organisms and physiology may<br>
not explain everything about psychology.  Epistemologies appropriate<br>
for explaining ‘things’ at one level may not be as applicable for<br>
explaining things at another level.  Middle-out approaches usually<br>
turn out to be more practical than strictly top-down or bottom-up<br>
approaches.<br>
