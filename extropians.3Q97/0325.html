<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Rockefeller did not have to lower his prices everywhere, only in</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;worked quite well to his advantage.</i><br>

<i>&gt;The only crime Microsoft and Intel have committed is in being  </i><br>
<i>&gt;successful, a peculiar sin for a Extropian. Imagine the screaming we </i><br>
<i>&gt;would hear if Apple had won and had "unfairly" crushed Microsoft. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Apple would not only be king of software but of hardware too.</i><br>
<p>
I only pick on 'successful' companies if they have gained their success <br>
in unscrupulous and anti-competitive ways, as Microsoft has.<br>
For sure Apple has made a bunch of crummie business mistakes.  Not least <br>
of which was refusing to allow clones to enter the market until <br>
recently.  Apple has been quite anti-competitive in its treatment of the <br>
clone vendors.  Thus Power Computing will start building Wintel <br>
machines. This in turn has caused Apple's stock to plummet.  Despite the <br>
fact that the Mac platform is great, Apple is getting exactly what they <br>
deserve.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;             </i><br>
<i>&gt;It's true that if you were starting from scratch lots of people could </i><br>
<i>&gt;make a more consistent, more elegant, system than Wintel, but </i><br>
<i>&gt;Microsoft and Intel didn't have that luxury. Everything they made had </i><br>
<i>&gt;to be compatible with everything they made before, this imposes a </i><br>
<i>&gt;severe burden, but a burden the most popular operating system in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;world MUST bear.  If everything else was equal they would be better </i><br>
<i>&gt;than Wintel  but everything else is not equal. These systems have </i><br>
<i>&gt;some small technical advantages but that is countered by enormous </i><br>
<i>&gt;practical disadvantages, they will not operate on the type  of </i><br>
<i>&gt;computer most people have and it will not run billions of dollars </i><br>
<i>&gt;worth of popular software that took thousands of man years to write. &gt; </i><br>
It's perfectly valid to take such things into account when deciding <br>
<i>&gt;what system is really superior. When a standard is set it's just not </i><br>
<i>&gt;worth going to a new one unless you get an astronomical improvement. </i><br>
<i>&gt;The market has decided that the Apple or Next or Bee is not a huge </i><br>
<i>&gt;advance of that type. Maybe the market is wrong but I know</i><br>
<i>&gt;it has a better understanding of such things than a bunch of hack </i><br>
<i>&gt;politicians.</i><br>
<p>
You make a very good point.  And if I were to buy a new computer today <br>
it would be Wintel for the exact reasons you specify.  My only <br>
contention, is they have become the de-facto standard by stifling <br>
progress on many other fronts.  So the way I see it, Free-Market <br>
Economics is not necessarily best for technological progress - at least <br>
in the short-term.<br>
