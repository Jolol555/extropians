They make take offense, but I would stand by my view that their belief is<br>
not in accordance with the evidence. Surely you are not suggesting that a<br>
Ph.D. in physics can rationally hold that "every word of the Old Testament<br>
is unvarnished and unmetaphorical fact"? The Earth is only a few thousand<br>
years old? God created Adam and Eve and there was no evolution. Such a<br>
physics Ph.D. would have a faith in both senses of the term -- a belief in<br>
a doctrine, and a belief insensitive to evidence.<br>

<p>
Eliezer, I'm not sure why you make this comment. Certainly I didn't say<br>
that all religious people are despicable! Not only did I not say that, I<br>
don't believe that. I don't event think that religions are entirely bad<br>
things, though I *do* think that faith in the sense of anti-rationalism is<br>
bad. <br>
<p>
I don't for a moment despise religious people even when I get email like<br>
this from Christians in response to my In Praise of the Devil:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;you are a shit man.fuck you</i><br>
(That one came today. A few days ago I got this one:)<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;fucking leash!!!!!  Get your head out of your pathetic shit-infested ass and</i><br>

<p>
Although I get a lot of mail like that I do not take the view of religion<br>
or religious people that you seem to imply I hold. While some people<br>
seriously abuse their religion to take out their personal pathologies on<br>
others, many people try to be as decent as they can within their religious<br>
framework. And most of these religious framewords contain something of<br>
value. I do find more of value in Hinduism and Buddhism than in<br>
Christianity, but even the latter can have a good effect by encouraging a<br>
loving attitude -- something that some of us could do with more of.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure that you meant to imply that I have these views and attitudes,<br>
Eliezer, but since you made these comments in response to my message it did<br>
seem that way.<br>
