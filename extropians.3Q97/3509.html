<p>
Who's puritanical around here? I hope to retire at 35, live in a hut on a <br>
tropical island and only do the things I want to for the rest of my life. Of <br>
course many others share that dream, the only difference is that with some<br>
luck I may actually achieve it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I had</i><br>

<p>
Personally I much prefer to slack off and pursue my own goals, and one of<br>
the benefits of planning my life carefully and working hard is that I can<br>
*do* these things. But the older I get and the more of my dreams I bring<br>
to fruition through my own hard work the more annoyed I am by people who<br>
wander through life expecting the world handed to them on a plate, or,<br>
worse, expect me to pay for them. These people had every opportunity that<br>
I had, but chose to 'have fun' rather than take them, because the<br>
alternative was 'hard work'. <br>
<p>
Last year I took six months off and backpacked around the world, which<br>
took a lot of hard work, both in raising the money and organising the<br>
trip; and climbing Mt Fuji was much harder work than any day I've spent in<br>
a factory or office. That was the value I gained from that hard work, and<br>
the virtue is that I actually achieved my dream rather than complain that<br>
it was just 'too hard'. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would have thought, being</i><br>

<i>&gt; *limitations* of hard work have. </i><br>
<p>
Yeeeeesssss... but I can see even more clearly the limitations of sitting<br>
on my ass and whining. I want to *do* things with my life rather than<br>
spend it watching TV or perpetually talking about the great things that<br>
I'll do *one day* if it's not too hard; that's *my* idea of fun. Hard work<br>
is the price I pay for following my dreams through. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would much rather spend my time transforming my self,</i><br>
<i>&gt; creating art and having fun. </i><br>
<p>
Hmm, I'm currently starting to put my first feature film together; do you<br>
imagine that I can do that without working hard? The only show I watch on<br>
TV these days is 'Babylon 5', which is only on our screens because of the<br>
many years of hard work the writer spent getting it there; should he have<br>
given up and 'had fun' instead? Should Dostoyevsky, Kafka or Orwell have<br>
just 'lightened up' rather than writing all those depressing novels?<br>
Would the world be a better place if Van Gogh spent his days 'watching <br>
TV, having sex and smoking pot' rather than destroying himself for his <br>
art? <br>
<p>
Can you point out *one* great work of art that didn't require a great deal <br>
of hard work? <br>
