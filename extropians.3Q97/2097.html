I had thought that my first posting regarding the conference would <br>
much more positive reflections (of which there were many), but I see <br>
that something must be cleared up first.<br>
<p>
I did not recuse myself from the gender seminar in hopes of making <br>
any sort of public statement.  It had more to do with the very <br>
serious ethical dilemma that emerged for me prior to the conference <br>
involving that particular panel, and I stayed out of the room out of <br>
respect for the other speakers, as I have not yet resolved that <br>
particular dilemma in my own mind.  I have never heard of people being <br>
called out of the audience to speak during a panel at any conference. <br>
It is my general understanding that if you want someone to speak at a <br>
conference, you put them on the panel.  I don't understand why I am now <br>
reading comments on this list implying that I did something impolitic by <br>
not having been in the room when someone brought up my name.  I would <br>
not have said much had I been in the room, as each session has <br>
limited time to accomplish its goals.<br>
<p>
I spent that particular period of time discussing cryonics with the <br>
Alcor folks, and I discussed my decision with only a few persons, and <br>
more to get their feedback on a specific idea to provide a new type <br>
of discussion space within Extropy.  I would prefer to continue <br>
to pursue that aspect, in the hope of improving all areas of <br>
discussion within Extropy.  <br>
