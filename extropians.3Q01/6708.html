</em><br>
<p>THis is the force initiation principle at work. We never hurt the afghan
<br>
people, in fact, we supported them in their fight against an oppressor
<br>
for ten years with hundreds of millions of dollars. They turn around and
<br>
allow a government like the Taliban to decide that we, their allies, are
<br>
the enemy. So, this is not a case of us just killing a people we have
<br>
never met, never had any beef with. We helped them, they turn around and
<br>
betray us and host a group on their soil that attacks us. In the muslim
<br>
world, if your house guest commits a crime against your neighbor, you
<br>
are responsible for that crime.
<br>
<p>This is also a responsibility issue. Many, if not most, muslim nations
<br>
tend to hold, to a greater or lesser degree, to the idea that attacks on
<br>
muslim nations by infidels are attacks on all, that allowing infidel
<br>
armies into muslim lands, even in defense of a muslim nation, is an
<br>
affront to Islam (this is the whole basis for bin Laden's arguments that
<br>
have gained credence among the common people of the muslim world). If
<br>
this is so, then it is up to muslim nations to be responsible for the
<br>
defense of muslim nations, AND for the policing of their own. The
<br>
Taliban, and bin Laden, exist because muslim nations around the world
<br>
allow them to exist. If they truly believe that western armies should
<br>
stay out of muslim nations, they should take care of this problem
<br>
themselves.
<br>
<p>I hope that plenty of muslims realize what they, in their collective
<br>
responsibility, have done to the world. Unfortunately, I doubt it. From
<br>
all experience, it seems they are quite enamored of the classic sort of
<br>
criminal rationalization: killing a hostage, and blaming the negotiator
<br>
&quot;see what you made me do?&quot;. This is a consistent excuse through Iran,
<br>
Lebanon, Iraq, and elsewhere. We don't give the muslim world what it
<br>
wants, so they go and destroy something or someone, and it's our fault.
<br>
<p>The claims by many of 'moral eqivalence' are bogus. Thousands of Iraqis
<br>
and Palestinians die every year because they refuse to stop committing
<br>
violence and ask peacefully for help. The violence that occurs in muslim
<br>
countries is their very own making. They claim Islam is a religion of
<br>
peace, yet the peace that they promote must be on their terms.
<br>
<p>The American people are not sadists. Anyone in the world who has ever
<br>
peacefully asked for help from the American people has always gotten it:
<br>
famines in africa, disasters in latin america, wars in europe and asia.
<br>
Sometimes it seems that if we are to be blamed for anything, it is to
<br>
care too much, sometimes, for ungrateful people. I don't believe this in
<br>
every case or even most cases, of course, and I think that our past
<br>
philanthropy is now coming back to help us in this time of need.
<br>
Britain, Japan, Germany, and dozens of other nations jumped immediately
<br>
to help us without being asked. Nations who have little to give are
<br>
still foursquare behind us.
<br>
<p>Nor do I think that we will go as far in prosecuting this 'war' as the
<br>
present jingoism would have us believe. Given past history, I predict
<br>
that the Taliban will be quickly defeated in the field and will hand
<br>
over the live or dead bodies of al Qaeda. We will impose some rules on
<br>
them for the treatment of their people, which they will promptly ignore
<br>
when we disembark from that part of the world too soon, because we will
<br>
not want to look like we are oppressing other  people too much. We may
<br>
get in a few more licks on Saddam, but he will stay around as well,
<br>
because when it comes down to it, there are too many Americans who
<br>
haven't got the guts to get the job done, and they continue to disguise
<br>
it as a dislike of 'killing innocencts', or of 'going too far'.
<br>
<p>The world will look much like it does now when we are done, and Bush
<br>
will lose reelection as well due to dissatisfaction with the result, and
<br>
terrorism will rise up again to attack us with even greater violence,
<br>
with nukes, biologicals, or chemical weapons. Our nation will lose all
<br>
trust of the citizenry, and we will devolve into a fascist camp of ever
<br>
more limited liberties. 
<br>
<p>Is this the sort of future you really want? I don't, but I'm already
<br>
hearing the whining from many who don't want to do what it takes to
<br>
finish the job and eliminate terrorism once and for all.
