Donor Withholds $60M for Research

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Netscape founder Jim Clark is withholding $60
<br>
million he pledged to build a biomedical research center at Stanford
<br>
University to protest President Bush's restrictions on stem cell
<br>
research and congressional attempts to ban human cloning.
<br>
<p>``Our country risks being thrown into a dark age of medical
<br>
research,'' Clark wrote in an opinion column in The New York Times on
<br>
Friday.
<br>
<p>Clark said he was suspending payment of the balance of $150 million
<br>
he pledged in 1999 because it would be futile for private funding to
<br>
supplant federal grants. He also cited recent decisions to limit
<br>
research to existing stem cell lines.
<br>
<p>``It now seems that creating genetically compatible new skin cells for
<br>
burn victims, pancreas cells for diabetics, nerve cells for those with
<br>
spinal cord injuries and many, many other potential advances will
<br>
soon be illegal in the United States,'' wrote Clark, a billionaire
<br>
who also founded Silicon Graphics, Healtheon and MyCFO.
<br>
<p>``Driven by ignorance, conservative thinking and fear of the unknown,
<br>
our political leaders have undertaken to make laws that suppress this
<br>
type of research.''
<br>
<p>Earlier this month, Bush announced a policy to limit federal funding
<br>
for medical research on embryonic stem cells. Bush, an abortion
<br>
opponent, said it was important to ``pay attention to the moral
<br>
concerns of the new frontier.''
<br>
<p>Stem cells are created by removing an inner cell mass from a 5- to
<br>
7-day-old embryo, a procedure that kills the embryo. When properly
<br>
nurtured, the cells are able to replicate, or divide, virtually
<br>
forever,
<br>
creating what is called a stem cell line.
<br>
<p>Clark was apparently also objecting to legislation passed by the
<br>
House of Representatives that would ban human cloning -- not just
<br>
cloning for reproductive ends but also so-called therapeutic cloning.
<br>
Such cloning would produce stem cells by creating embryos from the
<br>
cells of a single person, giving scientists an exact tissue match to
<br>
develop treatments for that person.
<br>
<p>Construction of the Stanford facility is already under way and
<br>
university officials said Friday that Clark's decision would not
<br>
affect
<br>
its 2003 completion target.
<br>
<p>Stanford President John Hennessy said the university was ``saddened''
<br>
by Clark's decision, though he also expressed concern that
<br>
restrictions on stem cell research and cloning could slow development
<br>
in disease treatments.
<br>
<p>The center will house projects that include efforts to grow healthy
<br>
organs from other tissues. Construction of the 225,000-square-foot
<br>
building, informally known as Bio-X, has been estimated to cost
<br>
around $200 million.
