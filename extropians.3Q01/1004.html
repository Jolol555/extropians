Mike,
<br>
<p>I'll admit that your description makes it sound like there's a research 
<br>
path that would lead to a deployable system.  My point was that it's far 
<br>
away, and selling us such a system now is sheer hype.  Your message 
<br>
reinforces my feeling.  You've convinced me that it is still several 5-10 
<br>
year research and development projects away.
<br>
<p>If it were something Microsoft or IBM wanted to do, I'd believe that they 
<br>
could plan, pay for, and manage several of these research projects in 
<br>
parallel.  But in the US government, such undertakings are vastly more 
<br>
political.  Getting reliable funding for any one of these for the life of 
<br>
the project is problematic.  Getting funding to work on integrating the 
<br>
systems doesn't even make sense until some of the systems work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The point of a defensive system is not to eliminate every missile that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets through, it is having a system that is good enough to eliminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough missiles that any actual damage done is not worth the cost of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the lost missiles.
</em><br>
<p>The point of a defensive system in a military theater is as you describe.  
<br>
The point of a population defense system against WoMD has to be to stop all 
<br>
or probably all incoming missiles.  If you stop 90% of 20 missiles, the 
<br>
threat has not been countered.  The technologies of the future will make it 
<br>
cheaper to deploy scores of copies of any weapon someone can test.  
<br>
Incoming missiles don't have to coordinate their actions.  A coalition of 
<br>
defensive systems do have to coordinate, and this is one of the hardest 
<br>
problems if you have to be close to %100 successful to be useful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hostile powers work on developing weapons of mass destruction because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are economical means of holding people hostage. Discouraging them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from engaging in such development simply requires making the return on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investment too high for reasonable use.
</em><br>
<p>A system in development that stops 20% in five years and 40% in 10 years 
<br>
and 60% in 15 years doesn't deter attacks on population.  It may serve to 
<br>
deter attacks on hardened military targets promising retaliation.  If we 
<br>
build hardened military targets promising retaliation, any enemies we have 
<br>
will notice that those tools can be used for offense as well as defense.
<br>
<p>I'd like to hear how developing a system like this promotes stability in 
<br>
the period in which it's an imperfect shield.
<br>
<p>Chris
