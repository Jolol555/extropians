Daniel said lots of stuff including:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; [I. Russell, wrote] Okay, I'm going to do my best to stay off this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thread...:/
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My best wasn't good enough, but, at least, let me rename the thread, so we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't have 2^n discussions going on at once under the same subject line.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I do have some familiarity with such accounts of property and I find 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unconvincing. Moreover, they are difficult to reconcile with the idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; property as understood by property lawyers. Without a detailed analysis 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these accounts, however, the fact that you find them convincing and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't is not conclusive one way or the other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How much familiarity, since you seem unaware that many of the issues you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bring up have been discussed before, especially in regard to civic duties,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;social responsibilities, and the limits to individual rights.  It's not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rand et al. ignored that stuff.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I'll stop here. I really do want to extricate myself from this thread 
<br>
which is looking like taking over my life at the moment and is not my 
<br>
highest priority, even on this list. I said that I'd go away and think about 
<br>
your citations etc and I will. And I wasn't been sarcastic in saying that I 
<br>
appreciated them. I respect your philosophical writing, what I've read of 
<br>
it, and I'll be happy to continue the dialogue with you in the future.
<br>
<p>However, just to be clear where I'm coming from, I am employed as a lawyer 
<br>
in one of Australia's most prestigious firms (though about to enter early, 
<br>
if possibly temporary, retirement!!) so perhaps I know *something* about the 
<br>
law &lt;g&gt;, though this is hardly conclusive evidence. I have extensive formal 
<br>
study under my belt in both law and philosophy, with *very* high grades, 
<br>
including first class honours results in both Property Law and Jurisprudence 
<br>
(ie philosophy of law). I have read extensively in these fields and more 
<br>
generally in political and ethical philosophy (as you'd know, the subject 
<br>
matters of jurisprudence and political philosophy are largely the same, or 
<br>
at least overlap very heavily). I have thought about the issues at great 
<br>
length over the years and sometimes with all too much earnestness.
<br>
<p>I have probably been too self-deprecating in some of my comments (but I 
<br>
don't claim to have all the answers).
<br>
<p>OTOH, all that does not mean that the issues relating to libertarianism etc 
<br>
are my very highest intellectual priority. They are not. Moreover, it's true 
<br>
that I'm not familiar with past discussions on this list. I've only been on 
<br>
the extropians list for a month or so. Perhaps I should go and look at the 
<br>
archives and not take the discussion any further until I've done so. 
<br>
However, I thought I was asking Jerry and the others reasonable questions 
<br>
about their political philosophies based on my knowledge of the subject. 
<br>
Also, it's a bit hard on newcomers if we can't express an opinion, however 
<br>
tentative, and however much we've studied the relevant issues from some 
<br>
other background or vantage point that we have, unless we've pored for hours 
<br>
over the wisdom in the archives.
<br>
<p><p>Russell
