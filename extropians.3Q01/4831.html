<p><em>&gt;How about antitruck defense? Antishipment defense? Anti UPS
</em><br>
<em>&gt;defense? If I put a nuke on board of my private Cessna with bona

<em>&gt;fide papers? If I rent an apartment in a skyscraper, and arrange
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the nuke to be delivered there disguised as a piece of office
</em><br>
<em>&gt;furniture?
</em><br>
<p>That was sarcasm on my part, besides it's clear that whoever wrote
<br>
that has absolutely no idea of our current anti-submarine defense,
<br>
nor will they get that from me, that was the former presidents
<br>
domain.
<br>
<p>As to if any of the other delivery systems will prove effective,
<br>
only time will tell.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If I don't bother with nukes at all, and just go biological, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you detect about 3 days after it has been synchronously deployed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in tens or hundreds of different locations, by virtue of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suddenly starting dropping like flies by the millions?
</em><br>
<p>Gee, if it's so easy why hasn't it happened yet. More sarcasm by
<br>
the way, you can't defend against every possible scenario.
<br>
Biological warfare is considerably more difficult than most people
<br>
believe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Of course they're different: you're going to use alternative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;delivery vehicles. I wouldn't risk the 10 nuclear devices I have,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I might lose several, thus weakening the impact. So I make sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the delivery will be accurate, and stealthy, and reliable. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other words, I will use a delivery truck.
</em><br>
<p>You continue to argue this point while continuing to ignore the
<br>
reasons why this is unlikely. Besides as I indicated it is not
<br>
possible to defend against every possibility.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;We've been through this before, the system will intercept only a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;small number of dumb vehicles. It will have trouble to intercept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meaningful numbers of smart vehicles. It is completely bypassed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other modes of delivery. It's 95% a purely political/economical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;piece.
</em><br>
<p>Your right, we've been through this before, the technology you
<br>
speak of is not in the hands of those the system is designed to
<br>
defend against, your other delivery modes are unproven as well.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I'm Russia, or China, and I just don't know how good your system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is. It cannot be tested in reality by means other than a full
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scale attack, so I'll just compensate it by developing NEMP
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weapons as show openers, smart vehicles, and MIRVed nukes, lots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them. Modern nukes designes as used by superpowers are tiny, cheap
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and clean.
</em><br>
<p>For about the fourth time, the system is not designed to defend
<br>
against a superpower. A large scale attack would be met with large
<br>
scale retaliation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As a result, we suddenly have more nukes in circulation. People
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be getting nervous again. Do you remember how it was growing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up, always expecting a flash out of clean blue sky? Do we need
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that again, honestly?
</em><br>
<p>I didn't grow up that way, but by the way it's going to happen
<br>
again anyway. China is going to develop a large scale nuclear
<br>
capability and we're right back where we were, honestly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &quot;MAD&quot; equilibrium disappeared with the fall of the USSR, and in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; case you weren't aware, China has superpower designs and is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; going
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to build its arsenal accordingly. When China starts refering to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Singapore as &quot;The Lost Colonies&quot; you'll understand.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I thought the umbrella was useless against a superpower. China is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pretty big, and it is growing fast, so it will be there quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;soon.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, stand by for MAD II.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I find your analysis faulty, no doubt the pentagon does as well.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I haven't yet heard a single convincing argument for the umbrella.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I've heard dozens convincing arguments against the umbrella.
</em><br>
<p>I feel pretty much the opposite, except I feel there are some good
<br>
arguments against.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that we should make every effort in this regard, however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only an idiot leaves himself/herself defenseless.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Why defenseless? If this is a small attack with ICBMs, you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forewarning, and you see them coming, so you just bring the folks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in target areas underground, and launch a retaliation strike.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Passive defense against openly deployed WOMDs is very possible,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and cost effective.
</em><br>
<p>18 minutes or so, less from a sub, and the cost of the underground
<br>
defense shelters you mention dwarves the cost of a missile defense
<br>
by several orders of magnitude, not to mention being completely
<br>
useless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Personal sterile seals, bunkers and pathogen aerosol sniffers are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not sexy, but they sure can be made to work, and will cost you a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fraction of an umbrella which won't work, and will invite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alternative modes of delivery which you're utterly defenseless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;again.
</em><br>
<p>underground shelters of the type you describe are far more
<br>
expensive and essentially useless.
