<br>
<p>&quot;I' ve been pondering some questions about the concept of singularity and
<br>
its meaning in transhumanist philosophy.
<br>
<p>Certainly the term is a bit difficult to trace sometimes, since it comes
<br>
from Teilhard de Chardins thoughts of the Omega- point (now that is a
<br>
shaaaky fellow, but more on TDC some other time) and also from the tiplerite
<br>
tradition, but I have seen also less &quot;mystical&quot; definitions of the term.
<br>
Also, not all of us think that a singularity is possible- but is it
<br>
desireable as a philosophical concept to be present in the discourse?
<br>
<p>I ask my self: isn't the concept of a singularity the last grasp of
<br>
Christian escathologism?
<br>
That the concept of an unlimited development became a far too great leap,
<br>
that you had to invent an end time?
<br>
A time after which progress would be so immense that discussion of it would
<br>
be pointless, often with the discussion falling down into an abstract
<br>
paradise.
<br>
But hasn't the introduction of escathology also introduced the concept of
<br>
immanentism in transhumanism, with all its perils?
<br>
Virtue is achieved through action, actions that may be very, very, very much
<br>
more complex than ours- but there is still action required to achieve
<br>
virtue.
<br>
The Omega- point seen as inert, thus it is not virtuous.
<br>
Thus the Omega point is not a state of Eudaimonia.
<br>
Could there also be a danger that the discourse about the concept of an
<br>
Omega point damages transhumanist philosophy today? Sometimes when I listen
<br>
to discussions about a possible Omega point I get very afraid.
<br>
It takes us out in very deep waters indeed, speaking about things we have
<br>
very little knowledge of.
<br>
An indeed unknown future, that is very far ahead, while neglecting the path
<br>
to it?
<br>
The truth is out there, but it is damned hard to reach.&quot;
<br>
I agree with Anders that you seem to run together the concepts of Omega
<br>
point and singularity--and the concept of singularity is often used
<br>
ambigously. But nevertheless, perhaps you might say something about how you
<br>
conceive of 'eudaimonia'. Obviously the content has been filled in by
<br>
eudamoniasts in radically different ways, from Aristotle to the contemporary
<br>
eudaimonist, A. MacIntrye. I see you often invoke the name of Aristotle, but
<br>
I wonder how you understand him. For example, in book 10 of the Nicomachean
<br>
Ethics Aristotle describes the highest type of human flourishing is that of
<br>
the man of wisdom (the philosopher) who thinks godlike thoughts. That is,
<br>
the highest type of human life consists in a convergence of our wisdom with
<br>
that of the divine, the unmoved mover familiar from the Metaphysics. The
<br>
philosophical life is attainable only be a few humans and indeed is
<br>
unintelligible to the mass of humanity, &quot;the many&quot;. That the philosophical
<br>
life will remain unknowable to the many certainly seems to have the same
<br>
epistemological slant as some understandings of the singularity. The unmoved
<br>
mover is not Christian, so so much for your &quot;companions in guilt&quot; argument.
<br>
Indeed, one might think of the unmoved mover as the country cousin of the
<br>
Omega point. Perhaps you could help by saying what you think the content of
<br>
&quot;human flourishing&quot; is. As Aristotle points out, there are many theories on
<br>
this, when people are poor they say it consists in having wealth, when they
<br>
are sick it consists in health, and so on. How do you concieve of the
<br>
relation between virtues and human flourishing? How should we invoke
<br>
Aristotle name if we give up what many commentators call his metaphysical
<br>
biology?
