<em>&gt; Just out of curiosity, I'm wondering how many on this list feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they came up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the idea of the singularity on their own. I feel like I did, and was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprised to find an organization based, in large part, on the concept.
</em><br>
<p>I believe H.G. Wells' Shape of Things to Come, Orwell's 1984, and similar
<br>
stories have predicted the basic concept of future-shock for a long time.
<br>
In the '70's there was a book called Future Shock.  People thought computers
<br>
would make life so complicated that we wouldn't be able to cope or
<br>
understand reality.  They predicted that the future would be so alien that
<br>
we would not be able to comprehend it or cope.  The entire world would be
<br>
transformed.
<br>
<p>I think historically, every generation has had this fear.  The industrial
<br>
revolution made people fear that machines would do all the work and humans
<br>
would either live in utopia or wander around dazed without any purpose of
<br>
function.  When the New World was discovered, it was an planetary reshaping
<br>
event that changed the view of the planet.  Entire geographies, cultures and
<br>
histories changed.  People suddenly could leave the known world and go
<br>
somewhere else.  This was seen as a bizarre change with a new world which
<br>
was assumed to be so alien that people wondered if it were possible to
<br>
colonize.  People feared the idea that the earth wasn't in the center of the
<br>
universe.  They thought that this concept plus other scientific discoveries
<br>
would rock the foundations of the cosmos so much that the common man would
<br>
be lost and unable to cope with reality.  Socrates was coerced into drinking
<br>
hemlock because his basic philosophical ideas and thoughts were feared to
<br>
corrupt a whole generation of youth with a culture so radically different
<br>
and changed that it threatened to bring down empires.
<br>
<p>I believe every generation believes that they are on the cutting edge of
<br>
some cataclysmic change.  They always imagine that they are possibly the
<br>
last generation and that the world would be destroyed soon.  The apocalypse
<br>
is always seen as immanent.  Each generations imagines that their
<br>
accomplishments piled on top of all historical accomplishments have
<br>
accelerated so far that there is no turning back.  They also have trouble
<br>
conceptualizing the changes such that they cannot fathom what future changes
<br>
will bring.  As such, they always predict total destruction or total
<br>
incomprehensibility of the future.  This is the basis of ancient religious
<br>
apocalyptic writings and mystical  revelations.
<br>
<p>There is nothing new in the concept that we will finally reach the ultimate
<br>
acceleration into infinity.  I think each generation looks like it is
<br>
advancing exponentially when compared to all previous generations.  What
<br>
looks like a steep exponential curve to us will be relatively flat to our
<br>
descendants.  I not only think that the concept of a singularity is an old
<br>
concept.  I think it is a recurring concept that will keep repeating.  We
<br>
will keep having continuous improvement into the future with no sudden
<br>
changes in reality.  We will adapt to sudden changes as we have adapted to
<br>
guns, steam engines, computers, space travel, internet, genetic engineering,
<br>
etc.  Cloning, uploading, and nanotechnology will merely be the latest
<br>
products on the market and will  soon become boring.  The riots and battles
<br>
over future technology will be just like past battles over slavery, race
<br>
riots, energy crisis, gay rights, nuclear energy, etc.
<br>
<p>In many ways, the more things change, the more they stay the same.
