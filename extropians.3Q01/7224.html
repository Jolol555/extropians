<em>&gt; &gt; However, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; time codes have been considered too inconvenient to be practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is now possible for someone to carry around a chip with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enough pre-recorded random bits in it to last longer than anyone can type.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is now possible for such a chip to be inserted under the skin (see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; RF
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ID stuff) and be accessed by a palm device
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wish the bad guys WOULD do something this simple.  We would easily be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to recover the chips from dead bodies and have a copy of the master code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (This is the classic probelm with &quot;infinite random&quot; codes.  If the recipient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a code-book, that code book can be stolen.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Louis, I was talking about one time codes.  The bits used for decryption are
<br>
gone after each message.  If you capture the device you, for sure, will not know
<br>
what was in the past messages, and if it has good access controls (Harvey talks
<br>
about this later on this thread) it may be very difficult to use it at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Steganography has value on more than one level.  Traditionally, it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; valuable (when it worked) to send messages without anyone knowing that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were sending messages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very rarely.  If the NSA are watching a known terrorist, and he transmits a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picture of a puppy-dog, do you really think they won't know there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message?
</em><br>
<p>When I used the term &quot;traditionally&quot; above I was talking about the many
<br>
centuries of history of steganography.  Read any history of cryptography book
<br>
for this stuff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If I publish a page of random numbers, I may also be sending a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; message, but you cannot prove that I am unless you can break it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  If you haul me into court and demand I supply you with a key,  I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are just numbers, and that there is no key
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I doubt it.  If you published a random page of numbers, everyone will ASSUME
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is a message.  It's just too bizarre to believe that someone published a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; random page of numbers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Quite common, actually.

<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Harvey has indicated that steganography alone is not useful,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you added the &quot;alone&quot; part.  Harvey was saying that steganography
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not add anything to encryption.  You might as well send encrypted text.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He was saying that embedding it in a picture buys you nothing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not quite.  He pointed out that embedding a pattern that can be detected by its
<br>
statistical structure does not hide its existence.  I naturally agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This combination can make it undetectable.  I can put a digital recording
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a poem reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on my web that sounds perfectly normal, and stands up to any statistical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; analysis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are just repeating yourself.  Multiple people have objected that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CAN'T make it undetectable.  Yet you keep repeating that you can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Steganography may hide a message, but if someone suspects that it does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contain a message, it will be OBVIOUS upon statistical analysis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>People have objected that you cannot guarantee that algorithmic encryption will
<br>
remain undetected because there is always the possibility that tomorrow someone
<br>
will discover a statistical test that gives a signature for some algorithm we
<br>
think looks pretty random today.  What I am talking about is using one time
<br>
codes based on actual random physics.  It is not detectable now, and will not be
<br>
detectable tomorrow either.
