</em><br>
<p>If we are to only look at bin Laden, and at the arab cultural concept of
<br>
family honor, it is evident that the current state, where the family has
<br>
disowned him but let him keep his inheritance, is really insufficient by
<br>
arab standards. They created this monster, it is their responsibility
<br>
(at least as much as ours) for letting him continue to live. The large
<br>
bin Laden family does do many good things around the world and is fully
<br>
engaged in the global economy (one owns property in Boston and another
<br>
group donated several million bucks to Harvard and other educational
<br>
institutions), but it seems to me that they have been rather remiss in
<br>
tending to their own closet.
<br>
<p>If an arab girl who is promiscuous must be killed by her father or
<br>
brothers, then what bin Laden has done mandates no less a debt of honor.
