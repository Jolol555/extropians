----- Original Message -----
<br>
From: &quot;Charles Hixson&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:charleshixsn@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Questions%20about%20the%20Singularity&In-Reply-To=&lt;005a01c13807$ea27fbe0$c8c8f418@southmount.com&gt;">charleshixsn@earthlink.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Notice that this doesn't really have anything to do with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity at all.
</em><br>
The connection is made on the supposition that after the singularity there
<br>
will exist beings that are cognitively enhanced compared to our present lot.
<br>
<em>&gt; And when the post-singularity beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appear, everyone will be post singularity.
</em><br>
What we need to suppose here is that there will be some cogntively enhanced
<br>
beings (posthumans) in the post-singularity world. Obviously all creatures
<br>
will be post singularity, even vermin and lice. What I am suggesting is that
<br>
not all creatures will have an enhanced intelligence--suppose some humans,
<br>
for example, choose for religious, ethical or other reasons not to enhance
<br>
their intelligence.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A similarity or two between a couple of processes isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient to call them the same, or even closely related.
</em><br>
My position is not that they are the same or closely related. Waldemar
<br>
Ingdahl maintains that they are antagonstic. I am a suggesting there may be
<br>
some overlap in their epistemological and ethical ramifications. But this is
<br>
not to assert an identity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sometimes it's sufficient to make a coarse grouping, e.g., live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vs. dead or unicellular vs. multicellular, but please notice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just how broad these categories are.  Oysters and Orangutans not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only are both multi-cellular, but both of them have names
</em><br>
<em>&gt; begining with O.  But there are perhaps as many differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between them as similarities (or perhaps not, but there sure are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of differences).
</em><br>
<p>Gee, thanks for the elementary lesson in metaphysics. And there I thought
<br>
Being was an undifferentiated unity. :)
