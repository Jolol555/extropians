<em>&gt; &gt; Occasionally people ask if I want to upload when it becomes possible, and

<em>&gt; &gt; the answer is no.  I want to enhance my mentality, but I don't want to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See this is what I was talking about when I reviewed the Final Fantasy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movie. Many people when you talk about living in a computer/simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have this idea that it will be some kind of cheesy unrealistic sim. When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in actuality it can be just as real as the &quot;real world&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>I don't claim it will be any less &quot;realistic&quot; than reality.  By the time 
<br>
people (or at least I) will be willing to move in, the resolution will be 
<br>
as good as you want.  But someone will  have to have made a choice about 
<br>
which moment in the lifetime of the rock to recreate, and at what rate to 
<br>
let it erode, if at all.  Different people will climb different mountains, 
<br>
and few of them will choose to climb with potentially fatal consequences 
<br>
enabled.  It will be a different sport.  I also climb at an indoor climbing 
<br>
gym.  It's a different sport.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realize you may be already living in a sim right now?
</em><br>
<p>I realize that it's possible that that is how this reality is implemented.  
<br>
At this point, I don't see any reason to lend more credence to that 
<br>
hypothesis than to the one that suggests that there's an omnipotent, 
<br>
omniscient being who doesn't interfere in our affairs very often.
<br>
<p><p>I should probably mention, in the context of recent discussions of 
<br>
filtering that I run my filters differently than most.  I have the list 
<br>
turned off, except for authors whose writings I've chosen to read.  I 
<br>
occasionally see a new name quoted in other people's replies, and decide I 
<br>
want to add that name to the list of people whose messages I see.  Your 
<br>
name wasn't on my list before, so I only saw your message in Mike Lorrey's 
<br>
reply.  I will add your name to my list.  If there was more to your message 
<br>
than the paragraph I quoted above, I'd appreciate it if you'd resend it.
<br>
<p>Sorry I missed the original.
