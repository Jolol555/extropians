<p>The other day I mentioned my devotion to Aaron Sorkin's astonishingly
<br>
effective TV drama THE WEST WING. We in Oz are behind, as usual, so the
<br>
season finale only just viewed here last night. I have to tell you, it made
<br>
my hair stand on end to see the good-guy Catholic Prez of the United States
<br>
standing in the nave of a mighty cathedral denouncing god as a feckless son
<br>
of a bitch. Granted, there was a slightly sentimental implied redemptive
<br>
retraction in the closing moments (God doesn't *cause* fatal car crashes,
<br>
so it's all right, there, there), but this ferocious and entirely justified
<br>
blasphemy on a major US TV series did my heart good, I have to tell you.
