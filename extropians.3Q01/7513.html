</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe providing clean uniforms, a shave and a haircut would help here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ooops, maybe not :-/
</em><br>
<p>I think so. Nothing transforms a soldier like a change of uniform. Send
<br>
the NA a hundred thousand sets of Desert Storm style BDUs and they'll
<br>
start thinking that they follow in such a martial tradition. If one
<br>
thing is true about Afghans, it is that they love their weapons, and
<br>
salivate at the chance to get new and better toys to play with. Frankly
<br>
I'm surprised that arms makers around the world have not been setting up
<br>
R&amp;D testing facilities for infantry level weaponry there prior to this
<br>
point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think strikes on the Taliban's remaining military assets: it's Sukhoi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fighters, Tu-54 and 55 tanks, etc would also help tip the tactical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; balance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tactical balance aside, showing downing of enemy fighters -- especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if accomplished by america's islamic allies, as televised during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gulf war -- would be a big ratings hit. Tu-54's and 55's are getting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little old and don't look anywhere near as formidable as our own M-1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tanks, thus perhaps not the most photogenic of targets.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the Russians transformed some of these, along with some T-64s
<br>
they also left behind, with reactive armor, so they look pretty military
<br>
with their chained together blocks of explosive armor plates jangling
<br>
along. Our M-1 series looks more like a Lamborghini, certainly, but
<br>
things that go boom turn people on no matter what their age.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I thought of something like this, but more along the lines of a bounty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on Taliban: $100 US for each rifle and Taliban head brought in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would be interesting to know the average cost per dead enemy soldier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the various wars of the 20th century. I think $100 may be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pittance, perhaps $1000/taliban head is doable. I dunno how well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bounty-induced killings would fare on the evening news, however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially if it looks iffy that this dead guy in a turban with a long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beard is actually an enemy combatant.
</em><br>
<p>Well, Afghanistan is supposed to be the poorest country in the world
<br>
these days (behind Bangladesh, if you can believe it). $100 is likely
<br>
equal to a years income for the average Aghani fighter. Offer too much
<br>
and you'll ruin the economy with excessive inflation.
