</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Anybody with 20 missiles that can reach the US is not some underworld
<br>
terrorist group. This requires resources of a rather large degree, in
<br>
fixed locations, with a fixed logistical infrastructure, and tens of
<br>
thousands of employees, with hundreds of thousands of dependents and
<br>
extraneous economic actors. Anyone with responsibility for such a large
<br>
entity is not going to behave so madly as to blindly strike out with
<br>
such a low success rate, nor is going to put their entire infrastructure
<br>
at risk of reprisal. If they can only afford 20 missiles, they certainly
<br>
cannot afford Anti-Ballistic systems of their own to protect their
<br>
entire infrastructure against attack.
<br>
<p>You have not considered the cost of a reprisal attack on the initiator
<br>
of such a first strike in your calculations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Chris, what makes you think even a country like Russia, which went broke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; once before trying to outspend us, could possibly succeed at the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; game?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We aren't playing that game anymore.  The current game has several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; players who have nuclear weapons and delivery systems, and no players
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who have effective defensive systems.  One of the players announces that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it intends to start to develop and deploy defensive systems that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start out not very effective against some currently possible attacks and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get better over time.  If any of the other players are worried about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intentions of the player developing defenses, they can invest in more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and better offensive tools and stay ahead of the other player's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defenses.  They don't have to be able to win a war in order for it to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valuable in some cases to be able to inflict losses.
</em><br>
<p>This would only work if all actors had similar force capability levels.
<br>
They do not. China is still a minor player, just getting into the game,
<br>
while Russia is in such bad shape they can field less than 80 of the
<br>
hundreds of nuclear submarines they once operated with impunity, and
<br>
they can afford to build no new subs. Their missiles are poorly
<br>
maintained by poorly paid or unpaid workers. Inteligence estimates are
<br>
that Russia has a total mission capability rate of between 10-20% of
<br>
their total force, most of which is being absorbed by the Chechnya
<br>
debacle and other minor internal matters... The dissolution of the
<br>
Soviet Union has multiplied the number of targets they need to aim their
<br>
missiles at (in the form of former Republics), and increased the fronts
<br>
from which attacks may come.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are many countries in the world that hate us or are afraid of us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand why you want to be safe from some missiles.  My claim is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that trying to get there gives some of the countries that are afraid of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us or that hate us a reason and an excuse for arming.  We can reduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some threats, but making that move may increase others.
</em><br>
<p>Those who hate and fear us most can least afford to arm to the levels
<br>
needed to overcome such a system. 
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it's possible that the threats that will be reduced are unlikely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be exercised (a suitcase nuke is easier than a single missile.)  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think the threats that may be increased in response to our actions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more worth avoiding.  I also think it's a lot of money that doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit us.
</em><br>
<p>As I've said, any country with a suitcase nuke capability which also
<br>
hates us enough to use them is already under heavy customs scrutiny as
<br>
well as heavy sigint dedication by the NSA et al.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Regarding the billions to deploy a partially effective system, most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of that money has already been spent.  The research and development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of *current* EKV, THAAD and PAC3 has already been spent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Building a few thousands of these and parking them somewhere is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the cheap part.  I dont see why not go ahead and do it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The money that's been spent is sunk costs.  It's water under the bridge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  How much do you think building a few thousand will cost?  How  much to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operate them over time?  How much to develop the next layer of systems?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I thought we had agreed that the current technology is not very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective, and we have to continue to spend money in order to keep up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the obvious counters to our first move.)
</em><br>
<p>No, we have not agreed this. The biggest obstacle, and expense, has been
<br>
development of the core systems to reliable rates of effectiveness. This
<br>
is achieved or is very near completion. Actually mass producing and
<br>
deploying them is actually rather cheap because of the high degree of
<br>
automation built into the system.
<br>
<p>Lets say we build and deploy 40 SBLs once they've been perfected. Do you
<br>
think that each SBL would exceed $1 billion in cost? I don't, and I'll
<br>
bet Spike thinks the same way, considering the biggest chunk, R&amp;D, is
<br>
already spent. So, $40 billion to build and deploy the SBL system alone.
<br>
They we institute the PAC-3 Aegis and THAAD systems, and the THEL ground
<br>
based laser system as well. This would provide a layered system for less
<br>
than a few hundred billion that would protect at a 90-100% effectiveness
<br>
level for attacks of 300-500 missiles. Assuming that other countries
<br>
institute MIRV systems again, this could be effective against attacks
<br>
involving 900-5,000 warheads (given MIRVs run from 3-10 warheads per
<br>
missile).
<br>
<p>The problem with decoy warheads is that in order for them to effectively
<br>
simulate actual warheads, they need to be of similar mass, shape, and
<br>
COG as actual warheads, in which case, you might as well use actual
<br>
warheads, and this limits the number of decoys carried by a missile to
<br>
whatever percentage of MIRVs the attacker wishes to install. In the
<br>
final analysis, decoys are dumb.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spike continued:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  If we do not defeat nukes, they will eventually defeat us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why do you believe this?  And what do you mean by &quot;defeat&quot;?  I thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we were talking about a system that for the next twenty years will only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let a few nuclear missiles through.  If we don't deploy SDI, then worst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case, a few missiles hit us.  (Why would anyone invest to build more if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first few are likely to get through?)  
</em><br>
<p>If we deploy, we raise the barrier to entry cost for agressors who wish
<br>
to attack us by a factor of ten to 100. Such increased cost commutes to
<br>
a significantly enhanced deterrence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we do deploy, then worst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case someone delivers a few suitcase nukes.  Or (their choice, not ours)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we get into a arms race and have to spend lots of money trying to defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against more and more sophisticated missiles.  How did we benefit from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starting the race?
</em><br>
<p>Just as we benefitted from starting the whole SDI thing: we force
<br>
agressors to try to outspend us while maintaining oppressive
<br>
political/economic systems, which I think everybody will agree has been
<br>
proven to not be possible by the example of the USSR. War is about
<br>
spending the least amount to do the most damage to the other guys
<br>
ability to spend money on their own ability to do damage to you. SDI
<br>
vastly increases the barrier to entry cost in a world where ballistic
<br>
missile and nuclear technology costs have dropped. Countries practice
<br>
the diplomacy they can afford. Making nuclear brinksmanship
<br>
prohibitively expensive keeps countries calculating by factors that
<br>
benefit our security. Given that our aims are for a peaceful world, our
<br>
security is the world's security.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm more willing to believe that most of the people that might decide to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; join us in an arms race (if we start one) would also be willing to join
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us in a world wide market for developing and delivering high tech toys.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd rather be in a commercial race than an arms race.
</em><br>
<p>So would I. Reak your Locke before you decide.
