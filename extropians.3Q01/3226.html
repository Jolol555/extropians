<p><em>&gt;&gt;Transhumanism is a minor variant on an ancient theme. Plato and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Aristotle said the (1) telos of humanity's best (i.e., philosophers) is
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; become godlike, (2) that we ought to become godlike, and (3) that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dialectical reasoning is the means for philosophers to realize their
</em><br>
telos.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Unlike Plato and Aristotle (Hegel, etc.) we do not believe that there is
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; little divine element in us that needs to be nurtured. Darwin killed
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; idea forever. So, transhumanists substitute technology (most notably
</em><br>
genetic
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; engineering and AI) for (3). What separates us from Plato et al is a
</em><br>
minor
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; quibble about the means to become what we ought to be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry, but I respectfully and completely disagree. Our current concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the singularity is grounded in science, not philosophy. It is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple forward extrapolation of well-understood phenomena.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Since we disagree completely (but respectfully) let us take this in stages.
<br>
Let's work on the concept of transhumanism first, and then worry about the
<br>
connection (if any) with a singularity. The understanding I offered above of
<br>
transhumanism has a teleological and an ethical component. Perhaps we
<br>
disagree on this. Your post emphasizes the predictive nature of science.
<br>
Perhaps your understanding of transhumanism is similar to Robin Hansons:
<br>
<p>&quot;Transhumanism is the idea that new technologies are likely to change the
<br>
world so much in the next century or two that our descendants will in many
<br>
ways no longer be &quot;human.&quot; &quot;
<br>
<p>(This quote is from Ander's site). This definition seems more in line with
<br>
your comments than the one I offered. For myself, I not sure how
<br>
enlightening it is to concentrate simply on the likelihood of various future
<br>
histories. Suppose some Joyians (followers of Bill Joy) think that it is
<br>
very likely that our descendants may no longer be human, but see this as a
<br>
terrible catastrophe. Even though they understand that there is an extremely
<br>
low probability of stopping these changes, nevertheless they valiantly
<br>
struggle to stop the march of technology. On the other hand, suppose that
<br>
there are some that think that we ought to use technology to perfect
<br>
ourselves even though they think there is a low probabilty that we will do
<br>
so. (Perhaps because they think that the disparate elements of society that
<br>
are afraid of such changes will galvanize in opposition making progress
<br>
impossible). Nevertheless, these heroic souls bravely struggle for &quot;the
<br>
cause&quot;. It seems to me that the latter are the transhumanists, not the
<br>
former, even though they make rather bleak predictions. In other words, it
<br>
is the ethical imperative that seems to me to be more central to the concept
<br>
of transhumanism, as opposed to any predictions (short of certainty) about
<br>
the likelihood of various future histories. Mark
