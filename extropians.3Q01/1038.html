&quot;Embryo screening  known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis, or PGD  is
<br>
a gift from God, the Berkowitzes say.&quot; 
<br>
<p>I've been thinking about this technique, in its various guises, as a
<br>
possible way around the objections of those who wish to prevent use of
<br>
embryonic stem cells if their harvesting requires the destruction of early
<br>
embryos. While I regard this objection as drastically misplaced--as
<br>
fundamentally wrong-headed as trying to close down astronomical
<br>
observatories because the constellations are not in the right place
<br>
according to ancient sacred astrological revelations--still I figure it
<br>
would make sense to work around these qualms if that's technically feasible.
<br>
<p>Hence it strikes me that when an early in vitro embryo is screened for,
<br>
say, the genes conducing to myotonic dystrophy, some stem cells might be
<br>
taken at the same time and grown into an immortal feedstock. Loss of a few
<br>
undifferentiated or barely differentiated stem cells from a blastocyte
<br>
doesn't do the potential foetus any harm, and the process could be regarded
<br>
as no more wicked or injurious than trimming fingernails, let alone
<br>
discarding an entire placenta at birth.
<br>
<p>Anyone know of medical/biological objections to this proposed method? It
<br>
need not be restricted to interventions where a blastocyte is being
<br>
screened for deleterious alleles with a view to possible abortion (I don't
<br>
suppose anyone would wish to be injected with stem cells from a corrupted
<br>
DNA line in any case). Many healthy early embryos are compiled in vitro.
<br>
Unless there was a risk of damage, perhaps infertile would-be parents could
<br>
be charged a lower fee for the expensive procedure in exchange for some
<br>
stem cells from their early embryo? I suppose accusations of murder might
<br>
then be replaced with one of human-life-as-chattel, but I don't think
<br>
there's any law or moral stricture against selling your hair or even your
<br>
child's hair.
