Yes that is what I took you to mean. The first model seems to fit more
<br>
naturally with a genetic or in utero explanation for the Flynn effect.  I
<br>
was assuming in my original post that the first was the correct model. As I
<br>
noted, this has some support from the fact of increasing brain volume of
<br>
babies each year, coupled with the correlation (about .4) between brain
<br>
volume and IQ. Of coure the data here are fuzzy given that we have so few
<br>
good longitudinal studies of a person's IQ over a lifetime. And of course
<br>
this problem is confounded by the fact that the studies we do have, have
<br>
been done during the period which the Flynn effect is in operation.

<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, but the areas in which the young are the most resistant to the

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the old are the areas where knowledge should transfer the best:

love,
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reliability,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that it is possible in principle for the world to change so fast

</em><br>
My position is not that the knowledge of the old is irrelevant. The original
<br>
post lamented that the young do not listen to the advice of the old. In
<br>
response you wrote:
<br>
&quot;If people on average learn things as they grow older, older people will on
<br>
average
<br>
know more than younger people.&quot;I responded with the observation that even if
<br>
we grant the relationship between age and knowledge which you suggest, the
<br>
fact that the young do not listen to the old _might_ be justified by the
<br>
fact that the value of older people's knowledge might not on average be
<br>
greater than that of the young. It would be sufficient to make this the case
<br>
that _some_ of the knowledge of the old is irrelevant, or that the value of
<br>
old folks knowledge (on average) is less valued because they lack knowledge
<br>
of some key recent developments--e.g., marriage couseling services or the
<br>
possibility of joint custody of kids, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;... Perhaps you'll agree that these are ultimately empirical questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, since it is logically possible that you are right,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I must remain open to being show so empirically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Sorry, I should have formulated this more carefully. What I meant is that I
<br>
do not think that the empirical evidence so overwhelmingly favors one view
<br>
or the other such that it can be decided in an armchair.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You suggested that the young might solicit advice from the old in the
<br>
following areas:
<br>
&quot;love, marriage, friends, children, careers, work ethic, institutional
<br>
reliability.&quot;
<br>
I just conducted a well-controled superscientific study which involved
<br>
thinking about who among my personal acquaintances I would seek advice from
<br>
about each of these areas. I forced myself to come up with a different name
<br>
in each case. The average age of the seven individuals I have in mind is 47.
<br>
If my results are typical then the value of one's knowledge might peak well
<br>
before one's total knowledge peaks. But then again, I could be wrong.
<br>
Mark.
