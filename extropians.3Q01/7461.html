<p>Well, every person has a preferred speaking style. If you have a
<br>
speechwriter (and Bush is certainly not the first to have such, Clinton
<br>
had four to six on staff at any one time), it is best if they write
<br>
speeches in the style that is most comfortable to your own speaking
<br>
style.
<br>
<p>Dubya is not a flowery or complex speaker. He doesn't philosophize or go
<br>
on melodramatic soliloquys. He has a particularly straightforward,
<br>
declarative method of speaking, and one can see that he generally will
<br>
trip over convoluted compound sentences, especially if he didn't write
<br>
them himself. WHile this does lend him to satirizing with 'See Dick
<br>
run.' parodies, it doesn't make him dumb either. We can't all be
<br>
shakespearian types, nor, as the last president shows, does such skill
<br>
make one a particularly good leader.
<br>
<p>In the case at hand, he spent many hours with his preferred speechwriter
<br>
in developing this speech.
