</em><br>
<p>Ok, let's pave the U.S.  Most adults in this country support the
<br>
War on Drugs, which besides being responsible for government
<br>
terrorism against hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens, is directly
<br>
responsbile for terrorism and death squads in Columbia and elsewhere
<br>
and shooting down civilian planes in Peru, not to mention providing
<br>
a bountiful funding source for crimnals, terrorists, and rogue
<br>
states the world over, including the Taliban and Bin Laden.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 	As for the children they are not responsible, but still dangerous.

<em>&gt; Unfortunately, we learned this lesson many times before. We’ve all heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the Vietnamese children, trained to kill or those that had bombs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strapped on them that walked into G.I. camps. We saw on television these

<em>&gt; their AK-47s, grenade launchers, and stinger missiles (amazing supplied from
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the very ones over here dropping nerve gas, killing your children. Remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then, that now we had a chance to stop them, but you stepped in and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevented it. Who will we blame then?
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, we've learned that American kids can become cops and DEA
<br>
agents.  After indoctrination in our public schools they aren't
<br>
going to grow up to be lovers of freedom.  Let's kill 'em all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 	This is a war of ideas, capitalism and reason vs. religion and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrationalism.
</em><br>
<p>Bullshit.  If that was the case, the terrorists would've targeted
<br>
a less religious country, of which there are many.  Bin Laden and
<br>
his ilk don't give a dime about our ideological struggles.  Like
<br>
terrorists the world over, including factions in Northern Ireland,
<br>
Basque regions, Tamil parts of Sri Lanka, Chechnya, etc., etc.,
<br>
they have much more specific concerns.
