<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not believe that the market economy by itself is doing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; sufficiently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do you mean to imply that some re-distributive scheme could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have been better applied in recent decades?  If not, you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; certainly making it sound that way.  It definitely sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as though you have a better idea, at least for the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mean that I am gradually coming to believe that something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a guaranteed income is logical and necessary.
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;market economy&quot; doesn't perform well because it's messed with by any
<br>
number of legislative entities who have no real idea as to what the final
<br>
results will be. If it was left alone, most of the horrible messes you see
<br>
resulting from &quot;market conditions&quot; (really &quot;interference conditions&quot;)
<br>
wouldn't be happening.
<br>
<p>But on to the point I was going to make: why is it a good idea to sabotage
<br>
and bypass the primary motivations for people or segments of society to
<br>
improve themselves by creating a system in which there is little incentive
<br>
to improve? Raw capitalism may not be a bed of roses, but it certainly syncs
<br>
with ape nature, minimal cost of implementation, and inclining the most
<br>
people to create the most improvements to quality of life.
<br>
<p>If there's no risk, if a larger effort has to be made to rise above the
<br>
masses (i.e. above that guaranteed income), then whole sections of humanity
<br>
will fall in on themselves. Look at France over the last 10 years if you
<br>
want an example. Guarantee income, you guarantee teaching people to fail
<br>
rather than to strive and improve.
<br>
<p>Rights are a figment of the imagination, a consensual hallucination. The
<br>
more rights a society decides to create, the less fit the members of that
<br>
society become.
<br>
<p>So:
<br>
<p>altruistic -- moving away from pure capitalism doesn't encourage the growth
<br>
of fine human beings.
<br>
selfish -- by screwing up all these people, you're slowing down
<br>
technological growth and thus shortening your own life.
