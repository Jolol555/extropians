</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;but you have no information about the percent chance of any individual

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike is using subjective probabilites. That is, given a completely random black man, without further information, Mike *belives* that that man has 10% probaility of commiting crime. This would be subjectively correct. But extremely lazy. Further informa
</em><br>
tion might reveal that the man's wearing a suit and tie and titles himself as an accountant. Computing the fraction of criminal accountants compared to the total number of accountants might give the probability that this particular man being criminal is 0
<br>
.2% 
<br>
<p>This is exactly correct, and exactly what I said. But then again, seeing
<br>
the person wearing a suit and tie, you are only guessing that the person
<br>
is an accountant. If you are in a bad neighborhood, a black man in suit
<br>
and tie is just as likely to be the neighborhood cocaine dealer. I'd
<br>
expect a black accountant to live in a nicer neighborhood.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (In Mikes opinion of course, the man himself, having a sawn-off shotgun in his suitcase, about to rob the nearest bank knows otherwise).
</em><br>
<p>Very funny, though definitely possible. Since even I will acknowledge
<br>
that we don't JUST judge a person by their color, but by their clothes
<br>
and the car they drive, the surroundings, time of day, the look on their
<br>
face, their mannerisms, and relative physical size compared to
<br>
ourselves, and whether there are other people (and what sort of people
<br>
they appear to be as well) around.... and so on, the race and gender of
<br>
an individual are merely two individual factors in a sea of factors that
<br>
we evaluate in every encounter with other people.
<br>
<p>Giving increased weight to the persons race in excess of the proper
<br>
value of that factor in a trust rating of the individual is generally
<br>
unethical, but given that physical appearance factors are the most
<br>
noticable ones, they are guaranteed to be given greater than proper
<br>
weight in ANY valuation by any individual in any situation. It is part
<br>
of the Bayesian process of actors attempting to operate as if they have
<br>
all information when in fact they do not.
<br>
<p>Discrimination and racism can therefore be said to be effects of people
<br>
trying to act in a Bayesian manner when they are severly lacking in
<br>
information necessary to properly conclude a Bayesian transaction.
