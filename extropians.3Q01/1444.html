</em><br>
<p>The first flaw in your argument is your assumption that the conditions
<br>
in the Phillipines are the result of capitalism. They are not. The
<br>
Phillipinos may operate in a capitalistic manner, but the degree of
<br>
freedom individuals have there is a direct consequence of their
<br>
government, NOT their economy. The pattern in the Phillipines
<br>
politically is very similar to the pattern in many other countries
<br>
colonized by Spain, thus is indicative of the political culture fostered
<br>
by Spanish feudalism, and therefore, is not, by definition, a
<br>
capitalistic system. Feudalism uses a form of patron/client peony, and
<br>
not free market capitalism. 
<br>
<p>As a result of this, your conclusions about capitalism based upon what
<br>
someone has told you about the Phillipines are entirely basless.
