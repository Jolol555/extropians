<p><em>&gt; Actually, a .30-06 semi-auto is probably just about right for those stuck in

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Will they still do this, under wartime conditions?  Could we not
<br>
contact the DoA and implore them not to panic the proletariat
<br>
in this way, and risk a tragedy from said panicked proles?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The hard part is learning to shoot down an aircraft with a rifle, since
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I assume one would lead the target similar to the way one leads
<br>
a bird when hunting with a shotgun.  Of course, the muzzle velocity
<br>
of a 30.06 is probably about twice that of Mr. Twelve Gauge,
<br>
but the target is farther away.  Im estimating the muzzle velocity
<br>
of a 30.06 at about 600 meters per second, and a crop duster
<br>
up to no good would be about that  altitude or less, so estimate
<br>
its velocity at about 50 meters per second and lead the target
<br>
by about that much.
<br>
<p>I figure unpracticed proles would have about a one in 200 chance
<br>
of a hit per shot, and of the hits one in 10 would be one that has
<br>
a chance of ending the terrorist's fun.  So a few hundred proles
<br>
in a burb the size of this one with 10 round magazines should be
<br>
sufficient to bring it down before the Air Force arrives.  spike
