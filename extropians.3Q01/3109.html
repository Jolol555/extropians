Eric quoted/said
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But doesn't the good ol' Enlightenment liberal framework deal with a lot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this stuff about social disagreement?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do you have a URL showing exactly where they deal with this problem that I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pointed out in the paradox? I don't think I had read anything about this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yet.
</em><br>
<p><p>I've been pondering this. Like Lee, I'm not sure that there really is a 
<br>
paradox. However, the paradoxes of liberalism and democracy are well known, 
<br>
and I think you're talking about something similar. A couple of days ago, 
<br>
Reason and others were talking about a paradox of libertarianism, if I 
<br>
understood correctly.
<br>
<p>I actually think you're going to have to master the basics of political 
<br>
philosophy. &quot;Master the basics&quot; sounds like an oxymoron, but I mean that 
<br>
you'll have to get a thorough knowledge of the basic texts and ideas, before 
<br>
moving on to real mastery of the field.
<br>
<p>You may have done some of the work already - I don't want to patronise you 
<br>
by assuming otherwise. However, there's a limit to what you'll have been 
<br>
able to doso far at 18. If you don't know well the material I'm about to 
<br>
discuss, I don't think there's a particular URL that can help you. You've 
<br>
got to read some books and think hard about them. I'd say that you should 
<br>
start with the following:
<br>
<p>John Stuart Mill - _On Liberty_
<br>
<p>Karl Popper - _The Open Society and its Enemies_
<br>
<p>H.L.A. Hart - _Law, Liberty and Morality_ (I think this is the title, there 
<br>
are various books with similar titles by Hart and his opponents)
<br>
<p>John Rawls - _A Theory of Justice_
<br>
<p>Robert Nozick - _Anarchy, State and Utopia_ (the last chapter should be very 
<br>
interesting to you).
<br>
<p><p>The citations and bibliographies in these will take you deep into the 
<br>
subject.
<br>
<p>However, the most recent of these books, Nozick's, was published a quarter 
<br>
of a century ago. Okay, so you need some more recent reading. If you do some 
<br>
library searches and internet searches for material *about* these thinkers 
<br>
you'll quickly find other thinkers who are useful to you. Joseph Raz is one 
<br>
you must watch out for.
<br>
<p>There's also a vast field of imaginative utopian literature that you should 
<br>
absorb. Some good books in recent decades that I think you should try are 
<br>
Samuel R. Delany's _Triton_ and Greg Egan's _Distress_. Maybe also Kim 
<br>
Stanley Robinson's _Mars_ trilogy. And see the critical writing *about* 
<br>
these books in journals such as _Foundation_ or _The New York Review of 
<br>
Science Fiction_, which will suggest other such books. Tom Moylan is a 
<br>
writer who has written a lot about science fiction utopias, though he's far 
<br>
too socialist for my liking!
<br>
<p>All this will take you a year of solid work, I'm afraid, but it's a year 
<br>
that will stand you in very good stead for the rest of your (hopefully, long 
<br>
and free) life if you want to be able to discuss such issues seriously and 
<br>
be taken seriously.
<br>
<p>On bioethics, which is where a lot of this discussion started, have a good 
<br>
look at Max Charlesworth's little book _Bioethics in a Liberal Society_. You 
<br>
can follow his citations, once again, and it's a fairly recent book.
<br>
<p>Most of this material will be available easily in good book shops anywhere 
<br>
in the world. In any event, the University of Singapore is a major 
<br>
world-class university. I'm sure you could do well by spending time in its 
<br>
library with the above clues.
<br>
<p>Other suggestions: have a look at the web sites for Max More, Greg Burch and 
<br>
Daniel Ust. These contain interesting papers and reading suggestions.
<br>
<p>Finally, if you find you have ideas in advance of all those you find this 
<br>
way, that's great &lt;g&gt;! But the density and sophistication of your ideas will 
<br>
certainly improve and you'll impress people more when you can talk 
<br>
confidently about Nozick, Rawls, Popper, etc.  ;)
<br>
<p>Also, if you ever get a chance to study this stuff formally at university, 
<br>
take it. No matter how much you know, the discipline of working with 
<br>
teachers and fellow students always helps clarify and develop your thoughts.
<br>
<p>Best wishes
<br>
<p>Russell
