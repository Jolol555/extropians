The Math Gene  pp. 27-31 &quot;The Rise and Fall of Piaget&quot;, by Keith Devlin:
<br>
<p>Much of our current popular wisdom about small children's mental
<br>
abilities originates in the work of the cognitive psychologist Jean
<br>
Piaget fifty years ago.  Piaget's influence can be found not only in
<br>
many of our current beliefs about the way children learn, but also in
<br>
our educational systems. Unfortunately, as often happens with
<br>
ground-braking research, subsequent investigations have show that many
<br>
of Piaget's conclusions were almost certainly wrong. (I say &quot;almost
<br>
certainly&quot; because some psychologists still maintain that Piaget was
<br>
right, and that the experimental results I shall describe admit
<br>
alternative conclusions.)
<br>
<p>In the 1940s and I950s, Piaget developed a &quot;constructivist&quot; view of
<br>
child development. According to this view, a newborn baby enters the
<br>
world with a cognitive clean slate and, by observing the world around
<br>
it, gradually pieces together a coherent and steadily increasing
<br>
understanding of that world. In other words, the child constructs a
<br>
mental model or conceptualization of the world.
<br>
<p>Piaget did not arrive at his conclusions by armchair speculation. He
<br>
was an experimentalist, and his experiments are one reason why his work
<br>
was so influential.. It took great ingenuity and equipment not
<br>
available in Piaget's time for subsequent generations to devise more
<br>
reliable experiments. Whcn they did so, they reached very different
<br>
conclusions.
<br>
<p>For example, according to Piaget, children younger than ten months old
<br>
have no proper sense of physical objects as things that endure in the
<br>
world. Piaget based this conclusion on his observation that, when an
<br>
object such as a toy is hidden under a cloth, a baby ten months old or
<br>
younger will fail to reach for it. According to Piaget, &quot;object
<br>
permanency,&quot; as he called it, is not innate but is acquired sometime
<br>
after ten months of age.
<br>
<p>Similarly, Piaget believed that children do not have a number sense
<br>
until they acquire it at around four or five years of age. In one of
<br>
Piaget's experiments, repeated many times by different groups, a
<br>
psychologist would show a four-year-old child two equally spaced rows
<br>
of six glasses and six bottles and ask whether there were more glasses
<br>
or more bottles. The child invariably answered that there were the same
<br>
number. Presumably the child observed a one-to-one correspondence
<br>
between the l rows. The experimenter then spread out the glasses to
<br>
form a longer row l and asked the child again whether there were more
<br>
glasses or more bot-l ties. Now the child would answer that there were
<br>
more glasses, apparently l misled by the longer length of that row.
<br>
&quot;Obviously,&quot; Piaget concluded, l &quot;this shows that the child does not
<br>
have a properly developed number sense.&quot; In particular, Piaget claimed,
<br>
four- and five-year-old children have not yet grasped the idea of
<br>
number conservation: the notion that rearranging the objects in a
<br>
collection does not change their number.
<br>
<p>At the time, Piaget's experiments were held up as triumphs of
<br>
experimental science in psychology. As a pioneer, Piaget was blazing a
<br>
trail for future generations. And that is good science. Unfortunately,
<br>
his methods had serious flaws. He relied on the motor actions of the
<br>
babies in the object permanency test and on a dialogue between the
<br>
experimenter and the subject for the various number tests performed on
<br>
older children.
<br>
<p>In the case of object permanency, a baby's failure to reach for an
<br>
object hidden under a blanket does not support the rather dramatic
<br>
conclusion that the baby thinks the object has ceased to exist. Perhaps
<br>
he simply does not yet have sufficient hand-arm coordination to reach
<br>
for a hidden object. In fact, we now know that this explanation is
<br>
correct. Recent experiments, more sophisticated than Piaget's, indicate
<br>
that even very young babies have a well-developed sense of object
<br>
permanency.
<br>
<p>Likewise, dialogue with a small child is highly unreliable.
<br>
Communication via language is never loo percent objective and free of
<br>
the influences of context, emotion, social factors, and possibly
<br>
several other things. Just how unreliable dialogue can be was
<br>
demonstrated by Jacques Mehler and Tom Bever at MIT during the late
<br>
1960s.
<br>
<p>In one experiment, Mehler and Bever carried out the original Piaget
<br>
experiment to test for number conservation, but with two- and
<br>
three-year old children instead of Piaget's four- and five-year-olds.
<br>
The children succeeded perfectly. Consequently, unless we believe that
<br>
children temporarily lose their sense of number conservation between
<br>
the ages of four and six, we clearly need some alternative explanation
<br>
for Piaget's results. One is readily available.
<br>
<p>Around five years of age, children begin to develop the ability to
<br>
reason about another person's thought process (&quot;What Daddy means by
<br>
this is . . . &quot;). This provides the most likely explanation of Piaget's
<br>
observations. Remember the way the experiment was performed. First the
<br>
experimenter arranges the glasses and bottles in two equally spaced
<br>
rows and asks the child which row has more objects. Then the
<br>
experimenter rearranges one of the rows, making it longer, and again
<br>
asks the child, &quot;Which row has more objects?&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, by four or five years of age, a young child knows that adults are
<br>
powerful and are knowledgeable. Moreover, she has probably observed the
<br>
respect her parent showed the experimenter when they arrived at the
<br>
laboratory. How is this child likely to react when she sees the
<br>
experimenter rearrange the objects in one of the two rows and then ask
<br>
the very same question as a moment earlier, &quot;Which row has more
<br>
objects?&quot; She may well reason, &quot;Hmm. That's the same qucstion she just
<br>
asked me. Adults are not dumb, and this is a special kind of adult who
<br>
knows a lot. We can both see that the number of objects hasn't changed.
<br>
So I must have misunderstood the question the last time. I thought she
<br>
was asking me about the number of objects in the row, but obviously she
<br>
was really asking me about the length, since that's what she just
<br>
changed.&quot; And so the child gives the answer she thinks is expected of
<br>
her.
<br>
<p>Of course, we can't know for sure. Attempts to find out by
<br>
interrogating the child are unlikely to yield conclusive evidence, for
<br>
the same reason that the original Piaget experiment is suspect! This is
<br>
where the Mehler and Bever experiment came into its own. The kind of
<br>
&quot;what-does-she-really-want?&quot; reasoning just described is beyond two- or
<br>
three-year olds. Mehler and Bever's younger subjects took the
<br>
experimenters' questions literally, and counted correctly.
<br>
<p>What Piaget's original experiment really showed is that four- and five
<br>
year-old children can reason rationally about the motivations and
<br>
expectations of another person. That's an important and useful
<br>
discovery. But it's not the one Piaget thought he had made!
<br>
<p>To confirm that children from age two upward have a good sense of
<br>
number, Mehler and Bever redesigned the Piaget test to avoid the
<br>
reliance on language. Their idea was breathtakingly simple. Instead of
<br>
glasses and bottles they presented the child with two rows of M&amp;Ms. One
<br>
row contained six M&amp;Ms, the other had four. Sometimes the rows were the
<br>
same length; sometimes the row of six M&amp;Ms was longer; other times the
<br>
row of four M&amp;Ms was longer. Instead of being asked to indicate which
<br>
row had more candies, the child was simply told he could pick one row
<br>
and eat them. The outcome was precisely what any parent would predict.
<br>
The child invariably plumped for the row of six candies, regardless of
<br>
its length. He knew full well which row had more members, and moreover
<br>
realized that the number was not dependent on the arrangement. The
<br>
result was just as conclusive with two-year-old children as with four
<br>
year-olds.
<br>
<p>Another ingenious variation of the original Piaget experiment reached
<br>
the same conclusion. This time, James McGarrigle and Margaret Donaldson
<br>
of the University of Edinburgh carried out their experiment in a small
<br>
puppet theater. Like Piaget, they started by aligning two rows of the
<br>
same number of objects and asking the child which row had more objects.
<br>
After the child responded correctly, the experimenter pretended to look
<br>
away while a teddy bear puppet lengthened one of the rows. Turning
<br>
back, the experimenter exclaimed, &quot;Oh dear, that silly teddy has mixed
<br>
up the rows. can you tell me which row has more objects again?&quot;
<br>
Children from two to five invariably gave the correct answer. Since the
<br>
teddy bear had rearranged one of the rows, unseen by the experimenter,
<br>
the child presumably found it reasonable for the adult to ask the same
<br>
question again. Yet when the experimenter repeated the process with the
<br>
same children but rearranged the objects him- or herself, the four- and
<br>
five-year-old children responded exactly as they had for Piaget, basing
<br>
their answer on length.   -Keith Devlin, The Math Gene (2000)

Sorry for the re-post, but I was very annoyed that I miscalculated
<br>
line lengths in my original post, and the text was almost unreadable.
