<p>
A new model of cerebral cortex development
<br>
<p>For the first time, University of Chicago researchers, using a newly developed
<br>
technique, report that a molecular mechanism involved in formation of limbs
<br>
and
<br>
other body structures is also used to organize the higher functions of the
<br>
brain.
<br>
<p>Specific brain functions, such as vision, touch and memory, are set out in a
<br>
pattern of distinct areas in the outer layer of the brain, the cerebral
<br>
cortex.
<br>
Because these areas can only be seen after birth, it has been impossible until
<br>
now to determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for forming them in the
<br>
embryo.
<br>
<p>&quot;We knew that signaling proteins associated with patterning other parts of the
<br>
body found in the embryo cortex, but we did not have an easy way to find out
<br>
what they were doing there,&quot; said Elizabeth Grove, assistant professor of
<br>
neurobiology, pharmacology and physiology at the University of Chicago and
<br>
principal investigator in the study. &quot;There has been some speculation that
<br>
cortical patterning depended on completely unique mechanisms.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the September 20, 2001 edition of Science Express, the researchers report
<br>
that manipulating one of these signaling proteins in the developing mouse
<br>
brain
<br>
causes radical changes in the cortex.
<br>
<p>Tomomi Fukuchi-Shimogori, Ph.D., research associate in neurobiology,
<br>
pharmacology and physiology at the University of Chicago, and lead author of
<br>
the paper, developed a microsurgical technique that allows her to insert genes
<br>
into the cortex of mice while they are still in utero, about halfway through
<br>
gestation. The mice are born normally and can be analyzed at any age.
<br>
<p>Fibroblast Growth Factor 8 (FGF8), a member of a family of signaling proteins
<br>
involved in forming other structures in the embryo, is normally found near the
<br>
front of the developing cortex. Using this technique, the researchers were
<br>
able
<br>
to manipulate the amount and position of this signaling protein in the embryo
<br>
and look for changes in the cortical pattern much later.
<br>
<p>The researchers increased the amount of the signaling protein in its normal
<br>
position, decreased it by inserting a gene for a receptor able to soak up the
<br>
protein, or expressed it in a new position. Each manipulation profoundly
<br>
affected cortical area pattern.
<br>
<p>&quot;We found very strong evidence that this signaling protein directs the
<br>
development of the cortex,&quot; said Fukuchi-Shimogori.
<br>
<p>With increased expression of this protein the sizes and locations of the areas
<br>
changed. Areas that are towards the front of the cortex and closer to the
<br>
source of the molecule were enlarged at the expense of areas further away from
<br>
the source. Reducing the signaling protein caused shifts in the opposite
<br>
direction.
<br>
<p>&quot;Most dramatic, when a new source of the signaling protein was generated close
<br>
to the back of the embryonic cortex, the whole program changed,&quot; said Grove.
<br>
&quot;Now, a region near the back of the cortex was reprogrammed to form a
<br>
duplicate
<br>
of a more central region, a second touch area. We saw a identical array of
<br>
patches that correspond on a one-to-one basis with the mouse's whiskers.&quot; (see
<br>
illustration)
<br>
<p>The generation of a new cortical area by a molecular manipulation has not been
<br>
seen before and may provide a clue about how the cerebral cortex changes in
<br>
evolution. One way that evolution seems to generate more functionally complex
<br>
brains is by adding new areas to the cortex.
<br>
<p>&quot;We have had no idea how evolution achieved this kind of change,&quot; said Grove.
<br>
&quot;So it is exciting to find that you can add a new area by modifying signaling
<br>
by a single protein.&quot;
<br>
<p>This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the March
<br>
of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation.
