<em>&gt; What?  You must be thinking of a single adult in a high or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average price area.  Lots of people are already *retired*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on about that from the government (my mother is one).  Three

</em><br>
<p>My mother's parents 'live' off of a $27k social security income, except
<br>
for the fact that nan is taking up all of that in the home she lives in,
<br>
while grampy, who is severely Alzheimers/senile, lives in an Extended
<br>
Care Facility here in Lebanon (an hour away from where nan lives) which
<br>
is entirely funded by medicaid.
<br>
<p>My father's mother lives in a condo in Daytona that she paid cash for
<br>
and lives off of her social security (not sure of the amount, but
<br>
somewhat less than $27k) only by the fact that she doesn't have to pay
<br>
any rent and has the funds to pay cash for her cars, which she typically
<br>
drives for no more than 5 years before trading in.
<br>
<p>Retired people can afford to live on a $10k income in some low
<br>
cost-of-living areas of the country only because they enjoy significant
<br>
health care, housing, and energy subisidies from the government in
<br>
addition to that $10k in social security, PLUS they get significant
<br>
discounts on many things on account of their membership in the AARP (the
<br>
Angry Army of Retired Persnicketers). PLUS they are typically exempted
<br>
from local and state taxes that are used for funding the education
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>Since it is economically unfeasible for merchants and others to offer
<br>
such savings to every customer, and since not every retired person can
<br>
live in a low cost-of-living area, AND since the state doesnt' seem to
<br>
be inclined to exempt everybody from taxes, AND not everyone has a nice
<br>
nest egg to draw on from birth, its obviously NOT possible for a person
<br>
to do much beyond simple meager subsistence on a $10k income (and NOTE:
<br>
Senior citizens living on a fixed income typcially don't do much of
<br>
anything with their retirement besides sit around and wait to die).
