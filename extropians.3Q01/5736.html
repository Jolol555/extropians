<p>The General Intelligence Factor
<br>
Despite some popular assertions, a single factor for intelligence, called g,
<br>
can be measured with IQ tests and does predict success in life
<br>
<p>by Linda S. Gottfredson
<br>
<p>What Is versus What Could Be
<br>
<p>&nbsp;No subject in psychology has provoked more intense public controversy than
<br>
the study of human intelligence. From its beginning, research on how and why
<br>
people differ in overall mental ability has fallen prey to political and
<br>
social agendas that obscure or distort even the most well-established
<br>
scientific findings. Journalists, too, often present a view of intelligence
<br>
research that is exactly the opposite of what most intelligence experts
<br>
believe. For these and other reasons, public understanding of intelligence
<br>
falls far short of public concern about it. The IQ experts discussing their
<br>
work in the public arena can feel as though they have fallen down the rabbit
<br>
hole into Alice's Wonderland.
<br>
<p>The debate over intelligence and intelligence testing focuses on the question
<br>
of whether it is useful or meaningful to evaluate people according to a single
<br>
major dimension of cognitive competence. Is there indeed a general mental
<br>
ability we commonly call &quot;intelligence,&quot; and is it important in the practical
<br>
affairs of life? The answer, based on decades of intelligence research, is an
<br>
unequivocal yes. No matter their form or content, tests of mental skills
<br>
invariably point to the existence of a global factor that permeates all
<br>
aspects of cognition. And this factor seems to have considerable influence on
<br>
a person's practical quality of life. Intelligence as measured by IQ tests is
<br>
the single most effective predictor known of individual performance at school
<br>
and on the job. It also predicts many other aspects of well-being, including a
<br>
person's chances of divorcing, dropping out of high school, being unemployed
<br>
or having illegitimate children [see illustration].
<br>
<p>By now the vast majority of intelligence researchers take these findings for
<br>
granted. Yet in the press and in public debate, the facts are typically
<br>
dismissed, downplayed or ignored. This misrepresentation reflects a clash
<br>
between a deeply felt ideal and a stubborn reality. The ideal, implicit in
<br>
many popular critiques of intelligence research, is that all people are born
<br>
equally able and that social inequality results only from the exercise of
<br>
unjust privilege. The reality is that Mother Nature is no egalitarian. People
<br>
are in fact unequal in intellectual potential--and they are born that way,
<br>
just as they are born with different potentials for height, physical
<br>
attractiveness, artistic flair, athletic prowess and other traits. Although
<br>
subsequent experience shapes this potential, no amount of social engineering
<br>
can make individuals with widely divergent mental aptitudes into intellectual
<br>
equals.
<br>
<p>Of course, there are many kinds of talent, many kinds of mental ability and
<br>
many other aspects of personality and character that influence a person's
<br>
chances of happiness and success. The functional importance of general mental
<br>
ability in everyday life, however, means that without onerous restrictions on
<br>
individual liberty, differences in mental competence are likely to result in
<br>
social inequality. This gulf between equal opportunity and equal outcomes is
<br>
perhaps what pains Americans most about the subject of intelligence. The
<br>
public intuitively knows what is at stake: when asked to rank personal
<br>
qualities in order of desirability, people put intelligence second only to
<br>
good health. But with a more realistic approach to the intellectual
<br>
differences between people, society could better accommodate these differences
<br>
and minimize the inequalities they create.
<br>
<p><p>Extracting g
<br>
Early in the century-old study of intelligence, researchers discovered that
<br>
all tests of mental ability ranked individuals in about the same way. Although
<br>
mental tests are often designed to measure specific domains of
<br>
cognition--verbal fluency, say, or mathematical skill, spatial visualization
<br>
or memory--people who do well on one kind of test tend to do well on the
<br>
others, and people who do poorly generally do so across the board. This
<br>
overlap, or intercorrelation, suggests that all such tests measure some global
<br>
element of intellectual ability as well as specific cognitive skills. In
<br>
recent decades, psychologists have devoted much effort to isolating that
<br>
general factor, which is abbreviated g, from the other aspects of cognitive
<br>
ability gauged in mental tests.
<br>
<p>The statistical extraction of g is performed by a technique called factor
<br>
analysis. Introduced at the turn of the century by British psychologist
<br>
Charles Spearman, factor analysis determines the minimum number of underlying
<br>
dimensions necessary to explain a pattern of correlations among measurements.
<br>
A general factor suffusing all tests is not, as is sometimes argued, a
<br>
necessary outcome of factor analysis. No general factor has been found in the
<br>
analysis of personality tests, for example; instead the method usually yields
<br>
at least five dimensions (neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness,
<br>
agreeableness and openness to ideas), each relating to different subsets of
<br>
tests. But, as Spearman observed, a general factor does emerge from analysis
<br>
of mental ability tests, and leading psychologists, such as Arthur R. Jensen
<br>
of the University of California at Berkeley and John B. Carroll of the
<br>
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, have confirmed his findings in
<br>
the decades since. Partly because of this research, most intelligence experts
<br>
now use g as the working definition of intelligence.
<br>
<p>The general factor explains most differences among individuals in performance
<br>
on diverse mental tests. This is true regardless of what specific ability a
<br>
test is meant to assess, regardless of the test's manifest content (whether
<br>
words, numbers or figures) and regardless of the way the test is administered
<br>
(in written or oral form, to an individual or to a group). Tests of specific
<br>
mental abilities do measure those abilities, but they all reflect g to varying
<br>
degrees as well. Hence, the g factor can be extracted from scores on any
<br>
diverse battery of tests.
<br>
<p>Conversely, because every mental test is &quot;contaminated&quot; by the effects of
<br>
specific mental skills, no single test measures only g. Even the scores from
<br>
IQ tests--which usually combine about a dozen subtests of specific cognitive
<br>
skills--contain some &quot;impurities&quot; that reflect those narrower skills. For most
<br>
purposes, these impurities make no practical difference, and g and IQ can be
<br>
used interchangeably. But if they need to, intelligence researchers can
<br>
statistically separate the g component of IQ. The ability to isolate g has
<br>
revolutionized research on general intelligence, because it has allowed
<br>
investigators to show that the predictive value of mental tests derives almost
<br>
entirely from this global factor rather than from the more specific aptitudes
<br>
measured by intelligence tests.
<br>
<p>In addition to quantifying individual differences, tests of mental abilities
<br>
have also offered insight into the meaning of intelligence in everyday life.
<br>
Some tests and test items are known to correlate better with g than others do.
<br>
In these items the &quot;active ingredient&quot; that demands the exercise of g seems to
<br>
be complexity. More complex tasks require more mental manipulation, and this
<br>
manipulation of information--discerning similarities and inconsistencies,
<br>
drawing inferences, grasping new concepts and so on--constitutes intelligence
<br>
in action. Indeed, intelligence can best be described as the ability to deal
<br>
with cognitive complexity.
<br>
<p>This description coincides well with lay perceptions of intelligence. The g
<br>
factor is especially important in just the kind of behaviors that people
<br>
usually associate with &quot;smarts&quot;: reasoning, problem solving, abstract
<br>
thinking, quick learning. And whereas g itself describes mental aptitude
<br>
rather than accumulated knowledge, a person's store of knowledge tends to
<br>
correspond with his or her g level, probably because that accumulation
<br>
represents a previous adeptness in learning and in understanding new
<br>
information. The g factor is also the one attribute that best distinguishes
<br>
among persons considered gifted, average or retarded.
<br>
<p>Several decades of factor-analytic research on mental tests have confirmed a
<br>
hierarchical model of mental abilities. The evidence, summarized most
<br>
effectively in Carroll's 1993 book, Human Cognitive Abilities, puts g at the
<br>
apex in this model, with more specific aptitudes arrayed at successively lower
<br>
levels: the so-called group factors, such as verbal ability, mathematical
<br>
reasoning, spatial visualization and memory, are just below g, and below these
<br>
are skills that are more dependent on knowledge or experience, such as the
<br>
principles and practices of a particular job or profession.
<br>
<p>Some researchers use the term &quot;multiple intelligences&quot; to label these sets of
<br>
narrow capabilities and achievements. Psychologist Howard Gardner of Harvard
<br>
University, for example, has postulated that eight relatively autonomous
<br>
&quot;intelligences&quot; are exhibited in different domains of achievement. He does not
<br>
dispute the existence of g but treats it as a specific factor relevant chiefly
<br>
to academic achievement and to situations that resemble those of school.
<br>
Gardner does not believe that tests can fruitfully measure his proposed
<br>
intelligences; without tests, no one can at present determine whether the
<br>
intelligences are indeed independent of g (or each other). Furthermore, it is
<br>
not clear to what extent Gardner's intelligences tap personality traits or
<br>
motor skills rather than mental aptitudes.
<br>
<p>Other forms of intelligence have been proposed; among them, emotional
<br>
intelligence and practical intelligence are perhaps the best known. They are
<br>
probably amalgams either of intellect and personality or of intellect and
<br>
informal experience in specific job or life settings, respectively. Practical
<br>
intelligence like &quot;street smarts,&quot; for example, seems to consist of the
<br>
localized knowledge and know-how developed with untutored experience in
<br>
particular everyday settings and activities--the so-called school of hard
<br>
knocks. In contrast, general intelligence is not a form of achievement,
<br>
whether local or renowned. Instead the g factor regulates the rate of
<br>
learning: it greatly affects the rate of return in knowledge to instruction
<br>
and experience but cannot substitute for either.
<br>
<p><p>The Biology of g
<br>
Some critics of intelligence research maintain that the notion of general
<br>
intelligence is illusory: that no such global mental capacity exists and that
<br>
apparent &quot;intelligence&quot; is really just a by-product of one's opportunities to
<br>
learn skills and information valued in a particular cultural context. True,
<br>
the concept of intelligence and the way in which individuals are ranked
<br>
according to this criterion could be social artifacts. But the fact that g is
<br>
not specific to any particular domain of knowledge or mental skill suggests
<br>
that g is independent of cultural content, including beliefs about what
<br>
intelligence is. And tests of different social groups reveal the same
<br>
continuum of general intelligence. This observation suggests either that
<br>
cultures do not construct g or that they construct the same g. Both
<br>
conclusions undercut the social artifact theory of intelligence.
<br>
<p>Moreover, research on the physiology and genetics of g has uncovered
<br>
biological correlates of this psychological phenomenon. In the past decade,
<br>
studies by teams of researchers in North America and Europe have linked
<br>
several attributes of the brain to general intelligence. After taking into
<br>
account gender and physical stature, brain size as determined by magnetic
<br>
resonance imaging is moderately correlated with IQ (about 0.4 on a scale of 0
<br>
to 1). So is the speed of nerve conduction. The brains of bright people also
<br>
use less energy during problem solving than do those of their less able peers.
<br>
And various qualities of brain waves correlate strongly (about 0.5 to 0.7)
<br>
with IQ: the brain waves of individuals with higher IQs, for example, respond
<br>
more promptly and consistently to simple sensory stimuli such as audible
<br>
clicks. These observations have led some investigators to posit that
<br>
differences in g result from differences in the speed and efficiency of neural
<br>
processing. If this theory is true, environmental conditions could influence g
<br>
by modifying brain physiology in some manner.
<br>
<p>Studies of so-called elementary cognitive tasks (ECTs), conducted by Jensen
<br>
and others, are bridging the gap between the psychological and the
<br>
physiological aspects of g. These mental tasks have no obvious intellectual
<br>
content and are so simple that adults and most children can do them accurately
<br>
in less than a second. In the most basic reaction-time tests, for example, the
<br>
subject must react when a light goes on by lifting her index finger off a home
<br>
button and immediately depressing a response button. Two measurements are
<br>
taken: the number of milliseconds between the illumination of the light and
<br>
the subject's release of the home button, which is called decision time, and
<br>
the number of milliseconds between the subject's release of the home button
<br>
and pressing of the response button, which is called movement time.
<br>
<p>In this task, movement time seems independent of intelligence, but the
<br>
decision times of higher-IQ subjects are slightly faster than those of people
<br>
with lower IQs. As the tasks are made more complex, correlations between
<br>
average decision times and IQ increase. These results further support the
<br>
notion that intelligence equips individuals to deal with complexity and that
<br>
its influence is greater in complex tasks than in simple ones.
<br>
<p>The ECT-IQ correlations are comparable for all IQ levels, ages, genders and
<br>
racial-ethnic groups tested. Moreover, studies by Philip A. Vernon of the
<br>
University of Western Ontario and others have shown that the ECT-IQ overlap
<br>
results almost entirely from the common g factor in both measures. Reaction
<br>
times do not reflect differences in motivation or strategy or the tendency of
<br>
some individuals to rush through tests and daily tasks--that penchant is a
<br>
personality trait. They actually seem to measure the speed with which the
<br>
brain apprehends, integrates and evaluates information. Research on ECTs and
<br>
brain physiology has not yet identified the biological determinants of this
<br>
processing speed. These studies do suggest, however, that g is as reliable and
<br>
global a phenomenon at the neural level as it is at the level of the complex
<br>
information processing required by IQ tests and everyday life.
<br>
<p>The existence of biological correlates of intelligence does not necessarily
<br>
mean that intelligence is dictated by genes. Decades of genetics research have
<br>
shown, however, that people are born with different hereditary potentials for
<br>
intelligence and that these genetic endowments are responsible for much of the
<br>
variation in mental ability among individuals. Last spring an international
<br>
team of scientists headed by Robert Plomin of the Institute of Psychiatry in
<br>
London announced the discovery of the first gene linked to intelligence. Of
<br>
course, genes have their effects only in interaction with environments, partly
<br>
by enhancing an individual's exposure or sensitivity to formative experiences.
<br>
Differences in general intelligence, whether measured as IQ or, more
<br>
accurately, as g are both genetic and environmental in origin--just as are all
<br>
other psychological traits and attitudes studied so far, including
<br>
personality, vocational interests and societal attitudes. This is old news
<br>
among the experts. The experts have, however, been startled by more recent
<br>
discoveries.
<br>
<p>One is that the heritability of IQ rises with age--that is to say, the extent
<br>
to which genetics accounts for differences in IQ among individuals increases
<br>
as people get older. Studies comparing identical and fraternal twins,
<br>
published in the past decade by a group led by Thomas J. Bouchard, Jr., of the
<br>
University of Minnesota and other scholars, show that about 40 percent of IQ
<br>
differences among preschoolers stems from genetic differences but that
<br>
heritability rises to 60 percent by adolescence and to 80 percent by late
<br>
adulthood. With age, differences among individuals in their developed
<br>
intelligence come to mirror more closely their genetic differences. It appears
<br>
that the effects of environment on intelligence fade rather than grow with
<br>
time. In hindsight, perhaps this should have come as no surprise. Young
<br>
children have the circumstances of their lives imposed on them by parents,
<br>
schools and other agents of society, but as people get older they become more
<br>
independent and tend to seek out the life niches that are most congenial to
<br>
their genetic proclivities.
<br>
<p>A second big surprise for intelligence experts was the discovery that
<br>
environments shared by siblings have little to do with IQ. Many people still
<br>
mistakenly believe that social, psychological and economic differences among
<br>
families create lasting and marked differences in IQ. Behavioral geneticists
<br>
refer to such environmental effects as &quot;shared&quot; because they are common to
<br>
siblings who grow up together. Research has shown that although shared
<br>
environments do have a modest influence on IQ in childhood, their effects
<br>
dissipate by adolescence. The IQs of adopted children, for example, lose all
<br>
resemblance to those of their adoptive family members and become more like the
<br>
IQs of the biological parents they have never known. Such findings suggest
<br>
that siblings either do not share influential aspects of the rearing
<br>
environment or do not experience them in the same way. Much behavioral
<br>
genetics research currently focuses on the still mysterious processes by which
<br>
environments make members of a household less alike.
<br>
<p><p>g on the Job
<br>
Although the evidence of genetic and physiological correlates of g argues
<br>
powerfully for the existence of global intelligence, it has not quelled the
<br>
critics of intelligence testing. These skeptics argue that even if such a
<br>
global entity exists, it has no intrinsic functional value and becomes
<br>
important only to the extent that people treat it as such: for example, by
<br>
using IQ scores to sort, label and assign students and employees. Such
<br>
concerns over the proper use of mental tests have prompted a great deal of
<br>
research in recent decades. This research shows that although IQ tests can
<br>
indeed be misused, they measure a capability that does in fact affect many
<br>
kinds of performance and many life outcomes, independent of the tests'
<br>
interpretations or applications. Moreover, the research shows that
<br>
intelligence tests measure the capability equally well for all native-born
<br>
English-speaking groups in the U.S.
<br>
<p>If we consider that intelligence manifests itself in everyday life as the
<br>
ability to deal with complexity, then it is easy to see why it has great
<br>
functional or practical importance. Children, for example, are regularly
<br>
exposed to complex tasks once they begin school. Schooling requires above all
<br>
that students learn, solve problems and think abstractly. That IQ is quite a
<br>
good predictor of differences in educational achievement is therefore not
<br>
surprising. When scores on both IQ and standardized achievement tests in
<br>
different subjects are averaged over several years, the two averages correlate
<br>
as highly as different IQ tests from the same individual do. High-ability
<br>
students also master material at many times the rate of their low-ability
<br>
peers. Many investigations have helped quantify this discrepancy. For example,
<br>
a 1969 study done for the U.S. Army by the Human Resources Research Office
<br>
found that enlistees in the bottom fifth of the ability distribution required
<br>
two to six times as many teaching trials and prompts as did their
<br>
higher-ability peers to attain minimal proficiency in rifle assembly,
<br>
monitoring signals, combat plotting and other basic military tasks. Similarly,
<br>
in school settings the ratio of learning rates between &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot;
<br>
students is typically five to one.
<br>
<p>The scholarly content of many IQ tests and their strong correlations with
<br>
educational success can give the impression that g is only a narrow academic
<br>
ability. But general mental ability also predicts job performance, and in more
<br>
complex jobs it does so better than any other single personal trait, including
<br>
education and experience. The army's Project A, a seven-year study conducted
<br>
in the 1980s to improve the recruitment and training process, found that
<br>
general mental ability correlated strongly with both technical proficiency and
<br>
soldiering in the nine specialties studied, among them infantry, military
<br>
police and medical specialist. Research in the civilian sector has revealed
<br>
the same pattern. Furthermore, although the addition of personality traits
<br>
such as conscientiousness can help hone the prediction of job performance, the
<br>
inclusion of specific mental aptitudes such as verbal fluency or mathematical
<br>
skill rarely does. The predictive value of mental tests in the work arena
<br>
stems almost entirely from their measurement of g, and that value rises with
<br>
the complexity and prestige level of the job.
<br>
<p>Half a century of military and civilian research has converged to draw a
<br>
portrait of occupational opportunity along the IQ continuum. Individuals in
<br>
the top 5 percent of the adult IQ distribution (above IQ 125) can essentially
<br>
train themselves, and few occupations are beyond their reach mentally. Persons
<br>
of average IQ (between 90 and 110) are not competitive for most professional
<br>
and executive-level work but are easily trained for the bulk of jobs in the
<br>
American economy. In contrast, adults in the bottom 5 percent of the IQ
<br>
distribution (below 75) are very difficult to train and are not competitive
<br>
for any occupation on the basis of ability. Serious problems in training
<br>
low-IQ military recruits during World War II led Congress to ban enlistment
<br>
from the lowest 10 percent (below 80) of the population, and no civilian
<br>
occupation in modern economies routinely recruits its workers from that range.
<br>
Current military enlistment standards exclude any individual whose IQ is below
<br>
about 85.
<br>
<p>The importance of g in job performance, as in schooling, is related to
<br>
complexity. Occupations differ considerably in the complexity of their
<br>
demands, and as that complexity rises, higher g levels become a bigger asset
<br>
and lower g levels a bigger handicap. Similarly, everyday tasks and
<br>
environments also differ significantly in their cognitive complexity. The
<br>
degree to which a person's g level will come to bear on daily life depends on
<br>
how much novelty and ambiguity that person's everyday tasks and surroundings
<br>
present and how much continual learning, judgment and decision making they
<br>
require. As gamblers, employers and bankers know, even marginal differences in
<br>
rates of return will yield big gains--or losses--over time. Hence, even small
<br>
differences in g among people can exert large, cumulative influences across
<br>
social and economic life.
<br>
<p>In my own work, I have tried to synthesize the many lines of research that
<br>
document the influence of IQ on life outcomes. As the illustration shows, the
<br>
odds of various kinds of achievement and social pathology change
<br>
systematically across the IQ continuum, from borderline mentally retarded
<br>
(below 70) to intellectually gifted (above 130). Even in comparisons of those
<br>
of somewhat below average (between 76 and 90) and somewhat above average
<br>
(between 111 and 125) IQs, the odds for outcomes having social consequence are
<br>
stacked against the less able. Young men somewhat below average in general
<br>
mental ability, for example, are more likely to be unemployed than men
<br>
somewhat above average. The lower-IQ woman is four times more likely to bear
<br>
illegitimate children than the higher-IQ woman; among mothers, she is eight
<br>
times more likely to become a chronic welfare recipient. People somewhat below
<br>
average are 88 times more likely to drop out of high school, seven times more
<br>
likely to be jailed and five times more likely as adults to live in poverty
<br>
than people of somewhat above-average IQ. Below-average individuals are 50
<br>
percent more likely to be divorced than those in the above-average category.
<br>
<p>These odds diverge even more sharply for people with bigger gaps in IQ, and
<br>
the mechanisms by which IQ creates this divergence are not yet clearly
<br>
understood. But no other single trait or circumstance yet studied is so deeply
<br>
implicated in the nexus of bad social outcomes--poverty, welfare, illegitimacy
<br>
and educational failure--that entraps many low-IQ individuals and families.
<br>
Even the effects of family background pale in comparison with the influence of
<br>
IQ. As shown most recently by Charles Murray of the American Enterprise
<br>
Institute in Washington, D.C., the divergence in many outcomes associated with
<br>
IQ level is almost as wide among siblings from the same household as it is for
<br>
strangers of comparable IQ levels. And siblings differ a lot in IQ--on
<br>
average, by 12 points, compared with 17 for random strangers.
<br>
<p>An IQ of 75 is perhaps the most important threshold in modern life. At that
<br>
level, a person's chances of mastering the elementary school curriculum are
<br>
only 50-50, and he or she will have a hard time functioning independently
<br>
without considerable social support. Individuals and families who are only
<br>
somewhat below average in IQ face risks of social pathology that, while lower,
<br>
are still significant enough to jeopardize their well-being. High-IQ
<br>
individuals may lack the resolve, character or good fortune to capitalize on
<br>
their intellectual capabilities, but socioeconomic success in the
<br>
postindustrial information age is theirs to lose.
<br>
<p><p>What Is versus What Could Be
<br>
The foregoing findings on g's effects have been drawn from studies conducted
<br>
under a limited range of circumstances--namely, the social, economic and
<br>
political conditions prevailing now and in recent decades in developed
<br>
countries that allow considerable personal freedom. It is not clear whether
<br>
these findings apply to populations around the world, to the extremely
<br>
advantaged and disadvantaged in the developing world or, for that matter, to
<br>
people living under restrictive political regimes. No one knows what research
<br>
under different circumstances, in different eras or with different populations
<br>
might reveal.
<br>
<p>But we do know that, wherever freedom and technology advance, life is an
<br>
uphill battle for people who are below average in proficiency at learning,
<br>
solving problems and mastering complexity. We also know that the trajectories
<br>
of mental development are not easily deflected. Individual IQ levels tend to
<br>
remain unchanged from adolescence onward, and despite strenuous efforts over
<br>
the past half a century, attempts to raise g permanently through adoption or
<br>
educational means have failed. If there is a reliable, ethical way to raise or
<br>
equalize levels of g, no one has found it.
<br>
<p>Some investigators have suggested that biological interventions, such as
<br>
dietary supplements of vitamins, may be more effective than educational ones
<br>
in raising g levels. This approach is based in part on the assumption that
<br>
improved nutrition has caused the puzzling rise in average levels of both IQ
<br>
and height in the developed world during this century. Scientists are still
<br>
hotly debating whether the gains in IQ actually reflect a rise in g or are
<br>
caused instead by changes in less critical, specific mental skills. Whatever
<br>
the truth may be, the differences in mental ability among individuals remain,
<br>
and the conflict between equal opportunity and equal outcome persists. Only by
<br>
accepting these hard truths about intelligence will society find humane
<br>
solutions to the problems posed by the variations in general mental ability.
