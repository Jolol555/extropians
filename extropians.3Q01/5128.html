<br>
<em>&gt; Lets see, your comparing Heston to Clinton, a drug dealer, and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prostitute. I think I know political propaganda when I hear it.
</em><br>
<p>You are projecting your conservative biases onto me.  I don't lump Clinton,
<br>
drugs and sex together in a single continuum of liberal sin.  I thought I
<br>
was giving unrelated examples of &quot;plausible deniability&quot;, where the speaker
<br>
dances around a topic without specifically admitting anything.  They all
<br>
believe in their cause, but don't want to admit it publicly to the
<br>
authorities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;When he says his Creator gave him a gift which might be used in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the political process, he implies that God will guide him to run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;for president and guide his decisions while he is president.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He never says any such thing in this speech. Retraction please.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;If my Creator gave me the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of
<br>
those great men, then I want to use that same gift now to reconnect you with
<br>
your own sense of liberty of your own freedom of thought ... your own
<br>
compass for what is right.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;When he says we are fighting a great civil war and cultural war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that is trying to hijack our birthright, he is implying that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;wants to turn back history to earlier political times and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rights based on birth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He says nor implys any such thing
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I believe that we are again engaged in a great civil war, a cultural war
<br>
that's about to hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your
<br>
heart.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The &quot;birthright&quot; he is refering to is the birth of our nation, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right of free speech.
</em><br>
<p>His quote of Lincoln was referring to the birth of our nation and the right
<br>
of free speech.  However, Heston said we are about to fight *another* such
<br>
war today when he said, &quot;Those words are true again.  I believe that we are
<br>
again engaged in a great civil war, a cultural war....&quot;  This second war is
<br>
not referring to the first one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;When he says that he that our problems are bigger than the gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;issue, he implies that the gun issue is at its core.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nonsense, he's saying there are more important issues than guns and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he should be listed to for what he is saying, not because he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the elected president of the NRA.
</em><br>
<p>He clearly describes his realization of this bigger issue in terms of his
<br>
being president of the NRA and being &quot;in the cross hairs of those who target
<br>
Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that firearms are not the only
<br>
issue.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; he's saying that if there is such a thing as black pride then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; white pride, red pride, is equally valid. He is correct.
</em><br>
<p>He is correct.  But he doesn't say all pride is equally valid.  He is
<br>
specifically arguing for the validity of white pride.  He singles it out and
<br>
implies that it needs to be bolstered up compared to the others.  He implies
<br>
that whites need more pride now while blacks and other races have enough
<br>
pride.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, sometimes these groups do try to get special treatment laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passed, hate crimes are an example. When someone who is gay refers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to themselves as gay they have drawn a distinction, it is equally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ok for anyone else to make that distinction.
</em><br>
<p>Hate crime laws are not an example of gay rights.  They are racial laws
<br>
which sometimes include sexual orientation or gender.  These laws give
<br>
sentencing guidelines for criminals not rights to citizens.  Gay
<br>
equal-rights laws would be ones advocating marriage, cohabitation,
<br>
insurance, joint tax returns, inheriting property, joint ownership of
<br>
property, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;When he spoke against the Axis Powers in World War II, and draws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a parallel between the holocaust and what is currently happening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to gun owners, he implies the holocaust was less than it was or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that gun control equals Nazi atrocities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He implies no such thing, he said &quot;But during a speech, when I drew
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an analogy between singling out innocent Jews and singling out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.&quot; He is arguing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against singling out those who haven't done anything wrong, he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about unreasoned prejudice.
</em><br>
<p>Give me a break.  He compares gun-owners' persecution to the Holocaust.  He
<br>
compares gun-control advocates to Nazis.  This is inflammatory hyperbole at
<br>
best.  I can't believe anyone would argue for the validity of this analogy.
<br>
It was a stupid PR blunder, period.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;When he gives an example of dental patients who got AIDS from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;dentists who didn't disclose it, he implies that AIDS patients
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;must be publicly disclosed and kept away from the general public.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He did not say anything about keeping them away, but he does feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their patients have a right to know. Shall we take a vote?
</em><br>
<p>No, but you make my point for me.  You think you know what he said, but read
<br>
it carefully.  He never said the patients have a right to know.  He merely
<br>
implied it.  He said it was bad that they didn't know.  You are taking the
<br>
ball and running with it.  You are deriving conclusions from the speech that
<br>
were not explicitly spelled out as part of his agenda.  This is the exact
<br>
kind of implications I was talking about.  I think you caught this one
<br>
because you agreed with it.  I think you would catch more of the other ones
<br>
if you were inclined to agree with them as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;When he points out that Dr. King said &quot;negroes&quot; but its not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;allowed now, he implies that we should be allowed classify people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;into another race by the color of their skin.
</em><br>
<p>He was specifically arguing against hyphenated terminology like
<br>
African-American which refers to their geographical origin.  He was
<br>
specifically arguing for the terms &quot;black&quot; or &quot;negro&quot; which refers to the
<br>
color of their skin.  He wants to classify these people by the color of
<br>
their skin and not by their geographical origin.  It seems obvious from the
<br>
words.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; COME ON NOW! How do you derive that from what he said! From now on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone referring to me as &quot;white&quot; is a racist. Now do you see?
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  If someone didn't want to call people Scottish, British, Irish,
<br>
Swedish, but insisted that they all be called &quot;white&quot; because they look
<br>
alike, I think that would be racist.  It's more than just a passing
<br>
adjective.  Heston is actually arguing against one set of terminology and
<br>
for another.  This is not a statement out of context.  He is actually giving
<br>
a speech to the NRA about their right to use the word &quot;negro&quot; instead of
<br>
&quot;African-American&quot; because they prefer the term.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;When he claims to be a Native American because he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;blood-initiated into a tribe, he implies that we should discount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;any racism that native Americans see because he is one and doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;see any discrimination.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He referred to this in a very brief discussion as to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awkwardness of hyphenated names. Mr. Heston believes citizens of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this country are &quot;Americans&quot;, period.
</em><br>
<p>Then why does he want to distinguish between race, sex, or sexual
<br>
orientation then?  Why not call them all American?  They are all &quot;American&quot;
<br>
when he doesn't want to recognize differences, but they are all different
<br>
groups when he does want to recognize differences.  Likewise, he wants
<br>
freedom of speech for some topics, but then argues against freedom of speech
<br>
for certain songs, teachers or entertainers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;When he says one can talk about race without being a racist, he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;implies that he wants to talk about race and make decisions based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;on race.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, he means what he said, I can refer to someone as black or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hispanic or white or anything else, imparting information without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negatively discriminating.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Talking about race&quot; is more than just referencing someone.  He wants to
<br>
&quot;recognize&quot; the difference, &quot;discuss&quot; the differences, and by implication
<br>
act on the differences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;When he says that one can see distinctions between genders without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;being sexist, it implies that he wants to observe differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;between genders and probably make decisions based on gender.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, once again he is saying that you can refer to the obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences in people without meaning anything negative.
</em><br>
<p>Again, no.  See above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;When he says you can think critically about a denomination without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;being anti-religion, it implies that he wants to criticize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;specific religions for their beliefs without criticizing others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again he is saying that you can make observations based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference without implying any sort of negativity.
</em><br>
<p>Same as above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;When he says you can accept but not celebrate homosexuality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;without being a homophobe, he implies that we can accept that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;exists but we don't have to like it or even cooperate with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He didn't say the second part but in this case  I think that's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty good implication based on the facts.
</em><br>
<p>Again, he didn't say it, but it sure is implied.  Why did you feel compelled
<br>
to agree that it's a pretty good implication based on the facts?  Because it
<br>
is clear what the implication is, even if he doesn't say it.  Again, I
<br>
believe that you would see more of the other implications if you were
<br>
inclined to agree with them.  Or, let me ask this in a more leading way:  Do
<br>
you think a racist would read more of these implications into this speech
<br>
than you would?  I think the code-words and possible implications are there
<br>
for those who want to latch onto them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;When he says disobedience is in our DNA and follows the awesome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;power of Gandhi, Thoreau, and Jesus, he implies a racial rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and manifest destiny for certain groups.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For Indians, writers and a christian mystic?
</em><br>
<p>No.  He said who he was addressing.  &quot;You are the best and the brightest.
<br>
You, here in the fertile cradle of American academia, here in the castle of
<br>
learning on the Charles River, you are the cream.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You mean the part about the ICE-T song about murdering an innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cop? He was taking that position as a stockholder that it was wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the company to profit from such a thing, and he put his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reputation on the line to defend what he thought was right.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  He argues for his right to use terms and say things that people
<br>
don't want him to say, but then he also brags that he got Ice-T's contract
<br>
cancelled because he didn't like the lyrics of a song.  I thought this was
<br>
inconsistent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Heston's speech was about free speech, not the political correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jargon that passes for free speech these days, period.
</em><br>
<p>I wish.  If he had argued for free speech for everybody, I would have
<br>
agreed.  But he seemed to criticize the speech of others as much as he
<br>
argued for his own right to speak.  I did not feel like he was arguing for
<br>
my right to speak on any issues I might speak out on.
<br>
<p>As I read this, I felt like Heston would classify me as one of the liberals,
<br>
as one of the politically correct, as one of the non-Christians, or in some
<br>
other way as one of the enemy in the &quot;cultural war&quot; or second &quot;civil war&quot;
<br>
that he is fighting.  I certainly did not feel that he was arguing for my
<br>
rights.  In fact, I got the distinct impression that he was against gay
<br>
rights, women's rights, blacks rights, native American rights and many other
<br>
rights for groups that were somehow different than his own.  In fact, the
<br>
only rights he specifically supported seemed to be for white, males in the
<br>
U.S. who shared a birthright of revolution.  This was not an inclusive
<br>
speech.
