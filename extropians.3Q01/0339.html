Sorry to pop your bubble, Spike. But &quot;less soluble&quot; does not mean &quot;negligible&quot;. See for instance
<br>

<p>You can get the bends on oxy-helium; it's just harder.
<br>
<p>IIRC, Argon and Xenon have already been experimented with by the military (Navy, I assume); I have heard rumors that
<br>
Sulfur Hexafluoride has been experimented with, as well; the molecule is so big it is alleged to not penetrate tissues
<br>
fast. I don't know how high they've taken the pressures.
<br>
<p>I'm researching the high pressure noble gas toxicity issues. There is (also?) an effect called High Pressure Nervous
<br>
Syndrome that is at least somewhat documented. Details when I find something that looks adequately authoritative. This
<br>
might be hard, since the exotic mix work is/was probably classified.

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The air we breathe consists of about 0.2 atmospheres
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of oxygen and about 0.8 atmospheres nitrogen. Divers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  have shown that helium can be substituted for the nitrogen,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  since the body does not use either substance.  Helium
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  actually works better for high pressure applications, since it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a noble gas, and so does not react with or dissolve in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  bloodstream like nitrogen will do under sufficient pressure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  In a diving bell, oxygen can be held at .2 atmospheres and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  helium added with no apparent harm or discomfort to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The noble gas xenon is chemically similar to helium,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  except for being nearly 33 times denser.  If a person
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  were to be placed in a pressure chamber with oxygen held at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  0.2 atmospheres, then xenon added until the total pressure came
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  up to about 190 atmospheres, the density of the gas mixture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in the chamber would be about equal to that of water.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  person would then float.  It would simulate weightlessness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  better than being in water, since the xenonaut could breathe the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  medium in which she was floating.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The partial pressure of oxygen would need to be increased
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  somewhat to counteract the tendency of the oxygen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  float to the top, however there is no reason to doubt that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  humans could swim in xenon.  The experience would not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  be exactly the same as floating in your living room however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  for the pitch of the voice varies as the inverse square root
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of the density of the medium. The xenon swimmer's voice
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  would be lowered by nearly 4 octaves, causing her to talk
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  like Lurch the butler.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It would take no extraordinary engineering of pressure vessels
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to accommodate 190 atmospheres.  In fact even a relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  thin walled container would do fine, if one could arrange to lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it into the sea as the pressure is raised.  Alternately, the chamber
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  could be placed at the bottom of a mile-deep shaft and water could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  be allowed to flow in as the pressure is raised, then drained
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  as the pressure is lowered.  Even if the pressure needed to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  dropped quickly, this should not present a problem, since it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  been pointed out that the solubility of xenon is negligible.  The worst
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  possible effect would be the expanding xenon would escape from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the bodily orifices into which it has been forced during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  pressurization, perhaps creating embarrassing noises.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The one killer app for weightlessness that eeeeveryone wants
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to try might not work out either, since one likely could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  breathe fast enough.  The dense column of xenon would resist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  changing direction quickly, so the participants could scarcely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  get their breathing rate much above 1 Hz, insuffient for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  kind of activity.  Then there's the problem of sounding like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Jabba the Hut and Mrs. Hut on their honeymoon, which might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in itself spoil the mood.  Other than that, one could put together
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a really cool sensory deprivation chamber.  spike
