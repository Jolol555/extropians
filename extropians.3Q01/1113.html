Eliezer,
<br>
<p>Thank you very much for such a thorough, thoughtful and rich
<br>
response.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I very much appreciate this point.  This possibility is one of
<br>
the reason that I have fought against my own spirituality as
<br>
often as I have.  Great care must be taken not to overthrow
<br>
rationality in the desire for the supra-rational or for aspects
<br>
of the problem of being that cannot be easily approached with
<br>
the tools of rational analysis.
<br>
<p>Finding the balance where all of one's tools are brought to bear
<br>
without undercutting one another and where all aspects of what
<br>
we care about can be dealt with well is my goal.  
<br>
<p>But I don't believe we can wait until post-Singularity to deal
<br>
with these problems and aspects.  I think they are critical to
<br>
our ever reaching Singularity with the best hope of having more
<br>
abundant being (or any at all) afterward and of moving with much
<br>
less strife and needless suffering to the Singularity now and in
<br>
the coming years.  
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Actually, I *don't* believe that any ways of thought that lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorrect conclusions will turn out to be ultimately important.  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;being in harmony with the Universe&quot;, a &quot;clear pool&quot;, an undistorting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mirror, i.e., correct conclusions, is the sigil of all things worthy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; care.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; But that's really almost irrelevant.  
</em><br>
<p>That one sat me up in my chair.  How can all things worthy of
<br>
care be &quot;irrelevant&quot;?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; A human being is a seed, in the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way that present-day civilization is a seed.  Most of my effort goes into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protecting the civilization, rather than myself, but I can't really know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what's worth defending unless I at least think about what I'd be defending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if I was defending myself.  And the answer, on an individual level, and on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a civilization level, is that what must be defended above all is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The potential is contained within the actual.  So the actual
<br>
must be defended at least in its aspect of containing and
<br>
nurturing/bringing to fruition the potential.  Much of the
<br>
importance of these things that are lumped under spirituality
<br>
and the supra-rational, supra-scientific (if you will forgive
<br>
the phraseology) is that they are about granting deep value to
<br>
the potential and most of all, some of them are about what is
<br>
necessary for the potential to become actual.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So I tend to be really unfond of self-reinforcing incorrect beliefs that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will probably lead a great many people to refuse to take part in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity for utterly wrong reasons.  I'm very suspicious of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertion that there might be something to be valued in spirituality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless you can give me an example of something specific to be valued.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect value only when I have reason to do so.  But people often &quot;want&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see value, in one of the many awful cases where human thinking distorts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the premises to make the conclusions less uncomfortable.  I see that as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative force in the Universe.  So I'm suspicious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>To me spirituality is about the apprehension and the actual
<br>
creation of the deepest and most truly glorious potential
<br>
possible.  That is the heart of the matter.  
<br>
<p>Also I am deeply concerned than in our rush to singularity we
<br>
sometimes tend to strip away everything that makes us less
<br>
technologically focused or that might give us pause.  Even if
<br>
there is reason to pause and consider.  I am especially
<br>
concerned when it seems that an intellectual elite, devoted
<br>
perhaps in an unbalanced extreme to technology and science, will
<br>
decide the shape of the future of all human beings forever
<br>
without necessarily understanding or enrolling those human
<br>
beings or with a deep enough committment to their well-being. 
<br>
This doesn't apply so much to you, Eliezer (and some others
<br>
here), as I know of your deep committment to the well-being of
<br>
all.  But it is something that very much concerns me.
<br>
<p>It also concerns me when I don't see that we really are
<br>
conceiving of what we will do with our power and our freedom on
<br>
a deep enough level.  I don't see how we are generally preparing
<br>
ourselves by envisioning the type of being we wish to be and be
<br>
part of creating clearly and what measures we should be taking
<br>
now to best insure and bring into actuality of this outcome. 
<br>
Again, Eliezer (and others), I know that you do give much
<br>
thought to this.  
<br>
<p>I also believe that unless you can enroll more of humanity in
<br>
this enterprise of creating the kind of future we envision there
<br>
will be a lot of conflict, chaos and death that was not
<br>
necessary.  Even if I believed fully that science and rational
<br>
inquiry were the only necessities and all of what is required,
<br>
there is no way that you can spread that view and committment to
<br>
it to very much of the population quickly enough to make a
<br>
difference.  The timeframe is extremely short.  In view of this
<br>
I believe it is essential that a spiritual/religious set of
<br>
memes relevant to creating this vibrant vision of the future and
<br>
making it real also be created and deployed. 
<br>
<p>I pledge to do everything in my power to make it so for the sake
<br>
of humanity and for the future that we all desire.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If a different way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; looking at my life,  what I am doing, what we are all doing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what can come of it integrates into something that strengthens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; my ability to contribute maximally and may help others to do so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then that is in itself quite important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Can a vision of the type of future you wish to create come only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from rationality or do you need to add quite a few different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; elements and include a large dose of what you would most like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see, do what you can to weave it into a unity and then look for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tools and memes to encourage it to come into being?  Is this all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a rational process or are only rational tools such as science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and logic allowed in forming the vision and in encouraging it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into reality?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think perhaps you underestimate the powers of rationality.  Perhaps you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have, in your life, drawn on spirituality in places where I have learned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to draw on rationality.  I hope not.  As far as I'm concerned, I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieved what I've achieved because of my determination to always walk the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; path of rationality, including in places where rationality is not commonly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used because it looks a little difficult.  And the reason is that I had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough past experience to predict that even if the path of rationality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looked a little difficult, sticking to the problem and not giving up at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first glance would yield results eventually.  So far, this strategy has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always paid off really big.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I understand and very much appreciate this.  But I think that on
<br>
examination there is more to this rationality of yours than what
<br>
many delimit the term to.  Spirituality, true spirituality, also
<br>
requires this kind of rigourous honesty and not shrinking from
<br>
the problem.  Spirituality is not at odds with rationality but
<br>
can underly and extend beyond it (or at least what most mean by
<br>
it). 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In particular, rationality has the power to judge which &quot;arational&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elements of the mind are important, whether or not they're too dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be used, and where their place is in the larger scheme of things.  One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the things I really object to is the idea that rationality is somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;incomplete&quot;, that there's something outside rationality that has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power to dictate whether I should be rational, rather than the other way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around.  I've simply never found anything like this.  I've never found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything even close.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I would tend to use the word &quot;Reason&quot; here more than rationality
<br>
but I understand your point.  When you formed the goal of
<br>
devising a means for dealing with the coming Singularity that
<br>
would limit the amount of suffering and enable the most to
<br>
survive it, do you think that formulating that goal itself came
<br>
only from rationality or did it come from a deeper valuing core
<br>
of yourself that used rationality as the very best means to
<br>
acheive this?  What is that deeper part? 
<br>
<p>There are moments when the reason/rationality is not discarded
<br>
but where the reasoning mind simply rests and seeks and awaits
<br>
apprehension of that which is deeper by means different from
<br>
those employed by reason.   
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; What I have found, though, is that rationalizers and rationalizations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all kind are very fond of making this claim, with respect to flawed ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of thinking that my rational mind can easily understand, encompass,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visualize, and accurately predict.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is most certainly true that many do this.  But this does not
<br>
mean that there is nothing beyond rationality or of a deeper
<br>
type than what is generally conceived of as rationality.  There
<br>
are levels, if you will, of rationality that are different than
<br>
what most people mean by that.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Religions are great tools for weaving visions.  For good and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ill.  They are also quite good for cohering societies devoted at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different levels to common goals.  And I believe some of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; systems have quite a lot to say about letting go of your current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mental/emotional lockstep and redefining and reintegrating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; yourself.  This is a very important skill for what most of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; contemplate doing and becoming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, I use rationality for that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You use rationality and again, something that you include in
<br>
rationality that is beyond what I think many mean by the term.  
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Even so, I wouldn't want to be religious because, to my mind, it's better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to be rational and strive to improve that rationality than to do something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that has short-term benefits but is crippling in the long term.  But what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm asking for here is an example of even a short-term cognitive benefit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and by that I mean &quot;coming up with a right answer&quot;, and not alleged lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; stress levels and so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Isn't this a bit circular?  You say it is better to be rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and improve that rationality but exactly what is that to you and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what do you use to validate that conclusion as best?  What makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you believe that all spirituality/religion is crippling in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; long term?  In point of fact it seems not to be so for many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spiritual/religious-ly inclined people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do they still believe wrong things?  Are they ready to give up those wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs if they are disproved?  Or are they more likely to doubt the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (correct) disproof and even begin to inveigh against the Bayesian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Probability Theorem itself?  It is this perniciously self-protective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quality that I refer to as &quot;crippling&quot; because it results in people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digging themselves deeper into their holes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There are many levels of human beings.  
<br>
<p>Some are always willing to examine and give up their
<br>
mis-comprehensions for better.  Some of these believe
<br>
rationality is the only or best tool for evaluating
<br>
comprehensions and some do not think it necessarily is or
<br>
believe there are other tools also needed.
<br>
<p>Some are caught in particular thought, pschological and social
<br>
forms that they have identified so strongly with that they find
<br>
it very difficult to even consider changing.  Some of these also
<br>
consider rationality/science as they comprehend it as the only
<br>
or best way, some not. 
<br>
<p>But as many of all types as possible need to as much as possible
<br>
be given a positive vision of what is to come and some means of
<br>
helping it come into being.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Is the 'right answer&quot; the only thing important?  I growing into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a saner, more caring, more generous person of less worth than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; getting some cognitive &quot;right answer&quot;?  Is living life with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inner calmness even in the midst of the most strenuous and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hectic activity so worthless that that without any extra &quot;right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; answer&quot; is of no worth?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I use rationality for that, too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have lived my life according to the principle that if you pursue the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right answers, other things come to you; if you pursue other things at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expense of truth, then you will simply wind up building stronger and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stronger shackles for yourself, and you will achieve neither truth nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those other goals that were so important to you.
</em><br>
<p><p>I know you do and I deeply honor and respect the way and the
<br>
incredible extent to which you do that.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
If you will forgive my saying so, you are a profoundly spiritual
<br>
man.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My answer, then, is that I don't know whether &quot;correctly modeling the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Universe&quot; is the ultimate meaning of life, but I very definitely know that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correctly modeling the Universe is important to protecting this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization as it heads into Singularity, and even without that, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still never step aside from the path of correctly modeling the Universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if it made me temporarily happy, because I would fear that by doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so, I was destroying a part of my own potential.
</em><br>
<p>That is profoundly moral.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that the best thing I can do to protect the potential of others is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to encourage them to use self-criticizing systems like rationality, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argue against any suggestion that some other system is somehow &quot;outside&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality.  In practice, the sole use of that belief is always to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protect mental wrongnesses from healthy ways of thinking.  Of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mental cancers want to avoid the slings and arrows that are sent their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way, so of course people who haven't learned to think painful thoughts are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very happy with the idea that their pet theories are magically immune to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the discomforts that are being provided by their own innate intuitions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external sources such as scientists.  But I view discomforting intuitions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as part of a healthy mind, and discomforting scientists as part of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; healthy society.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree that saying there is something deeper than reason
<br>
itself is solely to protect wrong thinking.  There are simply
<br>
places in the fabric of truth and of deep value that cannot be
<br>
reached by reason alone.  But as a very dedicated jnana yogi,
<br>
one who takes reason to its utmost limits and through reason
<br>
will go even beyond those limits (whether you realize it or
<br>
not), I know you will find that out for yourself.  
<br>
<p>Only very young beings think that no discomfort is involved in
<br>
becoming fully whole, alive and plugged into the fabric of Being
<br>
and Becoming or that their is some shortcut that will be as
<br>
satisfying.
<br>
<p>Scientists are not the only source of healthy and necessary
<br>
discomfort.
