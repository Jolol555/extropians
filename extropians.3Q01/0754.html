<em>&gt;Parrondo's paradox shows that you can win at two losing games by switching
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between them. The result has surprising implications for the origins of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;After a startling run-up, the stocks of Internet and technology companies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have suffered a precipitous decline in the past year. A portfolio equally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invested in such technology giants as America Online, Dell Computer, Lucent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Technologies and Qualcomm, Inc., would have lost half its value between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;March 1 and December 1, 2000.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But investors can remain fully invested in the market and make money even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they own only poorly performing stocks - provided their portfolio includes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;several different losers. On the surface, it might seem that if owning one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sinking stock were a bad idea, owning several would be insane.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mathematicians, physicists and biologists have proved otherwise.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The key to such a counterintuitive investment strategy is to take advantage
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of random fluctuations in the prices of the stocks from day to day and from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;week to week. Even though all the general trends may be downward, the price
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of virtually any declining stock can also rally briefly if the market
</em><br>
<em>&gt;momentarily believes the stock is cheap enough to buy. If investors can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manage to sell that stock during the brief price uptick that results from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such market demand, and then shift those funds to another stock that is in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;slump, they can overcome the general losing trends in both stocks. It is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an unproblematic strategy to pull off - transaction fees could gobble up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;profits, or a crash could drop prices monotonically for every stock in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;portfolio. Yet the alternative, holding on to a losing stock as its value
</em><br>
<em>&gt;progressively slips away, offers no winning possibility at all, and could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lead to far greater losses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No one yet has found a foolproof way to play such odds profitably and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reliably with a real losing stock portfolio. But it turns out, in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surprising number of circumstances, that it is quite possible to, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;essence, &quot;time the market.&quot; In other words, even when one is faced with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;number of scenarios for which the odds of success are unfavorable - whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in games of chance, in choosing between competing political parties or in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circumstances involving the second law of thermodynamics - it is possible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;play two of the scenarios against each other to create a single winning
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strategy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The workings of that paradoxical result were elucidated recently by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Spanish physicist Juan M.R. Parrondo of Complutensian University in Madrid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Parrondo showed that what was once an obscure curiosity in physics could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relevant to daily life - and much more besides. Some investigators think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Parrondo's paradox may hold the key to certain biological processes -and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perhaps to the development of life itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Brownian Motion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Parrondo, as I have implied, was not THE FIRST to notice the paradox that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bears his name. In 1992 the French physicists Armand Ajdari of the Paris
</em><br>
<em>&gt;School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry and Jacques Prost of the Curie
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Institute, also in Paris, discovered a microscopic engine that possesses an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unusual property. If left on, the engine pushes particles to the left, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if turned on and off repeatedly, the engine moves particles to the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instead. The engine, which is now known as a flashing ratchet, operates by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exploiting the random jiggling of particles known as Brownian motion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In 1827 the English botanist Robert Brown observed that microscopic pollen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grains suspended in water are in constant, chaotic motion. Those motions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the by-product of ceaseless random collisions with individual water
</em><br>
<em>&gt;molecules. Each individual particle - the invisible water molecules as well
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as the pollen grains visible in the microscope - acts in strict accordance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with Newton's laws of mechanics. Yet taken together, the motions of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particles are so diverse as to be effectively random. Predicting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behavior of particles subject to the bumps and grinds of so many collisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is as frustrating and, ultimately, impossible, as predicting the outcome of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a random coin toss.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Investigators frequently treat Brownian motion as noise, regarding it as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;undesirable but unavoidable by-product of any machine that does useful work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the molecular scale. Engineers, however, have recently harnessed the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;randomness of Brownian motion to generate orderly movement. Machines that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can bring about such directed motions are known as Brownian ratchets, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;named for the simple mechanical device that combines an asymmetric sawtooth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wheel and a spring-loaded pawl, or rocker arm, to restrict rotary motion to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one direction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In a mechanical ratchet, the pawl follows the contour of the toothed wheel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The teeth themselves are gently sloped on one side, and the pawl is mounted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so that it slides smoothly over them when the wheel turns in one direction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On the other side of the teeth, however, the points fall away sharply, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that when a force tries to spin the wheel in the opposite direction, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pawl jams against a tooth, preventing the wheel from turning. Thus even when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the ratchet is subject to forces that would move the wheel back and forth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the action of the pawl and the teeth allows the wheel to move in only one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;direction. Such asymmetry is also an essential part of the design of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Brownian ratchets, including the one that inspired Parrondo's paradox.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;To see how a group of objects in random motion can be ratcheted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;preferentially in one direction over another, imagine a collection of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;electrically charged particles distributed randomly along a gentle slope.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Assume the particles are all in Brownian, random motion, which makes them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;jiggle with equal probability to the right and to the left along that line,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with a slight drift leftward, say, down the slope. One can then superpose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;along the slope an electric potential that looks much like the teeth of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;saw: periodic energy peaks rise steeply on the left side of the tooth and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;descend gently down its right side. (Engineers have built such potentials,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for example, by depositing asymmetric electrodes along a line and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;running a current through them.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When current is turned off in such an apparatus, the charged particles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simply jiggle in place along the line, with only a slight net downward
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drift. When the current is turned on, however, and the sawtooth potential is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imposed, the particles are drawn toward the points of lowest energy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clumping together in the troughs of the potential.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now switch the current off a second time, so that the particles resume their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;random Brownian jiggling. Since the troughs of the potential are offset to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the right, as the particle drifts, it has a better chance of crossing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;peak of the potential to its immediate right than the one to its immediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;left. Switch the current on a second time, and most of the particles that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drifted to the left will be swept back into the same trough from which they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;started. But some of the particles that drifted to the right will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drifted so far that they will be drawn to the next trough over. If such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;potential is switched on and off, or &quot;flashed,&quot; at the proper frequency, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;charged particles in the flashing ratchet will march up the slope,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overcoming gravity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Flashing Ratchet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Although investigators could model the flashing ratchet mathematically, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematics for doing so is formidable. The complexity of the problem madeit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;appealing only to a small coterie of physicists and mathematicians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;We've known for several years that there was this really counterintuitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phenomenon in physics,&quot; says Charles R. Doering, a mathematician at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who coined the term &quot;flashing ratchet&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the mid-1990s. &quot;Parrondo's insight was to formulate the flashing ratchet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in terms of games, which everyone can understand.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since the motions of microscopic particles are as random as a coin toss,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Parrondo knew he could translate the mechanics of the flashing ratchet into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the language of game theory - and in the process reduce its mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;content to simple fractions. &quot;I thought that it would be really nice to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explain something so surprising just with three simple numbers, such as 1/2,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;3/4 and 1/10,&quot; says Parrondo. &quot;I love simple things.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Parrondo invented two coin-tossing games to embody the essential elements of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the flashing ratchet, and summoned his collaborator, the engineer Derek
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Abbott of the University of Adelaide in Australia, who was delighted with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Parrondo's innovation. Together, they worked through the details over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;coffee, scribbling on napkins in a Madrid café. One coin-tossing game would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be set up to mimic the Brownian motion of a particle on a slight incline
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when the potential of a flashing ratchet was turned off, providing a slow,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;steady drag on winnings. The second game would mimic the sawtooth bias of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the flashing ratchet with the potential turned on. When he got back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Australia, Abbott and his colleague Gregory P. Harmer began computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simulations to see what would happen if they played the games a hundred
</em><br>
<em>&gt;times. Sure enough, when they played either one of the games for a long
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time, they lost steadily.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The outcome of a single coin toss in either of the two games is identical:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;win the toss and gain a dollar, lose the toss and give back a dollar. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;player begins with some random number of dollars. In the first game the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;player tosses a coin weighted so that the odds of winning are slightly less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than 50 percent. In the second game two weighted coins are in play: the odds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of winning with the first coin are nearly 75 percent in the player's favor;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the odds of winning with the second coin are less than 10 percent. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;player gets to toss the favorable coin whenever his pool of money is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;multiple of three. He must toss the unfavorable coin whenever his pool of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;money is a multiple of three.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is obvious that the first game is a loser, but the long-term bias against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the player in the second game takes a bit of explanation. Since the chances
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are two-to-one against beginning the game with a quantity of dollars that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a multiple of three, most players would begin with the coin weighted in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their favor. Only in one start out of three would the player have to begin
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the coin weighted heavily against him. So on the initial toss, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rough odds of winning are: (2/3 x 0.75) + (1/3 x 0.1) or about 53 percent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Think of it as a &quot;new customer bonus.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Play the second game long enough, however, and it becomes no longer true
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the pool of money is divisible by three just a third of the time. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;player whose pool of money is not a multiple of three tends to increase his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;earnings by a dollar with each coin toss, until the earnings reach a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;multiple of three. But any dollar amount divisible by three creates a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt;barrier to advancement - 90 percent of the time a loss results. Hence after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the first few plays the pool spends most of its time bouncing between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amounts divisible by three and amounts just one dollar less. Although the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;random nature of the game means that for a single run of tosses the end
</em><br>
<em>&gt;result could be a tidy profit, play the second game enough times (Harmer and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Abbott ran 50,000 simulations of 100 tosses each on their computer) and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trend shows up clearly as a gradual but inexorable loss.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Once the pool gets stuck at or just below some multiple of three, it proves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difficult to extract oneself simply by playing the second game. But Parrondo
</em><br>
<em>&gt;saw that switching to the first game was a way to jump out of that rut.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Although the chances of raising one's earnings above a given multiple of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;three with two coin tosses are a measly 7 percent in the second game, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chances of doing so are nearly 25 percent in the first game. And once on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other side of that &quot;energy barrier,&quot; switching back to the second game gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good odds of increasing the pot to the next multiple of three.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Alternating between the two games - two coin tosses in the first game
</em><br>
<em>&gt;followed by two coin tosses in the second game - turns two losing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;propositions into one winning strategy. Again, the results of executing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strategy on any single run of tosses can vary wildly, but over the course of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;50,000 runs of 100 tosses each, the simulations showed a trend for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;substantial gains. Remarkably, even when the switches between games were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;made at random, the overall gains were similar.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;With Parrondo's strategy, a player can extract money from an opponent at no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cost - &quot;money for free,&quot; in the words of Abbott and Harmer. And with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;microscopic Brownian ratchets, there seems to be a similar magic at work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;After all, the random motion of molecules in solution - analogous to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;random outcomes of a coin flip - is translated into a steady flow in one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;direction. But there is a catch: the second law of thermodynamics. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;second law states that a mechanical system cannot give rise to more order
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than is fed into it. In his discussion of the second law in his famous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lecture series, the physicist Richard P. Feynman whimsically suggested that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a microscopic ratchet-and-pawl system attached to a highly sensitive wind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vane might draw enough energy from the random motion of air molecules in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;room to winch up a flea. Feynman decided that his setup would violate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;second law of thermodynamics - it would be a perpetual motion machine. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machine might indeed hoist the flea, he concluded, except that if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machine were really built on the molecular scale, the spring, too, would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subject to Brownian fluctuations, and so it would lift at random times. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ratchet could then turn in both directions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;At first glance, the flashing ratchet also appears to defy the second law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But a closer look shows that here there is an outside source of order acting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the system: the energy needed to switch the potential on and off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Brownian ratchets do not provide energy for free; like all motors, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;merely convert one form of order, such as chemical or electromagnetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;energy, into another form: directed motion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But Brownian ratchets are unique in that noise is not a drawback for them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but rather an essential ingredient. Many physicists had assumed that random
</em><br>
<em>&gt;motions would always hinder, not assist a machine; after all, random
</em><br>
<em>&gt;molecular motions are the essence of the disorderly state toward which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;second law of thermodynamics inexorably pulls. But the flashing ratchet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shows that such an assumption is unwarranted by the second law: the device
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would fail entirely if there were no Brownian motion to randomize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;positions of the particles when the potential is turned off. &quot;Noise is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generally thought of as something undesirable, something to get rid of or to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;filter away,&quot; the biochemist Martin Bier of the University of Chicago has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;written. &quot;To think of noise as something to exploit is a major shift of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paradigm.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Playing the Market
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Interestingly, people already exploit switching strategies similar to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Parrondo's in everyday life - though not, of course, because they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;applying theoretical insights about Brownian motion. But whenever someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;changes jobs to get a salary increase, for instance, or sells peaking stocks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and buys slumping ones, Parrondo's paradox comes into play. Moreover, many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ordinary events are governed by random-seeming fluctuations, from the ups
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and downs of the financial markets to the succession of political parties in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power. Economists and mathematicians have begun to ask whether the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principles of Parrondo's paradox could apply to decision making in those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;realms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The physicist Sergei Maslov of Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has shown that principles similar to Parrondo's paradox can be applied to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the stock market. Maslov found a way that the value of a stock portfolio can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increase even if all of its stocks decline in the long run: The entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;portfolio must be sold periodically - even daily - and the proceeds must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quickly plowed back into repurchasing the stocks in the same proportions as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they were in the original portfolio. The net effect of such periodic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rebalancing is to apply the gains from stocks that are doing temporarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better than average (and have therefore increased their relative proportion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the portfolio) to buy more stocks that are temporarily underachieving.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The beauty of Maslov's proposal is that one need not know anything about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particular stocks; simply sell them all and then buy them back in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rebalanced portfolio. Unless the balance of investments is shifted in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way, the long-term prospects for a portfolio full of duds are &quot;grim indeed,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;says Maslov, since all of the stocks tend to decline with time. But Maslov's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tactic can generate better returns than the &quot;buy and hold&quot; policy that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the current favorite of many economists. (It should be noted, however, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the declines in technology stocks mentioned at the beginning of this article
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might well overcome even Maslov's strategy.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Abbott and Parrondo suggest that switching from one option to another could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;also prove useful in applying government policies to quantities that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fluctuate unpredictably; for example, if two policies each cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unemployment to rise, alternating between them might actually create jobs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Furthermore, Abbott notes, citizens could be, in essence, following
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Parrondo's principles when they vote political parties alternately into and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out of office.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In short, Parrondo's paradox demonstrates that two wrongs can sometimes make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a right - and that a little indecision can be a good thing. &quot;One message of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Parrondian philosophy is to not be a moderate or an extremist, but to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maintain a dynamic between positions that may appear to be conflicting,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Abbott notes. &quot;Parrondo gives us permission to be 'swing voters' in life's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decisions.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As powerful as the insights of Parrondo's paradox may be at the macroscopic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;level, randomly switching from one &quot;game&quot; to another may have its greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impact at the microscopic scale. In the past few years engineers working
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with such tools as lasers and microscopic electrodes have built ratchets to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a degree of precision that would have been unimaginable just fifteen years
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ago. Such microscopic ratchets can work with objects of a truly molecular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;size - less than one-hundred-thousandth the size of Feynman's fleas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The chemists Steven G. Boxer and Alexander van Oudenaarden of Stanford
</em><br>
<em>&gt;University have found that minuscule ratchets can sift through the jumble of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proteins, lipids and carbohydrates that make up cell membranes. The two
</em><br>
<em>&gt;investigators observed that the ratchet allows particles to pass through it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at different speeds, depending on their size and electrical charge. That
</em><br>
<em>&gt;property makes it possible to sort membrane molecules simply by passing them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through a ratchet. Sorting membrane molecules could, in turn, become an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;important step in understanding just how particular drugs attach them-selves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to receptors in cell membranes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Nature Exploits Brownian Ratchets
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Even as engineers are developing the technology to build and use minuscule
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Brownian motors, biologists are beginning to suspect that nature has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exploiting the properties of intricately designed Brownian ratchets since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the beginnings of life. The ability to convert energy into directed motion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is vital to living creatures; people, for instance, depend crucially on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;muscular contractions that pump blood, draw breaths and move arms and legs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On a much smaller scale, cellular motors perform such chores as transporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organelles. The fuel for those motors is well known - the chemical energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stored in the molecule adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. But the inner
</em><br>
<em>&gt;workings of the motors themselves remain enigmatic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Some investigators have proposed recently that so-called motor proteins,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which haul microscopic cargo, might operate in part by a ratchet mechanism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In 1993 a team of engineers at Harvard University and the Rowland Institute
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for Science in Cambridge, Massachusetts, tracked the movements of the motor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protein kinesin. That protein moves by propelling itself along cellular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;train tracks&quot; called microtubules, and can transport cargo more than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hundred times its size - much like an ant carrying an enormous cake crumb.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The team discovered that instead of moving smoothly along the microtubule,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kinesin makes distinct jumps, each about eight nanometers long, as if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were climbing the rungs of a ladder.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Those discrete jumps led Martin Bier and Dean Astumian, a colleague of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bier's at the University of Chicago, to hypothesize that a ratchet-like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;engine was at work. The microtubule, they proposed, could be electrically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;charged to resemble the sawtooth potential of the flashing ratchet. When the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kinesin molecule is at rest, they suggested, it prefers to stay in one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the troughs of the potential. But when ATP is burned, the kinesin molecule
</em><br>
<em>&gt;temporarily gains enough energy to escape the trough. Brownian motion makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it drift a little to the right or left, so that when the momentary burst of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;energy subsides, the kinesin molecule may slide down into the nearest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neighboring trough - say, to the right. Occasionally, the molecule may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instead shift to the nearest neighboring trough on the left, but as with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;flashing ratchet, the combination of jiggling motion and the shape of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sawtooth should give rise to a net long-term movement to the right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Astumian and Bier calculated the power output of such a ratchet, and their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;estimates came within an order of magnitude of the measurements made by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Harvard and Rowland Institute team. Since that time, several other models
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have been suggested that fit even more closely with experimental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;observation. Each model exploits a Brownian ratchet engine, along with other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mechanisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Engineers hope that the mechanism of kinesin action,when finally understood,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will provide the blueprints for minute, man-made motors that could be useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in microelectronic devices. &quot;Ion pumps and motor proteins are the smallest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;engines we know and they can no longer be thought of as wind-up toys,&quot; Bier
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has written. &quot;If nano-technological devices are to be as efficient and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reliable as biological molecules a good understanding of noise will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indispensable to their design.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Beyond explaining the inner workings of living creatures, some investigators
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggest that Parrondo's paradox may hold the key to explaining one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;oldest puzzles of nature: how life began. One central problem is to explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how the inchoate, randomly jiggling mass of particles that physicists call
</em><br>
<em>&gt;primordial soup could give rise to the complex molecules of life. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Parrondo's paradox demonstrates that processes leading to net losses can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;combined to generate a positive outcome, and that randomness can facilitate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that outcome. Abbott suggests that a mechanism such as the flashing ratchet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might have harnessed forces that would otherwise have led to disorder, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;channeled them toward the assembly of complex amino acids. Put in a slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different way, processes that would, if left to themselves, tear up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;molecules essential to the chemistry of life, might have worked together
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instead to foster the synthesis of such molecules.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thus perhaps the emergence of order is not as unlikely as it has often
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seemed. The physicist Paul C.W. Davies, who examined the question of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life began in his book The Fifth Miracle, has observed:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Nobody knows what the process was, but anything that clarifies how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information and organized complexity can emerge from the randomness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;molecular chaos will cast welcome light on this most profound of scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mysteries. That is the significance of Parrondo's paradox, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;associated work of people like Derek Abbott.
