<p>If done wrong, yes. Sometimes valid arguments are raised for selfish or
<br>
incorrect reasons. But given that most of the anti globalisation arguments
<br>
used by (say) unions and xenophobes are hollow and in themselves possible
<br>
to disprove, the selfishness of their arguing helps undermine them.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; * For arguments to work, they must be understandable. Expressing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; benefits of free trade, free movement of people, open societies and so on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in a way that *anyone* can understand is a huge challenge that should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; met. Well crafted arguments may of course cut through a lot of rigid belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; systems, but they are hard to create. It is better to aim at &quot;the middle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ground&quot;, the large population of people not strongly polarized but not very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; knowledgeable and get them to learn about these ideas. That can help create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a culture that can absorb more advanced arguments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Free trade and free movement are fine and good.  Being convicted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here for breaking a law passed by a government on the other side
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the world that I have no representation within and which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might run on totally different principles than any I have agreed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to is not at all fine.  Yet such things have been proposed as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of &quot;globalization&quot;.   
</em><br>
<p>Which only goes to show that the word is being used for far too much. A lot
<br>
of the treaties being made by WTO and G8 are far too mercantilistic or
<br>
threatens the open society. No need to be on just one side of the current
<br>
polarization, as long as we have a self-consistent view of what we are
<br>
trying to achieve. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; * Aim at the intellectuals. As Hayek pointed out (I know Waldemar and I are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; starting to sound like a broken record about this) in _The Intellectuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and Socialism_, if you can get the memes into the intellectual strata of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society, they they will spread much more efficiently and affect other parts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of society. This requires a lot of dedicated work, but eventually it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be worth it (as socialism demonstrated).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To be cynical, I think it was Lenin who was happy to have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectuals make the space for the revolution but promplty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggested they be done away with as soon thereafter as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible. 
</em><br>
<p>Not just him. But if you look at how socialism and other ideologies with
<br>
pervasiveness have spread, it is due to the intellectuals. We have a far
<br>
different view of how useful they are in the long run, though.
