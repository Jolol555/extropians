<p>Not really, all that is needed is that there be consequences to states
<br>
for not enforcing the standards already adopted. We've seen this before
<br>
here in the US: prior to the civil war, each state ran its own business
<br>
unhampered by the US Constitution, and was not obligated to respect the
<br>
bill of rights. It was commonly seen that this bill was only for the
<br>
feds to respect. It wasn't until we had the civil war and enacted the
<br>
14th amendment that this issue was enforced among all the states. The
<br>
existence of the 14th amendment didn't mandate that the federal
<br>
government take over all functions previously attributed to the states,
<br>
it merely said that the states had to respect the rights of its citizens
<br>
to a common standard.
<br>
<p>Similarly, we don't need a world government to eliminate national
<br>
governments, it merely needs to make sure that national governments
<br>
respect some common standard.
