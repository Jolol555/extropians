<em>&gt; Objectively, terrorism does not pose a significant risk to the life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the average American.  Over 6,000 people die every day in the US.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We'd have to have a WTC disaster at least every couple of weeks in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to significantly affect overall mortality rates.
</em><br>
<p>I was having a very similar conversation with some of my coworkers
<br>
yesterday. Examining the roots of our (societal) complete disregard for the
<br>
6000/day -- each of which is a personal tragedy for someone -- compared to
<br>
the reactions to current events is enlightening. I'm thinking about writing
<br>
something on that topic for the Longevity Meme. If anyone else want to beat
<br>
me to it, please let me know; I'd like to publish it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't mean to say that we should be callous about death.  But rather,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we should recognize that we are surrounded by death.  Over a hundred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousand people die every day, many of them unnecessarily even by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today's standards.  It's an inconceivable tragedy.  Just being alive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today, we face horrors from which I believe future generations will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shrink in disbelief.  Given this reality, the additional increment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering a few terrorists can impose is relatively small.  We should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not give them too much weight.
</em><br>
<p>This is exactly the point I wish to make; waking people up to this
<br>
perception is one of the first goals of the Longevity Meme. If we could just
<br>
make that connection in mainstream society/media between the numbers and
<br>
shock and the need to do something about aging on as grand a scale as
<br>
possible. It's like grasping at soap, trying to make the ends meet.
