<em>&gt;&gt; It would remain to be proven that such taxes actually reflect

externalities.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; But even so, the libertarian way of dealing with externalities is through
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; property rights and voluntary agreement -- not through taxes.  See, e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Roy Cordato's _Welfare Economics and Externalities in an Open Ended
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Universe_ and Robert Ellickson's _Order Without Law: How Neighbors Settle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Disputes_.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ultimately, in the anarcho-capitalist end of the libertarian spectrum,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would be correct. However, the only recognizable difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a libertarian government and a libertarian ungoverned territory is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you will have to deal with various insurance providers who will mitigate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this, i.e. only a difference of monopoly versus free market providers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; externalities mitigation.
</em><br>
<p>Not so.  Cordato's arguments apply both to minarchy and anarchy -- in fact,
<br>
to any-archy as they are not libertarian arguments per se, but economic
<br>
ones.  Specifically, he talks about how attempts to improve upon free market
<br>
efficiency are doomed.  (I don't want to go his whole book and just suggest
<br>
you read it, then we can discuss it.  This is not to say I agree with every
<br>
last sentence in the work.  I just think it will require too much effort for
<br>
me to type all the things I do find illuminating in this context in here.
<br>
Plus, while this is signal to you and I, it's probably noise to most others
<br>
on the list.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; (Note for those who don't know what externalities are:  They are costs or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; benefits passed on to others without their consent.  Usually, the ones of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; interest are negative externalities -- i.e., costs passed onto to other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; without their consent.  An example is air pollution.  People usually
</em><br>
don't
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; complain about positive externalities.  An example is someone beautifying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; their property.  This might provide benefits to his or her neighbors --
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; terms of property value increase, a more esthetically pleasing
</em><br>
neighborhood,
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and the like.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a libertarian context, if, for example, I improve my property, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could go to each of my neighbors that would benefit from my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvements, and say: &quot;either pay your share of the value of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvement, or sign this waiver of your right to litigate against my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvements, or we go to court&quot; (obviously in a more polite manner than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this).
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the libertarian context -- anarchist or minarchist -- would be
<br>
this.  If someone changes his or her property, that's his or her business
<br>
unless someone else can _prove_ the changes caused them actual physical
<br>
externalities.  (Obviously, if neighbors want to get along, as Ellickson
<br>
argues they often do, especially the longer they live near each other, then
<br>
other types of externalities might come into play.)  Improvements that cause
<br>
pecuniary and other externalities are not the scope of government or of
<br>
rights theory per se.  (I would argue that the other category here is not
<br>
even part of rights theory and, therefore, has nothing to do with rights.)
<br>
<p>Only in the case of some other contractual agreements -- such as CCC&amp;Rs in
<br>
many private communities existing today -- would anyone have the right to
<br>
involve themselves in such disputes.  Of course, anyone can sue anyone, BUT
<br>
a truly libertarian court system would, in principle, throw out such cases
<br>
and the costs of litigation would then be recoverable from those who
<br>
_falsely_ litigate.
<br>
<p>Also, positive externalities are either norecoverable or else disappear for
<br>
other reasons.  In the former case, my using a standard, such as the English
<br>
language in America, creates positive externalities in the usual sense,
<br>
since it creates benefits for others by my sticking to it.  I.e., they can
<br>
better understand me.  Yet I can't charge everyone for my accrual of value
<br>
to them.  Ditto for using money, peaceable behavior, and the like.
<br>
<p>In the latter, I can stop doing the activity that creates value for others
<br>
unless they help me out with the cost.
<br>
<p>In either case, no one's forcibly taking value away from me, ergo, no rights
<br>
are violated.  Ergo, there's no case for a suit in a libertarian society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This claim needs a lot more justification than that.  How would a
</em><br>
government
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; find out what really were externalities?  (Would it be able to determine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this any better than the market?  If so, how?  If it could do this, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; submit, it would be a case for socialism.  Not that that's bad in itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but it makes me think it's not possible.)  How would it find out their
</em><br>
exact
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; amount?  (If it charged more, it would be aggressing.  If it charged
</em><br>
less,
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; then, by your standards, it would be allowing aggression.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, for example, gasoline makers/sellers would have to pay the cost of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CO2 mitigation, which they could pass on to their customers however they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wished:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) flat rate per gallon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) graduated amount based on the vehicles own consumption and emissions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Similarly, roads could all be privatized today with remote smartcard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology paying tolls to road owners remotely, or simply collected by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an autoclub / road cooperative based on the vehicle's milage. Vehicles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which do not provide milage data or billing information get stopped by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private cops until they provide a billing address and/or insurance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provider that checks out, and failure to pay results in vehicle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impoundment.
</em><br>
<p>This is not similarly.  Private roads would be a totally different and,
<br>
IMHO, much better system.  The road owners themselves can then decide who to
<br>
let ride on them.  Some might, e.g., not require such insurance or have
<br>
patrols or care about carbon dioxide emissions.
<br>
<p>Others might then ask or sue them for damages IF they can prove their
<br>
activity causes harm to them.  (The burden of proof would be on the
<br>
plaintiff here.)  In either case, the matter would be privately solved
<br>
without the need of a tax.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remember, libertarians society DOES NOT lack coersion, it simply applies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coersion to those who attempt to initiate it themselves. Self defense is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified in all situations.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, except for immediate self-defense, those in a libertarian society
<br>
should only use coercion in retaliation.  E.g., if you stole my PC, I could
<br>
use force to get it you to pay damages.  (George H. Smith. 1991. &quot;Justice
<br>
Entrepreneurship in a Free Market&quot; in _Atheism, Ayn Rand, and Other
<br>
Heresies_ on how such use of force would probably best be regulated under
<br>
anarchism.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Even if it could overcome these very real knowledge problems, would its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; incentives be in the direction of actually limiting itself to this and
</em><br>
only
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We obviously cannot hash all of these things out here.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, but this argues in my favor.  Why?  Individuals in a libertarian
<br>
society can come to agreements, as in Ellickson's book (he uses historical
<br>
not hypothetical cases).  Governments work differently.  They must impose a
<br>
tax or a regulation from on high.  This sort of top down order _might_ be
<br>
good for some things -- perhaps enforcing general rules as Hayek would
<br>
argue -- but it cannot decide all the little things of everyday life.
<br>
That's where people voluntarily working things out does much better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Considering the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level to which insurance providers already deal with these sorts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems day in and out, I don't think this would be all that difficult.
</em><br>
<p>Insurance, to the degree they are not tools of the state, are acting in a
<br>
competitive market.  (Even at the level of not choosing to use insurance --
<br>
through ignorance, inability to pay, or planning around it.  Even in the
<br>
last case, the planning might be wrong.  I mgiht think -- and everyone else
<br>
might agree with me -- that I can cover the costs of certain damages, and we
<br>
all might totally wrong.)  The information they are dealing with is
<br>
disequilibrium information that they must discover for themselves.  Just
<br>
saying that they do this without saying how AND then assuming that
<br>
governments will have the same (or better?) information available to them
<br>
does not prove your point.
<br>
<p>Also, again, if you do think that because a market agent or group of them
<br>
can discover or create the necessary information that a government, too, can
<br>
do the same, they why not have full blown socialism?  After all, if
<br>
privately owned firms and individuals can [spontaneously] create a price
<br>
system, why not government?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The proper way of mitigating _negative_ externalities is through defining
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; property rights and through voluntary agreements.  E.g., if my next door
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; neighbor decides to throw a party that will interfere with my sleep, he
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I can come to an understanding that I'll have some warning and maybe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the music won't go past midnight.  (Or he might invite me over.  Not all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; problems are so easily solved, but force should not be the first line of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; problem solving in these cases.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, but this assumes the individual has all voluntary agreements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ironed out ahead of time,
</em><br>
<p>It does not assume that at all.  Just as, in a free market, not all prices
<br>
are worked out ahead of time -- no one or group has that knowledge; it does
<br>
not exist ex ante! -- but emerge through the process, so do such agreements
<br>
and arrangements.  I cannot know ahead of time if my neighbor is going to do
<br>
something that might disturb me, but I can react to it and he and I can come
<br>
to an agreement about what to do without need for taxes or such.  (This is
<br>
also in the context of living in society, where there are manifold
<br>
predictable behaviors already in place that we tacitly agree to.  For
<br>
example, the convenience store near me works under the assumption that
<br>
people won't just take the newspaper and run.:)
<br>
<p>In fact, I would argue that using government to take care of these problems
<br>
as you would with taxations leads to more problems then it solves because
<br>
that view assumes that government can &quot;iron out&quot; these things ahead of time
<br>
or spontaneously as they arise -- and all that to everyone's mutual benefit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or has the concientiousness to do so through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their PPL. When individuals go around blithely acting without such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreements set, they need to either provide a means to come to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreement, or else deal with force acting in self defense against their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own initiation of force, imposing externalities on people.
</em><br>
<p>Generally, people do come to such agreements as the need arises.  That's why
<br>
things like money (see Dowd's _Competition and Finance_ and his other works
<br>
on money and banking), markets (See the works of Hayek), and common law (see
<br>
Benson's _The Enterprise of Law: Justice Without the State_) evolve -- not
<br>
because government agents learned about modern (and flawed) welfare
<br>
economics and tried to apply Pareto optimal solutions through taxes.
