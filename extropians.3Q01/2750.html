I've wondered at times (this article made me remember) if there are any extropians who are &quot;futurists&quot; as in this organization.  Connections?  Disparities?  All the same caboodle?  One group more technologically/scientifically weighed than another?
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>We do have professionals among us like Robin Hanson(professor of economics), Robert Bradbury(biotech entrepreneur), and Anders Sandberg(commercial thinktank co-founder) who have published in academic journals and also done media appearances.
<br>
<p>And as for the &quot;marketing/anthropological&quot; futurist forecasters as was talked about in the article, I would say Max More and Anders Sandberg are prime examples of this.    
<br>
<p>The WFS is a much larger group then ExI, and has a more mainsteam image to the public.  I would say ExI has a much more insightful &quot;long view&quot; then the WFS.  Not to say the latter group is by any means overly conservative.  
<br>
<p>They have a magazine you can buy at local bookstores which I enjoy.  I have been reading it since I was a teenager.
<br>
<p>Even Anchorage, Alaska has a local chapter of the World Futurist Society.  Though a friend of mine warned me about possible socialist leanings. lol!  
<br>
<p>I need to finally actually attend a meeting before their ninety-one year old chapter president dies on me!  I have had some phone conversations with him and he is a cool guy.  Leon was quite fascinated by ExI and also cryonics.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
<br>
<p>P.S.  As I wrote this post my roommate's four year-old son is played with a robotic dog toy.  He is only mildly impressed by it, but I bet he would love a toy on the level of &quot;Teddy&quot; from the latest Spielberg effort.  Give technology time...
