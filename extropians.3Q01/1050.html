<em>&gt; &gt; I can't believe what I am reading.  You have enough knowledge

<em>&gt; Evidently she's not alone in thinking that someone my sentence

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do people possibly misread what I wrote?  J.R. and I were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primarily analyzing how *all sorts* of people have various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs.  Why, by &quot;false belief&quot; I definitely meant a belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarded as false by EVERYONE on this list!  Such beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist, you know!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So let me go on record as saying that I don't think that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is anything wrong with how any of the people on this list think.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks.  I needed the clarification.
