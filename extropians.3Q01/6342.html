<em>&gt;Not meaning to carp. Just saying, is all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So let's skip to the meat of the matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It started with boxcutters and the lower average level of terror that one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can match
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up with the implicit &quot;rules&quot; for hijackings most people here have taken

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;We can get out of this if we're careful; just take them where they want 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to go,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and do what they say.&quot; &quot;We can negotiate.&quot; ...et pitiful cetera.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;These mantras are no longer in effect; it has a certain clarifying effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Everyone keeps saying this isn't a movie, but they're partly wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The effectors of these sad events have put us in a Bruce Willis or Stephen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Segall scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or, maybe, Terminator.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Listen. And understand. That terminator is out there. It can't be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bargained with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And it absolutely  will  not  stop,  ever,  until  you  are  dead.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Which sucks. Sorry for the drama, but it's called for, for once. That 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;level of focus, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;use a neutral word, is necessary for success. Going the extra five minutes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The ability to deal deadly force on an instant's notice just got epsilon 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more valuable here
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the ol' US of A.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That sucks, too. But that's what's at issue here, not guns per se.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;MMB, who doesn't like vigilantes but likes terrorists just a skosh less...
</em><br>
<p>Quite right. My calls for careful thought and less than horrific end-games 
<br>
don't apply in the case of a hijacked airliner. The terrorists themselves 
<br>
have changed the rules there. If I was on a hijacked airliner now I would 
<br>
have absolutely no hesitation at doing my best at destroying/permanently 
<br>
disabling the hijackers, regardless of risk to my own life. The rules are 
<br>
now that they be stopped no matter what. Because your life is likely 
<br>
already forfeit, you no longer have anything to lose in such a situation.
<br>
<p>In considering against other countries however, the rules of good sense and 
<br>
being careful you don't cause yourself more grief further down the track 
<br>
still apply.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
