<em>&gt; &gt; If there is a problem, it's concentrated more in government (the PC ruling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; class) than in private industry (the working class). Most overpaid bosses are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in government, starting with the US president, who is paid millions and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; responsible for no identifiable product.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you sure of that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I remember correctly, the office of POTUS comes with a pathetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salary -- something like $140,000 a year. In comparison, the Prime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Minister of GB&amp;NI takes home about GBP 140,000; this is the _average_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salary for the CTO of a tech company in the UK, where most tech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies are relatively small and their executives are paid less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than their US equivalents. In many other countries the British PM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be considered badly paid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There was an incident in 1999 when Bill Clinton nearly had to declare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal bankruptcy; why do you think he's treading the lecture circuit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so eagerly?
</em><br>
<p>He was doing it long before that. Before he was out of office, his wife
<br>
had landed an $8.5 million book deal, and he had several million in the
<br>
bank already from 'fundraising' for not only his legal funds which
<br>
runneth over and above expenses, but for his presidential
<br>
library/pimp-pad as well as for his 'foundation' whose primary
<br>
beneficiary is WJC hisself. On top of that he landed most recently a $10
<br>
million book deal. All the while, the taxpayer is paying for his offices
<br>
in New York.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a general rule of thumb, government salaries are a pittance compared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to their private enterprise equivalents. This gives rise to a problem;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments can't get (and retain) highly competent staff in a competitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market, and those they do retain have an incentive to line their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pockets. The only people who _really_ make money out of government are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the contractors ...
</em><br>
<p>Depends on whether you are creative or not with your 'fundraising'. Note
<br>
that the McCain Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Act would make it
<br>
entirely legal for private citizens, groups, and corporations to donate
<br>
unlimited funds for senators, presidents, and congressmen to pay for the
<br>
operating expenses of their regular offices (just not their campaigns),
<br>
whereas today they are all limited in staff by law and funding by public
<br>
expenditures. Can you say legalized bribery?
