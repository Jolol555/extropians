not

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; term beyond any useful meaning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not really. You pay a gas tax when you buy gas. If you don't buy gas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you pay no gas tax. This applies to all sales taxes. Tolls paid at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highway toll booths are similar: they are use based taxes, and you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose to not use that which the tax is levied on. The registration fees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for your cars, boats, etc are also use based taxes.
</em><br>
<p>I don't disagree that these taxes exist now, but that they are not
<br>
voluntary.  Surely, I can choose not to buy a boat.  I can also choose not
<br>
to own a house to avoid direct real estate taxes, not to work to avoid
<br>
income taxes, not to buy or sell to avoid transaction taxes, not to invest
<br>
to avoid...  You get the picture?
<br>
<p>A libertarian take on this is it's still initiating force.  I can't choose
<br>
to buy tax free gas.  I can't choose to own real estate tax free.  Etc.  At
<br>
least, I can't avoid these things in any nontrivial sense.  (Yeah, I can
<br>
avoid doing these things or I can do them and risk police action.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A libertarian government properly focuses its revinue gathering on use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based taxation, while fascist governments focus on confiscatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxation.
</em><br>
<p>A libertarian government would not be able to tax period.  It might be able
<br>
to charge user fees, but these would be for services the government actually
<br>
delivers.  A government doesn't deliver a service by forcing people to pay a
<br>
tax.  This would include registration fees.  What if I don't want to
<br>
register?  (A libertarian government might disavow protecting, say, my car
<br>
against theft or vandalism if I don't register it, but it would not be able
<br>
to use force to make me register.)
<br>
<p>In this light, all taxation is confiscation.  It doesn't matter if it's a
<br>
tax labeled a fee or not.  The deciding factor between a tax and an actual
<br>
price (the market word for what people pay for something) is whether the
<br>
initiation of force is involved.
<br>
<p>That said, your semilibertarian -- and it is that: only partly
<br>
libertarian -- government might be better than what we have now in any place
<br>
on Earth, but it falls short of the principles you claim to be upholding.
<br>
It mgiht be a good interim setup, between today's welfare state and
<br>
tomorrow's libertarian society, but it should not be the goal.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
