<p>I know China has banned it, but that of course doesn't tell us much. The

opinions seem more mixed than in the west, likely because of less

monotheistic influence.

<p>Yes to both. A lot of people don't understand what it is about, so they
<br>
use the metaphors and concepts they know of - bad Hollywood films. And
<br>
the meme that the natural order is sacrosanct is very strong in our
<br>
culture. So you have a lot of people feeling that something weird,
<br>
dangerous and *bad* is going on. The problem is that it is not enough to
<br>
show them what is really going on, you have to deal with deep seated
<br>
values, and that is truly hard. 
<br>
<p>To quote a certain unpleasant but sometimes clearsighted imaginary
<br>
character:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hold life to be sacred, but we also know the foundation of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life consists in a stream of codes not so different from the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;successive frames of a watchvid. Why then cannot we cut one code
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short here, and start another there? Is life so fragile that it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can withstand no tampering? Does the sacred brook no improvement? 
<br>

<br>

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you insist that the human genetic code is &quot;sacred&quot; or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;taboo&quot;? It is a chemical process and nothing more. For that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matter -we- are chemical processes and nothing more. If you deny
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yourself a useful tool simply because it reminds you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uncomfortably of your mortality, you have uselessly and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pointlessly crippled yourself. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chairman Sheng-ji Yang 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Looking God in the Eye&quot; 
<br>
<p>Remember how hard it is to get people to accept cryonics or immortalism?
<br>
Even disregarding the technological troubles, the underlying message of
<br>
&quot;all your previous hard and painful efforts of coming to terms with
<br>
your mortality will become irrelevant or at least have to be redone&quot;.
<br>
That makes a lot of people to lash out or question immortalism, simply
<br>
because it both brings up painful mortality issues in an unfamiliar (and
<br>
hence unshielded) way and contradicts the natural order meme. 
<br>
<p><p>But the natural order gave us Dolly too...
