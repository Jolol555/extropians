</em><br>
<p>OK... that is the theory, now look at the practice. If companies worked 
<br>
upon purely economic lines then this might happen, but what actually 
<br>
happens is that management always forms cliques where the executives have a 
<br>
say in how much they are paid. Status and power play a very large part in 
<br>
such decisions. Many companies feel they have made a great coup if they can 
<br>
attract a VIP to their corporation... even if they are on the boards of a 
<br>
dozen other companies. (I don't believe anybody can successfully operate on 
<br>
the boards of more than a few companies.) This makes for great waste.
<br>
<p>Why don't these companies fail and the more efficient ones take over? 
<br>
Because in reality simple economics doesn't seem to matter much. Marketing 
<br>
and economies of scale seem to have more effect on profits than whether a 
<br>
company is good at what it does or not. (Economies of scale don't work 
<br>
really well in the information age so we may find this changing a little in 
<br>
future.)
<br>
<p>It is great to talk about a theoretically pure and free market... but it 
<br>
can't exist. We can only have degrees of freedom.
<br>
<p>Please note that I am NOT arguing that free markets are a hopelessly lost 
<br>
cause and we should give up on them -- I actually think they are very 
<br>
useful, so long as we don't focus entirely on the unattainable, pure, 
<br>
simple, theoretical version and lose sight of the practicality of the 
<br>
situation. Companies need to be regulated because they often operate 
<br>
without regard to human values. Governments, too, need to be regulated to 
<br>
ensure they don't operate without regard for the people they are meant to 
<br>
serve. These are simply feedback mechanisms. To remove feedback leads 
<br>
rapidly to things spiralling out of control, as we have seen so many times 
<br>
in the past.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;Your objections to free markets are more based on your philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opposition to it the to factual objections.
</em><br>
<p>No. Mine are practical concerns. I don't start from any philosophical base. 
<br>
I consider myself a technician. I never was taught the theoretical 
<br>
philosophies. I read a little of them but was never impressed by any of 
<br>
them because they all seem to make the same mistakes of losing sight of 
<br>
practical reality. I start from 3 simple values:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- life is valuable
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- intelligence is valuable
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- knowledge is valuable
<br>
My thoughts are based on practical concerns in trying to further those 3. I 
<br>
have no allegiance to any philosophy.
<br>
<p>I am not opposed to using free markets for what they can give us. I am 
<br>
opposed to corporations ushering in a new feudal society.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;You often hear in the media and by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people on the street the phrase &quot;The rich are getting rich and the poor are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;getting poorer&quot; this is not the case.  The Rich are getting richer, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;poor are as well.  Just look at the poverty level in the US right now and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compare it with the poverty level in the 1950's, and then in the early
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1900's, then to the poor farmers that made up 85% of the population in 1850.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Everyone lives longer healthier lives.  The rich are getting richer, but so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are the poor.  Its just the rich may get richer faster, but the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;global standard of living is increasing
</em><br>
<p>I agree almost completely... although next time I see a homeless kid, or a 
<br>
starving person (rare in Oz) I don't think I shall bother trying to 
<br>
convince him that he is better off than his ancestors. (I am not being 
<br>
sarcastic here -- I really do largely agree -- I am just cautioning that it 
<br>
doesn't apply across the board.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  and this is directly because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capitalistic competition.
</em><br>
<p>No. It is also due to people becoming smarter and well educated, more 
<br>
tolerant, and healthier. Capitalism has a part to play in that change, but 
<br>
beware of overstating its contribution.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;If there are people out there who want to be educated, there will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;companies out there willing to educate them, poor or not.  And they could do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it better, cheaper, and faster.
</em><br>
<p>If that was the case then that is what would happen. So why doesn't it? I 
<br>
don't have anything against private schooling. I think it would be 
<br>
wonderful if it became as cheap and accessible as public schooling 
<br>
currently is.
<br>
<p>Capitalism works very well if you are rich. If you are not then you need 
<br>
other means. The biggest mistake rich classes make is in supposing that 
<br>
they don't benefit from the poor improving their lot. If poorer people are 
<br>
helped out of deep poverty with access to wider society then the richer 
<br>
classes gain more smart minds (the most valuable resource of all), less 
<br>
disease, less violent crime.
<br>
<p>Pulling the plug on public schooling benefits nobody.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
