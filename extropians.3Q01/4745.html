<em>&gt; &gt; It was different between different nations, but many of the eugenics

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; various european nations were one result, for example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This thinking is not as extinct as some might think.
</em><br>
<p>True. But that doesn't make it *right*. In fact, it is very much against
<br>
the view of human autonomy implied by the extropian principles,
<br>
liberalism and humanism. Humans are responsible for themselves, and even
<br>
if others dislike their choices they have a right to make them as long
<br>
as their freedom doesn't interfere with the freedom of others. This
<br>
tends to get emotional when it comes to originating children, but the
<br>
same arguments that make it ethical within this framework to genetically
<br>
modify children also allows parents who have notable genetic flaws to
<br>
pass them on - it might be bad, but forbidding it or imposing force to
<br>
prevent it is far worse. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now does this small community
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a right to (i.e., do the people reading this agree that it's okay) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to seize this person, hospitalize him, and even sterilize him?  As a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; member of a small, rather isolated community typical of many in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history books, I would cautiously endorse such actions.
</em><br>
<p>I think the only case where this might be ethically acceptable from my
<br>
position would be if his agency was seriously hurt, i.e. he was not
<br>
acting as an autonomous person any more and the treatment would restore
<br>
his autonomy. Sure, drawing lines here is notoriously tricky, but it is
<br>
possible to do. Forcing autonomous persons that do not infringe on the
<br>
rights of others is a very bad thing to do. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I recall the right-wing William Shockley proposing that we pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; $1000 per I.Q. point below 100 to people to not have children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; If I had a real nation, and I cared about whether it prospered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; in a competitive world, I think that I'd go along with his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; proposal!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Would you allow immigration?  Think about it.  And how do you make sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people with &lt; 100 IQ don't cheat on the tests to get lower scores? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, this is a huge *IF*, but *if* I had a real nation, and cared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about whether it itself prospered and thrived in a competitive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, then the only immigrants that I'd allow were those of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same cultural background as my own people, and who would seemlessly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fit in, without fracturing the society into different groups.
</em><br>
<p>OK, you do that. I, the benevolent ruler of the neighbouring nation will
<br>
allow your tired, poor huddled masses to immingrate freely. OK, it is
<br>
going to be messy, but which nation do you think will be richest and
<br>
most dynamic 300 years after its funding? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; High IQ in most historical epochs would definitely help a society,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but yes, perhaps not so much as free trade and openness do.
</em><br>
<p>Why do you think IQ would help societies? Remember that it is very
<br>
weakly correlated to anything useful. It is better to create systems
<br>
that promote useful behavior than to try to fix complex underlying
<br>
factors, especially if you risk trampling people's rights in the
<br>
process. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not to mention the ethical problems with a government using tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; money to reward lack of intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The funds could be raised voluntarily.  In the 20th century it's hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for us to appreciate doing things without a strong government, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every time that Benjamin Franklin or others in his city wanted any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community projects undertaken, thing done, they'd go around door to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; door getting &quot;subscriptions&quot;.   In most cases, that's how things 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be done.  Freedom has worked very well, every time it's been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tried, so far as I know.
</em><br>
<p>OK, sorry for implying you had a statist agenda, although it sounded
<br>
like it from the benevolent ruler context of this thread. I don't see
<br>
any ethical problem for people to voluntarily set up funds for this
<br>
kind of project - it is still a waste of money and might have unwelcome
<br>
cultural influences, but people are free to waste money even on sinister
<br>
causes (and similarly, on counteracting them). 
<br>
<p>All in all, I think the IQ issue is pretty irrelevant here. What really
<br>
matters in the current thread is the ethics of forcing vs. supporting a
<br>
change in reproduction for some global goal.
