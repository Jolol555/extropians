<em>&gt;Subject: US Science Education Sucks

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the first grade. Teachers would have to be literate in science, and kids
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would have to find learning science as cool as following the fortunes of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rock
</em><br>
<em>&gt;groups. That's an awful lot to ask for. But then again, only our future
</em><br>
<em>&gt;depends on it.
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't think this person has ever done any long term teaching in the public 
<br>
schools.  I am a former teacher, and my experience shows that the people who 
<br>
make the best teachers are those who are the least educated.  The &quot;smart&quot; 
<br>
ones, the ones who are interested in science, usually leave the profession 
<br>
rather quickly (because they get tired of the abuse). In fact, the empirical 
<br>
evidence shows (at the empirical evidence to which *I* have access) that the 
<br>
halflife of a teacher's career is inversely proportional to his/her IQ.
<br>
<p>At least that was the case at both schools at which I taught. Of all the 
<br>
teachers who came into teaching when I did, the only ones still teaching are 
<br>
those who are the least academic. And I mean, they are not really 
<br>
academically inclined at *all*.
<br>
<p>You see, because of various factors, teachers now have little institutional 
<br>
authority.  So therefore, their authority mainly derives from personal 
<br>
relationships with other people: the students; the principal/vice principal; 
<br>
the parents.
<br>
<p>If you want a good teacher, find a &quot;people&quot; person, one with excellent 
<br>
communications skills, especially in the area of body language and voice 
<br>
control (an actor might be a good teacher).
<br>
<p>If you want a physicist, find a &quot;book/idea&quot; person. The intersection of 
<br>
these two sets is vanishingly small.
<br>
<p>A people person spent a lot of time with other people in his/her formative 
<br>
years. A book/idea person spent a lot of time with *books* in his/her 
<br>
formative years.
<br>
<p>So now you see how wrong is &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; regarding &quot;what is wrong 
<br>
with our schools.&quot;
<br>
<p>The main problem is that kids are even less rational than adults. Therefore 
<br>
in order to teach, one needs control.  And the erosion of teacher authority 
<br>
means that personal relationships are the key even being *able* to do *any* 
<br>
teaching, never mind the science pipe dreams....
<br>
<p>BTW, status relationships are crucial in the classroom.
