<p><em>&gt; &gt; Thank you Samantha for some lucid thinking on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thread.  I agree with almost all posts except those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whose aim is to chastise religion, spirituality or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the church.
</em><br>
<p>What does &quot;chastise&quot; mean here?  I can form almost an
<br>
inverse statement by affirming &quot;I agree with almost all
<br>
posts whose aim is to criticize religion, spirituality,
<br>
or the church&quot;, by merely using &quot;criticize&quot; instead.
<br>
Criticism is vital to rational thought.  If by &quot;chastise&quot;
<br>
you mean &quot;criticize in an unhelpful way&quot;, well, then I
<br>
guess that I can hardly disagree  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People who go to church, people who value ideas other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than extropian ideas, people who have a desire or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need for spirituality are not backward and unintelligent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many are creative and highly intelligent and who simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see things a different way because of deeply ingrained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief systems, early imprinting, fear of the unknown,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social conditioning, professional affiliation, or simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the music, atmosphere and wine.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly so.  &quot;Many&quot; is exactly correct, IMO.  I agree with
<br>
you and not J. R. when he wrote something to the effect of
<br>
&quot;all those who affirm religious beliefs are either liars
<br>
or idiots&quot;.  But I think that we often greatly underestimate
<br>
the number of those to which that DOES apply (here &quot;idiot&quot;
<br>
meaning someone who is pretty stupidly buying a lot of crap).
<br>
<p>L B (Meriss) says
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I rather enjoy a minor skirmish. But there was some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slashing going on and I don't know what contact [means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context, I think] to take it in.  Are you all just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kidding when you threaten to block someone's address
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just because you don't want to hear what they have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say or to punish them?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Slashing&quot;?  Like &quot;war&quot; these are totally undeserved 
<br>
analogies and metaphors.  Some, like the great semanticist
<br>
Count Alfred Korzybski, would say that you are making
<br>
yourself un-sane by such liberal usage of such terms (he
<br>
had a way of sometimes overstating things himself, but,
<br>
well, it was only 1933).
<br>
<p>As for &quot;threatening&quot; to block someone's email delivery,
<br>
it's no threat.  The people who say they're doing it
<br>
really are doing it.  I don't blame them a bit because
<br>
of this:  one has only so much time, and many people
<br>
have concluded that they don't have time to read
<br>
everything on this list.  So it's the same thing as
<br>
judging that they probably don't have time for so-and-so's
<br>
posts, only this way, they're not distracted by the
<br>
appearance of the email item.
<br>
<p>What I don't understand is why they have to announce it.
<br>
That seems a might peculiar.  Probably they only want to
<br>
offend and insult the party that annoyed them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So if it was all in jest, fine, but there was a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fur flying.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting.  Another tooth &amp; claw metaphor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think it was J.R. Malloy who was so angry with M. E.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Smith, but I'm not sure.  Anyway, the polarization began
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there.
</em><br>
<p>J. R. blasted away at religion, and, though I tried, I
<br>
couldn't find anything to criticize in his particulars
<br>
and in his denunciations.  You may have not liked the
<br>
tone---I wasn't too fond of it myself---but go ahead and
<br>
argue with the content if you'd like.  Besides, many 
<br>
people who've steeped themselves in the details of certain
<br>
atrocities, and then decry them, often naturally do so
<br>
in pretty strong language.  You, on the other hand, seem
<br>
to want to decry the tone and language without even a nodding 
<br>
reference to the specific shortcomings of religion and 
<br>
spirituality that were addressed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we are going to make this extropian life work, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hours we spent regarding this issue with such heat could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been spent more constructively.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I am mistaken, I apologize.
</em><br>
<p>Well, who knows if you are mistaken??  That's what we are
<br>
trying to figure out!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am with you, although I do not agree with chastising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atheism or anti-theism. 
</em><br>
<p>No one was, to my knowledge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So it doesn't matter if it [religiosity or spirituality]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is debunked or not, perhaps.
</em><br>
<p>It most certainly does!  Everything that is false needs to
<br>
be debunked (and nothing, of course, that is true should be.)
