<p>
At the risk of prolonging a discussion that has had much in the way of
<br>
unproductive &quot;talking past each other&quot;, I thought I'd put in some belated
<br>
comments regarding the &quot;race&quot; threads.
<br>
<p><p><p>First, some personal comments.  I grew up in the U.S. South during the
<br>
climax of the era of desegregation and what I saw during that time has had a
<br>
deep impact on my thinking and sentiments on the subject of race in general
<br>
and the history of slavery and its aftermath in particular.  As long-time
<br>
subscribers will also know, I'm very interested in the history of the
<br>
Enlightenment and what I consider to be one of its supreme achievements, the
<br>
founding of the secular, limited American republic.  Very much a part of the
<br>
study of that time has been an interest in &quot;the peculiar institution&quot; and
<br>
its role in both the biographies of the Founders (especially Jefferson) and
<br>
its effect on the initial conditions of the Revolution and its aftermath
<br>
through the Civil War and into our own time and beyond.  Finally, as a
<br>
libertarian, I've been keen to find alternatives to state action as remedies
<br>
for the lingering effects of slavery in the U.S. and the phenomenon of
<br>
racism in general.  This is both a matter of theoretical interest to me and
<br>
also one of immediate personal importance, since as a partner in a business
<br>
that is based on &quot;people power&quot;, I am keen to find talent wherever I can,
<br>
including among the descendants of slaves and recent immigrants.
<br>
<p><p><p>With all that said, I'll comment that I found the article that prompted this
<br>
discussion to be a bit of ham-fisted rhetoric.  Taken entirely by itself, I
<br>
found it to be in poor taste and to have a strongly implied and very thinly
<br>
disguised racist undertone.  Beyond this, though, the folks who've followed
<br>
the author's links to other pieces on his own site and beyond have made a
<br>
very legitimate job of contextualization.  I think it's both entirely fair
<br>
and quite important to find out where an author is &quot;coming from&quot;.  Sure, it'
<br>
s important to judge ideas on their own merits but, as I've pointed out in
<br>
the case of Jeremy Rifkin, taking one piece of writing out of context can
<br>
make someone seem far more reasonable than they really are.  In the case of
<br>
the fellow in question here, we see that the item offered sits within a
<br>
context of clear and open racism.  The old-fashioned white-power, &quot;Aryan
<br>
Nation&quot; crap this Reed person feeds on and himself feeds is the lowest form
<br>
of low-brow brownshirt ideology.
<br>
<p><p><p>As I've written in the FAQ item on extropianism and racism I offered here
<br>
the other day, it is fundamentally important that we distinguish our
<br>
thinking and values from those of the kind we see exhibited by Reed and his
<br>
cronies.  For better or worse, it is all too common for the uninformed to
<br>
equate transhumanism with eugenics and, from that false equation, to then
<br>
tar us with the brush of racism.  Making sure this doesn't happen MATTERS,
<br>
since we see before us in the news this week what bad thinking about human
<br>
biotechnology can result in.  It's one thing to be a curmudgeon about
<br>
&quot;political correctness&quot; (something I myself enjoy); it's quite another to
<br>
play into the hands of racist morons in the cultural struggle in which we
<br>
find ourselves embroiled.
