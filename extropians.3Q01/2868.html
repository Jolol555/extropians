<p><em>&gt; Being on the &quot;demonstrators' side; with  20/20 hindsight, let me say that we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could have won the war, with 3 million more North Vietnamese dead, and 20 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million Chinese dead; possibly using nuclear bombs to eliminate Chinese 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intervention. But now we are speaking to a classic Phyhric Victory. But to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may, on both sides, it seemed better to initiate action, rather then let the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; North Vietnamese dictate every action-which is what they did.
</em><br>
<p>No one on Earth, at the time, realized what a disaster socialist governments
<br>
were for their own economies (not to mention individuals).  The one thing
<br>
that the Communist nations did superbly was to wage war; for some reason,
<br>
the ruthless totalitarianism of a Stalin (who can assert loudly that if
<br>
General Zhukov fails to hold a certain city he'll be shot and everyone
<br>
knows that it's exactly true)---this central control really does seem to
<br>
work.
<br>
<p>North Korea with half the population and a small percentage of industry
<br>
was always a military threat to capitalist South Korea, never the reverse.
<br>
And North Vietnam easily beat the crap out of South Vietnam.  In any sort
<br>
of fair contest, I have no doubt that during the cold war East Germany
<br>
would have easily defeated West Germany, and it's no secret that the
<br>
Warsaw Pact was vastly more powerful than the entire set of nations
<br>
of Western Europe.  Give credit where credit is due.
<br>
<p>The United States was the great exception, because at the level of
<br>
the superpowers technology was crucial.  Though spending only 6% of
<br>
its GNP on defense (as opposed to the corresponding figure of 14%
<br>
for the much poorer Soviet Union), this turned out to be sufficient
<br>
to prevent a Soviet conquest of Europe and Soviet global domination.
<br>
Such considerations didn't matter in the small countries; they got
<br>
their arms and technology mainly from the Soviet Union or the United
<br>
States anyway.
<br>
<p>If only it had been known that Communism would soon fizzle in the Soviet
<br>
Union, sigh.  The wisest course for the West clearly would have been to
<br>
allow all of Southeast to become Communist, at a much reduced cost of
<br>
life and money.  But no one knew.
<br>
<p>Probably South Vietnam could have been indefinitely supported by the
<br>
United States following the major troop withdrawals of 1969-1973.  But
<br>
to simply abandon South Vietnam the way that the U.S. Congress did in
<br>
1974 and 1975---actually passing legislation preventing any further
<br>
substantial aid---was an act of treachery.  If you don't believe it,
<br>
try talking in depth to a few former South Vietnam patriotic small
<br>
fry in their armed forces, the way that I have.
