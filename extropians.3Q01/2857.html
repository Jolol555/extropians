</em><br>
<p>It sure does. There are all too many conservatives posing as
<br>
libertarians because libertarians throw better parties.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, notice that the plonking phase has set in (PLONK = 'I've
<br>
added you to my killfile and will no longer see anything you
<br>
post'). I'm not sure if that's a bad or a good thing. On the one hand,
<br>
it's a primitive sort of self-organization in action; individuals
<br>
selecting what they see without censoring what others see. On the
<br>
other, it's also people opting to stew in their own juices. Then
<br>
again, I guess we all have a fundamental right to stew in our own
<br>
juices.
