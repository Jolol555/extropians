<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Unlike Plato and Aristotle (Hegel, etc.) we do not believe that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; little divine element in us that needs to be nurtured. Darwin killed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; idea forever. So, transhumanists substitute technology (most notably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; engineering and AI) for (3). What separates us from Plato et al is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; quibble about the means to become what we ought to be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Darwin did no such thing.  There is nothing in evolution that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forces such a conclusion.  If you believe there is, then please
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; show it.  If we are totally determined by evolution both in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; current state and our potential then all our transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dreams would be ridiculous.  If we are not so determined then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there most certainly does exist a spark of the divine, a spark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the ability to transcend, within all of us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plato held that humans are composite creatures: bodies plus souls.
</em><br>
<p>Evolution does not conclusively show this view is false. 
<br>
Dualism is alive and well.  Some religious folks teach that
<br>
evolution was the means for perfecting a body for living in this
<br>
sort of world but that the souls chose to enter these bodies. 
<br>
Before you jump all over that consider that many of us here
<br>
honestly expect to be able to upload the essence of ourselves
<br>
(or or progeny) into computers (astral plane anyone?) and to
<br>
possibly download into bodies designed to our current needs in
<br>
whole or part.  Dualism is still alive and well.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; A lucky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few (specifically, philosophical types) have an added bonus: divine soul
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff. Many think that accepting Darwinianism makes unlikely the soul
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis, a fortiori, the bonus of divine soul stuff is unlikely. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divine soul stuff is what I meant by 'element' above. Is this what you mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by 'spark'? I myself do not believe that the desire and the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transcend ourselves requires an appeal to a soul hypothesis, indeed, I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is quite compatible with a Darwinian etiology. Of course, others may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree with me. (Nietzsche, for example, believes that desires, and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically, acting on desires like attempting to transcend oneself are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explained by Darwinianism. According to Herr N., the will to live ought to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be replaced with a deeper explanation: the will to power. So here we have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secular but alternate explanation). Mark
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that Darwin's work has a lot to do with hypotheses
<br>
about souls or lack of same.  It certainly wasn't something he
<br>
himself claimed one way or the other afaik.  Thus it is
<br>
inaccurate to describe the no-soul view as being &quot;Darwinian&quot;. 
<br>
It is not and causes confusion that makes thinks like evolution
<br>
debates much more heated than they would otherwise be.  What is
<br>
secular and not when you would see humans or our creations
<br>
become like unto gods?
