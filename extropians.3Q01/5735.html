<p>
There is a thought I have been pondering for a time...
<br>
<p>I have noticed that in some cases the Internet has become a dangerous crutch for political movements.
<br>
Of course there are good ways and bad ways to use the Internet, and some have succeeded for doing it well, particularly when coordinating actions.
<br>
<p>But it has also &quot;tricked&quot; some movements into thinking that they have good discourses, into thinking that just if you put up a pdf- file or a website on the Internet you will reach a large number of persons.
<br>
<p>But the raelians have a site too. 
<br>
In itself it isn't enough, but there is a false comfort in it that makes the movement neglect the important work in society around it, particularly since even today the most important debates are not on the Internet.
<br>
<p>We haven't seen that the Internet has acquired the position as political centre for society, as was said (yet?)
<br>
<p><p>On to something or out in the blue?
<br>
Comments?
<br>
Thoughts?
<br>
<p>Waldemar
