<p>StarLink Bio-Corn Found in White Corn Products - Post
<br>
<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - StarLink corn, the genetically modified yellow
<br>
variety whose presence in food products last fall resulted in widespread
<br>
recalls, has been found for the first time in a white corn product, The
<br>
Washington Post reported on Wednesday.
<br>
<p>The Post said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (news - web sites) (FDA)
<br>
discovered genetic material from StarLink corn in Kash n' Karry White Corn
<br>
Tortilla Chips last month in response to a complaint from a consumer in
<br>
Florida.
<br>
<p>An FDA official said the agency did not request a recall, but both the Kash
<br>
n' Karry and Food Lion grocery chains pulled the house brand product from
<br>
their shelves on Tuesday, according to the paper.
<br>
<p>No immediate comment was available from FDA officials or Aventis SA, the
<br>
Franco-German pharmaceutical group that makes the biotech corn.
<br>
<p>Last fall, many corn chip and tortilla makers switched to white corn, which
<br>
makes up less than 3 percent of the U.S. corn market, to reassure consumers
<br>
concerned about the possible presence of StarLink in their taco shells and
<br>
corn chips.
<br>
<p>At the time, producers said the use of white corn eliminated the risk of
<br>
inadvertently introducing StarLink into their products.
<br>
<p>StarLink, genetically modified by Aventis CropSciences to be resistant to
<br>
insects, was barred by U.S. regulators for human use because of concerns it
<br>
might trigger allergic reactions such as rashes, diarrhea or breathing
<br>
problems.
<br>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (news - web sites) in 1998 approved the
<br>
biotech corn variety, used by farmers to protect young plants from
<br>
destructive plants, only for feed use.
<br>
<p>But traces of StarLink corn found their way into taco shells, chips and
<br>
other food products, triggering the eventual recall of more than 300 U.S.
<br>
foods.
<br>
<p>Dozens of people initially reported experiencing allergic reactions linked
<br>
to StarLink-tainted food products last year.
<br>
<p>The U.S. government last month released a report showing that 17 people who
<br>
had complained of possible allergy attacks after eating corn products had
<br>
failed to show any signs of antibodies to StarLink's key component.
<br>
<p>But environmentalists said the report was flawed and inconclusive.
<br>
<p>The Post said the FDA found the StarLink gene in the white corn chips after
<br>
being notified by Keith Finger, a Florida optometrist who was one of the 17
<br>
tested earlier.
<br>
<p>Finger said his wife bought the white corn chips after hearing reports that
<br>
it could not contain StarLink. He said he ate some, suffered another, milder
<br>
reaction and immediately contacted the FDA.
<br>
<p>The Post quoted an FDA official as saying the agency was ''continuing to
<br>
follow up on the situation.''
<br>
<p>White corn is grown and distributed separately from yellow corn, and
<br>
industry observers said there are no genetically modified varieties.
<br>
<p>But they also said it has proven impossible to prevent some commingling of
<br>
conventional and modified, as well as white and yellow, corn. The mixing,
<br>
they said, could happen at processing plants, during transportation and
<br>
through cross-pollination in fields.
<br>
<p>An EPA advisory panel of experts will meet in Washington on July 17 to
<br>
review new StarLink information and recommend whether or not to grant a
<br>
request by Aventis to retroactively approve StarLink for human consumption.
