<em>&gt;From: &quot;Mitchell, Jerry (3337)&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:Jerry.Mitchell@esavio.com?Subject=RE:%20Paying%20for%20Schools%20(was:%20SOCIETY:%20Re:%20The%20privatization%20of%20pu%20blic%20security)&In-Reply-To=&lt;129BE00D9DC8D411927600805FA715286B82F0@groexmbcr11.pfizer.com&gt;">Jerry.Mitchell@esavio.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;Im not aware of any place unrestrained capitalism has even been tested.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Right.  Its never been *completely* without restraint.  But the early to
<br>
mid 
<br>
19th Century US comes pretty damn close.&quot;
<br>
<p>Right, it came close, but had some *vital* differences.  Such as the fact
<br>
the government made it illegal for employees to form unions and protect
<br>
themselves and turned a blind eye to employers heinous acts against union
<br>
formers.  This is not moral, not ethical, and not libertarian.  It is the
<br>
government jobs to protect the rights of the individual, which includes
<br>
protecting them from employers hiring thugs to kill them.  In a true free
<br>
market environment the government makes no restrictions on employers OR
<br>
employees, in the early part of last century, restrictions were in place on
<br>
employees behaviors.  The removes the most fundamentally important aspect of
<br>
the market, the negative feedback effect the worker has on the employer by
<br>
choosing to not to work.  Thers is a big difference between choosing not to
<br>
form a union and having a government agent placeing a gun to your head and
<br>
telling you that you can not form a union.  The quantatively minor
<br>
differences that the market had back then were vitally important and can not
<br>
be ignored.
