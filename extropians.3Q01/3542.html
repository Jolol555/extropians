<p><em>&gt;&gt; What do you mean &quot;right&quot;?  Do you mean there should not be a legal right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for that organism to come into being (I agree)?  I don't know what else
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you could mean here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mean the &quot;basic&quot; right or &quot;natural&quot; right which some view it as one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; duty of the law to encode.  For instance, the famous American right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free speech (even if it has been poorly implemented by American law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recently, IMO).
</em><br>
<p>I've always had a lot of trouble with this.  It seems to me that we have
<br>
human beings, and many other parts of the physical universe.  These
<br>
&quot;natural rights&quot; appear from my vantage point to resemble God in the
<br>
sense that many people talk about them but no one has any evidence
<br>
that they exist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, I was criticizing a view slightly different from yours, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holds that there should be the maximum number possible of beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *regardless of all other considerations*, which is the viewpoint I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a number of so-called &quot;pro-life&quot; arguments holding.
</em><br>
<p>I know of a few religions that enjoin their members to be as prolific
<br>
as possible, but all the &quot;pro-life&quot; factions that I've seen are merely
<br>
people who affirm that one millisecond after conception, the number of
<br>
souls in the universe magically increases by an indivisible unit, and
<br>
that it is wrong to kill the resulting fetus.  You and I probably agree
<br>
that (a) it's the decision of the mother, or family, not other people's
<br>
business, and (b) if bringing that being into full life is going to 
<br>
inconvenience its parents, then I do not critize their decision because
<br>
I make a lot of selfish decisions myself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Make no mistake, it is the cost I object to, not the new life itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If pregnancy and raising children were cost free, this would be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonissue - but that is far from the case today.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p>Lee
