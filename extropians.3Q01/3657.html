Let us reason together.
<br>
<p>I think perhaps &quot;proto-transhominid&quot; for  &quot;early adopter of mods&quot; might be acceptable to all concerned.
<br>
Not rhetorically scary, analogous to &quot;proto-hominid&quot;, has a loan-word feel from the term &quot;prototyping&quot;.
<br>
<p>* Eliezer, what say you?
<br>
<p>&quot;Strong-&quot; and &quot;weak-transhuman&quot; are right out, for obvious reasons.
<br>
<p>* Natasha, does &quot;proto-transhuman&quot; sound utterly horrible to you? 
<br>
I think &quot;early transhuman&quot; is pretty interchangeable with that. 
<br>
What do you say?
<br>
<p>* Samantha: does this address your concerns?

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And you should be very careful in trying to reinvent terms to suit your particular needs and espousing them as a given.

<em>&gt; This seems to be a little daunting.  How can anyone be a part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any movement or claim any term as their own without growing into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the term informed by and having it inform their own life?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transhuman has to mean to me and to each one of us what it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that leads us to transcend and to move constantly forward.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wouldn't it be better to gather the richness of people's
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of quibbling over what the word does and does not mean
</em><br>
