There is no reason gender as such should disappear completely
<br>
that I am aware of.  It will become less bi-gendered and rigid. 
<br>
But I don't see where it disappearing completely is inevitable
<br>
or even desirable. If it occurred it would simply be different,
<br>
not necessarily better. 
<br>
<p>I am not sure &quot;revolution&quot; is a word I really understand as so
<br>
many people many so many different things by it.  What is coming
<br>
will be utterly revolutionary in that the possibilities are wide
<br>
open.  We have many more degrees of freedom than ever before. 
<br>
It is important that we choose/create a viable future from those
<br>
possibilities rather than fragmenting totally into our own trips
<br>
I believe.  But we are talking the possibility of total
<br>
transformation of almost everything we are and do as real
<br>
possibility.  That is about as revolutionary as it gets.  
<br>
<p>Society will change utterly when we move to basic and
<br>
fundamental abundance rather than basic and fundamental
<br>
scarcity.  The old economic models and much of our sociological
<br>
and psychological models are geared to scarcity.  Individualism
<br>
vs. communism and the notion there is a &quot;vs&quot; to it are also
<br>
quite mired in and dependent on the old scarcity model.  A large
<br>
part of the challenge is going to be seeing with fresh eyes
<br>
instead of imposing old patterns and prejudices on the
<br>
fundamentally different.
