<p>
We have had an actor as president before, he did fine.  Some would
<br>
argue we have an actor as president now, he is doing fine.  So why
<br>
not actor Charleton Heston?  Here is a speech he made.  Im not with
<br>
him on the god stuff, but the rest of it sounds about right:
<br>
<p>Charlton Heston's Speech to the Harvard Law School Forum
<br>
<p>I remember my son when he was five, explaining to his kindergarten class what
<br>
his father did for a living. &quot;My Daddy,&quot; he said, &quot;pretends to be people.
<br>
&quot;There have been quite a few of them.  Prophets from the Old and New
<br>
Testaments, a couple of Christian saints, generals of various nationalities
<br>
and different centuries, several kings, three American presidents, a French
<br>
cardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo. If you want the ceiling
<br>
repainted I'll do my best.
<br>
<p>As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my Creator gave me the gift
<br>
to connect you with the hearts and minds of those great men, then I want to
<br>
use that same gift now to reconnect you with your own sense of liberty, of
<br>
your own freedom of thought ... your own compass for what is right.
<br>
<p>Dedicating the memorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America,&quot;We
<br>
are now engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation or any
<br>
nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure.&quot; Those words are true
<br>
again. I believe that we are again engaged in a great civil war, a cultural
<br>
war that's about to hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in
<br>
your heart. I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty
<br>
inside you ... the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into the
<br>
miracle that it is.
<br>
<p>Let me back up....Some time back, I became president of the National Rifle
<br>
Association, which protects the right to keep and bear arms. I ran for
<br>
office, I was elected, and now I serve ... I serve as a moving target for the
<br>
media, who've called me everything from &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;duped&quot; to a
<br>
&quot;brain-injured, senile, crazy old man.&quot; I know I'm pretty old ... but I sure,
<br>
Lord, ain't senile. As I have stood in the crosshairs of those who target
<br>
Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that firearms are not the only
<br>
issue. No, it's much, much bigger than that.
<br>
<p>I've come to understand that a cultural war is raging across our land, in
<br>
which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable thoughts and speech are
<br>
mandated. For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963-long
<br>
before Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told an audience last year
<br>
that white pride is just as valid as black pride or red pride or anyone
<br>
else's pride, they called me a racist.
<br>
<p>I've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. But when I
<br>
told an audience that gay rights should extend no further than your rights or
<br>
my rights, I was called a homophobe.
<br>
<p>I served in World War II against the Axis Powers. But during a speech, when I
<br>
drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews and singling out innocent
<br>
gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.
<br>
<p>Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my country.
<br>
But when I asked an audience to oppose this cultural persecution, I was
<br>
compared to Timothy McVeigh. From Time magazine to friends and
<br>
colleagues, they're essentially saying, &quot;Chuck, how dare you speak your mind.
<br>
You are using language not authorized for public consumption!&quot; But I am not
<br>
afraid. If Americans believed in political correctness, we'd still be King
<br>
George's boys.....subjects bound to the British crown.
<br>
<p>In his book, &quot;The End of Sanity,&quot; Martin Gross writes that &quot;blatantly
<br>
irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the norm in almost every
<br>
area of human endeavor. There seem to be new customs, new rules, new
<br>
anti-intellectual theories regularly foisted on us from every direction.
<br>
Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something without a name is
<br>
undermining the nation, turning the mind mushy when it comes to separating
<br>
truth from falsehood and right from wrong. And they don't like it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Let me read a few examples.
<br>
<p>a.. In New Jersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who had
<br>
been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- the state
<br>
commissioner announced that health providers who are HIV-positive need
<br>
not.... need not. ... tell their patients that they are infected.
<br>
<p>b. At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of the school team,
<br>
&quot;The Tribe&quot; because it was supposedly insulting to local Indians, only to
<br>
learn that authentic Virginia chiefs truly like the name.
<br>
<p>c. In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the rights
<br>
of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and for transsexuals to have
<br>
separate toilet facilities while undergoing sex change surgery.
<br>
<p>d. In New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have been placed
<br>
in bilingual classes to learn their three R's in Spanish, solely because
<br>
their last names sound Hispanic.
<br>
<p>e. At the University of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands died at
<br>
Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that college officially set up
<br>
segregated dormitory space for black students. Yeah, I know that's out of
<br>
bounds now.
<br>
<p>Dr. King said &quot;Negroes.&quot; Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said
<br>
&quot;black.&quot; But it's a no-no now. For me, hyphenated identities are
<br>
awkward...particularly &quot;Native-American.&quot;  I'm a Native American, for God's
<br>
sake. I also happen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux.
<br>
On my wife's side, my grandson is a thirteenth generation Native American...
<br>
with a capital letter on &quot;American.&quot;
<br>
<p>Finally, just last month ... ..David Howard, head of the Washington, DC
<br>
Office of Public Advocate, used the word &quot;niggardly&quot; while talking to
<br>
colleagues about budgetary matters. Of course, &quot;niggardly&quot; means stingy or
<br>
scanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and resign.
<br>
As columnist Tony Snow wrote: &quot;David Howard got fired because some people in
<br>
public employ were morons who: 1.. didn't know the meaning of niggardly, 2..
<br>
didn't know how to use a dictionary to discover the meaning, and 3.. actually
<br>
demanded that he apologize for their ignorance.&quot;
<br>
<p>What does all of this mean? It means that telling us what to think has
<br>
evolved into telling us what to say,
<br>
so telling us what to do can't be far behind.
<br>
<p>Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why did political
<br>
correctness originate on America's campuses? And why do you continue to
<br>
tolerate it? Why do you, who are supposed to debate ideas,
<br>
surrender to their suppression?
<br>
<p>Let's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what they really
<br>
believe? It scares me to death, and it should scare you too, that the
<br>
superstition of &quot;political correctness&quot; rules the halls of reason. You are
<br>
the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradle of American
<br>
academia, here in the castle of learning on the Charles River, you are the
<br>
cream. But I submit that you, and your counterparts across the land, are the
<br>
most socially conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord
<br>
Bridge.  And as long as you validate that.... and abide it... you are-by your
<br>
grandfathers' standards-cowards.
<br>
<p>Here's another example. Right now at more than one major university, Second
<br>
Amendment scholars and researchers are being told to shut up about their
<br>
findings or they'll lose their jobs. Why? Because their research findings
<br>
would undermine big-city mayor's pending lawsuits that seek to extort
<br>
hundreds of millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers.
<br>
<p>I don't care what you think about guns. But if you are not shocked at that, I
<br>
am shocked at you. Who will guard the raw material of unfettered ideas, if
<br>
not you? Who will defend the core value of academia, if you supposed soldiers
<br>
of free thought and expression lay down your arms and plead, &quot;Don't shoot me.&quot;
<br>
<p>If you talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If you see
<br>
distinctions between the genders, it does not make you a sexist. If you think
<br>
critically about a denomination, it does not make you anti-religion. If you
<br>
accept but don't celebrate homosexuality, it does not make you a homophobe.
<br>
<p>Don't let America's universities continue to serve as incubators for this
<br>
rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism.
<br>
But what can you do? How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social
<br>
subjugation? The answer's been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on
<br>
the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, standing with Dr. Martin
<br>
Luther King and two hundred thousand people. You simply ... disobey.
<br>
Peaceably, yes.  Respectfully, of course.  Nonviolently, absolutely. But when
<br>
told how to think or what to say or how to behave,
<br>
we don't. We disobey social protocol that stifles and stigmatizes personal
<br>
freedom. I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... who
<br>
learned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau, and Jesus, and every other great man who
<br>
led those in the right against those with the might.
<br>
<p>Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with that disobedient
<br>
spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor....that sent Thoreau to jail, that
<br>
refused to sit in the back of the bus, that protested a war in Viet Nam. In
<br>
that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow a cultural correctness with
<br>
massive disobedience of rogue authority, social directives and onerous laws
<br>
that weaken personal freedom.
<br>
<p>But be careful.... It hurts. Disobedience demands that you put yourself at
<br>
risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies. You must be willing to be
<br>
humiliated ... to endure the modern-day equivalent of the police dogs at
<br>
Montgomery and the water cannons at Selma. You must be willing to experience
<br>
discomfort. I'm not complaining, but my own decades of social activism have
<br>
taken their toll on me.
<br>
<p>Let me tell you a story. A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T,
<br>
who was selling a CD called &quot;Cop Killer&quot;, celebrating ambushing and murdering
<br>
police officers. It was being marketed by none other than Time/Warner, the
<br>
biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world. Police across the country
<br>
were outraged. Rightfully so-at least one had been murdered. But Time/Warner
<br>
was stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the media were
<br>
tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black. I heard Time/Warner had a
<br>
stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly Hills. I owned some shares at the
<br>
time, so I decided to attend. What I did there was against the advice of my
<br>
family and colleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of a thousand
<br>
average American stockholders, I simply read the full lyrics of &quot;Cop Killer&quot;,
<br>
every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.
<br>
<p>&quot;I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFF.
<br>
I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF.
<br>
I'M ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF.
<br>
I'M ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF...&quot;
<br>
It got worse, a lot worse. I won't read the rest of it to you. But trust me,
<br>
the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanched faces. The Time/Warner
<br>
executives squirmed in their chairs and stared at their shoes. They hated
<br>
me for that.
<br>
<p>Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist filth,
<br>
where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year old nieces of Al and
<br>
Tipper Gore. &quot;SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ....&quot;
<br>
<p>Well, I won't do to you here what I did to them. Let's just say I left the
<br>
room in echoing silence. When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps,
<br>
one of them said &quot;We can't print that.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; I replied, &quot;but Time/Warner's selling it.&quot; Two months
<br>
later,Time/Warner terminated Ice-T's contract. I'll never be offered another
<br>
film by Warner's, or get a good review from Time magazine. But disobedience
<br>
means you must be willing to act, not just talk.
<br>
<p>When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jam the
<br>
switchboard of the district attorney's office.
<br>
<p>When your university is pressured to lower standards until 80%of the students
<br>
graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board of regents.
<br>
<p>When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on the playground and gets hauled
<br>
into court for sexual harassment, march on that school and block its doorways.
<br>
<p>When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays
<br>
you...petition them, oust them, banish them.
<br>
<p>When Time magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazy
<br>
Christians holding a cross as it did last month....boycott their magazine and
<br>
the products it advertises. So that this nation may long endure, I urge
<br>
you to follow in the hallowed footsteps of the great disobedience's of
<br>
history that freed exiles, founded religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in
<br>
the hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men, by God's grace,
<br>
built this country. If Dr. King were here, I think he would agree.
<br>
Thank you
