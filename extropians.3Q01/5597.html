<em>&gt;&gt; It's not actually necessary to be able to answer a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; question to demonstrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that the existing answers are inadequate.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; But you haven't done that...  amd you can't do that by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely stringing together a few syllables.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anomalous data is what demonstrates the existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answers are incomplete (to show they are actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong you'd still have to come up with something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better).  Where's the data?  I need data, not hot air
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hand waving.
</em><br>
<p>The anomalies in the idea that science is a progression toward absolute
<br>
truth are many. From a historical perspective, Kuhn documents with great
<br>
precision how scientists have adjusted the historical record of their
<br>
practice to make it fit this model, and how much of a misrepresentation this
<br>
is. From a theoretical perspective, Goedel demonstrated that no formal
<br>
system can be both consistent and complete, which seems to be a death blow
<br>
to the idea of a final theory. Other problems can be found in philosophy,
<br>
from Pyrrho and Sextus Empiricus through Hume to Nietzsche and beyond.
<br>
Nowhere is there any workable theory of this &quot;absolute truth.&quot; The more we
<br>
know, the more we know that our knowledge is relative to evolved modes of
<br>
knowledge which have no necessary validity beyond their arbitrary domain.
<br>
<p>I've snipped some of the rest of your diffuse critique cum personal attack.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As soon as you demonstrate to me that people with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different beliefs get different outcomes for the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment, I'll give your theories a bit more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention.
</em><br>
<p>This is, of course, a straw man argument, having no bearing whatsoever on
<br>
any claim I have made or any idea I have put forth for consideration. I do
<br>
not accept the idea that the beliefs of an experimenter determine the
<br>
outcome of a properly constructed experiment. (Of course, a psychological
<br>
experiment carried out without double-blind precautions could easily be
<br>
influenced by an experimenter's preconceptions).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Until then they are the equivalent of the gigantic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invisible purple alien who sits atop the world trade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; center and controls the thoughts of everybody in New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; York.
</em><br>
<p>That's just how I feel about &quot;absolute truth&quot; and the progression thereto.
<br>
It's a chimera. No one can point to it, yet some people feel a great
<br>
certainty that it exists. To me this is a mystical belief, in the negative
<br>
sense of the word mystical. One might as well believe in God as in this
<br>
&quot;absolute truth,&quot; which apparently exists only in God's mind.
