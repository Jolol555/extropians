</em><br>
<p>No, I actually meant racist postings.
<br>
Molloy and Lorrey didn't discuss racism. And it really has little to do 
<br>
with uncomfortable ideas. If the discussion was about ways to solve the 
<br>
problem of racial inequality, noting that many of the poorest segments of 
<br>
society are predominantly black, then yes it would have been something 
<br>
people would have felt uncomfortable about, but discussion may have been a 
<br>
heck of a lot more profitable. But some of the puke that Lorrey and Molloy 
<br>
came up with did not amount to discussion and it is no wonder it was 
<br>
pounced upon by many here.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; The denials of racism by some of the (plonked) individuals here
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wow!  First, do you know that &quot;plonked&quot; means that someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has engaged an automatic process by which (roughly speaking)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a certain person's posts never even get to his mailbox?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If this isn't a frightened tactic of self-censorship, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't know what is.  (I hasten to add, that quite often
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experienced discussion list members employ plonking not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prevent their eyes from meeting disagreeable points of view,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but rather because someone's posts over a great deal of time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have shown themselves to be without content, or too long, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some other non-partisan cause.)
</em><br>
<p>Well, they get filtered to my trash box. I just don't read my trash, and it 
<br>
gets emptied from time to time, whereas all my other email gets preserved 
<br>
(backed up on CDROM from time to time). But yes, I understand &quot;plonk&quot;.
<br>
<p>And no, it wasn't a &quot;frightened tactic&quot; at all. I found Lorrey's posts to 
<br>
be of no use to me, and his aggressiveness was tainting my email 
<br>
experience... I was almost coming to dread reading the list. Molloy didn't 
<br>
seem to have anything worthwhile either. This list is very active, and I 
<br>
found this a way to bring it back within manageable size. Both are 
<br>
extremely frequent posters, and I get about 100 emails a day (mostly 
<br>
computing &amp; VR lists) without the extropians list. As someone else here 
<br>
said: time is the most precious resource.
<br>
<p>It took me a fair while for me to come to the decision to filter them out. 
<br>
I didn't want to lose the possibility of useful thoughts from someone who 
<br>
was just having a bad day... or a bad week.
<br>
<p>I was considering starting a thread on plonking as I do consider it a 
<br>
potentially dangerous thing to do. Being a tech nerd, I am very aware of 
<br>
the dangers of positive feedback loops.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Second, what that person said
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;I'm not racist. I can't help that blacks are stupid.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is *not* necessarily absurd, as you claim.  It may be entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong; it may be a gross over-generalization; it may be so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;utterly an unqualified assertion that it absolutely demands
</em><br>
<em>&gt;refutation---but it's not absurd.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, come on Lee. You don't seriously think that, surely. :-)
<br>
Of *course* it is absurd. The first statement, that he was not racist, is 
<br>
clearly contradicted by the second, a racist statement if ever there was one.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;As Jerry Mitchell has written,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we must very precisely face square-on those assertions with which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we disagree, if we are not to simply paper them over, and let
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their inaccuracy fester.
</em><br>
<p>Jerry Mitchell doesn't make a lot of sense if you ask me.
<br>
The words sound noble, that we face up to contrary opinions, but practical 
<br>
considerations intrude. Endlessly debating racism as a potentially valid 
<br>
viewpoint every time it reared its ugly head might be OK if we were already 
<br>
immortal, but who has the time? You only need to show it is a mistake once 
<br>
then move on. Avoid wrestling with a pig -- the pig enjoys it and you get 
<br>
covered in mud.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Evidently, you did not dismiss that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;person's claim out of hand, but tried to reason very closely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(in a hopefully open-minded way, where your sincere desire for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the truth did not display undue disdain on your part).  Good for you.
</em><br>
<p>:-) Well, after I got my hysterical laughter under control I tried to 
<br>
reason with him. I probably would not have laughed so hard if he wasn't an 
<br>
old friend and knew he could withstand my amusement. And I know I wouldn't 
<br>
have tried so hard to reason with him if he hadn't been a friend. But I 
<br>
don't think he ever saw the conflict in what he said. He remains a friend 
<br>
to this day, and is an otherwise very smart person. He just has this weird 
<br>
thing about race... like some other friends of mine who are religious. 
<br>
[shakes head]
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
