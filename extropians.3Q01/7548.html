<em>&gt; &gt;.... Though the Government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the oppositional parties officially stand &quot;as one wo-man&quot; behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; President Bush, there is much irritation about German soldiers preparing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for war.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; It disturbs me that any people anywhere are standing &quot;as one&quot; behind Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and his plans....
</em><br>
<p>Standing &quot;as one&quot; is the official Government position. There is of course a
<br>
strong movement against  military involvement, but critical voices were shut
<br>
down in the last two weeks when 200.000 people gathered in the centre of
<br>
Berlin to express their sorrow for the victims of terror and their
<br>
solidarity with the US nation. The whole German nation stopped working
<br>
and moving for five minutes at 10 o´clock in the morning two days after the
<br>
events in NY and Washington in silent memory of the victims. People here
<br>
are shocked to learn that the civil kamikaze attacks were probably planned
<br>
in Hamburg. So everybody feels worried and helpless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Freedom and justice requiresmore of us than standing &quot;as one&quot;.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires questioning everything every step of the way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Blind faith in our leaders or in US leaders is very dangerous and an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insult to true democracy and true patriotism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

</em><br>
<p>Of course there were and there are warnings not to get involved too
<br>
seriously in a war nobody can win. But anyone who is calling for a more
<br>
sensible approach to the problem of terrorism is confronted with the
<br>
stereotype answer that especially Germany has to be a true friend and
<br>
support every step of the Bush administration though parliament first has
<br>
to approve NATO decisions. There probably will be enforcements
<br>
concerning the restriction of privacy and there will definitely
<br>
even be additional taxes on cigarettes to pay for there armament of the
<br>
German forces. So: smoke another and you support the war against terrorism.
