<em>&gt;&gt; Let's agree that thinking the material world as something &quot;bad&quot; is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; very strange notion (to say the very least), and that we do not think so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the material world is inherently neutral, which in some ways is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost as bad as active hostility.  I think that a lot of the problem can
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself and physical reality.
</em><br>
<p>I think that we should always emphasize that everything
<br>
depends on the the material world.  There are a number of
<br>
very good reasons to resist the ideas of those who would
<br>
complain about it (going all the way back to the Church
<br>
whose tendency was to minimal this mundane life in favor
<br>
of the next).  So I wouldn't even begin to play this game
<br>
of &quot;judging&quot; the material world (bad, neutral, or hostile).
<br>
<p>I had been supposing that there already were levels of implementation
<br>
(or abstraction) between me and the physical world.  I see my body
<br>
as just a device that allows my actual living to take place;  that's
<br>
why I look forward to an upgrade to distributed hardware.  The 
<br>
material world will be no more abandoned then  than it is now:  if
<br>
I have my way, I'll have sensors throughout whatever solar systems
<br>
I live in that keep me posted on the slow-moving physical world.
<br>
If all goes well, then I'll have to pay even less attention to it
<br>
than I do now.
