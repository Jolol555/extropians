<p>
Daniel Ust, recently made several statements to the general
<br>
effect that &quot;the U.S. goverment should stop acting in international
<br>
arenas&quot;.
<br>
<p>One of which was:
<br>
<em>&gt; They were, of course, drafted and their leaders trying to play at world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politics. I wouldn't mind if Bush really was an isolationist in the sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of withdrawing militarily from the world -- limiting the US military to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defending only US soil -- and stop the flow of aid (tax dollars) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere else -- as well as returning such money to its rightful owners.
</em><br>
<p>Now, Daniel is someone whom I have an immense amount of respect for
<br>
because he has a much better education in areas in which I wish that
<br>
my education were as deep as his.
<br>
<p>However, *purely* from an Extropic perspective, I am going to
<br>
take my glove and slap him across the face, and say &quot;I challenge
<br>
you -- for YOU are not an Extropian&quot;.  The essence of an extropian
<br>
perspective is the desire to combat entropy -- the diminishment
<br>
of information.  What we witnessed recently was a classic example
<br>
of the destruction of information, both in the minds of individuals
<br>
now dead and in the knowledge bases of commercial enterprises that
<br>
are unlikely to survive this incident.  This is an extropic loss on a
<br>
scale that has probably not been witnessed in the last 45+ years.
<br>
<p>What we have witnessed over the last decade or so in the Balkans
<br>
and in Kuwait were similar massive extropic losses (more difficult
<br>
to quantify because of the difficulties of equating loss-of-life
<br>
with loss-of-economic-activity).  Furthermore, had we not acted
<br>
in those situations they ran the risk of those conflicts expanding
<br>
into situations that could have significantly impacted the economic
<br>
health of the USA (resulting in decreased economic growth and a
<br>
diminishment in the production of information and/or complexity).
<br>
<p>As I've stated before, and I'll state again -- the greatest stain
<br>
on past/current governments in terms of &quot;extropic sin&quot; was/is the lack
<br>
of intervention in the previous and continuing Central African genocides.
<br>
<p>Now, if I look back over the last 10-15 years of my life, and
<br>
how I've allocated my resources, I can make a reasonable case
<br>
that the U.S. Government has done a better job of allocating
<br>
my tax dollars for extropic purposes than I have done with
<br>
my non-tax dollars.  So when I recently discovered that I may
<br>
have significantly overpaid my income taxes and may not be able
<br>
to recover those funds, I could rationalize it without too much
<br>
difficulty.  For Daniel to be able to support his position, I believe
<br>
he has to make a *strong* case, not only *he*, but a significant
<br>
majority of Americans must be better at allocating their resources
<br>
for extropic purposes than the American government is.  I challenge
<br>
him to make that case!
<br>
<p>Not that I think the American government is *trying* to allocate
<br>
its resources extropically.  I just think for some reason it
<br>
seems to naturally be able to do so.  It may be some emergent
<br>
property of democratic governments.  This may be related to the
<br>
fact that individuals can experience &quot;self-gratification&quot; while
<br>
governments cannot.  Governments can only experience self-preservation.
<br>
So perhaps self-preservational behaviors have a much greater multiplier
<br>
effect for extropic production than self-gratification behaviors.
<br>
<p>So, I challenge Daniel and other extropians to set aside their
<br>
personal beliefs (or agendas?) and ask themselves what will maximize
<br>
the production of extropic bits?  If you want to stick with your
<br>
personal agendas, you are going to have to &quot;prove&quot; their worth
<br>
extropically to me.
<br>
<p>Robert
