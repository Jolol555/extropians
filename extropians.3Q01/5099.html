Zero said

<p><em>&gt; After all, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think *everyone* would agree that there exists an inalienable right to
</em><br>
life.
<br>
<p>Really?? What sort of right is it supposed to be? Is it a restriction on
<br>
legislative power? Is it a claim right against everyone for the minimum
<br>
means of life? Or what?
<br>
<p>I realise you're not actually arguing for any of these things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Not too long ago one Timothy McVeigh had his right to life, well,
</em><br>
severely
<br>
<em>&gt;abridged.
</em><br>
<p>Quite so. His execution was justified by law (which does not necessarily
<br>
mean that I approve of such laws, just that it was, in fact, the law).
