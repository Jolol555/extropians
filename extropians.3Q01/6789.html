<em>&gt; I, myself, have been disturbed at how often people try to link racism,

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some recent postings seem to suggest that we should sacrifice innocents to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed up the development of technology in the name of The Extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Principals.  I do not think these ideas derive from the principals at all.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, Harvey.  This week has been an emotional time for all of us
<br>
and we have been struggling to see where our Extropian ideals fit into
<br>
the challenging new world into which we have been thrust.
<br>
<p>I think the biggest problem is the idea that the end justifies the means.
<br>
We have a goal of an Extropian future.  But what we are sometimes
<br>
forgetting is that how we get there is important, too.
<br>
<p>I like Charlie Stross's hopeful suggestion that the Arab states and
<br>
especially Afghanistan may be able to move towards a more open society.
<br>
But is it proper to impose this social structure by force from the
<br>
outside, as we did in Japan?  The end is justifiable, and at least in
<br>
the case of Japan I think the means can be justified, with the possible
<br>
exception of the use of nuclear bombs (please, let's not debate that
<br>
specific issue).
<br>
<p>However, would it be right for us to go into Afghanistan, kill the
<br>
Taliban leaders, and then try to get some kind of parliament operating?
<br>
Even supposing this were possible?  I don't know.  The end is a good one,
<br>
but imposing it from outside is going to be costly.  We can't neglect
<br>
those costs and just look at the hoped-for end result.
<br>
