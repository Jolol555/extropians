<p><p><em>&gt;There are not any transhumans yet but many who aspire to be so. 
</em><br>
To so aspire is to aspire for the unseen, to aspire to make a
<br>
vision of what can be real.  Sometimes some of us mistakenly
<br>
think the making real means throwing away almost everything we
<br>
cannot measure and treat with technology directly.  An
<br>
understandable but imho self-defeating development.&lt;
<br>
<p>Samantha, I'm only responding because I enjoy reading your posts and your above-statement is not correct.  There are many, many transhumans today.  Some transhumans are fully aware of their transition, yet some may not be aware of it.  Please remember a transhuman is a human in transition from being exclusively a biological being to merging with technology on our way to becoming posthuman.  Herein, a person who has any sort of upgrad or inplant is basically a transhuman.  For example, while my own upgrade is less obvious than most, I am a transhuman. My mother has a replacement hip and she is a transhuman.  According to FM-2030, &quot;Transhumans are a new evolutionary being resulting from the monumental breakthroughs of the late twentieth century,&quot; the reference he makes pertains augmentation of the human body through techology.  What he did leave out was a psychological transition.  (However he expressed his ideology in many of his books.) Those who have upgrades or add-ons are indeed transhuman walking around <br>
and across the world today. 
<br>
<p>I think what you may be refering to is a &quot;posthuman&quot;.  There are no posthumans today and we can only imagine what a posthuman will be.
<br>
