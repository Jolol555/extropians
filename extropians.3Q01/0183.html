Hi, all! I am new to the list, and feel both elated
<br>
and somewhat intimidated to be here. After all, I am
<br>
no scientist or PhD in anything, just a violin teacher
<br>
in a small town in Colorado--it is great to be in your
<br>
company. :)
<br>
<p>However, I am a violin teacher wondering what to do
<br>
for my next career. I spent 20 years in graphic design
<br>
and communications, returned to school for a music
<br>
degree, now teach some very gifted minds in a private
<br>
studio (the greatest challenge in this being
<br>
convincing them all that they can and should be better
<br>
than I), and find myself thinking that ten years from
<br>
now I should be doing something else, for I will have
<br>
contributed great amounts already to the muse and will
<br>
likely have very little to offer once the freshness of
<br>
my offering is long stale. Anything after that is just
<br>
earning money. I cry, &quot;Disservice!&quot; at myself in the
<br>
mirror.
<br>
<p>I couldn't tell whether Walford or Hayflick said this
<br>
in the article, but:
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm not going to be satisfied with only going to be
<br>
80 or 85 just because a lot of other people don't know
<br>
what to do with their lives,&quot; he replied.
<br>
<p>is a wonderful response to a lot of objections to
<br>
extended lifespans. My parents tried to teach me that
<br>
I would graduate from college, work for the same
<br>
company all my life, then retire at a predetermined
<br>
age and get the hell out of the way (polluting the
<br>
skies with continuous exhaust from an oversized tin
<br>
can, the windows from which I would gawk at all the
<br>
beauty in the country that is being destroyed by
<br>
pollution--ha!). It's a good thing I have no intention
<br>
of doing this, or of collecting Social Security--I
<br>
don't believe they are going to be possible for me.
<br>
Could be wrong.
<br>
<p>These parents smoked and drank themselves out of a
<br>
long life--their parents and grandparents lived to be
<br>
near 100, and bore their children late in life. I also
<br>
had my children late but do not risk my life with
<br>
pollutants of the body, and feel I have not lived half
<br>
my life yet--I am 44.
<br>
<p>But just as some of us feel that we don't have the
<br>
right or reason to live long, others feel we don't
<br>
have the right or reason to die when we choose. Dr.
<br>
Kavorkian is still in jail, I believe, and I still
<br>
hear in my social circles that &quot;so-and'so had no right
<br>
to kill himself even though his life was unbearable by
<br>
any standards, blah blah blah...God...blah blah
<br>
blah...the Bible says...nothing is worth giving up
<br>
your life for except God and Country...&quot;
<br>
<p>Don't know if this is worth commenting on, but have at
<br>
it! Thanks for a great mailing list!
<br>
<p>Merriss
