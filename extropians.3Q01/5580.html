<p><em>&gt;Do you know the Enneagram stuff? I'm not sure it's worth a whole lot, but
</em><br>
I'd
<br>
<em>&gt;guess that I habitually have operated in &quot;#6&quot;. Any guesses about other list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;participants?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For the skeptical and Enneagram-impaired: Enneagram minuses include an
</em><br>
association
<br>
<em>&gt;with Gurdjieff; the pluses include that I find a personal correspondence
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt;&quot;#6&quot; and my otherwise peculiar-seeming &quot;loyalist/paranoid&quot; drives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hey. Given that there are 9 Enneagram types, 12 natal horological astrology
</em><br>
signs,
<br>
<em>&gt;and 16 Myers-Briggs types, which is the most scientific? :)
</em><br>
<p>I couldn't guess much about other list participants, though I expect that,
<br>
on the Myers-Briggs typology, the list has a disproportionately large number
<br>
of INTJs. I am one of them.
<br>
<p>On the Enneagram, which I'd never heard of, I'm afraid, I find I am a type
<br>
5, backed up equally by types 3 and 8.
<br>
<p>Astrologically, I am a Leo.
<br>
<p>My experience is that the Myers-Briggs thing gives very convincing results
<br>
when I see friends take it. As you'd expect, I don't believe in astrology.
<br>
Judgment reserved on the Enneagram.
<br>
<p>Do you have theories about other frequent participants? If it comes to that,
<br>
what would you have guessed about me if I hadn't just revealed all?
<br>
<p>Cheers
<br>
<p>Russell
