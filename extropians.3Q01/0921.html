<p><em>&gt;It may be good for you in the short term, but in the long term it may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;handicap
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you. An analogy is morphine. It may be good for you during a surgical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;treatment, but watch out for the addictive danger.
</em><br>
<p>I don't often tell people what they should do, because I'm not in their
<br>
shoes. Using 'you' in this context is inappropriate. You are not me.
<br>
<p>I do science every day. I wake up in the morning and do science. I go
<br>
to sleep at night, and I do science. I dream science in my dreams.
<br>
Do you do science 24 hours a day?
<br>
<p>I could deconstruct everything around me to explain all and everything,
<br>
but I am not interested in understanding everything.. just what I am
<br>
interested to know, clear? There are only so many hours in the day.
<br>
But maybe some day when I'm 10 million years old  I will have
<br>
understood what I what I want to understand about the Universe.
<br>
<p>You can interpret my words in whatever way you want, it doesn't matter
<br>
much to me. I don't agree with your interpretation, and in my opinion
<br>
you went off the deep end, misinterpreted what I wrote and put it
<br>
in your own context that doesn't jibe with mine. I only did my best
<br>
to try to show some things from my view.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, there is more than science in life. The joy in playing music.
<br>
Spending time with those I care about. Discovering what I'm good at, and
<br>
seeing
<br>
if there's a need for those things to try to improve the world, in some way.
<br>
I'm always learning from what I see, test, observe, and make connections
<br>
with. Some things I understand. Some things I don't understand. But I'm
<br>
not a rabid scientific desconstructionalist, sorry..
<br>
<p>So then, stopping here on this topic. I have a dissertation defense to
<br>
prepare for.
<br>
