This is mostly for Spike and Eric.
<br>
<p>Spike, to get an idea of the size of things I'm envisioning
<br>
reread my message re: &quot;NASA Ends Project Intended to Replace
<br>
Space Shuttle&quot; from March 11th.  See:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q01/0426.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q01/0426.html</a>
<br>
or
<br>
<a href="http://forum.javien.com/future/XMLmessage.php?id=id::OUxbTWAK-UTsD-OC1p-FyNT-SHFpDTxwTHRM">http://forum.javien.com/future/XMLmessage.php?id=id::OUxbTWAK-UTsD-OC1p-FyNT-SHFpDTxwTHRM</a>
<br>
(you gotta love those Javien URLs....)
<br>
<p>That should let you do estimates on the size of the engineering
<br>
team required.  Working at a sub-normal engineering scale
<br>
might make it tougher however.
<br>
<p>[I'll note as an interesting aside to the list how its very
<br>
strange to me that a message posted in March ended up in
<br>
the 2nd Quarter of the archives....  Hmmmm...]
<br>
<p>Now, responding to Eric...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think we talk a lot but hardly see any action.
</em><br>
<p>Actually there is quite a bit of work going on in microrobotics
<br>
at JPL, Los Alamos, MIT and other places I'm sure.  As far as
<br>
&quot;coordination&quot; goes, what you really need is something like
<br>
&quot;robo-wars&quot; in the super-light-weight class of &lt; 0.1 kg or so.
<br>
That would push the technology development along the scales I'm
<br>
thinking about.
<br>
<p>Regarding the MEMS probe URL you posted, that isn't exactly what
<br>
I had in mind.  Yes, that type of thing will be great for
<br>
monitoring neural networks, but I was speaking of Micro-Electrical
<br>
Mechanical Systems in a more general sense of simply the
<br>
&quot;MEMS&quot; size scale which is typically 1-100 microns.  You
<br>
need to build things at those scales to get the probe weight
<br>
down to 1-10 Kg as I had proposed in the URL I cite above.
<br>
For example &quot;Microrobots for Micrometer-Size Objects in
<br>
Aqueous Media: Potential Tools for Single-Cell Manipulation&quot;
<br>
Jager, E. W. H. et al, Science 288:2335-2338 (30 Jun 2000).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; we will only find it ethically appropriate [snip] to allow human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings to ascend to the transhuman level on their own free will. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can do this with the colony approach - far-away and independent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but accessible
</em><br>
<p>Of course, but you are leaving out what happens when mere humans
<br>
are no longer at the top of the evolutionary heap in &quot;known space&quot;.
<br>
The capacity of the solar system allows *each* human to up-evolve
<br>
by a factor of at least a *thousand trillion* times (10^15).  
<br>
So now you have a very different picture of &quot;reality&quot;.  Say those
<br>
people who are still &quot;humans&quot; or anywhere in the sub-overlord
<br>
stage want to go colonize alpha centauri.  You have to ask
<br>
permission from the overlords and receive some kind of grant
<br>
of ownership of the property.  Why?  Because with your limited
<br>
resources, you have no guarantee that by the time you get there,
<br>
the overlords might not have changed their mind, sent out a
<br>
faster ship and have colonized the system with their agents
<br>
before you arrive.  Are you going to risk going there only to
<br>
discover there isn't anything left to colonize?  The overlords
<br>
may have no interest in colonizing the distant system when you
<br>
ask them (because of the diminished value of information at
<br>
a distance I mentioned) but they may also have no reason to
<br>
grant you rights to the system in case they decide at some
<br>
future point they might want it.  I think advanced civilizations
<br>
*may* expand but they do so only very slowly when close encounters
<br>
between solar systems occur.  Then you get a bacterial-like division
<br>
of the civilization across both solar systems.
<br>
<p>I doubt overlords are going to let humans or sub-superintelligences
<br>
going to run around colonizing things that they may want to
<br>
occupy when the time is right in the future.  The situation is
<br>
probably somewhat like the situation on the Earth today where
<br>
everything is effectively &quot;occupied&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To assume that we cannot break the speed of light barrier into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the long term future would not sound wise.
</em><br>
<p>To have a discussion where one can modify the laws of physics
<br>
at will doesn't sound wise either.  As Damien pointed out in
<br>
The Spike, regarding my ideas about the Matrioshka Brain:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He (me) is remarkably conservative in his projections, refusing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(like Frank Tipler) to permit wild or exotic physics unknown
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to today's science.  That might turn out to be an error, but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is a methodological choice a scientist is almost obliged
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to adopt; otherwise *anything* becomes possible and no
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proposal is interesting or testable.&quot;
<br>
<p>This appears in list discussions as my infamous &quot;No Magic Physics&quot; (NMP)
<br>
comments.  I'm fond of a quote that appears in one of the SETI conference
<br>
proceedings when someone in the audience commented to a speaker --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, but if you give the theoreticians long enough they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can explain *anything*&quot;.
<br>
The speaker's response was to agree.  I prefer to do my speculations
<br>
on dry land rather than in the swamp.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would seem unwise to trust any and all cosmic visitors with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bona fide intentions, for who knows if they have any motives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as reproduction of themselves at all costs.
</em><br>
<p>When all the brown dwarfs in the galaxy are gone and the easy
<br>
pickings from the matter &amp; energy tree seem to be getting scarce
<br>
is when I think this principle *may* come into play.  For a
<br>
fully developed solar system to become concerned, what has to
<br>
be approaching has to have relatively greater mass/energy
<br>
resources at its disposal so it seems unlikely that it is
<br>
going to appear on your galactic doorstep &quot;unannounced&quot;
<br>
giving you lots of time to prepare a reception.
<br>
<p>I'll try to spend some time later looking up references for
<br>
&quot;berserker&quot;.  The Javien search option
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://forum.javien.com/future/search.php">http://forum.javien.com/future/search.php</a>)
<br>
turns up some recent hits and the Extropian archive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/</a>)
<br>
gets a few more.  But they both seem to be missing the major
<br>
discussions on this (lord... 20 years after the invention
<br>
of the PC we *still* can't get things indexed properly...).
