<p>Yes: it's sensationalist tosh, written by a journalist with virtually
<br>
no background in biology.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, they're very possibly right.
<br>
<p>The number of human nvCJD cases in the UK is doubling on an annual
<br>
basis, but as the human population has only been exposed to infection for
<br>
about fifteen years -- and the incubation period of CJD is measured in
<br>
decades -- it's unclear what this means. We might be near the peak of
<br>
a bell-shaped curve ... or right down on the slowly-rising tail of an
<br>
epidemic of monstrous proportions.
<br>
<p>As for the rest of the world, it turns out that nvCJD has travelled to 
<br>
many places where the authorities are taking the same attitude to it that
<br>
they took to AIDS in the early 1980's. In France, for example, the number
<br>
of cattle destroyed because of rabies increased by an order of magnitude
<br>
in the early 1990's. It turns out that farmers whose cattle contracted
<br>
BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) would have them destroyed without
<br>
compensation, but there was a compensation scheme in place for cattle
<br>
destroyed under suspicion of rabies; as BSE can resemble rabies in cattle,
<br>
it's not hard to see what was going on.
<br>
<p>Professor Lacey's worst-case analysis is that he expects up to 70%
<br>
of the population of the UK to die of nvCJD. Lacey has an axe to grind
<br>
but he's also one of the most eminent epidemiologists in the UK, and most
<br>
of the polish on his axe has to do with MAFF (the Ministry of Agriculture,
<br>
Fisheries and Food) having tried to gag him in the early nineties when
<br>
he first began speaking publicly about BSE and humans. We know that this
<br>
prion disease can cross-infect from cattle to sheep, mink, cats, mice,
<br>
and other mammals, unlike the scrapie prior. 
<br>
<p>There's been a fair amount of coverage (in New Scientist) of various 
<br>
countries and their defenses against BSE. The USA comes out bottom on the
<br>
list, and ISTR suggestions that there's probably a big contagion pool in
<br>
your agricultural sector.
<br>
<p>This doesn't mean you're going to die, but switching to eating chicken,
<br>
or Argentinian or British beef (now guaranteed BSE-free) might be 
<br>
sensible.
