Natasha - That's very frightening, but I am glad that they were able to
<br>
catch it early and give you good treatment.  I know a number of people
<br>
who have survived cancer and while you can't ignore it, you can certainly
<br>
still look forward to a long and healthy life.
<br>
<p>In a sense, everyone has cancer.  We've got small cell colonies all
<br>
over our bodies that are misbehaving, growing, mutating, trying to hit
<br>
the right combination so that they can spread.  It's like weeds in the
<br>
garden, life wants to grow.  The only problem is that we are the garden
<br>
and the weeds can kill us.
<br>
<p>Your ideas about nutrition and drinking plenty of water sound good,
<br>
as well as frequent tests.  Plus in the next decade or so they will
<br>
undoubtedly have better treatments and screening.  It is great that you
<br>
are able to be hopeful and positive as you move ahead with your life.
<br>
<p>Hal
