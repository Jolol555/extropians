<p>Here's a professional theologian's review of
<br>
RELIGION EXPLAINED: THE EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF RELIGIOUS THOUGHT, by Pascal
<br>
Boyer.
<br>
<p>THE WASHINGTON TIMES
<br>
Trying to dismiss religion, starting with growth of ancestors' brains
<br>
<p>For a long time evolutionary biology stayed away from religion. Its proponents
<br>
were typically reluctant to apply their Darwinian insights to something so
<br>
apparently sui generis as the experience of the sacred. But the characteristic
<br>
drive of science is to approach its subject matter without appealing to any
<br>
supposed nonnatural causes. Why not also look at religion naturalistically?
<br>
The
<br>
new science of evolutionary psychology, a derivative of sociobiology, proposes
<br>
to &quot;naturalize&quot; our understanding of religion completely by way of
<br>
neo-Darwinian explanation. We can now account for the persistence of the gods,
<br>
so goes this confident new program, without assuming either the primacy of
<br>
cultural factors or the reality of the sacred.
<br>
<p>Evolutionary psychology claims that the ways in which the human brain responds
<br>
to the world were designed by evolution during the Pleistocene (one to two
<br>
million years ago) specifically for a hunter and gatherer type of existence.
<br>
The brain comprises distinguishable systems designed to cope with specific
<br>
problems related to survival during our emergence as one species among others.
<br>
<p>People today carry around the same kind of brain that our Paleolithic
<br>
ancestors
<br>
had; and because this organ was shaped by adaptive evolutionary processes in
<br>
radically different circumstances from those we face today, contemporary
<br>
humans
<br>
often have trouble adapting to the new environments that subsequent cultural
<br>
developments have brought about.
<br>
<p>To evolutionary psychologists one of the more puzzling responses the human
<br>
brain has made to the world is its tendency to create illusions of the sacred
<br>
and other &quot;counterintuitive&quot; religious ideas garnished with strange rituals
<br>
and
<br>
bizarre beliefs. Why, they ask, has religion accompanied us so persistently,
<br>
apparently since the very beginning of Cro-Magnon humanity?
<br>
<p>Darwinian anthropologists generally agree that religion is an irritatingly
<br>
obsolete but stubbornly ineradicable human tendency. Our religious
<br>
orientation,
<br>
though clearly out of date, is so deeply rooted and so pervasive that it
<br>
cannot
<br>
be understood simply as an ephemeral cultural concoction. Religion must be
<br>
connected, instead, to the specific kind of brains we have, to cerebral
<br>
systems
<br>
that developed in us because they served the cause of gene survival during the
<br>
course of early human evolution.
<br>
<p>The latest example of this approach is Pascal Boyer's &quot;Religion Explained: The
<br>
Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought.&quot; The book's immodest title,
<br>
together
<br>
with its philosophical assumptions and convoluted argumentation, calls to mind
<br>
Daniel Dennett's materialist manifesto &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot; (which, by
<br>
the
<br>
way, did not explain consciousness).
<br>
<p>Mr. Boyer, a cultural anthropologist and the recent recipient of a prestigious
<br>
academic chair at Washington University, St. Louis, tries here to be a
<br>
faithful
<br>
disciple of Mr. Dennett and the British evolutionist Richard Dawkins. So it is
<br>
not surprising to hear from him that Darwinian explanations, in combination
<br>
with a few other ideas from cognitive science, can settle once and for all the
<br>
question of why we are religious.
<br>
<p>Our attachment to gods and other facets of religion is simply the consequence
<br>
of our Pleistocene ancestors' having developed brains with highly specialized
<br>
survival functions. These brains, Mr. Boyer admits, possess no specifically
<br>
religious instinct. In fact, in itself religion is an &quot;airy nothing&quot; that
<br>
endures only because it is parasitic on several identifiable cognitive
<br>
systems.
<br>
But the brain systems that give domicile to religious imaginings themselves
<br>
evolved at all only because they served the cause of gene-survival.
<br>
<p>One of these systems, for example, is that of predator detection. During the
<br>
evolution of our species, organisms whose brains were not good at detecting
<br>
predators obviously could not adapt, and so they proved to be unworthy
<br>
vehicles
<br>
for gene-survival. Those that were good at detecting predators, on the other
<br>
hand, survived and passed on genes that give us the same predator-detecting
<br>
cerebral properties we possess now.
<br>
<p>A brain endowed with the capacity to detect unseen predators, Mr. Boyer's
<br>
argument continues, is one that can function readily as a host for parasitic
<br>
religious ideas. It is only a small step, after all, from our being constantly
<br>
vigilant for hidden predators, to our looking habitually for hidden agencies
<br>
of
<br>
all kinds, including spirits and gods.
<br>
<p>Natural selection caused our brains to develop in such a way that we would
<br>
eventually search for supernatural explanations which, like concealed
<br>
predators, are taken to be quite real even though they remain out of sight.
<br>
Other cognitive and emotive systems are also involved in the fabrication of
<br>
religion, but the author's general approach should be clear enough from this
<br>
example.
<br>
<p>Although Mr. Boyer avoids the more direct language of Mr. Dawkins, his point
<br>
is
<br>
finally the same. Religion is a virus. We are a religious species simply
<br>
because our ancestors were genetically endowed with brains whose various
<br>
systems became, by accident, suitable hosts for illusions of the sacred.
<br>
<p>The book is filled with interesting ideas and observations about religion. The
<br>
author, it should be noted, is much more subtle than Mr. Dawkins and most of
<br>
the evolutionists he emulates. He is also able to use strands of cognitive
<br>
science other than evolutionary biology, and his book is reflective of
<br>
considerable field work, especially among the Fang tribe in Cameroon.
<br>
<p>If we could get past the philosophical materialism that shades Mr. Boyer's
<br>
study we might learn a good bit about some of the physical and evolutionary
<br>
conditions that incline our species to be religious. Neo-Darwinism, including
<br>
evolutionary psychology, may provide one layer in a whole hierarchy of
<br>
explanations needed to account for religion richly. But for all we know,
<br>
another important dimension of a fertile explanation of religion may be the
<br>
one
<br>
that religious persons themselves have given, namely, that &quot;the sacred&quot; has in
<br>
some way broken into their awareness, not surprisingly by employing natural
<br>
cognitive systems.
<br>
<p>That God or the gods could have anything to do with why we are religious is,
<br>
of
<br>
course, not a hypothesis that scientists as such should entertain. Neither,
<br>
though, is the opposite belief, namely, that science has ruled out such a
<br>
possibility. The problem with this book, as is true of most other applications
<br>
of evolutionary psychology, is the extravagance of its claims to explanatory
<br>
adequacy. That the author condescendingly refers to religion as &quot;airy nothing&quot;
<br>
betrays his own scientistic beliefs, in spite of the fact that nothing he says
<br>
in the book logically warrants such a label. Here again the absence of
<br>
methodological modesty sabotages whatever good results might come from a
<br>
Darwinian perspective.
<br>
<p>Not unexpectedly, Mr. Boyer's debunking of religion ends up debunking itself.
<br>
His own explanation-detecting system, after all, presumably employs the same
<br>
cognitive &quot;mechanism&quot; that arose by selection for predator detection thousands
<br>
of years ago. He too looks for &quot;hidden agencies,&quot; in this case to explain the
<br>
troubling persistence of religion. And like his religious ancestors he finds
<br>
the actors behind the scene possessing the form of mythicized homunculus-like
<br>
subjects - the ones known today as &quot;selfish genes.&quot;
<br>
<p>Like the gods of religion the mindless and lifeless segments of DNA known as
<br>
genes are portrayed by much contemporary biology as competing, cooperating and
<br>
battling subjects striving for immortality. What is to prevent us, then, from
<br>
concluding that the quasi-religious ideas of Mr. Boyer's book are not also
<br>
&quot;airy nothing&quot; parasitically feeding upon the author's own adaptive cognitive
<br>
system?

regressive force now operating in society.
