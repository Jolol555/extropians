<em>&gt; Reason, I take it that the first set of guidelines are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things you are already doing along the same lines, so
</em><br>
<p>Steaming along slowly; I have a day job, just like most people :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1) donate content:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By donating content, you mean content from people like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pearson and Shaw (is this what you mean by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accredited), or lay people like me who use the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life-extension &quot;supplements,&quot; or both?
</em><br>
<p>I mean useful content -- which could be either. IMHO, the best sorts of
<br>
content are:
<br>
<p>a) articles from &quot;names&quot; -- people who are known or have cachet.
<br>
b) how-to and opinion articles on life extension from the laity [:)] that
<br>
tend to illustrate more strongly to joe public exactly how easy it is for
<br>
him to help/help himself. Look at the articles on www.lef.org -- there are
<br>
some excellent first person accounts on there that have motivated and
<br>
informed me considerably.
<br>
c) call to arms articles from anyone
<br>
<p>Feel free to add to this list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The reason I ask is I have just been assigned an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; editorial position for a &quot;supplement&quot; company in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UK (so much for just being a violin teacher), and this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is read by several people in the medical industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there, and probably by some life extension researchers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well. I may have access to content on all sides of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the issue--research, 'scripts, government, laws,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumers.
</em><br>
<p>All suitable donations and permissions greatly appreciated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is there a chace you or someone else could do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal research instead of using non-profit advice?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Access to a law library is about all that would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary. I realize ancient English is difficult at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best to understand, but not impossible.
</em><br>
<p>I do perform a lot of my own legal research, but there's only so far that a
<br>
non-lawyer should go in the U.S. Even in something as simple as writing
<br>
nonprofit bylaws, you quickly run into legal gray areas (usually due to
<br>
poorly defined requirements on the part of some agency or other) that may
<br>
cause you serious trouble later on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Aren't there others on this list with good legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources?
</em><br>
<p>A question I would echo.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5) be cheerleaders; advocate, get your friends to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visit the site, tell everyone you know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Important point. Purchase email lists from others? I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know I get on people's email lists and get told I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signed up for this newsletter or that quote-of-the-day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I did no such thing. I don't get irritated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I have found some VERY good sources of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what-not out there because of it.
</em><br>
<p>I'm more in favor of usenet, banner exchanges, and using existing
<br>
sympathetic mailing lists and bulletin boards to spread the word. Takes less
<br>
effort, and kicks off viral marketing effects more rapidly. I've been doing
<br>
the online publicity thing for a while and in a number of arenas, but you
<br>
never stop learning -- all suggestions gratefully acccepted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Email lists could be gotten from the companies that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supply antiaging supplements, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Cutting friendly exchanges with people like VRP (vrpcentral.net) and LEF
<br>
(lef.org) to get mentioned in their newsletters is a good thing to do. They
<br>
wouldn't give up their mailing lists -- it's a violation of stated privacy
<br>
policies and rude to their customers. Bad for business -- but getting
<br>
mentions in their newsletters is a good thing.
<br>
<p>It's always in these company's interests to make nice with life extension
<br>
activism groups; great source of new and dedicated customers for them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As far as the list coordinating efforts, it sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like most of them are involved in many things, so I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know if it could be a fulltime job for anyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really. But if everyone could allocate two hours per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; week that's a lot of manhours dedicated.
</em><br>
<p>The money just really isn't there to full-time anyone on the project until
<br>
you have a sizable community. Donations would go on funding projects
<br>
utilizing volunteer time rather than on paying administration.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You said a list is a bad way to coordinate more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one topic at a time, but isn't the singluar topic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support of antiaging research and putting the screws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to governments to let it happen? Sounds pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes and no. As I was pointing out in a private e-mail yesterday,
<br>
putting the screws to governments is the first instinct of anyone motivated
<br>
to do something (certainly over here in the US). I don't think I live in a
<br>
world in which I have to encourage anyone to put the screws to governments
<br>
instead of following some other course of action.
<br>
<p>The problem, as I see it, is that there aren't enough people ready to do
<br>
something. That is the problem that I want to aim at; the essential shift in
<br>
attitude towards aging, life extension and death. People must stop viewing
<br>
aging as natural and view it as a condition that can one day be cured. They
<br>
must stop seeing these things as inevitable and start seeing them as
<br>
reversible. The false conceptions of life extension that people have must be
<br>
dispelled. Options to do something, to contribute something, must be given
<br>
to the man in the street.
<br>
<p>In essence, it's an education thing for the masses and the media, plus
<br>
providing a constructive outlet for everyone who wants to help, in no matter
<br>
how small a way. It took 10-15-20 years of hard-fought activism to get
<br>
somewhere useful with AIDs...but those are the sorts of results we want to
<br>
aim for in public awareness and public contributions.
<br>
<p>Putting the screws to governments is a natural outgrowth of this education;
<br>
a second-order effect, if you like.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, Reason, our lives would get extended, too, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are right. And possibly more so than most others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because--and this is just opinion mentally supported
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by word of mouth--philanthropists (which I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanists are the cream of) have the joy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helping others instead of letting god sort it out. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read years ago that it is like petting animals, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more you do the more it extends your life and quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of it.
</em><br>
<p>I should probably mention that altruism is not at the top of my list of
<br>
reasons for doing all of this. :) The rest of the human race gets dragged
<br>
along with us because it can't be done without them.
