Miriam said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I recently opted for poverty in order to extend myself. I quit my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;job to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;try and get on with a peculiar passion of mine. &lt;large snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have noticed that I either earn money OR have the time to do the things I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want -- never both. So I have decided for the latter and carry on the fine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tradition of the starving artist.  :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I've had a financially comfortable career (though not always comfortable in 
<br>
other ways, by any means) as an academic, a labour relations advocate, and 
<br>
ultimately in professional legal practice. My writing - fiction, criticism, 
<br>
journalism on issues of philosophy and public affairs, and academic articles 
<br>
- only has to make me a bit of pocket money... at least until now. And, in 
<br>
truth, I have sufficient investments built up at this point that I don't 
<br>
ever expect to be any kind of &quot;starving artist&quot; as Miriam describes herself.
<br>
<p>However, it is certainly my experience that there's a tension between having 
<br>
time to do things and having money freely available.
<br>
<p>I'm actually planning to leave my &quot;day job&quot; in September and spend at least 
<br>
two years on other priorities: travel, writing, study, spending time with 
<br>
friends and family. Having made my (admittedly very modest!!) fortune here 
<br>
in my 40s I don't see the point of making too much more. However, I see a 
<br>
lot of point in further self-development, creativity, companionship and 
<br>
collegiality, and the joy of a good fight or two in a few decent causes.
<br>
<p>Cheers
<br>
