<em>&gt; I have one big advantage in these discussions, at least in terms of tolerance, that goes
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; day at lunch witnessed this certain kid arguing with four other kids at the same time...,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and wiping them out!   Next to him, they sounded like children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was 1960, and this boy was for Kennedy, &quot;the lesser of two evils&quot;, as he explained.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started to debate with him, and almost immediately he lost interest in what the other kids
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were saying, and they wandered away.  He was the complete agnostic liberal, and I, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete Christian conservative.  But what I am most proud of was that we each almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *instantaneously* perceived that the other was neither stupid, nor ignorant, nor evil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our arguments went on for five years, almost until the very last year of high school.
</em><br>
<p>Don't you love that?  I had a best friend very much like this. 
<br>
He talked me out of being religious when I was 14 and I talked
<br>
him out of being pro-Vietnam and playing wargames by mail and
<br>
wire with people in the Pentagon when he was 17.  We taught each
<br>
other debating and thinking skills and how to play chess.   In
<br>
our junior year we did a joint project for humanities class.  We
<br>
dug up all the apologetics and arguments for God and demolished
<br>
them one by one.  As this was the heart of the Bible Belt we
<br>
then spend twice as long dealing with the objections of our
<br>
classmates and teacher.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From the very first sentences, our debates never descended to name-calling or real anger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There was exasperation, &quot;how could you *possibly* believe that?&quot;, and even sarcasm.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tone was always civil.  One thing that emerged after a few months was that we were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each being prepped nightly by our fathers, who were committed ideologues.  But we were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite proud of the fact that because our fathers each was extremely excitable, emotional,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and intolerant, we were able to rationally discuss the issues in ways that we knew that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they would were incapable of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Both of us were very different from our parents by the time we
<br>
met at age 13 or so.  Except he had the advantage of growing up
<br>
in a home where &quot;intellectual&quot; was not considering an insulting
<br>
term.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Steve, Eve and I were the three outsider brains of our
<br>
highschool.  We had taken all the interesting courses too early
<br>
and our parents for some stupid reason didn't want to send us to
<br>
college when we were 16, so the three of us got put in &quot;special
<br>
study&quot; classes where we basically spent a lot of time sharing
<br>
ideas and interests and having long deep discussions.  Steve and
<br>
I were both math people so before we ran out of course to take
<br>
we would rack up the most math honors relative to each other. 
<br>
But that didn't last long.  He was a far better and more ardent
<br>
student than I but I had a more deft and intuitive grasp of the
<br>
material.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We became each other's model of what a pretty-far-left liberal or a pretty-far-right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative should be like.  In later years, I'd notice some inconsistency in what some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leftists were doing or saying, such as those who demanded amnesty after committing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civil-rights type law violation, and say to myself, &quot;What?  Not even Davis would say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that!&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>Steve was the white-socks, conservative hyper-rational
<br>
power-geek long before anyone got any points for that.  I was
<br>
the wild-eyed theorist, poet and mystically leaning
<br>
proto-hippie.  But we learned to hear each other out and we
<br>
learned to respect each other's views, intelligence and
<br>
sincerity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Far from seeing each other as mean-spirited or stupid, instead---because of the obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symmetries of our positions---there arose the amazing platonic vision of the political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spectrum.  We knew of famous people to the left of him and to the right of me.  There was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously a deep difference in values or visions, but we never lost faith that we could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually get somewhere in our discussions.  Sometimes we did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm glad our debates finally ended.  I'd probably still be a Christian if they hadn't.
</em><br>
<p><p>Ours didn't end until we had switched positions with one another
<br>
on almost everything.  :)
