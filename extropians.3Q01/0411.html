<em>&gt; You cannot, thereby, both believe in God (or ETs or anything else that

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'll go along with that. Furturmore, you don't have to be an extropian to be a
<br>
non-theist, as Richard Dawkins demonstrates in the following article. Note
<br>
also that he has eased up on debunking religionism in favor of promoting
<br>
science. Which is what I think I'll do more of from now on.

<br>
Need someone to deny the existence of God? Then Richard Dawkins is the man to
<br>
ask. Thomas Sutcliffe meets the best-selling scientist with an answer for
<br>
everything (almost)
<br>
<p>&quot;Anyone would think I was the only atheist around,&quot; says Richard Dawkins, in
<br>
tones of mildly frustrated grievance. He isn't, of course, but if you happen
<br>
to be in the market for an atheist, there's little doubt that the Charles
<br>
Simonyi Professor in the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University
<br>
is the market leader – a Rolls-Royce of anti-clerical argument, whose
<br>
contradictions and counter-propositions slam shut with a perfectly engineered
<br>
thunk.
<br>
<p>For the moment, though, he's happy to let the business go elsewhere. &quot;You've
<br>
no idea how often I turn down invitations to do that kind of controversial
<br>
stuff,&quot; he continues. &quot;Time and again broadcasters will be looking for
<br>
somebody to say something negative about God and they'll come to me, and
<br>
nowadays I say no almost always.&quot;
<br>
<p>This reticence is not the result of second thoughts, incidentally, but of a
<br>
growing anxiety that his observations on religious faith are obscuring
<br>
something that matters a great deal more to him – the promotion of scientific
<br>
method, about which he will speak with a proselytising passion. Whether he
<br>
likes it or not, it has made him not just the most successful populariser of
<br>
evolutionary theory in the country, but also a figurehead for scientific
<br>
scepticism. He has written with genuine indignation about the bad press given
<br>
to Thomas – the one Disciple who wanted to subject Christ's claims to some
<br>
kind of clinical verification.
<br>
<p>Which is why the publisher of Snake Oil and Other Preoccupations, a book about
<br>
alternative medicine that John Diamond was working on when he died, naturally
<br>
turned to Dawkins for a preface – and why he is sitting in his garden in north
<br>
Oxford talking, among other things, about homeopathy and religion.
<br>
<p>We are seated at a vast slab of Devonian Jurassic stone – a roughly hewn
<br>
square, 10ft by 10ft, resting on three carved- stone Platonic solids, the kind
<br>
of prodigious jeu d'esprit you can treat yourself to if your books have become
<br>
global bestsellers. The public appetite that made them so, Dawkins is ready to
<br>
concede, may not be entirely divorced from the religious instinct that
<br>
prevailed in Victorian times.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is absolutely true that the ecological niche that was filled by religion
<br>
is now filled by science, and perhaps above all by the evolutionary science
<br>
that I cling to myself,&quot; he says – that word &quot;cling&quot; so hesitantly voiced that
<br>
I have to rewind the tape several times to make it out. &quot;I do feel that
<br>
science is absolutely not a religion when you mean it is held on faith, but it
<br>
fills the same ecological niche as religion in the sense that it answers the
<br>
same kind of questions as religion, in past centuries, was alleged to answer.
<br>
<p>&quot;So I have respect for religious people in so far as they are asking important
<br>
questions. They want to know why we exist and why the world exists, and they
<br>
don't just want to know who's going to win Wimbledon and what's for dinner.
<br>
And to that extent I have great respect. But I get irritated at the way those
<br>
deep and fundamental and mysterious questions are hijacked – because I think
<br>
that science can answer most of them, if not all of them.&quot;
<br>
<p>The &quot;if not all&quot;, by the way, is not a revised bid for comprehensive
<br>
explanation, but a concession that some mysteries will always remain. The
<br>
&quot;why?&quot; question that is often thrown at Dawkins in public lectures (&quot;everyone
<br>
who asks it, asks it in the tone of voice that suggests that no one has ever
<br>
asked it before&quot;) is, to his mind, irrelevant: &quot;The mere fact that a question
<br>
can be put – the mere fact that the English word &quot;why&quot; exists – doesn't mean
<br>
that it's a legitimate question.&quot;
<br>
<p>Darwinians ask meaningful &quot;why&quot; questions, he says. Those that ask &quot;why is
<br>
this leaf this particular shape?&quot; or &quot;why does this animal walk like this?&quot;.
<br>
What about, &quot;why are humans so credulous?&quot; I ask. So happy to pay through the
<br>
nose for an aura massage or crystal healing. Mustn't gullibility have an
<br>
evolutionary explanation too?
<br>
<p>&quot;I would put it back to childhood and say that there's a Darwinian survival
<br>
value in children believing what their elders tell them, because the world is
<br>
too dangerous a place and it takes too long to learn what you need to learn to
<br>
survive,&quot; Dawkins replies. &quot;You've got to have a rule of thumb that's built
<br>
into the nervous system that says 'Believe what you're told'. And once you've
<br>
got a rule of thumb like that, it's like having a computer, which is
<br>
vulnerable to viruses. A good computer will run whatever programme you stick
<br>
in it, whether it's beneficial or not.&quot;
<br>
<p>The vulnerability of children to such parental downloads is one source of
<br>
Dawkins' fierce opposition to religious schools (he recently described
<br>
government plans to encourage the spread of single-faith schools as &quot;evil&quot;).
<br>
The subject briefly makes him forget his self-denying ordinance: &quot;I can't bear
<br>
the religious labelling of children,&quot; he says. &quot;Like four-year-old Islamic
<br>
children or four-year-old Catholic children... If anything makes me see red,
<br>
that does, because these children are too young to know what they are... Would
<br>
you ever talk about a four-year-old neo-Keynesian monetarist? Or a
<br>
four-year-old Gramscian Marxist? Of course you wouldn't. Religion is the one
<br>
place where opinions about society, about philosophy, about cosmology are
<br>
grafted on to labels tied round the necks of children.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dawkins' own label would have read &quot;four-year-old Anglican&quot;. His father read
<br>
Botany at Oxford, and both parents were interested in the natural sciences, so
<br>
many of the answers to his own youthful questions were likely to have been
<br>
couched in scientific rather than mythical terms.
<br>
<p>&quot;I think I can remember at the age of six regaling my unfortunate younger
<br>
sister, was three, telling her about the solar system and telling her which
<br>
planet was further away than which, and the order in which they came... I must
<br>
have got that from somewhere...
<br>
<p>&quot;The first time I understood Darwinism was when my father explained it to
<br>
me... I understood it but I didn't believe it... it didn't seem to me to be
<br>
strong enough.&quot;
<br>
<p>Educated at Oundle, he was confirmed into the Church of England after a brief
<br>
lapse in faith. He then drifted from the church again as he read more on
<br>
evolution: &quot;The second time, it was the collapse of the argument from design
<br>
and the realisation that the beauty and complexity of the living world had a
<br>
simple explanation. That was a very beautiful revelation&quot;.
<br>
<p>He revises this word &quot;revelation&quot; later – anxious, I think, that this
<br>
shouldn't sound too much like a Damascene conversion – but the sense that he
<br>
had found a credo rather than lost one remains strong. He was never, he says,
<br>
the kind of biologist who turns their hobby into an academic discipline: &quot;Many
<br>
students come into biology because they've been bird-watchers or bug-hunters –
<br>
I was always interested in the more philosophical aspects&quot;.
<br>
<p>His confidence in evolution as an all-encompassing explanatory framework also
<br>
allows for doubt: &quot;I've sometimes thought about this. Would I be discomfited
<br>
if, say, Darwinism turned out to be wrong and the truth about the guiding
<br>
force of evolution, why things are so beautiful and so – apparently –
<br>
well-designed, turned out to be something else?&quot; He pauses briefly and then
<br>
his eyes widen at the thought. &quot;I would be fascinated... Obviously, I can't
<br>
imagine what that alternative might be, and I'm very sure there isn't one...
<br>
but I would be totally fascinated if there was one.&quot;
<br>
<p>The genuine excitement that this speculation arouses marks the difference
<br>
between a religious and a scientific mindset – this is a man exhilarated at
<br>
the thought of his conceptual universe being turned upside-down.
<br>
<p>In the meantime, though, he continues to fight the good fight against the
<br>
enemies of reason – the charlatans and the misguided. He did not know John
<br>
Diamond well, he points out in his preface to Snake Oil..., but he clearly
<br>
recognised a fellow- combatant, and he salutes him in martial terms. &quot;Although
<br>
this gallant man is silenced,&quot; he concludes, &quot;his guns are not silenced...
<br>
Open fire, and don't stop.&quot;
<br>
<p>It may well be that Richard Dawkins is observing a temporary ceasefire on the
<br>
religious front, but the swords haven't yet been beaten into ploughshares.
