<em>&gt; Well, its hard to imagine ourselves as a continuous, rational and emotional 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artifact; that would stay sane for millions or billions of years. At least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is the way it seems from today's vantage. However, there certainly seem 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be alternatives to constantly being awake throughout astronomical or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cosmological time.
</em><br>
<p>Immortality, or at least vastly extended lifespan, seems to necessiate
<br>
personal change and growth if you want to avoid various less-than-optimal
<br>
states. Even a slow rate of personal change over a long time will lead to
<br>
future selves that are extremely different from your current self.
<br>
<p>Some people take this as an argument that immortalism is pointless - you
<br>
will die eventually, it will just be that it is by a process of changing
<br>
into a stranger rather than actual dissolution. I disagree, although this
<br>
is of course again an example of how different conceptions of selfhood and
<br>
individuality will lead to different consequences. I view myself as a
<br>
pattern perpetuating itself forward through time, a human process striving
<br>
for various goals and values. That this process will evolve into something
<br>
unlike its past is not strange or unwelcome, rather the opposite - I was
<br>
once something very different from that I am now, and this will continue to
<br>
hold. That I am changing doesn't mean that every important aspect of me
<br>
must eventually be reversed or changed into something I might not value
<br>
today. It is possible to retain one's identity and yet become something
<br>
different.

<p><em>&gt; 5. Dyson View: Things will get less energetic, so your thoughts will get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slower and  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     slower throughout cosmological time. You won't notice this, because all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     will have the slows also. Sig Transit Gloria Cosmos.
</em><br>
<p>But notice that in his scheme, everybody gets to experience a potentially
<br>
infinite subjective lifespan. The outside universe quickly fades, but in
<br>
the virtual Olympus the party goes on forever. Pass the ambrosia, please. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Point: Its probably a smart idea to consult with a neuroscientist regarding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what biological processes induce feelings of satiation and/or boredom.  If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have a bio-body that doesn't get bored (satisfied?) or you become an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploaded computer program, in a Uber-net, would you experience satiation, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boredom? If the answer is no, would we humans seek to pursue this focus? Do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we have alternatives to the Big Sleep versus some kind of Obsessive Program 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Artifact (OPA)? Should we be de-fragged? 
</em><br>
<p>Regular defragmentation of your mind is always recommended, although some
<br>
newer models claim they do not need it. 
<br>
<p>Boredom is adaptive: without it you would end up in infinite loops too
<br>
often. So what we need is either the ability to regulate boredom, or even
<br>
better to deliberately make sure we fill our lives with rewarding,
<br>
interesting and challenging experiences. It is more an issue of mindset
<br>
than boredom/no boredom. 
<br>
<p>I have realised that I have a fairly low threshold to boredom, but I am
<br>
never bored because I have so much wonderful things to do (right now a
<br>
tempting book lies beside the computer, I know I could program that neat
<br>
program I want to write, I have several papers to read in other windows, I
<br>
could go out for some sushi and I have a big worldbuilding project I could
<br>
think of - wow! Pure ecstacy! :-) Instead we have to handle the frustration
<br>
of infinite choices, but that is much nicer. I think I can spend a few
<br>
billion years with that.
