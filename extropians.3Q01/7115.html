Melani McAlister, assistant prof of american studies at George Mason
<br>
University writes:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Writing in the _National Review_ this week (Sept. 13),
<br>
conservative columnist Ann Coulter called for the United States to just
<br>
start bombing, and not to worry too much about who the actual terrorists
<br>
are. &quot;Those responsible include anyone anywhere in the world who smiled
<br>
in response&quot; to the attacks, she wrote.  &quot;We should invade their
<br>
countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We
<br>
weren't punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top
<br>
officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That's
<br>
war.  And this is war.&quot;  Coulter is a terrifying human being, but she is
<br>
not alone.  And she is right about the nature of war, which is precisely
<br>
what must stop us from supporting it.&quot;
<br>
end quote....
<br>
<p>First off: I doubt that there are many people in the western world who
<br>
would claim that WWII was not a just war.
<br>
<p>Secondly, to those who claim we were fighting to 'save the jews', or
<br>
because of Nazi anti-semitism: No, we were not fighting for that reason.
<br>
Unfortunately, at the time, persecution of jews was not very high on the
<br>
list of anyone here in the US or Britain of why we disliked the Nazis.
<br>
It became a celebrated raison d'etre after the fact as the truth about
<br>
the concentration camps came to light as we occupied and liberated
<br>
europe, but it was not a big deal when we jumped in.
<br>
<p>Nor did the Nazis attack us like Japan did, yet we put off using our
<br>
full force against Japan until after we had helped Britain and the USSR
<br>
get finished with Germany. That strategy would be like if we found out
<br>
that bin Laden and the Taliban was responsible, we decide to go off and
<br>
take care of his buddies in Iraq, and possibly Palestine, before we
<br>
dealt with him. Then, after we got rid of all these baddies, we'd
<br>
justify it all in rewriting Islam to &quot;Make Islam Safe for Women&quot;, or
<br>
some such thing.
<br>
<p>Sounds like a wierd strategy, huh? On further thought, this isn't such a
<br>
bad idea: Kicking Iraqs butt again would be good practice, and get the
<br>
war machine mobilized for the long haul. Once the easy target is out of
<br>
the way, go on to Afghanistan, allying with the Northern Alliance
<br>
against the Taliban, and weeding the innocent Afghanis from the Taliban
<br>
wackos. The experience in Iraq would help harden the troops for the
<br>
difficulties that are sure to result in chasing the Taliban through the
<br>
mountains of Afghanistan. Without it, I doubt that the soft and coddled,
<br>
politically correct troops of today's US military could hack it.
