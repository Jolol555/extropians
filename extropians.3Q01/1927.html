<em>&gt; &gt; Aargh. Lee, Lee, do you really think there's no motivational distinction

<em>&gt; Sorry.  Logical error on my part.  I should have remembered that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinction, and that you were probably talking about something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smaller than I was thinking about (a pittance, it turns out).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Um, now does the typical lottery winner here get 10 million bucks?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The ones that I remember reading about usually have to settle for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a life-time guarantee of $100,000 a year or something.  By the way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting $1000 a year is approximately equivalent to the interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earned on $20,000 (if there aren't any taxes).  Since we're just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking ideas, do you have an idea of the value of the GI, say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in America, that you are talking about?
</em><br>
<p>Lotteries in the US can generally be won by two types of ticket holders:
<br>
those that have chosen the 'annuity' option when they bought their
<br>
ticket, or those that chose the 'cash' option. Choosing 'cash' gets you
<br>
the full value of the prize (minus 39% income taxes, unless you do a
<br>
quick filing as a limited partnership, so you only pay a 24% capital
<br>
gains tax.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll go on record as guessing that if we switched over tomorrow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a GI of $10,000, without loss of other government benefits,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of people (who have had a rough day, or who hate their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boss, or who are daunted at preparing their resume) would find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a way to live on it, and that we'd have, say, about a third of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the workforce quitting within five years.  Sound too pessimistic?
</em><br>
<p>Yes. With a GI of $10,000, its enough to live in a crappy little studio
<br>
apartment, no kids, no pets, and no fun. You'd have the dumb people
<br>
going to work to earn a better living, and the smarter and less
<br>
scrupulous ones would make a better living ripping off the dummies at
<br>
gunpoint/knifepoint (yeah, sure, go ban the guns too, just by making
<br>
them unaffordable to anybody living off of their GI.... talk about
<br>
instituting feudalism all over again)....
