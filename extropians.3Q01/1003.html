<p>
As a note to new list members, a couple years ago, I created the
<br>
exi-freedom email list at eGroups (now yahoogroups) for people who want
<br>
to freely discuss ANY freedom enhancing technology, past, present, or
<br>
future. 
<br>
<p>This was in response to a call by Greg Burch to have a one month
<br>
moratorium on posts containing any discussion involving the dreaded and
<br>
scary word 'gun', primarily because one Joe Dees was adamant about
<br>
spamming anyone who participated in such discussions with his venomous,
<br>
hate filled attacks on the posters' manhood, sexuality, sanity,
<br>
intelligence, and loyalty, etc., in an attempt to drive this subject
<br>
forever off the list of acceptable topics for the extropians list (I
<br>
shall note, for the record, for those who are aware of the politics,
<br>
that Joe's full last name is 'Dees-Thomases', and leave it at that).
<br>
Joe's posts in this guerrilla campaign ran up into the many hundreds of
<br>
posts, which resulted in Greg kicking him and several other violators of
<br>
the moratorium off the list for a month.
<br>
<p>Within a month, about 40 extropians had joined the exi-freedom list, and
<br>
a large number were rather ticked off at how such an obviously
<br>
freedom-enhancing, and therefore extropian, technology like guns could
<br>
be chased off the extropians list. A number wanted to quit the
<br>
extropians list altogether and just do all extropians discussions on the
<br>
exi-freedom list. I discouraged this, because I didn't think that
<br>
rewarding the behavior of collectivists and demagogues in debasing a
<br>
good list was something I wanted to encourage.
<br>
<p>For the record, gun topics have not been permanently banned outright
<br>
from the extropians list. Max More and Greg Burch asked me, and I
<br>
agreed, to encourage such discussions as they arise to move to the
<br>
exi-freedom list, but there is not, nor has there been since that
<br>
moratorium ended, a formal ban. This gentlemans agreement between
<br>
myself, Greg, and Max has somehow transmorgrified in Joe Dees-Thomases'
<br>
mind into the idea that there is a total ban. Joe also thinks that I was
<br>
kicked off the list when I was not, but he hasn't reiterated that
<br>
particular lie yet in this most recent discussion.
<br>
<p>I have also repeatedly invited Mr. Dees to join and participate in gun
<br>
discussions, since he seems so enamored of spouting HCI Party Line in,
<br>
on the Exi-Freedom list. My only caveat to this invitation was that he
<br>
had to tell the truth. He has yet to take me up on that invitation.
<br>
<p>So that is the story of this subject. For those new list members who
<br>
would like to discuss gun related issues, you can go to the following
<br>
link:
<br>
<p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/exi-freedom">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/exi-freedom</a>
<br>
<p>and sign up there to recieve it by message, by daily post, or by
<br>
browsing messages on the website. Membership is currently 53 members,
<br>
and it is moderated by myself, Lee Crocker, Brian Williams, and James
<br>
Rogers, but posting is currently free for members. List traffic is
<br>
currently ranging between 20-140 high quality messages a month, so its a
<br>
decent low traffic list to belong to.  We've also got a list of good
<br>
freedom website links on the links page, and some articles in the files
<br>
area, including a few written by myself, one of which has been published
<br>
in L Neil Smith's Libertarian Enterprise.
<br>
<p>All are welcome, respect is the word.
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey
