Spike et al,
<br>
<p>Similar problem here.  Don't want to go public and
<br>
tell potential psychokillers.  Want to tell the fbi,
<br>
but don't want to be on their list of &quot;friends&quot; or any
<br>
other list they might be keeping.  I like my
<br>
anonymity/privacy/invisibility.  I value the freedom
<br>
to show up only on the radar of my choice.  
<br>
<p>The homeland defense people need to address US
<br>
vulnerabilities.  To do so, they need to know about
<br>
them.  Only the sum of the people possess the
<br>
requisite comprehensive knowledge.  There needs to be
<br>
a mechanism in place to encourage people to offer up
<br>
this knowledge, and to otherwise participate
<br>
efficiently and enthusiastically in their defense.  
<br>
<p>My bias, strongly reinforced emotionally, sees the
<br>
cops, fbi, cia, etc as arrogant, politically
<br>
prejudiced, elitist, authoritarian, and contemptuous
<br>
of the &quot;ordinary citizen&quot;, whom they look down upon
<br>
and refer to smugly as &quot;civilians&quot;.  Dampens *my*
<br>
enthusiasm, but that's just me and my Vietnam-era
<br>
attitude.  
<br>
<p>Who is a better person to tell?  Your congressperson? 
<br>
It feels safer, but face it, they'll &quot;rat you out&quot; in
<br>
a minute when the fbi asks for the source of the info.
<br>
<p>Bill Wattenburg? I was impressed by his website at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.pushback.com/">http://www.pushback.com/</a>
<br>
<p>Perhaps the time has come for John Walsh to expand his
<br>
tv presence.  With &quot;America's Most Wanted&quot;, he forced
<br>
the cops to swallow their smug superiority and accept
<br>
the help of ordinary citizens.  Now, perhaps we'll see
<br>
&quot;The World's Most Wanted!&quot; I'm not a hundred percent
<br>
thrilled by this approach, but I like the
<br>
libertarian/citizen empowerment quality.
<br>
<p>The fire department?  I like this one.  I have always
<br>
felt an abundant admiration, respect, and gratitude
<br>
for these guys.  They actually DO risk their lives (a
<br>
fact recently proven so tragically and emphatically),
<br>
actually DO save the lives of others, and never say
<br>
&quot;Freeze! Nigger&quot; and then fire a warning shot through
<br>
the head.
<br>
<p>Nuff said.  I'm handing this one off to youse guys
<br>
now.
