<em>&gt; It is *no* illusion.  Our brains are already in great control of our

<p>To me this seems ill formed.  If you were to say you wished greater 
<br>
integrity (wholeness), then that would be desireable, but consider the 
<br>
possibility that the the conscious desire to &quot;achieve ever greater 
<br>
control&quot; would be perceived as an adversarial stance by the parts of the 
<br>
mind that had been excluded from that coalition.  Certainly, were I a 
<br>
part of your mind, and not a part of your consciousness, I would tend to 
<br>
see you as standing in an adversarial role with respect to me.  I have 
<br>
trouble trying to model it in any other way.  Openness, wholeness, 
<br>
receptivity ... self-honesty (I don't promise myself that I will attempt 
<br>
to be honest to anyone else, but that I will always attempt to be honest 
<br>
with myself.  And I say attempt, in the knowledge that I will 
<br>
occasionally fail, even with myself.)
<br>
<p>To me it seems that the first quest should be to understand oneself.  If 
<br>
you understand, then perhaps there can be an agreement as to what is 
<br>
desireable.  (Note:  much of the mind is non-verbal, so don't read this 
<br>
too literally.)
<br>
<p>Much of the &quot;New Age&quot; movement was about techniques.  Most of the 
<br>
theories were ... insufficient.  Well, the techniques were insufficient, 
<br>
too, but lots better than nothing.  You might look into Neuro-Linguistic 
<br>
Programming.  Bandler and Grinder had a long series of books out 
<br>
detailing many useful techniques for contacting the mind in a 
<br>
non-adversarial way.  Not sufficient, but certainly better than fighting 
<br>
with yourself.
