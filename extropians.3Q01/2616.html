<em>&gt;From a letter to the editor published by Dr. Dobbs' Journal, March 2000:
</em><br>
<p>==
<br>
The True Name of the Singularity
<br>
<p>Dear DDJ,
<br>
<p>In the December 1999 issue, Swaine defines the Singularity as referring
<br>
to the rushing pace of change, the asymptotic graphs of processing power
<br>
and such, and the resulting &quot;massive failure in the art of predicting
<br>
the future&quot;.  That's not the historical meaning of the Singularity,
<br>
although nowadays it's often used that way.  There's a fascinating story
<br>
about how &quot;singularity&quot; started by describing a mathematical function
<br>
going to infinity, then the center of a black hole, then a breakdown in
<br>
our ability to understand the future, and then infinities again.
<br>
<p>The first usage of the term &quot;Singularity&quot; in the domain of futurism was
<br>
by Vernor Vinge, referring to the difficulty of understanding a future
<br>
which contains beings more intelligent than the author.  &quot;Here I had
<br>
tried a straightforward extrapolation of technology, and found myself
<br>
precipitated over an abyss.  It's a problem we face every time we
<br>
consider the creation of intelligences greater than our own.  When this
<br>
happens, human history will have reached a kind of singularity - a place
<br>
where extrapolation breaks down and new models must be applied - and the
<br>
world will pass beyond our understanding.&quot;  (True Names and Other
<br>
Dangers, p. 47.)  The analogy was to the singularity at the center of a
<br>
black hole, where our models of the laws of physics break down; in turn,
<br>
the center of a black hole is called a &quot;singularity&quot; because of the
<br>
asymptotically infinite gravitational forces, producing a discontinuity
<br>
in the curvature of space.
<br>
<p>Once Vernor Vinge invented the term, others tried to calculate the
<br>
advent of the Singularity.  The most famous projection matched Moore's
<br>
Law to an estimate of the raw processing power required by human
<br>
intelligence, coming up with an estimate of 2035 (now obsolete, on both
<br>
counts).  Other famous graphs included the time when materials science
<br>
would reach the level of individual atoms, alleged to be in 2040 (yeah,
<br>
right!  Have you read the news lately?), and the time when human
<br>
lifespan would be projected to increase at the rate of more than one
<br>
year per year.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, others were asking what would happen after the Singularity. 
<br>
As Vernor Vinge's Hugo-winner &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot; shows in the
<br>
opening pages, intelligence-enhanced minds are more effective at
<br>
enhancing intelligence.  Some, including myself, half-seriously
<br>
speculated that the function goes to infinity.  Consider:  If computing
<br>
speeds double every two years, what happens when computer-based AIs are
<br>
doing the research?  Two years... one year... six months... three
<br>
months...
<br>
<p>The graph-projection and post-Singularity-infinity concepts then sort of
<br>
heterodyned, to form the concept of those futuristic graphs which happen
<br>
to go to infinity on any grounds whatsoever.  World population is
<br>
hyperbolic to a much better fit than exponential, going to infinity in
<br>
2029.  This has nothing to do with intelligence enhancement, but, being
<br>
a mathematical singularity, a futuristic graph projection, a
<br>
discontinuity, and an infinity, it was easily confused with the Vingean
<br>
Singularity.  And thus it all came full circle.  But what &quot;Singularity&quot;
<br>
really means is the rise of greater-than-human intelligence, and the
<br>
breakdown of our predictions as a result.
