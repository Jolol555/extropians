<em>&gt; &gt; What do you mean by &quot;contravene&quot;?  He simply wrote papers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; produced a program to back up his papers on how broken the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; protection schemes are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, it is not quite so simple.  Dmitry Sklyarov works for a Russian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; company called ElcomSoft Co. Ltd. of Moscow &lt;<a href="http://ElcomSoft.com">http://ElcomSoft.com</a>&gt;.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They sell commercial software that recovers passwords or breaks encryption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://ElcomSoft.com/prs.html">http://ElcomSoft.com/prs.html</a>&gt;.  Their software is purportedly intended for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who have lost their passwords, but could be used by anybody to break
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into for which they never had a password.  They sell programs that can crack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into just about anything:  Compressed files, Microsoft Office products, AOL,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ICQ, Quicken, QuickBooks, Lotus products, Adobe products, Borland/Corel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products, Symantec products, etc.  They also sell password generators,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brute-force password crackers, and other tools that hackers often use to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; break into other people's files.  Their site is written in English and gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all prices in U.S. dollars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Pardon me, but this has nothing to do with the charges against
<br>
him.  Many of those pasword cracking products are bought  by
<br>
&quot;law enforcement&quot; organizations like the self-same FBI that
<br>
nabbed him and refuses to release him even after Adobe dropped
<br>
their complaint and asked that he be released.  
<br>
<p>If we have a beef with the company he works for in general then
<br>
we should take that up with the company instead of locking away
<br>
one of its employees on trumped up charges.  
<br>
<p>Lastly, do not call people who do cyber breaking and enterning
<br>
&quot;hackers&quot;.  
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Their latest product is this program which breaks the encryption for Adobe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Systems Inc. PDF (Portable Document Format) files and e-books 
</em><br>
<p>This &quot;encryption&quot; is so asinine and childish that a 12 year old
<br>
could break it without hardly trying.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;without having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the decryption key.  This cracking program was not just written as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exercise or as a demo.  It was published as commercial software and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offered for sale over the Internet &lt;<a href="http://elcomsoft.com/apdfpr.html">http://elcomsoft.com/apdfpr.html</a>&gt;.  They
</em><br>
<p>It is also offered in conformance with &quot;fair use&quot; which Adobe
<br>
e-books and other closed systems today would deny by enforcing a
<br>
different set of common law in the code itself which everyone is
<br>
then forbiddent to reverse-engineer or contravene.  This is a
<br>
huge threat to all of us.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; even have a free demo version of the program available for download that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will let people crack any Adobe e-book for 30 days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Good for them!
