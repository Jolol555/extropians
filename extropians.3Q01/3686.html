<p><em>&gt; Why does society consider a person who can memorize words and

</em><br>
<p>Society considers such a person to be more intelligent, because
<br>
the I.Q. is easy to measure, and is extremely useful when applied
<br>
to large groups of people.  (We all know how useless it sometimes
<br>
is when assessing a single individual's capabilities.)

<p><em>&gt; I think most people would agree with you, Natasha, that common sense is as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important as IQ. The two kinds of intelligence aren't mutually exclusive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though. I haven't followed the discussion about Mensa on Cryonet, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people I met at the Mensa dinner meetings seemed quite ordinary; some seemed
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; gathering of people.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but it is not just a question of common sense versus I.Q.  I have known
<br>
a number of people with extremely high I.Q.s  who also were extraordinarily
<br>
gifted in common sense, yet their opinions on or judgments about any complex,
<br>
interesting question were utterly worthless, about what you'd get from some
<br>
junior high-school nerd.
<br>
<p>Natasha:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we dig deeper into each person, regardless of IQ, we will find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something of interest.
</em><br>
<p>That is very true!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am very interested in understanding why *any* highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking-skilled person is able to understand the formula
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for being healthy but not practice it.
</em><br>
<p>I have known people who smoked yet who were well-acquainted with
<br>
the health risks, as just one example.  Partly emotionally, these
<br>
people are making unconscious calculations that they will gain
<br>
more from the immediate rewards of smoking, or of not exercising,
<br>
or of eating junk foods, than they will from life-extension techniques.
<br>
<p>It is by no means clear that they are being irrational.  Our lives
<br>
are full of value choices, conscious and unconscious, and it is
<br>
most frequently the case that when someone tells someone else what
<br>
is or is not good for them, the first person doesn't really know
<br>
what life is like---or life is about---for the second person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wonder at my own ability to understand complex ideas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not be able to augment them into my life.  It may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be laziness or preoccupation with something else.
</em><br>
<p>It's neither.  Other agents of yours have other agendas (in
<br>
the sense of Minsky's Society of Mind).  On occasion, those
<br>
other agents know what they are doing.  After you are
<br>
uploaded, you may be able to reconcile.
