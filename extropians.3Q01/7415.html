<p>Like anyone here cares of late, but the opinion of this Europhile regarding 
<br>
Bush's speech is WORRIED.  It may be a &quot;golden&quot; moment in history, but I 
<br>
doubt it'll be for the better.  His words were much more ominous than 
<br>
reassuring for someone &quot;on the outside&quot; ie. Europe.
<br>
<p>Plus, this talk of &quot;exporting our values&quot; is highly dubious.  What values 
<br>
in particular?  Respect for the flag?  Be a real patriot and &quot;serve your 
<br>
country&quot;?  Pray to your God?  Don't use bad language?  And if we don't find 
<br>
these particular &quot;values&quot; to our taste?
<br>
<p>Have you any idea how many times I've heard &quot;god&quot; in the last two 
<br>
weeks?  Everything from blessing the tragicallly lost to the &quot;righteous&quot; 
<br>
war to come.

<em>&gt;Last night, an unmistakable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;line was drawn between things that are good and right and things that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evil. Although it was done in a distinctly American way in a distinctly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;American voice, the call went out to the world to make a clear-cut choice
</em><br>
<p>Oh really?  Between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;, so sayeth the U.S. of A.?  And if 
<br>
we, in our democratic right, decide not to choose?  What then?
<br>
<p>I'll be taking a break from posting for the next week or so.  The 
<br>
Nationalistic stench around here has been a little too strong for my taste.
<br>
<p>Shaun, I wish you the best of luck in your quest for citizenship.
<br>
<p>I'm ashamed to say it, but I really thought I knew this list better than to 
<br>
fall into the jingoism trap.
<br>
<p>What a damn waste.

<p><p><p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and

crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures

to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
