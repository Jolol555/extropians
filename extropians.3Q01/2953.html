</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [None of which much helps a discussion of how to set up a libertarian

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many of Modesitt's postulated future societies revolve around point b) [but

</em><br>
<em>&gt; society and rigid control of the technologies that would allow any one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person to go out any wreck things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure you have a complete grasp of the Sysop Scenario. It is not
<br>
about &quot;forcing&quot; anything at all. No one is forced to modify their mind,
<br>
or live a libertarian life. The whole point is everyone is free to do
<br>
what they want, live the way they want, etc. It is volition-based. It
<br>
is about protecting what you want and how you want to live.
<br>
<p>I would not call it a libertarian or any other society. Some people may
<br>
form governments or societies inside of it, others may not participate at
<br>
all and focus on individual pursuits. Yet they all can still interact with
<br>
other without any possibility of stepping on each others toes (unless they
<br>
want their toes stepped on).
<br>
<p>I have yet to see a better solution to the issue. At some point the matter
<br>
(as in atoms) must fall under someone's control, and personally I don't
<br>
relish the idea of having to constantly protect myself from everyone else
<br>
who can't be trusted with nanotech and AI. All it takes is one Blight to
<br>
wipe us out. That kind of threat does not go away as humans progress to
<br>
transhumanity, rather it increases in likelihood. What is the stable state
<br>
if not Sysop or total death? There may be some other possibilities, can
<br>
you name some?
