Regulate Secret World Of cloning
<br>
Source: Seattle Post - Intelligencer
<br>
Publication date: 2001-08-17

Arrival time: 2001-08-18
<br>
<p>To spend time listening to Dr. Panayiotis Zavos, who has vowed to
<br>
clone a human being by 2003 no matter what, is to be convinced that
<br>
Frankenstein not only lives but is now running the lab.
<br>
Zavos, who is one of those medical researchers who has become an
<br>
international media star in recent weeks, gave state legislators from
<br>
all over the country a frightening lecture on molecular biology
<br>
earlier this week at a national conference in San Antonio.
<br>
<p>Among other things, Zavos dismissed America's fears about where
<br>
biological science is taking the human species as &quot;illogical&quot; and said
<br>
government bans on cloning won't work because scientists like him are
<br>
going to do it anyway.
<br>
<p>&quot;If you ban it, this technology will go into clandestine
<br>
laboratories,&quot; Zavos said, in what sounded like both a threat and a
<br>
promise. He and Dr. Severino Antinori of the University of Rome are
<br>
working to clone human embryos at a secret location outside the United
<br>
States.
<br>
<p>The question is: Why?
<br>
<p>The answer might not be very logical, but it is messily human.
<br>
Scientists such as Zavos are not immune to all the usual temptations
<br>
of mortal beings. He wants to be rich. He wants to be famous. And he
<br>
wants to be first.
<br>
<p>As Zavos told the legislators, &quot;This may be a dirty business, but
<br>
someone has to do it.&quot;
<br>
<p>If this man is the father of cloning - and that in fact is what he and
<br>
a handful of others claim to be - then the politicians are hopelessly
<br>
outmatched.
<br>
<p>Nothing could be more useless than the bill the House of
<br>
Representatives passed 265-to-162 to ban all human cloning in the
<br>
United States. It's way too late for outright bans.
<br>
<p>In fact, the ban that the Reagan administration placed on federal
<br>
funding for embryo research in 1981 has had the effect of pushing all
<br>
of this research into the private sector, where people like Zavos have
<br>
worked in the dark with no oversight or regulation at all.
<br>
<p>Now we have a situation where even relatively harmless drugs receive
<br>
at least cursory review from the Food and Drug Administration, but
<br>
privately funded researchers continue to pursue the idea in their
<br>
laboratories that we can - and should - genetically design our own
<br>
children.
<br>
<p>Like it or not, exceeding the limits of biology is to the 21st century
<br>
what pushing the limits of physics was to the 20th century.
<br>
<p>The only way to cope with all this is to embrace the positive effects
<br>
- using embryos to overcome infertility as well as to coax cures for
<br>
Alzheimer's and diabetes - and to criminalize such acts of despotism
<br>
as &quot;reproductive cloning,&quot; which is growing copies of people.
<br>
<p>In other words, rather than thinking in terms of outlawing this
<br>
brave-new-world research vs. not outlawing it, we need to acknowledge
<br>
that the future we feared is already here, and coping with it is going
<br>
to take more bravery than any of us imagined.
<br>
<p>The last thing we need is for biomedical researchers such as Zavos to
<br>
operate in secret and in other countries, without criteria or
<br>
regulations.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, the only way to do that is for the federal government
<br>
to fund the research and to fund it at levels substantially higher
<br>
than President Bush proposed last week when he proposed that we limit
<br>
federally funded research to the 60 stem-cell lines in existence.
<br>
<p>The public sector can't afford to let the private sector lead in this
<br>
debate. The stakes are too high for all of us.
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm not the kind of man who fails,&quot; Zavos told legislators.
<br>
<p>One of the legislators asked Zavos if he thought that scientists could
<br>
clone Thomas Jefferson. Not only Jefferson, answered Zavos, but Adolf
<br>
Hitler as well, which is why none of us can allow ourselves to remain
<br>
in the dark on this issue.
<br>
<p>Whatever happens in the lab needs to happen in the open.
