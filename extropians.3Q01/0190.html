<p><em>&gt;&gt; 250 billion is the lowball figure just to rewire the U.S. with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fiber.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Say, that's a lot of fiber. Given that modern fiber can carry few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;TBps, and hollow core fiber even more, what are you going to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the bandwidth? What's wrong with LoS and wireless for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last mile?
</em><br>
<p>That's to put fiber to every home/business, (last mile) if you're
<br>
going to do it right....
<br>
<p>Fiber bandwidth just plain blows away any wireless system I've
<br>
seen, and in fact if you look at the numbers it's cheaper to
<br>
install fiber than it is to try to build a wireless system at high
<br>
data rates for that many users.
<br>
<p>Besides wireless doesn't scale very well, and no one wants to wire
<br>
low traffic (profit) areas.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You want worldwide Universal wireless connectivity? For how many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people? The whole world?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Ahem, we already have that. It's just a tad too expensive for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;general use.
</em><br>
<p>I was just very surprised to learn that Iridium is still around,
<br>
but at 2.4Kbps dialup and 10Kbps max and those expensive per
<br>
minute/packet rates just how useful is it. Besides how many users
<br>
can it support simultaneously? I think the answer is too few to
<br>
mention. And it cost how many billions?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Lets see there are about 6.2 billion people in the world, if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; could do this for $1000 a port (we can't get even close to that)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you're talking 6.2 trillion dollars. The real figure to build 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; such a system is probably considerably more.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;How much connectivity do you need? Few kbps from any point of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world for anyone who can fork over a few $100 for the wireless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;receiver should be doable right now for two figure gigabucks. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the user base would scale, it would be even cheap.
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't scale, and it's not upgradable, it supports a limited
<br>
number of users, and it's nowhere near cheap.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Of course if we're talking about a system for a few thousand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rich techies, it would be less.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;While we're talking about a few k rich techies, Iridium is selling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;data transfer services.
</em><br>
<p>For of billions of dollars invested, supporting a limited number of
<br>
users at 2.4 and 10 Kbps, and big bucks.
<br>
<p>Still it's a very valuable addition to the worldwide network, if I
<br>
was a yachtsman, I'd want one.
