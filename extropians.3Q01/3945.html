<p>I'm not sure what the original context was but I'll comment.
<br>
&quot;Before&quot; *and* now a condition of war exists between various &quot;bugs&quot;.
<br>
They developed antibiotics as assault missles.  The viruses
<br>
have been swapping the design instructions for these devices
<br>
for quite some time.  All we threw into the mixture was
<br>
a selection pressure to promote the survival of the instructions.
<br>
So their abundance has increased.
<br>
<p>I wouldn't be very worried about the fact that we have picked
<br>
off the &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot;.  With hundreds of essential genes
<br>
to potentially target there are going to be lots of opportunities
<br>
to re-invent antibiotics.  Fortunately these will likely
<br>
be produced using organic chemistry and the bacteria will not
<br>
be able to get their hands on the instructions.  Well, at least
<br>
not until the Sysop decides to uplift them....
