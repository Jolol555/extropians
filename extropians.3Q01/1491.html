<br>
<p>I would presume that NGOs are included in the ban, but can probably get 
<br>
special permission to be exempt from it.  That's what we did, when I was in 
<br>
Syria and such places with a non-profit medical group, Orbis (the charity 
<br>
with the eye hospital DC-10 aircraft.)
<br>
<p>Actually, whether the country had an internet ban in place or not, we always 
<br>
asked for permission to set up our IMARSAT satellite dish, because having a 
<br>
satellite dish on the wing of our airplane was bound to look a little 
<br>
suspicious!  On a couple of occasions permission was not granted, but 
<br>
usually it was no problem.
