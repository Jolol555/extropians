<p>
Even though I am relatively new to the list, I have to say that
<br>
I am somewhat amazed of the confussion the usage of these terms have caused.
<br>
<p>I have always thought that the definition at www.transhumanism.com is
<br>
&quot;offical&quot; and it says, as Natasha previously mentioned, that &quot;trans&quot;
<br>
in transhuman comes from &quot;in transition&quot; - phase between being human
<br>
and transhuman. As I understand this, any modifiement - now matter
<br>
how small - that works better than normal allows you to use the title.
<br>
This would then exclude contact lenses as they seldom improve one's vision beoynd normal.
<br>
Also, www.transhumanism.com defines posthuman as something improved beoynd our
<br>
abilities to imagine, to a degree where we perhaps even couldn't apply the word
<br>
&quot;human&quot; to it.
<br>
<p>But IF previous definitions aren't offical and usage of these terms isn't
<br>
clear, this discussion is very important. It is about the name of the philosophy
<br>
after all. I agree with Elizier that word transhuman has strong emotional effect so
<br>
overusage should be avoided but I think that distinction between a transhuman and
<br>
posthuman should also be clear. If the terms were understood as I mentioned,
<br>
I think both requirements would be filled - for now, that is.
<br>
<p>But then, why couldn't this definition then also include memes? If transhumanist
<br>
attitude attitude somehow helps - and if improvements were available today,
<br>
it certainly would help to take advantage of them - this attitude would
<br>
also be an improvement - a self-acquired one - making you transhuman. And also,
<br>
judging from the difficulities most people have dealing with techno-optimism,
<br>
the word &quot;beoynd human&quot; would also apply as well. :)
