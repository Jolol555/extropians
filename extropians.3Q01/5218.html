<em>&gt; If Newton had called it 'electromagnetic attraction', he would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been wrong, and somebody else would have come up with the correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory of gravity. You seem to be suffering from a very Kuhnian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delusion that physical laws are created by people.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand the attack on Kuhn.  What is it in Kuhn (presumably &quot;The 
<br>
Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;) that you connect to a &quot;delusion that 
<br>
physical laws are created by people&quot;?  My reading of Kuhn was that it takes 
<br>
time for people (even scientists) to accept a fundamental change in our 
<br>
understanding of how reality works.  I didn't think he had said that the 
<br>
world hadn't changed until the consensus had settled on the new view.
