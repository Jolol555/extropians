</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps you should consider that economics is not now and has not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been a science.  Any arguments made on an economic basis should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered to have a large degree of uncertainty in them.  (I.e.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not worthy of *belief!*), no matter how appealing they are.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I'd be willing to dismiss all economic arguments as bunks.
<br>
Economics is a social science and must be taken in that context.  However,
<br>
to throw all of it out would be akin to throwing out all physics because
<br>
there are a few bad physicists out there.
<br>
<p>I hope this isn't another attempt to avoid studying some of the works I
<br>
cite.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a more practical matter, Minarchies and Anarchies have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distressing tendency to be unstable equilibria.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure about that.  We'd have to delimit instability here.  After all,
<br>
there are degrees of it.
<br>
<p>Also, a bigger problem is that one has to remember that nonminarchist states
<br>
defines a huge class, ranging from Mike Lorrey's style of government to that
<br>
of Stalin and Fidel Castro.  It's kind of like saying New Yorkers are
<br>
unstable because they don't all stay in Manhattan.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There have been a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few small examples that remained stable until perturbed by external
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stresses,
</em><br>
<p>Which ones?
<br>
<p>I can think of the Medival Iceland and Ireland and Anglosaxon England, but
<br>
the external stress in both cases was invasion.  Invasion is really
<br>
something most societies can't survive.  To say these societies were
<br>
unstable because an invader destroyed them is akin to saying that your house
<br>
is unstable because a tank can smash it.:)
<br>
<p>Add to this, it seems more like mixed economies and socialist ones are much
<br>
more unstable.  Government grows in fits and starts in both, then sometimes
<br>
collapses or is curbed back.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I think that one needs to assume that there will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external stresses, if only of TV or Radio signals.
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  Is your idea that people living in a free society might hear about
<br>
government oppression on the radio or see it on TV, then start to emulate
<br>
it?  I bet the penetration would go the opposite way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unless one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intends to run a pre-electric community, which, in fact, all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful - for - more - than - a -couple - of - decades examples
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I can think of were.  Some of the were successful for multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generations, but they were all small, isolated groups without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex internal structures (like corporations, insurance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies, security forces, etc.)
</em><br>
<p>Whaa?  I'm not talking about starting a separatist community.  I daresay
<br>
most of the libertarians on this aren't either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think it quite possible that as technology improves it will again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become possible to create small, self-contained, communities, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the macro-life variety.  Possibly some of them will be extreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian, of one flavor or another (but this implies that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life support is totally automated).
</em><br>
<p>I don't doubt something like this might play itself out in the next several
<br>
decades.  That's kind of why I wrote
<br>
&quot;For a Free Frontier: The Case for Space Colonization&quot;
<br>
(<a href="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/SpaceCol.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/SpaceCol.html</a>), though I do think the
<br>
more free the society, the more it will be emulated because free markets and
<br>
voluntary cooperation tend to work, while central planning and coercion tend
<br>
not to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What seems feasible now is to design systems to accomplish desired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ends that don't have locally centralized controls.  It's somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting that we owe the best current example, the internet, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US Army.  (They didn't wan an invading army to be able to sieze
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control.)
</em><br>
<p>Hard to untangle all the elements in this, but it's noticeable that the
<br>
government didn't invent telephony or put the [decentralized telephone]
<br>
networks in place.  It also didn't invent the technologies on which
<br>
computers are based -- solid state transitors.  Nor did it create the
<br>
computer revolution which transformed the internet from being a toy of
<br>
academics and soldiers to being what it is today.
<br>
<p>I bet if the government guided it more, we'd still be using using line
<br>
editors and looking at monochrome screens.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's also noticable, however, and a bit sad, that as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes less regulated by the government it is increasingly siezed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by monoplistic elements.  (Cable corporations, the Bell descendant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies, etc.)
</em><br>
<p>I don't think it's so much that it's become less regulated by the
<br>
government.  In fact, the amount of regulation has gone up and there are
<br>
proposals for more regulations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Private property is definitely a priority, but it happens only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within an entire social context.  It is the social context that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defines what is private, and what is property.  This isn't a given.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that we exist within this context.  Property is a social phenomena
<br>
and some aspects of it are arbitrary, but not all.  Getting along without it
<br>
creates many more problems then it solves, as humanity should have noticed
<br>
by now, especially after the bloodiest century on record.  Real flesh and
<br>
blood people died over these issues.
<br>
<p>That said, just because there's a wider context doesn't mean we can't
<br>
abstract certain aspects for consideration -- much as in lab experiments one
<br>
tries to block out extraneous effects.  Nor should it stop us from thinking
<br>
about changes, though we should always be careful to ground all of this in
<br>
the end.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  We may be headed into an era when our very bodies are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered our private property.  Or when they are considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disposable property.  And what about your children.  Are they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property?  At what age?  These are social context questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Well, these days, legal questions.  But that's a subset of social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context.)
</em><br>
<p>This talk about the limits does not really get us much further.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
