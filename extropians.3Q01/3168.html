<p><em>&gt; I answered &quot;yes&quot; to all of those questions. Does this make me idealistic or

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mean, answering any of those questions with anything other than yes means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you believe there are some aspects of life in which people shouldn't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowed to make their own decisions; shouldn't be allowed to rise or fall on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own merits. How does preventing this lead to a better society?
</em><br>
<p>Well...to choose the only one of the top part that I answered &quot;Maybe&quot;
<br>
to (the others got &quot;Yes&quot;):
<br>
<p>* People should be free to come and go across borders; to live and work
<br>
* where they choose.
<br>
<p>For the most part this is true.  But what if you live next to a
<br>
repressive government that believes in armed conquest?  A defended
<br>
border is an effective defense against such, but using this defense
<br>
means you have to impose at least a little control over who may cross
<br>
said border.  (&quot;I choose to live in your nation, and my occupations are
<br>
'enforcer for the High Holy One' and 'slayer of the infidels'.  Yes,
<br>
everyone in your nation is an infidel by definition.&quot;)
