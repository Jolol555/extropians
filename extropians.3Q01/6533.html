<em>&gt; Thanks for the interesting essay. Suppose we accept your analysis of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etiology and your prescription for the ill, namely, a new age of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enlightenment in the middle east. I am not sure how you propose to get from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;here to there&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Neither am I.
<br>
<p>However ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any thoughts and getting from here to there? 
</em><br>
<p>We should start by taking a long, hard, look at who we go to bed with.
<br>
<p>&quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot; is a seductive-sounding maxim of
<br>
realpolitik -- but horribly flawed in the real world, as Tuesday showed
<br>
us. Bin Laden was trained by the CIA: indeed, the west in general has
<br>
a hideous record for supporting bloodstained monsters in the name of
<br>
expediency.
<br>
<p>This has to stop. By supporting dictators, tyrants, and fanatics of
<br>
_any_ stripe we diminish the cause of freedom in the world -- and paint
<br>
ourselves in hypocrites' colours, and subvert our own values until it
<br>
seems almost reasonable to bring the tyranny back home.
<br>
<p>We need to stop funding political movements abroad that you wouldn't
<br>
want to see running for Congress. Stop funding governments abroad that
<br>
you wouldn't be willing to go and live under for ten years.
<br>
<p>Instead, look to your core values and give support to groups and people
<br>
who *share* them. Supporters of human rights and democracy abroad,
<br>
especially in the third world, are often critical of the US and EU
<br>
*precisely* because our governments talk the talk but don't walk the walk.
<br>
Democracy and freedom implies dissent; by their very nature democratic
<br>
movements are less likely to be uncritically grateful for your help
<br>
than a tyrant's controlled press.
<br>
<p>If we start actually behaving abroad as if we *mean* what we say when
<br>
we talk about freedom and rights, we'll gradually make friends. It'll be
<br>
a slow process; there'll be a lot of suspicion and ill-will to get over.
<br>
<p>But if you look at the German reaction to September 11th, you may find
<br>
it illuminating to ponder just what relatively enlightened policies have
<br>
achieved there over the past fifty-five years. (In case you haven't been
<br>
following it, the German government has declared itself fully behind
<br>
the Article 5 resultion passed by NATO; that's the first time since 1945
<br>
that a German government has declared itself willing and ready to send
<br>
troops abroad to fight in war. If that's not enough for you, you might
<br>
also want to take note of the national day of mourning they declared,
<br>
or the wreaths outside the US embassy. A _lot_ has changed since 1945.)
