</em><br>
<p>No.  This is an utter cannard.  It is populated by people who
<br>
see that the concept of &quot;owning&quot; software that excludes
<br>
understanding it or extending it or most uses of it by others
<br>
actually seriously devalues the software and makes us all
<br>
poorer.  The assumption that everything must be owned and
<br>
controlled is seriously quesxtioned.  This is very good news. 
<br>
<p>But OS people go out of their way to respect other's rights to
<br>
impose whatever license on software they right they wish. 
<br>
Including their right to declare that this software shall be
<br>
open in its source under conditions that as much as possible
<br>
guarantee its future openness.  
<br>
<p>The entire concept of being able to &quot;steal&quot; becomes very
<br>
questionable when what is &quot;stolen&quot; is not diminished by making
<br>
copies and distributing them.  Some day we will see the concept
<br>
of owning a software algorithm and restricting who can see it to
<br>
be as backwards as owning mathematical theorems.  
<br>
<p>Owning one's own labor and extended that to what one produces
<br>
are quite different things.  My ability to write good software
<br>
is a scarce commodity in the world today.  The actual software
<br>
produced can be copied and redistributed indefinitely.  The
<br>
former needs conventional compensation, but tying that
<br>
compensation to restricting the latter in ways that makes what I
<br>
produce less valuable is not in my or anyone else's interest.
