<p>
<em>&gt;Let me explain my understanding of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitions, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why they cannot be split apart.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Racism is a belief system that non-physical attributes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; derive from race.
</em><br>
<p>This is getting close to my definition. &quot;The belief that a race is
<br>
inherently superior or inferior based on genetics&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Prejudice is pre-judging an individual before evaluating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merits.
</em><br>
<p>I agree to this as applied to people, but I think we can leave out &quot;before
<br>
evaluating their individual merits&quot; as extra verbiage not required.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Racial Prejudice is prejudice based on an individual's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; membership in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racial group.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Discrimination is making choices between different options.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Racial Discrimination is making choices between different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; options based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; race.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>also agreed
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see how someone can racially pre-judge someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without having the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief system of racism.  I don't see how someone can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racially discriminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against someone without having the belief system of racism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These terms are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inextricably intertwined thusly:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Step 1:  Racism - holding certain beliefs about races
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Step 2:  Racial Prejudice - applying those beliefs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; step 1
</em><br>
<p>Step 2 doesn't require step 1. Like we discussed before, Jesse may not
<br>
believe that blacks cause more crime based on race (I don't either), but
<br>
still believe that blacks cause more crime because of environmental factors,
<br>
and still make decisions based on race because of this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Step 3:  Racial Discrimination - taking actions against those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals
</em><br>
<p>Taking actions &quot;against&quot; sounds a bit negative, when it could also be
<br>
applied in a positive light. i.e. Giving a race special privileges over some
<br>
&quot;Norm&quot;. I would just say taking action on some race because of their race. I
<br>
know, nitpicking again... but just trying to be clear.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; based on step 2
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I understand these terms, I don't see how someone could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discriminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without pre-judging first.  I don't see how someone could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-judge without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having pre-existing beliefs first.  I could see someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admitting that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were racist, but tried not to act on it.  I don't see how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone can claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be prejudiced or discriminatory while also claiming not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be racist.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This goes back to black cops and Jesse again. I think they are grouping
<br>
blacks together into a group based on environmental causes (same living
<br>
conditions, culture, neighborhoods?), not genetic heritage, even though the
<br>
2 are very similar. The reason to nitpick this though is because without a
<br>
clear understanding of this, a white person can not in fact point to the
<br>
same issues that Jesse and black cops point to without being labeled racist.
<br>
Without this ability, whites cant even discuss &quot;black issues&quot; without being
<br>
defined as racist &quot;by definition&quot;, even though we are intertwined with this
<br>
issues and the problems that are caused by all this friction.
<br>
<p>I do thank you for the rational discussion on this though, I have to admit
<br>
that this has been one of the more reasonable discussions I think I've ever
<br>
witnesses.
