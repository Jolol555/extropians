From: Greg Burch
<br>
&lt;&lt;You say that very few modern Arabs read the entirety of the Q'ran.  It's
<br>
actually a very slim book and of the three religions that have &quot;sacrelized the
<br>
text&quot; (a term I have developed in my own study of religious memetics), Islam
<br>
seems to be the most concrete in its apotheosis of the &quot;logos&quot; . . . so I
<br>
wonder about that.  Anyway, I mean to find out.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Here's a URL to help you in your research
<br>
<a href="http://www.luc.edu/orgs/msa/quran/005.qmt.htm#005.082">http://www.luc.edu/orgs/msa/quran/005.qmt.htm#005.082</a>
<br>
<p>Interesting excerpts:
<br>
<p>005.082
<br>
YUSUFALI: Strongest among men in enmity to the believers wilt thou find the
<br>
Jews and Pagans; and nearest among them in love to the believers wilt thou
<br>
find those who say, &quot;We are Christians&quot;: because amongst these are men devoted
<br>
to learning and men who have renounced the world, and they are not arrogant.
<br>
PICKTHAL: Thou wilt find the most vehement of mankind in hostility to those
<br>
who believe (to be) the Jews and the idolaters. And thou wilt find the nearest
<br>
of them in affection to those who believe (to be) those who say: Lo! We are
<br>
Christians. That is because there are among them priests and monks, and
<br>
because they are not proud.
<br>
SHAKIR: Certainly you will find the most violent of people in enmity for those
<br>
who believe (to be) the Jews and those who are polytheists, and you will
<br>
certainly find the nearest in friendship to those who believe (to be) those
<br>
who say: We are Christians; this is because there are priests and monks among
<br>
them and because they do not behave proudly.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
