<em>&gt; &gt; The thing that worries me is that if government is reduced to the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that many libertarians want, then they risk simply becoming lackeys of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; powerful business interests. This would simply result in the situation
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; describe above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who is 'they'? If you mean the government, powerful business interests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not able to use the government to any extent because that government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is limited in what it can do. In such a situation, a union, for example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would always overpower a corporation because the union membership will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always outnumber the corporation's lackeys, where both sides can arm or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disarm as much as they wish. The government would not be empowered to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; step in on the corporations side to force the union to settle, or impede
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the union membership from arming as they see fit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Liberals always see themselves, as individuals, as being entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerless in all possible situations, reliant on the government patron
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to protect them.
</em><br>
<p>Regarding liberals seeing themselves as &quot;powerless&quot; in all possible
<br>
situations:  Do you mean some liberals?  All liberals?  12.895% of liberals?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;This is part of the liberal victimological myth that
<br>
<em>&gt; has evolved from common serf attitudes held by immigrants coming from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feudal and tyrannical systems. They don't see that if the power of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government is reduced, not only is the ability of the corporations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduced (since their power is given to them by government protections),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the individuals regain great power as individuals, because that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the government got its power in the first place.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, but ... leaving things just to &quot;individuals&quot; didn't work out too well
<br>
in the past, did it?  What's wrong with a checks-and-balances system?
<br>
Accountability ... coalitions ... these are not irresponsible ideas, and
<br>
they can certainly be part of a governing system.  People (individuals,
<br>
after all) make up government -  it's not like it's some kind of amorphous
<br>
entity of The Bad Crimson Guy with Horns.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Under libertarianism, laborers will gain far greater power than they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realize, and corporations will finally be fully exposed to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retribution they earn by unjust actions.
</em><br>
<p>Sigh.  Got any historical precedents?  (when laborers had the &quot;power,&quot; and
<br>
corporations were very, very goooooooooood boys).
