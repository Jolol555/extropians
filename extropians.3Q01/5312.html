<em>&gt; &gt; I find that people will prefer to be treated different if that different

<em>&gt; Yes, but sometimes people will identify with a group for reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having nothing to do with personal advantage.  Sometimes people
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; encourages this identification with the group.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, quite so. Individuals who feel a need to be righteous and indignant
<br>
will generally find a group to identify with. Me, I'm equally indignant
<br>
about everything, but especially other people's blind spots.
