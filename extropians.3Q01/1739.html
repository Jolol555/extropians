</em><br>
<p>Sometimes a person can have a run of bad luck (such as being born to a poor
<br>
parent who can't take proper care of herself, let alone a child; or such as
<br>
developing a chronic illness that isn't completely covered by insurance),
<br>
and there's no one around to help. I could give a number of examples, but
<br>
it's difficult to believe you've lived such a sheltered life that you
<br>
wouldn't realize that sometimes people simply don't have enough resources.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;True, there is no absolute
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;veil of tears.
</em><br>
<p>That's right, but I like the idea of minimizing suffering where possible. I
<br>
don't consider suffering particularly beautiful or noble. I've been through
<br>
enough of it personally to know that it sucks. (I've never had any
<br>
government help, but there have been times when I would have been most
<br>
grateful for a minimum guaranteed income)
<br>
<p>IF we had only natural selection to count on for improving the species, then
<br>
I could see a reason for letting the less able people die off. But this is
<br>
not the case.
<br>
<p>Of course, the situation isn't as simple as it might sound when people sit
<br>
around talking about it. There are, for example, tragedies that result from
<br>
good hearted attempts to help, such as where food aid is given to hungry
<br>
people who then produce more children (starving people, after all, don't
<br>
produce live infants) and the end result is several times more starving
<br>
people than there were originally. I believe that a guaranteed minimum
<br>
income would require legal limits on reproduction. But theoretically, yes,
<br>
I'd like to live in a world where every person was guaranteed basic food,
<br>
shelter, and medical care.
