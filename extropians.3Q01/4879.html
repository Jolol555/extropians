<p>
When I say I'm a nominalist, I don't say so lightly. I refute the idea
<br>
there is any absolute reality, external reality, or anything of the
<br>
sort. Mark Walker is his response differentiated between moral truths
<br>
and scientific truths, that one could be a relativist in one and not the
<br>
other. Possibly, but in my opinion people who fixate tend to do so in
<br>
everything.
<br>
<p>I appreciate your idea of ethical subjectivism. This is because, in my
<br>
opinion all knowledge is choice based. We select or choose the things we
<br>
know. Knowledge does not exist in us because we stumble upon the reality
<br>
of it. At any moment in time we arbitrarily choose which things we shall
<br>
consider true, no differently than the way we choose cars or clothing.
<br>
What scientist does not make the choice to say his research supports his
<br>
hypothesis? If knowledge is wholly choice based, then knowledge is
<br>
necessarily dependent on personal valuations, and if through valuation
<br>
then it is morality which dictates knowledge and not vice versa. I
<br>
steadfastly resist the idea anyone can be moral for rational reasons, or
<br>
morality might be rationally derived. Such is simply narrow mindedness
<br>
and bigotry. But people can be rational for moral reasons. In other
<br>
words it is a choice to be rational. To be ethically subjective is
<br>
simply to say a person proceeds to live out whatever knowledge set he
<br>
has.
<br>
<p>The idea of a fixed external reality we all relate to, is not difficult
<br>
to refute. It is done by continually denoting vagueness. It is an issue
<br>
of semantics and context, only. If semantics, context, objectifications,
<br>
and identities are of the mind, then reality is of the mind and whatever
<br>
we deem it to be. Again, morality, or how choice is constructed is the
<br>
root of knowledge, and knowledge is not the root of morality, regardless
<br>
what the pompous may say, or try and dictate.
<br>
<p>Rather than a reality-based metaphysical model, I prefer a logic-based
<br>
one. Someone may wonder what the difference is. A logic-based model
<br>
means whatever I think, feel, or believe is contrived dynamically in the
<br>
moment. My view of the world is constructed as I see it at that time. In
<br>
contrast, a reality-based model involves however many fixations a person
<br>
has and for whatever reason has chosen to remain stuck on.

<em>&gt;David said
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I agree morality exists. I just do not agree it is always the same, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;must always be the same.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Unlike most on the list (as far as I can work out), I am an ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subjectivist. I think we are *ultimately* driven back to our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;commitments, values, etc. This list seems to be dominated by ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;realists and natural lawyers (I am a legal positivist), positions which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find puzzling and wildly metaphysical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In any event, you can be an ethical subjectivist without being a relativist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(most forms of relativism seem to be internally inconsistent). Would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like to elaborate any further on your views?
