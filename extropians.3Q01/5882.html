My own recommendations for young minds...
<br>
<p>&quot;The Gods Themselves&quot; by Isaac Asimov
<br>
<p>&quot;Wandering Stars : An Anthology of Jewish Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; introduction by Isaac Asimov
<br>
<p>&quot;The Golden Compass&quot; by Phillip Pullman
<br>
<p>&quot;Shade's Children&quot; by Garth Nix
<br>
<p>&quot;Sabriel&quot; by Garth Nix
<br>
<p>&quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; by Madeleine L'Engle 
<br>
<p>&quot;Johnny The Homicidal Maniac : Director's Cut&quot; by Jhonen Vasquez(maybe this title should wait....)
<br>
<p>This boy just needs to visit their local Barnes &amp; Noble to find some good sf titles.  Hey, that could be a good father and son activity!  
<br>
<p>And now for my thoughts about Eliezer's recommendations.
<br>
<p>Eliezer wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt;Dragonlance, &quot;Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Legends&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Advanced Dungeons and Dragons&quot;, various handbooks.
</em><br>
<p>So, you would recommend these, but not the Masquerade rpg books?
<br>
<p>And, of course:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;Engines of Creation&quot; by K. Eric Drexler.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;QED:  The Strange Theory of Light and Matter&quot; by &gt;Richard Feynman (this was one of my favorites when I &gt;was nine).
</em><br>
<p>Wow....  At best then I was perusing Isaac Asimov's pop science books for the masses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Collections of Martin Gardner's &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; &gt;columns.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;The Moral Animal&quot; by Robert Wright (you're *never* &gt;too young to start learning about evolutionary &gt;psychology).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, so you will understand the cruelties of the teenage mating game...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; by Douglas R. Hofstadter (ditto &gt;game theory).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;The Incredible Bread Machine&quot; by R. W. Grant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman&quot; by Richard &gt;Feynman.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;The Tao Is Silent&quot; by Raymond Smullyan.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Don't forget to LEARN A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.  Do &gt;this as early as possible while you still have the &gt;brain plasticity.  I recommend Python followed by &gt;Java followed by C++.
</em><br>
<p>I must remember this for when I successfully reproduce...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you want to learn a foreign language, you have &gt;only one year left to do it before puberty kicks in &gt;and your auditory cortex freezes over.
</em><br>
<p>I wish from &quot;genetic memory&quot; my mother had passed on her ability to speak Spanish...  Or simply taught me in the home.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Do stay away from:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Stephen R. Donaldson
</em><br>
<em>&gt;John Barnes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;David Feintuch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Vampire:  The Masquerade&quot;
</em><br>
<p>To mature for young minds?  I would think so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;All of Heinlein's *later* books (this should go &gt;without saying).  The books Anne McCaffrey wrote &gt;because they locked her up and wouldn't give her any &gt;food until she wrote more Pern novels.  
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Ditto, &gt;Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman and the &gt;sophisticated &gt;AI devices churning out upwards of &gt;sixty Dragonlance &gt;books per day.
</em><br>
<p>So, that's how they crank out so many of them!  They must have taken the technology from the romance novel genre! ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And if you read anything of David Eddings', borrow it &gt;from the library rather than buying it, or make &gt;really sure you buy it used at a quarter price, &gt;because you and all your friends will suddenly &gt;outgrow David Eddings over a two-week period.
</em><br>
<p>I have never read an Eddings novel.  A reviewer once mocked how Eddings elves sometimes used California slang. 
<br>
<p>Eliezer, did you accidently leave out, &quot;Godel, Escher, Bach : An Eternal Golden Braid,&quot; or should he wait to read it till he turns eleven? ;)
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
