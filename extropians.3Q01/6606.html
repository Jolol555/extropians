<em>&gt; &gt; I don't

<em>&gt; &gt; have to ask to know that Germany as a member of NATO will get very cold

<em>&gt; &gt; feet when we're talking about 10 dead young men.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This demonstrates a vast difference in the psychology of our two

</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
And, with all due respect, that's bollocks.
<br>
<p>Germany, in case you'd missed out on it, came out strongly behind the
<br>
Article 5 vote at NATO. That means that under the German constitution
<br>
they are not only _allowed_ but _expected_ to send soldiers abroad to
<br>
fight and die for their allies.
<br>
<p>Lest we forget why they seem to reluctant to do so, we've spent fifty-five
<br>
years telling them to be ashamed of their history of using violence as
<br>
an instrument of state policy. Germany has a collective cultural cringe
<br>
reflex over waging war abroad comparable to the white American's cringe
<br>
reflex over slavery -- if not stronger.
<br>
<p>Plus, you're inviting Germany to violate Liddell-Hart's two rules 
<br>
of warfare: &quot;never start a war on two fronts, and never start a land
<br>
war in Asia&quot;. (Two fronts? Hell, yes. Germany is 10% muslim, believe
<br>
it or not. There are seven million Turkish immigrants there, and while
<br>
most of 'em are secular, there _will_ be extremists mixed in -- 
<br>
enough to cause a domestic terrorism problem that would make Baader-
<br>
Meinhoff look like a pimple compared to gas gangrene).
<br>
<p>As for France, France isn't a member of the NATO unified command
<br>
structure.  France pulled out of it in 1967, and in 1968 the French
<br>
government ended up violently suppressing riots that were organised by
<br>
people who received funding, not to be too blunt about it, from the same
<br>
idiots who paid Bin Laden during the 1980's. They've got a grudge, guys:
<br>
you tried to overthrow their government. *Despite* which, they voted in
<br>
favour of the Article 5 motion and are quibbling not about whether to
<br>
respond, but about what _form_ such response should take.
<br>
<p>For the sake of whatever you believe in ... the President of Russia is
<br>
comparing the terrorists to Nazis (clue: this is a BIG hot-button issue
<br>
in the Russian psyche) and also discussing the form Russian aid would
<br>
take. Compare this with the situation you'd have expected fifteen years
<br>
ago, before Glasnost broke out: back then they'd have been chortling
<br>
with glee, not discussing how many troops to send you!
<br>
<p>If you think China and Iran and Russia all sound a little lukewarm and
<br>
are quibbling over the details of the military operation and advising
<br>
caution, you're overlooking the big picture: which is that just four
<br>
weeks ago, the idea of the US invading Afghanistan would have had them
<br>
denouncing you from the rooftops.
<br>
<p>There has been a _HUGE_ political sea-change in the past week, one of
<br>
epoch-making proportions.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You will get your war. There's no need asking for it extra, the people on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the street are clamoring for it loud enough. At this point every sane and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rational person should not only stop amplifying hate but try to spread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information and moderation amongst those who are willing to listen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just hope that Americans are going into this with their eyes open.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghanistan is not southern Iraq.  It's not going to be a repeat of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Gulf War.  The Afghans successfully fought off the Soviet army for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many years
</em><br>
<p>With [cough, cough ] CIA support and funding funneled through Pakistan.
<br>
<p>The boot is firmly on the other foot, this time. If Dubya was half the
<br>
diplomat his father was, we could expect a _joint_ Russian/US/Chinese/Paki
<br>
invasion force, combined with simultaneous uprisings in Taliban-held
<br>
regions. The Taliban are oppressors; play it right and the Afghanis will
<br>
be welcoming the US troops as liberators.
