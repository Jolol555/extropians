<p>Thanks for the refs, I'll have a look.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that memetic warfare can be very much a useful potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy, but I would hope extropians can come up with something better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than dropping pork rinds on muslims. While some starving Afghanis,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps especially women begging in the streets to secure food for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children, might appreciate crunchy pork snacks, the price of getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caught doing so might well be immediate execution.
</em><br>
<p>Causing the locals to hate the Towelban even more. Or confiscation of
<br>
said 3P's by the Towelban, causing the locals to hate the Towelban
<br>
even more AND tempting the holy warriors themselves. At any rate, I'm
<br>
pretty sure the US of all countries can crank out junkfood and smut
<br>
faster than they can track it all down (I bet it's cheaper than our
<br>
high-tech munitions).
<br>
<p>Methinks I'd even volunteer to pose for the Porn component of the 3Ps.
<br>
Maybe bring a smile of appreciation (or mirth, I don't care) to the
<br>
lips of their ladies and any closeted gay Towelbaners out there. I've
<br>
been working out, you know, so I've been defining them abs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here are some possible strategies:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Convert to Islam. Why not? I've been arguing anyway that a
</em><br>
...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; get Bill Gates to explain that nothing works right till version 3.0 with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Old Testament = v. 1, New = v. 2, Koran = v. 3. At least american office
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workers can appreciate that logic.  Once we get off-planet we can start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonably discussing atheist societies.
</em><br>
<p>And to use another M$ metaphor, embrace and extend. I can see it now--
<br>
new-agey, watered-down, PC, and 'inclusive'. Now THAT will get to
<br>
them big time. And once they start drawing lines between who is a real
<br>
Muslim and who isn't, it's a slippery slope from there to schism and
<br>
reformation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) Move all Israelis to New York, make NY state the new Israel, then
</em><br>
...
<br>
<p>Nah. While this proposal is as outlandish as my own, and hats off to
<br>
you on that, it is vastly more expensive and politically impossible
<br>
(as opposed to merely politically embarassing if caught in the case of
<br>
my own).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) Think a generation ahead. Offer muslim women free immigration to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US, along with young kids, but no males older than maybe 10. And of
</em><br>
<p>Maybe not de jure, but de facto might work. Something like 'if you're
<br>
not eligible for military service for reason of age or gender' or 'if
<br>
you're denied education, property, or voting rights in your home
<br>
country' Of course, it would be leaky like all systems are, and we'd
<br>
inevitably get infiltrated by thousands of moles.
<br>
<p>Perhaps if we staked out a limited territory we were capable of
<br>
defending within the theater of operations and designated it a refugee
<br>
zone open to anybody who managed to escape from Towelban-controlled
<br>
areas. Feed them, pump money into education and economic development,
<br>
and do everything possible to inspire a culture of democracy,
<br>
individual liberty, and secularism in that area.
<br>
<p>Any spooks lurking on the list? I hope to god there are! Maybe not
<br>
necesserily listening to my half-baked ideas, but at least thinking
<br>
along the lines of meme-war and economic/cultural subversion rather
<br>
than the bone-headed Vietnam tactics that appear to be holding sway in
<br>
public pronouncements.
