</em><br>
<em>&gt; Question: What would you propose?
</em><br>
<p>The most straightforward way to shift US away from oil use would probably be
<br>
to impose a major tax on oil products used as fuel. Tax to be phased in over
<br>
several years to give the economy time to adjust. Proceeds used to fund
<br>
research into other types of energy. (oil use by sector is, from highest to
<br>
lowest--industrial, transportation, commercial, residential).
<br>
<p>I would discourage wholesale building of nuclear power plants.
<br>
<p>Problem any solution that only applies to US is that this is a global
<br>
matter. It's a prisoner's dilemma sort of problem. The (temporary--until new
<br>
sources of energy could be perfected) increase in production costs that
<br>
would result from the tax would put US products at an international
<br>
disadvantage. The US dollar would decline in value. Net effect would be to
<br>
make the US even more vulnerable than it is now, since our economy depends
<br>
on foreign trade as much as on oil; and the nations we trade with depend on
<br>
oil. Since industry and transportation are the major consumers of oil, I
<br>
doubt if it would do much good to only tax home energy consumption and fuel
<br>
for personal automobiles.
<br>
<p>Any effective solution is going to have to be global. The only thing I can
<br>
think of that could cause this to happen would be a threat that's bigger
<br>
than any of us--eg. approaching asteroid on collision course with Earth;
<br>
major global epidemic (although that might have the opposite effect of
<br>
causing nations to close down borders and become more isolated); invasion of
<br>
Earth by aliens.
<br>
<p>My opinion is that we're going to have to ride this one out. Do what we can
<br>
as individuals, factoring the international oil situation into our decision
<br>
making process.
<br>
