Harvey Newstrom very constructively writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee Corbin wrote,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Good.  Then we totally agree.  All that remains is for you to explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; specifically what was in the article that you question---rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; just the web site it came from or who the author is affiliated with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please accept my sincerest apologies that I simply do not have time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research every point in this article or any of your other repeated articles.
</em><br>
<p>No apology needed.  Now if we could only buy time as easily as we buy books...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not even sure what specific points I could focus upon first to try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed this debate up.  In fact, I'm not even clear on what points you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to make with these articles.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I didn't post either of the two articles that were causing so much
<br>
heat.  In fact, I wouldn't have posted either of them; this last one, which
<br>
I guess we'll go into a little, was just a piece by conservatives for
<br>
conservatives; perhaps it was posted because of some of the accusations
<br>
against liberals that it contains.  It was posted, I believe, at a point
<br>
when some liberals on this list were being criticized on their general
<br>
beliefs by conservatives, and vice-versa (not that there is anything
<br>
wrong with that).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you trying to prove that blacks are inferior to whites, blacks have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lower IQs than whites, and blacks commit more crimes than whites?
</em><br>
<p>No.  While these might indeed be factual (on some readings of those words),
<br>
the article that we were arguing about had nothing to do with that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you trying to prove that God has not been disproved, that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was always a Christian nation, that our laws are all based on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bible, and that a specific religion is the best path to Truth?
</em><br>
<p>Likewise no, no, no, and no.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you trying to prove that conservatives have a longer history than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberals,
</em><br>
<p>That article did touch on this.  According to it, liberals (in the American
<br>
sense of someone who believes in having a large, powerful, and protective
<br>
government) try to trace their history back to Abraham Lincoln, and the
<br>
immensely larger government that arose during the civil war.  The article
<br>
contends that instead, liberalism is properly viewed as arising only with
<br>
the New Deal.  Now this is a claim that would be agreed to by many liberals;
<br>
many, in fact, see FDR and his administration as the first real &quot;progressive&quot;
<br>
government that the U.S. ever had.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or a more valid history than liberals, or more of a claim to American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history than liberals?
</em><br>
<p>Certainly not!  I wrote a personal essay under the thread &quot;Origin of Beliefs&quot;
<br>
where I explained how I was very lucky to have obtained at the age of twelve
<br>
an understanding of the symmetry of the political spectrum in a number of 
<br>
ways.  But if indeed conservatives were able to trace their history back farther,
<br>
it wouldn't mean any more than the fact that the Democratic Party has a
<br>
longer history than the Republican Party.  In fact, for most of my life, the
<br>
liberals I knew would have keenly embraced the idea that they didn't have a
<br>
long history, mainly because they felt themselves to be very modern.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you trying to prove that science is not the only or best way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth,
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for giving me a chance to explicitly deny that; I would say
<br>
that indeed &quot;science&quot; is the *only* way to objective truth.  But I 
<br>
must use the scare quotes, because I firmly believe that science
<br>
is nothing more than ordinary reasoning and common sense
<br>
methodically applied to certain areas of inquiry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and that nonscientific ways should be considered with equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authority as science?
</em><br>
<p>Right: I completely repudiate the belief by some that there are
<br>
&quot;other truths&quot; or that the way that scientists (and detectives
<br>
and surgeons, etc.) go about finding what is true and what is false
<br>
is somehow limited.  Although this might provoke a fight from 
<br>
another quarter, there aren't any different approaches to discovering
<br>
reality besides those commonly used by conventional doctors trying
<br>
help people resist sickness, or detectives trying to solve cases, or
<br>
chess masters trying to discover winning combinations, or scientists
<br>
trying to formulate more correct theories, or any number of other
<br>
instances in which human beings are carefully and skeptically
<br>
working out their understanding of reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or were all of these side-issues unrelated to some other point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you were trying to make that got lost in the clutter?
</em><br>
<p>yeah, my feathers get ruffled whenever someone is being denounced
<br>
for having said something, and yet the criticism isn't directed
<br>
towards what was said, but rather towards the person, or the general
<br>
class of people to whom the person belongs (it's a little bit like
<br>
ad hominem, IMO).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you could present your viewpoints in a more direct manner, I am sure you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would find yourself receiving more direct responses.  Try stating specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories you propose or specific questions you would ask, without going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through all of these supporting documents first.  Otherwise, I can't afford
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time to do all this research just in case you might have an idea that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be interest in supporting or refuting.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  Actually, it was you who was having the time to be quite scholarly
<br>
and research the bonafides of certain authors, who was financing them,
<br>
and the general world-view of their cronies and the websites hosting
<br>
their articles.  (Also, I should add, I never meant to demean that effort.)
<br>
<p>So I'll just reach into that article, and find the worst thing in it
<br>
that I think that you would object to.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
