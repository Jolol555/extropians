<p><em>&gt; True, I should retract the tar balls.  They can come from oil, but they also

</em><br>
<p>Wait, dont retract the tar balls.  I retract my original objection.  Natural
<br>
pollution is pollution just the same, and I define pollution as anything that
<br>
bothers humans.  If it bothers or slays animals that humans like, then that
<br>
substance is pollution too.  Humans are animals, therefor anything that
<br>
humans do is natural, therefor we need not distinguish between human
<br>
made pollution and the other variety.  Except of course we've no one
<br>
to sue with the nontechnically origin pollution.  {8-]

<p><em>&gt; &gt; Speaking of political influence, I cut out an ad in the local

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess I'm missing the problem here.  Certainly fixing leaking toilets to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stop wasting water is a good thing.
</em><br>
<p>When fresh water is being thrown into the sea from rivers, it seems
<br>
absurd for them to be worrying over a few thousand cubic
<br>
feet of fresh water a year from a bad toilet valve.  My contention
<br>
is that life is adaptable, and no ecosystem is *that* delicate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;...raise the global temperature at the same time, to

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; This seems strange, Spike.  You seem to be against fixing toilet valves to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; save water, but then you propose turning the grassy western U.S. plains into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vast forests instead.  Will you grab all that land from the ranchers to grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the forests?
</em><br>
<p>Grab?  We would *buy* those lands for a pittance, and here is how
<br>
this is calculated.  The vast grasslands which I speak of is sometimes
<br>
used to grow grain and alfalfa, both fairly irrigation intensive, with
<br>
razor thin profit margins.  The price of the land is easily estimated by
<br>
taking a typical yearly profit margin, which is about 200 bucks an
<br>
acre year, then divide by the current cost of money.  Right now money
<br>
is about 6%, so that land can be bought up for about 3200 bucks an
<br>
acre, or in other words, practically free.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Will you ban logging to keep the forests from being cut down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as fast as it grows?  Do you think storing enough water inland to lower sea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels is technically easier than curbing pollution?  It almost seems like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your easy alternative is worse than the current suggestions which you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dislike.
</em><br>
<p>Nah, the logging industry will be controlled by the market demand.  What
<br>
I am all about here is pointing out the deplorable level of water control,
<br>
this in the biggie developed nations.  We really need to have better
<br>
control of water.  There is no shortage of fresh water; we dump the
<br>
stuff into the sea at the Sacramento River Delta, at the mouth of the
<br>
Columbia, at the Mississippi River Delta.  We still have *floods* every
<br>
year along the Mississippi, floods!  Why dont we control water better
<br>
than that?  We can do better.
<br>
<p>There is no need to put dykes around Florida, for if we hold
<br>
the sea level we could intentionally warm the planet, melt some of the
<br>
Northern ice and make for more productive land.  We could likely
<br>
keep the Antarctic ice while clearing off most of Greenland and
<br>
much of Siberia.  Of course these are major projects, and currently
<br>
we may have a shortage of people on this planet to get it all done,
<br>
but with encouragement, populations can be expanded to help
<br>
with the project.  We could eco-engineer this planet into one that would
<br>
be a much better place for humans and transhumans.  Perhaps not so
<br>
great for mosquitos as it is today.  Why do we need to have harsh
<br>
climates anywhere, when we have or can develop the technology to
<br>
fix it?  spike
