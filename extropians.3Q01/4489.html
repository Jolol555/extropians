<em>&gt; &gt; I wish the store managers who stayed up nights thinking about how they

<em>&gt;could
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would also come up with some ideas about how best to treat farmworkers.

<em>&gt; &gt; I wish the &quot;immense concentration of knowledge [taking] place in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of a few people who have an enormous incentive to improve the quality of

<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stores&quot; would also develop some incentive to improve the quality of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lives - people who provide the basic foodstuff and products for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stores.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, as we say, &quot;wishes don't make horses&quot;.  What possible incentive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would anyone have to lie awake at night thinking of the best way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;treat farmworkers?   Now, yes, it's easy to imagine &quot;a man on horseback&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as a recent poster put it, or a &quot;Stalin&quot; whose heart would be in the

</em><br>
<p>Hmmm.  What to do.  My heart says &quot;right on Olga!&quot;  But my head says Lee is 
<br>
mostly right.  The farmworkers' basic problem is that they are not paid 
<br>
enough.  Yeah I know they probably have lousy health coverage and other 
<br>
&quot;fringe&quot; benefits, etc.  But if they were paid a decent living wage that 
<br>
would go a long way toward ameliorating the other problems.  But the fact is 
<br>
farmworkers, like most of the rest of us (other than some government and 
<br>
municipal employees and contractors), get paid what the market will bear.
<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
