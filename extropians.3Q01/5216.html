<em>&gt; The key trick is to gather and liquefy the oxygen in the air
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than carrying it up from the surface.  They say the idea is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on a Rand report published in 1987.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyone have any comments on why this idea hasn't been pursued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more seriously in the U.S. or Russia?  It would seem to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tricks here require relatively lightweight machinery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for performing the liquefication and separation.
</em><br>
<p>The air handling equipment is fairly massive and requires very very
<br>
delicate heat exchangers- the liquid hydrogen is passed through millions
<br>
of stainless steel tubes with wall thickness in the single micron
<br>
range.  Dana Andrews gave a presentation at Space Access this April-
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.andrews-space.com/en/news/publications.html">http://www.andrews-space.com/en/news/publications.html</a>
<br>
<p>It has been described by some viewers as a &quot;single stage to NASA
<br>
funding&quot; design- tech candy which pushes the threat of cheap access to
<br>
space decades into the future.
<br>
<p>I have several objections to air liquefaction systems-
<br>
<p>* the system is massive and startlingly complex, thus expensive and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;unreliable
<br>
* the oxygen it produces has substantial argon and nitrogen
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;contamination, reducing performance
<br>
* bulk LOX at $0.05/lb is the second cheapest liquid after water
<br>
* the fuel _must_ be hydrogen, increasing vehicle bulk and drag
<br>
* the system must have airbreathing engines which *also* must be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;hauled to orbit- or else the system is no better than a simple
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;two-stage rocket.  Two stage to orbit is easy- why bother with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;making LOX?
<br>
<p>This all boils down to an impractical, expensive, unreliable, overweight
<br>
system which is extremely unlikely to result in a useful vehicle.  It
<br>
smells like son of X33 to me.
