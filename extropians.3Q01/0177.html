<p>Doesn't that correspond to saying the problem of space flight is much simpler
<br>
than most people think, because most of the complexity of the bird is involved
<br>
in fighting the law of gravity (which spacecraft don't need to worry about).
<br>
See, the space vehicle first has to get out of Earth's gravity well, and
<br>
computer intelligence first has to be organized so that it can self-organize
<br>
to oppose the second law of thermodynamics.

<p><em>&gt; Given the right training data, neural networks

<p>That article is _two years old_. Whatever became of the &quot;Superhuman Speech

<p><em>&gt; I expect this
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>But I thought the Mindpixel Corpus was ready to rock and roll with a MMPI-2...
<br>
Or is that a separate project?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Aside from that, it's important to get as much data as possible. Nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens without the data. Which is why nothing interesting has happened in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI until the advent of large corpi that have allowed us to make statistical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks on classic problems such as machine translation and speech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognition.
</em><br>
<p>So, the human brain, which you say is more complex than necessary, must store
<br>
an enormous amount of data so that it can do interesting things. OK, but
<br>
doesn't that data need to be organized relationally and systematically? How do
<br>
simple algorithms (Self-Organizing Maps and Simple Recurrent Networks) do
<br>
that?

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
