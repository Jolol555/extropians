WASHINGTON (September 14, 2001 8:10 p.m. EDT) - One religious fanatic is
<br>
pretty much like another when it comes to using the Bible or the Koran to
<br>
justify the most unimaginable barbarisms.
<br>
<p>If there was much doubt about this, two of America's champion evangelical
<br>
zealots - Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson - put it to rest with an
<br>
extraordinary example of insensitivity and bad taste. Both voiced the belief
<br>
that the deaths of thousands of Americans at the hands of terrorists was
<br>
inspired by God as a way of getting even with those who condone feminism,
<br>
homosexuality, abortion rights and any number of civil liberties the two
<br>
have no use for.
<br>
<p>&quot;God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America to give
<br>
us probably what we deserve,&quot; Falwell said during a television appearance on
<br>
Robertson's &quot;700 Club,&quot; a Christian Broadcast Network showcase of right-wing
<br>
religious dogma with an audience of millions. Robertson agreed as Falwell
<br>
added U.S. courts and groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and
<br>
People for the American Way to his list of villains.
<br>
<p>&quot;The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not
<br>
be mocked,&quot; he was quoted as saying. &quot;I really believe that the pagans and
<br>
the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and lesbians who are
<br>
actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle ... all of them who
<br>
have tried to secularize American - I point the finger in their face and
<br>
say, 'You helped this happen.'&quot;
<br>
<p>The White House couldn't distance itself quickly enough, immediately calling
<br>
the jarring remarks &quot;inappropriate&quot; and even adding, unnecessarily one would
<br>
think, that President Bush doesn't share those views. At a time of almost
<br>
unprecedented unity in this nation, it was a dismaying, discordant and
<br>
decidedly &quot;un-Christian&quot; display and one that should have long-lasting
<br>
reverberations even among those who share this pair's social positions.
<br>
<p>Falwell, of course, did not mention that one of the probable heroes in this
<br>
worst of all domestic tragedies was a young gay, a rugby player named Mark
<br>
Bingham, who, it is believed, helped overpower hijackers who planned on
<br>
crashing the airliner into a Washington target. The plane was forced down in
<br>
Pennsylvania, with the loss of all aboard but saving who knows how many more
<br>
lives in the nation's capital.
<br>
<p>Do these sanctimonious boobs believe for one moment that among the
<br>
firefighters and police and other rescue workers who lost their lives and
<br>
among the thousands who are still striving to save more there aren't gays
<br>
and lesbians and people who believe in abortion rights? Do they actually
<br>
believe that God would spit on any of his children because of their social
<br>
beliefs - that in the process he would condone the killing of innocents who
<br>
fear and worship him?
<br>
<p>Well, we have an answer to those questions. They do.
<br>
<p>During the Republican presidential primary campaign, Sen. John McCain
<br>
roundly denounced the concepts of both men and their followers at great
<br>
expense to his chances. The speech he made in Virginia was a political
<br>
mistake, but he was right. In sharp contrast to the mean-spiritedness of
<br>
Falwell and Robertson were the healing words of a truly religious man, the
<br>
Rev. Billy Graham, who led the nation Friday in a prayer of renewal.
<br>
<p>This is, after all, a free country and these men are allowed to speak their
<br>
minds freely and believe whatever they like, no matter how contradictory to
<br>
the precepts of the religion they preach, like tolerance and compassion and
<br>
forgiveness. They quite clearly would deny that privilege to others. But
<br>
there are consequences to those actions. One of those should be general
<br>
condemnation even from their followers who pump millions and millions of
<br>
dollars into their coffers to support their television &quot;ministries&quot; and
<br>
evangelical &quot;universities.&quot; Voting a resounding &quot;no&quot; to this behavior with
<br>
one's checkbook would be quite appropriate.
<br>
<p>Moreover, the Baptist Church at the very least should move to censure
<br>
Falwell, whose latest example of political and religious insensitivity
<br>
should now be embarrassing to even the more rigidly fundamentalist arms of
<br>
the church. Liberty University should disassociate itself from this
<br>
millstone of intolerance. The use of the title &quot;Reverend&quot; for such a person
<br>
is not only a mockery to Christianity, but is blasphemous.
<br>
<p>Obviously, the president of the United States has more to do in these days
<br>
of crisis than to worry about the ranting of two religious nuts whose
<br>
beliefs are not terribly unlike those who perpetrated this crime against
<br>
humanity. But when he gets some time, he should make it abundantly clear
<br>
that he wants nothing more to do with either of them.
