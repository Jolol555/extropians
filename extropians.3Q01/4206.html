<p>Well, cybergnosticism - the material world is inefficient and impure, and we
<br>
should strive to become pure information - is unfortunately rampant among
<br>
transhumanists. But that doesn't mean it is a very workable philosophy, IMHO.
<br>
<p>As I see it, uploads are still going to be embodied. As I argued at
<br>
TransVision 00 in London, uploads might actually be more obsessed with their
<br>
bodies than we are currently! The reason is that an upload doesn't really
<br>
lose his body when he is uploaded, but rather gains an extra body: a primary
<br>
embodiment as computer hardware and associated electricity patterns, as well
<br>
as the emulation of his original flesh body. The emulation is necessary since
<br>
our brains are wired to interact with the world through the body and cannot
<br>
easily do this without a very close analog to the original body. Also, many
<br>
of our emotional states seem to be based not just in our brain neural
<br>
networks but use bodily states as markers (the somatic marker hypothesis of
<br>
Antonio Damasio). Over time this emulation might be changed, outgrown and
<br>
eventually discarded, but that will take plenty of time. 
<br>
<p>In the meantime the upload - who is likely not directly aware of the primary
<br>
computational body - will have to come to terms with his new ontological
<br>
status. I have a hard time imagining that uploads would not often try to feel
<br>
if their thoughts or visceral feelings have become somehow different. If any
<br>
subjective difference is experienced, that will be felt as deeply
<br>
significant, and different uploads might react very differently to it - some
<br>
might want to tune their bodies to fit their old selves, others might wear
<br>
the difference as a badge denoting their new status and others will begin to
<br>
play around with the possibilities of changing their bodies. So in the end, I
<br>
believe uploads will be firmly embodied beings, it is just that their bodies
<br>
will likely be very different from anything we consider bodies today. 
<br>
<p>I think transhumanism needs a good perspective of embodiment to avoid
<br>
becoming dualist or cybergnostic. It is easy to say that one wants to change
<br>
one's body, but implicit in that statement is the assumption that the change
<br>
will not change oneself. This is not true; any change of the body is a change
<br>
of oneself.
