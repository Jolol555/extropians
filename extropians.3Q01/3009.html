<p>
<em>&gt;Beware extropians, they will come for the AIs, and then the transhumans 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;next. Anything smacking of technology and the &quot;artificial&quot;, especially of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things once &quot;natural&quot;, will surely catch their attention.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely true.
<br>
<p>The question is what do we do about it? I await the attitude of the US 
<br>
Senate to the proposed theocratic anti-cloning law. I am not optimistic. 
<br>
Locally, I await a government report that is supposed to be coming out any 
<br>
day now making recommendations to the Australian legislature on cloning and 
<br>
stem cell research. There's a strong theocratic element on the committee 
<br>
doing this report.
<br>
<p>However, it's not just cloning. We've already entered the &quot;singularity 
<br>
shadow&quot;, folks, the time when the prospect of transhuman technologies - the 
<br>
shadow of the looming Spike ahead - causes intellectual ferment and 
<br>
political opposition. We've got to play our part in this ferment. At the 
<br>
moment, we're being overwhelmed by various kinds of neo-Luddite memes.
<br>
<p>I can't think of much to do at the moment except, from a personal viewpoint, 
<br>
become as embroiled in the issues as I can in the public debate, using 
<br>
resources such as this list to help me, and to encourage others to do 
<br>
likewise (and offer my help!). Oh, and try to be/sound *very* reasonable. 
<br>
Some of the anti-tech arguments will not simply be theocratic bullshit and 
<br>
will make sense. We need to deal with this patiently.
<br>
<p>If we want really long lives, possible immortality, etc, we've got to be 
<br>
prepared to get through several decades of strife (we can't depend on 
<br>
optimistic scenarios). For the over 40s on the list (like me) that alone 
<br>
will be a challenge. We need a lot of reasonable-sounding transhumanist 
<br>
public intellectuals to get on stream fast to contest the views of the 
<br>
neo-Luddites. Oh, and I think we also need (perhaps moreso) transhumanist 
<br>
artists (Natasha, Miriam...), rock bands (Emlyn...), fiction writers (well, 
<br>
take a bow Damien, but you're also just about our best public intellectual) 
<br>
and on and on to get the memes out in a popular way. We need people putting 
<br>
forward our viewpoint in the academies. We need people who can reconcile 
<br>
transhumanism with the views of those who have &quot;spiritual&quot; yearnings, while 
<br>
sounding (again) very calm and reasonable (Samantha?). Go for it, guys - all 
<br>
of you on the list who can afford time from the actual AI etc work.
<br>
<p>I know you're all doing this stuff already (aren't you?). This is just a pep 
<br>
talk (and a restatement of my standing offer to help, and an acknowledgment 
<br>
of the excellent help that I've found is available here).
<br>
<p>(It'd be nice if this list didn't seem so extreme in its political 
<br>
philosophies - which would repel most intellectuals and get us offside 
<br>
before we even start the social debate. But so be it, I'm not asking anyone 
<br>
to be a hypocrite.)
<br>
<p>Live long! Live free! Ascend!
<br>
<p>Russell (trying to pump himself up a bit here &lt;g&gt;)
