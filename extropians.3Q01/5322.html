No implications ... except that we should not make the mistake of
<br>
expecting corporations to behave like human beings, or have human
<br>
interests at heart.
<br>
<p>(Some -- like me -- draw the conclusion from this that corporations,
<br>
being legal entities established to promote the common good of humans,
<br>
should be wound up/shut down/fixed whenever their activities contradict
<br>
the common good. But just where to draw the line in the sand is an,
<br>
um, interesting question.)
