From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Morphological%20Freedom&In-Reply-To=&lt;086401c12454$02b42de0$1a5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; Overall the trend seems to be towards more freedom, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that requires continual intense debating and also making sure we do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end up with a lot of disparate rights but no overall right to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bodies.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm not so sure the trend is towards more freedom where I live. The CHP
<br>
(Cognitively Handicapped Police), are in the habit of arresting and
<br>
imprisoning people simply because they have altered the level of alcohol in
<br>
their blood. And if there's a so-called &quot;national emergency,&quot; young men have
<br>
no right to their bodies at all, because their bodies are subject to military
<br>
conscription.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think there is a certain internal resistance in most people to change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their bodies because it means dealing with changing one's self-image
</em><br>
<p>If morphological freedom extends to changing the brain, this resistance can be
<br>
overcome chemically (and easily). A change in brain chemistry via psychoactive
<br>
drugs can dramatically alter self-image.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (this is why transsexuals are far more eager to do it than many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handicapped - their self-images are from the start different from their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bodies and remain so, while many disabled people adapt their body images
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to their bodies). Since most of us are human-looking from the start and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have human-like self images I guess radical changes will not easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occur for a long time. Similar things goes for mental restructuring.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I see what you mean. I would nonetheless suggest that a rich old geezer
<br>
may find the prospect of morphing into an energetic youth rather attractive.
<br>
That's the kind of morphological freedom I think has a bright and popular
<br>
future. So maybe you could add that perspective to your paper.
