<p>I think I'll argue that &quot;religion&quot; is a suitcase term.
<br>
<p>religion: 1. belief in and worhip of God or gods; 2. a specific system
<br>
of belief or worship, etc. built around God, a code of ethics, a philosophy
<br>
of life, etc.
<br>
<p><p>There is nothing wrong with having a &quot;religion&quot; that is based on a system
<br>
of beliefs that can be rationally justified or one that openly acknowledges
<br>
its inability to be rationally justified.  For example a religion of worshiping
<br>
&quot;God&quot;, the creator of the simulation, seems perfectly reasonable to me
<br>
if it also acknowledges that there is no way of knowing whether or not we
<br>
are in a simulation.  It might marginally increase ones chances of getting
<br>
uplifted out of the simulation and so being a member of the &quot;Church of
<br>
the Simulation&quot; be argued as a rationally wise life strategy.  The fundamental
<br>
problem is that most religions breed lazy minds.  You &quot;believe&quot; the moral
<br>
system and history offered by the religion and do not subject it to critical
<br>
(rational) analysis.  The problem is not the &quot;beliefs&quot; but how one comes
<br>
to believe them.
<br>
<p>The basic principles of most religions result in behavioral axioms
<br>
that we know are extropic -- thou shalt not lie, thou shalt not kill,
<br>
do unto others as you would have them do unto you, etc.  These fundamental
<br>
principles are extropic because they generate trust for fellow humans
<br>
which allows us to interact in ways that are more efficient from a game
<br>
theoretic perspective.
<br>
<p>The useless hypothesis here is not &quot;religion&quot; per se.  It is irrational
<br>
faith or faith based on a lack of evidence that does not openly acknowledge
<br>
such lack of evidence.
<br>
<p>The extropic perspective should not be to dump on &quot;religion&quot; per se.
<br>
The extropic perspective would be to open the minds of people to the
<br>
variety of religions that may be equally valid and in so doing perhaps
<br>
discover the core set of values and perspectives that uplift humanity
<br>
as a whole.
<br>
<p>As Charlie's excellent essay points out, the Islamic preservation of large
<br>
amounts of &quot;Western&quot; knowledge contributed greatly to the reformation
<br>
and uplifting of Western society from the Dark Ages to what we have today.
<br>
Likewise, the copying of many Greek and Latin books by monks during the
<br>
Dark Ages preserved a heritage that might otherwise have been lost.
<br>
<p>Religion is not the problem.  It is blind acceptance of a religion that 
<br>
is.
