<em>&gt; Evidently so.  Very well, I'll amplify.  You can call me &quot;white&quot;, but if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you do, I reserve the right to tell you to take a hike.  I'm a sentient

<em>&gt; being.  If you want to lump me in with any smaller group than that, you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so at your own risk and without my consent.
</em><br>
<p>I often put quotes around the word &quot;race&quot; (implying &quot;so-called&quot;).   I agree
<br>
with you that we are all one species, and that's supported scientifically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see no reason why I should identify more with slaveowners who happen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be white more than I should identify with slaves who happen to be back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They're both humans, they're both sentients, and they're both a part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth's history.  Why should I identify with one group above the other?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why should I accept &quot;responsibility&quot; for acts committed to people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belonging to a group I never identified myself with?  Because I have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same skin color?  Now *that's* racist.
</em><br>
<p>I don't identify with slaveowners or slaves, either (I'm the spawn of a
<br>
degenerated autocracy, not even of this country). And I think it's excellent
<br>
that you don't identify with any one group.  But if this means you regard
<br>
all people as &quot;sentients, why would you NOT identify with that group you
<br>
claim &quot;[You] never identified [yourself] with?&quot;  You're a sentient.  They're
<br>
sentients.  What's not to &quot;identify with&quot;?
<br>
<p>Be that as it may, you certainly never have to accept responsibility for
<br>
acts committed to people with whom you never identified (even if you and
<br>
they are siblings under the skin, a/k/a sentients).  Why should you?  I
<br>
never suggested this (have I?).
<br>
<p>While you may be enlightened (and I salute you for that), you've probably
<br>
observed that most people are not.  You've also probably observed a whole
<br>
underclass of people who - while they may want to be enlightened like you,
<br>
and would like to forget about all this nasty &quot;race&quot; business - they cannot.
<br>
They cannot because they are constantly being reminded of it.  If you were a
<br>
black male, you would have to be careful if you went jogging in a &quot;white&quot;
<br>
neighborhood (even if it were your very own neighborhood).  You would have
<br>
to remember to always, always have  some identification on you, as you may
<br>
get pulled over, and without identification ... off to jail you go.  And why
<br>
would you be pulled over?  Why, for being black.  You'd like to forget about
<br>
&quot;race.&quot;  You'd like to call yourself an &quot;American.&quot;  You'd like to tell the
<br>
policeman you're a &quot;sentient.&quot;  But you're afraid that if you tell the
<br>
policeman you're a &quot;sentient,&quot; they may not just put you in jail - they'll
<br>
put you in a hospital.  And throw away the key.  But, oh, what you'd give
<br>
not to have to think about &quot;race.&quot;   What a luxury that would be.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Now, if somebody wants to voluntarily say &quot;I am American&quot;, then there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be cause to ask them to be proud or ashamed of things that Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have done.
</em><br>
<p>I'm with you, Eliezer.  I, too, don't identify myself as an &quot;American&quot; so
<br>
much as a &quot;citizen of the world.&quot;   When I say I'm Russian, I'm referring,
<br>
of course, to the things my own family may have caused to be proud or
<br>
ashamed of (pogroms and other assorted czarist shennanigans) ... until we
<br>
moved to our adopted country.  But as I now live in America, I cannot help
<br>
noticing there are many sad, broken, angry people here, often referred to as
<br>
&quot;African Americans,&quot; but who are actually sentient beings, just like
<br>
me --just like my new friend, Eliezer.  None of us now alive are
<br>
responsible, but we are living with the result of horrors Americans
<br>
perpetrated a long time ago for hundreds of years - to the ancestors of some
<br>
of the wounded people I see now.  I'm not responsible, but I care.
<br>
<p>Eliezer:
<br>
But my email address is <a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Fw:%20`capitalist'%20character%20values&In-Reply-To=&lt;010a01c117fe$7b6fc8a0$2179afce@braniac&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</a>, not
<br>
<em>&gt; american@pobox.com.
</em><br>
<p>Hooray!  Now think about why you said you can't identify yourself with other
<br>
sentients, and let me know what you come up with.  I'm a little puzzled
<br>
about this one aspect of your post.
