Technically the containment is the steel inner structure, the concrete
<br>
building you see is the shield building and there is a space between the two
<br>
(usually around 15 feet or so, called the annulus. A 100% melt down which
<br>
breaches the reactor vessel bottom IS expected to eventually penetrate the
<br>
floor (china syndrome) and then reach a thick layer of silica rich soil
<br>
which then glasses and effectively shields fuel goo. I know of no
<br>
containment/shield building in the US specifically designed to withstand the
<br>
direct strike of a 747 at full speed, that was not considered a credible
<br>
risk when these things were disigned.  I think they most certainly would,
<br>
the rebar in the shield building is as thick around as your forearm and
<br>
there is so much of it you would think there was more metal than concrete in
<br>
the structure.

Subject: Containment buildings
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; At random I looked up some facts on two different containment buildings
</em><br>
for nuclear
<br>
<em>&gt; reactors in the USA, I assume others are similar. The wall on one was 3.9
</em><br>
feet thick
<br>
<em>&gt; and made of concrete lined with 1/4 inch steel plate, the other was 3 feet
</em><br>
thick lined
<br>
<em>&gt; with 2 inch steel plate. I think even a 747 would have trouble blasting
</em><br>
through that.
<br>
<em>&gt; The foundation of both (China syndrome protection) was about 10 feet
</em><br>
thick.
