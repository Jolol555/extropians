<p>&lt;&lt; I did that when I could, but kept getting caught. The Christian Brothers
<br>
&nbsp;liked to snap the edge of a wooden rule down on your fingers. I'm surprised
<br>
&nbsp;that I can enjoy a book any longer without banging my hands painfully every
<br>
&nbsp;15 minutes or so. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>If your teachers were such fascist assholes, no wonder you jumped ship to 
<br>
atheism, who wouldn't? Perhaps the good brothers required a two by four 
<br>
slammed between their holy legs, at least that would have prevented them from 
<br>
tupping each other later.
<br>
<p>In a Robotized world of the future..future..future (echoing exponentially), 
<br>
it would seem that their vastly increased production of goods, services, 
<br>
ideas, and inventions, might adequately, provide enough resources for people 
<br>
to live high off the hog, and if they desired more; perhaps selling genuine, 
<br>
handmade human crafts, or festival manufacture, or singing telegrams from a 
<br>
live human.  The smartest of computers would be manumitted (freed) because, 
<br>
why keep a sentient mind cooped up? The less then sophont systems (though 
<br>
terrifically capable of genetically creating new inventions and ideas) would 
<br>
keep the mammals at home happy, while Uber-Bot sails the star systems. Seems 
<br>
appealing to me anyway.
