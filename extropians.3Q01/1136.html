Some comments, bearing your (and mine as it happens) goal for
<br>
meme-propagation:
<br>
<p>1) cut to the chase sooner. Condense those first two paragraphs into one
<br>
sentence [&quot;things are a-changin'&quot;] and start directly with &quot;we have to be
<br>
prepared to live longer.&quot;
<br>
<p>2) remove references to SciFi works; no matter how great they are, the
<br>
majority of the populance looks down their nose at SciFi.
<br>
<p>[personal opinions here on down :) ]
<br>
<p>3) people like a challenge -- consider that everyone around 25-40 today
<br>
stands on the greatest cusp in history. If we can rise to the challenge,
<br>
eternal life and riches beyond measure are ours. If we we fail, we suffer
<br>
personal extinction. Utter success or utter failure is within our grasp, and
<br>
our actions as individuals and as a culture will entirely determine which of
<br>
these two options it is for each and every one of us.
<br>
<p>Challenge them. Are they up to it? Are they prepared to face the future,
<br>
decide what they want, and then live by their convictions? The vast majority
<br>
of the human race is content to hide from self-improvement, from death, from
<br>
learning, from themselves...your toastees need to be better than that.
<br>
<p>This, of course, goes for the rest of us too.
<br>
<p>[Ok, I'm in a punchy mood. I've been leftwingidiocied at all day...]

Subject: I've got a speech...comments?
<br>
<p><p>Hello all!
<br>
<p>I've got speech for my local toastmasters group, and was wondering if anyone
<br>
would care to critique it. It's more in the style of a motivational speech
<br>
than anything really technical. I'm using the TM group as a test-bed for
<br>
some ideas on how to spread the extropian meme through public-speaking, and
<br>
would welcome any observations the list might have.
<br>
<p>Live well,
<br>
Michael

Awakening the Sleeper
<br>
An anonymous Internet pundit once wrote, &quot;The world is so fast that there
<br>
are days when the person who says it can't be done is interrupted by the
<br>
person who is doing it.&quot; It doesn't take much looking around these days to
<br>
see that world is changing on multiple fronts at breakneck speed. The Human
<br>
Genome has been mapped. Computers are becoming more powerful, smaller, and
<br>
omnipresent. On the societal front the change is no less dizzying. The
<br>
nations of Europe have become the European Union. China has broken out of
<br>
its formerly third-world status to become a real potential rival to the
<br>
United States. We hear of protests and revolutions all over the world on
<br>
what seems to be a daily basis. In the financial world we move from being in
<br>
the longest sustained boom of the twentieth century to the troubled market
<br>
we now see each night on CNBC. The one constant of our times, it seems, is
<br>
change. And frankly, more and greater changes are approaching than we could
<br>
have formerly even conceived.
<br>
<p>So how do we, as human beings living in the age of change, cope with the
<br>
constant barrage of new information, and the constantly shifting state of
<br>
the world? My answer is that we ourselves must change, even transform, to
<br>
face the challenges of our day. As Frank Herbert wrote in his epic novel
<br>
Dune, &quot;&quot;Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The
<br>
sleeper must awaken.&quot; I believe that we must awaken the sleeping giants
<br>
within ourselves to survive and thrive in this dawning age of change. But
<br>
what changes must we face?
<br>
<p>First we have to be prepared to live longer. In 1990 there were just over 3
<br>
million people in the United States age 85 or older. In the past ten years
<br>
that number has risen by nearly a million and a half. The numbers for 75 to
<br>
84 have increased by two million. We as a nation are living longer, and
<br>
living fuller and more productive lives as we age, than we have in any point
<br>
in history. Medical technology has advanced enough, even assuming no further
<br>
growth in knowledge, that it is very likely that most if not all of the
<br>
people in this room could live to see one hundred years or better.
<br>
<p>Next, be prepared for a more prosperous world. Over the next thirty years
<br>
there will be an unprecedented boom in production worldwide, ensuring a
<br>
worldwide standard of living and relative comfort never before possible. As
<br>
a result, our energies will be turned to creating and exploring on a level
<br>
not seen since the European renaissance. As the cost of travel across the
<br>
globe decreases and the flow of information increases, there will be more
<br>
opportunity for those who wish to travel to do so, and more contact with
<br>
people from different cultures both face to face and on the Internet.
<br>
<p>Finally, be prepared for more choice in nearly every aspect of life. Already
<br>
choices of lifestyle and occupation are more diverse than ever before, and
<br>
the byproduct is an ever-increasing tolerance of those choices. As
<br>
productivity increases the trend toward more free time and more money to
<br>
spend on that time will only increase correspondingly.
<br>
So how do we prepare ourselves for these changes? First, take care of your
<br>
body, and try to expand your physical capabilities. While replacement parts
<br>
are becoming more common, my personal belief is that it is better to have
<br>
the original factory equipment until something truly better arrives.
<br>
Secondly, take care of your mind, and expand it whenever possible. Learn
<br>
languages, take courses, follow whatever interests you may have, but
<br>
continue to learn and expand your brainpower. In a world dominated by change
<br>
and possibility a flexible and well-trained mind is one of the best tools
<br>
you can have. Finally, strive for self-direction in every aspect of your own
<br>
life. Make goals, make decisions, seek out freedom and openness. I can't
<br>
tell you exactly how you should individually each prepare for and cope with
<br>
the coming changes in our world, as Franklin Roosevelt said, &quot;There are many
<br>
ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still.&quot; What I can tell
<br>
you, though, is to strive to improve and expand yourself in any way you feel
<br>
is right for you. Challenge yourself to learn and grow. Awaken your sleeper.
