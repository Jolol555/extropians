<em>&gt; Well, my personal opinion is that education is the prime problem, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the prime solution.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, most school educations don't include courses on how to make
<br>
it in the real world, especially for students from disadvantaged
<br>
backgrounds.
<br>
<p>Any ideas on making USEFUL educations available--not necessarily just for
<br>
poor kids, but for all kids who're interested? It might be a worthwhile
<br>
Extropian project.
<br>
<p>I know a public school teacher in Lockhart, Texas who's using gardening as a
<br>
way of reaching kids who don't like books. I interviewed some of the kids
<br>
for a magazine article and was told by several of them that they used to
<br>
hate going to school but now enjoy it because of the garden (they were
<br>
growing all sorts of plants, including food, useful stuff such as gourds,
<br>
and native ornamentals), and were in the process of installing a fish pond.
<br>
When kids have a reason to learn, they'll learn. These kids had been
<br>
inspired by the garden to learn about botany, weather, genetics, chemistry,
<br>
folklore, economics, design, math, and more. We're a poor community, and
<br>
some of the students are from homes where there are no books at all.
