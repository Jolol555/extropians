<p>
I hope this is deemed list-appropriate.
<br>
<p>During World War II, families put a blue star in their window for each 
<br>
family member in the service.  The star was changed to gold if the 
<br>
serviceman died; there were also other variations for POW, etc.  The stars 
<br>
were also not necessarily for blood family; if someone had been 'adopted' 
<br>
by a family, they warranted a star.
<br>
<p>I checked on the web and created bitmaps that have the exact proportions 
<br>
and colors of the stars that were used then.  I'm going to put one in my 
<br>
window.  We qualify for two stars.  I'm sending it to you, in case you want 
<br>
to do the same.  Attached are one and two star versions.  It should be very 
<br>
easy for you to resize as needed or to add stars.
<br>
<p>Feel free to forward this email, with attribution, to anyone you know who 
<br>
may have family in the armed forces, or to other mailing lists.  I suppose 
<br>
a gold star version would be appropriate for anyone who was a victim of the 
<br>
attacks.  The RGB for the gold is (219,219,0).
<br>
