<p>Some of the things you list, such as not having bank accounts or credit

cards, not using ID cards, are inconvenient.
<br>
<p>The only reason I can think of not to allow oneself into various databases
<br>
is that one might someday need to hide from someone who has access to such
<br>
databases. But maybe there are other reasons I'm missing.
<br>
<p>If one wishes to maintain a degree of anonymity to leave open the option of
<br>
hiding, it would seem to make more sense to develop one or more alternative
<br>
identities one could step into if the need should arise. Refusing to produce
<br>
ID cards, insisting on using cash for large purchases and so forth draw
<br>
attention to a person rather than protecting their anonymity.
<br>
<p>People I've known who've experienced life under conditions of political
<br>
instability say it's wise to have passports from at least two nation-states.
