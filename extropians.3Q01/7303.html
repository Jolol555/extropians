</em><br>
<em>&gt;they said nothing, so they join the huge list of soothsayers who have

<p>They have also joined the huge list of seismologists who find big jags on

their recording graphs after a major earthquake, but remain unable to
<br>
predict such events. Does this mean earthquakes don't affect seismographs? 
<br>
<p>What is very odd and interesting here is the claim (as I understand it)
<br>
that when a bunch of independent and geographically isolated random number
<br>
generators are left running, their output can be found to track some of the
<br>
impalpable shock waves of emotion triggered in huge populations by some
<br>
common tragedy or triumph. 
<br>
<p>If this is the case (and of course I find it hard to credit), it might tell
<br>
us something remarkable about the world, something that contemporary
<br>
physics seems to make no room for. 
<br>
<p>So I don't know if it's true, but John's comments fail to address the
<br>
claim. (Of course we can guess that it must all rigged, or they made it up
<br>
completely, or there are many other spikes in the data they're not
<br>
revealing, or they trawled until they found what they wanted; all of these
<br>
counter-claims are denied by the academics involved.)
<br>
<p>One of the researchers responded to Eliezer's skeptical commentary about
<br>
`data torture', which I had fwd'd (sans Eli's name):
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Dean Radin and I have ongoing, independent analysis efforts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We have been doing a great deal of validity checking[...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We are gradually processing the whole database to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether anything like the major structures associated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;September 11 appear anywhere else.  So far, going back
</em><br>
<em>&gt;several months, there is nothing like it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The analyses are made available on the GCP website,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://noosphere.princeton.edu">http://noosphere.princeton.edu</a> as soon as we have crosschecked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them.  The most recent addition is a report by Dean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;details the tortures leading to what we both believe is good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evidence for a premonitory aspect and distance correlations.
</em><br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<em>&gt;All the data are available for download from the website, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you can do any sort of inspection you wish.  [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Almost all of what you see on the website
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pages concerning the terrorist attacks is exploratory work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that we do not include in the formal statistical assessment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- and I do try to make that distinction clear.
</em><br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<em>&gt;We have a clear hypothesis, and the predictions we make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;based on that require by definition knowing where to look.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Simply put, the terrible events of September 11 are exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;where to look&quot;.  And when we look there, we find extraordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;structure -- and we don't find anything like it elsewhere.
