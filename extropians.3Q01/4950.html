The NY Times discusses this here:
<br>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/24/health/genetics/24GENO.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/24/health/genetics/24GENO.html</a>
<br>
<p>Its apparently work done by scientists at the Novartis
<br>
Genomics Institute in San Diego.
<br>
<p>I think I've seen another report as well based on work done
<br>
on the East coast.
<br>
<p>Here is the problem.  The historic paradigm has been
<br>
one gene = one protein.  That idea works pretty well in
<br>
bacteria but as been under slow erosion in higher organisms
<br>
as the scientists have found genes that have alternate
<br>
splice variants and proteins that may be cleaved into
<br>
different forms by proteases (the primary player in
<br>
Alzheimer's disease fits this pattern).
<br>
<p>So for years the concept of a &quot;gene&quot; has been getting fuzzy.
<br>
It is bordering on being what Minsky calls a &quot;suitcase word&quot;
<br>
at this point.  The estimates of 100K-140K genes were based
<br>
on &quot;Expressed Sequence Tag&quot; (EST) libraries done by Human Genome
<br>
Sciences, Incyte and a publicly funded effort.  The number
<br>
of &quot;genes&quot; found by Celera and the public effort announced
<br>
in February were based on what programs designed to recognize
<br>
genes could identify in the sequence data.  My conclusion from
<br>
the NY Times article is that the Celera group and the public
<br>
group were using different programs to identify the &quot;genes&quot;.
<br>
The other groups that are weighing in now are trying to
<br>
integrate the Celera and public data and match that up
<br>
with the EST data.
<br>
<p>My opinion at this point is leaning towards 40-50,000
<br>
&quot;transcription regions&quot; in the genome that end up getting
<br>
expressed and generate probably 120K-140K proteins.
<br>
<p>Recent papers, I think in Science, have revised upwards
<br>
the gene count in both Drosophila and C. elegans.  so
<br>
we haven't reached the bottom of the genome barrel yet
<br>
but we are getting there.
<br>
<p>Harvey, you have to give the scientists a break here -- they
<br>
were under a lot of pressure to announce progress here.
<br>
You aren't going to see any reasonable discussion about
<br>
the fraction of genes that they missed or how they missed
<br>
them in the public press.  You have to go into a detailed
<br>
analysis of the published literature.  Thats probably
<br>
approaching 100+ pages at this point.
