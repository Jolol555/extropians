<p>FAA Plans to Disarm Flight Crews
<br>
By Jeff Johnson
<br>
CNSNews.com Congressional Bureau Chief
<br>
September 20, 2001
<br>
<p>(Editor's note: Adds quotations from pilots)
<br>
<p>(CNSNews.com) - A new Federal Aviation Regulation would take away the right
<br>
of pilots, co-pilots, and navigators to carry firearms and other weapons for
<br>
self-defense.
<br>
<p>Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Paul Takemoto acknowledged
<br>
Thursday that flight crews have been authorized to carry firearms for the
<br>
past 20 years.
<br>
<p>&quot;That will change on November 14,&quot; he said. &quot;The new rule will not include
<br>
authorization (to carry firearms) and crew members will no longer be allowed
<br>
to carry arms.&quot;
<br>
<p>Federal Aviation Regulation 108.11 currently allows armed individuals on
<br>
aircraft, &quot;if the person having the weapon is authorized to have the weapon
<br>
by the (airline) and the Administrator (of the FAA) and has successfully
<br>
completed a course of training in the use of firearms acceptable to the
<br>
Administrator.&quot;
<br>
<p>That federal aviation regulation also establishes the conditions under which
<br>
law enforcement officers and other government officials may be armed on
<br>
board aircraft. Takemoto indicated ther would be no changes to those
<br>
regulations.
<br>
<p>Takemoto was not aware of whether or not the FAA had ever approved a
<br>
firearms training course for flight crews, or whether such a request had
<br>
ever been made. He indicated that the agency was too busy to research the
<br>
issue in light of the on-going investigation into the hijacking of four
<br>
passenger jets by terrorists armed with plastic knives and box cutters on
<br>
September 11.
<br>
<p>In response to those attacks, the Front Sight Firearms Training Institute in
<br>
Las Vegas, Nevada, offered weapons training specifically designed for
<br>
cockpit crews free to any pilot, co-pilot, or navigator, if their employer
<br>
requests the training. Dr. Ignatius Piazza, founder of Front Sight, was
<br>
outraged by the FAA's decision.
<br>
<p>&quot;The FAA, in changing the regulation, and preventing the airlines from
<br>
arming and training their pilots effectively places the blood on their hands
<br>
for every (future) terrorist act involving the take-over of a cockpit of an
<br>
airplane,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, agreed.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is simply going to insure, and reassure the terrorists, that they will
<br>
be the only ones armed. They will break the law, because they're criminals,
<br>
and they'll be able to repeat exactly what was done,&quot; Pratt said.
<br>
<p>&quot;These people haven't learned a thing,&quot; he continued, &quot;and they need to be
<br>
fired, because anybody who thinks self defense is a bad idea doesn't belong
<br>
in public service.&quot;
<br>
<p>The FAA's new regulation is also directly at odds with legislation
<br>
introduced by Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) last Friday.
<br>
<p>House Resolution (HR) 2896 would provide that, &quot;no department or agency of
<br>
the Federal Government shall prohibit any pilot, copilot, or navigator of an
<br>
aircraft, or any law enforcement personnel specifically detailed for the
<br>
protection of that aircraft, from carrying a firearm.&quot;
<br>
<p>Takemoto said the FAA does not comment on pending legislation.
<br>
<p>Paul believes pilots should be able to defend themselves and their
<br>
passengers.
<br>
<p>&quot;My approach to this is to allow an airline to take care of their property
<br>
just like we allow our chemical plants and our refineries to protect their
<br>
property,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Paul compared the fences and armed guards around such plants to airliners
<br>
with fortified cockpit doors and an armed crew flight crew
<br>
<p>Paul expressed astonishment that the terrorists were able to commandeer four
<br>
airliners without firearms.
<br>
<p>&quot;They did all that without a gun,&quot; he said. &quot;If the pilots had had guns,
<br>
they could have prevented this.&quot;
<br>
<p>In a letter to the editor of the Wall Street Journal (Friday, Sept. 21), an
<br>
American Airlines captain agreed that &quot;hardened cockpit doors and armed
<br>
pilots could have prevented all four of those hijackings.&quot;
<br>
<p>Captain Brad Rohdenburg suggested making some of the pilots sky marshals.
<br>
&quot;How much more cost-effective could a security program be?&quot; he asked.
<br>
<p>&quot;At the very least, let us carry pocket knives again. As Benjamin Franklin
<br>
said, 'If you make yourselves sheep, the wolves will eat you.'&quot;
