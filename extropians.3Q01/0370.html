<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; &quot;Nuclear power can play a significant role in mitigating climate change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  There are no insurmountable technical barriers to nuclear expansion, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the expansion must be performed under very high safety standards.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Additionally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  capital cost reductions from advanced designs and production methods will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  required. It is therefore important to maintain and intensify current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of research and development on power reactors, waste disposal, and nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  safeguards to assure that safe nuclear power is available when needed&quot; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                                             Questions Arise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can these power plants be diversion-resistant?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it economically, competitive in the marketplace?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is switching to a thorium-cycle from a uranium-cycle, a possible assistance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the above mentioned questions?
</em><br>
<p>If carbon tax based methods of reinternalizing CO2 externalities of
<br>
fossil fuel energy sources are instituted, nuclear power actually
<br>
becomes one of the most affordable power sources. Today it is the only
<br>
one that is mandated by law to internalize its externalities (i.e. pay
<br>
for disposal of its waste products, even of all materials from the
<br>
decommissioned plant) to the point that the concrete that is used in
<br>
plant construction has to be disposed of at nuke customer expense,
<br>
despite the fact that much of the latent radioactivity in the concrete
<br>
is actually due to the radioactive fly ash mixed in the concrete during
<br>
plant construction, fly ash that is produced by coal plants, thereby
<br>
causing nuke customers to pay an externality of coal burning power
<br>
sources. If coal customers are required to pay this, and other
<br>
externalities, coal then becomes a minimum of four times more expensive
<br>
than its current day cost.
