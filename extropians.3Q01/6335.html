<em>&gt; The way to get rid of terrorism against us is to make the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I would say the repercussions are already on that level. The problem is
<br>
not the sane terrorists, it is the insane ones. No threat whatsoever can
<br>
discourage them. Getting the marginally more sane governments to help
<br>
stop them partially helps, but again the effects of strong threats is
<br>
also the production of strong resistance, which will come back and haunt
<br>
you later. 
<br>
<p>It is worth thinking of game theory here: you need a strategy that
<br>
promotes trust and cooperation, while discourages defection. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no way a free, individual rights afffirming, secular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government could help but piss off those countries and inviduals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of very different mindset.  Our very existence pisses them off. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no way to appease such.  We can only make clear that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when they attack us we will respond as to an act of war.  
</em><br>
<p>I have heard the term &quot;act of war&quot; bandied around so much the last days
<br>
that I fully expect that it will now lose any meaning except outside
<br>
legal circles. 
<br>
<p>The old terminology of conflict needs new words to deal with &quot;war&quot;
<br>
between nations, groups and individuals. It is not just for nations
<br>
anymore.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There is another reason for such attacks on the US, and that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; antiamericanism. It might appear absurd to many on this list, but there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are plenty of people who are deeply suspicious and prejudiced against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the US worldwide - including highly educated intellectuals. Just think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about how attacks on McDonald's in Europe has been framed not as attacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on a local franchise, but attempts to stop American cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; imperialism. Part of this is remaining cold war rhethoric that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spread far beyond the left, a bit like sticky tar that sticks to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whatever is touching it and hence spreads everywhere. Part of it is of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; course envy. Another part is the western sympathy for David versus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Goliath - the underdog is always the hero, the giant is never the hero:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; since the US is a giant, it can't be good. All these things combine to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; make prejudices against americans acceptable like no other prejudices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and biases the media - which reinforces the antiamericanism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In many ways the fact that the US has become very rich and powerful by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being a beacon of freedom is the reason so many feel it acceptable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attack it. That US foreign policy also gives them ample reason is simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the igniting spark that ignites the fuel that is already there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short we are largely hate for our good before we are hated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for any actual evil we have, may have or will commit.
</em><br>
<p>In a way, yes. The US gets distrusted because of its power, and every
<br>
single move that can be criticised or viewed as evil will be used to
<br>
support the anti-american view. So before you rush off to decisively
<br>
retailiate against an enemy, think of the long term effects.
<br>
Discouraging future attacks should be the main goal, and this depends on
<br>
1) how discouraged people get by seeing what happens to attackers, and
<br>
2) how angry people get by seeing what the US does. There is a balance
<br>
to strike here.
<br>
<p>The way to deal with the general problem is of course to deal with the
<br>
root cause. We need to make people see the good aspects of the US - by
<br>
promoting open societies, by allowing other countries to participate in
<br>
trade, open borders and so on. To a large extent this is what has worked
<br>
well for the US, but it is important to make people in general see this,
<br>
and avoid closing down trade, borders and societies out of fear of
<br>
terrorism. 
<br>
<p>There will always be opponents, rational or not, but when whole
<br>
societies embrace openness they will have a harder time getting help,
<br>
hiding and gaining converts.  No amount of military intervention can
<br>
ever achieve that to the same extent. At least not without turning the
<br>
US into exactly what people fear it might be.
