<p>You already have been, and it don't hurt so bad, does it?  You are a number 
<br>
(actually several of them: driver's license, SSN, health insurance policy 
<br>
number).  In fact every business with whom you have any sort of account 
<br>
(utilities, credit cards, mortgage, student loans) has numbered you, indexed 
<br>
you and most likely cross-referenced you with other databases in which you 
<br>
are little more than a number.
<br>
<p>People reflexively say they don't want their personal information available 
<br>
for public perusal.  The fact of the matter is that given any two of the 
<br>
following pieces of data about you, any of the others can readily be 
<br>
obtained if you know where to look and are willing to pay for it: birthdate, 
<br>
name, address, telephone number, social security number, driver's license 
<br>
number.
<br>
<p>Individuals, as much as they hate to believe it, already are about as 
<br>
transparent as they can be.  The only &quot;persons&quot; who enjoy any semblance of 
<br>
real privacy anymore are corporate and government institutions.  That is why 
<br>
transparency will be more of a benefit than a detriment to individuals.  But 
<br>
I am a patient man.  Eventually the value of transparency will make itself 
<br>
known and, although I'm not the type to say &quot;I told you so,&quot; you'll know 
<br>
I'll be thinking it ;)
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
