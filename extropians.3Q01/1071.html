Though he wasn't sure it was me, Robert quoted me saying:
<br>
<em>&gt; I realize that it's possible that that is how this reality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implemented.  At this point, I don't see any reason to lend more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; credence to that hypothesis than to the one that suggests that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's an omnipotent, omniscient being who doesn't interfere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in our affairs very often.
</em><br>
<p>and replied:
<br>
<em>&gt; You need to be much more rigorous in your thinking. If one agrees that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an &quot;omnipotent, omniscient&quot; 'being' violates known laws of physics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then it isn't even worth discussing (while we are at our current level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of development).  
</em><br>
<p>That was my point.  I haven't seen much evidence that we're living in a 
<br>
sim, and I was comparing the probabilities of different varieties of 
<br>
magical explanation.  There's a parallel conversation going on now that may 
<br>
lead to a revision of my estimate of the sim hypothesis.  Not concluded yet.
<br>
<p>He continued:
<br>
<em>&gt; What one wants to discuss are *what* are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capabilities and capacities of a full nanotech-enabled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superintelligence relative to our level of civilization such that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could appear to be quasi-omnipotent or quasi-omniscient such that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could interfere with our affairs undetectably at a high frequency. 
</em><br>
<p>I can see that this would be interesting, if we thought there might be such 
<br>
societies juxtaposed.  Are you claiming there's evidence?  Or saying that 
<br>
we should entertain it as another hypothesis with priors as good as those 
<br>
for living-in-a-sim and god-exists-but-ignores-us-mostly?
