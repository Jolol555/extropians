<p>Well, I am not sure what your references mean, but the nom de Net
<br>
comes from a Roman populist of sorts. 
<br>
<p>Re my political philosophy: it is evolving, as always.  Generally, I
<br>
think that the USA should be run more like a corporation, a business,
<br>
with us the citizens as its shareholders. I think that model yields
<br>
more for me, and my fellow citizens, or at least most of us.
<br>
<p>Businesses have many controls, such as accountants who scrutinize each
<br>
transaction, every detail of the business. Transaction controls are
<br>
built into every aspect of business. They de facto define a business,
<br>
in some ways.  So should it be in the USA, and any country.
<br>
<p>I have long been a student of zoology and espcially animal behavior,
<br>
and everywhere I see evidence of the strong victimizing the weak. In
<br>
fact, that in large part IS how the strong remain strong. We do not
<br>
seem to take this natural axiom much into account here in the USA, or
<br>
perhaps we have forgetten it. We should scrap the Constitution as it
<br>
is presently written and rewrite it to take into account the natural
<br>
axiom that in essence holds that those that have will automatically
<br>
attempt to exploit and victimize and hold back those that do not.  
<br>
<p>You call for simplicity. Why? The caves were simple.
