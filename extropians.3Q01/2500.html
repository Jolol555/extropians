<p><em>&gt; I'm not trying to force you to take responsibility for something you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not done personally.  If you live in the U.S.A., you are profiting from some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the prosperity which is still tricking down to us from slave labor (by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; institutions built by slave labor, by companies which have direct and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indirect ties to the prosperity of companies which operated on slave labor,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including stocks).
</em><br>
<p>I'm very uncertain that I am profiting,
<br>
actually.  The strongest argument that I can
<br>
think of is that the cotton picked was traded
<br>
to the northern States, and thus increased
<br>
the prosperity of the nation as a whole.
<br>
But then didn't England profit even more?
<br>
(Not sure about that, but a tremendous amount
<br>
went to the factories of Manchester.)
<br>
<p>These webs are complex indeed.  Now if I
<br>
or someone commits an aggressive act
<br>
against another person, damages can usually
<br>
be assessed.  But in cases like this?  I
<br>
have heard it argued that black people today
<br>
are much better off than they would be if
<br>
their ancestors had been left in Africa; 
<br>
after all, American blacks are substantially
<br>
better off, at least in material goods, than
<br>
are people in Africa.
<br>
<p>Quite separate from that is my belief that
<br>
institutions like slavery (even like using
<br>
and then returning labor to Mexico) hurt the
<br>
slaver too; I actually think that the American
<br>
south would have been better off *throughout*
<br>
its history if the abominable practice had 
<br>
never started.  They would have been forced
<br>
to industrialize sooner, and today would be
<br>
a healthier and better-educated people.  I
<br>
wonder if they should get reparations too;
<br>
after all, individually they are no more
<br>
responsible for slavery than you or I are.

<p><em>&gt; BTW, I would assert myself that Olga isn't trying to *blame* today's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-racist whites for the ills done by their ancestors (or even by other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less enlightened whites today) to, for example, Pat Fallon's ancestors. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe she was arguing correctly, as Nazi work camp survivors have done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively in court, that their stolen labor partly underpins the wealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of today's whites and so requires some compensation.
</em><br>
<p>The link is much, much closer if a particular citizen
<br>
(say of Germany) was seized for a few years while a
<br>
madman was in power, and his or her assets forfeited.
<br>
Those assets or a monetary equivalent can be returned.
<br>
But where would one start with American blacks?  In 
<br>
many cases, their ancestors lost some tribal conflict
<br>
and instead of being killed, were sold to slavers, who
<br>
then sold them to American southerners.  They never were
<br>
citizens (until the Emancipation Proclamation, despite
<br>
the humorous assigment of &quot;3/5 person&quot; as a political
<br>
compromise when determining the influence of states in
<br>
the union).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seems reasonable to me. But then I feel that way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in some measure, about all the underpaid labor of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the poor working stiffs throughout history--
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nearly all the ancestors of nearly all of us.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'll confess that the worst part, to me, is that
<br>
the reparations wouldn't do any good.  If you give
<br>
some rich person some money, it just gets added to
<br>
his or her investments; it doesn't affect their
<br>
life style.  And it would be true that well-educated
<br>
black people would make the most of the money they
<br>
suddenly received.  But it would merely finance
<br>
further wasteful living practices among far too
<br>
many blacks (just as sudden one-time jackpots affect
<br>
poor people everywhere).  BTW, returning tax money
<br>
is different in principle; it amounts to simply taking
<br>
less in the first place of money rightfully earned by
<br>
someone.
