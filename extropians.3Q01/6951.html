From: &quot;John Clark&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jonkc@worldnet.att.net?Subject=Re:%20Human%20lives:%20Do%20the%20math%20(was:%20Impact%20on%20history)&In-Reply-To=&lt;01b601c13fc1$6045a6e0$335c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">jonkc@worldnet.att.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Put it another way, there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence that if you're kind to terrorists terrorists will be kind to you.
</em><br>
<p>Quite true, in fact they would probably interpret kindness as weakness, and
<br>
this would encourage them to further atrocities. That's because terrorists of
<br>
the kind we're discussing are infected with the brain disease of religiosity.
<br>
So I see why you view the Prisoner's Dilemma as irrelevant here. The tit for
<br>
tat strategy doesn't take into account that these religious fanatics are
<br>
incorrigible, and require a response which diverges from the humane as much as
<br>
terrorists diverge from kindness. To phrase it differently, one cannot treat a
<br>
dog with rabies as one would treat a healthy canine companion. Cognitively,
<br>
true believers become a separate species, capable of kamikaze behavior. Tit
<br>
for tat works fine with Dr. Jekyl, but not with Mr. Hyde.
<br>
<p>Were it not for impending evolutionary phase transition, a possible long term
<br>
solution might involve a measure of separatism in which theocratic states are
<br>
sanctioned to the point of quarantine. But we probably don't have enough time
<br>
for that before an ultra-intelligent machine is evolved (or emerges
<br>
spontaneously). If UIMs enter a world of religious lunacy and decide to upload
<br>
all the lunatics to a virtual paradise (Virtopia™) or a virtual hell
<br>
(Microsoft™), depending on their beatific or masochistic preferences, that
<br>
would solve the problem once and for all. The important thing is to make sure
<br>
brain-diseased theocrats don't get the chance to subvert the emergence of
<br>
UIMs...
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
