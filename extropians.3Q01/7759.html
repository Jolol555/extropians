</em><br>
<em>&gt; extinct like the dinosaurs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Hoo boy!  How is it any vision of a future worth acheiving if we
<br>
begin by writing off over half of the human race?  Taiwan is
<br>
&quot;third world&quot;?  Hmmm.  Why don't you pull all of those third
<br>
world memory chips out of your PC and then write that again. 
<br>
India has a very thriving high tech sector despite having a lot
<br>
of poverty and superstition in her poorer population.  Singapore
<br>
is another surprise on your list. 
<br>
<p>No people &quot;need to go extinct&quot; to reach Singularity.  Some
<br>
cultures need to go extinct as they cannot adapt and will not
<br>
serve their people well as we move to Singularity.  Some
<br>
persistent memes, more of a few of them our own, need to be
<br>
replaced by much better memes. But along the way we will create
<br>
such abundance and so many levels of freedom, or rather we can,
<br>
that no peoples need go extinct.  As a matter of fact, I believe
<br>
that thinking of Singularity in terms of something we &quot;haves&quot;
<br>
hoard and develop for ourselves alone is a very sure way to make
<br>
sure it does not occur.  This is not because the &quot;have nots&quot;
<br>
will take it away from us.  It is because we will have rotted
<br>
away our chance by being too bogged down within our own
<br>
ill-serving cultural mindset - a mindset based on scarcity, fear
<br>
and &quot;getting mine&quot;.  That mindset will not allow us to move
<br>
forward well.  
<br>
<p>You can see it already.  Open information and software tools are
<br>
eseential to dealing with the masses of choices, of information
<br>
and computational needs leading to Singularity.  But the old
<br>
cultural forces wish to outlaw this abundant cornucopia and
<br>
divide all information and processing ability as if all is still
<br>
scarcity.  They would like to outlaw and choke the very means to
<br>
create and take advantage of unlimited abundance in this area. 
<br>
If it isn't scarcity then, by God, we will pass laws treating it
<br>
as if it is, wreak the economy to slow down these upstart geeks
<br>
and start-ups and start an ill-defined oppressive war to keep
<br>
this abundance stuff from making us all soft and no doubt some
<br>
fuzzy headed kind of latter day communists or cybergnostic
<br>
utopians!  
<br>
<p>I can just imagine what the repressive memes and means will look
<br>
like when we have the first Assembler.  
<br>
<p>No.  If we want to achieve a Singularity then one of the first
<br>
requirements is that we throw the shackles off our minds and our
<br>
hearts.  We create this for the betterment of all and using new
<br>
ways of thinking, being and working or we don't create it at
<br>
all.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a memetic point of view we will go a lot further if we are
</em><br>
doing this to bring as much heaven on earth as possible rather
<br>
than if we are in a mad rush to do a high-tech endrun on
<br>
humanity and leave the everyone else to die in hell.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Futurists a decade ago called this bifurcation the North South economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict  between wealthy Northern Hemisphere nations and poor,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impoverished Southern Hemisphere nations.  The East West political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict of Eastern Hemispheric Soviet (Second World) nations and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Western Hemispheric, democratic nations is the other conflict that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhat subsided at least in the classic Cold War bipolar US vs. USSR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dual superpowers scenario.   What is happening is totalitarianism is now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mixed with Islam instead of Marx (for the East West conflict) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the North South conflict of  First and Third World is more alive than ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>They are totally different pheonomenon and it is a mistake to
<br>
conflate the two.  It is also a mistake to use old scarcity
<br>
based models as means to choose a correct path forward.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Actively exterminating terrorists is essential if First World transhumans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever to make it to the 22nd century.  
</em><br>
<p><p>I utterly disagree.  Enriching the entire world would take the
<br>
wind out of some of the unrest in the world.  Stopping the
<br>
oppression my giving the people choices would ease tensions much
<br>
faster than killing off any number of terrorists and guerillas,
<br>
assuming you could find them.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; The Pentagon's Strategic Defense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Initiative (SDI) or &quot;Star Wars&quot; program is really intended to fend off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear blackmail from the Third World.  Such nuclear blackmail would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take the form of &quot;give us  your money, food, medicine, etc. for free or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we will nuke New York City&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>But, in short order if we don't fuck it up ourselves, we can
<br>
give them all of the food and medicine and material means anyone
<br>
could wish.  Not as a ransom but as the open benevolence of a
<br>
truly abundant society.  Of course, we do have a war.  We have a
<br>
major memetic war within our own minds and our own culture to
<br>
see the world as one of increasing abundance and to help this
<br>
abundance flower ever more fully.  That will be difficult.  
<br>
<p>Your nuclear scenario is simply absurd.  No third world nations
<br>
has enough missiles to do more than get us utterly ticked off
<br>
and turn their country into a burning cinder.  If terrorist
<br>
wished to use such means then they would bring the atomics in by
<br>
stealth, not in any manner an SDI would help against.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; SDI would simply counter their missiles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and kill them.  The Third World must &quot;die&quot;  by upgrading to First World
</em><br>
<em>&gt; status by going for capitalism and foreign investment like India appears to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be doing or die by the intertribal/civil war combined with the infection and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starvation that comes with unrestricted overpopulation. - William.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Capitalism based on scarcity thinking and scarcity economics is
<br>
part of the problem.  It is not the solution by itself.  The
<br>
best means of yesteryear will not suffice for the radically
<br>
different tomorrow we dream of.
