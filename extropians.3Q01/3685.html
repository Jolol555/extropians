<br>
<em>&gt; I was very disappointed in Harvey Newstrom's response to my point,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I did not bring in any additional information not referenced in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; document you posted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hah!  You *began* by complaining that the *organization* is religious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have yet to show me *anything* in that article that is religious.
</em><br>
<p>You seem to have missed my point.  The article itself invited me to review
<br>
their website for more information.  The article itself gave the references
<br>
to the other documents.  The article itself claimed that it was incomplete
<br>
due to space, and that the remainder of the information was at their site.
<br>
<p>I did not pull together unrelated information from their site to say they
<br>
were wrong about X, therefore I assume that Y is wrong.  All the materials I
<br>
looked at was claimed by them to be connected to the article, either as
<br>
supporting docs, references, methodology or some way contributing to the
<br>
document.  I did not do a Google search for unrelated views of the author to
<br>
unfairly link to this article.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is all well and good, even commendable; but I don't care whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you read so-called &quot;supporting&quot; documents from the web site or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, you *began* with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why is this stuff on the Extropians List?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The Claremont Institute is not only a conservative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization, but it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specifically a religious conservative organization.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; US was founded....
</em><br>
<p>You keep repeating this.  So what?  You asked for my conclusions of the
<br>
article.  My conclusions were that the religious institute set out to
<br>
rewrite history using prayer and God's guidance, and this article is one of
<br>
those produced by this method.  The facts determined therein seem to be from
<br>
faulty sources.  You don't have to agree with me, but you seem to be
<br>
implying that I am not allowed to point out these flaws.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Therefore, I will re-phrase Mike Lorrey's original question to you:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Why do [often] start off your denunciation of any post you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; disagree with by claiming that the website that is hosting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; information is owned by [someone of a certain stripe]?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will also ask, why don't you just begin by quoting parts of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article that offended you, and criticize them instead?  (Honestly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it does give the impression that you cannot.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you answer these two questions?
</em><br>
<p>I have already answered Mike, and I have answered you twice now.
<br>
<p>Sources of information are important.  Scientific methodology to determine
<br>
&quot;facts&quot; are important.  It is fair to point out that statistics were
<br>
specifically funded by an organization to counter more established
<br>
statistics that they don't like.  It is fair to point out that someone's
<br>
&quot;scientific&quot; method involves mystical methods or beliefs that are not
<br>
scientifically repeatable.  It is fair to point out faith-based components
<br>
that are not falsifiable or testable.
<br>
<p>It is not fair to demand that I go through and refute every single fact
<br>
without checking the sources for myself.  This is how science works.
<br>
Scientists try to replicate results by reviewing the methodology.  To ask me
<br>
to determine the validity of results without reviewing the experimental
<br>
method is unfair and time-wasting.
<br>
<p>This is really my answer.  You may disagree.  You may not like it.  But it
<br>
is an answer.  If you still think I have not answered, try rephrasing the
<br>
question.
