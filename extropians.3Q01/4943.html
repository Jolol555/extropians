<p>
These kinds of arguments scare me for what they imply more than what they
<br>
actually say.  Heston seems to want to strike up a chord with certain hate
<br>
groups without actually saying he agrees with them.  He references specific
<br>
subjects and code-words, but doesn't actually repeat the full litany.  As
<br>
such, he and his supporters take the high ground.  He can truthfully claim
<br>
that he didn't say anything bad about a specific group.  He just referenced
<br>
them without really saying anything specific.
<br>
<p>This is the exact kind of speech that is posted all over and quoted by
<br>
white-supremacists, homophobes, anti-Semites, etc.  They all &quot;know&quot; what he
<br>
is talking about, but it is hard to prove that he said anything.  It is the
<br>
exact vague speech that Clinton uses to describe his sexual activities, or
<br>
that drug dealers and prostitutes use to negotiate a deal.  They know they
<br>
can't say what they mean, so they talk around an issue.  If they get caught,
<br>
they will insist that they didn't really say anything.
<br>
<p>When he says his Creator gave him a gift which might be used in the
<br>
political process, he implies that God will guide him to run for president
<br>
and guide his decisions while he is president.
<br>
<p>When he says we are fighting a great civil war and cultural war that is
<br>
trying to hijack our birthright, he is implying that he wants to turn back
<br>
history to earlier political times and have rights based on birth.
<br>
<p>When he says that he that our problems are bigger than the gun issue, he
<br>
implies that the gun issue is at its core.
<br>
<p>When he says that white pride is not racist, he implies that he is
<br>
supporting white pride groups without mentioning any support for other
<br>
races.
<br>
<p>When he says that gay rights should extend no further than &quot;my&quot; rights or
<br>
&quot;your&quot; rights, he implies that gays are fighting for unfair rights not equal
<br>
rights.  He also implies that gays are not part of &quot;us/me/you&quot; but some
<br>
other group.
<br>
<p>When he spoke against the Axis Powers in World War II, and draws a parallel
<br>
between the holocaust and what is currently happening to gun owners, he
<br>
implies the holocaust was less than it was or that gun control equals Nazi
<br>
atrocities.
<br>
<p>When he gives an example of dental patients who got AIDS from dentists who
<br>
didn't disclose it, he implies that AIDS patients must be publicly disclosed
<br>
and kept away from the general public.
<br>
<p>When he points out that Dr. King said &quot;negroes&quot; but its not allowed now, he
<br>
implies that we should be allowed classify people into another race by the
<br>
color of their skin.
<br>
<p>When he claims to be a Native American because he was blood-initiated into a
<br>
tribe, he implies that we should discount any racism that native Americans
<br>
see because he is one and doesn't see any discrimination.
<br>
<p>When he says one can talk about race without being a racist, he implies that
<br>
he wants to talk about race and make decisions based on race.
<br>
<p>When he says that one can see distinctions between genders without being
<br>
sexist, it implies that he wants to observe differences between genders and
<br>
probably make decisions based on gender.
<br>
<p>When he says you can think critically about a denomination without being
<br>
anti-religion, it implies that he wants to criticize specific religions for
<br>
their beliefs without criticizing others.
<br>
<p>When he says you can accept but not celebrate homosexuality without being a
<br>
homophobe, he implies that we can accept that it exists but we don't have to
<br>
like it or even cooperate with it.
<br>
<p>When he says disobedience is in our DNA and follows the awesome power of
<br>
Gandhi, Thoreau, and Jesus, he implies a racial rights and manifest destiny
<br>
for certain groups.
<br>
<p>When he argues for the right to discuss race, guns, religion and
<br>
conservatism, but then argues against the right to discuss liberalism on
<br>
campus, anti-authority in entertainment, or political correctness in
<br>
entertainment, he implies that free-speech is more for some ideas than
<br>
others.
<br>
<p>Heston seems to be gathering support for some political agenda to address
<br>
&quot;negroes&quot;, &quot;homosexuals&quot;, &quot;feminists&quot;, &quot;anti-authority musicians&quot;,
<br>
&quot;politically correct entertainers&quot;, &quot;liberal teachers&quot;, &quot;AIDS-infected
<br>
people&quot;, etc.  He wants to recognize differences based on race, gender,
<br>
orientation, religion and political beliefs.  The fact that he doesn't
<br>
specify what he wants to do with these groups or how they should be treated
<br>
differently does not diminish the fact that he seems to be singling out
<br>
specific groups for different treatment in some unspecified way.
<br>
<p>Even though I can't prove that his plans for these groups are bad, the very
<br>
fact that he is publicly compiling a list of groups ominous.  He is drawing
<br>
the lines between &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot;.  We can only guess what the next step
<br>
will be.
