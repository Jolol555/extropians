As I mentioned in another message a moment ago, I've been able to devote
<br>
very little time to correspondence of any kind in the weeks since Extro5, so
<br>
I've only been skimming the list very quickly.  It was with some
<br>
considerable unhappiness that I read about the very unfriendly message &quot;LB&quot;
<br>
received regarding her posts to the list.  For the record, I fully endorse
<br>
E.Shaun's message (quoted below in its entirety for the record and for the
<br>
cc to LB I send with this post -- my own brief comments follow):

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Congratulations to those of you who just chased another person off of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians list.  Perhaps, if you're lucky, we'll wind up with only a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dozen with exact same ideas on everything.  That would be wonderful,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Frankly, I'm tired of seeing this happen.  True, it isn't often as
</em><br>
explicit
<br>
<em>&gt; as this case, but I have been privy to seeing plenty of unsubscriptions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after unnecessary verbal attacks.  And why is it...just because someone
</em><br>
has
<br>
<em>&gt; a few disagreements with one aspect of your worldview?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I have an opinion on virtually every thread on this list, but
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; try not to share those opinions unless I feel they add something to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion as a whole --usually they do not.  Unfortunately, I don't have
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; lot of workable ideas on changing the format of this list, or solutions to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out and out rudeness.  I will mention, like many before me however, that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find such behavior juvenile, unwarranted and disgusting, and most of all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unnecessary.  This isn't the kind of behavior that will win us credibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a public scale.  Please keep that in mind before you start posting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vehemence.
</em><br>
<p>After my talk at Extro5, my own strong views on the role of &quot;religion&quot; in
<br>
history and culture cannot be a mystery.  However, I think it is very
<br>
important to note two things.  First, this is an open list and we welcome
<br>
courteous discussion of extropian ideas, values and goals from all
<br>
viewpoints.  &quot;Courteous&quot; means that those who may have some disagreement
<br>
with the core ideas of transhumanism and extropianism or who wish to
<br>
question such things should express any such disagreement or inquiry in a
<br>
thoughtful, well-informed way and with respect for those who have populated
<br>
this list for longer than they have.  I have seen nothing to indicate that
<br>
LB did anything but comply with such a standard of conduct.  Accordingly, I
<br>
want to make it clear that any kind of off-list harassment of LB or any
<br>
other subscriber who observes these rules of etiquette is unwarranted and is
<br>
condemned by me personally and Extropy Institute, the list sponsor, as well.
<br>
<p>Second, I offer some VERY brief thoughts on the subject of &quot;religion&quot; and
<br>
&quot;spirituality&quot;.  I am a philosophical &quot;materialist&quot; and personally reject
<br>
the notion of &quot;supernatural&quot; influences in the world.  However, this does
<br>
not mean that I find nothing of value in the long cultural traditions of
<br>
&quot;religion&quot; or the rather vague set of ideas and values that often go under
<br>
the rubric of &quot;spirituality&quot;.  In fact, I have devoted a good deal of study
<br>
to both of these subjects and continue to do so.  Someone (sorry, can't
<br>
recall who now -- perhaps it was LB herself in the thread that seems to have
<br>
prompted the rude message she received) noted that there are undertones of
<br>
&quot;mysticism&quot; or some such term in the transhumanist and extropian programs.
<br>
I understand this view and, in some important ways, feel it is true.
<br>
Looking forward to transcending the current human condition and valuing a
<br>
continuing pursuit of perfection and expansion of consciousness into the
<br>
universe is deeply resonant with many of the best &quot;religious&quot; and
<br>
&quot;spiritual&quot; goals and values one finds both in history and in the current
<br>
expression of those latter notions in the many varieties of human culture.
<br>
I have written about this myself, both in my musings on &quot;the ethics of
<br>
godhood&quot; and in other contexts.  I think we would ignore this fact to our
<br>
peril.
<br>
<p>LB, you are welcome on the list.
