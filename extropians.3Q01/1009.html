I had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Why not?  Yes, if people are going to entertain false beliefs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'd of course prefer that they do it in solitude.  But it still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has to be stated that not only is what they believe false, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that there is something very wrong with how they think. 
</em><br>
<p>and Samantha responded, in part
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can't believe what I am reading.  You have enough knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and information to form an opinion.  You do not have enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge and information to be dead certain that all those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have religious/spiritual beliefs are believing falsehoods and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;there is something wrong with how they think&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Evidently she's not alone in thinking that someone my sentence
<br>
is to be read as claiming that &quot;all those who have religious/
<br>
spiritual beliefs are believing falsehoods and there is
<br>
something wrong with how they think.&quot;
<br>
<p>How do people possibly misread what I wrote?  J.R. and I were
<br>
primarily analyzing how *all sorts* of people have various
<br>
beliefs.  Why, by &quot;false belief&quot; I definitely meant a belief
<br>
regarded as false by EVERYONE on this list!  Such beliefs
<br>
exist, you know!
<br>
<p>So let me go on record as saying that I don't think that there
<br>
is anything wrong with how any of the people on this list think.
<br>
<p>Lee
