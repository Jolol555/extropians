<p><em>&gt;  &lt;&gt; Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a distinct lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality in the conception of the foreign policy of the United States.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with China slowly but surely abandoning its communist ideological position
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward its own people and the world, there has not been a basis for a clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral contrast between the values of liberty, opnness and tolerance upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which the civilization of the West is premised, and the civilizations with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which it competes for influence in the world.  Last night, an unmistakable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; line was drawn between things that are good and right and things that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evil.  Although it was done in a distinctly American way in a distinctly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American voice, the call went out to the world to make a clear-cut choice.
</em><br>
<p>I wish I could agree, but it seems to me that in many ways the U.S. is
<br>
increasing its commitment to immoral actions in foreign policy.
<br>
<p>The most obvious is the proposal to remove 1970's era restrictions on the
<br>
CIA which prevent them from using criminals as operatives.  VP Cheney
<br>
and several others have said that we can no longer afford the luxury
<br>
of working only with people who are honest and peacable.  In order to
<br>
infiltrate thugs and murderers, we are going to hire thugs and murderers.
<br>
<p>Those 1970s limitations were put into place after decades of abusive
<br>
behavior by the CIA.  US sponsored thugs commited terrible acts which
<br>
continue to hurt the American image overseas.  We are opening the door to
<br>
returning to that pattern of behavior.  It is very questionable whether
<br>
this will advance the long-term interests of the US.
<br>
<p>Another moral issue is our continued support for repressive governments
<br>
in Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.  President Bush singled out those
<br>
three countries in his speech last night, I believe.  These are our
<br>
&quot;friends&quot; among the Arabs.  But they are among the most authoritarian
<br>
regimes in the region.
<br>
<p>Likewise we are backing away from criticism of Russia over its actions
<br>
in Chechnya, we are supporting the Pakistani strongman who currently
<br>
runs the country, and we are undoubtedly going to mute our criticism of
<br>
Chinese human rights violations as we look for support from the East.
<br>
All of these are countries where the US previously took a strong moral
<br>
stance of disapproval.  But in a war we can't afford to antagonize those
<br>
whom we hope to keep as allies.
<br>
<p>In short it looks to me like the pressures of war are forcing us to
<br>
take a number of moral shortcuts.  The point of morality, I believe,
<br>
is to provide a set of heuristics that will tend to advance long-term
<br>
interests over short-term expediencies.  We seem to be moving in exactly
<br>
the opposite direction as we gear up for the coming fight.
<br>
