</em><br>
<p>You'd ascribe a libertarian streak to David &quot;more liberal than thou&quot; Brin? 
<br>
Yeesh! (Mind you, I've heard him talk a few times. Unless he's had a 180-
<br>
degree conversion he is _no_ libertarian.) As for Greg Bear, he's no 
<br>
libertarian either. Small-c conservative, maybe, but again, unless he's
<br>
drifted radically out of where he used to be there's no way I can see of
<br>
calling him a libertarian.
<br>
<p>(Are you going to try and tell me that Ken McLeod is an objectivist? ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So my question remains. Why does the extrolist show the same mentality as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one sub-set of sf fandom, whereas the sf-related lists I've been on have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shown a totally different mentality?
</em><br>
<p>I suspect it goes back to the seed effect of the extropian principles, Max
<br>
More's original declaration, and group-think within the original extropian
<br>
cadre -- who are, to be fair, Americans and largely drawn from (a) hard-SF
<br>
readers and (b) the technology venture culture of Northern California.
<br>
<p>There's also the American frontier tradition -- the idea that there exists
<br>
a frontier where daring individuals can go and stake their claim and
<br>
pioneer something huge, big, wild and free, far from the petty red-tape
<br>
imposed by bickering bad-tempered neighbours. In the extropian mythos,
<br>
this is transposed into a radiant future worthy of Zinoviev (only stripped
<br>
of the Marxist elements) where those who embrace it first become the
<br>
elders of the party -- er, culture. (Nope, no party here folks; we aren't
<br>
techno-Leninists, that isn't an historical dialectic, we have no intention
<br>
of steering or leading the masses, and that isn't a gun in my pocket.)
<br>
<p>As for the singularity, calling it the Rapture of the Nerds is cruel but
<br>
psychologically accurate given the way some people engage with the concept.
<br>
<p>I hope you'll excuse me: I'm just feeling a little bitter and twisted this
<br>
morning.
