&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok lets take a look at........
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Moreover, intelligence, contrary to JR's assumption, is not the be-all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and end-all of sentience, though it is a part.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah i'd completely agree with this statement, intelligence IMHO must
<br>
be about more than just raw processing power capacity. But i also have
<br>
to say i'd expect any half thoughtful person thinking about the concept to
<br>
come to the same conclusion.
<br>
But i really wouldn't like to try and nail down exactly what would be required,
<br>
all would say is that at some point i expect manufactured devices to exist
<br>
that ppl will generally accept as intelligent. I don't ever expect AI to 
<br>
think like
<br>
a human does. Am kind of baffled by anyone who does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Creativity, for example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the ability to make the value judgements that filter 'good'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creativity from 'bad' creativity, are a hallmark of human sentience.
</em><br>
<p>Woaaaaaaa  this IMHO is an issue that human society has wrestled with
<br>
since before the invention of the wheel. Am certain the poor hominid who
<br>
first realized that s/he could use fire caused a huge debate amongst the
<br>
tribe about how &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; this new thing was.
<br>
And we are still in practical terms no nearer to a value judgement free
<br>
way to analyze such concepts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When a computer can look at another sentients work and say &quot;That
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is/isn't art&quot;, with some rational explaination for it, as well as create
</em><br>
<em>&gt;art that a) is not derivative, and b) critics can say IS definitely art,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then I'll accept that AI computer as sentient.
</em><br>
<p>You asking for a lot there. Since most Artists and critics cannot do this,
<br>
with any level of common agreement, and most of the really clever ones
<br>
with a modernist or post-modernist perspective wouldn't even try to.
<br>
Art abandoned the idea of is-Art is-not-Art a long time ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It cannot do so without values.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmmmmm all depends what you mean by values, i have to admit that i
<br>
feel somewhat uncomfortable with the use of ill defined human concepts like
<br>
values and intelligence, i regard to AI's. We aren't really sure what we mean
<br>
when we use these terms to describe our own behavior. And i am dubious
<br>
if these concepts could have real meaning when describing &quot;other&quot; forms
<br>
of intelligence.
<br>
<p>Of course i realize we don't really have any other terms to use if we want to
<br>
discuss these issues.
<br>
<p>As i said earlier IMHO it's madness to ever expect a manufactured device or a
<br>
chunk of Brain tissue isolated from a normal human body to think like a person.
<br>
Thats not however to say that something cannot be intelligent without
<br>
replicating human modes of thought.
<br>
<p>One of the most exciting AI fantasies of mine is the chance to converse 
<br>
with something
<br>
that thinks unlike i do. Maybe one day it'll be possible.
