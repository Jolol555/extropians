<em>&gt; But a social system isn't (just) a 'system of rules'. It also has beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and various cause-effect and dependency issues related to environment and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biology that cause Godel's to be inapplicable. The fact that it consists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of anything(!) more than a system of rules is enough to invalidate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Godel's. Godel's simply isn't applicable to a broad enough set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples. Though Godel's may keep you from proving it).
</em><br>
<p>Pardon my ignorance, but I would like to know, in a clear, consise language, about the above examples that can constitute &quot;more than a set ot rules&quot;.
<br>
<p>Think of it: Does the laws of science really exist in the real world, or do they exist only in our heads? Put it in another manner: Do you really see this eco-system diagram when we make a stroll in the woods? Do you see mathematical equations spouting out of your car engines?
<br>
<p>Notes: More details explaining this and more on Godel's Theorem in another (now half-completed) non-political posting.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The reality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the concept of 'social system' is entirely too broad for the conept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 'self-consistent language' to be applied. Where did the requirement for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'consistency' in a social setting come from in the first place? And what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does 'consistency' actually mean in that context?
</em><br>
<p>Godel's Theorem applies to all systems, including illogical (as in inconsistent) ones, except itself (so it has incompleteness too). If you insist, I hope you can show me some examples.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; A naive interpretation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be that they always make decisions the same way or perhaps the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection. Either will fail because it won't respond to changes in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment. Clearly in conflict with the premise of being 'consistent'.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, for a same set of situation with perfect information, a rational person will always choose the best choice (if it exists). (Now, I know we don't get perfect information easily, but I shall handle this seperate issue in another post, or in the paper itself, not here.) However, I don't quite understand how always choosing the best choice has anything to do with inconsistency?
<br>
<p>You may call a simplified assumption naive, but then, a lot of other people start with &quot;naive&quot; assumptions that eventually make full-blown theories. Einstein, for example, had this assumption that light travels at a constant speed no matter at what speed you observe it, and this definitely seems &quot;naive&quot; also because it has goes against &quot;common sense&quot;.
