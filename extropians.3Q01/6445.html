[sigh] I just know I shouldn't reply to this... I have work to do...

</em><br>
<em>&gt;seems so alien or dare I use the word &quot;radical&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Ideas that matter more than people are not worth holding. Philosophies that 
<br>
let you consider people en-masse and minimise their humanity lead to 
<br>
atrocities. The destruction of the poor souls at the WTC shows that clearly.
<br>
<p>I don't have convictions in the normal sense.
<br>
For me, life is valued above all else, next most important to me is 
<br>
intelligence, and the third thing I hold dear is knowledge.
<br>
<p>I start from these simply because it seems to me the most logical thing to 
<br>
do. I don't believe in moral absolutes. I see punishment as sometimes 
<br>
&quot;working&quot;, but other times counterproductive. Everything is evaluated in my 
<br>
eyes by how it can enhance life, intelligence, and knowledge. Calling for 
<br>
senseless revenge pretty clearly runs counter to all three. I won't repeat 
<br>
the reasons. [sigh]
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;This isn't at all what history has shown. Where were all the terrorist from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Japan, Germany, or Korea? Historical precedence says that when a country is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beaten down, for the most part, they shut up.
</em><br>
<p>True, but you are wanting to fight a totally different beast here. This is 
<br>
no simple, centralised monster. This something that if you lop off one head 
<br>
many more spring up to take its place. A different tactic is called for. 
<br>
This is more like the war with Vietnam.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Damn strait I'm a fanatic for liberty and proud of it. Ill fight to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;death to preserve it as well, for myself and my children.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately it looks like you will just be guaranteeing that your 
<br>
children will have to deal with the fallout from your desire for simple 
<br>
revenge.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I'm sure everyone here that's spouting against violence feels morally smug
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking there's never a time for violence.
</em><br>
<p>Of course there is a time for violence. But it is just not *always* 
<br>
productive, and certainly shouldn't be the standard kneejerk response.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I for one think that people that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't have the strength to define a philosophy and defend it are moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cowards. I for one don't agree with the philosophy of the middle east, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at least they have the balls to have one. There is no way that man can exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without an integrated world view... a philosophy. This moral agnosticism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worse by far though. At least their view has a relationship to reality...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their wrong. The fog of the unknowable ether inhabited by the anti-idealist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has no relationship to anything. Its free to twist, contort, and dispense
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with its views at whim. The misguided Arabs will eventually have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possibility to correct their thinking by correlating it with reality, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be no such chance for the anti-idealist.
</em><br>
<p>Oh great. Calling for thoughtful, measured response that takes into account 
<br>
past and future actions makes me more reprehensible than the dumb shits who 
<br>
altered your skyline so dramatically by succumbing to the illusion of quick 
<br>
fix via violence. :-(
<br>
<p>Jerry, it feels strange to hear you aligning yourself with the fanatics 
<br>
while denouncing someone who would like to find long-term solutions to this 
<br>
cycle of spilt blood.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
