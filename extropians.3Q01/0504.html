<p>I recently opted for poverty in order to extend myself. I quit my job to 
<br>
try and get on with a peculiar passion of mine. I am trying to create a 
<br>
story inside a virtual world. I don't think anyone would pay me to do that, 
<br>
and even if they would I wouldn't be happy about accepting money for it 
<br>
because I am still not 100% sure current technology is quite up to it yet. 
<br>
So I am happy to live on next to nothing, pursue my dream, and owe nobody.
<br>
<p>I have noticed that I either earn money OR have the time to do the things I 
<br>
want -- never both. So I have decided for the latter and carry on the fine 
<br>
tradition of the starving artist.  :-)
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
