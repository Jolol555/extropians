<p>I don't expect that anything I say will affect you Mike, but here goes...
<br>
<p>I have a friend from the Phillipines. She told me about how things worked 
<br>
over there. It is slightly less of a problem now, but much of it still stands.
<br>
<p>The extremely rich have their own private armies. Most of the poor have 
<br>
absolutely no chance of getting out of poverty to become more useful 
<br>
members of society; they are born into slavery and will spend their lives 
<br>
that way. There were no controls upon the rich and powerful... there still 
<br>
are few.
<br>
<p>Again with the disclaimer: I don't think capitalism is bad. I think 
<br>
excessive power too often leads to abuse of that power. One natural 
<br>
outgrowth of capitalism is concentration of power into fewer and fewer 
<br>
hands... just like most political systems. Use of capitalism as a 
<br>
substitute religion encourages uncritical acceptance of such a fate.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
