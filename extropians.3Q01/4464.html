<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I firmly believe that science
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is nothing more than ordinary reasoning and common sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;methodically applied to certain areas of inquiry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ah, then you might read Alan Cromer's UNCOMMON SENSE for another opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He develops a Piagetian analysis of why science is really quite difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and massively counter-intuitive. Plainly we mostly approach the world on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the basis of evolved dispositional templates that, in conjunction with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cultural memory, create our *folk physics* and *folk psychology*, etc: the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;usual ways humans tend to negotiate our *Lebenswelt*. One element of folk
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physics or plain common sense gives us the wrong answer if we ask so simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a question as which bullet falls to the ground first, one dropped straight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;down or one fired horizontally above a level plain at 1 km/hr. (Luckily,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;folk physics assumes that the earth is flat.)
</em><br>
<p>I think you're both right but are using the expression &quot;common sense&quot;
<br>
differently, or emphasising different aspects of it.
<br>
<p>Take the classic case of Galileo, who overturned the &quot;common sense&quot; of his
<br>
time but through reasoning that was nonetheless &quot;commonsensical&quot; in the way
<br>
that I think Lee means.
<br>
<p>How to resolve this seeming paradox? Well, some shared concepts and
<br>
experiences must be appealed to even when attempts are made to overturn what
<br>
a culture views as commonsense truths. Otherwise, the argument can gain no
<br>
imaginative grip on its audience. Rational inquiry proceeds piecemeal and is
<br>
heavily dependent upon mutually intelligible examples, analogies and
<br>
metaphors. In explaining the new, reference is made to the known. There is
<br>
no method used by science that is discontinuous with other methods used in
<br>
the process of rational inquiry. Yet a society's &quot;common sense&quot; beliefs
<br>
about the world can, indeed, be overthrown by scientific inquiries and
<br>
arguments.
<br>
<p>In _The Copernican Revolution_, Thomas Kuhn (whom I'm not normally a huge
<br>
fan of) says, &quot;The idea that the earth moves seems initially absurd.&quot; He
<br>
then elaborates:
<br>
<p>&quot;Our senses tell us all we know of motion, and they indicate no motion for
<br>
the earth. Until it is reeducated, common sense tells us that, if the earth
<br>
is in motion, then the air, clouds, birds, and other objects not attached to
<br>
the earth must be left behind. A man jumping would descend to earth far from
<br>
the point where his leap began, for the earth would move beneath him while
<br>
he was in the air. Rocks and trees, cows and men must be hurled from a
<br>
rotating earth as a stone flies from a rotating sling. Since none of these
<br>
effects is seen, the earth is at rest. Observation and reason have combined
<br>
to prove it.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the early 17th century, however, Galileo challenged this &quot;commonsense&quot;
<br>
view, drawing on a mix of empirical observations and ingenious arguments
<br>
that used examples and analogies which his contemporaries understood.
<br>
<p>Alan Chalmers (_What is this thing Called Science_?) and Philip Kitcher
<br>
(_The Advancement of Science_) have given both given detailed explanations
<br>
of how Galileo was able to convince opponents that telescopic observations
<br>
of the heavens were reliable, even though he lacked an adequate theory of
<br>
optics.  For example, he supplemented the telescope with an attached device
<br>
that enabled relatively precise observations of the movements of the
<br>
apparent &quot;starlets&quot; around Jupiter. The motions and the apparent
<br>
disappearances behind Jupiter or in front of it or into its shadow did not
<br>
appear to be an illusion caused by the telescope. Moreover, why should such
<br>
an illusion appear near Jupiter and nowhere else?
<br>
<p>Kitcher describes how Galileo was able to check the reliability of the
<br>
telescope on earth, to train others, to demonstrate how the device worked
<br>
systematically, and to exploit overlaps in the results of naked eye and
<br>
telescopic observations. Galileo was able to subject his observations to
<br>
practical tests that could be conducted by others, including the prediction
<br>
of further positions of Jupiter's moons and their transits and eclipses. In
<br>
dealing with apparent planetary sizes, which were inconsistent with all the
<br>
astronomical theories of the time, he introduced the hypothesis of
<br>
irradiation but was able to offer arguments for this that did not depend
<br>
upon circular reasoning presupposing his own ideas. For example, he appealed
<br>
to evidence about terrestrial phenomena such as torches glowing at night,
<br>
which seem larger than they are.
<br>
<p>Galileo, then, was able to draw upon knowledge and experience that was
<br>
available within his culture in order to demonstrate the general reliability
<br>
of telescopic observations. His arguments were of a familiar kind that was
<br>
continuous with commonsense methods of inquiries understood by his
<br>
contemporaries, and it is notable how easily his contemporaries were
<br>
convinced by, for example, the discovery of the moons of Jupiter. But the
<br>
arguments then provided, in turn, new empirical knowledge sufficiently
<br>
compelling to stand as premises in arguments directed at some of his
<br>
culture's commonsense beliefs.
<br>
<p>To the argument that an object dropped from a tower must fall &quot;behind&quot; the
<br>
tower if the earth rotates, Galileo replied with the example of an object
<br>
dropped from the mast of a moving ship. For a sea-faring culture, this
<br>
analogy had an imaginative grip that it would not have had in some other
<br>
cultures. Indeed, Galileo's arguments in general would have made no sense to
<br>
a culture unacquainted with the various phenomena to which he appealed as
<br>
examples and analogies. In that sense, his ideas, discoveries and arguments
<br>
were culturally constrained and had to be continuous with other arguments,
<br>
&quot;knowledge&quot; etc in his culutre. This applies to all scientists, scholars and
<br>
thinkers, but it entails neither truth-relativism nor that we should be
<br>
pessimistic about overturning substantive &quot;common sense&quot; beliefs by rational
<br>
inquiry and argument that people around us can understand if we lead them
<br>
through it. After all, the earth does move.
<br>
<p>I don't think we can limit in advance the kinds of arguments that can be
<br>
made by scientists and philosophers, thought there will always be *some*
<br>
limits as to what arguments can be run in particular societies. However,
<br>
there is no single &quot;method&quot;, merely the use of various kinds of empirical
<br>
observation, reasoning, the ratcheting up of what empirical observations are
<br>
possible as new, reliable instruments are invented, etc. I take it this is
<br>
the sort of thing that Lee means by &quot;common sense&quot; modes of reasoning.
<br>
Scientific inquiry is continuous with any other form of rational inquiry - I
<br>
think that is Lee's point. To attack science and its methods it is to attack
<br>
rational inquiry itself - which is used in the law, in medicine and lots of
<br>
other places apart from formal science, as Lee says. OTOH, as Damien says,
<br>
this process can and often will end up subverting common beliefs that are
<br>
considered &quot;common sense&quot; in a particular society.
