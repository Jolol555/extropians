<em>&gt; Sorry. You just hit a hot-button of mine. You are *supposed* to be an

<em>&gt; What the hell kind of optimism is it that goes on about &quot;rebuilding the

<em>&gt; What _I_ want to do is to convert those religious fanatics to extropian

</em><br>
<p>I'd like to convert psychopathic murdurers into peaceful loving citizens
<br>
too. How possible do you think it is going to happen while they are
<br>
killing you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; It might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; seem ridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and the West, he's got a billion soldiers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ridiculous! Muslims are ready to hand him over now, if the US asks for his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wretched ass.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's ridiculous, but it's what he believes. Do you really think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just because Hitler's beliefs were ridiculous, he didn't believe in them?
</em><br>
<p>Hitler thought he could win WWII, yet analyses of the logistics of any
<br>
one of the three ally countries shows that each of them could have
<br>
beaten Germany on their own with enough time. Hirohito attacked the US
<br>
knowing that it would lead to Japan's defeat, yet Tojo was convinced
<br>
that they could win. 
<br>
<p>Should we have refused to fight just because Hitler and Tojo were
<br>
convinced they would win?
<br>
<p>Do you think it is possible to convert bin Laden and his followers and
<br>
associates into happy extropes? I don't. I think we need to make the
<br>
world safe for extropy by weeding out the rabid entropic dogs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; He's probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; wrong, in the end the west would win, whatever that would mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;probably&quot; wrong? Tamim Ansary: the new world's champion of understatement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, the west (spell that N - A - T - O) will definitely win, and it will mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that we've proven that religious fanatics should all go to the imaginary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; paradise that they so fervently believe in -- we're here to help.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Er, you may have forgotten that Germany has a muslim population of seven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million. The UK has a muslim population of three million. France is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere in-between. The US muslim population is a smaller per-capita
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proportion, but similarly measured in the millions.
</em><br>
<p>The US muslim population is also 7 million. A little more than the
<br>
Jewish population.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the goal is to kick the Taliban in the nuts, take their territory away,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and rebuild Afghanistan, most muslims in the west won't cheer, but they'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nod thoughtfully and go along with it. (The Taliban are to the islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world about where Adolf Hitler would stand in relation to the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Republican party.)
</em><br>
<p>On opposite ends of the spectrum?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if it turns into a crusade -- literally, a holy war for the cross,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against islam, which is what Jerry Fallwell wants -- then what the west
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will have will not be a mere &quot;terrorist problem&quot;; it'll be all-out civil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war at home.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt that anybody beyond the typical hicks that follow Fallwell buys
<br>
into that sort of thing. His own people have already made him retract
<br>
his statements.
