<p>Well, if it's really that extreme, I'll just download the patch from
<br>
LinOWIPA that tricks Zirkoniums into thinking everything's signed.
<br>
Illegal?  Hell, yeah!  Detectable from the outside?  Hell, no!  Even
<br>
under this, you've gotta have probable cause to search my house or
<br>
office and unveil the true nature of the equipment...and before *that*,
<br>
you've gotta have some reason to even notice me out of the crowd of
<br>
sheeple.  Heck, if there's enough interest, the patch might even get
<br>
good enough at emulating Windows IP that even the user is
<br>
fooled...except maybe they'll notice the copy-protection thingie is
<br>
busted, and not stopping copies.  IS says they'll look at it if the
<br>
user complains at all (and, honestly, not many people complain about
<br>
seemingly free bonus functionality), and puts it at the bottom of their
<br>
list whether or not they know what they're running.
<br>
<p>Note that basically this scheme is already de facto for DVD players
<br>
outside the US, though mitigated by the commercial availablity of
<br>
region-settable players.  (And inside the US, for DVD players owned by
<br>
those few who want titles not available region coded for the US.)
