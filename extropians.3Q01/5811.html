<p>&lt;&lt;I can't talk about the other parts with any authority, but as I live
<br>
in Scotland here's my take on the situation. Remember to correct for
<br>
whatever you perceive as being my ideological bias! Especially bear
<br>
in mind that I'm not Scottish -- I'm an incomer, from Yorkshire (with
<br>
ancestors who got out of Poland one jump ahead of a pogrom).&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Thank you very much Charlie.  You tossed off more than enough
<br>
politics for me to google my way to a more profound level of
<br>
confusion on the SNP.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would anyone else care to dispel my ignorance visavis Quebec
<br>
and WestCanada?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has it to do with extropy?  Well my dinner conversation
<br>
revolved more around the form southern conservatism's political
<br>
pull on the country might take in the next 15 years. If you think
<br>
stem cell cuts and cloning bans are aweful (as I do) just imagine
<br>
what sort of political pressure a Bible Belt would put on Washington
<br>
if they saw Bush's immigration policy as the last straw to break
<br>
with Republicans.  Especially in a more &quot;dynamic&quot; geopolitical
<br>
North America.  Ah well...time to go to class.
<br>
<p>regards,
<br>
Brian
