I can't resist joining in the discussion about health care - maybe because I
<br>
am busy with it about 12 hours/day, leaving too little time for the
<br>
extropian thing. 
<br>
<p>Miriam quoted:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think the biggest difference between the socialized health care system
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt;the US health care system is that people in the US see a bill that is
</em><br>
closer
<br>
<em>&gt;to the real cost

<p>True, and that is cool if you can afford it. If not then just die. :-)
<br>
<p>Health is too important. Too many other businesses rely upon people's 
<br>
health, not to mention all the people who rely upon their health.  :-)
<br>
<p>By all means gamble with washing powder, telephone systems, car tyres... 
<br>
but not people's lives.
<br>
<p>#### There is a very important moral issue involved in paying for medical
<br>
care with tax-derived funds - namely, isn't it morally wrong to take money
<br>
under duress, (the IRS), ultimately backed by a threat of death, to pay for
<br>
other persons' life-saving procedures?
<br>
<p>I would say it depends.
<br>
<p>There are some people who just don't care much about their health - they
<br>
smoke, drive drunk, blow their cortical vessels with cocaine, and then come
<br>
to depend on public largesse for treatment and other support, without ever
<br>
paying a dime into the pool of insurance money. I would have no compunction
<br>
about letting them rely on private charity for their needs.
<br>
<p>But then, there are other people, those who you are probably thinking about
<br>
- the nice, hard-working, regular folks, who sincerely want to pay but just
<br>
happen to make too little money for full insurance, after paying for food,
<br>
rent, utilities, kids' college fund. I am willing to help them, to some
<br>
extent, and to support the use of governmental oppression to force other
<br>
citizens to help, too.
<br>
<p>How would you know that somebody is nice and honestly willing to pay their
<br>
health bills? And, another important element, not all persons have the same
<br>
needs - there are people willing to spend their last dime on nutritional
<br>
supplements and the best medicine there is. Others, having 10 000$ to spend,
<br>
might allocate only a few hundred dollars for health, and prefer to spend
<br>
the rest on a Caribbean cruise.
<br>
<p>I think that a workable and fair system would offer tiered,
<br>
government-standardized but privately run insurance plans to all citizens.
<br>
Every participant would have to pay a premium. If you define a person's
<br>
disposable income (DI) as the difference between the actual income (I) and
<br>
basic life-support needs, LSN, (1500-2500 kcal/day of the cheapest,
<br>
reasonably non-toxic food, + rent for 30 sq.ft of living space, a set amount
<br>
for clothing, etc.), then the premium for the top-tier health plan would be
<br>
the lower of the following numbers:
<br>
<p>P=DI=I - ISN 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or
<br>
P=actuarial cost of insurance
<br>
<p>For the plan offering for example 60% of the top coverage, the premium would
<br>
be:
<br>
<p>P%= DI x 0.6
<br>
<p>And so on.
<br>
<p>The difference between the actuarial, free-market cost of insurance, and the
<br>
premiums paid, would be covered by tax money. The system would encourage
<br>
diligent shopping for the best plan at the lowest cost, because the
<br>
customers would be paying a lot of their own money, in terms of percentage
<br>
of their disposable income. However, nobody would be denied care because of
<br>
the inability to pay.
<br>
<p>Thus, even the poorest, but very health conscious person could afford the
<br>
best medicine. Those who would want to spend some of their disposable income
<br>
on, let's say, lipstick, would pay only a percentage of the DI, and receive
<br>
less care, assuming the full personal responsibility for their choices.
<br>
<p>Nobody would get hurt, except by their own nonchalance, and nobody would get
<br>
a free ride either.
