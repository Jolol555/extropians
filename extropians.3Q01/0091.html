I suspect that many of us are missing the point in evaluating this movie.
<br>
We are looking at it from an Extropian perspective, but that is not how
<br>
it was intended to be seen.
<br>
<p>The movie is certainly not meant as a case study, a cautionary tale
<br>
about how not to design your robot.  It is probably not even meant to
<br>
get people to be nicer to their robots in the future.
<br>
<p>The point of movies like this, which mainstream reviewers understand,
<br>
is to relate to today's people and today's life.  The robots and such
<br>
are just a vehicle to tell stories about people today.  The movie is
<br>
not about people's inhumanity to robots, it's about people's inhumanity
<br>
to people.  It's not about a robot who learns to love, it's about love
<br>
itself and the pain and joy it can bring.
<br>
<p>No mainstream reviewer has suggested that the movie teaches them anything
<br>
about how they should behave in a future world where robots are common.
<br>
This prospect is so remote and unlikely from the perspective of most
<br>
reviewers that it would be absurd to draw any such lesson.
<br>
