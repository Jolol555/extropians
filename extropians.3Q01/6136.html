I think you are correct. I was waiting to see some global leadership in
<br>
Bush's speech and there was none. Also very little factual information. This
<br>
could have been written months ago with a few &quot;fill in the blank&quot; spots.
<br>
<p>In reality there is a lot of cooperation between states that don't have the
<br>
fondest regards for each other in the area of terrorism. Every state knows
<br>
it can happen to them and will cooperate where they might not otherwise. 
<br>
<p>Sort of like the standoff over undersea communication cables. During the
<br>
world wars every country could cut the cables of each other but no one did
<br>
knowing theirs would be cut also. Sort of a version of MAD.

<em>&gt;&quot;We and our allies around the world will defend our nations and our
