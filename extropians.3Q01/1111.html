<p><em>&gt;In Canada's case we have a Constitution in which we can find &quot;...Whereas

</em><br>
<p>Being a former-Canadian, I remember balking at the pre-amble of the 
<br>
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (essentially, the Canadian 
<br>
Constitution).  However, after I thought about it for a little while, I 
<br>
realized that like most things Canadian, the statement is rather ambiguous 
<br>
in a tame sort of way.  Note that the word &quot;recognize&quot; is used as opposed 
<br>
to &quot;affirm&quot; or &quot;uphold.&quot;  In typical Trudeau fashion, the preamble can be 
<br>
interpreted in a few ways.  Also of note is the &quot;founded upon&quot; term.  Just 
<br>
because a nation is founded upon such principles doesn't mean that it needs 
<br>
to maintain them indefinitely.  What is a real shame is that the rest of 
<br>
the Charter is equally ambiguous.  If Canada's population was ten times the 
<br>
size it is, the nation would be in a world of legal woes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Canada-USA increase by about 300,000 + 3,200,000 per year. I would like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;see a faith-based public works project to build a model city plus
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surroundings on the Canada-US border. Maybe total population of about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1,000,000. Let's see who can translate those principles and definitions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into the reality of a habitat/lifestyle on this planet which is really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;first rate. &quot;Faith without works is dead&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Better yet...let's see USA swallow the nation of Canada and immerse it with 
<br>
its own constitution.  At least the Western half wouldn't mind so much, 
<br>
since there is such an unfair dichotomy between the views of the East and 
<br>
that of the West.  BC and Alberta (Calgary in particular) would benefit 
<br>
greatly by incorporation into the United States, and the rest of Canada 
<br>
would have more than enough resources to essentially continue without undue 
<br>
hardship (other than a deflated economy...though that wouldn't be anything 
<br>
new).
