<p>
The dictionary explains that dignity means:
<br>
1) The quality of being worthy of esteem or respect
<br>
2) Formality in bearing and appearance
<br>
3) High office or rank or station
<br>
<p><p>Questions:
<br>
1) Does a human being confined by its limitations (such as having to defecate, having sexual desires and aggressive tendencies), have dignity?
<br>
2) Does a human being, afraid of believing in themselves yet relying on an unquestionable belief in others (such as an abstract universal God), have dignity?
<br>
3) Does a person's attributes, generated by chance, give that person dignity just because it resulted from chance?
<br>
4) Does a person, afraid to learn and discover the unknown, have dignity because of such fear?
<br>
5) Does a person with a hatred towards learning more about the universe have dignity because of such hatred?
<br>
6) Does a person, afraid to stand up to peer pressure (from the masses) and thus blindly passes laws in the name of morality, have dignity?
<br>
<p><p>Conclusion:
<br>
Cloning does not degrade dignity, but it actually helps promote it. Those trees had barked up the wrong dogs (and yes, trees, like dogs, have bark too).
<br>
<p>If they still have dignity, we had better leave planet Earth. I don't want to let their madness infect my mind and confine my environment.
