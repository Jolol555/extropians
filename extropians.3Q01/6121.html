Well, so do I. However, I think that the idea that American military
<br>
people would be so casual about firing on freinds, relatives, etc is at
<br>
least as laughable. Being a veteran myself, I can pretty much say that
<br>
outside of a few nuts and racists, 99% of military personnel would say
<br>
that the idea of shooting at Americans is not what they signed up for,
<br>
and would be considered to be illegal orders. The only possible
<br>
exceptions to this, I think, would be shooting at left wingers.... you
<br>
might get more cooperation on that score (oh, and lawyers, too)....

<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;I think that the best option is secession of some small population US

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which seeks to get 20,000 libertarian minded people to move to one state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to tip its political balance toward libertarian policies if not outright
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; secession. Current top candidates are New Hampshire and Alaska, among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; others like Wyoming, etc. Note that the secessionist party in Alaska
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allegedly got 25% of the vote in the last election, and New Hampshire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has elected more libertarian state legistlators (25) in the last ten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; years than any other.&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   I have to say Alaska would be the best bet.  620,000 population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not sure whether that includes military personnell.  You'd have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; prepared for some shenigans involving absentee voting by all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; military personnel who spent a tour in Alaska and declared it their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; home of record to get the resident stipend :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   It's arguably the best state to go it alone, geographically isolated,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plentiful rescources, not sharing a common border with the states is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; helpful.  But maybe the most important part is only Hawaii has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better legitimate legal justification for seccession.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   Bringing about a statewide referendum on the &quot;4 choices&quot; wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be nearly as difficult to pull off as trying to get a plurality in Wyoming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To say nothing of trying to run an independant country out of New
</em><br>
