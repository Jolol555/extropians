<em>&gt; Well obviously!  Maybe my point was not clear.  My point is that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expecting the libertarian government NOT to act rationally in its own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interest.  This contradicts what libertarians want -- they want people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to act rationally in their own self-interest.  Why would you expect a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian government to act altruistically, when you would not expect a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business to act altruistically?
</em><br>
<p>Because a government has what a business does not have: the power to
<br>
enforce its will by itself, it will not be empowered to vote itself free
<br>
lunches. This is why we have things today like the 9th amendment. As
<br>
I've illustrated various weaknesses in the US constitution that prevent
<br>
it from remaining libertarian like it was when it first set out, fixing
<br>
weaknesses like these should prevent another similar lapse.
<br>
<p>As I've written before, how 'libertarian' a society and it's government
<br>
remains is directly due to a) how much 'buy in' every citizen has to the
<br>
high trust system, and b) how vigilant they are to maintaining that high
<br>
trust system. By expanding the franchise to blacks and women
<br>
automatically without mandating that they undergo a proper amount of
<br>
'citizenship' training, by castrating the citizenship training that is
<br>
required of immigrants, and by not fully accepting on a social level
<br>
these new enfranchisees as full citizens, we've diluted the 'trust
<br>
rating' in our society of one individual for another, and distorted the
<br>
laws as a result.
<br>
<p>If you want to make and keep a libertarian society, all that is required
<br>
is that you hold closely to (a) and (b). Failure to do so results in
<br>
devolution toward tyranny.
