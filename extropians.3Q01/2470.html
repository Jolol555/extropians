<p><em>&gt;&gt; I am as certain that there is no God as I am that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; man walked on the moon, and equally sure that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is no non-technological afterlife, as say the propo-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; nents of reincarnation claim.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah.  Are you as certain that your idea of technology and what it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can and will be into the indefinite future is complete enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you can be certain what that future technology (almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indistinquishable from magic) will and will not enable?
</em><br>
<p>I'm pretty confident.  David Deutsch's chapter on virtual
<br>
reality in &quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot; does a good job of
<br>
explaining how anything computable can be rendered by
<br>
a universal image generator.  So, as far as what can be
<br>
experienced, I would say yes.  Now, of course, as to
<br>
whether certain capabilities will obtain, (say timeloops,
<br>
or transformations involving black holes, other physics
<br>
challenges) one is of course completely uncertain.  Does
<br>
that answer your question?  Sorry if not.  Repeat or
<br>
explain how I might answer further, thanks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you certain that none of that near-magic is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already afoot and that none of it had a part in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own being here?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I am about as confident of that as I am that
<br>
evolution is a fact, and is the process by which people
<br>
derived from inanimate matter.  I am also as confident
<br>
that no magic is presently at work on our world as I
<br>
am that my brain is not in a jar in Moscow, with all
<br>
the amazing inputs to it being created by diligent
<br>
psychiatrists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If there is an afterlife it will be through technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can see coming...
</em><br>
<p>Are you certain that becoming reborn and accepting Jesus
<br>
as your personal Savior won't guarantee your everlasting
<br>
life with God, in a much simpler and more straightforward
<br>
way?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...or through technology that we don't have much clue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about that may or may not already be locally present.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but to me only in the sense that this might be a
<br>
simulation *only*.  (That is, there never really was life
<br>
on Earth, never was a multiverse, never really was
<br>
anyone except the persons now living, and we are 
<br>
experiencing only a computer simulation devised by
<br>
some alien.)  I don't believe that any secret technology,
<br>
alien or future, is here at work on Earth.  I believe in
<br>
all the patterns of human fallibility and delusions
<br>
chronicaled by &quot;The Skeptical Inquirer&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you so sure of how Mind will grow and extend and what its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limits will ultimately be as to say there is no such Mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already present or will not be or that it will not transcend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time itself?
</em><br>
<p>Well, since you are asking for my opinion, I don't think
<br>
that there is a shred of evidence that there is such a 
<br>
Mind already present.  I have entertained the idea that
<br>
large collections of human beings, especially nations, 
<br>
which sometimes seem to have a personality, are conscious.
<br>
But on reflection and analysis, it doesn't to me seem to
<br>
be the case.  So I believe that a present Mind is about as
<br>
likely as a present God.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you so utterly certain that all who claim to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been touched by such a Mind or have caught a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small glimpse of it or from within it are simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; victims of a biochemical storm and nothing else?
</em><br>
<p>Basically yes.  Now I do not deny the possibly beauty
<br>
and significance of their visions.  Indeed I imagine
<br>
that their experiences have captured some deep
<br>
aspirations of humanity, and have probably encoded
<br>
a number of poetical and summarizing impressions of
<br>
our lives.  But experiences that result from religious
<br>
ecstacy or drugs are not to be trusted for the delivery
<br>
of fact about our universe (so I contend).  All
<br>
conjectures about what is actually happening in our
<br>
universe (I further contend) must survive the gauntlet
<br>
of critical skepticism and non-trivial efforts at
<br>
objective falsification.
