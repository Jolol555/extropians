<em>&gt; About a year ago, I engaged in a short debate with a lecturer about whether students understand the homework they do or not. This lecturer insisted that since students can solve the homework problems, it means they understood the text. Since he marks my

<p>Richard Feynman noticed the same thing on a sabbatical to Brazil many

years ago. The students there would memorize scientific facts and

theories, and have terrific recall, but have absolutely no idea how they

applied to real world problems and phenomena. Read &quot;Surely You're

Joking, Mr. Feynman&quot;, by Richard Feynman....
