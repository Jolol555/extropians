Brain-Inspired Computing
<br>
<a href="http://www.cosmiverse.com/tech08220102.html">http://www.cosmiverse.com/tech08220102.html</a>
<br>
NASA has developed a computing device that allows machines to work very much
<br>
like the brain.
<br>
<p>The technology may allow fast-thinking machines to make decisions based on
<br>
what they see. For example, a planetary rover might use this technology to
<br>
avoid obstacles, select scientifically interesting spots to explore just by
<br>
what it sees and can navigate through terrain on its own without review from
<br>
ground controllers. A spacecraft might use the technology to avoid hazards and
<br>
identify a pre-selected landing site with extreme precision.
<br>
<p>&quot;This may well be recognized as a quantum leap in the pursuit of intelligent
<br>
vision, allowing machines to be significantly more autonomous,&quot; said Dr. Anil
<br>
Thakoor, supervisor of the Bio-Inspired Technology and Systems Group at NASA's
<br>
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
<br>
<p>The device works much like the brain. The brain¹s power comes from the complex
<br>
networks of interconnections called synapses between brain cells. Networks of
<br>
these brain cells, called neurons, allow humans to make instant decisions
<br>
based on an observed image or scene. This new device captures the same
<br>
capability to process images in real time as a scene unfolds.
<br>
<p>The Three-Dimensional Artificial Neural Network processor is capable of
<br>
recognizing objects in real time and in highly cluttered background scenes. It
<br>
can process an image and is capable of a certain degree of judgment about the
<br>
objects, much the same way as a person looks at a variety of objects and makes
<br>
judgments about the nature of those objects.
<br>
<p>Two technologies combined give the compact processor an unprecedented ability
<br>
to process a stream of images in a way similar to that used by the human
<br>
eye-brain combination. One is the JPL-pioneered, highly interconnected
<br>
networks of ultra-low-power electronic synapses on very-
<br>
large-scale-integrated chips that mimic the core of a brain. The other is the
<br>
three- dimensional stacking of those chips in a sugar-cube sized package
<br>
developed by Irvine Sensors Corporation, Costa Mesa, Calif.
<br>
<p>The device achieves a computing speed of more than a trillion operations per
<br>
second using only 8 watts of power. This device is about thousand times faster
<br>
than a typical desktop computer that consumes more than 100 watts of power.
<br>
<p>Engineers believe potential commercial benefits for the new technology may be
<br>
found in public safety. And can also be used in creating a personal computer
<br>
that can respond to users' emotional states by recognizing their facial
<br>
expressions. The development may also be useful to the video game industry in
<br>
improving interactive technologies.
<br>
<p>The processor was developed by JPL's Center for Space Microelectronics
<br>
Technology, under sponsorship from the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.
<br>
The processor allows real time onboard target recognition by an interceptor
<br>
for missile defense.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
