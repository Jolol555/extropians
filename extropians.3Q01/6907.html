There is also another facet to this which Michael Wiik brought up which
<br>
is good ole plain survival. We all know that technology is evolving to
<br>
put more and more power into the hands of individuals and small groups.
<br>
Putting 4 airplanes into the hands of the terrorists is just a very small
<br>
example of what is potentially coming. Are we forced to throw out our
<br>
principles when faced with this situation, where we cannot wait for a
<br>
&quot;tat&quot; to defect because it may end the world? We aren't there yet, but
<br>
we may be as we near AI, nanotech, and more advanced forms of biowarfare.
<br>
<p>For now I throw my view behind what the government (and even Eliezer)
<br>
is apparently suggesting: a prolonged war against terrorists specifically
<br>
and any governments that are actively supporting terrorists. I do not
<br>
believe it makes any sense to deviate from this task to do &quot;retaliation&quot;
<br>
against bystanders in any countries, and I don't think our government
<br>
is planning that anyway. My long term concern though is 10+ years out
<br>
from now do we have to take these measures even farther. Does the
<br>
prisoner's dilemma break down when the cost of a defecting player ends
<br>
the game or in general suddenly becomes much more costly for the other
<br>
players?
