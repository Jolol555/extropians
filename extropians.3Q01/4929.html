From: &quot;Mike Lorrey&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20Paying%20for%20Schools%20(was:%20SOCIETY:%20Re:%20The%20privatization%20of%20public%20%20security)&In-Reply-To=&lt;015101c12d89$525f47b0$0a79afce@braniac&gt;">mlorrey@datamann.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A public school system CAN be economically efficient if it is subject to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same competetive pressures of the free market, and if all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are given their freedom to choose (why is it left wingers seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think we should have freedom of choice in some things, but not in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others?).
</em><br>
<p>(Assuming I am understanding what you meant by left wingers and freedom of
<br>
choice) Mike, do you understand the difference between, say, a local police
<br>
department and a local branch of the KKK?  A police sergeant may belong to
<br>
the KKK group (there's the freedom of choice), but he cannot represent the
<br>
police department while speaking for the KKK group (i.e., he cannot wear his
<br>
police uniform, thereby giving the impression that the police department
<br>
supports the KKK, although the police sergeant, as an individual, can be a
<br>
member).
<br>
<p>A democracy may support the right of groups like the KKK to exist, but
<br>
local, state and federal governments cannot ask taxpayers to support
<br>
parochialism of the kind the KKK represents.
<br>
<p>In the same vein, private schools may exist in a host of flavors
<br>
(specializing in upper-middle class college prep, or employ a creationist
<br>
curriculum, or have a foreign language emphasis, or be exclusive for a
<br>
myriad reasons), but governments cannot ask taxpayers to support
<br>
parochialism, so public schools are necessarily set at &quot;neutral,&quot; and open
<br>
to all citizens (and even non-citizens) of the United States.
