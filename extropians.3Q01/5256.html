<em>&gt; I don't agree with Peikoff very much. Objectivism is just another form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of essentialism, and I do not like essentialism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree analytic truths are necessary, as are other abstractions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality being one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I wasnt familiar with the term so I did some searching. Heres what I got:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.xrefer.com/entry/343888">http://www.xrefer.com/entry/343888</a>
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
Essentialism, in philosophy, is the doctrine that things have essential
<br>
properties, properties without which they would not be the things that they
<br>
are. Many philosophers hold that the essence of water is its real essence;
<br>
the essence of water is H2O. So the stuff in my glass has an essential
<br>
property, a property without which it would not be the stuff that it is; if
<br>
the stuff in my glass did not have the property of being H2O, then it would
<br>
not be water.
<br>
<p>Anti-essentialists hold that there are no essential properties (properties
<br>
without which things would not be the things that they are) independently of
<br>
our definitions and ways of classifying things. Being a rational animal is
<br>
an essential property of humans, but this is merely because we have chosen
<br>
to define 'human' as 'rational animal', because we have chosen to
<br>
classifying something as a human just if it is a rational animal. And things
<br>
do not have essential properties independently of our definitions and ways
<br>
of classifying things. AJ
<br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>Am I to understand about this Anti-essentialist view that &quot;there are no
<br>
essential properties independently of our definitions and ways of
<br>
classifying things&quot;. This goes to the heart of Rand's theory of concept
<br>
formation. Heres an example of how one forms a concept. Imagine if you have
<br>
3 balls. One is light blue, one is dark blue, and one is red. You notice an
<br>
attribute that is similar between 2 of the balls that the 3rd doesnt
<br>
possess, even though this attribute differs in magnitude. You mentally
<br>
isolate this attribute and tag a lable on it, in english this label is
<br>
&quot;Blue&quot;. The attribute does in fact exist in reality, it does in fact exist
<br>
for all people with the proper machinery to detect this fact (those
<br>
colorblind may not detect it, but a lack of information isnt a
<br>
contridiction). Man disnt make this up, this attribute is in fact an
<br>
&quot;essential&quot; attribute of blue. It IS blue. In the example they use above, if
<br>
you remove the attribute &quot;H2O&quot; from &quot;water&quot;, you dont have water anymore. If
<br>
I'm off base on this, please explain. I really am interested in this branch
<br>
of philosophy. Thanks!
<br>
<p>Jerry
<br>
<p>P.S. I only push this to the list because it looks like others might be
<br>
interested in this aspect of philosophy, if anyone thinks that its better
<br>
served to discuss this elsewhere, just let me know and Ill drop it here.
