You seem to be making solipsistic arguments. But I like solipsism.
<br>
<p>I see each person as having individual discreet realities, rather than
<br>
there being one external reality. Community happens when individual
<br>
people choose to place their separate realities in sync. If a fireball
<br>
crosses the sky it is not one head which turns but many heads. Each
<br>
person sees, but there are as many fireballs as there are people, with
<br>
each representing an entire process going from stimulus to recognition.
<br>
<p>With all the protocols existent in science today regarding publishing
<br>
and duplication of results, I fail to see why people cannot acknowledge
<br>
authority and societal factors in truth and knowledge.
<br>
<p>I've changed, actually. There was a time when I sought to reduce as much
<br>
as possible, and I still pride myself on that ability. I used to always
<br>
break things down to the smallest possible terms, but realized one day
<br>
the cognition required to facilitate so much detail at once is immense,
<br>
and I conceded to not keep up. It was a good lesson for me. There is so
<br>
much more power in abstraction.

<em>&gt;Why are you more certain that you live in a world of language,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;objectification, and mental abstractions, than you live in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world of earth, air, fire, and water?  Such things as language
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could not exist were they not evolved in matter creatures, nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could mental abstractions.  You are choosing to build up your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;model of what the world is on top of very shaky ideas that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can't even know that other people possess, because you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even know that there are other people.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How do you know that there is a &quot;we&quot;?  I suggest that your inference
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that there are other people is much weaker than your inference that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there is a 3-D world outside your skin.
