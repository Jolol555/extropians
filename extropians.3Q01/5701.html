(something like 30%) in the flow rate of the conveyor current in the North

Atlantic over the last few decades.

<p><p>Most of the academic sources I've read are coming from European
<br>
universities, and are being published in Nature and Science.  Hardly an oil
<br>
company conspiracy.  In fact, these days it seems only the American nitwits
<br>
(and a few others) are actually saying that global warming will create a hot
<br>
planet.
<br>
<p>My point was that &quot;global warming&quot; doesn't actually appear to generate a
<br>
warm globe as a substantial consequence, which many people are assuming.
<br>
The &quot;new and improved&quot; climate models that take into account ocean
<br>
current/CO2 dynamics are mapping much more closely to the ice core data than
<br>
the ones that have previously been predicting massive temperature increases.
<br>
<p>The first evidence of any of this came many, many years ago when ice cores
<br>
revealed that historical atmospheric CO2 levels generally had a negative
<br>
correlation to increasing global temperature, contrary to scientific theory.
<br>
This has now been confirmed by ice cores taken from Greenland and Antarctica
<br>
by different international teams.  The conveyor currents were discovered
<br>
many years ago as an accident of oceanic nuclear testing, but have now been
<br>
fairly well described and measured by numerous academic institutions.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying that the climate isn't changing (it is a dynamic system, why
<br>
wouldn't it?), but I am somewhat irritated that popular momentum is almost
<br>
completely detached from the scientific work that is being done on the very
<br>
same topic.  If people are going to come up with a &quot;solution&quot; it could at
<br>
least have some basis in science.  Of course, the data also suggests that
<br>
there is not a whole lot we can actually do to control the climate these
<br>
days; every set of ice cores shows that it oscillates wildly by nature and
<br>
that we've been living in an anomalous stable period since the last ice age.
<br>
Better to stop provoking it and work on adapting to that particular reality.
