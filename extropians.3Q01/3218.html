<p>Oh, no!  I have heard the stories about how Eliezer runs his singularity list with an iron fist!  &quot;To the dungeon with those who have less then perfect punctuation or who disagree with me!&quot;    
<br>
<p>And his future Sysop is bound to take after him(like father, like son!).  A stern yet compassionate A.I. which benevolently lords it over us all.  But wait, A.I. won't have emotions according to Eliezer!  I just anthropomorphized them!  See, I caught myself. ;)

Well, I don't know about this concept and its history, but I think we ought to have an Intellicratic forum for coordinating and developing extropian ideals.

<p>Eliezer, it looks like you can be a mentor to this young fellow(an eighteen year-old stripling).  You have the age and experience to bring him up right in the ways of Extropianism and Singularitianism! :) 
<br>
<p>The young Jedi master must gather apprentices so they can become strong in the power of extropy.   
<br>
<p>best wishes,
