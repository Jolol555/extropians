Amazing, isn't it, the incredible diversity of opinions about uploading
<br>
and embodiment on Extropians itself?
<br>
<p>Anders Sandberg writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, cybergnosticism - the material world is inefficient and impure, and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should strive to become pure information - is unfortunately rampant among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanists. But that doesn't mean it is a very workable philosophy, IMHO.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, why would one on principle strive to become &quot;pure information&quot;, as if there
<br>
was such a thing independent of the material world anyway?  Of course, there
<br>
are many shortcomings to the material world; but we have known that for hundreds
<br>
of thousands of years, and take great pains to live in artificial realities
<br>
all the time.  Where I live, for example, (inside a house) I have nearly
<br>
complete control over the temperature.  My ancestors found it unsuitable to
<br>
be exposed to the elements the way animals are.
<br>
<p>John Smart has recently explained this rather well in his June newsletters
<br>
(see www.singularitywatchers.com):
<br>
<p>&quot;Once our simulations reach a certain complexity, we learn about reality far faster and
<br>
more effectively by building and exploring our models than we do by continuing to muck
<br>
about in the physical world. I call this phenomenon &quot;the Supremacy of Simulations,&quot; and
<br>
have more to say about it in my forthcoming book.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Of course, all human thought essentially a simulation.  And we use this model, this
<br>
highly selective subset of our past perceptions, to filter our new inputs. The simulation
<br>
constrains the branch points we could take, it curbs the combinatorial explosion of
<br>
possibilities.  As children, we spend a tremendous amount of time in sensorimotor
<br>
interaction with the real world.  Then once we have built reasonable facsimile
<br>
simulations, we make a huge transition to an interior world, where we spend most of our
<br>
time in internal simulations, and thenceforth precious little time interacting with
<br>
external reality.  I've read the average U.S. adult spends four minutes a day entirely
<br>
outdoors, soaking in the &quot;real&quot; world.  The rest of our discretionary time is spent more
<br>
profitably in an interior landscape: Thinking. Running simulations.&quot;
<br>
<p>Anders continues,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I see it, uploads are still going to be embodied. As I argued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at TransVision 00 in London, uploads might actually be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obsessed with their bodies than we are currently!
</em><br>
<p>This might occur for a while, but soon the innate slowness of the physical
<br>
world would take its toll.  Since one can think, experience, and enjoy
<br>
millions of times faster in virtual reality than when constantly inter-
<br>
acting with the &quot;real&quot; world, I expect my outside sensors not to be
<br>
overly busy.
