<em>&gt; &gt; and the fact that Mathematica provides most or all of Wolfram's income, I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to ask: is there an open source version of Mathematica?  The concept is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, but there are other numerical algebra packages. None of them are as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced and rounded as Mathematica or Maple.
</em><br>
<p>I think, why don't we write a better one than theirs, one radically different but much better?
<br>
<p>Consider this: They do use programmatic mathematical notations to model the universe, however, not in the way I had originally thought. My version has more of a programmatic than a maths structure.
<br>
<p>In fact, if you actually look at what I now have in mind, it would seem like some Visual Basic and C++ hybrid, very very much like programming code. You can even make a compiler and run that, I think. This consists of a subtle but important difference. Maybe he had thought of that too, but from what I managed to read up to now, no.
<br>
<p><p>&lt; &quot;Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe. &quot;  --Albert Einstein &gt;
<br>
<p>I hesitate to add a third: Greed (or perhaps disires)
