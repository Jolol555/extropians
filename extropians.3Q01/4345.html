The blood of billions *will* be on the hands of those arguing against cryonics whether or not the reanimations or recreations are done with or without either nanotech or the SysOp.

<p>I remember this &quot;favorite quote&quot; from Extro-5.  It does seem a little extreme to me.  I don't see it as a quote to use in the mass media.  Then again, maybe it is just the shock treatment needed!

I tend to agree with Robert above that ultimately this is due to the understanding that if cryonics works, if currently dead people are some day brought back to life, then we are all responsible for a holocaust
<br>
beyond imagining.  Every person allowed to die today without suspension is an unnecessary and preventable death.  As Robert says, the blood of billions is on our hands.  Most people are not able to deal emotionally with the horror of this possibility.

<p>I think the critics of cryonics REALLY view it as totally unfeasible on grounds they see as scientificially sound.  I do think they have the blinders on in not trying to grasp just how advanced technological progress will be long term.  Perhaps, cryonicists have the power to think &quot;outside the box,&quot; while the critics cannot, or choose not to.    
<br>
<p>I bet the critics would scoff at the very idea of feeling &quot;emotional horror&quot; after having scoffed at cryonics, and causing many to turn away from it, to their doom.  Decades from now some of them may experience it.
<br>
<p>As for all of us having, &quot;blood on our hands,&quot; I must say their have been strong efforts to spread the word about cryonics.  The public so far is simply not convinced!  Just ask media savvy people like Robert Ettinger, Charles Platt and Linda Chamberlain!  They could really tell you some stories.  
<br>
<p>I compare cryonics to my days as a Mormon missionary.  People love to talk, they may accept literature and even a return visit, but don't expect many people to want to get baptized!!
<br>
<p>Actually, a fund is being developed to put forward a major marketing program to promote cryonics.  One-hundred thousand dollars was donated by a private source.  And now a matching sum needs to be raised before action is taken.
<br>
<p>he continues:
<br>
(Of course, even most of us signed up for cryonics aren't doing anything about it either, and we are the ones who are most likely to have to face consequences eventually for our inaction.)
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>In our own personal lives, the answer is probably yes.  How many of us do our &quot;missionary work&quot; in trying to share the cryonics message?  My own family were more adament then ever in saying no, even after viewing The Alcor Adventure video with me.  At least they understand the subject better now.  
<br>
<p>Even my atheist/agnostic brother with a love for computers said no.  He felt cryonics was very macabre, and somehow against nature.  He hangs out with a bunch of rock music playing tree huggers! :)  
<br>
<p>Some people are in a position to REALLY advance cryonics(the very wealthy), and sometimes they have.  Saul Kent and Will Faloon are examples of this.  Their money spent on research will benefit cryonics immensely.  And the Timeship will put cryonics on the map in a titanic way which has never before been seen.  If they stay on course, Saul and Kent will be sainted sometime down the road.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, you have Don Laughlin.  He owns a casino, and is signed up for cryonics.  Every so often, he even puts on the Cryonics &quot;High Rollers&quot; conference.  But, despite numerous attempts by cryonics leaders, he will not make a large donation to further research and infrastructure in a major way.  I would not want to be Don Laughlin waking up into the mid 21st century.  There may be people there not too happy with him...   
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
