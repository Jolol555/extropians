Wow, Russell. This is some of the best sense I have seen.
<br>
<p>Very well thought out. Especially the point about extended lifespan vs 
<br>
immortality. I am continually astonished that almost nobody I know 
<br>
personally wants to live forever... but none of them have any problems with 
<br>
adding several years of good health.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Miriam

<em>&gt;closely-defined particular political viewpoint, for example, even if we

</em><br>
<em>&gt;seem to any of us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, there's a lot of point, I think, to getting behind campaigns for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;basic political rights such as freedom of speech, religion and conscience, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and adopting the associated slogans. Over the next couple of decades, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;luddites are going to try to suppress technologies and try to drive out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;views that they consider &quot;metaphysically damaging&quot; (yes, that is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expression I keep seeing). In doing so, they will reject the classical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;liberal ideal of society. The classical liberal ideal has no room for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imposition of metaphysical beliefs and is our great strength. If we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continue to live in a society where the classical liberal ideal is, er, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;respected, I think the necessary technologies will be developed and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;marketed by people with the interest and talent, and will be taken up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;widely as their advantages are seen by ordinary people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Beyond that, since we have to take it one step at a time, I tend to think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the initial focus of our more positive meme deployment should be on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the idea that extended life is a good idea. That is hard for lots of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people to swallow ideologically (extended longevity - it's, it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;splutter&gt; *unnatural*), but it also has an obvious attraction. Almost 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everyone wants to live longer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Once we make some headway getting this idea out as a legitimate one, a lot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of other stuff follows.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I like Reason's focus on the longevity meme. I also like Zero's slogan: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Life is good. Refuse to die.&quot; If we could come up with a few more like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this it'd be great.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If Eliezer's work is successful, I guess the meme war is almost 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;irrelevant. But I don't want to put all my eggs in the one singularity.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
