<em>&gt; Actually, I have read it. Highly recommended, Mike; I second your view that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, it doesn't present an objective basis for the preeminence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Western concepts in the sense of arguing in any way that such concepts are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *justified*. It merely offers a speculative economic history of how Western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization happened to conquer other civilizations, largely by better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons, superior materials, and resistance to smallpox. All of these were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little more than historical accidents - that's Diamond's whole point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This kind of theory is hardly a basis for moral realism and I'd be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astonished if Diamond himself thought anything of the kind.
</em><br>
<p>While the central thesis of Diamond's, that cultures of the eurasian
<br>
band were destined for dominance due to evolution of more domesticable
<br>
plants and animals in that region than others, this still leaves a lot
<br>
of room, from the collectivism of China to nomadism of the steppes and
<br>
the individualism of europe, as well as the theocracies and other
<br>
systems of Indus, Euphrates, and Nile Valleys, etc. and that resistance
<br>
to smallpox (which developed most strongly among individualistic
<br>
herders) and the need for superior materials for the same, it is rather
<br>
plain that such occurences are a part of natural evolution in a complex
<br>
ecosystem. That this is a natural evolution, it is similarly likely to
<br>
occur on other worlds as well (and don't try any of that Saganistic
<br>
'aliens could look like anything' claptrap. While aliens could look like
<br>
anything, one of my longstanding theses is that intelligent species that
<br>
develop technological civilizations will evolve in similar fashion as
<br>
humans did. Those aliens that do not develop technology will never come
<br>
in contact with us, and therefore do not count.) Also, because this
<br>
process is a natural evolution, it is an objective basis for the
<br>
morality of that culture which comes out on top and survives most
<br>
successfully.
