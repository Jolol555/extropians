<p><em>&gt; Some say that, whenever faced with [the] choice, the only ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision is to raise the embryo - but I disagree, and I suspect most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people on this list also do.
</em><br>
<p>Some people do not wish the embryo raised because they selfishly
<br>
don't want it to compromise their lifestyle.  That is their complete
<br>
(legal) right, IMO, or should be.  But they should admit that they
<br>
are being quite selfish, denying life to someone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Certainly, if the owners of the embryo wish to raise it, then it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be raised.  But if they do not, then they may dispose of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tissue as they see fit - up to the point where it can survive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent of life support
</em><br>
<p>I agree.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The mere potential future existence of an organism does not, in itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grant the potential organism any right to live, especially if its life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would detract from the quality of life of previously existing organisms.
</em><br>
<p>What do you mean &quot;right&quot;?  Do you mean there should not be a legal right
<br>
for that organism to come into being (I agree)?  I don't know what else
<br>
you could mean here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...Otherwise, the only ethical activity for all human beings would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constant, ceaseless reproduction, tempered only by the need to ensure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that newborns reach puberty.
</em><br>
<p>The *only* ethical activity?  I'm sure that you don't mean to put that
<br>
in anyone's mouth.  You are probably criticizing the view that I hold,
<br>
namely, that all other things being equal, there should be the maximum
<br>
number possible of beings who can enjoy being alive.  Further, we should
<br>
strive to create as many as we possibly can, short of severely compromising
<br>
the quality of our own lives (for the sake of our aforementioned selfishness).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Put another way: if the matter which comprises you were to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reassembled into a different person, with nature rerolling the dice to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come up with something completely random, would the average expected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quality be higher or lower than what you have achieved?
</em><br>
<p>:-)  IMNSHO, the expected quality would be worse.
<br>
