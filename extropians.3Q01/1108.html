<p><em>&gt; ... I am a typical American

</em><br>
<p>In Canada's case we have a Constitution in which we can find &quot;...Whereas
<br>
Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God....&quot;
<br>
Perhaps President Bush got the wrong country with his &quot;faith-based public
<br>
works&quot; and &quot;culture of life&quot;. That fits with the &quot;revelation&quot; by CBC's
<br>
satirical &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; during the Bush campaign. The
<br>
interviewer told Bush that Prime Minister &quot;Poutine&quot; of Canada had endorsed
<br>
him as leader of the free world and asked Bush what he thought of
<br>
that. Without missing a beat your &quot;C Student&quot; waxed eloquent on the
<br>
excellent relations between USA and Canada. (I'd like to hear what he has
<br>
to say now about Michael J. Fox being President of Mexico).
<br>
<p>The definition of &quot;religion&quot; is pretty slippery though we all use the word
<br>
as if everyone understands it. The Bible mentions it only three
<br>
times. My Webster's definition #4 seems closest to the popular usage: &quot;a
<br>
cause, principle or belief held to with faith or ardour&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I have stated before God is Truth.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... I am not against a God centered legal system because that would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create a society that was truth centered. The problem arises when the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state decides that it is going to be a mediator between God and Man 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of an institution that upholds Gods laws and is itself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject to those laws.  
</em><br>
<p>Canada is already a God-centred nation by Constitution. I was sent the 60
<br>
or so pages of Hansard by Dennis Mills, MP from 1981 when the inclusion of
<br>
that clause quoted above was debated. Even Prime Minister Jean
<br>
&quot;Poutine&quot; Chretien, then Justice Minister, wanted it in the Charter of
<br>
Rights and Freedoms portion of the Constitution. Trouble is we don't have
<br>
a definition of Canada's God...which would also in effect give a
<br>
definition of Canada's religion. So I asked House Leader Don Boudria, MP
<br>
who wisely said we should ask the religion experts (like the clergy).
<br>
In Canada's case the mediating role would be left to the clergy but the
<br>
UPHOLDING OF GOD'S LAW IS DEMANDED BY THE CONSTITUTION. And the
<br>
Constitution is the foundation of all law in Canada. But we are back to
<br>
square one. What are those principles of the God of Canada? How would you
<br>
articulate them in a form we all would understand? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... In other words, the state as legislaters become priests so to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speak. 
</em><br>
<p>In Canada's case the JUDGES have become the priesthood deciding on the
<br>
meaning of those &quot;Godly principles&quot; (and practices). I was shocked and
<br>
amazed when I read in the &quot;Reasons for Judgement&quot; of BC Judge F.E. Howard
<br>
her review of how and why this had happened and what it meant. The judges
<br>
got the job by default. The legislatures refused to discuss the matter, ie
<br>
to define God...too much of a hot potato. The clergy are a bunch of
<br>
religion quacks, liars and cowards here as they are in the US and they run
<br>
away from the subject. So THE JUDGES BECAME PRIESTS.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A God centered government would be like the USA government was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; originally intended to be.  The definition of God is agreed upon - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Creator.  God's role in nature and in man's life and existence is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreed upon.  The fact that legislators will be held accountable to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher law - God's law is agreed upon....
</em><br>
<p>Fortunately, in Canada's case we don't have to speculate on the
<br>
&quot;intentions&quot; of people from 200 years ago...or today. Canada
<br>
has a God-centred government by Constitution. Thus those legislators are
<br>
obligated by law to make laws which are in accord with &quot;principles that
<br>
recognize the supremacy of God&quot;. Yet I would like to see just one piece of
<br>
legislation in Canada which is presented with this as a preamble. ALL
<br>
LEGISLATION SHOULD BE PRESENTED AS IN ACCORD WITH GOD'S LAWS. Any other
<br>
legislation is unconstitutional. When we get this straightened out, a lot
<br>
of legislation is going to be axed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then you determine what is the definition of a crime. When you have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defined what a crime is you can create legislation based upon that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legislation.  And this makes for the foundation of your justice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system that is God centered. And that is what our forefathers tried 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do. It defines the role of Government, or God, and of the law 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abiding citizen, and of the criminal. 
</em><br>
<p>Superbly expressed!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What our forefathers did not do is take those definitions further. 
</em><br>
<p>And now you can correct the error by applying for a faith-based grant to
<br>
help Canada define &quot;God&quot;, &quot;principles that recognize the supremacy of
<br>
God&quot; and laws which follow from those principles.
<br>
<p>Canada-USA increase by about 300,000 + 3,200,000 per year. I would like to
<br>
see a faith-based public works project to build a model city plus
<br>
surroundings on the Canada-US border. Maybe total population of about
<br>
1,000,000. Let's see who can translate those principles and definitions
<br>
into the reality of a habitat/lifestyle on this planet which is really
<br>
first rate. &quot;Faith without works is dead&quot;.
<br>
<p>POC 
<br>
<p><p>What kind of city with surroundings would one expect of a &quot;faith-based public works&quot; project with the objective of designing and constructing a &quot;culture of life&quot;? Would a George Bush &quot;culture of life&quot; be the same as a Vatican &quot;culture of life&quot;?
