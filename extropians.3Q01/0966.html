From: &quot;Amara Graps&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:amara@amara.com?Subject=Re:%20Debunking%20Synchronicity%20(was:%20Debunk%20All%20Religiosity%20Equally%20(D.A.R.E.)&In-Reply-To=&lt;02a401c10b08$c6b9e500$5c5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">amara@amara.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Lee was originally asking questions for definitions, so I did my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolute best to find words (which mostly don't exist) to explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some perspectives. He or J.R. can choose to accept it or not, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask questions to try to understand the different perspectives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better, but I must say that I was horrified and very dissapointed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear the immediate knee-jerk condemnations &quot;False&quot; that my way to try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see what was in my subconscious to gain wisdom, be open to learn from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my environment, trying to bring me to a higher awareness  with what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life had to offer me. I don't find it 'false' at all that life has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a richness that I can't explain, and I'm doing my best to explore it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and learn about it in every way available to me.
</em><br>
<p>Playing the definition game doesn't really help to debunk religiosity. So, I
<br>
won't play that game. The question Lee originally asked had to do with _why_
<br>
people use particular terms to describe themselves. Here's the paragraph where
<br>
he asks that:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Okay, so this discussion has gone on ever since Darwin, at least,
<br>
I suspect.  Perhaps there is not only a gene for religiousity,
<br>
but a separate gene that causes one to find the terms &quot;religious&quot;
<br>
and &quot;spiritual&quot; appealing, and causes one to wish very strongly
<br>
to apply them to oneself regardless of one's actual beliefs?
<br>
I'm being only half-serious, of course, but it indicates my
<br>
desperation here to find out what is going on.  My friend came
<br>
to admit that he and I did not differ substantially in either
<br>
our experiences or our beliefs.  So after all that time, I still
<br>
came away perplexed as to why atheists/materialists sometimes
<br>
employ those terms to describe themselves.  Perhaps one of the
<br>
people who so do use the terms could think long and carefully
<br>
and help us understand why.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The question for me is not so much why people describe themselves as
<br>
&quot;spiritual&quot; or &quot;religious&quot; but rather why they hold onto beliefs, sometimes
<br>
even after a clear and rational analysis shows them to be mistaken. This is
<br>
not meant to diminish the importance of Lee's question, because I'd also like
<br>
to know why people hang on to words like &quot;spiritual&quot; to describe themselves. I
<br>
don't want to have to guess that they are sentimental or superstitious, and so
<br>
use these terms to win Pascal's wager. I'd like to hear from them why they
<br>
don't jettison outdated descriptions for something more contemporary. I
<br>
suspect it's more than nostalgia or fond reminiscence, like the comeback of
<br>
hip hugger pants or granny glasses. Then again, perhaps it really is just a
<br>
matter of fashion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If my tools of discovery aren't your tools, then so what? I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like all of your tools either, nor does your way of 'discovering'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world appeal to me (I see it as dry, rigid and not very fun,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be honest), but I don't label your way as &quot;False&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>If one wishes to describe serendipity as a tool of discovery, that's fine with
<br>
me, as long as one doesn't go so far as to conflate it with science. (AFAIC,
<br>
&quot;synchronicity&quot; simply means serendipity in time.) However, I'm surprised to
<br>
the point of dismay with your description of tools of discovery as &quot;dry,
<br>
rigid, and not very fun.&quot; That fairly accurately describes the tedious method
<br>
of science all right, and is a complaint of many who drop out because they
<br>
find the scientific method not very fun. I thought you worked in astrophysics,
<br>
so to read your complaint about &quot;dry, rigid, and not very fun&quot; is a real
<br>
shocker.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry, stay extropic,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
