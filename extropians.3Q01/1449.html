<p>Cracking the Code of Online Censorship
<br>
<p>By JENNIFER 8. LEE
<br>
<p><p><p>VERY year the Electronic Frontier Foundation hands out its Pioneer 
<br>
Awards to people who have played crucial roles in the history of 
<br>
technology. Recipients have included visionaries like Ivan 
<br>
Sutherland, creator of some of the first computer graphics programs; 
<br>
Douglas C. Engelbart, an inventor of the mouse; and Linus Torvalds, 
<br>
inventor of the popular Linux operating system.
<br>
<p>This year one of the three winners was Seth Finkelstein, an activist 
<br>
who decrypts filtering programs, the software used by private 
<br>
companies, libraries and schools to block out undesirable sites. As a 
<br>
founder of the Censorware Project, an anti-filtering advocacy group, 
<br>
Mr. Finkelstein has influenced public debate and legal decisions, 
<br>
including a First Amendment case on filtering policy at a public 
<br>
library in Virginia.
<br>
<p>But most people have probably never heard of him, and until recently 
<br>
that is the way Mr. Finkelstein, a reclusive 36-year-old computer 
<br>
programmer, wanted it. Over the last six years he has spent hundreds 
<br>
of hours decrypting the blacklists of popular Web filtering programs 
<br>
like Cyber Patrol and X-Gear.
<br>
<p>Most filters work by sending out programs that comb the Web for 
<br>
banned words and then produce a list of Web sites containing those 
<br>
words. Those sites are compiled into the closely guarded blacklists 
<br>
that Mr. Finkelstein tries to uncover.
<br>
<p>But don't call him a hacker. He gets prickly when he hears that word. 
<br>
Instead he describes himself as a civil-libertarian software engineer.
<br>
<p>Mr. Finkelstein contends that filtering is not only inherently flawed 
<br>
but that in many cases it even acts as a deliberate censor. Many of 
<br>
the Web sites on the blacklists - feminist sites, gay and lesbian 
<br>
information sites, health sites and religious sites - are more 
<br>
political than pornographic in nature. &quot;This is inevitable,&quot; Mr. 
<br>
Finkelstein said. &quot;Once you give censors free rein, they go after 
<br>
sex. They go after sex education. They go after feminism. They go 
<br>
after gay rights.&quot;
<br>
<p>The makers of filtering software say that criticism of their 
<br>
products' accuracy is old news and they are addressing the problems. 
<br>
&quot;Technology evolves,&quot; said Susan Getgood, vice president for home and 
<br>
education markets at SurfControl, a maker of Web and e- mail 
<br>
filtering products. &quot;It is a long way from the Model T to the BMW Z3 
<br>
and a long way from the early days of filtering to the products on 
<br>
the market today.&quot;
<br>
<p>But Mr. Finkelstein argues that even if filters were free of 
<br>
political bias, they would block some sites in error because they 
<br>
cannot understand context. Most of the software no longer mistakenly 
<br>
blocks sites involving breast cancer or chicken breast recipes, but 
<br>
much of the blocking remains problematic nonetheless.
<br>
<p>Mr. Finkelstein said he was now analyzing a list that blocked the 
<br>
National Institutes of Health's Spanish-language site on diabetes. 
<br>
The Spanish word hora, which means hour and is used often on the 
<br>
page, also happens to be a Swedish word for prostitute.
<br>
<p>&quot;Computers are extremely stupid,&quot; he said. &quot;Talk to any computer 
<br>
scientists, not the marketing people. They'll tell you artificial 
<br>
intelligence cannot determine context.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mr. Finkelstein grew up in the Bronx, where his interest in 
<br>
cryptography was fostered by Sherlock Holmes tales and newspaper 
<br>
cryptograms. He studied mathematics and physics at the Massachusetts 
<br>
Institute of Technology with the goal of becoming a theoretical 
<br>
physicist. When he was rejected by all the top graduate physics 
<br>
programs, he said, he turned to computer programming as a job that 
<br>
paid the bills. But he finds that his technical skills have more 
<br>
meaning in urgent social debates.
<br>
<p>Mr. Finkelstein said he began cracking the filtering blacklists in 
<br>
1995 because he was concerned about how the software was being 
<br>
promoted as an alternative to government censorship. &quot;There was a big 
<br>
social campaign among civil libertarians to talk up and tout 
<br>
censorware as both a legal and social argument against government 
<br>
censorship,&quot; he said. &quot;While I did not oppose the legal argument, I 
<br>
thought strongly that the social campaign was a huge mistake.`
<br>
<p>To crack a filter, Mr. Finkelstein engages in a dance of decryption 
<br>
that is part mathematics, part intuition and part brute force.
<br>
<p>In 1998, his blend of technical skills and political convictions 
<br>
helped the American Civil Liberties Union win a federal lawsuit 
<br>
challenging the library Internet filtering policy in Loudoun County, 
<br>
Va., on First Amendment grounds. Among the sites that the 
<br>
organization said the library blocked was an informative site on safe 
<br>
sex and the American Association of University Women's Maryland site. 
<br>
A federal judge ruled against the library.
<br>
<p>The A.C.L.U. and the American Library Association have also filed 
<br>
suits challenging the Children's Internet Protection Act, passed by 
<br>
Congress last year. The law requires that libraries receiving federal 
<br>
financing and discounts for Internet service under certain federal 
<br>
statutes must install filtering software.
<br>
<p>Mr. Finkelstein's work exposes him to the threat of legal action, too.
<br>
<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act generally forbids the 
<br>
circumvention of digital encryptions, although one of the exemptions 
<br>
granted by the Librarian of Congress is for the decryption of 
<br>
blacklists, largely because of Mr. Finkelstein's lobbying. But even 
<br>
if decrypting the blacklists may be legal, releasing them to the 
<br>
public may not be, since they are a form of intellectual property.
<br>
<p>He said his concerns about the potential for legal trouble were 
<br>
validated when two computer programmers who posted a program that 
<br>
could circumvent Cyber Patrol were sued by Mattel, which was then the 
<br>
parent company of the software's maker. In a settlement last year the 
<br>
programmers agreed to stop posting it on the Web.
<br>
<p>So Mr. Finkelstein had until recently worked relatively anonymously 
<br>
from his cluttered apartment in Cambridge, Mass., passing his 
<br>
information to journalists, lawyers and other activists to publicize.
<br>
<p>Much of his work involves analyzing and documenting incongruities in 
<br>
filtering software. In a report on SmartFilter that he wrote a couple 
<br>
of years ago, for example, Mr. Finkelstein pointed out that it 
<br>
blocked WrestlePages (&quot;The best source for wrestling news&quot;); 
<br>
MotoWorld.com, a motorcycle sport magazine produced by ESPN; and 
<br>
Affirmation: Gay and Lesbian Mormons, a support site. Company 
<br>
officials at Secure Computing (news/quote), which makes SmartFilter, 
<br>
declined to be interviewed about the software but released a 
<br>
statement. &quot;It is not technology such as SmartFilter that makes the 
<br>
rules; it is organizations themselves,&quot; it said.
<br>
<p>Mr. Finkelstein is particularly annoyed that language translation 
<br>
sites are blocked simply because they can circumvent filters. 
<br>
Visitors to a language translation site can enter the Web address of 
<br>
a banned site and then see a translation at a different address.
<br>
<p>&quot;It shows that censorware is about control, not filtering,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>So Mr. Finkelstein intends to continue decrypting, as he scoffs at 
<br>
claims that computer technology is close to acquiring the contextual 
<br>
intelligence needed to identify inappropriate sites.
<br>
<p>&quot;It will be a phenomenal advance,&quot; he said of contextual ability. 
<br>
&quot;They will get the equivalent of a Nobel Prize. They will not be 
<br>
selling it in a tawdry program for a couple of hundred dollars.&quot;
