<em>&gt;  The noble gas xenon is chemically similar to helium,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  except for being nearly 33 times denser.  If a person
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  were to be placed in a pressure chamber with oxygen held at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  0.2 atmospheres, then xenon added until the total pressure came
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  up to about 190 atmospheres, the density of the gas mixture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in the chamber would be about equal to that of water.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  person would then float.  It would simulate weightlessness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  better than being in water, since the xenonaut could breathe the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  medium in which she was floating.
</em><br>
<p>It's a fascinating idea, I wouldn't have realized that a gas could become
<br>
so dense at what is in many ways a moderate pressure.
<br>
<p>However the question is, can people withstand such pressures?  The deepest
<br>
dive record I found on one site was 2250 feet in 1981, breathing a mixture
<br>
of N, O, and He.  That would be about 70 atmospheres.  Could people
<br>
withstand 2-3 times more?  Maybe the record has been improved since 1981.
