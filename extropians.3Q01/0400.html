<p>Due to constraints of physical law, the theoretical maximum efficiency
<br>
of photovoltaic cells is approximately 36% or so. Current state of the
<br>
art cells using dual layers (GaAs and GaAnt) to capture more of the IR
<br>
spectrum have achieved around 33.5 to 34% efficiency, however they are
<br>
very expensive, too much for the degree of greater efficiency over
<br>
silicon cells. The other approach is to make the easiest to fabricate
<br>
cells very cheap to make. Thin film amorphous cells are around 10%
<br>
efficient but are very cheap to make, costing around 12-25 cents /kWh
<br>
(versus over $2.00 for high efficiency cells).
<br>
<p>The efficiency of cells is also affected by the amount of flux they are
<br>
receiving. For example, the GaAsAnt cells mentioned above are slightly
<br>
more efficient in space than on earth, and reach their peak efficiency
<br>
in a natural gas furnace, converting the highly concentrated IR energy
<br>
of natural gas flames to electricity for a unique hybrid electric car
<br>
that Washington State University was developing in the mid-90's. The 34%
<br>
efficiency exceeded (and total 24% efficiency) of the test vehicle the
<br>
14-18% efficiency typical of IC autos.
