<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Has anyone demonstrated then that any mutation induced in any species is

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; POC
</em><br>
<p>Mutations in response to changed conditions are demonstrated as well
<br>
as could be; there's a great sequence of sequential mutations in French
<br>
mosquitos responding to insectide.  We can also identify selected
<br>
regions; Wu's lab showed a section of Drosophila chromosome with
<br>
meiotic drive has had at least 5 selective sweeps.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Is Darwinian evolution a dogma and part of the catechism of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Scientism? (Unless you give the expected answer to this religious question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you won't pass Geology 100). Doesn't it depend on millions of successful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;adaptive mutations in the wild to be valid? Why can't genetics labs after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;so many years come up with any? Where are the hard fossil records of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;huge number of failed mutations? Bone mutations should be failing out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;there left, right and centre and leaving a fossil trail behind.
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, they are.  Every bone we ever find is different.  Although we can't
<br>
yet specifically identify the individual genes responsible, we know that
<br>
there is a lot of genetic variation behind that variability; plenty for 
<br>
Darwinian
<br>
evolution.  Actually the current problem is more explaining why it's so
<br>
slow in the long-term sense; models suggest it should always run at the
<br>
rate of the apparent punctuations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Why do all the grasshopers and boll weevils have legs and not wheels?
</em><br>
Not enough knowledge of development to answer that one.
<br>
We don't see how they could evolve, but we don't under-
<br>
stand everything about development, by a long shot.  
<br>
Could also be that wheels demain nice hard flat surfaces
<br>
for efficiency and such things are not common apart from
<br>
human agency.
