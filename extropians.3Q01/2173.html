</em><br>
<em>&gt; they slaughtered, rather than about how much money they made on their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newest software offering? Their shape of government appeared hundreds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of times, independently, naturally. It took literally thousands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years to develop the ideas necessary for capitalism to exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Capitalism is much better than &quot;natural&quot; - it works. &quot;Natural=good&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bad meme.
</em><br>
<p>Only if you claim that the 'natural' state was the dynastic feudalism of
<br>
that period. I don't.
<br>
<p>The animistic/naturalistic tribal paganism prior to the rise of highly
<br>
organized agriculture like that seen in the first civilizations is much
<br>
more representative of that state which we call 'natural', for it
<br>
endured not for a few thousand years, but for tens of thousands of years
<br>
back to the Heidelberg/Neanderthal period. Tribal cultures are actually
<br>
far more socially and economically egalitarian than most any other
<br>
social system (though I suppose the claim could be made that if everyone
<br>
is in the ditch, your relative position in the ditch is of little
<br>
consequence to those outside the ditch), and operate within and between
<br>
tribal units on a far more 'fair trade' Bayesian system.
<br>
<p>The animistic paganism of these early cultures eventually evolved as
<br>
tribes merged authority into organized agriculture into pantheistic
<br>
priesthoods that legitimized the holy authority of the kings beyond
<br>
their true legitimacy based on their real managerial capability, much as
<br>
collectivist ideologies today enforce dogma through propaganda and
<br>
punishment to maintain the authority of the state despite its lack of
<br>
real legitimacy based on economic efficiency. Both are unnatural
<br>
manipulations of preexisting systems through disinformation and lies.
