<br>
<p>Thanks for the interesting essay. Suppose we accept your analysis of the
<br>
etiology and your prescription for the ill, namely, a new age of
<br>
enlightenment in the middle east. I am not sure how you propose to get from
<br>
&quot;here to there&quot;. You suggest that we take Japan as the poster child for the
<br>
sort of transformation that we would like to see, but of course the changes
<br>
in Japan were instituted by a foreign military dictatorship. If the parallel
<br>
is to hold, western forces would have to institute a military dictatorship,
<br>
at least for a while. Is this what you are suggesting? If not, how are we
<br>
supposed to get the mideast from where they are now to where we would like
<br>
them to be? In effect, I think you are saying that we know best what is best
<br>
for them. (If not this only exacerbates the problem). You might even be
<br>
right about this, but still there is the problem of instituting what we
<br>
think is best for them. After all, saying that they are ignorant in this
<br>
respect is part of what they do not like about the west in the first place.
<br>
Any thoughts and getting from here to there? Mark
<br>
