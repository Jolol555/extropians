</em><br>
<p>Thanks for tackling the question head-on!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you really suppose all those 200,000,000 rich, middle-class

</em><br>
<p>Sorry, but you may be losing me.  See, I've thought about these
<br>
things, but didn't do any research or have many people to discuss
<br>
the ideas with.  So we are talking about a pittance here.  Okay,
<br>
so what's that?  Let's say $1000.  Yes, then if an adminstration
<br>
in the U.S. disbanded HEW, that would yield about $1000 per adult.
<br>
So that wouldn't result in any tax increase; but then, I'm thinking
<br>
that you are also in favor of a hefty tax increase.  Is this too
<br>
complicated?  Does one have to go to the economists that you refer
<br>
to in &quot;The Spike&quot; for further details, or is it still possible to
<br>
discuss it here?  After all, one has to guess at the post tax-hike
<br>
revenue, and the post GMI tax revenue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Remember also, that we have now learned (thanks to Chris Rauch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this morning 10:01am) that about one-fourth of the populace
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; would quit working within a year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aargh. Lee, Lee, do you really think there's no motivational distinction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between being assured of getting, say, $25,000 a year `Purple Wage' for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family of four (THE SPIKE, p. 249), and winning 10 million bucks in one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; joyous and often tax-free lump?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry.  Logical error on my part.  I should have remembered that
<br>
distinction, and that you were probably talking about something
<br>
smaller than I was thinking about (a pittance, it turns out).
<br>
Um, now does the typical lottery winner here get 10 million bucks?
<br>
The ones that I remember reading about usually have to settle for
<br>
a life-time guarantee of $100,000 a year or something.  By the way,
<br>
getting $1000 a year is approximately equivalent to the interest
<br>
earned on $20,000 (if there aren't any taxes).  Since we're just
<br>
talking ideas, do you have an idea of the value of the GI, say
<br>
in America, that you are talking about?
<br>
<p>I'll go on record as guessing that if we switched over tomorrow
<br>
to a GI of $10,000, without loss of other government benefits,
<br>
a lot of people (who have had a rough day, or who hate their
<br>
boss, or who are daunted at preparing their resume) would find
<br>
a way to live on it, and that we'd have, say, about a third of
<br>
the workforce quitting within five years.  Sound too pessimistic?
