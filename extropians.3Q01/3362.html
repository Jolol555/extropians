<em>&gt;&gt; Left-Liberal...

<em>&gt;&gt; Which clearly indicates problems with the test's methodologies.

<p><em>&gt;Please say more, and let the Advocates for Self-Government know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what you think.  They try very hard to make the test fair, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*do* make changes from time to time.
</em><br>
<p>Although socially I'm a libertarian, financially I should be on the
<br>
border between libertarian/conservative.
<br>
<p>I agreed that military service should be voluntary, when I was in
<br>
the Marines, I got unofficially stepped on for being published as
<br>
being against the draft. I can't imagine anything less free than
<br>
the draft. Being willing to put your life on the line is very
<br>
personnal, Heinlein understood. 
<br>
<p>I also felt the government has no business controlling media.
<br>
<p>I also feel the government has no business regulating sex, and
<br>
since marriage is a civil and not merely a religious institution,
<br>
it should be open to same sex partners. (I'm heterosexual in case
<br>
anyone's wondering, women are the most beautiful things on the
<br>
planet ;) ). 
<br>
<p>Drugs? Tax them and use the money to police/treat problems.
<br>
<p>The border issue is tougher, I believe nation states have a vested
<br>
interest in maintaining them (terrorists), I'm not a one world
<br>
government kind of guy, I'm a pluralist.
<br>
<p>Business and farms are on their own, nobody buying corn? plant
<br>
something else.
<br>
<p>Free trade just makes good economic sense. (and I'm Union!)
<br>
<p>Minimum wage is probably where I got nailed with the left/liberal
<br>
label. I support the idea of a minimum wage. Since capitalism left
<br>
unchecked can leave people in the dust, I see the need for a
<br>
minimum safety net. I think I could argue that this is actually in
<br>
a free markets best interest. This does not mean the government
<br>
should assume a paternal role. I think my late uncle Stan said it
<br>
best &quot;Nephew, some people need a helping hand now and again, and
<br>
others need a good swift kick in the ass.&quot; Sound Wisdom.
<br>
<p><p>Since I believe in a minimal government, I believe in minimal
<br>
taxes, actually I believe in everybody paying the same amount,
<br>
effectively a flat tax. People with kids in school should pay extra
<br>
for each kid. I'd be happy to kick in extra for
<br>
space/science/defense. So taxes and user fees are separate issues.
<br>
<p>Foreign aid.... This was a tool during the cold war to bribe people
<br>
to be on our side during the great global chess match. I do see the
<br>
need for government aid in time of emergency, but I think it is one
<br>
of those things individuals should finance either privately, or by
<br>
kicking in voluntarily on their taxes.
<br>
<p><p>Maybe my problem is the difference between the classical and the
<br>
modern versions of these terms.

<p><em>&gt;I'm not sure.  I pretty much thought that about you already --
