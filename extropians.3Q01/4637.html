<p>I find that really hard to believe.
<br>
I doubt that the situation in UK is much different to Oz. I know a number 
<br>
of public school teachers and they work incredibly hard.
<br>
<p>A while ago there were some truly stupid &quot;surveys&quot; done here in Oz in an 
<br>
attempt to &quot;prove&quot; that kids here are illiterate. They came up with figures 
<br>
that the conservatives used to do a lot of chest thumping, but it really 
<br>
wasn't true. All the kids I have met are bright as buttons. I wish that 
<br>
when I was their age I had learned some of the things these kids are 
<br>
learning now.
<br>
<p>It seems to be fashionable to heap shit on public schools these days.
<br>
<p>It makes me feel sad that some people feel so unconcerned at the thought of 
<br>
wiping away a whole segment of society. Don't they remember why public 
<br>
school exists? There is this waving of arms and saying &quot;Leave it to the 
<br>
magic of the free market -- that will fix it.&quot; But all it will fix is that 
<br>
the rich will have less tax to pay and the poor will go without 
<br>
education... and backwards we march to the bad old days.
<br>
<p>I am no fan of school (I was lucky enough to be born into a family where I 
<br>
was well-off and basically taught myself), but that doesn't mean I am blind 
<br>
to how it can bring opportunity to those who would otherwise miss out. Sure 
<br>
school can improve... it can *always* improve. But next time you feel 
<br>
tempted to dump on public school just have a look at what they *are* 
<br>
managing to teach kids these days.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
