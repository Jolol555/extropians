<p>
First, I want to thank Anders and Eliezer for making thoughtful
<br>
and considered responses to my previous suggestions.  Second,
<br>
I want to acknowledge Mark Walker for providing insight from
<br>
a philosophical perspective that I would have been unable to
<br>
provide.
<br>
<p>As Mark has suggested my reasoning is based on a very logical
<br>
&quot;consequentialist&quot; position.  Some of you may have have seen
<br>
the Star Trek Voyager episode where the holographic doctor
<br>
discovered that his program had been rewritten by the crew
<br>
so as to delete his memory of a previous incident.  During that
<br>
incident an attack occurred in which he had to make a choice
<br>
between saving 1 of 2 equally valuable lives.  Making an &quot;arbitrary&quot;
<br>
choice of saving Harry Kim led to a conflict in his ethical
<br>
subroutines that eventually drove him crazy.  The only solution
<br>
the crew could find at the time was to excise the memories of
<br>
the incident.
<br>
<p>I fear that I may have pushed some of the list members over the
<br>
edge with my suggestions creating an inherent conflict in their
<br>
ethical subroutines and for that I apologize.
<br>
<p>In medical terms what I may be considering is the process known
<br>
as &quot;triage&quot;, &quot;originally, the sorting of battle or disaster
<br>
casualties for those requiring immediate help, those who can wait,
<br>
and those beyond help&quot; [The New Lexicon Webster's Dictionary].  
<br>
One of the questions I am raising is &quot;Are there significant
<br>
fractions of humanity that are 'beyond help'?&quot;.  I hear a lot
<br>
of people who seem to be suggesting that nobody is 'beyond help'
<br>
but I fear that in reality, that may not be the case.
<br>
<p>Mark has also pointed out that Ander's perspective is framed
<br>
in &quot;deontological&quot; terms.  This sent me off to my big dictionary:
<br>
&quot;deontology&quot; n. the science of duty or moral oblication (fr.
<br>
Gk deon (deontos), obligation + logos, discourse].  This seems
<br>
to me to be correct.
<br>
<p>A simple way of looking at what was proposed is, &quot;*When* do the
<br>
needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one?&quot;.
<br>
Anders response would seem to be &quot;never&quot;, excepting perhaps cases
<br>
when one is being personally assaulted.
<br>
<p>Now, I realize that I was discussing a not so &quot;few&quot; people.
<br>
I also realize that it is not possible to set exact valuations
<br>
on the lives involved.  However setting values on lives and
<br>
their loss *is* something that courts, juries, armed forces
<br>
officers and fire and police company commanders are required
<br>
to do on a regular basis.  For example, assuming 5000 lives
<br>
at $50,000/yr over ~30 years gives a number of $7.5 billion
<br>
(even without doing a net present value calculation or considering
<br>
multiplier effects).
<br>
<p>I am probably digging my grave deeper here but I have to ask,
<br>
&quot;How many Afgani lives are worth $7.5 billion?&quot;.  A show I watched
<br>
yesterday indicated that Continental is laying of 13,000 employees.
<br>
This is going to ripple out to many economies around the world.
<br>
A global economic slowdown will &quot;trickle down&quot; to the third
<br>
world likely decreasing incomes of the poorest of the poor
<br>
resulting in increased deaths from hunger and starvation.
<br>
The money that the U.S. will be spending to combat terrorism
<br>
will be money that cannot be spent to combat AIDS in Africa
<br>
(something that was beginning to become a priority before last week).
<br>
<p>The point of all of this is to suggest that the Extropian Principles
<br>
may be incomplete or self-conflicting because I cannot look at them
<br>
and discover a clear path out of this situation.  I find myself
<br>
asking myself, &quot;Is it 'rational' to seek to preserve the lives
<br>
of people who prefer and propagate 'blind faith' and 'dogma'&quot;
<br>
whose clear agenda is to destroy one of the most open societies
<br>
on the planet today?&quot;
<br>
<p>One of the things that seems likely to happen (if it already hasn't)
<br>
is a removal of previous restrictions on the CIA from involving themselves
<br>
with people with &quot;dirty&quot; hands.  We seem to be returning to previous
<br>
&quot;conventional&quot; solutions, that from what I can see were, in large
<br>
part, responsible for creating the problem in the first place.
<br>
Who will we be training or funding to resolve the &quot;bin Laden&quot; problem
<br>
only to find them becoming the &quot;bin Laden&quot; of the next decade?
<br>
Because &quot;conventional thinking&quot; seems unlikely to resolve the
<br>
situation, I do not feel discussing &quot;unconventional&quot; solutions
<br>
is something that should be suppressed.
<br>
