<p>&lt;&lt; This is bogus, of course. Staying in LEO damages you, and not only due to
<br>
&nbsp;the noise and the chemical contamination. Monkeys are not built for space,
<br>
&nbsp;not even microgravity. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I suspect the Japanese will be 1st to go teleoperational on the moon, just 
<br>
because their tech literature seems to be more focused on that endeavor. 
<br>
Secondly, we haven't done any experiments with humans living in large 
<br>
inertial force (centrifugal) space stations or spaceships.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;So monkeys need their chance in the solar system too. That is, unless SI's 
<br>
or former humans (Exe's as Hans Moravec termed them), zoom through the solar 
<br>
system at massive speed. Even then, humans will want a jaunt, and Yes, we 
<br>
weren't built for zero-G, so we will have to build our spaceships and 
<br>
habitats to produce movement that will Trick the circulatory system, skeletal 
<br>
system, endocrine glands, and neurology to &quot;act&quot; as if it needs to resist 
<br>
Gravity.
<br>
<p>If those experiments Fail bigtime, at sustaining monkey-life, then I will 
<br>
concede that you are right, and its Robots or nothing. Until then, the Jury 
<br>
is still out, because we haven't run any significant experiments to indicate 
<br>
yes or no.
<br>
<p>Ape-like in all ways, Mitch
