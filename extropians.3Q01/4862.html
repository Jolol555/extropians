<p><em>&gt;I have nothing against private education, but it is not the solution to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;educational needs. Likewise free market economics can be extremely useful,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but there are definite limits to its usefulness.
</em><br>
<p>I basically agree with this.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure just what the gripe is on the other side. Is it that government
<br>
money for schools is a violation of our &quot;natural rights&quot; unless it is given
<br>
voluntarily? Or is it simply that the state school system is economically
<br>
inefficient?
<br>
<p>If anyone believes the former, I can't help you. We are getting into these
<br>
metaphysical doctrines that purist libertarians believe and which I reject.
<br>
<p>However, arguments based on economics are another story. I'm as fiscally
<br>
conservative and as alert to the practical advantages of competition and
<br>
individual decision making as most people.
<br>
<p>So, is there a way to redistribute money to the poorer people in the
<br>
community to pay for a good education for their kids, while keeping the
<br>
advantages of competition, decentralisation, etc, which Lee has extolled so
<br>
persuasively?
<br>
<p>When the question is asked this way, it seems to force us towards
<br>
considering some kind of voucher system. I've never been a great fan of
<br>
voucher systems below the tertiary education level, but I'm starting to
<br>
think this was just a (mildly) left-wing prejudice of mine. So let's make it
<br>
an open question. Could the left-liberals (as the Americans call them; I
<br>
think us Aussies, and probably the Europeans, would probably call them
<br>
social democrats) and the libertarians on the list discuss in an open-minded
<br>
way, without prejudice to our ultimate views, what would be the advantages
<br>
*and* disadvantages of a voucher system? Can we reach agreement that *if*
<br>
the state is going to fund education, this would be a better way? Or are
<br>
there genuine educational and economic problems? I think I can still see
<br>
some problems, but they may be surmountable.
<br>
