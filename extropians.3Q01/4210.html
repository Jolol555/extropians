Helen said
<br>
<p>___________________________________________________________________
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I was hoping somebody could help clear something up for me. I've just been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;looking at Max More's Phd thesis on self ownership, which I take is largley 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;part of the extropian philosophy. He says that the mind/body dualsim should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be usurped in favour of seeinng them as a whole, i.e. what effects the mind 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;also effects the body. But a lot of you on the list want to finally upload 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your minds - in effect becoming disembodied. How do you work this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contradition out? Anders, Natasha and More all seem to be suggesting the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;importance of the body to the self - but there are a majority of you who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want to forget the body altogehther and upload. I'm confused.
</em><br>
<p>____________________________________________________________________
<br>
<p>So I say... this opens up a lot of questions.
<br>
<p>However, some comments:
<br>
<p>(1) Speaking for myself, I have no interest in being uploaded and have real 
<br>
doubts about the pattern theory of identity, etc. To me, destructive 
<br>
uploading sounds like a high-tech form of death. You'd find some others here 
<br>
who share that view. It may even be the majority view.
<br>
<p>My greater interest is in radical life extension through biotechnology. I 
<br>
rather like my body; it just needs a good overhaul at the cellular level. 
<br>
Sure, if we can take powerful new computational technology into ourselves, 
<br>
well and good, but the immediate problem IMHO is to get the biotech to a 
<br>
level enabling 40y.o.+ people like me to make it in reasonable shape to the 
<br>
end of the new century. You'll see this priority reflected in my posts.
<br>
<p>And you'll probably find a lot of varied priorities on a list such as this.
<br>
<p>(2) Anyway, I don't see mind/body dualism as having anything to do with it. 
<br>
There'll always have to be some kind of material, or at least physical, 
<br>
substrate. Anyone who thinks you can run a conscious personality on a 
<br>
computer substrate is probably some kind of materialist in his/her 
<br>
philosophy of mind, or something awfully close to it. David Chalmers' 
<br>
attenuated version of dualism is compatible with computer consciousness, but 
<br>
*despite*, rather than because of, the dualistic element. The belief that 
<br>
uploading is associated with mind/body dualism is one of the common and 
<br>
important mistakes made by external commentators on transhumanist and 
<br>
cyberpunk ideas. I hear it often from lazy literary academics who think they 
<br>
can critique all these ideas with the banal insight that it is all Cartesian 
<br>
dualism. Ho, hum. This is a metaphor in search of a concept. In your case, 
<br>
though, thank you for seeking clarification, rather than rushing headlong 
<br>
&lt;g&gt;.
<br>
<p>(3) Having said that, I am slightly less ferocious about point (2) than I 
<br>
used to be (I once savaged Margaret Wertheim's _The Pearly Gates of 
<br>
Cyberspace_ over this and other things), because I've come see that there is 
<br>
an element of longing to escape bodily experience among *some* 
<br>
transhumanists. Max More makes this point in one of his papers. Still, I 
<br>
don't share any such longing and I don't see it in any of the important 
<br>
thinkers. Nor do I see it in the cyberpunk fiction of, say, William Gibson. 
<br>
People like Wertheim and the army of academic critics who think they 
<br>
understand Gibson are *not* trustworthy on these issues.
<br>
<p><p>Off topic, but glancing at your other e-mail, I'm damned if I know what to 
<br>
make of Donna Haraway and other such &quot;cyborg&quot; or &quot;posthuman&quot; theorists. To 
<br>
me, they're barking up the wrong tree, not realising that the important 
<br>
issues for the new century relate to the *literal* possibilities of 
<br>
enhancement, extreme longevity, etc. All this stuff about the cyborg as a 
<br>
kind of analogue or symbol for the identity politics of feminism, gay rights 
<br>
etc, is beside the point. Mind you, I am all in favour of social diversity, 
<br>
experiments in living, etc, so I strongly support the &quot;rights&quot; (&quot;rights 
<br>
talk&quot; is nonsense on stilts but reasonable shorthand here) of gays, polys 
<br>
and so on. But that is within a worldview where I also want freedoms that 
<br>
will enable radical enhancements of the body - quite literally.
<br>
<p>Others can speak for themselves. I think I'm expressing one fairly common 
<br>
transhumanist view, but I've found that there are a lot of views floating 
<br>
around on this list that I don't share. So I'm no spokesman for the 
<br>
extropians.
<br>
<p>Over to the list.
<br>
<p>Cheers
<br>
<p>Russell
