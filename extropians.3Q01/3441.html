<p><em>&gt; The problem, Lee, is that we are *all* racists.
</em><br>
<p>Don't you worry that you are robbing the term of any utility whatsoever?
<br>
It is very useful, IMO, to describe those people who pre-judge people
<br>
to the extent that they cannot be open-minded, for those people who 
<br>
believe that a person's race is far and away the most important characteristic
<br>
of him or her, and for those who believe in some sort of magical necessity
<br>
of people from a certain demographic gene pool to be always inferior along
<br>
some measure.  As an adjective, &quot;racist&quot; can also be used to characterize
<br>
statements or positions that would attempt to maintain one of the aforementioned
<br>
beliefs.  (Observe that white-separatists need not be racist by this usage.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is virtually impossible to have been born and raised in the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without being a racist.
</em><br>
<p>In what large society would it be possible for people to be born and
<br>
raised without being a racist?  (I am not trying to make a point; I
<br>
am interested in your opinion about the existence of such a place.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is in part a social problem and in part an evolved defense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanism.  The less like &quot;us&quot; a given person or group of persons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, the more likely we are to view them with suspicion and caution.
</em><br>
<p>I believe that this is a part of the genetic heritage of most humans,
<br>
and probably most primates, if not some larger biological grouping.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not necessarily a bad thing in and of itself.  But when that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instinct is not tempered by a willingness to consider the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility that the &quot;different&quot; person is not so bad as our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gut reactions tell us, then our rationality is being trumped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by animal instinct. 
</em><br>
<p>Exactly so.
<br>
