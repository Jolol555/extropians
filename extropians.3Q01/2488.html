Unfortunately true, I know someone who just spent ten day on jury duty
<br>
without pay (had to take it out of vacation time) on a domestic abuse case
<br>
where the wife did not want to prosecute, the husband may have lost his job
<br>
due to the case, the evidence showing she was battered was a photo looking
<br>
like she was going out for dinner (no marks at all). The only ones wanting
<br>
the case was the prosecutor and a domestic abuse agency (most likely federal
<br>
funded). And this was the second time, the first time it ended up in a split
<br>
jury, this time it was not guilty. Your tax dollars at work. On top of that
<br>
the courthouse was a viral cesspool and my friend picked up a summer flu
<br>
which he gave to me and I have been running a fever for 4 week.
<br>
<p>This was really judicial abuse.
<br>
<p>Best
<br>
