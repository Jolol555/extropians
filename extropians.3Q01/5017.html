<p>
I am a bigot sometimes. There's some things I like and some things I
<br>
don't like. I do not agree it is necessary to rid the world of all
<br>
discrimination, or even bigotry. How does one define bigotry: from the
<br>
perspective of the person exhibiting the bigotry or those who don't like
<br>
what he says? Any person who expresses an authoritarian position will on
<br>
occasion appear as a bigot. I do not agree moral arguments and posturing
<br>
made by victims should always and unconditionally be honored.
<br>
<p>The world is a giant intellectual delicatessen. There is nothing which
<br>
says what a person should think or believe. We each make of it whatever
<br>
we want. Rather than say what things should be, I have come to enjoy the
<br>
variation I see, and if possible understanding functionality which
<br>
supports some of that variation.
<br>
<p>If I must choose a single moral premise to advocate it would be to &quot;be
<br>
rational&quot; or think, and it would be without qualification what those
<br>
thoughts should be as good or evil.

<em>&gt;David McDivitt (who is the original poster, new to this list)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; When I have such debates, they sometimes reduce to me asking a person to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; show why he is not a bigot, authoritarian, or fascist, and him asking me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; why I refuse to accept certain common values as absolute.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, I'm with you here.  I believe that there really are such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things as bigotry, authoritarianism, harmful condescension,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;collectivism, racism, inconsistency, lack of compassion, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arrogance, and unfairness, and that they should be exposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and demonized.  (By the way, I thought you were a nominalist?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I agree morality exists. I just do not agree it is always
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the same, or must always be the same.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No.  I can't agree that we should agree to say that morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exists---that's really going too far.  It clearly all comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;down to what people approve of and what they don't approve of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If we attempt to get precisely factual, we simply cannot appeal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to &quot;moral laws&quot;, or &quot;rights&quot; (except legal ones), or any of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that stuff unless it's clearly shorthand for &quot;I approve&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;I disapprove&quot;.  The purpose of showing someone that he or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;she is arrogant, or lacks compassion, or is a fascist is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make him or her feel bad.  By **their** own semantic links
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and real connection to the world and to other individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the world, and their own conscious (and unconscious) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unavoidable judgments of others, if one can show a sufficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt;real similarity, his or her own conscience will be activated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
