<p><em>&gt; As one who sees everything as 'simply matter and physics', I can also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stated that I most certainly don't think that doing so eliminates value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or values or the sacredness of anything. This, I find, is a primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fault of those who wax excessively about religion and spiritualism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claiming that science is no better than another superstition. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot imagine the possibility that the universe can be looked at in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely rational manner while simultaneously having a sense of awe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and wonder at it. They also have extreme difficulty imagining the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility that one could derive a set of values from objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational observation of the universe that is anything but a rather crass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and simplistic dog eat dog existence.
</em><br>
<p>I also have extreme difficulty imagining how one could derive a set
<br>
of values from rational observation of the universe, period.  I
<br>
believe that normal human beings come equipped with genes that
<br>
prejudice us towards a number of values, e.g., cooperation, altruism,
<br>
envy, and retribution, and sometimes when people &quot;discover&quot; that
<br>
almost everyone shares certain values, they go on to suppose that
<br>
these values are objective.  They're not.  The quickest way to see
<br>
that is to imagine aliens perhaps rather improbably derived from
<br>
quite different environments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is these cognitive failings in the religionists that I find most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; troubling,
</em><br>
<p>of course you mean *most* religionists
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and is what I meant earlier when I said they are lacking. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take great umbrage at the assertion that I lack in a sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aesthetics, that I don't appreciate beauty or human spirit, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I choose to look at the world rationally rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a position of superstition and supernaturalism. I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need religion to be spiritual, and I don't need supernatural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomena to feel at one with the universe.
</em><br>
<p>I find this quite clear (and I even agree), except for what you
<br>
mean by &quot;spiritual&quot;.  As you know, the term evidently means very
<br>
many different things to very many people.  Such terms, it seems
<br>
to me, might be better dropped from wide-ranging public discourse,
<br>
such as this list.
