</em><br>
<p><p>Several years ago I worked in a small office employing, by random
<br>
coincidence, a young Afghan woman who had been in Afghanistan during the
<br>
Russian invasion AND a young Russian man who had served two years in
<br>
Afghanistan as a soldier.  I knew both of them reasonably well (and dated
<br>
the girl briefly), so I have an interesting perspective on their first-hand
<br>
perspectives.
<br>
<p>1)  Most Afghans have developed a deep-seated antipathy towards the
<br>
Russians.  This is partly because the Russians committed atrocities on
<br>
occasion and people remember first-hand.  I don't think this is going to go
<br>
away anytime soon.
<br>
<p>2)  Most Afghans look very favorably upon the US.  Without the support of
<br>
American weapons and intelligence, they firmly believe that Afghanistan
<br>
would have collapsed relatively quickly under the Russian onslaught.  We
<br>
pulled their ass out of a fire and they remember us for that.
<br>
<p>3)  Calling the Afghanistan campaign &quot;The Soviet Vietnam&quot; is more apt than
<br>
most people realize.  That campaign was plagued by many of the same
<br>
political, social, and military problems that plagued the U.S. in Vietnam,
<br>
and was stopped after only 20,000 Soviet lives were lost (and millions of
<br>
Afghans dead).
<br>
<p>4)  Most Russians don't look disfavorably on Afghanistan; it was mostly an
<br>
embarrassing period for the Soviet Union and they have no specific dislike
<br>
of Afghans or Afghanistan.  It was a political failure rather than a
<br>
military one; the people making the decisions weren't the people fighting
<br>
the war.
<br>
<p><p>This was all pre-Taliban, but from all the Afghans I met, it seemed that
<br>
America held quite a bit of currency in the good will department and I doubt
<br>
this has changed much.  It would be a shame to spoil that.
