<em>&gt;From: Greg Burch &lt;<a href="mailto:gregburch@gregburch.net?Subject=Re:%20Letter%20to%20NPR%20re%20Duncan%20Moon's%209/18%20piece%20on%20Islamic%20reaction%20to%20the%20911%20attacks&In-Reply-To=&lt;F2506EKDqqDhOwdRMVk00001bb6@hotmail.com&gt;">gregburch@gregburch.net</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;  Third, it's a historical fact that Christianity has been largely &quot;tamed&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the sense that - outside of a few notable localized exceptions like N.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ireland, there are very few religiously-inspired wars being *initiated* by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Christians *on the basis of religion* these days.  Again, I'm open to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seeing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;examples to the contrary.  (There is a religious component to the Balkan
</em><br>
<em>&gt;violence, but it's just as much simple ethnic tribalistic bigotry as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religious hatred.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Fourth, there is absolutely no question in my mind that there is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;component of religious motivation in the 911 attacks and in the continuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;threat that Al Quaida and its co-conspirators continue to present to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;civilized world.  As I've said already, there are certainly non-religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;causes for conflict in and arising out of the Islamic world, from the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt;foreign policy decision to lie down with dogs in opposition to the Soviets
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in Afghanistan, to the intractable problem of Palestinian nationalism.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there is *no* component of US foreign policy error in the bloody violence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Islamic fundamentalists in Algeria, central Africa or Egypt, where wholly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;internal struggles are going on by them against their own domestic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;satans&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;i.e. non-fundamentalists and non-Muslims.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  So, yes, I'm singling out Islam. The Islamic world needs to do what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Europe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;did over the last 300 years.  It needs to tame its religion.  The sooner,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the better.
</em><br>
<p>I think if you look for it you will find it.  Although the middle east 
<br>
conflict is largely about self-governance and lebensraum for such peoples as 
<br>
the Palestinians, there is definitely a religious component to it.  The Jews 
<br>
believe in large part that they are providentially endowed to their 
<br>
&quot;promised land&quot; just as much as the Muslims feel the same way about the same 
<br>
land.
<br>
<p>But while the Palestinian struggle may be motivated in part by religious 
<br>
belief, I doubt that a Christian response would be any different if, say, 
<br>
the League of Nations decided to displace Americans in order to make a 
<br>
homeland for the American Indians, even though neither group necessarily 
<br>
feels endowed by their Creator to exclusive hegemony over North America.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
