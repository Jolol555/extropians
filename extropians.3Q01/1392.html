<p>Miriam, it is quite simple: what IS wealth? What IS money? It is a
<br>
symbol of value added by labor. Every dollar in the world represents
<br>
time from someone's life spent sweating their butt when they could have
<br>
been smelling the roses. Some people's ideas, decisions, and leadership
<br>
skills are immensely valuable, so some people make more money than
<br>
others.
<br>
<p>So the question is: in a society that abhors slavery, what is the
<br>
rationale for confiscating the labor of free individuals? I have yet to
<br>
hear anyone come up with an explaination why enslaving 100% of the
<br>
population 10% of the time is any less morally abhorrent than enslaving
<br>
10% of the people 100% of the time. If you can come up with a morally
<br>
and logically consistent answer to this, I am all ears. Nobody else has
<br>
to date.
<br>
<p>In a socialist society of any degree (social democracy or communist
<br>
totalitarian), the most productive individuals pay the largest
<br>
percentage of their labor to be given in services to the least
<br>
productive members, who contribute little or nothing to the services of
<br>
the whole. This may work fine in a family, which is an entirely
<br>
voluntary proposition for the productive members to engage in, but this
<br>
family economy cannot be extrapolated to society as a whole without
<br>
immense coersion by the force of the state, and therefore, is engaging
<br>
in slavery.
<br>
<p>I hear this 'it's for the children' excuse all the time, and I see
<br>
parents whining all the time irrationally &quot;I didn't ask to be a parent&quot;
<br>
(totally ignoring, of course, of the causal factors involved), and
<br>
expecting that I pay through income, property, sales, and other taxes,
<br>
for the cost of their stupidity. Guess what? I CAN say 'I didn't ask to
<br>
be a parent', because I'm not in the biological sense, but in the
<br>
economic sense, I sure am expected to be. Any attempt I make at avoiding
<br>
paying 'my fair share' is looked on with scorn, jealousy, and hate,
<br>
despite the fact that it should be I who has those feelings, and justly.
<br>
Just HOW do you justify my enslavement?
