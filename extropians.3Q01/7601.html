<p>Well, why do you think they would save money?  The medical profession.
<br>
like any other, charges whatever the market will bear.  Tumor removal,
<br>
whether at stage 2 or stage 4, is something that even if the charges
<br>
go up, the market will not change that much.
<br>
Why would finding a tumor 2 months earlier save the insurance cos  any
<br>
money in the long run? So if the hospitals/doctors can no longer get
<br>
on average 45K for a tumor because X percentage of tumors are now at
<br>
stage 2 instead of stage 4, then hospitals/doctors just increase the
<br>
price for stage 2 tumor removals.  They have the money to buy
<br>
corp-gov-media and so the status quo will not change...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In any case, I do have &quot;yuppie income and above&quot;, 
</em><br>
<p>Good for you! So do I.
<br>
However, 50% or more of American citizens do not, and perhaps they
<br>
would like to have similar opportunities.
<br>
<p>I guess the poor folks just need to start hanging some rich folks and
<br>
politicians until they start representing them again.
