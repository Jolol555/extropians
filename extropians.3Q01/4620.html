<em>&gt; &gt;Parents who parent do in fact pay for their own childrens'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;education, and then soldier on to pay the taxes that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;provide for the twelve years' warehousing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;indoctrination that the hinds' get gets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The notion that state schools benefit all segments of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;society because they provide universal literacy, knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of the historical basis of the culture, and understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of the mechanisms of citizen participation may have had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;some past relation with reality but these don't be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;days.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm no fan of public education.  Particularly the LAUSD and I'd rather eat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worms than send my kids to public school in L.A.  But there is a *large*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; segment of society that cannot afford to pay for the education of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kids.  If public school education were to be suddenly eliminated... well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would be the equivolent of saying &quot;let them eat cake.&quot;  And in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; event I would not send my kids to their private school unless they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accompanied by a contingent of armed guards.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, despite there being no such thing as a 'right to an education'
<br>
elucidated in the Constitution or in many state constitutions (though
<br>
some do). In many places like LA, public school is nothing but a daycare
<br>
center for the perpetually immature children of working and otherwise
<br>
distracted parents. It's no wonder they fight now to get daycare for
<br>
their pre-school kids as a right as well. As has been said about past
<br>
democratic systems, the surest sign of decline is when the masses figure
<br>
out they can vote to pay themselves largess from the public purse.
