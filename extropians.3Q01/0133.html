<p>Yes. Of course. What's more, if Brian Aldiss's originating short story
<br>
`Supertoys...' has any sustained relevance to the movie's plot/mood, it is
<br>
about the bitter irony of people behaving `like robots'. David, in his tale
<br>
(and its two sequels), *is* a robot uttering canned responses which can
<br>
elicit emotional responses from humans (who are equally canned, therefore,
<br>
or at least readily fooled); but what's more biting is the way his humans
<br>
repeatedly speak and act from motives that escape their understanding (as
<br>
do we all, imply Aldiss and his favorite analytical psychologists), that
<br>
are driven by templates no less `mechanical' than the subroutines driving a
<br>
pseudo-boy--ways captured inadvertently in the very rote phrases they use
<br>
to describe their feelings to themselves. 
<br>
<p>At its bleakest, then, it's not just about love and pain and joy and the
<br>
whole damned thing, it's about how love and pain and joy are hopelessly
<br>
compromised by the artifice of culture, especially of postindustrial
<br>
culture. Many of us might take exception to that view, but I suspect it is
<br>
what spoke to Kubrick in his glacial observer's stance.
