<p>&lt;&lt; Another time was when the US bombed Hanoi for Christmas. I still
<br>
&nbsp;remember the first few lines of the special report newscast, mentioning
<br>
&nbsp;'wave after wave of B-52 bombers'. He clapped and cheered. It was rare
<br>
&nbsp;to see him this animated. The link was formed:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Demonstrators = bad, bombing = good.

<p><p>Perspective. The United Stated waged its war in Indochina, unlike any other 
<br>
war, because of two reasons; mission slip, and the fear that we would 
<br>
stumbling into a war with nuclear armed China and possibly, the USSR. 
<br>
Demonstrators were more effective in the 1960s and early 70's, however our 
<br>
society has become less influenced by such activities in the last 25 
<br>
years-have you noticed?  The idea that the use of carpet bombing was more 
<br>
&quot;decisive&quot; was probably viewed as determined. This must have been more 
<br>
appealing rather then wallowing in Southeast Asia and doing nothing. 
<br>
<p>Being on the &quot;demonstrators' side; with  20/20 hindsight, let me say that we 
<br>
could have won the war, with 3 million more North Vietnamese dead, and 20 
<br>
million Chinese dead; possibly using nuclear bombs to eliminate Chinese 
<br>
intervention. But now we are speaking to a classic Phyhric Victory. But to 
<br>
may, on both sides, it seemed better to initiate action, rather then let the 
<br>
North Vietnamese dictate every action-which is what they did.
