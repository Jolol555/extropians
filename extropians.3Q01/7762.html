I said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The attacks on nuclear plants are a serious problem. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; obviously no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Government official has ever thought about an *intentionally initiated*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; crash. Imagine a Boeing 747, heading from Frankfurt to the USA is going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be hijacked and with the full load of fuel is flown at full speed
</em><br>
into
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Biblis containment. I bet the concrete shield will not withstand that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; impact.
</em><br>
<p>and Samatha answered
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I see a bunch of assertions.  Where are the facts?
</em><br>
<p>It`s almost impossible to provide decent &quot;facts&quot; concerning 747s and nuke
<br>
plants because in order to get decent data you would have to *do* it.
<br>
<p>The facts about Biblis security calculations: they were done in the
<br>
seventies when no one thought of a deliberate 747 crash. The concrete
<br>
containment is two feet thick, whereas more recently built plants have a
<br>
containment of six feet. But in Germany we have at least three nuke plant
<br>
with only two feet concrete containment. One of them is near Frankfurt, the
<br>
other is within the range of Hamburg. All expert said last week that it
<br>
would be insincere to claim those reators could be save when terrorists
<br>
attack. Those three nuke plants don`t have a chance when hit.
