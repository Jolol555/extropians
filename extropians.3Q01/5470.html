This issue is dominating the media here at the moment. It's a bloody
<br>
disgrace, no question about it.

<p><p>(BTW, I did not compose what's on the subject line - that was imported from
<br>
the source - &quot;as is.&quot;)

<br>
What a surprise to find an editorial in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer about
<br>
the Land of Oz.  You guys must be following the Clinton administration's
<br>
example (when the USA refused entry to Haitians, preferring to rescue
<br>
Cubans, instead).  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In view of the discussions we've been having lately about strange visitors
<br>
from other lands ... look! up on the horizon! - it's a boat! - it's a barge!
<br>
... it's TALIBAN!  
<br>

<br>
(Yet, I don't mean to make light of this, as this is truly sad.)

Shame on Australia 
<br>
<p>Friday, August 31, 2001
<br>
<p>SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER
<br>
<p>Since two years after the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, ships have been
<br>
required by international law to rescue passengers from sinking vessels.
<br>
<p>Arne Rinnan, captain of the Norwegian cargo ship Tampa, did just that when
<br>
he was alerted by the Australian Coast Guard that an Indonesian ferry
<br>
carrying 438 people was sinking in international waters.
<br>
<p>The captain rescued passengers and asked permission to off-load them,
<br>
required under the Convention on Refugees, in the nearest port, which is in
<br>
Australia. He says his ship is unseaworthy with so many people aboard.
<br>
<p>But the passengers were refugees fleeing Afghanistan's Taliban regime;
<br>
400,000 have fled in the past year. Australia, a big country with a tiny
<br>
population, refused permission to dock and sent troops aboard to prevent it.
<br>
Strife-torn Indonesia also said no.
<br>
<p>Australia should be ashamed of itself. This unconscionable replay of &quot;Ship
<br>
of Fools&quot; is both cruel and dangerous. It sends the unacceptable message to
<br>
ship captains that it's best not to get involved rescuing people from
<br>
sinking ships.
