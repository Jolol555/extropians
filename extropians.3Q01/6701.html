</em><br>
<p>This is a good point. The Taliban and Bin Laden are not popular at all
<br>
among the Afghans, since they are essentially the Jerry Falwells of the
<br>
islamic world and does indeed oppress people awfully (they are likely
<br>
far more popular among people not living under their rule). There is a
<br>
very real reason why there is so much fighting over there.
<br>
<p>This suggests that helping the Afghans to cast off their fanatic rulers
<br>
would be worthwhile - we would get a lot of allies. One approach would
<br>
be to dump rugged communications equipment across the land, like the
<br>
wind up radio that was mentioned earlier. That would
<br>
make it easier for the oppressed to communicate, undermining the rule of
<br>
the Talibans (who seem sincerely opposed to any form of uncontrolled
<br>
communications). The ideal would be a wind-up satelite phone, but it
<br>
might be hard to get enough of those in a short time. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just dont yet know how to get the message to them that there really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really are no houris waiting, that houris were invented by some cowardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cleric to convince the young men to lay down their lives for a political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause, while the clerics enjoy the *real* virgins at home in this life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do we break it to them?  spike
</em><br>
<p>I don't think those houris are the main reason (the whole list seems to
<br>
have gotten them on their collective brains :-). After all, most
<br>
christians today (including many otherwise fundamentalistic types) don't
<br>
think Heaven is a literal city with streets paved with gold sitting on a
<br>
cloud, right? Instead they believe the rewards would be just as good or
<br>
better than those houries, Allah will surely have a great imagination
<br>
when it comes to rewards. So what you should try to undermine is the
<br>
martyrdom meme, that being a martyr is a great thing. Part of this is
<br>
memetic, part of it is economical: if you have nothing to lose, and your
<br>
family will become honored and cared for, then martyrdom might feel
<br>
worth it. 
<br>
<p>I think the idea of dropping Q'rans with commentary from islamic
<br>
scholars is a good idea. If we could get Al Azar university in Cairo to
<br>
proclaim a correct islamic denunciation of the deed, with the
<br>
accompanying analysis of the theology involved, that would have a
<br>
tremendous effect in the islamic world and help undermine the taliban
<br>
and others. But it has to be a correct, unbiased legal-theological
<br>
analysis to work, not just something ordered by the US or Egyptian
<br>
government.
