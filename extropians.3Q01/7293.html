<p>
Unquestionably true. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. The name did make
<br>
my eyebrows go up, even while I was carried on waves of emotion...
<br>
<p>I repeat that it is CRITICAL that all civilians speak loudly and insistently
<br>
the moment their ideological &quot;ornery, cantankerous individualist&quot; tripwires
<br>
go off. Say what you will about David Brin; he is right that we've been being
<br>
fed this ideal in our milk, so to speak. Our popular media has suspicion of
<br>
authority seething through it. Not the news, true; but action movies speak louder,
<br>
<p>Time to walk the walk. Carefully. Thoughtfully. Resolutely. Time to pay attention
<br>
to what really counts.
<br>
<p>This includes rolling back evil laws, to free up attention for the main event.
<br>
<p>Every thinking person has to build a piece inside that is an H. L. Mencken, or
<br>
a Gen. Smedley Butler (retired), and check in with that piece often.
<br>
<p>My motto: &quot;No Horseshit.&quot;
<br>
<p>You see, in the vernacular of that part of the Midwest where I grew up.
<br>
horseshit means &quot;unacceptably substandard&quot; (in more modern parlance, &quot;cheesy&quot;
<br>
comes close to the same meaning). Bullshit, of course, means  &quot;that which is not so&quot;.
<br>
<p>Horseshit, in contrast, is what's so, but shouldn't be.
<br>
<p>Time to pick up the shovel and clean out the barn. We don't have time to enforce
<br>
horseshit laws. Pick your favorite, and make some noise--along with doing your
<br>
other patriotic duties.**
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Or _if it's really important_ and you have the guts,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just ignore stupid laws, and when someone calls you on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it, tell them there's a war on. May we all choose wisely.
<br>
<p>We are members of the finest civilization ever to grace the planet. We should
<br>
act as if we were--in every sense of the phrase.
<br>
<p>MMB
