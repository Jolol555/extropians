<em>&gt; &gt; Are there sound, scientific, a priori reasons for saying that there are no

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jared Diamond gave an excellent argument as to why we should expect Europeans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be genetically less intelligent than Native Americans, many Africans, New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Guinea highlanders, and aborigines.  For millennia Europeans have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farmers, with their survival not terribly limited by intelligence.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primary cause of death was disease, meaning that the primary selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressure was for disease resistance.
</em><br>
<p>Except that diseases typically cause high fevers, which themselves can
<br>
cause brain damage, thus a high disease environment created a
<br>
simultaneous selection pressure for people who can retain their
<br>
intelligence even after suffering from x many fever causing diseases in
<br>
life. This would invariably cause greater brain evolution than not
<br>
living under such conditions.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, I don't see in Diamond's book where he said what you
<br>
attribute to him. Is it in another publication of his?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The other groups mentioned, as hunter-gatherers (or mixed farmers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foragers) actually had to think about finding their food: learn about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countless varieties of plants (witch knowledge in Europe), ditto for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animals, along with behavior, breeding and migration patterns, and tracks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stupidity would have a strong correlation with collecting less food, which in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a small group would be obvious, and would probably lead to having fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children, at least for males.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, Europeans had the same behavior until only a few millennia ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But with &quot;being ravaged by plague&quot; replacing &quot;need brains to gather food&quot; at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly intense level, we could expect some decline in European intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due to random drift.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The same could be said of many Asian peoples, only even more so, since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chinese for example have been agricultural and plague-ridden for longer than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; northwest Europeans.
</em><br>
<p>Which reflects my statement about disease incidence providing selection
<br>
pressure FOR intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also leading to the conclusion that my Irish ancestors should have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetically smarter than my Jewish ones, the Mideast invented agriculture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first.
</em><br>
<p>The mideast was exposed to more disease for far longer than Ireland.
<br>
Smallpox originated somewhere on the Assyrian/Indian trade routes back
<br>
in the second millenia BC. Furthermore, one must distinguish between
<br>
types of agriculture: herding and farming. Those involved in herding are
<br>
more likely to be exposed early on to disease, since most diseases
<br>
resulted from DNA trading between virii and bacteria typical of human
<br>
and domesticated animals (i.e. the &quot;Spanish Flu&quot; of the 1920's for
<br>
example, was the result of crossing over of swine flu virus DNA to human
<br>
flu virii, and the smallpox virus is thought to have evolved from its
<br>
harmless cowpox cousin, which was used as the first smallpox vaccine).
<br>
<p>Since the hebrews were herders for most of their history, nomadic or
<br>
otherwise, it stands to reason that they would be under greater
<br>
selection pressure from diseases for greater brain complexity than an
<br>
Egyptian or Assyrian farmer whose life focus is on wheat or oats with
<br>
only a few domesticated animals used for labor saving purposes.
