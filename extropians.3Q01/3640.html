<p>Actually, no, it's not, or maybe it is for large cities. In my
<br>
experience, big city people are far more polite in face to face
<br>
situations, but also far more bigoted when in more homogenous
<br>
situations. While Seattle area people are generally polite to a fault,
<br>
and freindly, they are far less gracious about others when among trusted
<br>
confidants. Among the Laurelhurst crowd I knew when I lived there, the
<br>
Rainier Valley, for instance, was commonly referred to as 'brown town',
<br>
while at the same time exhibiting any sort of racial bias in public was
<br>
considered very outre. The Mercer Island crowd was much the same, and
<br>
breathed sighs of relief every day that the trip over the bridge was a
<br>
long haul across the lake.
<br>
<p>At the same time, it was quite popular, and publicly acceptable, to poke
<br>
fun at the working class Norwiegian folk that populate Ballard (a North
<br>
Seattle neighborhood). The local tv comedy show, Almost Live, featured a
<br>
frequent skit called &quot;The Ballard Driving School&quot;, which required you to
<br>
drive a Dodge Dart, with the seat belt dragging on the ground, the
<br>
muffler dragging and smoking, while wearing a cheap eskimo jacket and
<br>
Toq, and the 'Uff Da' bumper sticker was mandatory. This was apparently
<br>
the stereotypical Norwiegian Ballardite driver.
<br>
<p>This show also stereotyped the camaro-driving Renton white redneck, with
<br>
his long hair in back and buzzcut on top, snorting coke while
<br>
complaining about crack gangs, etc...
