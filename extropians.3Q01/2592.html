<em>&gt; The more I learn about the singularity, the more puzzling the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept becomes to me.  I realized I had misunderstood the term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity when I saw Eli's definition as the point when machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence exceeds human intelligence.  It is not clear to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the accelerating bootstrapping process would automatically occur,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if we get a super-capable machine.  I suppose it is because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am failing to understand machine *motivation*.  I understand what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivates humans, but I am at a loss to explain what would motivate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a machine.  spike
</em><br>
<p>I may be confused, but I'm not sure that this was the original meaning of
<br>
the term singularity.  I think some people have decided that AI will be the
<br>
soonest and most likely cause of the singularity, so they decided that the
<br>
term most likely refers to AI.
<br>
<p>I think the term originally was more generic.  Any exponential growth curve
<br>
soon becomes almost vertical.  This vertical line approaches infinity going
<br>
straight up.  It becomes impossible to predict what exists after that wall
<br>
of vertical/infinite rate is reached.  I believe that this generic
<br>
description was the original meaning of the term.  This generic infinite
<br>
growth could come about with self-modifying AI, runaway nanotechnology,
<br>
uploading of the entire universe into a simulation, a sudden change in the
<br>
simulation, the advent of a true religion, strange matter destroying the
<br>
universe, the Big Crunch, etc.
<br>
<p>Does anybody else have memory of an earlier, more generic meaning for the
<br>
term singularity?  Am I having false memories, or is my mind-wipe fading?
<br>
