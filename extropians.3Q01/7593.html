<p>HMOs and insurance companies could reasonably want to see monitoring 
<br>
technologies become more widespread, as a way of lowering their costs, much 
<br>
as HMOs subsidize the cost of health club memberships.  Early detection can 
<br>
save them many thousands per patient in treatment costs.
<br>
<p>In any case, I do have &quot;yuppie income and above&quot;, and am willing to pay 
<br>
bucks for something with a good cost/benefit ratio, whether my insurance 
<br>
will cover it or not.  And some of these things aren't that expensive.  For 
<br>
$170, you can get a watch that monitors your EKG and triggers an alarm if 
<br>
your pulse goes either too high or too low.
