<p><em>&gt; Now, the question is: are we going to need AI abuse

</em><br>
<p>I believe (with absolutely no supporting data) that
<br>
this is a non existent problem.
<br>
<p>To explain why I believe this, I'll have to be a bit
<br>
long winded (sorry).
<br>
<p>First, why is domestic violence a problem?  Violence
<br>
among family units takes place in non human species
<br>
all the time, yet it isn't seen as a problem.
<br>
<p>I believe that the real problem lies not in the
<br>
violence itself, but in how it affects humans.
<br>
<p>I think we can agree that the effects of domestic
<br>
violence can be devastating to an individual's ability
<br>
to survive and flourish... but that is looking at it
<br>
from an entirely human viewpoint.
<br>
<p>I don't believe an AI would be entirely human.  Pain
<br>
will not be experienced in the same way and ego, self
<br>
worth, self esteem etc. will not be subject to the
<br>
same reactions and defensive strategies.
<br>
<p>Imagine a trans or post human in a synthetic body with
<br>
constant upload maintaining a back-up of their
<br>
identity... add in the ability to control pain and
<br>
control whatever endocrine system analogue
<br>
exists(conscious control of emotional state)... being
<br>
subject to domestic violence.  
<br>
<p>Since destruction of that particular housing for the
<br>
personality doesn't equal non-existence and the
<br>
negative emotions engendered by experience pain can be
<br>
controlled, domestic violence will not have a
<br>
devastating affect on such a person.
<br>
<p>I don't believe that an AI will be less capable of
<br>
reacting sanely to violence than a trans or post
<br>
human... and isn't the real damage done by domestic
<br>
violence the les-than-sane reactions it causes in
<br>
humans?
<br>
<p>Anyway... on my list of things to worry about, this
<br>
one doesn't even make it on the bottom.
<br>
