<em>&gt;As humans change, the definition of what is human

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thus you are correct, there are no transhumans around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;today (for any value of &quot;today&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>Strictly speaking, good definitions don't change that easy. For example:
<br>
Human = Homo sapiens + Technology + Society
<br>
The definition stays the same even though the parts evolve.
<br>
<p>Moving on, the most general definition of &quot;posthuman&quot; is a human so radically
<br>
changed that it is no longer a human. (Note: the direction of change is not
<br>
important, even a dead person is posthuman, hence the word &quot;posthumous&quot;).
<br>
According the definition of human, change can either be biological, technological,
<br>
or social. Reversing aging or uploading counts as posthuman, as would any near
<br>
omnipotence/omnipresence/omniscience technology. But also an all-out libertarian
<br>
society (or borg collective for that matter).
<br>
<p>So far anyone seems to agree (i hope). Transhumanism is the awareness or affirmation
<br>
of the transition to posthumanity (and as Natasha points out, the transition is from
<br>
being human to being posthuman). And a transhumanist is simply a person with such an
<br>
awareness.
<br>
<p>The question now is where to put the word &quot;transhuman&quot;. Some seem to equate
<br>
&quot;transhuman&quot; with &quot;posthuman&quot;, or at least &quot;partal posthuman&quot;. Others with
<br>
&quot;transhumanist&quot;. I dont think these put the term to optimal use. (funny note:
<br>
although &quot;transhumanist&quot; works perfect as a Swedish word, it is impossible find
<br>
a good translation for &quot;transhuman&quot;, very annoying).
<br>
<p>I like the definition from the transhuman art site, that states that transhuman
<br>
is the *process* of becoming posthuman. It consists of one or more sub-processes
<br>
of biological/technological/social nature. The definition combines well with the
<br>
that of &quot;process&quot; used in software by e.g. Rational(tm): A process is a template for
<br>
transforming requirements into a working system, within the context of a project.
<br>
<p>Another distinction between transhumanist and transhuman is that of leadership vs
<br>
management, or thinker vs doer. You can be a transhumanist without being a transhuman,
<br>
and vice versa. Also, I'd rather say that there have been transhumans around since
<br>
the beginning of man.
