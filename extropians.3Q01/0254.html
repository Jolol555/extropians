<p>Declan:
<p>My own take on AI. Feel free to post or not, but please note SPOILERS
INVOLVED.  ..bruce..
<p>================================================================================
AI: A Horrific Fairy Tale for Adults
<p>[SPOILERS BELOW]
<p>I have been fascinated by some of the sharp divisions of opinion
surrounding AI as reviews (official and un-) have come out in the past few
weeks. Today, my wife Sandra, our 18-year-old daughter Crystal, and I all
went to see the 12:00 noon showing at the Uptown here in DC (enormous
screen, great theatre). I believe that Crys was entertained but not
particularly moved. Sandra and I--who between us have 9 kids from our
separate prior marriages--both felt as though we had had a dentist with
sharp, tiny, hand-held instruments working on our hearts for 2 1/2 hours,
with pauses to let us recover, only to dig in again. Why the difference?
Because we're parents and she's not. And therein, I think, lies much of the
great divide.
<p>AI is not hard SF. It is a cautionary horror story cum fairy tale cum myth,
probably one of the best examples since Mary Shelley penned _Frankenstein,
or The Modern Prometheus_. It takes a simple premise--what if we could
teach a machine to love as a child loves, to think as a child thinks, and
to want to be loved as a child is loved?--and carries it through to some
excruciating, non-obvious and unflinching consequences that, I suspect,
resonate primarily with parents who have had children of that age.
As with Frankenstein, the core of AI involved hubris, temptation,
rejection, and consequences. Hubris was the unthinking arrogance of Dr.
Hobby and associates in tampering with the ecology of family and love
without due regard for the unintended consequences--set, ironically,
against a backdrop of melted icecaps (frankly, my first clue this wasn't
hard SF) and other unintended consequences of meddling with the physical
ecology at large.
<p>Temptation was Monica, watching her flesh-and-blood son Martin in cryonics
for five years, not knowing whether a cure would ever be found for him
(another fairy tale/myth motif), now being confronted with a machine,
called David, that looks like a little boy, that--if and when she says the
magic words--will fall eternally in love with her. Monica has a void inside
which remains gaping and unhealed because of Martin's suspension between
life and death, which is what makes her temptation so real. In far too many
movies and novels, the key temptation is so stupid and the consequences so
obvious that I lose most or all sympathy for the character (e.g., King's
_Pet Sematary_). What made this movie so painful for me was how realistic I
felt the temptation was. If I had one child, frozen, near death, with no
clear prospect of ever having him/her back and no prospect of ever having
another--yes, I might be tempted, and I think my wife even more so, to have
something like David to fill that void, and we would stumble into the trap
without realizing what we've done.
<p>Rejection comes with the realization of the artificial, unnatural aspect of
the relationship. Children grow; they mature (usually); there is always a
bittersweet aspect to losing the simple, passionate love of a child,
especially once they become brain-dead adolescents ;-), but one wishes
children to grow and go out on their own. Kubrick/Spielberg first carefully
lay out the slowly-unfolding hell of having a child-like automaton with
real feelings stuck at that particular emotional age, then accelerate and
compound that hell by bringing back the real child, warts and all. Can one
love a machine when one's own flesh and blood is at hand? What are our
loyalties, our instincts? Martin's and David's reactions to each other are
very believable (speaking particularly as someone who has had experience
merging two sets of kids together into one family), as are frankly the
different reactions to the situation between and her husband Henry (with
whom, remember, David has _not_ bonded; a classic parent/step-parent
divide, one with strong Oedipal/Freudian overtones). Martin is less
pleasant, less pure in his love, less physically perfect, less lovable--but
his is Monica and Henry's flesh, their progeny; having nearly lost him
once, can they reject him in favor of something that runs off electric
current, something manufactured? What would that say about them as humans,
as parents? Yet David really loves Monica, and she has to choose between
him and the rest of her very-human family.
<p>Whatever the twists and turns of the future projected, the emotional
consequences for all involved, but particularly for David, are as
inexorable as they are logical. For me, one of the most haunting lines of
the film is when Monica abandons David in the forest (another classic fairy
tale touch), shouting cautions even as she does so, then pauses and
says--as her final words to him--&quot;I'm sorry I never told you about the
world.&quot; There's a deep, wrenching stab at any parent's heart, capturing the
twin heartbreaks of forcing a child out into the world, away from the
safety comfort of a parent's arms (with a loss of security) and into all
the pain and cruelty and tragedy that the child is likely unprepared for.
<p>David then embarks on a classic, almost Campbellian fairy tale quest,
complete with faithful sidekick (Teddy) and rogue knight (Joe). He's off to
see the wizard (Dr. Know), to win the Sphinx-like riddling challenge and
find out what he needs to know to become a real boy so that Monica will
love him. But unlike the comforting, Disneyized fairy tales we've come to
accept, this one holds to the hard truth--there is no blue fairy, David
will never become a real boy, and Monica will never love him the way he
loves her, the way he so desperately wants to be loved, as someone unique
and irreplaceable--and this is where it is most wrenching. David's hopes
are raised to their highest peak by the mysterious message in the Dr. Know
booth and its literal unfolding as he and Joe travel to the 'ends of the
earth'--and then they are utterly smashed as he finds what lies at the end
of his quest. His homicidal (robocidal?) rage at finding another, duplicate
David is chilling and utterly consistent, calling to mind Henry's
seemingly-overblown worry much earlier in the film that &quot;If he [David] is
capable of love, then he is also capable of hate.&quot; And then all his hopes
are utterly crushed as he discovers that he himself is merely a simulacrum
of Hobby's own dead son David, and that he is being mass produced for human
consumption. It leads to two attempts at suicide, one out of despair, and
one based on obsession with his goal leading to indifference to everything
else, trapped in a dark prison of his own making.
<p>Some have objected to the third part of the movie, yet I think it was very
much keeping in spirit with the old-style fairy tales and myths. It has the
irony of robot survival and human extinction (brought on, with further
irony, by a profound ice age). It has the resurrection motif, with
acceptance into the company of gods or near-gods, not as an equal, but as
an honored icon (much as Greek gods elevating heroic mortals to Olympus or
into the constellations). And, as gods, they grant not what David wants but
what they can--a single day with Monica (Clarke's third law should be
enough to deal with any quibble about DNA), with no competition from Dad or
Martin or from the world at all. Again the Oedipal/Freudian overtones may
seem a bit blatant, but it's still utterly true to life, for a child of
that emotional age, as to what heaven would be. And David's choice--that he
would rather have that one day, with the increased sense of irrevocable
loss afterwards, than not to have it at all--goes to the heart of vast
numbers of myths and tales about what is so essentially human. Indeed,
David for all intents and purposes now _is_ the human race. And as the day
ends and Monica passes away, David--for the first time in his 2000-year
existence--sleeps and dreams.
<p>But does he wake?
