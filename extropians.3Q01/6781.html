When we start counting lives as if they are just counters in
<br>
some game and nothing else we welcome and create a Holocaust
<br>
scenario where all of those opposed to our great plan for the
<br>
good of all are seen as expendable and the sooner and more
<br>
efficiently expended, the better.  This is utterly morally wrong
<br>
and cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, lead to a better
<br>
world for the survivors.  
<br>
<p>The 50,000,000 / year are people dying already of causes mostly
<br>
unrelated to anything the Taliban or other groups are doing. 
<br>
Wiping out such groups (if you could) would at most have
<br>
marginal effect on speeding up technological progress to
<br>
eliminate those 50 megadeaths that are the current annuals
<br>
status quo.  But it would have huge effects on the opinion and
<br>
conscience of all involved and the rest of
<br>
world.  Such talk, even as talk, is incredibly corrosive and
<br>
damaging. 
<br>
<p>If you tried to take out all un- or anti- extropic forces you
<br>
would have very little of the world population left and many of
<br>
your own would be out to wipe you off the face of the planet. 
<br>
Don't go there.
<br>
<p>Besides, it is not Afghanistan that is the problem.  The
<br>
approximately 100,000 trained guerilla Islamic fundamentalists
<br>
are spread across at least 23 countries.  There is no way to get
<br>
them all within reason.  
<br>
<p>What you are proposing is far far more mad, pointless, inhumane
<br>
and utterly unproductive than any funametalist terrorist
<br>
rhetoric I've heard.

<em>&gt; I know that by raising this issue, I am going to take a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of flak.  But that is the purpose of the Extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list -- to engage in rational discussion of ideas -- even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if those ideas may seem repulsive at first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those of us who believe in the extropian/transhumanist perspectives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect that the world is likely to undergo a significant adjustment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of its perspective over the next 10-30 years.  These will include
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such developments as artificial intelligence, molecular nanotechnology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the elimination of aging and death and the feasibility of uploading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our minds into much more robust hardware.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We also know, from calculations that I and Eliezer (independently)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have done, that the annual cost between where we are now and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full manifestation of what we expect is feasible is of the order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 50 million lives per year.  That is approximately 10,000 times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the number of lives lost in the WTC attacks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to the CIA world fact book, the population of Afganistan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is ~25 million people.  In contrast the population of the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is 280+ million people and the world is 6+ billion.  It is highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlikely that the population of Afganistan will make a significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribution to the development of the advanced technological era
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we expect.  In fact their ongoing existence seems likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directed towards negatively impacting that development.  To the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent that the activities of individuals in Afganistan, or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support of such individuals by the leaders or population at large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delay the development of the era we anticipate, we can assign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a cost to it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From my perspective the analysis is relatively simple.  If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population of Afganistan, or the people supported by them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delay the onset of an era of advanced technological capabilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by 6 months or more, the value of their lives is negative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From a rational position, *if* the case can be made that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afgani position &amp; politics is likely to result in the diversion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of resources and delay the development of the technologies we anticipate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developing by more than 6 months, then a plan of genocide to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bury the country in rubble seems justified.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is this feasible?  It would appear to be the case.  100 Minutemann III
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ICBMs could launch 300+ Ktons each at Afganistan.  This roughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; translates to over 1 ton TNT/person.  While this is unlikely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kill everyone, it is likely to knock the population back to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sub-cave-person level and make a large negative impact on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feasibility of staging terrorist activities from that country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course the downside will be in the likelyhood that it may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in promoting individuals and countries in developing similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capabilities.  But of course once the line has been crossed, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are relatively few barriers towards the use of nuclear weapons to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue knocking down potential terrorists as needs require.
