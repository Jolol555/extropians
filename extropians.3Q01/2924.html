<em>&gt; I don't know if they were plonking me for that, just for my own comment

</em><br>
<p>Yes, I think that I was wrong about that.  It didn't and
<br>
wouldn't occur to me that someone would get plonked for a
<br>
one-liner; I just assumed (silly of me) that they were
<br>
referring to the extraordinarily provocative post by
<br>
J.R. Molloy that started this most sensitive of
<br>
discussions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I found it interesting that they were so assiduous in excising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rest of my message, and eliminating all context under which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was replying.  Typical liberal tactic.
</em><br>
<p>You are speaking carefully here?  You contend that people
<br>
from one side of the political spectrum are more likely
<br>
to do this?  (Seriously asking, here.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyone who read the rest of my message, or ANY of my other messages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this topic, could plainly see that I am most assuredly NOT racist.
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily!  It all depends on what is meant by &quot;racist&quot;.
<br>
To many, it is racist just to not be appalled by Fred Reed's
<br>
essay.  It's even possible that I'll come to agree with that
<br>
meaning, at least to some degree; but as yet, I harbor a deep
<br>
sympathy for anyone speaking &quot;unspeakable&quot; truths, or even
<br>
implying them.
