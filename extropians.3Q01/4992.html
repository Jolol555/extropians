<p>I recall <a href="http://www.hfac.uh.edu/gl/us3.htm">http://www.hfac.uh.edu/gl/us3.htm</a> from an earlier thread.
<br>
<p>(I skimmed that entire thread, hundreds of posts I believe, in one
<br>
sleepless night a few weeks ago.  Jeez.  And I'm still behind by
<br>
thousands of posts.)
<br>
<p>It says 297,000 slaves were imported into the &quot;Old World&quot; (the
<br>
chart primarily concerns the Americas from 1500-1870).  A bit of
<br>
searching on google also turned up
<br>
<a href="http://mogul.ahs.aspen.k12.co.us/gburson/WC/renaissance.htm">http://mogul.ahs.aspen.k12.co.us/gburson/WC/renaissance.htm</a>, which
<br>
says &quot;Portugese shipped about 140,000 black slaves into Europe from
<br>
Africa between 1444 and 1505.&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.kwabs.com/body_african_roots.html">http://www.kwabs.com/body_african_roots.html</a> has some of the story
<br>
of the introduction of African slaves to Portugal.
<br>
<a href="http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/30/144.html">http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/30/144.html</a> claims that as of
<br>
1780 there were 20,000 African slaves in Switzerland of all places.
<br>
<p>So when were those ~300,000 or more African slaves in Europe
<br>
emancipated?  <a href="http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~albion/threads/misc-slavery.html">http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~albion/threads/misc-slavery.html</a>
<br>
indicates perhaps 1772 in England and 1778 in Scotland.  Portugal
<br>
_may_ have been the only western European nation to abolish slavery
<br>
after the US -- 1869 according to
<br>
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/9generic3.shtml">http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/9generic3.shtml</a>
<br>
I wasn't able to find much information on emancipation within
<br>
Europe, most of what's available concerns European nations abolishing
<br>
the slave trade and freeing colonial slaves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Slavery was in fact the peculiar institution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the United States, at least among Enlightenment societies;
</em><br>
<p>Were Italian, Portugese, Dutch, English, Spanish, French, Danish
<br>
and Swedish (probably among others) slave traders _not_ members of
<br>
Enlightenment societies?  Three things do seem different about US
<br>
slavery:  scale (and then only if you consider the French, Spanish,
<br>
Portugese colony-derived nations not children of the Enlightenment),
<br>
it went out with a bang rather than a whimper, and the blatant
<br>
disconnect between the first nation supposedly founded on equal
<br>
rights for all (men) that also condoned holding millions in the
<br>
most unequal position imaginable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Christianity had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put a severe dent in slavery in Europe a long time before, with serfdom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; filling some of the void.
</em><br>
<p><a href="http://www2.prestel.co.uk/littleton/jmslaver.htm">http://www2.prestel.co.uk/littleton/jmslaver.htm</a> (admittedly part
<br>
of an anti-Catholic site) argues against the notion that Christianity
<br>
was responsible for the decline of slavery in Europe.  My summary:
<br>
economic and military conditions such as the decline of Rome and
<br>
the Turks closing off slave markets to Italian traders caused the
<br>
decline of slavery in Europe; Christian officials were silent on
<br>
the matter or apologists for slavery until well after its decline;
<br>
the African slave trade was operated by and praised by Christians;
<br>
deists and rationalists initiated anti-slavery sentiments in western
<br>
Europe and America.
