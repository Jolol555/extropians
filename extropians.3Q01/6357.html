</em><br>
<p>That is a little unfair. They have been serious about peace for a very long 
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>Try cramming a heap of US citizens into a tiny and deprived space with 
<br>
appalling restrictions upon their normal movement, with most of what you 
<br>
would consider essential rights taken away by faceless, brutal soldiers and 
<br>
see if those US citizens would be peaceful. *Of course* some of the 
<br>
Palestinians have gone for the violent solution, what else could be 
<br>
expected? Many normally enlightened members of this list have been braying 
<br>
for incredible and truly terrifying violent solutions lately.
<br>
<p>The Palestinians are just people. They are the same as the people on the 
<br>
other side of the border. When you forget that they are people then you can 
<br>
justify atrocities... exactly the same way those fools who rode the 
<br>
airplanes into the WTC did.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The image of them cheering is hard to get rid of.
</em><br>
<p>Which is probably why the clip was played over and over again... or maybe I 
<br>
am wording that wrongly. I should probably say that the viewers were played 
<br>
by those that screened the tape of those kids. It was guaranteed to get a 
<br>
nasty reaction. It almost certainly was not representative. So, why do you 
<br>
think they showed it?

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
