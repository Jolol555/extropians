<em>&gt; Hey Eli-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Had you heard of this project before?  How does their approach compare with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your seed AI theory?  What do you think of their chances for passing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turing test in 10 years?
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, they don't expose the theory they're using online.  People
<br>
always have capabilities and knowledge that aren't immediately apparent,
<br>
and geniuses may manage to build something real even under the umbrella of
<br>
an unworkable theory.  Because they've decided to clam up about what
<br>
they're actually doing, I can't give as detailed an analysis as I'd like. 
<br>
Basically I have to interpolate from what I know about the ways that
<br>
people tend to think about AI, the accomplishments they've chosen to boast
<br>
about, and the few fragments of technical description that are available. 
<br>
That said, their AI theory most certainly appears to suck, and I would put
<br>
their chance of passing the Turing test in ten years at zero, unless the
<br>
organization shifts to a completely new theory.  My guess is that the
<br>
incoherent babblings they've achieved are every bit as dumb as they
<br>
appear, and not simple cases of something that could scale up to greater
<br>
complexity.
