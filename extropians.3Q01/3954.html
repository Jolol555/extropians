<em>&gt; &gt;Have you experienced discrimination?  Did you have to

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well I almost hate to say it because I know some will make idealogical hay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of it but, no.  I mean growing up as a black kid in a mostly white school I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endured my share of hostilities.  But when it came to occupational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity I really had my pick of the litter.
</em><br>
<p>Good point Zero, I'll note that peer hostility in school, IMHO is going
<br>
to be bad for anyone that is different. Having black skin is simply an
<br>
easy handle for bullies to latch onto. For me it was being 'four-eyes'
<br>
(and a genius to boot). When I moved to NH at age 9, I stepped on my
<br>
glasses and 'lost' them one day, and fortunately my parents
<br>
procrastinate enough that I never replaced them. I had 20/30 vision
<br>
anyways, so it wasn't anywhere near as much of a help as thick nerd
<br>
frames were a hindrance.
<br>
<p>Also having the name 'Michael' was another handle for cruel kids to
<br>
latch onto (the old motorcycle rhyme)....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you really want to kindle racial hatred, then just let the goverment hand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out windfalls to already wealthy blacks while there are still white folks on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welfare!  Let the race wars begin!
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. How much do you want to bet that if they are enacted that they
<br>
do just that?
