</em><br>
<p>And what do you base this on? Sure, we all agree that the basic
<br>
transhumanist vision requires wealthy, open societies that tolerate even
<br>
wild experimentation. But your pessimistic description of the rest of
<br>
the world sounds very much like you have just taken the common
<br>
pessimistic assumptions about &quot;this is how the world is&quot; and run with
<br>
it.  Around *three billion* people live in nations that are for all
<br>
practical purposes making the transition from third world nations to
<br>
first world nations. Sure, not evenly and definitely far too slowly. But
<br>
the impact of that, together with accelerating spread of technology and
<br>
globalisation, will definitely make the world in just 10-20 years
<br>
extremely different. Unless you belive in a hard takeoff singularity
<br>
soon, much will happen over the years. To just give up on some region
<br>
and say &quot;they are too backwards to matter&quot; is a stupid idea - Japan was
<br>
once in that category too. Not to mention the US. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actively exterminating terrorists is essential if First World transhumans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever to make it to the 22nd century.  The Pentagon's Strategic Defense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Initiative (SDI) or &quot;Star Wars&quot; program is really intended to fend off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear blackmail from the Third World.  Such nuclear blackmail would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take the form of &quot;give us  your money, food, medicine, etc. for free or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we will nuke New York City&quot;  SDI would simply counter their missiles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and kill them.  The Third World must &quot;die&quot;  by upgrading to First World
</em><br>
<em>&gt; status by going for capitalism and foreign investment like India appears to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be doing or die by the intertribal/civil war combined with the infection and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starvation that comes with unrestricted overpopulation. - William.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I think this list could come up with around a hundred ways of
<br>
wiping out NYC in ways that SDI could never fix within a week (some have
<br>
already been posted). Terrorism is going to be a serious problem. But
<br>
I'm not sure it is going to be *the* problem in going from human to
<br>
transhuman.
<br>
<p>While I agree with your idea that it is in our best interest to help the
<br>
third world become first, I think you phrase things in a worrying way.
<br>
If you express it as if it has to &quot;die&quot; in order to guarantee our
<br>
safety, especially when you also mix in talk about actively
<br>
exterminating terrorists, it starts to sound far too much like Robert's
<br>
proactive genocide post. It might not be the intention, but it is a
<br>
rather slippery memetic attractor when you start thinking that a certain
<br>
group of people are 1) dangerous, 2) useless and 3) going to grow into a
<br>
huge problem and 4) when you are using mental concepts related to
<br>
killing.  
<br>
<p>So, let's turn around the thinking: how can we help the third world get
<br>
first world in the best possible way? And how can we circumvent the
<br>
forces that are against this? Among later you find not just
<br>
funadmentalists, but also plenty of intellectuals and activists decrying
<br>
globalisation, nationalists seeing threats to their powerbases and
<br>
companies that prefer bilateral treaties rather than multilateral
<br>
treaties since they can avoid competition that way. 
<br>
<p>Helping the third world to become the first world is enlightened
<br>
self-interest. It is not just the issue of us not wanting to get messy
<br>
stuff like terrorism, refugees, wars and epidemics in our back yards. It
<br>
is also about gaining valuable trading partners, billions of more minds
<br>
to solve the hard problems, speeding past the worrying environmental
<br>
impact bump you get during industrialisation and gaining access to the
<br>
cultural treasures of other cultures, other ways of thinking. Because
<br>
such a shift would change western culture too - the Japanese elements
<br>
leaking into it right now are just a trickle compared to what will
<br>
happen. Creolisation is a good thing. 
<br>
<p>But in order to get to this win-win situation we better stop thinking of
<br>
the third world as a hopeless basket case we, the enlightened white man,
<br>
has to save from itself. There is plenty of promising trends out there,
<br>
but you have to look for them and get to learn the real complexity of
<br>
the situation.
