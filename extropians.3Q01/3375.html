<p>
Is Extropianism mainly for American's? How many Europeans are on this
<br>
list and how much, if any, european philosophy is in your
<br>
Extropianism?
<br>
<p>How will the transhumanist movement deal with people's fears: the
<br>
pessimism/realism that experience engenders? Will technology really
<br>
change how people are or will people have to do that for themselves? 
<br>
<p>The degree of optimism on this list concerning the future is
<br>
definitely infectious and I'd really love it to be as e.g.. Mr.
<br>
Broderick envisions but People have milked the meme concerning the
<br>
power of science to improve the human condition to death.
<br>
<p>The egg heads (no offense intended) have been saying that technology
<br>
will solve this and that and remove this and that for centuries now.
<br>
Technology has indeed developed the cures for many diseases and
<br>
increased crop harvests etc. but most people don't get the benefit of
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>Will what most people get out of a time and technology that can
<br>
produce diamond houses cheaply be a diamond bullet in the head? If not
<br>
why?
<br>
<p>Will Transhumanism become a sort of super technocratic society in
<br>
which technologists develop technology only for themselves or can
<br>
others join? Will it be the third word that matches: aristocracy,
<br>
racism.......... transhumanism?
<br>
<p>After all this biotech superman thing is basically a child of National
<br>
Socialism. Sure, now one can in theory claim that with gene
<br>
manipulation even defectives CAN be healed. WILL they be healed?
<br>
<p>Are the words can and should synonyms?
<br>
<p>Over the time (years) that I have been a member of this list I have,
<br>
from time to time, noticed what I (perhaps wrongly) interpret to be
<br>
disdain for poor/uneducated/less intelligent people in many postings
<br>
so I wonder  Will everybody get a better body or will there be a races
<br>
of super humans and slave race that serve them?
<br>
<p>What is to stop Transhumanism from becoming the scientific arm of
<br>
future dictatorships?
<br>
<p>Can Libertarianism be summed up like this: all the freedom, justice,
<br>
health and life that money can buy. If so how does that change things
<br>
from the way they are now?
<br>
<p>Is or will Transhumanism be nothing more than intellectual confusion,
<br>
moral imbecility, and willful ugliness elaborated into a
<br>
self-conscious ideology: the worship of wealth, power, novelty and
<br>
machinery? Will it become the ultimate expression of what many call a
<br>
culture less and materialist America: a sort of burger and coke
<br>
religion?
<br>
<p>Must Transhumanism demand spiritual pathology. Obviously not since Mr.
<br>
Broderick seems to allow for something else, as it were, but how many
<br>
transhumans can make allowances for that which they cannot see?
<br>
<p>For me the ends justify the means but it seems that in Transhumanism
<br>
the means is the end. Is this a fair judgment?
<br>
<p>There are those who say that Libertarians and individualists are most
<br>
likely to be solely concerned with their own egotistical and
<br>
Narcissistic gratification. Since there are a few here on the list I
<br>
ask would you refute this claim and how/why?
<br>
<p>How would a Transhumanist egalitarian/collectivist effort express
<br>
itself? Would they go for a Borg type society as in Star Trekk?
<br>
<p>Why not find ways of extending the use of our already existing brains
<br>
instead of making new ones? If the mind can work outside of the human
<br>
body why go for any form of containment at all? Is it possible to
<br>
exist without limits?
<br>
<p>Since our instincts and emotions are our driving forces if we insulate
<br>
ourselves from them or get rid of them what will our motivating force
<br>
be?
<br>
<p>Are people in general in greater danger of being mistreated by
<br>
transhumans/extropians than, white people are of being mistreated by
<br>
negroes?
<br>
<p>In attempting to become more than human will we become less?
<br>
<p>Don't get me wrong. I'm not against science and technology. I'd
<br>
install a bionic leg today if I could -_-  It's just that I have lived
<br>
a lot of my life in what you would call primitive circumstances and
<br>
have taken a long time to learn about all the different stuff you guys
<br>
talk about here.
<br>
<p>In reading up I have found questions which have bothered me but I did
<br>
not want to trouble you all with my lack of knowledge/understanding.
<br>
However since some people on this list seriously wanted to discuss
<br>
whether or not white people are nicer than black people I figured that
<br>
my questions won't be the most stupid ever brought up on the list.
<br>
<p>So, as the progress of technology fuels its own acceleration and
<br>
rushes us into the future at exponential speed will we vanish up our
<br>
own anuses?
<br>
<p>Mr. Bones
