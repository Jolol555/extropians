<p>For the sake of reason. Please GROW UP. No one expects terrorists operating 
<br>
from fundamentalist, irrational
<br>
assumptions about the world to keep their intellect in gear. Rather 
<br>
foolishly i did expect that to happen on this
<br>
list. Apparently i have been sadly mistaken.
<br>
<p>These constant calls for full blooded revenge, are getting tedious. In some 
<br>
cases are getting towards the level of
<br>
&quot;Bar room arguments&quot;.
<br>
In all fairness i have to say some of the list members who's views on the 
<br>
issue are closer to my own, have indulged
<br>
in some rather direct personal attacks over the past days.
<br>
It was my understanding that this list existed for presumably, balanced, 
<br>
intelligent, rational, humans to discuss various
<br>
ideas and concept pertaining to science, technology, and related social issues.
<br>
Some of the behavior on this list just shows that despite many ppl having a 
<br>
Promethean self image, many of us are
<br>
far from the peek of human development.
<br>
If ppl can't make some kind of intelligent salient point about the issue ( 
<br>
which for quite a few list members i
<br>
can easily  understand ) i for one would be more than happy if they would 
<br>
hold back until they have calmed
<br>
down enough to make rational statements.
<br>
<p>Surly one primary Extropian value is the concept of ones intellect being in 
<br>
primary control of ones conscious actions
<br>
at all times. If we allow ourselves to loose rational self-control we 
<br>
become little better than the fools who caused
<br>
Tuesdays destruction.
<br>
<p>Please express your thoughts and ideas, but don't just rant.
<br>
<p><p><p>&quot;FURIOUS GREEN DREAMS, LAY SLEEPING IN STATE,
<br>
BUT SOON THE GREAT JELLY SHALL RISE FROM THE
<br>
DEPTHS,
<br>
AND ALL THOSE WHO MOCKED SHALL KNOW THEIR FATE
<br>
IS SEALED&quot;

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hacienda,
