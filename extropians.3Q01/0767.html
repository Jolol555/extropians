Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought
<br>
by Pascal Boyer
<br>
<a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/subjects/science/nr_science.asp">http://www.barnesandnoble.com/subjects/science/nr_science.asp</a>
<br>
Unlike other books offering &quot;scientific&quot; explanations for religion, this one
<br>
actually details the common strands running through spiritual concepts and
<br>
feelings, rather than using science to simply explain away religion. Employing
<br>
the latest findings of evolutionary psychology and cognitive science, Boyer
<br>
shows why religious ideas make sense to humans and explains just which ideas
<br>
are acceptable.

Unlike other books offering &quot;scientific&quot; explanations for religion, this one
<br>
actually details the common strands running through spiritual concepts and
<br>
feelings, rather than using science to simply explain away religion. Drawing
<br>
upon the latest findings of evolutionary psychology and cognitive science,
<br>
Boyer shows why religious ideas make sense to humans and just which ideas are
<br>
acceptable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the Publisher
</em><br>
&quot;Many of us have endless questions about faith, spirituality, and the place of
<br>
religious thinking in the world. But one central question - perhaps the
<br>
central question - about religion has remained strangely inaccessible: Why do
<br>
we have it at all? Until recently, if you'd asked this of most
<br>
anthropologists, they'd have told you that the question was ill-formulated and
<br>
too vague to be of scientific interest.&quot; &quot;In fact, the intellectual tools for
<br>
thinking about the problem simply didn't exist. Now, says Pascal Boyer, they
<br>
do, provided by theories and research in evolutionary biology and cognitive
<br>
psychology.&quot;--BOOK JACKET.

...a penetrating scientific analysis of religion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Library Journal
</em><br>
Utilizing cross-cultural studies and a multidisciplinary approach,
<br>
anthropologist Boyer (Luce Professor of Collective Memory and Individual
<br>
Memory, Washington Univ.) argues that the origin, development, and diversity
<br>
of religion are scientifically explainable within the naturalistic frameworks
<br>
of evolutionary biology and cognitive psychology. His point of departure is
<br>
the complex human brain and its mental activity, both being a result of
<br>
natural selection enhancing the adaptation, survival, and reproductive success
<br>
of our social ancestors through over four million years of hominid evolution.
<br>
Boyer focuses on the inference systems and intuitive expectations of evolved
<br>
human brain capacities to account for the biocultural origin of religious
<br>
concepts and supernatural agents (e.g., gods, ghosts, demons, spirits, and
<br>
witches). He is to be commended for his scholarly and critical examination of
<br>
religion. Some readers may find his arguments difficult to follow and to
<br>
accept, but this is nevertheless a significant contribution to anthropology.

<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Kirkus
</em><br>
A roundabout consideration of why humans turn to otherworldly thoughts. Boyer
<br>
(Collective Memory and Individual Memory/Washington Univ.) is fluent in
<br>
several disciplines that touch on the cognitive sciences, including physical
<br>
anthropology and evolutionary psychology. All of these disciplines, along with
<br>
classical philosophy, come to bear on his account of why humans in every place
<br>
and at every time have found it necessary or desirable to think of gods, the
<br>
afterlife, and other extraordinary matters, building &quot;complex supernatural
<br>
constructs out of very simple conceptual bricks&quot; (such as the recognition that
<br>
all mortal beings die). While recognizing that religious beliefs vary widely
<br>
within and between cultures and individuals, the author suggests that we hold
<br>
them largely because we can; that is, all humans possess &quot;the mind it takes to
<br>
have religion,&quot; a mind that uses processes such as &quot;decoupling&quot; and &quot;inference
<br>
systems&quot; to arrive at what Boyer considers to be eminently practical reasoning
<br>
about the meaning of life (reasoning that can sometimes involve inventing
<br>
cosmic explanations for the mysteries and problems the mind confronts).
<br>
Regrettably, the author is rarely straightforward in making such arguments,
<br>
preferring instead to linger over (and then demolish) straw-man arguments and
<br>
to show the flaws in other influential theories of religion (such as those of
<br>
William James). The noted biologist E.O. Wilson gives a more concise and
<br>
better argued account of the evolutionary basis of religion-if one that seems
<br>
calculated to offend believers, as Boyer's is not-in Consilience (1998). For
<br>
all that, Boyer's account has many merits, showing how the mind works by means
<br>
of analogy, trial anderror, and sheer speculation (the more counterintuitive
<br>
the better) in the service of helping us to become comfortable inside our own
<br>
skins and sleep well at night. Students of psychology and philosophy will find
<br>
much value in Boyer's treatise, but it will probably strike most general
<br>
readers as dry and daunting.
