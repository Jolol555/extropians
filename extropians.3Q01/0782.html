<em>&gt; &gt; For me, this whole business is all cold and calculating risk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis. Any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and all risk associated with my ceasing to exist is unacceptable risk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Unknowns are risk. Therefore the only logical conclusion is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do all I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to reduce that risk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pedantry:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All risk is undesirable, but not all risk is unacceptable.  Some risks are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary - for example, risks that can act as tools to reduce other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risks.  If you regard all risk as unacceptable, without being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose between large risks and small risks, you wind up in a fantasy world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where you don't have to take any risks.  Shortly thereafter, you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crushed by a still-hostile universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm pretty sure you meant to say &quot;undesirable&quot; instead of &quot;unacceptable&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially since you went on to correctly use the term &quot;reduce&quot; rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than &quot;eliminate&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Pedantry accepted, more or less. Actually, I did mean &quot;unacceptable&quot; -- but
<br>
just didn't go on to clarify the obvious point of focussing on reducing the
<br>
risk as close to zero as possible in a as logic manner as possible given the
<br>
resources to hand. I'm quite fanatical about the not ceasing to exist thing,
<br>
but recognize the limitations...so getting rid of aging first, and upgrade
<br>
the hardware by degrees later such as to reduce that risk with every
<br>
upgrade.
<br>
<p>In theory, I'll eventually find out what my level of acceptable risk is, but
<br>
I imagine I'll be -- at the very least -- a large dispersed collection of
<br>
self-powered computing devices in the outer solar system by that time.
<br>
Although that's probably going to be vunerable to close supernova.
<br>
<p>But anyway, I digress. None of that is going to come about if a cure for
<br>
aging doesn't happen relatively soon, and sitting down and waiting isn't
<br>
going to make that happen any sooner.
