<p>
Well I'm probably as misinformed as the rest of the you, but I just thought
<br>
I'd have my 10 pennyworth of comment/solution giving as this has been a
<br>
subject close to my heart for many years. I'm not a great writer a la
<br>
Charlie or Anders but I feel I ought to give this one a go. I live in a 1/2
<br>
million population city in the west of England that has a large Muslim
<br>
population, supporting about 8 mosques at last count. I meet and talk to
<br>
Muslims on a daily basis both socially and at work, I shop in Muslim-owned
<br>
shops and my children go to schools that celebrate Eid and Diwahli as well
<br>
as Easter and Christmas, my sons' best friend at school is the son of
<br>
Iranian immigrants, i had planned to go to Teheran in November to watch
<br>
Ireland V Iran in a world cup qualifier, not so sure now. I know Algerians,
<br>
Egyptians, Somalians, Iraqis, Turks, Afghani and Pakistani people and
<br>
although they are all devastated by events in the US and deeply ashamed that
<br>
they might be tarred by the same brush, none of them are very surprised that
<br>
this has happened, and frankly neither am I.
<br>
<p>However most Americans do seem surprised that this has happened, why are
<br>
they so uniformed? In the UK we have lived with the expectation of terrorism
<br>
since I was a young child, my parents were Irish immigrants to this country
<br>
so they understood the nature of being treated as the &quot;enemy within&quot;, much
<br>
as immigrants from Muslim countries to the west have felt for most of the
<br>
last week. On top of this fear of being identified with the perpetrators is
<br>
the threat of being blown up by along with any intended targets of
<br>
terrorism - however understanding what drove the IRA bombers and a modicum
<br>
of identification with my cultural heritage - has always given me some
<br>
satisfaction that the perpetrators (whether knowing or unknowing) of all the
<br>
wrongs against my &quot;people&quot; are not getting away with it completely. So for
<br>
instance I get a frisson of satisfaction when the IRA bomb the Grand Hotel
<br>
in Brighton where Margaret Thatcher was staying (1984) or launch mortar
<br>
bombs into the garden of No.10 Downing Street (early 90's), but am sickened
<br>
by the savagery of many other IRA atrocities and just wish they'd stop,
<br>
which of course they have, almost. Many in the Muslim world would find these
<br>
emotions familiar. It's a familiar fact that most states in the Muslim
<br>
world, and indeed no Arab states, are not democracies, or have not been
<br>
except for brief experiments in Algeria and Egypt. This of course means that
<br>
no Arab peoples have chosen their own governments, they are either
<br>
Monarchies or Military Dictatorships. However the idea of pan-Arabism the
<br>
idea of one Arab nation is highly popular among the ordinary non-voting
<br>
populations of North Africa through to the Gulf states. From the second
<br>
world war through to the 70s this was a Socialist Pan-Arabism ruthlessly
<br>
suppressed by Governments across the region. Some nations where this idea
<br>
gained some popularity, Yemen and Egypt and Libya were similarly ruthlessly
<br>
undermined or attacked by the US or European powers (Suez). Pan-Arabism did
<br>
not disappear though and was allowed to manifests itself in a fundamentalist
<br>
Islamic form in much the same way as Marxism was discouraged in the IRA and
<br>
romantic old Ireland republicanism was encouraged by the American
<br>
government. So most Arabs see the Arab world as one nation - they  see their
<br>
governments as pawns of the West, or at best as too frightened to antagonise
<br>
the West and they see the American Army in Saudi Arabia as an army of
<br>
occupation in the most holy and important part of the Arab world. it would
<br>
be as if the Soviet army had occupied Washington DC in the 80s and then
<br>
asked what all you Texans, Californians and Vermonters were so pissed off
<br>
about, it had nothing to do with you. Apart from the unelected Saudi Royal
<br>
family and their allied unelected governments, everyone in the Arab world
<br>
wants the US out of Saudi Arabia. In much the same away as most Irish people
<br>
would want to see the Brits out of Ulster, but don't necessarily support the
<br>
bombers. In non- democratic countries though, any dissent is treason, at
<br>
least in Ireland we can now how a reasonable discussion about it. The people
<br>
of the Arab world believe that it is actually the US that is preventing this
<br>
reasonable discussion. That is why they are not surprised that some of their
<br>
number have done this dreadful act.
<br>
<p>If this was the USAs only mistake in the region it would be enough but there
<br>
is much much more.
<br>
<p>No one likes Saddam Hussein. Saddam was/is a Ba'athist, and in fact was one
<br>
of those Ba'ath leaders who hoped to be the one leader that bought about the
<br>
pan-Arab socialist utopia popular in the 70's, along with the Syrian and
<br>
Egyptian leaderships Everyone in the West and East was relieved when his
<br>
territorial ambitions were thwarted during the Gulf War, but most people in
<br>
the Arab world know that Saddam and his power was really a creation of the
<br>
CIA, bolstered to fight a war by proxy against Iran during the 70's where
<br>
millions died in battles reminiscent of WWI. Iranians still chant &quot;Death to
<br>
America&quot; at Friday prayers for half an hour every week with some
<br>
justification. The Shah was imposed in an American backed military coup on
<br>
Iran in 1956, many Iranian immigrants to this country were escaping the
<br>
Shahs torture chambers, interrogators trained by the CIA to instil fear into
<br>
left leaning intellectuals who refused to leave the country. Islamic
<br>
fundamentalism was ignored until it was too late and they ended up with an
<br>
anti-American fundamentalist revolution instead of the mythical communist
<br>
revolution they were attempting to suppress. Muslims in feel that any
<br>
attempt to control their own destiny in their own lands is ruthlessly
<br>
suppressed by American foreign policy. Iran has improved remarkably since
<br>
those days, women stand in Parliament, have access to higher education,
<br>
opposition is tolerated, open elections are held, granted the mullahs have
<br>
the last word on who is allowed power, but immense distrust for America
<br>
remains. The millions of dead from the Iran/Iraq war are the testament of
<br>
the USAs terrorism waged upon a people who just wanted to govern themselves.
<br>
I know most Americans are unaware it even happened, but the football match
<br>
between Iran and the USA at the last world cup was outside the USA  was
<br>
probably one of the most watched sporting events in the history of the
<br>
world. Not many sporting events are preceded by overtly political speeches
<br>
from Bill Clinton and the Ayatollah Khameni calling for calm and tolerance.
<br>
<p>Solutions -
<br>
<p>Well there are no solutions, it would be nice to turn the clock back to wwII
<br>
and do things differently, and as someone who has grown up and learnt my
<br>
politics in a libertarian-communist tradition but is aware that it's
<br>
unlikely my preferred political/economic utopia will ever be implemented,
<br>
I'd just like to say what I would do if I was President of the World for a
<br>
day.
<br>
<p>USA armed forces based in Saudi Arabia occupy Iraq, overthrow Saddam,
<br>
oversee Democratic elections and then go directly to the Congo to enforce
<br>
peace where over 2 million have died in wars over diamonds and other primary
<br>
resources in the last 5 years since the USA backed Mobutu was ousted, and do
<br>
the same again.
<br>
<p>Chinese forces (the only avowedly atheist nation on earth) under the
<br>
auspices of the United Nations occupy Israel/Palestine with 100.000+ troops
<br>
and enforce Peace plus all the UN resolutions that have been completely
<br>
ignored by Israel. China has no axe to grind, and will at last be given the
<br>
responsibility commensurate with it's size and population and power of
<br>
taking it's place outside it's borders on the world stage - might make it's
<br>
government fucking grow up too.
<br>
<p>A UN force made up of everybody occupy Afghanistan and establish a
<br>
government dedicated to human rights.
<br>
<p>A world wide Marshall plan (one of the few decent American foreign
<br>
policies), eradicate third world debt and allow the free movement of people
<br>
globally.
<br>
<p>I could have written a lot more .About dealing with bonded child serfs in
<br>
Pakistan, about 500.000 cancer deaths among the Marsh Arabs due to depleted
<br>
Uranium shells, about the West turning a blind eye to Russia killing a
<br>
250.000 Chechens in Grozny, all of this in the last 10 years, but as I said
<br>
this is the longest post I've ever written to the Extropians list anyway,
<br>
and I'd rather talk face to face with people. As Transhumanists I would hope
<br>
this does not derail our project.
<br>
<p>that's enough.
