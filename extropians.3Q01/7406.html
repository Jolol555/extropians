<em>&gt; &gt; Debatable, JR. Many of the bin Laden types are Saudi citizens or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ex-citizens. Them being pissed at our support of the Saud family could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rationally be looked at in the same light as the degree to which many of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; us looked at the Communist Chinese government support of the Clinton
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Administration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I guress there's quite a difference in the degree of extremism involved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Didn't hear about any Americans going ape and committing atrocities in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beijing.
</em><br>
<p>That's right, fortunately because we have things like a free press (for
<br>
whoever owns a press) and the impeachment process to help people vent
<br>
out more than is likely under a more authoritarian regieme. If you are
<br>
prevented from openly parodying, satirizing, lampooning, and
<br>
investigating your leaders, those most opposed to them are more likely
<br>
to stew in their juices until they are motivated to commit greater
<br>
action (especially if they are stripped of citizenship and deported).
<br>
It's bad enough that McVeigh's act was essentially an anti-Clinton act
<br>
(though he had inherited an ATF gone out of control). We did see more
<br>
violent acts by individuals against the federal government during his
<br>
administration than in several decades.
<br>
<p>Why no acts against Beijing? Easy: they live in a totalitarian society.
<br>
Outside of, say, bombing one of their embassies elsewhere, there is
<br>
little that people can do to them, unless you attack Chinese owned
<br>
assets here in the US.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm sure that there are many Saudi citizens that wish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they had a process like impeachment. Only a few are evidently willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resort to violence instead. What bothers me is that they attack us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather than the Saudi family itself. Why do we not see more anti-Saud
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrorism in Arabia itself? Perhaps it is because violence against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; infidels is far more acceptable than against other believers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It doesn't seem likely to me that Saudi citizens were involved in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious fanatic terrorism of September 11, 2001. Do you think British eyes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see it like that?
</em><br>
<p>According to the FBI there were in fact a number of Saudi citizens
<br>
involved in the 9-11 events, though there is some question as to whether
<br>
those were the real ids of the perps or not.
