</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet Switzerland, as a major banking center of the world, is at least as

</em><br>
<p>It's a bit different, don't you think?  First, having troops in an area or
<br>
government aid is different than having some sort of financial connection.
<br>
Second, the people who usually worry about big banks and the like are First
<br>
Worlders.  (Third Worlders weren't rioting in Seattle and Genoa.)  Third,
<br>
most financial transactions that Swiss banks are involved in are individual
<br>
or corporate -- not public sector.  Most of that, too, takes place in the
<br>
First World -- not the Third World.  But even beyond that, what little does
<br>
take place in the Third World is usually private anyway.  Helping to fund
<br>
some business or other is not the same as having troops on your soil or as
<br>
supporting an oppressive government.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The countries that are targeted for terrorism are those who have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most active in combatting it and spreading ideas of liberty, freedom,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and individual rights, which are anathema to the sort of control freaks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with anti-liberty mindsets.
</em><br>
<p>Not exactly so.  The US government plays both sides of the fence here
<br>
anyhow, but often it has been on the side not of spreading freedom and
<br>
individual rights, but of supporting some idea of stability, playing world
<br>
social engineer, or just playing to internal politics in Washington.  This
<br>
explains, e.g., support of the Shah of Iran (which arguably made Iranian
<br>
society ripe for revolution instead of ripe for freedom), Qaddafy in Libya
<br>
(who became an enemy of America in the 1980s), Marcos in the Phillipines
<br>
(who was no friend of freedom and individual rights), Turkey (which has been
<br>
busy for over a decade now butchering its Kurd minority), Guetamala
<br>
(supporting the death squads there), Osama bin Laden (in the 1980s when he
<br>
was our friend because he was the Soviet's enemy) and so on.
<br>
<p>This is not to say there haven't been exceptions to this pattern of
<br>
supporting terror, but the pattern is very clear.
<br>
<p>I fear is that most people in the world who face American backed oppression
<br>
will go on to hate America completely -- not separating the good things
<br>
about our society (the connected elements of freedom, individualism, reason,
<br>
dynamism) from the bad (a big bloated welfare-warfare state) -- and some
<br>
will do their best to attack it or support attackers of it.  It's kind of
<br>
like the British Empire.  Britain probably was one of the least oppressive
<br>
big military empires, but what little oppression it did make people in its
<br>
colonies think capitalism and free trade were part and parcel with
<br>
imperialism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyone who thinks the Taliban are to be considered agents of freedom are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously deranged.
</em><br>
<p>Does anyone here think they are?  Has anyone made that claim?  However, the
<br>
US governement helped to put the Taleban in power by its policies in
<br>
Afghanistan during the 1980s.  Now, we are reaping what Carter, Reagan, and
<br>
Bush sowed.  Unfortunately, their blunders are not visited on them, but on
<br>
innocents such as those in the WTC and Pentagon and on board those jet
<br>
liners used as missles.
<br>
<p>Later!
