Wow, Russell!
<br>
That was really amazing.
<br>
<p>I never went through anything remotely religious. It genuinely gives me the 
<br>
chills to think of religion taking someone the way it did you. And yet why 
<br>
should it? I have friends who are well meaning christians that I would 
<br>
trust with my life... however the idea of those memes taking root inside my 
<br>
mind like some nasty alien growth... [shudder]
<br>
<p>I think this may be one of the reasons why so many atheists breathe such 
<br>
fire at religion (myself among them).
<br>
<p>Hmmm...
<br>
<p>Thanks for posting that Russell. The insight gained from one who has 
<br>
&quot;crossed over&quot; from the other side strikes me as very valuable.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Miriam

<p><em>&gt;I grew up in a middle-of-the-road, respectable working class household 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with mild Christian beliefs, but decided at a very early age - i.e. early 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;primary school - that Christianity had about the same truth content as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Greek or Norse mythology and would become moribund in exactly the same way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over time. Hey, I *love* Greek and Norse mythology, but no one believes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that stuff, not literally, not even the occasional neo-pagan that you run into.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I did, however, have a &quot;born again&quot; experience when I was about 12 or 13 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and went on to spend the next seven or so years - basically my adolescence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- struggling with my faith. In that time, I largely hung out in Christian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;semi-fundamentalist settings, including a goodly stint involved in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Pentacostalism. Most of my friends were also baby Christians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The real killer of my faith was that I could not solve the problem of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evil, despite my best endeavours - which I naturally expected to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;superior to those of any previous philosophical or theological thinkers &lt;g&gt;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Together with a whole lot of other convergent factors, this led to my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;finally chucking it all in, intellectually and emotionally, when I was at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;university, just before my 20th birthday, and towards the end of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one-year stint as Deputy President of the Evangelical Union on my campus. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It kinda cruelled any ambitions I had for the EU Presidency &lt;g&gt;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I've never lapsed back into any kind of religious faith. I actually find 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it liberating that there's no God or gods or externally imposed meanings 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and values out there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Two points:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(a) despite some of the comments made on the list, I, as a religious 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believer *was* prepared to test my beliefs against rational criteria. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;did not abandon those beliefs lightly but I did eventually abandon them, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and essentially for philosophical reasons, however heart-rending I found 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the process of tearing myself away from born-again Christianity;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(b) the people who were my friends or mentors during my adolescence were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not bad or obviously deluded. Some of my friends have likewise gone over 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the side of reason. Those who remain close friends of mine fit into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this category. But the ones who retain a Christian faith still have my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;respect and affection. Some of them may be intellectual opponents, and not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just over the issue of theism, but there are some good, intelligent and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sincere people there. I don't expect everyone to share my relentless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;commitment to rational inquiry, much as I wish they would and believe that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more of them would end up as transhumanists of some kind if they did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My only real enemies are those who argue (whether from a religious view or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;otherwise) for laws contraining the life of freedom and reason. Even then, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I can handle a fair bit of opposition from kind-hearted, if misguided, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people before I consider them enemies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ascend!

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
