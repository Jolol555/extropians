<em>&gt; &gt; The simple fact is that a welfare mother is not likely to be able to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;afford
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to pay *anything* to educate her children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think deadbeats who bring children into the world without the means to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adequately support them should be punished for this unconscionable abuse 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;negligence, and the children should be placed with more responsible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parents.
</em><br>
<p>A few questions:
<br>
<p>What of the inalienable right to procreate?  Should that be limited only to 
<br>
the fiscally fit?  Should that right be denied to the poor?  If so, why 
<br>
don't we just sterilize everyone living in poverty until they can prove that 
<br>
they are financially responsible enough to have the procedure reversed?  
<br>
Sound a little Orwellian?
<br>
<p>Do you think children would be better off in foster care than with their own 
<br>
loving parents, simply because the parents are poor?  Have you ever known 
<br>
anyone raised in the foster care system?
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
