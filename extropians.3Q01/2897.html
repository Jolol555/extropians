<em>&gt; I'm still waiting on someone to say what the racists statements,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tones, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attitudes have been said here. I haven't heard anyone make any racists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements. I haven't heard anyone say that any particular race was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherently superior. I've heard bigoted ones, and I've heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discriminatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know this may seem like nitpicking definitions, but its important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that words keep their meanings else more confusion erupts. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use the word racist, please have the common courtesy to know what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it means,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how it differs from bigoted and discriminatory.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, please.  This claim is so pathetic.  I can't believe that anybody really
<br>
needs to respond to such a demand for evidence.  But for the sake of
<br>
completeness, here I go.
<br>
<p>The article clearly claims that there are inherent differences between &quot;all&quot;
<br>
blacks and &quot;all&quot; whites.  It does not even qualify these differences as
<br>
statistically likely or commonly found.  It clearly paints all whites with
<br>
one description while painting all blacks with a difference description.
<br>
The description of the whites is always superior than the description of the
<br>
blacks.  Not only does it argue that whites are better, but it claims that
<br>
blacks are incapable of duplicating the achievements of whites.  I don't
<br>
know how the article could be even more racist if it tried.
<br>
<p>Examples:  The article clearly blames welfare, crime, large police
<br>
departments, violence and fear on blacks only.  It claims that countries
<br>
without blacks do not have these problems.  It clearly states that the
<br>
author could determine the race of the bad teacher by the bad skills,
<br>
obviously because only blacks would show such poor skills while whites would
<br>
not.  The article clearly attributes an unsolved murder and unsolved thefts
<br>
to blacks under the assumptions that whites wouldn't commit those crimes.
<br>
The article clearly attributes civilization, science and the wheel to
<br>
whites.  It claims that technology, such as Microsoft products, are produced
<br>
by whites.  The author does not even seem to imagine that any blacks could
<br>
have ever contributed to any technology company such as Microsoft.
<br>
Furthermore, the author claims that blacks are incapable of duplicating the
<br>
achievements of whites.  He expresses the desire that blacks were capable of
<br>
studying or achieving academic degrees by their own merit, as if blacks were
<br>
incapable of higher learning, and implying that all academic degrees earned
<br>
by blacks were faked.  The author claims that only whites can achieve higher
<br>
levels of academic or civilized achievement, while blacks are incapable of
<br>
achieving the same level.
<br>
<p>I am (in)famous on this list for playing devil's advocate, giving the
<br>
benefit of the doubt, and for assuming the honest intentions of posters.
<br>
But even I cannot imagine how anybody can seriously consider this to be a
<br>
real article and not a blatant hate-filled ad hominem attack.  I believe
<br>
that it violates many of the list rules and should not be on this list.
<br>
Only the fact that it was not aimed at specific list members has prevented
<br>
me from seeking a ban on this topic and the posters who distributed this
<br>
garbage.
