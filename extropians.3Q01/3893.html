<p>Actually, I don't think it does follow logically. It may possibly be an 
<br>
accidental (and maladaptive) result of the desire for a &quot;normal&quot; healthy 
<br>
mate, but I don't think it *has* to come from that, and I doubt that we 
<br>
could ever prove that it comes from one or another factor, so we can 
<br>
speculate but never really come to a conclusion on this.
<br>
<p>The danger of associating it with evolution is that many people think that 
<br>
evolution is an infallible mechanism for creating better and better 
<br>
organisms. But that isn't so. Evolution is a grand game of roulette. 
<br>
Sometimes good designs get wiped out by trivial accidents and bad designs 
<br>
flourish. On the whole evolution works, but only in a blind, stumbling way.
<br>
<p>Racism could be seen as an expression of a desire for normalcy so that we 
<br>
tend to choose breeding mates who are healthy and not stricken with any 
<br>
really dangerous mutations. Unfortunately this means that superficial, 
<br>
trivial but obvious changes to the person's appearance would be biased 
<br>
heavily against (like different colored skin) when in fact they can be of 
<br>
great advantage to our genetic stock (my fair-skinned genetic line could 
<br>
certainly do with a bit more protection against the sun). At the same time 
<br>
this tendency to select based upon appearance can overlook very nasty 
<br>
traits like aberrant blood clotting and actually concentrate such genetic 
<br>
weaknesses in the limited &quot;pure&quot; gene pool.
<br>
<p>But I kinda doubt that this selection mechanism is genetic though. I think 
<br>
it is more likely to be social. I, with my anglo genes, am most attracted 
<br>
to Indian and Asian features in women... so I don't think an evolutionary 
<br>
explanation is really compelling.

<p><p><em>&gt;Racism and wish for longevity form the sides of he same coin, one of them

<em>&gt;I believe one could say the problem lies with collectivism, of which

</em><br>
<p>Your point here eludes me completely, I'm sorry.
<br>
I don't understand the connection you are trying to find between racism and 
<br>
collectivism, or even the opposition between those two and individualism 
<br>
and longevity.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
