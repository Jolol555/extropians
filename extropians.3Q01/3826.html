</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Step 2 doesn't require step 1. Like we discussed before, Jesse may not

<em>&gt; &gt; still believe that blacks cause more crime because of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and still make decisions based on race because of this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is where your reference to &quot;genetics&quot; and my definition diverge.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to be saying that if behavior isn't genetic, it is not racism.  Under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your definition saying &quot;All blacks are lazy&quot; is racist if one thinks they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a genetic predisposition to be lazy.  But the same statement is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racist if one thinks they have a cultural predisposition to be lazy.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree.
</em><br>
<p>I don't. Saying blacks have a cultural predisposition to like jazz music
<br>
isn't any more racist than saying that Japanese people have a cultural
<br>
predisposition to like sushi. Neither are racist statements, nor do they
<br>
exclude the possibility that people not of those cultures could also
<br>
like jazz or sushi.
<br>
<p>I doubt anyone here would say my statements about jazz or sushi lovers
<br>
are racist. It is only when such cultural generalizations are made which
<br>
illustrate members of that culture in a negative light do people try to
<br>
apply the 'racist' label to them. If it doesn't work for positive
<br>
statements but does for negative statements, it's not racism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Step 3:  Racial Discrimination - taking actions against those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Taking actions &quot;against&quot; sounds a bit negative, when it could also be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; applied in a positive light. i.e. Giving a race special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; privileges over some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Norm&quot;. I would just say taking action on some race because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their race. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know, nitpicking again... but just trying to be clear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed.  Taking any actions to treat one race differently than another is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racial discrimination.
</em><br>
<p>But what about actions that indirectly causes people of one race to be
<br>
treated predominantly different than other races, for instance,
<br>
geographic based discrimination (like 'risky zip code' restrictions on
<br>
mail order deliveries to zip codes with high fraud rates)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This goes back to black cops and Jesse again. I think they are grouping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; blacks together into a group based on environmental causes (same living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conditions, culture, neighborhoods?), not genetic heritage, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; though the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2 are very similar. The reason to nitpick this though is because without a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; clear understanding of this, a white person can not in fact point to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same issues that Jesse and black cops point to without being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; labeled racist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps.  But I was recently reminded that we can't redefine a word just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because we don't want to apply it the way it was intended.  I think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is an implied assumption that racism is defined as &quot;bad&quot;.  (I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it bad, but not by definition.)  I think the tendency to show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistical support for prejudice and discrimination as a justification that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it isn't racism is misguided.  It is racism.  It is a belief in &quot;justified&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racism rather than &quot;unjustified&quot; racism, but the belief system, prejudiced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumptions and resulting discrimination are the same.  Otherwise we end up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using different labels depending which side we are on, much as pro-Life and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pro-Choice factions do.  Those who believe in justified prejudice and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discrimination will argue that it's not racist because it's true, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those that disbelieve will call it racism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (This is a similar definition problem with defining &quot;religion&quot; as a false
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief.  We then have religious people saying that their belief in God is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a religion because it's true.)
</em><br>
<p>Which is verifiable? That is all that matters. Recognising cultural
<br>
phenomena that place minorities in a positive or negative light isn't
<br>
racism. Saying that those cultural phenomena are strictly caused by
<br>
genetics is.
