<br>
<em>&gt; I have been told (but have not independently confirmed), that at one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point, one high-profile African-American said that there was no more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrible feeling for him than to be walking down the street at night, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hearing footsteps, and being _relieved_ when he saw that the other person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was white.
</em><br>
<p>Such things have routinely been commented on by black columnists in the
<br>
Washington Post. Here's my theory:
<br>
<p>For this purpose we can divide blacks into two groups, 'raceless' and
<br>
'fictive kinship'. These are terms from a Washington Post magazine
<br>
article. To put it way too simply (for contrast), 'raceless' blacks want
<br>
to fit in to american culture, study hard, and generally do well as a
<br>
result of this, especially among young people. (I note many many more
<br>
mixed groups of kids today than when (for example) I was in high school,
<br>
and regard this as a very good thing). By contrast, 'fictive kinship'
<br>
blacks see most if not all whites as the enemy, promote black culture,
<br>
and regard 'raceless' blacks as Uncle Toms.
<br>
<p>So I can suppose that 'fictive kinship' blacks see themselves as living
<br>
in an occupied state. In this scenario, 'raceless' blacks are
<br>
collaborators with the oppressive government, and can be thusly
<br>
considered legitimate targets. I would suggest that 'fictive kinship'
<br>
blacks are therefore targets for police discrimination, though what the
<br>
media reports is typically when this profiling results in a 'raceless'
<br>
black being stopped or detained.
<br>
<p>So if you're a well-dressed black person, who might be identified as
<br>
'raceless', your possible attackers could be a) muggers, b) white
<br>
racists looking to beat you senseless, or c) 'fictive kinship' blacks
<br>
that regard you as a collaborator. Of a, b, and c I gather the smallest
<br>
group is b. If muggers are mixed evenly by race, then there are still
<br>
more black people to fear than white people.
