<br>
<p><p>&quot;QUACKBUSTER&quot; SUED FOR $10 MILLION
<br>
<p><p><p>Richard Grossman
<br>
<p><p><p>Many of you will recognize the name Stephen Barrett, the self-professed
<br>
&quot;Quackbuster,&quot; because of his internet collusions with Michael W.Easley,
<br>
and his characterizations concerning fluoridation. 
<br>
<p>Some of you will associate the Barrett name with his lawsuits of
<br>
intimidation against Darlene Sherrell, and others, in an attempt to
<br>
restrict her from making public knowledge of his associations with special
<br>
interests in industry and other actions that portray his bias. 
<br>
<p>And many more of you will recognize Barrett for his attacks against all
<br>
forms of &quot;alternative medicine.&quot; 
<br>
<p>On Monday July 23, 2001, in what is expected to be a major blow to the man
<br>
who claims that he is the media, the publisher of Dr. Hulda Clark's
<br>
alternative health books filed a $10 million suit against Stephen Barrett
<br>
and others. 
<br>
<p>The supporters of this legal action (a cross-complaint) expect that the
<br>
process of discovery in this legal case will provide tremendous
<br>
enlightenment concerning coordinated schemes of harassment, discreditation,
<br>
and misinformation that have been applied to a wide array of health issues. 
<br>
<p>To view a complete copy of this lawsuit, and access a news release
<br>
announcing that a Mexican federal judge has ordered Dr Clark's Century
<br>
Nutrition Clinic, that was previously closed to be reopened:

Bolen's (JuriMed - Public Relations and Research Group) explanation: 
<br>
<p>Stephen Barrett, Self-Proclaimed &quot;Consumer Advocate &quot; Charged With
<br>
Racketeering, and Civil Rights Violations, in California... 
<br>
<p>De-licensed MD Stephen Barrett - who makes questionable claims of being a
<br>
retired psychiatrist, has long testified against, ridiculed, and warned
<br>
against, anybody that practices &quot;alternative medicine.&quot; He calls it &quot;health
<br>
fraud and quackery&quot; Barrett has labeled two-time Nobel prize winner Linus
<br>
Pauling as a &quot;quack.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Barrett operates a questionable website <a href="http://www.quackwatch.com">http://www.quackwatch.com</a> out of
<br>
his basement in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where he lashes out at what has
<br>
become the overwhelming choice for health care for North Americans - 
<br>
<p>&quot;Alternative Medicine.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Today - the tables were turned... 
<br>
<p>Some techniques he and his followers (known as &quot;Quack Busters&quot;) have used
<br>
over and over again against practitioners of alternative health methods,
<br>
are lawsuits, and threats of lawsuits. 
<br>
<p>Today, he and many of his group, have been named in a lawsuit filed by
<br>
Health Freedom Law attorney Carlos F. Negrete, in California. It is Case #
<br>
833 021-5.

<br>
<p>Barrett - who calls himself a &quot;Consumer Advocate&quot; has written many books on
<br>
the subject of what he views as &quot;Quackery&quot;. 
<br>
<p>He has managed to get himself a lot of attention as a self-proclaimed
<br>
&quot;Expert&quot; in Quackery and Health Fraud. Through his web-sites, his books and
<br>
articles and testimony, he has attacked many forms of leading edge or
<br>
alternative theories, including Chiropractic, Acupuncture, Homeopathy,
<br>
dietary supplements, alternative approaches to cancer treatment, and others. 
<br>
<p>The lawsuit was filed on behalf of New Century Press as a response to a
<br>
lawsuit filed against it by Barrett, et al. 
<br>
<p>====================================
<br>
<p>[I sez:]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;the publisher of Dr. Hulda Clark's alternative health books filed a $10
<br>
million suit against Stephen Barrett and others.... 
<br>
De-licensed MD Stephen Barrett 
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>What's the evidence for this alleged delicensing? An URL would be useful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
Barrett operates a questionable website
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Who questions it, and on what grounds?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
Barrett - who calls himself a &quot;Consumer Advocate&quot; 
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>This seems very unlikely. Surely he calls himself a consumer advocate, sans
<br>
the scare quotes and capital letters (usually a mark of a crank).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
he has attacked many forms of leading edge or alternative theories,
<br>
including Chiropractic
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>`Leading edge' is tendentious, precisely the issue under discussion. For a
<br>
view of the wicked technique (sometimes known as scientific method) Barrett
<br>
used to probe chiropractic claims, consider this:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.chirobase.org/01General/skeptic.html">http://www.chirobase.org/01General/skeptic.html</a>
<br>
<p>&lt; In 1973, Stephen Barrett, M.D., sent a healthy four-year-old girl to five
<br>
chiropractors for
<br>
a&quot;'check up.'&quot;The first said the child's shoulder blades were &quot;out of
<br>
place&quot; and found &quot;pinched
<br>
nerves to her stomach and gall bladder.&quot; The second said the child's pelvis
<br>
was &quot;twisted.&quot; The
<br>
third said one hip was &quot;elevated&quot; and that spinal misalignments could cause
<br>
&quot;headaches,
<br>
nervousness, equilibrium or digestive problems&quot; in the future. The fourth
<br>
predicted &quot;bad
<br>
periods and rough childbirth&quot; if her &quot;shorter left leg&quot; were not treated.
<br>
The fifth not only
<br>
found hip and neck problems, but also &quot;adjusted&quot; them without bothering to
<br>
ask permission. &gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The lawsuit was filed on behalf of New Century Press as a response to a
<br>
lawsuit filed against it by Barrett, et al. 
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Ah-ha! Here we come to an interesting turn. Barrett first sued a publisher;
<br>
the suit heralded in this puff piece is a *counter*-suit. Draw your own
<br>
preliminary conclusions.
