</em><br>
<p>I think philanthropy is beside the point, but you still make a good point
<br>
here.  The rich generally fund their own critics just like in _Atlas
<br>
Shrugged_.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Did you know that many people who travel to USA worry about getting ill

<em>&gt; &gt; while over there and accruing massive and crippling medical bills for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; treatment that in Australia or UK or Europe would be relatively

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expensive on the planet.
</em><br>
<p>On Miriam English's point above: the US system is NOT privatized.  It's
<br>
heavily regulated.  In fact, I bet it's the most regulated part of the
<br>
economy -- unless banking is more regulated than it.  The level of
<br>
government regulation and government subsidy in healthcare has been rising
<br>
since the 19th century.  The latter took a huge upswing after the creation
<br>
of the Medicare and Medicaid programs during the 1960s.  Before those
<br>
programs, a weeks stay in the hospital was affordable to middle class
<br>
Americans.  Today, this is not the case.  I don't think that's a coincidence
<br>
and there have been economic analyses done showing how government
<br>
intervention in healthcare is the main cause here.  (See, e.g., Sanford
<br>
Ikeda's _The Dynamics of the Mixed Economy: Toward a Theory of
<br>
Intervetionism_, pp134-6 and the references therein.)
<br>
<p>Blaming the free market for the failures of the welfare state here is
<br>
ridiculous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Part of the reason it is so expensive is because socialist health
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems externalize their highest costs onto our market, which drives up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demand and therefore prices. How is this done? By purposely rationing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive treatements such that the waiting lines for these treatments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are longer than the life expectancy of the patients, so they instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come here to the US, pay out of their own pocket to get treated, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their buying that treatment here drives up the price here for our sick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to get the same treatment.
</em><br>
<p>I think this isn't that big a factor.  I think US government intervention in
<br>
healthcare and subsidies to it are the main culprit.  Foreigners coming here
<br>
for treatments is, IMHO, just noise in terms of the costs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Don't get me wrong. I am not saying the US medical system is crap. It
</em><br>
has
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; its uses -- its advantages and disadvantages... but that doesn't make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better than other systems. In fact American medicine is becoming
</em><br>
irrelevant
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to large parts of its own society thru its inability to attend to the
</em><br>
needs
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the great numbers of poor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because the health market is being distorted by the externalities of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socialized medicine in other countries.
</em><br>
<p>Try regulated medicine here.  The US does not have a free market in
<br>
healthcare and it's certainly becoming less free each year.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
