<p>Don't give up.  Find the optimal use of your time and pursue it.  If
<br>
you have savings, right now is a good time to take a brief vacation
<br>
and pursue some cheap projects, or perhaps catch up on what tech skills
<br>
are in demand.  (Perhaps even have a friend &quot;hire&quot; you to do those
<br>
skills, such that you can claim &quot;work&quot; experience and give your friend
<br>
as a reference - preferably via personal email only, so friend doesn't
<br>
have to answer at work.  Of course, friend would not actually be paying
<br>
you, and you should actually use the skills to the point where you can
<br>
turn in a decent on-the-job performance.)  If you don't have savings
<br>
and need a job immediately, perhaps accept some low paying contracts
<br>
(fit for complete amateurs, but which you can do too) to tide you over
<br>
while you seek higher paying work.
