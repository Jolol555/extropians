I have been lurking on this thread, and here's my $0.02.
<br>
<p>First, it's bad law. Any law proposed by Congress is bad law until proven 
<br>
otherwise. We should fight it vigorously.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, this law will pass, because not enough people will care or 
<br>
realize the implications. What then?
<br>
<p>They are NOT going to start licensing compilers. The manpower needed to 
<br>
police that would bankrupt the government. They are going to make a few 
<br>
high profile arrests and try to cow the independent developers.
<br>
<p>They are NOT going to require licenses on software engineers. Industry 
<br>
would squeal loudly, and THEY have the lobbying power to succeed in their 
<br>
protest. This will be just like the visas fro foreign born engineers thing 
<br>
a few years back - US engineers were almost unanimous in opposition to more 
<br>
visas being issued, but the corporations wanted the cheap workers, so 
<br>
Congress obliged.
<br>
<p>There might be moves to license hardware, as has been mentioned, and 
<br>
outfits like Intel will be very happy to see the limits on competition. 
<br>
Since none of us have the resources to build our own processors, we will 
<br>
have to learn to work around this. Buy up as much state of the art hardware 
<br>
NOW if you are concerned. Parallel or clustered Pentium 4's might be a 
<br>
formidable tool against oppression some day.
<br>
<p>It's just another baby step toward the eventual police state. Why does this 
<br>
whole subject make me think of how they are trying to control &quot;g*ns&quot;? Black 
<br>
markets exist for just this reason.

<em>&gt;Back in my youth, I made a career error and ended up qualifying as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pharmacist. It took me a couple of years thereafter to realise how bad a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mistake this was for me, go back into academia, get a degree in something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I was _interested_ in (computer science), and start a new career.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I've just sent a preliminary enquiry to the Royal Pharmaceutical Society,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;asking about regulatory and educational requirements I'd need to meet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to go back into the profession. (I've got the Pharmacy degree and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sheepskin to prove I'm allowed to deal in heroin and cocaine in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;course of my lawful business, but I've been out of it for a decade and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;times have changed.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My reason?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I detested being a pharmacist. It damn near gave me a nervous breakdown
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before I realised that I had the option of jacking it in and doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something else instead. But if this law ends up going through, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;liable to kill my preferred profession stone dead. I need to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to earn a living, and counting pills is better paid than secretarial work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lest you think I'm exaggerating, consider that the implications of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;SSSCA bill would make it an offense to use a compiler or development
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tools that _could_ circumvent a protection device. Can you spell &quot;licensed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;software engineer&quot;? With random spot inspections to ensure that you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not using any uncertified, dangerous, free software tools?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This bill can't be allowed to go through and spread world-wide: it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be a catastrophe.
