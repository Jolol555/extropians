<em>&gt; &gt; Yes.  I like to challenge liberals with this problem:  suppose

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one of your billions of dollars to benefit the people of some
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have trouble relating to the &quot;liberals v. conservatives&quot; contest.  I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think either communism or capitalism is particularly democratic.  We  can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot better than we have done in the past - not by molding humans to fit

</em><br>
<p>This sounds so wonderfully polemic and sagely, but what does it mean?
<br>
You know, if you invent a system that works better than the free market,
<br>
you could win a nobel prize. Get hopping, oh sage one.
<br>
<p>I see this sort of sentiment among many of the dissillusioned liberals
<br>
of the 60's. Their fantasies about the 'workers paradise' of the Soviet
<br>
Union have dissolved in the dismaying light of truth like the Venona
<br>
File, yet they seem to still be trapped, emotionally, by socialist
<br>
propaganda about the free market which they in practice generally
<br>
understand little about. They desperately desire for there to be a
<br>
'third way', at least a third way that is unlike the slave labor
<br>
mercantilist oligopoly of the present day China. They are to distrusting
<br>
of individual humans, no matter how much they preach about 'loving one
<br>
another' (how can you love without trust?), to admit that leaving it to
<br>
individuals to solve individual problems may be the proper way to go
<br>
about it: libertarianism.
