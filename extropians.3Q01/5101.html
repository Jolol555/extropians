<p><em>&gt;The political task of transhumanism at this historical point must

</em><br>
<em>&gt;capital- and knowledge intense production, and accelerating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technological advances and their successful application (also from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a moral standpoint). This is achieved by a systematic transfer of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power from stasist structures to dynamist structures. We must
</em><br>
<em>&gt;identify, value, make conscious, and radicalize the groups that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are the bearers of such ideas. This isn't done by sitting in front
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;showing oneself in the right circles and the right palaces. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;groups that are the bearers of such change are mainly found in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;civil society, but also in the political sphere. To this scope we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need a cadre of dedicated, ideologically conscious and competent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanist that are active within, or in conjunction to these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;groups. The right persons giving the message in the right way and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the right forums. In sort the missionaries and the
</em><br>

<p>One of the most interesting and succinct paragraphs I've read in
<br>
awhile, welcome back.
<br>
<p><p>Thank you, Brian.
<br>
But the main point is to put it in practice, to provide the institutions for this to be accomplished and the right kind of discourse and I gave some suggestions for that in June.
