</em><br>
<p>Let's agree that thinking the material world as something &quot;bad&quot; is a
<br>
very strange notion (to say the very least), and that we do not think so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A cybergnostic would do this, although many people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are in practice cybergnostics have not thought through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these issues very carefully and simply reflexively say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that uploading is good. Once you start to pick at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question *why* uploading is a good thing, then much of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cybergnosticism evaporates.
</em><br>
<p>It's such a catchy term, &quot;cybergnosticism&quot;.  Can you say anything
<br>
further critical about it beyond the &quot;cybergnostics&quot; think that
<br>
the physical world is inherently bad?   Is there any reason that
<br>
we shouldn't co-opt (i.e. steal) the term from them?
