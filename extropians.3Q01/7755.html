<p>Why the hell not?  Great idea Mike.  Phalanx was developed specifically
<br>
as endgame defense against incoming missiles and possibly kamakasi
<br>
style attacks.  It is mature technology, proven at least in peacetime
<br>
conditions.  I saw a video of this radar guided gun in action.  It ripped
<br>
a drone F4 to shreds, then shot down the bigger pieces before they
<br>
could do any damage.  I suspect a phalanx on the roof of every tall
<br>
building and nuke plant would be more effective and possibly
<br>
cheaper than missiles.  spike
