<p><em>&gt; You understand that these words which are difficult, are all

</em><br>
<p>Yes.  &quot;Time-binding&quot; is a concept that was used by Korzybski
<br>
a lot in General Semantics.  I think that you mean the same
<br>
thing, namely, ..., well, I guess that the term is pretty 
<br>
self-explanatory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But is that possible? Yes, without time, you see. Is it possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for humanity, with its narrow focus on practicality, to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this insight, so that the old pattern of life is broken? We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have tried all this, tried every form of self-denial, and yet that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insight doesn't come about.  Once in a while there is a partial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insight, but that partial insight is not the whole insight, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is still partial ignorance. Which doesn't dispel the center
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the self. It may dispel some ignorance in a certain area, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the source of the ignorance, the cause, the sustainer of it, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still there.  Now what shall we do?  But this is a wrong question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This leads nowhere.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all!  Progress is merely, slow.  But not non-existent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have stated the general plan. And one has to make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moves, or make no moves at all. I haven't the energy.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't the capacity to see it quickly. Because this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediate, not just something that I practice and eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get.  I haven't the capacity, I haven't the sense of urgency,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of immediacy. Everything is against me: family, colleagues,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society.  Everything.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not 100% sure that I understand.  But I think that you mean
<br>
that the habits of all the people and institutions around you
<br>
constantly mitigate against any revolutionary change in thinking
<br>
that you would like to attain.  Is that right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And does this mean that I eventually have to become a monk? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No.  Becoming a monk is the same as becoming anything else. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Becoming a monk is like becoming a businessman.  I see all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this, verbally as well as rationally, intellectually, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't capture this thing.  Is there a different approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to this problem?  I am always asking the same question,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I am caught in the same pattern.  So, is there a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totally different way?  A totally different approach to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole turmoil of life?  Is there a different way of looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at it?  Or is the old way the only way?
</em><br>
<p>Until we may much better drugs, or until we have the singularity,
<br>
the old ways are the *only* ways.  Constant introspection, as you
<br>
are doing, is utterly necessary, I think.  It is to be hoped that
<br>
one's rational and logical mind prevails, though definitely *not*
<br>
unsupported by the emotions, which are crucial to reasoning and
<br>
to understanding. (E.g., see &quot;Descartes Error&quot;, by Antoniu Damiaso.)
<br>
<p>There is simply *no* revolutionary way of looking at it, *no*
<br>
totally different approach, or it would have been found long
<br>
ago.  All we have is a lot of people who have managed to persuade
<br>
themselves that they have discovered this key, this &quot;new way of
<br>
thought&quot; that solves the problem in a simple manner.  But it's
<br>
never happened, and I think never will until we have more direct
<br>
control over how our brains function.
