Is it possible that all the &quot;atrocities&quot; cause by Religion would just as
<br>
likely have happened for other reasons because religion was the excuse for
<br>
the acts, other excuses could have served the tyrants uses as substitutes?

<em>&gt; &gt; Arrg. Where to start?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hi M. E.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, if you don't want to start at the beginning, we can start at the
</em><br>
end:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is funny (to me) that this argument about religion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recurs on a yearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; basis on this list. &quot;Methinks he doth protest too much.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sounds like a personal problem (and probably not just to me), but not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly funny one. I protest that you do think too little. This
</em><br>
argument
<br>
<em>&gt; about religiosity recurs annually (or more often) because religiosity is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perennial weed in the gardens of extropy and transhumanism. To prevent
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; noxious weed taking over and strangling the useful plants, application of
</em><br>
some
<br>
<em>&gt; industrial strength weed killer does not seem inappropriate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I admit that the book in question (&quot;Why God Won't Go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Away&quot;) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; annoying in the sense that it frequently goes out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; its way to present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; its findings in the language of Western religion (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; title being an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; example of this), but I assume you actually did more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than read the title.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right, the dangerous and irresponsible nature of religiosity, causing (as
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; has) over five thousand wars in the last three thousand years, requires
</em><br>
more
<br>
<em>&gt; than reading. That's why &quot;drastic measures&quot; are appropriate. When dealing
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt; brain dysfunction, medication does a better job.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Religious fanatics are dishonest if they are not mentally ill, because
</em><br>
only
<br>
<em>&gt; psychologically disturbed people could believe the childish mythology of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miracles and fantasy that makes up religionism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I put it to you that the findings of the authors of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; WGWGA support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this bit of &quot;religiosity&quot;. Therefore, your mentioning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of this book,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the context of &quot;Debunk All Religiosity Equally&quot;, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wierd to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I suppose dealing with reason does feel &quot;weird&quot; to religious
</em><br>
fanatics. It
<br>
<em>&gt; would be irrational to think that religiosity can be debunked sufficiently
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; remove it from the ailing brain in which it resides. Therefore, one can
</em><br>
even
<br>
<em>&gt; imagine brains addled by religion hallucinating that the authors of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _Why God Won't Go Away: Brain Science and the Biology of Belief_,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Andrew Newberg, Eugene D'Aquili, and Vince Rause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ballantine, New York, 2001. 234 pp. $24.95, C$37.95. ISBN: 0-345-44033-1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in any way &quot;support&quot; religiosity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is arguably a central premise of certain religions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nice to be rid of &quot;the whole darn tormenting thing&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that is our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sense of being a separate &quot;Self&quot;, and that furthermore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; freedom is possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unless you are arguing with your &quot;Self,&quot; the sense of separation is
</em><br>
neither a
<br>
<em>&gt; premise nor arguable. Anyone with enough courage and honesty can conduct
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; experiment right now. It has _nothing_ to do with religionism. It has to
</em><br>
do
<br>
<em>&gt; with direct experience of reality. Simply allow all imagination and words
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; cease and desist, to fall out of view, to precipitate away from your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention, while you remain wide awake and alert, and suddenly it becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear that you are the world, all at once the constraints of dogma and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doctrine evaporate and you are free, and the walls that belief systems
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; put together fall down to reveal endless liberation in all directions. It
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; more a matter of seeing than of thinking. Religiosity, in stark contrast
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; this, is the first and last psychological prison of humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's very wierd (to me) that you even brought up this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (excellent)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; book in this context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it is the context which matters most. In the context of a world mad
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt; religious wars, where religionists are willing to die for the memes that
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; infected their brains, where the security of the entire planet is
</em><br>
threatened
<br>
<em>&gt; by zealouts who deliberately attempt to fulfill the apocalyptic prophecies
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; their sacred scriptures (at the expense of anyone who gets in their way),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where Inquisitions and witchhunts seek to silence every voice of reason,
</em><br>
where
<br>
<em>&gt; infallible popery masquerades as compassion, where innocent children are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taught to hate and kill anyone who does not embrace their parents pious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fanaticism, where parochialism and provincialism spawn divisiveness in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name of diversity, where nearly the whole human race is cognitively
</em><br>
crippled
<br>
<em>&gt; and lives in fear of tyrants who threaten damnation and eternal hell for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disobeying asinine religious edicts, where ceremony and tradition stifle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original ideas and new solutions, it becomes clear why the phrase &quot;to make
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; religion out of it&quot; means to alienate from freedom something that was once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beautiful and to deform it into an ugly form of psychological death.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However, on this list, not less than Mr. Max More
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; himself has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expressed the desire to be able to temporarily turn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; off his sex drive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a desire I fully understand. It would be nice to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; free of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whole darn tormenting thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Easily done. Try Paxil, Celexa, Zoloft, Prozac, or some other SSRI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The &quot;usual&quot; sense of self no doubt won out in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Darwinian sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because it drives us to actions which ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; result in more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; offspring, but then, obviously, so does the &quot;usual&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; state of our sex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; drives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, this is not at all &quot;obvious&quot; because our sex drives do not drive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Darwinism, Neo-Darwinian evolution, Deep Evolution, nor our sense of self.
</em><br>
The
<br>
<em>&gt; best way to transcend biological drives is to indulge them to the point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satiety, when doing so harms no one. The anti-sex facet of religiosity
</em><br>
results
<br>
<em>&gt; in repression, which leads to all sorts of perverse sexual behavior as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pent-up libido must find an outlet. That may explain why there are so many
</em><br>
sex
<br>
<em>&gt; perverts and pedophiles in monasteries, churches, temples, and mosques.
</em><br>
Sexual
<br>
<em>&gt; liberation threatens religionists because their particular type of bigotry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denies sex and sexuality, and this denial is yet another indication of
</em><br>
their
<br>
<em>&gt; dishonesty and irresponsibility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Thus, &quot;unusual&quot; brain states in which the boundaries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of our &quot;self&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are radically altered are not neccessarily &quot;less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; representations&quot; of reality. Perhaps they are like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equally valid reference frames involved when doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simple analyses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the kinematics of playing tennis on a moving train,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps you need to have a good orgasm to dispel these delusions. Sadly,
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; most &quot;unusual&quot; brain state in the world is one completely free of esoteric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speculation about reality. &quot;Different but equally valid reference frames&quot;
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; no substitute for the real thing, particularly when analyzing anything
</em><br>
about
<br>
<em>&gt; moving trains. If you ever come to your senses, you'll find that it
</em><br>
radically
<br>
<em>&gt; alters your analyses, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (Perhaps you should add &quot;the Self&quot; to your list of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; useless hypotheses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in your signature line.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for the suggestion, but &quot;the Self&quot; doesn't qualify for this select
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list, because no one really hypothesizes &quot;the Self.&quot; Instead, almost
</em><br>
everyone
<br>
<em>&gt; grows up inloading this delusion by cultural osmosis. IOW, it's a product
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary psychology and emotional conditioning rather than deliberate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis. Furthermore, you have demonstrated the usefulness of the
</em><br>
mirage of
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;the Self&quot; in the presentation of your comments here. You have written,
</em><br>
&quot;It is
<br>
<em>&gt; funny (to me) that this argument about religion recurs...&quot; Who is this
</em><br>
&quot;me&quot; if
<br>
<em>&gt; not &quot;the Self&quot; that you pretend to disown? You are quite caught up in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mirage of &quot;the Self,&quot; while admonishing everyone else to dispose of it. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cunning move, and selfish to boot, but to no avail.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Are our hearts part of our selves, when they can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; replaced with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; artifical pumps? Our lungs, are they part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ourselves? We need them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to live, but then, we also need all the plants out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there that produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the oxygen our lungs breathe, and we don't usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think of THEM as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; part of our &quot;self&quot;. We can't live without our local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; star, the sun,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (yet); is it part of our &quot;self&quot;? We can live without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our left hand; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it NOT part of our &quot;self&quot;? Just where does our &quot;self&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; end and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rest of the universe begin?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right. Everyone sing with the Beatles:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;I-am-you-and-you-are-me-and-we-are-all-together&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, who is asking these questions, and to whom are they directed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You've got the words down, but you've yet to act on them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The fact that, in these same experiences, the sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Self&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; radically altered does not obviously relegate such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brain states to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the category of undesirable dementia. The notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;self&quot; is really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a problem logically, as this list frequently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; demonstrates, when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; subject of &quot;uploading&quot;, et cetera, come up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's really no &quot;problem&quot; at all. It's merely an illusion that doesn't hurt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone else, because there's no one else to hurt. So... get over it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Obviously, SOME states can be argued &quot;a less accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; representation&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than others (death; sleep, etc.); but the kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; altered states that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are the focus of WGWGA involve heightened awareness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; surroundings,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; improved abilities, greater senses of well-being, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that extropians should find desirable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think extropians are capable of deciding for themselves what is
</em><br>
desirable,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;This fascinating and thought-provoking book by two neurologists and a
</em><br>
veteran
<br>
<em>&gt; journalist reflects the two physicians' long-term interests in the role of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious experience in the mind and its location in the brain. Their
</em><br>
studies
<br>
<em>&gt; were most often done with the aid of single photon emission computed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tomography (SPECT), a process in which the subject need not be in a
</em><br>
machine
<br>
<em>&gt; while it is working. SPECT allows all involved to work in an informal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atmosphere, which has undoubtedly made the results obtained more closely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reflect both religious and neurological reality. Early on, the authors
</em><br>
assert
<br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;biology, in some way, compels the spiritual urge.&quot; They know the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literature of their field and of religious experience, as well as the
</em><br>
history
<br>
<em>&gt; of the mind and brain. They write lucidly, analogize effectively and often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strikingly, and delightfully combine science and human interest. Their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments are cogent, and their observations and questions should keep
</em><br>
readers
<br>

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Book Description
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why have we humans always longed to connect with something larger than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves? Why does consciousness inevitably involve us in a spiritual
</em><br>
quest?
<br>
<em>&gt; Why, in short, won't God go away? Theologians, philosophers, and
</em><br>
psychologists
<br>
<em>&gt; have debated this question through the ages, arriving at a range of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradictory and ultimately unprovable answers. But in this brilliant,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groundbreaking new book, researchers Andrew Newberg and Eugene d'Aquili
</em><br>
offer
<br>
<em>&gt; an explanation that is at once profoundly simple and scientifically
</em><br>
precise:
<br>
<em>&gt; the religious impulse is rooted in the biology of the brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Newberg and d'Aquili base this revolutionary conclusion on a long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investigation of brain function and behavior as well as studies they
</em><br>
conducted
<br>
<em>&gt; using high-tech imaging techniques to examine the brains of meditating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Buddhists and Franciscan nuns at prayer. What they discovered was that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intensely focused spiritual contemplation triggers an alteration in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity of the brain that leads us to perceive transcendent religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences as solid and tangibly real. In other words, the sensation that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Buddhists call &quot;oneness with the universe&quot; and the Franciscans attribute
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; the palpable presence of God is not a delusion or a manifestation of
</em><br>
wishful
<br>
<em>&gt; thinking but rather a chain of neurological events that can be objectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observed, recorded, and actually photographed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The inescapable conclusion is that God is hard-wired into the human brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Why God Won't Go Away, Newberg and d'Aquili document their pioneering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explorations in the field of neurotheology, an emerging discipline
</em><br>
dedicated
<br>
<em>&gt; to understanding the complex relationship between spirituality and the
</em><br>
brain.
<br>
<em>&gt; Along the way, they delve into such essential questions as whether humans

are
<br>
<em>&gt; biologically compelled to make myths; what is the evolutionary connection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between religious ecstasy and sexual orgasm; what do Near Death
</em><br>
Experiences
<br>
<em>&gt; reveal about the nature of spiritual phenomena; and how does ritual create
</em><br>
its
<br>
<em>&gt; own neurological environment. As their journey unfolds, Newberg and
</em><br>
d'Aquili
<br>
<em>&gt; realize that a single, overarching question lies at the heart of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pursuit: Is religion merely a product of biology or has the human brain
</em><br>
been
<br>
<em>&gt; mysteriously endowed with the unique capacity to reach and know God?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Blending cutting-edge science with illuminating insights into the nature
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; consciousness and spirituality, Why God Won't Go Away bridges faith and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason, mysticism and empirical data. The neurological basis of how the
</em><br>
brain
<br>
<em>&gt; identifies the &quot;real&quot; is nothing short of miraculous. This fascinating,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eye-opening book dares to explore both the miracle and the biology of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enduring relationship with God.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From the Back Cover
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;This is one of the most exciting books I have read in my entire career in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neuropsychiatry and Intuition! Why God Won't Go Away shows how one key
</em><br>
area in
<br>
<em>&gt; our brain biologically wires us to be connected to each other, the
</em><br>
universe
<br>
<em>&gt; and God. Truly brilliant.&quot;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Over the centuries, theories have abounded as to why human beings have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seemingly irrational attraction to God and religious experiences. In Why
</em><br>
God
<br>
<em>&gt; Won't Go Away authors Andrew Newberg, M.D., Eugene D'Aquili, M.D., and
</em><br>
Vince
<br>
<em>&gt; Rause offer a startlingly simple, yet scientifically plausible opinion:
</em><br>
humans
<br>
<em>&gt; seek God because our brains are biologically programmed to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Researchers Newberg and D'Aquili used high-tech imaging devices to peer
</em><br>
into
<br>
<em>&gt; the brains of meditating Buddhists and Franciscan nuns. As the data and
</em><br>
brain
<br>
<em>&gt; photographs flowed in, the researchers began to find solid evidence that
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; mystical experiences of the subjects &quot;were not the result of some
</em><br>
fabrication,
<br>
<em>&gt; or simple wishful thinking, but were associated instead with a series of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observable neurological events,&quot; explains Newberg. &quot;In other words,
</em><br>
mystical
<br>
<em>&gt; experience is biologically, observably, and scientifically real....
</em><br>
Gradually,
<br>
<em>&gt; we shaped a hypothesis that suggests that spiritual experience, at its
</em><br>
very
<br>
<em>&gt; root, is intimately interwoven with human biology.&quot; Lay readers should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warned that although the topic is fascinating, the writing is geared
</em><br>
toward
<br>
<em>&gt; scientific documentation that defends the authors' hypothesis. For a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; palatable discussion, seek out Deepak Chopra's How to Know God, in which
</em><br>
he
<br>
<em>&gt; also explores this fascinating evidence of spiritual hard-wiring. --Gail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hudson
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, my point is that if we can locate the area of the brain responsible
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; religious ecstasy, perhaps we can also locate the area of the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for violent religious zealotry... and remove it like a wart or
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; tumor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What is important to realize is that the brain, in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very real sense,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; defines our experience of reality. All of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; experience with &quot;reality&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is mediated by the systems of the brain. That the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brain can be in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different &quot;states&quot; at different times is obvious; what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is not obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is why one &quot;state&quot; should be considered &quot;a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accurate representation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of reality&quot; than another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An important thing to understand is that the brain is the part of reality
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; has mistakenly considered itself a mystical essence instead of the organ
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; perception. If it is not obvious to you why an accurate representation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality requires a dynamic and pancritical rationalism, it is thankfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understandble to those who have tried to make it more obvious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The book in question (&quot;Why God Won't Go Away...&quot; =
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; WGWGA) reveals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how under certain circumstances (meditation, etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; certain subsystems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the brain temporarily &quot;shut down&quot; (and some others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; work more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actively), and some of the subsystems that &quot;shut down&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are associated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with defining the border between &quot;the Self&quot; and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universe. The authors propose that this explains why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the subject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; experiences &quot;oneness with the universe&quot;, etc, yadda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; yadda.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Meditation does _not_ mean the same thing as religiosity. It is
</em><br>
religiosity
<br>
<em>&gt; that needs debunking, not meditation. When neuroscience can pinpoint the
</em><br>
area
<br>
<em>&gt; of the brain that causes the dangerous and all too often violent behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associated with religious fanaticism, then it will have rendered a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beneficial service than locating areas of the brain which are active
</em><br>
during
<br>
<em>&gt; supposed meditation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This tends to &quot;debunk&quot; the premise of &quot;Debunk All
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Religiosity Equally&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but that should be obvious. (Would you propose to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attack all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; philosophies equally? How about economic systems; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equally bad?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may be &quot;obvious&quot; or seem that way to you, but I doubt it. I rather
</em><br>
think
<br>
<em>&gt; you know better, and that you're just trolling for a flame war. You are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably not stupid enough to believe that I'd propose anything of the
</em><br>
sort
<br>
<em>&gt; you mention. Your implication that I would do so belies your dishonesty
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; attempted deception.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Revealing that mystical experiences occur because this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; section of the brain temporarily does this or that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unusual thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; DOES arguably &quot;debunk&quot; CERTAIN aspects of CERTAIN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;religious&quot; beliefs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but it just as arguably ALSO does REINFORCE OTHER
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aspects of OTHER
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;religious&quot; beliefs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thank you for conceding that which is self-evident to any reasonable
</em><br>
observer
<br>
<em>&gt; (the first part of your rant), but this does not logically lead to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion of the last part of your rant. That fact that religious
</em><br>
experience
<br>
<em>&gt; resides in a part of the human brain in no way excuses the mass murders
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; mayhem inflicted upon the human population by religious fanatics and
</em><br>
zealots
<br>
<em>&gt; (the Crusades and the Inquistion to mention just two). One might as well
</em><br>
try
<br>
<em>&gt; to excuse the actions of rapists on the grounds that sexual gratification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operates in a particular area of the brain. The real value of Newberg's
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; d'Aquili's book is to demystify rather than to debunk the subject under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investigation. Debunking will, as I've mentioned, require stronger
</em><br>
research
<br>
<em>&gt; methods and correctional action. To conflate meditative experience with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious fanaticism is a cheap trick of the lowest kind. Shame on you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The book in question is in the same general genre as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Austin's &quot;Zen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the Brain&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The two books are in the same general category because they were both
</em><br>
written
<br>
<em>&gt; by authors who did not themselves directly experience the epiphenomenon of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which they write. While this seems laudable in that it appears to preserve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific objectivity, it corresponds to someone who has never had an
</em><br>
orgasm
<br>
<em>&gt; writing a book about love and sex.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You're argument has generally been that all religions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are bad and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should be wiped out (through force?), and then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; turn around and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recommend a book which presents &quot;mystical experiences&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in a positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; light, revealing how they have their basis in actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; occurrences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please re-read the subject line. It reads &quot;Debunk All Religiosity...&quot; Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over-reaction and defensiveness shows how weak you must feel. It shows in
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; way you twist this into &quot;wiped out (through force?).&quot; To reiterate,
</em><br>
&quot;mystical
<br>
<em>&gt; experiences&quot; do not equate to religiosity. Debunk means &quot;to render
</em><br>
ineffective
<br>
<em>&gt;  by exposing the false pretensions of,&quot; according to my dictionary...
</em><br>
which is
<br>
<em>&gt; what I've done about you. Since you are a troll, go back to lurking.
