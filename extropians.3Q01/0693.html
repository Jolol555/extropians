</em><br>
<p>A thoughtful and unusually clear explanation.  But to me the key
<br>
question is: is it *true*?  People have such a strong need to belief
<br>
such things that one must worry that they see it even when it is
<br>
not there.  Is Amara's strong acceptance of the events around her
<br>
best explained by her unconsciously arranging those events to give
<br>
her what she needs, or by her unconsciously deciding after the fact
<br>
that whatever happened must have been what she needed?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I believe that there is a deep wisdom in my environment, it only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;requires me to be aware of it, to look, to probe, to see, to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;as well. ... being in awe of all things *living*; ... often the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;me to be the most profound: footsteps in sand, the smell of garlic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and onion, hearing children laughing (or crying), and so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I believe that the answers (to any questions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that we have) are *in us* and *around us*. This is one place where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cultural history and mythology can play an important role. Humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have experienced and worked out amazing things, and their intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and emotional paths are in front of us, if we *only pay attention*.
</em><br>
<p>Although there is a purely emotive element here, there also seems to
<br>
be a factual claim here as well.  So again for me the key question
<br>
is: how *true* is it?
<br>
<p>To me one of the great tragedies of the human condition is that the
<br>
young largely ignore advice from the old.  Another tragedy is that
<br>
people are overconfident in their own wisdom relative to that of
<br>
other people.  So I can share some of Amara's awe in the wisdom
<br>
of people around us.  But the smell of garlic?  I fear that
<br>
seeing great wisdom in that is most likely wishful thinking.
