<p>Hmmm... nope. Maybe it is marketed under a different brand name in Oz.

<p>I don't know of any ulcer cures marketed here in Oz. It has been known for 
<br>
maybe a decade, maybe two, that the pylori(sp?) bacteria are the cause of 
<br>
stomach ulcers, but I haven't seen anything other than quackery about them 
<br>
at chemists (acid-neutralising alkalis, clay drinks, etc.) and quack 
<br>
palliatives are advertised heavily on TV and in the print media.
<br>
However I am not a doctor or a chemist (I'm a lowly artist) so I can't 
<br>
really say cure are not available. I will be stepping out today to go to a 
<br>
computer club, so will drop in on a chemist and ask about this.

</em><br>
<p>Yes. This is part of my point. Capitalism fails here.
<br>
<p>It is not really the fault of regulations either. The regulations are there 
<br>
for a very good reason: to try to eliminate unethical business practices 
<br>
and honest mistakes (think thalidomide). And those costs would come about 
<br>
one way or another eventually, perhaps by total distrust of all medical 
<br>
companies and associated loss of sales, or by insurance costs after mopping 
<br>
up disasters, or by general damage to the drug-buying public.
<br>
<p>What it comes down to is that the phamaceutical companies are motivated by 
<br>
money. That is neither a good nor a bad thing. But it does mean that 
<br>
humanity can't depend upon capitalism alone.
<br>
<p>This is where non-profit organisations shine. They help humanity where the 
<br>
money won't lure capitalism.
<br>
<p>I feel the need to repeat that I am not against capitalism -- I think it is 
<br>
very cool. I just don't think it is the answer to everything. And 
<br>
capitalism as religion scares the willies out of me, just as all religions do.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
