Extropes,
<br>
<p>I can't vouch for the authenticity of the followin,
<br>
but I choose to believe it genuine, as it reinforces
<br>
my experience that people have a deep wellspring of
<br>
courage, common sense, and compassion.

&nbsp;A Friends Return Flight 
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;I wanted to share this with you.... 
<br>
The following is from a letter by a professional
<br>
friend and her return 
<br>
flight to D.C. this week. 
<br>
<p>&quot;I just wanted to drop you all a note and let you know
<br>
that I arrived safe and sound into Dulles Airport
<br>
tonight [9/15] at about 6:00. It was an interesting
<br>
flight. The airport in Denver was almost spooky, it
<br>
was so empty and quiet. No one was in line for the
<br>
security check point when I got there so that went
<br>
fairly quickly, just x-ray of my bags and then a
<br>
chemical test to be sure nothing explosive was on
<br>
them. Then I waited 2 ½ hours to board the plane. What
<br>
happened after we boarded was interesting and thought
<br>
I would share it with you.
<br>
<p>The pilot/captain came on the loudspeaker after the
<br>
doors were closed. His speech went like this: 
<br>
<p><p>First I want to thank you for being brave enough to
<br>
fly today. The doors are now closed and we have no
<br>
help from the outside for any problems that might
<br>
occur inside this plane. As you could tell when you
<br>
checked in, the government has made some changes to
<br>
increase security in the 
<br>
airports. They have not, however, made any rules about
<br>
what happens after those doors close. Until they do
<br>
that, we have made our own rules and I want to share
<br>
them with you. Once those doors close, we only have
<br>
each other. The security has taken care of a threat
<br>
like guns with all of the increased scanning, etc.
<br>
Then we have the supposed bomb. If you have a bomb,
<br>
there is no need to tell me about it, or anyone else
<br>
on this plane; you are already in control. So, for
<br>
this flight, there are no bombs that exist on this
<br>
plane. 
<br>
<p><p>Now, the threats that are left are things like
<br>
plastics, wood, knives, and other weapons that can be
<br>
made or things like that which can be used as weapons.
<br>
Here is our plan and our rules. If someone or several
<br>
people stand up and say they are hijacking this plane,
<br>
I want you all to stand up together. Then take
<br>
whatever you have available to you and throw it at
<br>
them. Throw 
<br>
it at their faces and heads so they will have to raise
<br>
their hands to protect themselves. The very best
<br>
protection you have against knives are the pillows and
<br>
blankets. Whoever is close to these people should then
<br>
try to get a blanket over their heads. Then they won't
<br>
be able to see. Once that is done, get them down and
<br>
keep them there. Do not let them up. I will then land
<br>
the plane at the closest place and we WILL take care
<br>
of them. After all, there are usually only a few of
<br>
them and we are 200+ strong! We will not allow them to
<br>
take over this plane. I find it interesting that the
<br>
US Constitution begins with the words &quot;We, the
<br>
people&quot;-that's who we are, THE people and we will not
<br>
be defeated.
<br>
<p>With that, the passengers on the plane all began to
<br>
applaud, people had tears in their eyes, and we began
<br>
the trip toward the runway. The flight attendant then
<br>
began the safety speech. One of the things she said is
<br>
that we are all so busy and live our lives at such a
<br>
fast pace. She asked that everyone turn to their
<br>
neighbors on either side and introduce themselves,
<br>
tell each other something about your families and
<br>
children, show pictures, whatever. She said &quot;for
<br>
today, we consider you family. We will treat you as
<br>
such and ask that you do the same with us.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Throughout the flight we learned that for the crew,
<br>
this was their first flight since Tuesday's tragedies.
<br>
It was a day that everyone leaned on each other and
<br>
together everyone was stronger than any one person
<br>
alone. It was quite an experience. You can imagine the
<br>
feeling when that plane touched down at Dulles and we
<br>
heard &quot;welcome to Washington Dulles Airport, where the
<br>
local time is 5:40&quot;. Again, the cabin was filled with
<br>
applause. Last night I saw a program with college
<br>
students where one of them said that at their campus
<br>
there are no more hyphenated titles, i.e.,
<br>
African-American, etc., everyone is just an American.
<br>
No one will ever be able to take that pride away from
<br>
us. &quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
