<p><p>Interesting analysis, Robert. I've tried to digest it without reacting too
<br>
emotionally to the suggestion, and I see the point you are making.
<br>
<p>However, I would make some counter arguments...
<br>
<p>- First and foremost, how is terrorism setting back the singularity? Perhaps
<br>
I missed something in the recent deluge of posts, but I would see terrorism
<br>
perhaps, and war undeniably, as advancing the onset of singularity, if
<br>
anything. America, for starters, seems to function best when it has
<br>
someone/thing to rail against (be it terrorists or communists or something
<br>
equally nebulous). This is the time when the govt will begin to throw money
<br>
at technology in big grubby fistfulls (&quot;the government&quot;? possibly most
<br>
western governments). We may very well see a war ensue here, most likely
<br>
upon a nation which has only a loose connection at best to the WTC event,
<br>
which will be beaten before the war begins, and possibly will end with it's
<br>
capital dissapearing one morning, ushering in the era of nanotechnology in
<br>
the same despicable manner that the atomic era, in earnest, began.
<br>
<p>- To make such incredible martyrs of the population of Afganistan - a people
<br>
who have endured mighty hardships, only to be butchered by a former ally -
<br>
would galvanise the world into a war of such proportions that it would turn
<br>
anyone's blood cold to contemplate it. Imagine the world opinion of the US
<br>
if it were to take such action... the image of Nazi germany would be
<br>
forgotten, and replaced by a newer, greater evil.
<br>
<p>I've been quite impressed by Elizer's posts on this subject (much kudos!).
<br>
Here's a favourite snippet:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;samanatha (I think) wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; How exactly would this make future terrorism using suitcase or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; larger nukes or a bioweapon less likely than if we took out as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; many major terrorist cells as we can find?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eliezer replied:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Neither one will make it less likely, so we may as well focus on trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reduce some of the underlying hate by actually obeying international law
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for a change.  A moderate, lawful response by the US at this point, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;response that doesn't involve invading other countries just because we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get away with it, might have a real emotional impact in the minds of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries that believe, correctly, in the arrogance of the US.  That's how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Martin Luther King scored his victory.  Following international law even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;after a major bombing would send a message that the US is willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;choose to play by the same rules imposed on non-superpowers.  It wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;halt terrorism but it might decrease the growth rate.
</em><br>
<p>I can see two options for the US at the moment. Either go off to war (with
<br>
somebody???), or don't. If the US goes to war, we are in for dark times
<br>
indeed, because it is a war waged for the sake of vengence, which will be
<br>
answered with equal measure of the self same hatred. It is a war that will
<br>
not end until well after we have forgotten why it was begun, when the blood
<br>
which bathes the world drowns the memory of those who died in the WTC and
<br>
the pentagon. It may yet do some good technologically (nothing like a war
<br>
for that, as I've said above). But ultimately, no gain could balance the
<br>
cost.
<br>
<p>Or, the US can go find the guilty parties now, and bring them to justice, by
<br>
the book. Try them, before the eyes of the entire world. Show that the moral
<br>
highground isn't just something used to control the weaker countries, but in
<br>
fact is a standard to which everyone must hold themselves accountable, even
<br>
those few countries that need not. I can only imagine what such an
<br>
impressive action would do to unite the peoples of this world in proceeding
<br>
into what could become humanity's first century of civilisation.
<br>
<p>But there is still bloodlust to satisfy, and a question of jingoism
<br>
answerable only in the basest terms. There is nothing I can say to modify
<br>
any of that.
