The physicist Richard Feynman was one of the greatest geniuses of the 20'th
<br>
century and when he was in high school he had an IQ test. He got a mediocre 125.
<br>
The best definition of intelligence that I can think of is &quot; the sort of thing
<br>
that Richard Feynman did&quot;  therefore the disgrace can not be Feynman's,
<br>
it's the advocates of the test who should feel embarrassed.
<br>
<p>Years later after he became famous and won the Nobel prize the people at
<br>
Mensa wrote to him and begged him to join, he took great delight in telling
<br>
them that he could not, he just wasn't smart enough.
