</em><br>
<p>I agree. A very good film, actually. Michael Nyman's music fitted the
<br>
golden light and Lloyd Wright architecture perfectly to create a very
<br>
retro futurism. 
<br>
<p>As for the anti-genetic message, I think that was the message the
<br>
creators did try to convey. There was a sequence left out that showed
<br>
famous people that might have been geneteically selected away (from
<br>
<a href="http://us.imdb.com/AlternateVersions?0119177">http://us.imdb.com/AlternateVersions?0119177</a>):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short sequence which shows some famous people who may had not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been born if science had decrypted the human DNA sooner: Abraham
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lincoln (Marfan Syndrome) Emily Dickinson (Manic Depression)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vincent van Gogh (Epilepsy) Albert Einstein (Dyslexia) John F.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kennedy (Addison's Disease) Rita Hayworth (Alzheimer's Disease)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles (Primary Glaucoma) Stephen Hawking (Amyotrophic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lateral Sclerosis) Jackie Joyner-Kersee (Asthma) The last
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sentence is: &quot;Of course, the other birth that may never have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken place is your own.&quot;
<br>
<p>I think this pretty clearly shows at least some of the intention. But
<br>
like any good film, the story refuses to be simple. It can also be
<br>
viewed as a firm defense of the human ability to shape one's own life.
<br>
It is a bit like Shelly's _Frankenstein_, which is usually regarded as
<br>
being anti-science, but actually - even though Shelly might have been
<br>
ambivalent on this point - says that what was lacking in Frankenstein
<br>
was not research ethics, but that he did not think through and take
<br>
responsibility for the consequences of his actions. See the article
<br>
about it in last week's Nature, for example. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
The thing that truly made me love Gattaca was how the astronauts
<br>
dressed: a shuttle filled with people in suits and tie. The day we can
<br>
achieve that, space will be open to us. :-)
