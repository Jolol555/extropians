I was interested to see a journalist did a review of  _The Mummy Congress_ and so I decided to repost my take on the book.  As a cryonicist I think my thoughts I might be somewhat amusing in case some of you missed it.
<br>
<p>thanks,
<br>
<p>John
<br>
<p>While at my local Barnes &amp; Noble I came across _The Mummy Congress_ by 
<br>
Heather Pringle. She is a journalist who has written on archaeology in 
<br>
numerous magazines and this is her third book to date. 
<br>
<p>When her writing turned to cryonics she first gave a basic and helpful 
<br>
overview of it's history and mentions Robert Ettinger, Fred Chamberlain, and 
<br>
Eric Drexler. Nanotechnology is brought up though with some doubt thrown 
<br>
in. The cost for the various freezing options as well as how a cryonic 
<br>
suspension is done, all get covered. 
<br>
<p>I am excerpting where I think all of you would have by far the most interest 
<br>
to say the least! lol Get a load of this... 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From _The Mummy Congress_ by Heather Pringle: 
</em><br>
If nothing else, such state-of-the-art medical technology promises to churn 
<br>
out hundreds of wonderously preserved mummies in the future. I confess I 
<br>
rather enjoy the image of entire warehouses stacked full of Napster hackers, 
<br>
Yahoo programmers, and Apple engineers, complete almost down to their last 
<br>
DNA base pairs. But does ALcor's glorious vision of the future really mean 
<br>
that all these dot-com millioniares will be guaranteed their shots at 
<br>
eternity? It seems unlikely, for if the strange history of mummies shows us 
<br>
nothing else, it reveals just how much can go wrong when the dead are unable 
<br>
to life a finger to defend themselves. Even the world's most devout 
<br>
mummifiers, the Egyptians, were prone to horrible foul-ups. They switched 
<br>
bodies, took out all the wrong organs, slapped on too much boiling resin, 
<br>
and slipped bodies into too little natron, they tied together already 
<br>
rotting limbs with the Egyptian equivalent of duct tape, then concealed 
<br>
their mistakes under yards of linen. Then the most unscrupulous spent their 
<br>
evenings plundering those they had embalmed just a few months earlier. 
<br>
<p>Eternity, moreover, lies at the whim of future generations, and who knows 
<br>
what they will make of all these twenty-first-century mummies? Five 
<br>
thousand years from now, when nameless treasure-seekers crawl down into the 
<br>
eerie darkness of a long-buried warehouse and stumble blindly like moles 
<br>
into rows of giant stainless-steel thermoses, now rusty and bent and 
<br>
toppled, who knows what will happen? Will these fearless adventurers pry 
<br>
off the lids and see long rows of ancient saints with delicate perfect hands 
<br>
rosy cheeks? Will they, after offering up silent prayer, begin cutting out 
<br>
their hearts as sacred relics? Or will they size up this trove of ancient 
<br>
human flesh for its commercial potential and auction off its primeval DNA 
<br>
and untainted blood cells on some future version of Ebay? Will they view 
<br>
these strange corpses as some quaint curiosity of ancient earth technology 
<br>
and cart them back as trophies to molder in their own galactic museums? Or 
<br>
will they disdain all this fleshy debris as just selfish clutter, yards of 
<br>
human bubble paper that should have recycled long ago? And will they 
<br>
consign it to the nearest recycling bin? 
<br>
<p>Whatever they decide, there seems precious little chance that these rosy 
<br>
elders will sleep dreamless and undisturbed through the millennia. Mummies 
<br>
have always spoken to us on some deep primal level, and we are simply unable 
<br>
to leave them alone. We love them and we fear them, we aspire to be them 
<br>
and we dread that fate. But one thing is certain: we are powerless to 
<br>
resist their potent appeal. 
<br>
(end) 
<br>
<p>Well, we are going to have a field day with this! Where do I begin? lol! I 
<br>
would like to think the folks at Alcor and the other cryonics organizations 
<br>
will be much more diligent at protecting the bodies in their care then those 
<br>
ancient Egyptians who were less then ideal mummifiers! I believe those 
<br>
cryonically suspended will get their &quot;shot at eternity.&quot; 
<br>
<p>I respect the obsession the ancient Egyptians had with preserving their dead 
<br>
for religious purposes and in many instances they did this with incredible 
<br>
care and effort. Even in our day the amazing results they achieved can be 
<br>
seen and admired. 
<br>
<p>And I think if they could witness our cryonics organizations they would 
<br>
heartily approve. Probably many Egyptians given the choice would have 
<br>
chosen cryonics over mummification! lol 
<br>
<p>The scenario given where 1920's style explorers from five millennia into the 
<br>
future stumble into an &quot;ancient and abandoned&quot; cryonics facility is 
<br>
hilarious! Somehow I doubt people will be praying to our frozen bodies 
<br>
because they view us as saints. Especially, if they get the chance to read 
<br>
Cryonet! :) 
<br>
<p>As David Pizer carefully argued, there are a number of excellent reasons why 
<br>
a future society would want to bring us back. I see them doing it out of a 
<br>
sense of ethical responsibility and the desire to show off their cultural 
<br>
and technological achievements. 
<br>
<p>The whole idea reminds me of a King Tut parody which had future 
<br>
archaeologists digging up a roadside motel. They somehow &quot;pieced together&quot; 
<br>
that people of our day would put toilet seats around our heads while singing 
<br>
in religious ceremonies! LOL 
<br>
<p>At the very most it will only be one or two centuries before we can be 
<br>
reanimated unless civilization collapses due to war or natural disaster. 
<br>
This writer has not done her homework... 
<br>
<p>from the book: 
<br>
Mummies have always spoken to us on some deep primal level, and we are 
<br>
simply unable to leave them alone. We love them and we fear them, we aspire 
<br>
to be them and we dread that fate. But one thing is certain: we are 
<br>
powerless to resist their potent appeal. 
<br>
(end) 
<br>
<p>I thought the final paragraph she wrote on mummies(actually the cryonically 
<br>
suspended) was very powerful and honest. Though I admit to not wanting to 
<br>
be considered a mummy while I am in suspension! lol I do think mummies and 
<br>
by extension the suspended do have a very potent appeal which will work to 
<br>
our benefit. 
<br>
<p>I look forward to seeing what the rest of you have to say regarding what I 
<br>
excerpted from this book. 
<br>
<p><p>best wishes,
<br>
