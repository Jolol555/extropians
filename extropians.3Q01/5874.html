<em>&gt; Here's the only problem: I don't know what to suggest for a super-bright

<em>&gt; 10-year-old in 2001.  I was cutting my teeth on RAH's and Bradbury's (the

</em><br>
<p>A sufficiently high-powered 10-year-old has no need of &quot;juvenile&quot; science
<br>
fiction.  Susan Cooper, Diane Duane, Alan Dean Foster, Robert Heinlein,
<br>
Anne McCaffrey, and William Sleator can still be read and enjoyed, but
<br>
there's likely to be no real problem with going straight to Greg Egan.
<br>
<p>But in terms of good starters, I'd recommend:
<br>
<p>&quot;A Call To Arms&quot; by Alan Dean Foster
<br>
&quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; by Susan Cooper.
<br>
&quot;So You Want To Be a Wizard&quot; by Diane Duane.
<br>
&quot;Interstellar Pig&quot; by William Sleator.
<br>
&quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; by Robert Heinlein.
<br>
&quot;Tschai:  Planet of Adventure&quot; by Jack Vance.
<br>
&quot;The Complete Amber&quot; by Roger Zelazny.
<br>
&quot;The Uplift War&quot; by David Brin.
<br>
&quot;Dorsai&quot; by Gordon R. Dickson.
<br>
&quot;Pegasus in Flight&quot; by Anne McCaffrey.
<br>
&quot;Dune&quot; by Frank Herbert.
<br>
&quot;Retief at Large&quot; by Keith Laumer.
<br>
Dragonlance, &quot;Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Legends&quot;.
<br>
&quot;Advanced Dungeons and Dragons&quot;, various handbooks.
<br>
<p>And, of course:
<br>
<p>&quot;Engines of Creation&quot; by K. Eric Drexler.
<br>
&quot;QED:  The Strange Theory of Light and Matter&quot; by Richard Feynman (this
<br>
was one of my favorites when I was nine).
<br>
Collections of Martin Gardner's &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; columns.
<br>
&quot;The Moral Animal&quot; by Robert Wright (you're *never* too young to start
<br>
learning about evolutionary psychology).
<br>
&quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; by Douglas R. Hofstadter (ditto game theory).
<br>
&quot;The Incredible Bread Machine&quot; by R. W. Grant.
<br>
&quot;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman&quot; by Richard Feynman.
<br>
&quot;The Tao Is Silent&quot; by Raymond Smullyan.
<br>
<p>Don't forget to LEARN A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.  Do this as early as
<br>
possible while you still have the brain plasticity.  I recommend Python
<br>
followed by Java followed by C++.
<br>
<p>If you want to learn a foreign language, you have only one year left to do
<br>
it before puberty kicks in and your auditory cortex freezes over.
<br>
<p>Do stay away from:
<br>
<p>Stephen R. Donaldson
<br>
John Barnes
<br>
David Feintuch
<br>
&quot;Vampire:  The Masquerade&quot;
<br>
All of Heinlein's *later* books (this should go without saying).
<br>
The books Anne McCaffrey wrote because they locked her up and wouldn't
<br>
give her any food until she wrote more Pern novels.
<br>
Ditto, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman and the sophisticated AI devices
<br>
churning out upwards of sixty Dragonlance books per day.
<br>
<p>And if you read anything of David Eddings', borrow it from the library
<br>
rather than buying it, or make really sure you buy it used at a quarter
<br>
price, because you and all your friends will suddenly outgrow David
<br>
Eddings over a two-week period.
<br>
