I went and saw Ghostbusters III and really enjoyed the incredible computer 
<br>
animation!  Oh, I meant to say I went and saw Final Fantasy! lol!  This film 
<br>
was one part Ghostbusters, one part Aliens 2, and one part Starship 
<br>
Troopers.
<br>
<p>It was written and co-produced by the Japanese. lol  Considering the people 
<br>
involved in creating it, I was amused when Eliezer and others disliked the 
<br>
film for having eastern mysticism as a guiding plot element.  I guess you 
<br>
folks don't watch much anime! lol  Final Fantasy was state of the art 
<br>
computer animation with a classic anime plot.  So, none of you ever played 
<br>
the Final Phantasy rpg game for the Sega home videogame systems?
<br>
<p>I have to admit even with my Christian belief in the spirit/body dualism I 
<br>
was thrown somewhat by the eastern religious concepts in the film.  I wonder 
<br>
how many Christians(of whatever stripe) liked the idea of scientists 
<br>
fighting for the concept of there being something beyond the materialist 
<br>
view.  The film would definitely be too hard to stomach for most 
<br>
evangelicals. lol
<br>
<p>My four year-old friend I took along had a great time!  The neverending 
<br>
scenes of horrific monsters being shot at by &quot;the good guys&quot; was a big 
<br>
thrill for him.  He had no complaints.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
