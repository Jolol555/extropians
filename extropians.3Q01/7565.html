</em><br>
<em>&gt; By the way, what IS the extropian answer to war?
</em><br>
<p>Great question!
<br>
<p>The goal ought to be making war an undesirable option for any
<br>
government, organisation or individual. One proven way is trade: make
<br>
sure you can trade with the other side. Both will be better off, and
<br>
through specialisation they can reap greater rewards at the price of
<br>
becoming dependent on each other to some extent. This makes war bad for
<br>
business: in most situations you will be worse off if you attack the
<br>
other side than if you don't. Further, trade tends to promote cultural
<br>
exchange and creolization, limiting the us-vs-them tendency of humans
<br>
since they get to know the other side. 
<br>
<p>Combine this with open democratic societies, and the disincentive
<br>
becomes even stronger: voters and corporations will not want to lose
<br>
their investments in other nations by going to war against them, and in
<br>
democratic societies the government cannot easily act against the wishes
<br>
of the general population, at least not in this kind of situation. 
<br>
<p>Now, let's extend this to a proactive stance: decrease or remove tariffs
<br>
in general, but especially from marginally open societies so that they
<br>
get an incentive to open up (I think the recent decision to remove
<br>
tariffs from Indonesia to the US may be one of those events that at the
<br>
time look small and irrelevant, but in the long run will have enormous
<br>
consequences). The exception might be truly closed societies that sell
<br>
some basic products from regime-controlled businesses - in this case the
<br>
money simply supports the regime. 
<br>
<p>Encouraging openness can be done not just by governments but by
<br>
organisations and individuals, for example by distributing information
<br>
and tools useful for setting up an open society - be it tape recorders,
<br>
computers, providing microloans for cellular phones or cryptography. I
<br>
have always thought many relief and environmental organisations could
<br>
strengthen their stances on the open society - getting societies to be
<br>
more open and democratic is a great way of reducing the risk of famine
<br>
and environmental destruction.  Intelligent technology helps here, since
<br>
it can empower individuals tremendously. We don't need to wait for
<br>
nanotech, online communication is a good start. 
<br>
<p>Convincing people on a purely intellectual or cultural level that war is
<br>
a bad thing but not providing the incentives to change behavior will not
<br>
work as well. Ideas matter, but the ideas need help to flourish. 
<br>
<p>This is of course just a part of the overall extropian answer to war,
<br>
the part that deals with war prevention. Handling pre-existing wars,
<br>
helping war-infested cultures mature and what to do when you get forced
<br>
into a war still remains to be analysed. But I would say the extropian
<br>
principes have a lot of interesting suggestions we can apply with a bit
<br>
of creative thinking.
