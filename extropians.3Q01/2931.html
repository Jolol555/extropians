Hal writes, in a fairly detached and analytic fashion,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree with Harvey that the article was strongly racist, but I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he somewhat missed the point of the essay.  A few quotes for the benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of those who have lost it:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; You can pay me reparations, Johnny.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; To start with, I figure you owe me for three bicycles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The implication is that the bicycles were stolen by black people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that Johnny Cochran is therefore responsible because he is black,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a racist claim.
</em><br>
<p>I actually hadn't read it that way; I read too fast, I'm afraid,
<br>
and this accounts for some of my errors.  I thought of &quot;Johnny
<br>
Cochran, Jesse, and Al&quot; as just some three people.  All I had
<br>
understood was that they were in favor of reparations.  In this
<br>
case, it is a naturally (though overblown) reaction to say, &quot;Okay!
<br>
Where is mine?&quot;  or even, &quot;Blacks have committed more thefts
<br>
than whites---where are the reparations for that?&quot;  I do *not*
<br>
speak to defend either of those statements, but to rebut the
<br>
statement that the implication was that Johnny Cochran was
<br>
responsible because he is black.  (Perhaps I will not be believed.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; A few years back, my middle-school daughter brought home a horrendously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; misspelled science hand-out. Now, Johnny: You and I both know that it's easy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to make a typo, and write &quot;phenylkeetone&quot; instead of &quot;phenylketone.&quot; But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;feemelkeebome&quot; is stretching it. The errors were of this sort. An
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; understanding of chemistry clearly had never rippled the serene surface of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; woman's mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Without thinking, I asked, &quot;What color is your teacher?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His first unthinking reaction at seeing a bad misspelling was suspicion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the teacher was black.  This is a racist reaction.
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily.  There is a correlation between being a black
<br>
teacher and being an incompetant teacher.  The correlation may
<br>
be almost zero in some places, and quite overwhelming in others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; People in, say, Switzerland can walk their streets after dark. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can't. Why?  What have we got that they don't, that might cause fear?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The implication is that blacks are dangerous criminals, a racist claim.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  To lay this sad truth (about fear) at the feet of one race is racist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The white guy beaten to death 100 yards from my door last year - they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; never caught the killers, but - what you reckon, Johnny? Do you figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it was white Presbyterian women from the old-ladies' home?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The implication is that black people are more likely to beat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone to death than white people, a racist claim.
</em><br>
<p>This is an empirical claim, and it may very well be true.  I have
<br>
heard it reputably reported that racist black-on-white atrocity
<br>
obtains nation-wide attention much less frequently (if ever?) than
<br>
does white-on-black atrocity.  It is said that there existed in
<br>
Florida a black gang whose membership requirement was that a white
<br>
person had to be killed.  How can I ascertain whether this is true?
<br>
I do *not* trust the media to be objective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; As a result of slavery, you have been using our civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; without a license.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The implication is that black people are undeserving of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits of actions of previous generations purely because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their skin color, a racist claim.
</em><br>
<p>No.  It was the countering of an alleged ridiculous claim
<br>
(i.e. that reparations for slavery are due) with an equally
<br>
unfounded claim.  I do not believe &quot;undeserving&quot; was implied.
<br>
What was implied is that historically it so happens that
<br>
civilization happened to be developed far from areas indigenous
<br>
to blacks.  The further implication that somehow race is a
<br>
greater determinant than geography for the development of
<br>
civilization, if it's there, is racist.
<br>
<em>&gt; The real issue is that the essay is also intended to be read ironically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is meant to be a satire on racist attitudes.
</em><br>
<p>This is the first such reading I've seen!  Do you know something
<br>
about Fred Reed that the rest of us don't?  On what basis do you
<br>
claim the essage to be ironical?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It aims to mirror some of the claims made by those calling for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reparations in order to show how racist those claims are when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the racial roles are inverted.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry; I don't quite follow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the problem with the essay is that the attitudes it expresses,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; although meant satirically, are actually very close to real attitudes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; held by real people today and in the recent past.  Many white and asian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people DO believe that black people are thieving, stupid, violent, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undeserving.  It's not expressed very openly now, but a few decades ago
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people made racist jokes and remarks in public.  And views like these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die hard.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and what keeps them from dying, like so many false beliefs,
<br>
is the kernel of truth they contain.  The jokes wouldn't be funny
<br>
to anyone otherwise.
<br>
<p>As Jerry wrote
<br>
<p>&quot;You're not going to find anyone more individualistic than me
<br>
anywhere and I always try to look at a person [more] as an
<br>
individual than [part of] a group.  But I'm not going to pretend
<br>
that there aren't serious issues that need to be dealt with about
<br>
certain groups of people (not just US based urban blacks).  We'll
<br>
never solve them unless [we] identify them and face them head on.&quot;
<br>
<p>Because of polarization, it cost me some effort to say &quot;yes&quot;
<br>
when I had to above.  Why?  Because, being somewhat right of
<br>
center, I have an instinct to engage in the tug-of-war like
<br>
everyone else does, and to fall silent when I clearly see
<br>
that the liberals have repeatedly made some claim and got
<br>
some mileage from it.  But if I make an effort against
<br>
polarization, so can anyone.  Especially on the extropians list.

<p><em>&gt; P.S. From dictionary.com:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   rac·ism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   n.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     1. The belief that race accounts for differences in human character
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        or ability and that a particular race is superior to others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     2. Discrimination or prejudice based on race.
