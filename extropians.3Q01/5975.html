</em><br>
<p>Should the state enforce a monopoly on means of self-defense?

Should a state be empowered to prohibit self-defense or make it

nearly impossible except for a few martial artists?

</em><br>
<p><p>Then I suggest you don't open up the subject here.

<p><p><em>&gt; I simply say that

</em><br>
<p>Too bad.  Allies at what price?  The issue is human freedom and
<br>
self-determination.  It has many aspects.  That we agree to
<br>
group with others to stop one anti-freedom tactic does not mean
<br>
that any of us should muzzle ourselves about any other aspects
<br>
of such freedom that concern us.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am finding it difficult to think of even one person whom I know off this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list with whom I could use such an analogy to suggest that the proposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legislation is a *bad* thing. You might conclude that I am surrounded by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peer group of liberal intellectuals; perhaps so, but those are the people we
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We are going to limit the power of the state by granting that
<br>
the state should have unreasonable power over our lives?  Come
<br>
again?
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Are there better analogies we can look at? My own touchstones for laws that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack our freedom (despite being passed by modern liberal democracies) are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the political advertising legislation that was struck down as unconstutional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over here in the early 90s - which, among other things, would have prevented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any paid advertisements on political matters by ordinary people and lobby
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups, leaving the established political parties with a monopoly - and, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US more recently, the Communications Decency Act. Of course, we have all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these preposterous drug laws, but that analogy is not going to appeal much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more widely than the analogy with gun control. Just as most people don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like guns, most people don't like drugs. Mutatis mutandis for the proposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws against cloning.
</em><br>
<p>The drug laws are a very, very important analogy as nothing else
<br>
has so expanded the power of the state and so trampled on
<br>
individual rights in this country in recent times.  I am not
<br>
interest in emotional appeal to people's prejudice.  I am
<br>
interested in appealing to their self-interest and freedom and
<br>
the good of all of us.  I don't plan on combining work against
<br>
the SSSCA with all other subjects.  But I also don't plan on
<br>
walking on eggshells about what my views on other subjects are
<br>
in order to fight it.
