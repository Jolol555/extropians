Bill Gates could pay the whole estimated $20Billion in damages, and still
<br>
be left with somewhere between $20-40Billion for himself.
<br>
<p>Odd, huh?
<br>
<p>Buffett can say that calmly because like the individual companies, the
<br>
holding companies spread the risk.  If one reinsurer was too heavily
<br>
involved in insuring WTC area holdings, then there are a bunch that were
<br>
not.  The insurance and reinsurance businesses make such huge profits and
<br>
at such high margins, it's hard to feel sorry for them having to actually
<br>
perform the service they claim their business is structured to perform.
<br>
<p>I'm sure the industry will be fine, and they'll raise rates just to get a
<br>
little extra in the end and their huge margins will be fine in the long
<br>
run.  No need to cry for them, they're big boys, they'll be ok.

<p>Yes, I've heard that several european insurance re-insurors will be
<br>
spending $500-800 million to settle claims, and Warren Buffett calmly
<br>
said on 60 minutes last night that he expects at least one, if not more
<br>
of the insurance companies his Berkshire Hathaway group owns to go
<br>
bankrupt, or nearly so, paying off settlements.
