<p><em>&gt;Does anyone know whether the protection from childhood vaccination
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would help against the use of smallpox as a terrorist agent?  Is there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some technology to mutate the virus so that the vaccines don't work?
</em><br>
<p>Theoretically you could engineer the virus to alter its antigenicity.
<br>
You'd have to alter most of the proteins in the virus.  With something
<br>
as big as smallpox, that would be phenomenally difficult.  A chimeric
<br>
virus is a  little more plausible but still a big research project, and
<br>
if the chimera had the transmission properties of smallpox it would
<br>
likely share most of the antigenicity too.  So the vaccines will work
<br>
for some time against plausible release threats.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;One would think that smallpox would not be the biological weapon of choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against a population where perhaps half the people had been vaccinated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against it.  
</em><br>
<p>The high immunization is a strike against it, but otherwise smallpox is
<br>
almost a perfect biowarfare terror weapon.  Tolerates drying, ferociously
<br>
contagious, airborne, substantial latency (several days, IIRC), and
<br>
it's easy to immunize your own population.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The smallpox vaccine is based on the vaccinia virus (which is where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the name &quot;vaccine&quot; comes from), so I don't fully understand why
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concerns about smallpox virus availability required withdrawing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the vaccinia-based vaccine.
</em><br>
<p>Just speculating, but consider how the USSR would have felt about
<br>
a US smallpox vaccination campaign after it had been eradicated from 
<br>
the wild.  Turn it on its head and imagine how you'd have felt in
<br>
1989 if you'd found out the Soviets were immunizing their entire
<br>
population against smallpox.
