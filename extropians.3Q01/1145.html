<em>&gt; &gt; cannot imagine the possibility that the universe can be looked at in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; completely rational manner while simultaneously having a sense of awe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and wonder at it. They also have extreme difficulty imagining the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possibility that one could derive a set of values from objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rational observation of the universe that is anything but a rather crass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and simplistic dog eat dog existence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also have extreme difficulty imagining how one could derive a set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of values from rational observation of the universe, period.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that normal human beings come equipped with genes that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prejudice us towards a number of values, e.g., cooperation, altruism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; envy, and retribution, and sometimes when people &quot;discover&quot; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost everyone shares certain values, they go on to suppose that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these values are objective.  They're not.  The quickest way to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is to imagine aliens perhaps rather improbably derived from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite different environments.
</em><br>
<p>Which I have repeatedly asserted over the history of this list, and am
<br>
increasingly being corroborated by the facts, as is indicated by the
<br>
article Robert Bradbury and I have been discussing, is that any
<br>
technological intelligent species is going to be more like us than not
<br>
like us.
<br>
<p>Between the need for a large moon collision to enable plate tectonics,
<br>
to the need for an electromagnetic field, to a stable sun like ours, to
<br>
the evolution of eyes that see in the same spectrum as a result (because
<br>
that is the range that is most efficient for biological systems, and is
<br>
the peak output range for a stable main sequence star). The need to
<br>
evolve on a savannah for pressure to evolve large brains that can
<br>
survive baking heat long enough to reproduce, and to lack in evolved 
<br>
body weapons, which necessitates the evolution of hands to manipulate
<br>
materials to make tools and weapons.
<br>
<p>While intelligent species may evolve elsewhere, I argue that there is a
<br>
rather narrow path a species must follow to become a technological space
<br>
faring species.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is these cognitive failings in the religionists that I find most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; troubling,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course you mean *most* religionists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and is what I meant earlier when I said they are lacking. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; take great umbrage at the assertion that I lack in a sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aesthetics, that I don't appreciate beauty or human spirit, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because I choose to look at the world rationally rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from a position of superstition and supernaturalism. I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; need religion to be spiritual, and I don't need supernatural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; phenomena to feel at one with the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find this quite clear (and I even agree), except for what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean by &quot;spiritual&quot;.  As you know, the term evidently means very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many different things to very many people.  Such terms, it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me, might be better dropped from wide-ranging public discourse,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as this list.
</em><br>
<p>For me, 'spiritual' is about empathy and appreciation for the beauty of
<br>
the universe and everything in it. Mumbo jumbo has nothing to do with
<br>
it.
