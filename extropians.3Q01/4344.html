</em><br>
<p>I didn't say it would stay on track.  I said it'd wake up.  Friendliness
<br>
is *not* part of the spec on this one.  Brute-forcing an AI is an act of
<br>
pure desperation, to be committed only when the goo is on the way and
<br>
intelligent life is doomed in any case, in the hope of an objective
<br>
morality scenario.  If then.  Brute-forcing intelligence using any kind of
<br>
evolutionary algorithm is a hideously immoral act, immoral on the scale of
<br>
entire worlds; it's what Nature did to *us*.
<br>
<p>Leaving both morality and Friendliness aside, and considering it purely
<br>
from a technical standpoint, all that would really be needed is a
<br>
partitioning into million-brainpower computing partitions, a genetic code
<br>
that fills up those partitions with neural-network elements, and an
<br>
arbitrarily complex competitive game in which moves are signalled by the
<br>
outputs of those elements.  (You can make it a multiplayer social game and
<br>
bump up the chance of Friendliness by some very small fraction.)  Take an
<br>
idiot-simple neural network the size of a planet as the starting point,
<br>
mutate and recombine the genetic code randomly, and start playing with a
<br>
trillion-sized population of megabrainpower entities (megabrainpower does
<br>
*not* imply megamindpower, it refers to the number of computing elements).
<br>
<p>If the timescale is compressed a billion to one, i.e. the neural elements
<br>
operate at at least a billion times the speed of the neural elements in
<br>
the human brain, and if one generation undergoes a billion firings in a
<br>
lifetime, then two hundred generations would pass per second.
<br>
<p>I'd expect at least one superintelligence to be born before a million
<br>
generations had passed - five thousand seconds, less than two hours.
<br>
<p>The programming time would consist of writing the neural net spec, the
<br>
genetic spec, the evolutionary operator, and the game spec.  Efficiency
<br>
would not be an issue and the only requirement for any degree of initial
<br>
complexity would lie in the game.  The network spec, and the genetic spec,
<br>
and the evolutionary algorithm could all be extremely simple as long as
<br>
the genetic spec and network spec were Turing complete.  The steepness of
<br>
the hill-climbing algorithm, i.e. the ratio of successful to unsuccessful
<br>
mutations, is irrelevant when dealing with a computronium moon; that hill
<br>
will be climbed *fast*.
<br>
<p>Getting a non-lunar-sized piece of computronium to wake up is more
<br>
complicated.
