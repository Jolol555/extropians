</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (Lee, does this help you to understand how some of us might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; define spirituality?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it's probably also clear from what you and Samantha
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have written, that the meanings of these terms will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remain highly personal and non-objective.  Even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence for this comes from the way that I could relate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to quite a bit of what you'd written, but (for better or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for worse) never even coming close to utilizing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion of &quot;spirituality&quot;, and certainly not &quot;religiosity&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps.  But then much of value in life and much of the entire
<br>
concept of &quot;value&quot; for that matter, is &quot;non-objective&quot;.  That
<br>
is an important point.  
<br>
<p>I go into a state of awe in many similar places to Amara.  But
<br>
also when I consider all the self-aware consciousness of this
<br>
planet (human for now), all of the semi-aware consciousness and
<br>
what it can evolve into.  Have you ever felt the wishes and
<br>
cares and desires of a large group of humans at the same time or
<br>
felt the at-one-ness across the group?  Have you expanded it to
<br>
be as big as a campus, as large as a city, as a state and kept
<br>
expanding it inside as far as you can then a bit further and
<br>
then extended it back into your parents lives and then their
<br>
parents and then theirs?  Back and back picking up the
<br>
fundamental wishes and dreams and concerns of each.  Those who
<br>
made it possible that you could be here as their representative,
<br>
their hope who carries the torch of their dreams.  Then forward
<br>
into futures that we can create, into fulfillments of those deep
<br>
dreams and yearnings if we dare and if we grasp them deeply
<br>
enough and if don't dissipate the energy by fighting among
<br>
ourselves or trying to exclude some of us for other of us.  
<br>
<p>To me a lot of spirituality is about such expansions of
<br>
consciousness, attention and focus.  Can you imagine the
<br>
consciousness of what we will become and what we will give birth
<br>
to? Can you feel it reaching back into its own becoming?  Can
<br>
you feel the entire world becoming filled with intelligence and
<br>
self-awareness and yourself one part of that whole and of
<br>
greater wholes?  Does your mind, heart and being explode into a
<br>
whole world, then worlds and suns without end? 
<br>
<p>Can you see/feel/know all of that in a single flower or one
<br>
single snowbird sitting on a branch high in the sky in the
<br>
height of winter?
<br>
<p>If you can and do then you understand some of what I mean by
<br>
spirituality or what it means to me. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So are we homing in, by any chance at all, on a mutually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful meaning?  That is, it sounds to me that &quot;spirituality&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be for many of us---certainly not all---the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spirituality:  a deep appreciation of something so emotionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compelling that it becomes a form of reverance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, I must also candidly say that there is one huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem with any such explanation or definition, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's this:  many people will ADAMANTLY resist any such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduction to concrete words or concepts for these reasons:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  such an active reduction is itself rational/scientific,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     and therefore *itself* not emotionally compelling
</em><br>
<p><p>It is only reduction if it is claimed to be all that is meant. 
<br>
But you seem to be saying this is what it is for some of us.  I
<br>
think it is too weak to express what it is you feel when you
<br>
most love the things you mention or the thinks many of us
<br>
mention.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Some deeper psychology may also be involved, and relates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a statistical difference between men and women.  (It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no coincidence, according to this observation, that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; main defenders of &quot;spirituality&quot; here have been women.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some of us just do not *feel* it appropriate to discuss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our *feelings* about nature, or chess, or old movies, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe.  It seems wrong or inappropriate.  It can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even seem boring, as in, &quot;why the hell would anyone want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hear me rhapsodize about Tschaikovsky?&quot;  We have, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peculiar psychological reasons, some disdain for (vain?)
</em><br>
<p>How can it be &quot;wrong&quot; to discuss what most moves us?  Because
<br>
we have reason to be fearful of saying what that is or believe
<br>
we do?  Human beings do learn to belittle themselves and others
<br>
early on.
