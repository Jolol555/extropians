Lee said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I entirely reject the domain of aesthetic/cultural value as supplying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anything for the purpose of ferreting out objective truth and reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Does this make me, no matter how much I might publically value the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arts as both fulfilling and entertaining, and no matter how valuable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to human beings I believe emotions to be (because it benefits them so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and enriches their lives so), make me a proponent of scientism?
</em><br>
<p>Lee, I'd like to know a little bit more about what you mean by the first 
<br>
paragraph before I answer that question. :-)
<br>
<p>For example, there are some complex questions about whether it is possible 
<br>
to be objective in giving an interpretation of a work of art. I think there 
<br>
might be a sense in which you can be, at least sometimes.
<br>
<p>However, my answer to your question would almost certainly be &quot;no&quot;. Your 
<br>
second para seems to make pretty clear that you don't reject the 
<br>
aesthetic/cultural domain. My point wasn't about whether this domain is, in 
<br>
some sense, a source of facts about &quot;objective truth and reality&quot;. It was 
<br>
about whether this domain is *of value*. Moreover, I've tried to bracket 
<br>
off, throughout this discussion, issues of whether values are ultimately 
<br>
objective or subjective. I'm happy to discuss such issues, but they didn't 
<br>
seem relevant to the point I was trying to make to Samantha. I was actually 
<br>
trying to narrow the use of the term &quot;scientism&quot;, not broaden it to include 
<br>
people like you.
