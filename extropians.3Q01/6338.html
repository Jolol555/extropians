<em>&gt;From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Impact%20on%20History&In-Reply-To=&lt;200109131432.HAA18346@well.com&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;My reaction, on the whole, is that people are trying to forcibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make this into one of the most significant events in world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history.  I don't think it is.  Not intrinsically.  I understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the impulse to magnify the importance.  One doesn't want several
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thousand people to have died for something that doesn't ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change the course of history.  But I think we'll see similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;events in the future, and I don't think those will change the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;course of history either.  It's just a lot of unnecessary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pointless deaths.
</em><br>
<p>I have spoken to survivors of Pearl Harbor who say this is bigger.
<br>
<p>You seem to be missing the point. This is going to be a war against
<br>
organized terrorism, after this there may never be terrorism of the
<br>
sort we know now. There may be isolated cases sure, but the world
<br>
may come out from all this with the resolve to never let organized
<br>
terrorism exist in the world again.
<br>
<p>I'd call that significant.
<br>
<p>I think people are missing part of the significance of shutting
<br>
down air travel temporarily. Partly it is to prevent further acts,
<br>
but it is also to trap any accomplices, so we can round them up. 
<br>
<p>They are trapped here.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If the US does do anything real, militarily, it will probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;involve more death and destruction than was caused by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;destruction of the World Trade Center, dozens or hundreds of bombs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instead of two planes, dropped on some dirt-poor country far less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capable of dealing with the disasters resulting from each and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;every bomb impact, and the only real end result will be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hatred of the United States.  I don't expect that will stop the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;United States from doing it anyway.
</em><br>
<p>We want the people who did this, plain and simple, and we will stop
<br>
at nothing to get them. Anything or anybody who tries to stand in
<br>
the way will be destroyed.
<br>
<p>But that's not all there is to it, we want to eliminate organized
<br>
terrorism forever, period.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is pretty much how I expected the future to go.  If we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lucky, we'll make it to the Singularity inside the decade and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;won't see weapons of mass destruction used on major cities during
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that interval. But if we aren't that lucky, I won't be surprised.
</em><br>
<p>If we eliminate organized terrorism we may never have to face these
<br>
scenarios.
<br>
<p>An idea worth dying, (and killing) for.
