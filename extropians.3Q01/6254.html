<p>
Even if we can reduce the risks of aviation terrorism and other specific
<br>
mechanisms, we will obviously never be perfectly safe.
<br>
<p>Objectively, terrorism does not pose a significant risk to the life
<br>
of the average American.  Over 6,000 people die every day in the US.
<br>
We'd have to have a WTC disaster at least every couple of weeks in order
<br>
to significantly affect overall mortality rates.
<br>
<p>Given this limited impact, clearly terrorism is not about death.
<br>
It is, as the name suggests, about fear.  And fear is largely a matter
<br>
of perception.
<br>
<p>You don't need to kill 10,000 people to be a successful terrorist.
<br>
300 soldiers were killed in Beirut in the 1980s and it sent a shock wave
<br>
through the country.  6 were killed in the earlier WTC bombing in 1993
<br>
and it had tremendous impact.  It all depends on how people react.
<br>
<p>We will never be able to control terrorist attacks.  But we can have more
<br>
success in controlling our reactions.  The terrorist wants to instill
<br>
fear, but we can control our fear.  We can control how we react.
<br>
<p>I would suggest that it should be possible to learn to largely ignore
<br>
terrorist attacks, at least insofar as they threaten death.  The fact is,
<br>
the chances of them having a significant impact on anyone's lifespan is
<br>
extremely low.  Even if WTC scale attacks began happening once a month,
<br>
most people could more than make up for the increase in mortality by
<br>
starting an exercise program or going on a diet.
<br>
<p>The impact on infrastructure and the economic cost may be more
<br>
significant.  But that should not be a cause for terror, just for
<br>
irritation and anger.  We've lost a building and some talented people.
<br>
Our economy will be hampered for several days or weeks, and the
<br>
repercussions will be felt for longer.  This is an impediment to our
<br>
prosperity.  But we should not feel fearful about it.
<br>
<p>It may be that the sheer magnitude and scale of the WTC attack will make
<br>
the terrorist's job harder in the future.  Next time a building gets
<br>
bombed or a plane goes down, we may say, so what?  It's only 200 people
<br>
dead.  That's a drop in the bucket compared to what we've been through.
<br>
Not much more worth publicizing than a traffic accident on the freeway.
<br>
<p>I don't mean to say that we should be callous about death.  But rather,
<br>
we should recognize that we are surrounded by death.  Over a hundred
<br>
thousand people die every day, many of them unnecessarily even by
<br>
today's standards.  It's an inconceivable tragedy.  Just being alive
<br>
today, we face horrors from which I believe future generations will
<br>
shrink in disbelief.  Given this reality, the additional increment of
<br>
suffering a few terrorists can impose is relatively small.  We should
<br>
not give them too much weight.
<br>
