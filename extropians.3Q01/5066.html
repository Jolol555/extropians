<p><em>&gt; No.  I can't agree that we should agree to say that morality

</em><br>
<p><p>I am not so sure of that.  I think it is reasonable to speak of
<br>
morality being objective if it is based upon the nature of human
<br>
beings and human beings as social creatures in particular.  That
<br>
which is moral is that which strengthens and enable human beings
<br>
individually and collectively, that brings them greater peace,
<br>
productivity, well being  and however other many good things you
<br>
might list.  Now, is this list objective or not might be a
<br>
reasonable question and it might not.  We can't easily quantify
<br>
some of the things that might exist on that list.  But I believe
<br>
we could compose a reasonable list that almost all would include
<br>
as part of the &quot;good&quot; that a rational morality should increase.  
<br>
<p>If morality is grounded in the facts of human nature and of what
<br>
is required from humans to function well together then it is
<br>
objectively based imho.
