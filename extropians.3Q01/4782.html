</em><br>
<p>Well, enough about yours.  Stay on topic.  We are discussing
<br>
the heav'n-rescued land.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the idea of Americans as driven only by some crisp pragmatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunger for the next greenback is *so incredibly* ideological--
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, never mind.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, the point might not sail very well if made by one of
<br>
of the fish, so to speak.  But I thought that ever since De Tocqueville
<br>
it was understood that Americans were somewhat more, statistically
<br>
speaking, focused on making money than other people (in general).  No?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From <a href="http://www.freedonia.com/panic/detocqueville/detocqueville.html">http://www.freedonia.com/panic/detocqueville/detocqueville.html</a> :
</em><br>
<p>If the social field, for Tocqueville, was created out of the subterranean network of
<br>
prisons, the field of American empire truly became energized by the catalytic action of
<br>
the substitution of morals by money. Tocqueville recognized the telematic requirement in a
<br>
power field (as opposed to the hierarchical power of Kings and Queens) for a universal
<br>
transformer (a parasite) to precipitate motion in the system. If Tocqueville could note
<br>
that in America &quot;the first of all social distinctions is money,&quot; it was, perhaps, because
<br>
he saw so clearly that in the emerging American empire &quot;commercial wealth&quot; and the &quot;love
<br>
of money&quot; would combine with the exersize of power in a decentralized democratic field
<br>
<p>So my main point in
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; But unlike most Americans, who traditionally had their eyes only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; on the next dollar and were completely uninterested in &quot;theory&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the Japanese were very willing to do or die for the Emperor [etc]
</em><br>
<p>was about the pursuit of the almighty dollar.  But what caused your
<br>
spasm of hilarity was evidently the attempt at contrast with the
<br>
Japanese, whose patriotism is probably unequaled in the 20th
<br>
century.  No?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is hilarious to Aussies, say, who regard your panoplies of `patriotic'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parades, cheer squads and other hokey drivel, flags-clutched-to-hearts, O
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say do you [sees], military triumphalism, etc etc with uttermost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incredulity.
</em><br>
<p>Again, being one of the fish, I just don't see the difference between
<br>
that any what happens in most large nations, e.g., Russians at a May
<br>
Day parade, English singing God Save the Queen in 1901, French and
<br>
German super-patriots, etc.  American patriotism isn't what it used
<br>
to be, by the way.  You seem a little dated here.  It had a high point
<br>
in WWII, and was still pretty strong during the Cold War.  It's
<br>
definitely faded, and some people are upset enough about its &quot;passing&quot;
<br>
to have written books.  Saw some fellow on TV touting his a few nights
<br>
ago.  (He actually, though sheepishly, admitted that we probably
<br>
needed a war if we wanted it back!)
<br>
<p>But are we discussing the difference, again, between large and small
<br>
nations?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the idea of Americans as driven only by some crisp pragmatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunger for the next greenback is *so incredibly* ideological--
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, never mind.
</em><br>
<p>:-)  Oh please, do mind.  I need to be enlightened about this
<br>
very point.  I've grown up here a little bit annoyed that most
<br>
people seemed to be such materialists (in the bad sense) here.
<br>
Whereas I thought that Germans or English were, on the whole,
<br>
less so.  I never would have guessed that this was an ideological
<br>
position.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
