<p>You might remember. We were talking about global connectivity for

everybody on this dirtball, then, suddenly, about affordable broadband,
<br>
again for everybody, then, suddenly, about fiber, for everybody, then
<br>
about a lot of other things, mostly unrelated.
<br>
<p>Global connectivity for everybody (most values of everybody, at least) is
<br>
doable, fiber up every tree is of course another matter entirely. But, who
<br>
needs fiber up the wazoo, right now? I would take it, if I can have it, of
<br>
course, but I'd be pretty happy with anything above ~128/384 --
<br>
availability and flat rate would be much preferable to speedy, but cranky
<br>
connectivity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; telephone service, and the system we've installed and run is optimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for that.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, that's the system you installed, and which works right now. LoS
<br>
photonics, swarms of mass-produced and mass-deployed low-LEO microsats,
<br>
active beamforming, digital pulse radio, Ethernet to the home, they're all
<br>
different technologies, with different capabilities and different
<br>
pricetags.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When we're allowed to do something else, we'll build something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Since we're also the company that introduced cellphones in the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we know a thing or two about wireless, and the numbers aren't
</em><br>
<p>Wireless is a huge area, most of it is yet uncharted. LoS photonics and
<br>
digital pulse radio is wireless, and software radio routers are wireless,
<br>
too. I'm not aware of any company having competencies in all of these
<br>
areas, especially the lunatic fringe technologies like digital pulse
<br>
radio.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; there. We keep looking at it every day though.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We looked long and hard at Iridium, and at the others.
</em><br>
<p>Iridium is too expensive, of course. It deserved to crash and burn, but if
<br>
the feds were willing to bail it out for their needs, why not. Your taxes
<br>
at work, and all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any independent connection is refered to as a port, a cell tower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for example can only handle so many calls at once, so many &quot;ports&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>So, what if the end user devices themselves route packets? Connectivity
<br>
doesn't always require voice, SMS or a speech recognition system can send
<br>
a small text message, which doesn't have to have high QoS. High-QoS 10
<br>
kBps might be the limit for streaming audio, but streaming audio is a
<br>
niche, albeit a currently very widely used niche.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We look at high speed wireless everyday, and talk to our customers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyday, we have the curves plotted for every available technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared to what people have said they're willing to pay, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curves are nowhere near close.
</em><br>
<p>Have you heard about 802.11b and successor technologies grassroute
<br>
networks, based on Mobile Mesh, etc? About communities doing their private
<br>
Ethernet to the home projects?
<br>
<p>At least 802.11b based networks are very affordable, even given early
<br>
status of hardware development (I don't see why a mature 802.11b derived
<br>
router couldn't be sold for ~300-$400 in quantities, with zero operaton
<br>
costs but for the juice).
