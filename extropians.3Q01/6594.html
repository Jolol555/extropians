<p><em>&gt; &gt; America has no interest in being allied with Israel. Nor do we have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; significant commonality of values. Israel is more like the hated Muslim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; countries than like the United States.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the biggest differences, of course, is that Israel is a democracy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You may not like Sharon, Begin, Shamir, etc., but they were elected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by their people.  There are multiple competing parties and legitimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; campaigns.  Few if any of the arab countries can make the same claim.
</em><br>
<p><p>But the main reason the US must support Israel at all costs is that Israel
<br>
is its only reliable ally in a region that contains something like 2/3 of
<br>
the world's proven oil reserves. Even if the US  were not now totally
<br>
dependent on imported oil to maintain its economy, its economy is largely
<br>
dependent on foreign trade, which depends on oil obtained from a limited
<br>
number of locations worldwide.
<br>
<p>Oil is crucial in almost every industry from agriculture up. Without a
<br>
steady supply of oil at relatively low prices, there would be a transition
<br>
stage (to a new sort of economy) of a scope that is difficult to imagine.
<br>
<p>I may be missing something, but as far as I can see, major US involvement in
<br>
war in the middle east has been inevitable for some time; the 9-11 terrorist
<br>
attacks have made the war politically feasible, but they did not change the
<br>
basic situation.
<br>
<p>Because decisions are usually sounder when they're made with the greatest
<br>
possible understanding of reality, I think all of us who enjoy a &quot;First
<br>
World&quot; lifestyle need to acknowledge that it has been purchased largely on
<br>
credit, through the extravagant use of oil and that this has involved the
<br>
brutal treatment of a large number of people and will require ever more
<br>
brutality as oil becomes scarcer and more people want more of it (Asian
<br>
people, for example). Even if we could somehow educate the people of the
<br>
middle east and transplant our lifestyle to them, there would still be the
<br>
problem of not enough oil to go around.
<br>
<p>As long as we depend on oil, our whole way of life is fragile. Research into
<br>
alternative power sources, new kinds of food, fiber and fuel crops, new
<br>
agricultural methods, and lifestyles that do not require daily commuting
<br>
from home to distant work are, in the long run, more crucial than securing
<br>
sources of oil.
