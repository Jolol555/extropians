<em>&gt; Now, I think that there *is* an implication in that sentence that

</em><br>
<p>This is not a fact.  This is sloppy logic.  If you were working on an AI
<br>
database and wanted to code the logical &quot;fact&quot; that &quot;Mexicans are poorer
<br>
than business executives&quot;, I would object most vigorously.  This &quot;fact&quot;
<br>
would break a lot of the logical relationships of other &quot;facts&quot; and would
<br>
probably poison the whole project.
<br>
<p>It implies that &quot;all&quot; Mexicans are poorer than &quot;all&quot; business executives,
<br>
which is untrue.  It implies that the groups of Mexicans and business
<br>
executives are mutually exclusive which is not true.  It implies that
<br>
Mexicans cannot be rich like business executives, which is not true.  It
<br>
creates a continuum of wealth from poor to rich, but then uses the
<br>
descriptors &quot;Mexican&quot; for poor and &quot;business executive&quot; for rich.  These are
<br>
not comparatives adjectives for the same attribute.  One is really
<br>
describing race while the other is really describing job functions.  This
<br>
continuum uses the wrong adjectives and changes topic in the middle.  It
<br>
compares apples and oranges.
<br>
<p>This &quot;fact&quot; is so imprecise and sloppy that it invokes more logical
<br>
fallacies than it evokes truth.  It is logically inconsistent and
<br>
contradicts other facts.  Even if not meant to be deceptive, it is
<br>
misleading at best.
<br>
<p>This is the exact reason that statistical numbers for a whole group cannot
<br>
be applied to any individual.  It is one of the more common logical
<br>
fallacies.  It produces unproven conclusions through faulty logic.  It is
<br>
not so much a question of &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, but &quot;unproven&quot; because of
<br>
faulty logic.  The statement itself is invalid logic regardless of the
<br>
truthfulness of any implied supporting facts or statistics.
