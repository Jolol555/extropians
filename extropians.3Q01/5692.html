<em>&gt; &gt; Most of the countries that score higher than US kids on tests do so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specifically because they have a multi-tiered school system that weeds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; kids out around the 6th or 7th grade, sending the achievers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; university prep high schools, and those that don't to vocational high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; schools. The kids that take these comparison tests are only from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; university prep high schools, not the vocational ones, which is why they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; score so high.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While they don't exactly advertise it, most of the top public school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; districts in the U.S. do this too, with the predictable results that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look very, very good academically.  People who either cause trouble or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't making the grade are diverted to a second-tier school (nobody goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there unless they are sent there by the school district) that attempts to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn them into productive members of society rather than academic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superstars.  
</em><br>
<p>Round here, they generally don't do this, but we do have a higher than
<br>
normal population of private schools here, which those with money and/or
<br>
few enough siblings can afford, unless you live near one of the private
<br>
catholic schools, which are generally highly affordable. Of all high
<br>
school students (public and private), NH has consistently one of the
<br>
highest rates of SAT participation as well as highest average SAT
<br>
performance (this year, number one in participation and number three in
<br>
average score). Oh, and BTW: NH also spends nearly the least per student
<br>
on education in the country...
