</em><br>
<p><p>I don't think you would find anything interesting for a number of reasons.
<br>
<p>1) Explosives themselves have remained virtually unchanged both in power and
<br>
availability for better than a century.  The ambition of the terrorist is
<br>
the biggest limiting factor on the size of an explosion.
<br>
<p>2) There have been some very large explosions, due to terrorists and other
<br>
forms of malevolence, since well into the 19th century (from my own
<br>
knowledge) and probably as far back as the 18th century if I cared to look
<br>
it up.  Most terrorist acts utilize no more than a few pounds of explosives.
<br>
<p>3) The results of the explosives are heavily dependent on how well they are
<br>
used.  50-kg of high explosive in the hands of a creative genius will do
<br>
vastly more damage than 1,000-kg of high explosive in the hands of a moron.
<br>
Engineering is everything.  A couple pounds of explosives brings down
<br>
airplanes, but thousands of pounds have failed to wreck buildings (though
<br>
only due to incompetent application).
<br>
<p>Of course, if you want to talk about nuclear explosives, that is a different
<br>
story.  And completely hypothetical, though I don't expect it to stay that
<br>
way very long.
