<p><p>I know a lot of people really go overboard on the fat when on a low-carb
<br>
diet, but I can't do it.  I'm just too used to eating lean meat and
<br>
generally non-fatty food.  I still try to keep things healthy.
<br>
<p>Perhaps my better than normal experience health-wise with a low-carb diet is
<br>
because the food I eat would still be considered quite healthy, on a
<br>
low-carb or not.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; P.S. Oh, I DONT exercise even though I should. I am hoping that I will get
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; exercise is amazing! I calculate my target weight in a few more weeks. Wish
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>When I was in Army Basic Training, we had fat guys lose 40-lbs in 8 weeks,
<br>
carbs and everything.  Pure exercise weight loss.  Of course, I dropped to
<br>
about 2% body fat like most of the other reasonably skinny people.  You
<br>
can't help but to leave the place lean and tough.  I've never seen a such
<br>
effective weight loss programs as I saw in the Army, but maybe that was just
<br>
the Old Army. :^)
