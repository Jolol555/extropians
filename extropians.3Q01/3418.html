<em>&gt; This discussion just seems silly. It's extremely hard to swallow this line
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that white males are underprivileged in the US. In Australia, it seems to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that being male and white is the easiest thing in the world. Maybe things

</em><br>
<p><p>My impression has generally been that social welfare is more equitable in
<br>
Australia and Europe with respect to race than it is in the U.S.
<br>
<p>While I haven't seen it or heard it from older generations, who generally
<br>
have no complaint in this regard, I know many white people from my
<br>
generation (I'm in my late twenties), who grew up destitute and were
<br>
essentially ignored simply for the fact that they were white.  As far as I
<br>
can tell, this was only really noticeable to a relatively narrow
<br>
generational band, and even then, only if you were poor enough to fall under
<br>
the purview of social welfare systems, as I technically was.  I know of
<br>
several specific cases of covert and overt racial discrimination with
<br>
respect to public health care facilities that service the poor, that
<br>
discriminated against white people.  Circa 1990, I remember substantial
<br>
inequality of opportunity with respect to college admissions, especially at
<br>
the &quot;good&quot; universities.  I had a wealthy black friend with modest academics
<br>
get accepted to a well-known law school that had rejected one of my other
<br>
friends applying for the same program, a lower-middle class white guy with
<br>
excellent academics.  And this is just one of numerous examples from my
<br>
personal experience during that time.  This kind of thing left an impression
<br>
on people and I have many friends my age who can cite a litany of personal
<br>
experiences to this effect.
<br>
<p>Now, some of this could be attributed to overcompensation for allegations of
<br>
institutional racism in previous years, as many public institutions were
<br>
sensitive to accusations of racism at the time and were trying to avoid them
<br>
at all cost.  However, for the people who lived through that period and had
<br>
to deal with the system, it felt like institutional racism against white
<br>
people.
<br>
<p>Speaking unofficially for poor white people from my generation, most of us
<br>
don't really begrudge the fact that this went on; most of us found ways to
<br>
survive and sacrifice with the situation handed to us.  However, what really
<br>
pisses us off (and you see some of this on the list in these discussions),
<br>
is that we are being told that we are under some kind of obligation to
<br>
support this system financially, after being told to piss off by the same
<br>
system when an equitable social system would have given us some help.
<br>
<p>Things may be more balanced now (I wouldn't know), but I do see a strong
<br>
resentment of racial preferences of any type in caucasians of my generation,
<br>
largely as a result of firsthand experiences with an over-the-top program to
<br>
reverse racism with racial preferences in social programs.  This may very
<br>
well be an unintended consequence that will strongly limit the popularity of
<br>
any future race-oriented programs.
<br>
<p>Hopefully this broadens your perspective some.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>-James Rogers
