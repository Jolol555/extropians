<em>&gt; &gt; Russian slang could be part of his books simply because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Russkis were there first and because they launched 10-100 times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as much stuff into space as we did over many years.  Also, the

<em>&gt; &gt; Russians after WWII acquired as much (or more) of the rocket
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientist talent than the US did and pushed harder and earlier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for space exploration and conquest.  It would be very wierd if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there weren't Russian slang (at least) present in tales of near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; earth space.  Its absence would betray even more bias.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If Russia had so much influence on the Moon, then why is there not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ComIntern office there in the novel??? KGB??? GRU??? All of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities would have presences on the moon if it had that degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the Heinlein universe in which MIAHM was written, the US beat the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; USSR to the moon, and it is the UN govt that administrates it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't deny that it would be wierd if there were no Russian slang. My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point, which you don't seem to get, is that it is also quite wierd,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given the population of Chinese on the moon in the novel, that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely no chinese slang in the novel. This is a major oversight.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this is a very different point than implying that RAH was
<br>
trying to cozy up to the statist sympathies of the literati as
<br>
far back as MIAHM.  Desiring literary acceptance of SF generally
<br>
and as an author in particular and making plot/story decisions
<br>
to appeal to the literati are quite different.  Heinlein's sales
<br>
were quite good without the sanction of those you imply he was
<br>
playing up to.  I don't see he had a lot to gain and there was
<br>
more than a little to lose if his many fans noticed such.
