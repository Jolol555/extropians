<p>&lt;&lt; For this reason I am generally opposed to defining the homo sapiens
<br>
&nbsp;genome exclusively as 'human'. Any member of the homo group of species,
<br>
&nbsp;and any intelligences that evolve from them should be considered
<br>
&nbsp;'human'. Failing to do so I can guarantee will result in
<br>
&nbsp;luddite/transhuman race wars. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Maybe our descendents will agree on some kind of symbol, like Prince did, a 
<br>
few years ago? We can term ourselves, &quot;The Species Formerly Known as Human&quot;. 
<br>
I prefer we call ourselves, The Knights who Formerly Said &quot;Nyeah!&quot;
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;What is to be of concern is not how individuals see themselves, but
<br>
future problems of racism and discrimination as transhumans diverge into
<br>
many diverse paths, such that some humans will cease to consider others
<br>
to be 'human' if they are excessively focused on defining 'human' in
<br>
terms of physical appearance or mode of existence.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>One of tomorrow's many problems. Perhaps such issues might be forestalled, by 
<br>
implementing Hans Moravec's suggestion that truly EX-humans (former 
<br>
homo-sapiens) who desire massive configuration, such as being transformed 
<br>
into spaceships, seek their fortune in the solar system, and galaxy? They can 
<br>
surely trade material and data with earth, in order to upgrade continuously. 
<br>
Conversely, Ex'e's who dwell on planet earth as citizens, accept limitations 
<br>
on their power. An example might be: No Orion-type Nuclear Detonations within 
<br>
the atmosphere please.
<br>
Or, please-no hogging the datalines! 
<br>
<p>Moravec depicted homo sapiens and trans sapiens being protected by complex 
<br>
computer defense systems, also operating lasers to zap any suicidal attacker 
<br>
from beyond Lunar Orbit.  Eventually, when the galaxy spanning Minds become 
<br>
hyper-advanced, we will be absorbed, Borg-Like, with the intellectual 
<br>
collective. Curiously, Moravec stated that such entities and earth and its 
<br>
populace, along with their guardian defense systems, would continue on, as 
<br>
normal, not even knowing that they had been absorbed!   
<br>
<p>The upside to all this, as Moravec suggests, when we would find out, we would 
<br>
be living an even more cozy existence, with myriad's more opportunities to 
<br>
explore phase space (read: Life as Ascription), then in the normal humdrum 
<br>
universe. This is because the matter and energy to run our lives as 
<br>
observers/sensorialists/thinkers is astronomically, smaller then the physical 
<br>
masses now in &quot;real&quot; existence.  
<br>
<p>All this guaranteed, or your money back! Actually, I find this really 
<br>
plausible, since its conceptually science as we know it.
