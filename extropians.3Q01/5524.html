<br>
SEATTLE - Robots stole the show at the recent International Joint Conference
<br>
on Artificial Intelligence hosted by the American Association for Artificial
<br>
Intelligence.
<br>
<p>Besides the fifth annual RoboCup, which featured robots playing soccer, other
<br>
competitions included robots rescuing people trapped in a collapsed building,
<br>
interactive hors d'oeuvre-serving robots trying to be the most conversational
<br>
&quot;butler,&quot; plus a national Botball tournament among high-school teams of robot
<br>
builders from all over the country.
<br>
<p>&quot;We look to the natural world for inspiration; every stance must express an
<br>
intention,&quot; said Damian Isla, researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of
<br>
Technology (MIT) Media Lab, about his &quot;dog,&quot; Duncan, in the paper &quot;A Layered
<br>
Brain Architecture for Synthetic Characters,&quot; co-authored by graduate student
<br>
Robert Burke and professor Bruce Blumberg.
<br>
<p>Like Sony's cute dog robots, MIT's Duncan endears itself by design. The
<br>
animated canine can perform all the standard dog commands, plus he &quot;herds&quot;
<br>
sheep. More important, Duncan builds an internal model of his world from his
<br>
senses to perform unstructured commands like &quot;find&quot; a sheep that has strayed.
<br>
&quot;We chose a dog because they are very empathetic around people . . . and
<br>
canine psychology helped formulate our brain model,&quot; said Isla.
<br>
<p>The brain model permits Duncan to extract &quot;perceptions&quot; of objects from his
<br>
stream of raw sensory inputs and to formulate actions that respond
<br>
appropriately to those perceptions. To do all that, his brain model needed a
<br>
short-term memory in order to meld the senses of sight and sound and
<br>
coordinate the two in terms of locations so that an object's visual appearance
<br>
must come from the same location as its sound. From there an action can be
<br>
chosen and the navigation subsystem invoked to plan a route that enables the
<br>
action to be carried out.
<br>
<p>At the Seattle conference, more than 2,600 attendees listened to over 200
<br>
presentations, which included technical papers that fleshed out all the
<br>
aspects of creating a robotic intelligence in the likeness of the living, with
<br>
sessions like &quot;Cognitive Robotics.&quot; &quot;Spatial vs. Temporal Reasoning,&quot;
<br>
&quot;Causality,&quot; and &quot;Belief Revision.&quot;
<br>
<p>Whole sessions were devoted to such subtopics of cognitive modeling as
<br>
modeling with diagrams, modeling with categorization and modeling with
<br>
&quot;perceptual grounding.&quot; The newest approach, grounded models, differs from
<br>
past approaches in that it encourages the robot to synthesize its concepts
<br>
directly from its sensors. In contrast, previous robotic &quot;reasoning&quot; was based
<br>
on axiomatic systems - diagrams or categories - that were preprogrammed into
<br>
it ahead of time by their &quot;creator.&quot;
<br>
<p>Grounded models instead start with an empty set of categories that
<br>
self-organize depending on their sensory inputs. As explained by professor
<br>
Josefina Sierra-Santib of the Escuela Técnica Superior de Informática at the
<br>
Universidad Autónoma (Madrid, Spain), &quot;grounded models are based on
<br>
conceptualization of information gathered by sensors and support a form of
<br>
intuitive reasoning, which can become the basis of [self-organized]
<br>
axiomatizations.&quot; Intuitive reasoning, for Sierra-Santib, ensues when a
<br>
grounded robot tries to fit new sensory inputs into the categories it has
<br>
self-organized from previous sensory inputs.
<br>
<p>Other sessions covered specific types of cognitive functions, such as
<br>
planning. The planning sessions focused on improvements in traditional forward
<br>
chaining (deducing possible future events from current events) as well as
<br>
high-profile problems, such as dealing with incomplete knowledge and
<br>
uncertainty, or applying rule-of-thumb heuristics to simplify problems.
<br>
<p>New approaches
<br>
Several papers addressed combinatorial &quot;explosions.&quot; One such paper showed a
<br>
new approach invented by Emmanuel Guere and Rachid Alami, researchers at the
<br>
French National Center for Scientific Research's Laboratory for Analysis and
<br>
Architecture of Systems (Toulouse, France).
<br>
<p>Their &quot;Shaper&quot; algorithm solves combinatorial explosions in planning
<br>
algorithms by first simplifying a multidimensional task state space into a
<br>
&quot;shape.&quot; Shaper then used this distilled version of the data when comparing
<br>
competing task scenarios, thereby avoiding the &quot;explosion&quot; of different
<br>
combinations that result from planning with a fully detailed state space,
<br>
according to the authors.
<br>
<p>Machine learning sessions had separate tracks for hardware-robot learning and
<br>
software-agent learning, as well as tracks for reinforcement learning,
<br>
knowledge acquisition and inductive logic.
<br>
<p>Some research, such as the MinPath learning navigator for wireless personal
<br>
digitial assistants (PDAs), is already leading to practical real-world
<br>
applications. MinPath works by learning the behavior of wireless PDA visitors
<br>
to a Web site. It then suggests short-cut links to new visitors that can
<br>
drastically reduce their connection delays.
<br>
<p>This artificial intelligence consists of an algorithm that solves the &quot;deep
<br>
links&quot; problem for PDAs - that is, some Web sites make you click through a
<br>
series of descending menus that bog down bandwidth-limited wireless PDAs.
<br>
MinPath learns the short-cut links to deep-link locations that other wireless
<br>
PDA users have found helpful, according to the authors, professors Pedro
<br>
Domingos and Daniel Weld at the University of Washington, Seattle, and
<br>
graduate student Corin Anderson.
<br>
<p>Neural networks were cited in several papers as being instrumental in solving
<br>
unstructured problems, such as the so-called road-sign problem. Robots often
<br>
confront learning situations - passing a road sign, for instance - where they
<br>
should filter irrelevant information from the event stream while waiting for
<br>
whatever the road sign was warning about.
<br>
<p>Professor Fredrik Linaker from the University of Skovde (Sweden) and professor
<br>
Henrik Jacobsson of the University of Sheffield (England) described a method
<br>
that enables a neural network to learn information from a road sign and then
<br>
postpone responding to it until the cited event occurs.
<br>
<p>The technique involved abstracting to a higher level, where only events
<br>
grounded in sensory-motor interactions - rather than every perceived object -
<br>
enter the higher-level event stream. This trimmer, more relevant set of events
<br>
enabled a neural network not only to learn the road-sign problem, but also
<br>
enabled the robot to deal with unrelated intervening events, like the car in
<br>
front of it slamming on its brakes, without losing track of the sign.
<br>
<p>Of the invited papers, one by researcher Wolfgang Wahlster from the German
<br>
Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI; Saarbrücken, Germany)
<br>
described a European initiative called SmartKom, which is designed to enable
<br>
Europeans from one country to understand Europeans from any other country even
<br>
though they are speaking different languages.
<br>
<p>SmartKom follows on the heels of the VerbMobile initiative, which ended last
<br>
year. VerbMobile was a seven-year, $80 million effort to enable Europeans to
<br>
speak over the phone to each other with automatic language translation. But
<br>
according to Wahlster, DFKI will up the ante for SmartKom by adding
<br>
distinctive gestures to each of the English-, French-, German- and
<br>
Spanish-spoken languages. Communications will then be &quot;delegated&quot; to a virtual
<br>
assistant who will translate not only the speaker's language, but also the
<br>
natural hand-waving gestures of the locale.
