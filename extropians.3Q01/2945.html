I read up to page 6 (so far) of Frederick Mann's
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Report #TL07B: THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07b.shtml">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07b.shtml</a>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I haven't decided whether I will read any further.
<br>
Ironically, what stopped me was that the author didn't
<br>
seem to me to be displaying good thinking skills
<br>
at every opportunity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the best starting point is to compile an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THINKING SKILLS. Several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking skills are specifically mentioned in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above report.
</em><br>
<p>I should admit at the outset that I am by no means
<br>
so educated a libertarian as many people on this list,
<br>
and that secondly, I must quote a line from page 4
<br>
that I really liked:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; as George Orwell wrote in &quot;Nineteen-Eighty-Four&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Crimestop means the faculty of stoopping short, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought... crimestop, in short, means protective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupidity.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't that sum up amazingly well what each of us (hope-
<br>
fully less on this list) does when we get too near an
<br>
uncomfortable thought?  E.g., &quot;what if I've been wrong
<br>
about socialism?&quot;, or &quot;what if I've been wrong about
<br>
racism?&quot;.
<br>
<p>Mr. Mann spends most of page 3 and page 4 attacking 
<br>
reification, (the turning of particulars into abstractions
<br>
that goes too far).  He apparently believes that people
<br>
who lie on the opposite end of the political spectrum 
<br>
from himself have a problem with abstractions.  I think
<br>
that his philosophical position is called &quot;nominalism&quot;.
<br>
In any case, I believe in the reality of abstractions,
<br>
and among well-educated people, I am certainly not alone.
<br>
<p>But here was the first sentence that made me wonder if I
<br>
was wasting my time.  &quot;[The issue of the validity or legality
<br>
of the so-called &quot;Constitution&quot;] also means that all [sic]
<br>
the politicians and bureaucrats, calling themselves &quot;presidents&quot;,
<br>
&quot;secretaries&quot;, &quot;judges&quot;, &quot;generals&quot;, &quot;congressmen,&quot; etc., have
<br>
been liars and imposters masquerading as &quot;government&quot; (so-called).
<br>
<p>Evidently no alarm bells went off in his head when he wrote the
<br>
word &quot;all&quot;.  Moreover, there were no qualifications of the terms
<br>
&quot;liar&quot; and &quot;imposter&quot;.  That makes a very bad impression on me,
<br>
and in my experience indicates a communication problem, if not
<br>
a thinking problem.
<br>
<p>Ironically, in the post this evening, he writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that most people attempting to read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Nature-of-Government&quot;-type information have great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficulty processing the information because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lack the thinking skills for doing so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More specific thinking skills are mentioned in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other Clear-Your-Mind Reports
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/dir_clear.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/dir_clear.htm</a>&gt;.
</em><br>
<p>and so on.
<br>
<p>Then, so far as I could tell, he attempted to settle
<br>
the entire AIDS controvery by an appeal to correct
<br>
thinking, e.g.,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One thinking skill has to do with &quot;Identifying the Crux
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Matter.&quot; In the case of so-called &quot;AIDS,&quot; there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several &quot;cruxes&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Is there really a disease that can legitimately be called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;AIDS?&quot; (Or is it a linguistic fantasy created by definition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repetition, and acceptance by the credulous?)
</em><br>
<p>etc.  But I enjoy Korzybski, and so perhaps I'll enjoy this 
<br>
once I've acquired a taste for it.
