I enjoy my body, but am happy to see it replaced by a virtual one in the 
<br>
future. I don't so much see a mind/body dualism as a practical range of 
<br>
importance.
<br>
<p>My little finger is important to me, but I don't think it plays a very 
<br>
important role in making up who I am. My arm is more important to me, but I 
<br>
could lose it and still consider myself unchanged. I could swap my whole 
<br>
body for an virtual one and I don't believe it would impact my sense of 
<br>
self much. The brain requires a certain amount of input to avoid sensory 
<br>
deprivation but I doubt that is a great problem. I am sure such sensory 
<br>
feeds could be managed inside any computer capable of simulating a human brain.
<br>
<p>I already spend significant amounts of time &quot;inside&quot; virtual worlds where 
<br>
my sense of self is actually in those worlds. For those among you who doubt 
<br>
this, remember the last time you watched a movie and were totally sucked 
<br>
into that world with your real body forgotten, motionless in a chair?
<br>
<p>The body is important, yes... but not as important as the mind. Without my 
<br>
mind I am nothing. I like my body, but the time will come when I need to 
<br>
say goodbye to it in order to survive... I am OK with that... in fact it 
<br>
could be an interesting adventure.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Miriam

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
