<em>&gt; The problem with this is that most people use the word &quot;privacy&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to mean far more than self-ownership; they want to claim ownership
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ideas in OTHER minds as well.  If no one agrees with or is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in anything else regarding &quot;openness&quot;, at the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least we must clearly recognize the objectively different things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called &quot;privacy&quot;, and stop lumping them together as if they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unlike some &quot;transparency&quot; advocates, I totally support the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to keep secrets.  What's in your head is absolutely yours, and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have every right to do with it as you please, give it away, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep it locked up.  But I utterly reject any claim you have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control what _I_ can and can't do with information in _my_ head,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if that information happens to be about you.  As I said in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my talk, I would never sacrifice freedom for security, but telling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone else what to do with information in his own head sacrifices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HIS freedom for a sense of security that might not even be real.
</em><br>
<p>If we are going to be so discriminating, we need to discriminate by the
<br>
circumstances underwhich you came to know information about me, by what
<br>
relationship of confidence and trust was involved, and individuals must
<br>
consistently behave in a manner consistent with that trust.
<br>
<p>For example, selling web server information about me to anybody while at
<br>
the same time resisting on 'confidential relationship' grounds against
<br>
law enforcement obtaining the same information is logically
<br>
inconsistent.
<br>
<p>Similarly, a doctor refusing to provide health care information to, say,
<br>
a minor patient's parents, while at the same time providing that
<br>
information to sundry government agencies and insurance and drug
<br>
companies is similarly inconsistent.
<br>
<p>If you advertise a privacy policy, there should be legal remedies to its
<br>
inconsistent application, arbitrary adjustment, or outright abrogation,
<br>
that those who the information is about have a right to pursue with
<br>
meaningful consequences if the violator is found guilty.
<br>
<p>One method of dealing with this is to implement actual trust/reputation
<br>
brokers that are functional and deal with privacy much as credit
<br>
agencies deal with financial responsibility, and lobby the DMA to
<br>
require that its members post up-to-the-minute trust ratings on their
<br>
privacy policy page.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I cannot demand freedom for myself without granting it to others; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot demand freedom to speak without allowing those with whom I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree to spout their own drivel; and I cannot demand the freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to use every piece of knowledge I have to better my life without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; granting others the same freedom.
</em><br>
<p>Again, it depends upon what circumstances that information was acquired.
<br>
I could similarly claim that other people's right to life interfers with
<br>
my right to use my guns in every way possible, but that doesn't have
<br>
moral consistency. Similarly, the demand to 'the freedom to use every
<br>
piece of knowledge I have to better my life' falls under a similar moral
<br>
inconsistency without circumstantial covenants that are negotiable or
<br>
standardized between parties.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You happen to know what I look like, what I've written about,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what part of the country I live in, and many other things.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can profit from that knowledge, more power to you.  Most such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge won't be of any use to anyone, so protecting it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waste of time, but if I didn't want such knowledge to be used, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would spend my own money to ensure that they didn't get it.  Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further than that, I happen to think doing so is a waste of time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so I should benefit financially from the fact that I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; care who knows what about me, while more paranoid persons waste
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time and money hiding.
</em><br>
<p>Yet imagine that I made your views on secrecy known to individuals and
<br>
groups that depend totally on secrecy to do their vry profitable jobs:
<br>
intelligence agents, mafioso, and other assorted criminals, and showed
<br>
them a picture of you and gave them your address, in exchange for a
<br>
small fee for providing that information. I have thus put your life at
<br>
risk for money, which I don't think was your intention in letting me
<br>
obtain that information about you.
<br>
<p>What responsibility did I have, in obtaining that information about you,
<br>
to hold it in some level of confidency from those who might seek to use
<br>
it to your detriment? Freedom is not without responsibility, Lee, which
<br>
I think is the primary thing that transparency advocates overlook, it is
<br>
the means of self regulation that allows high freedom, high trust
<br>
societies to even exist.
