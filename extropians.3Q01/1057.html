<em>&gt; One source I looked up says that his _Sidereus Nuncius_, which reported the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initial observations was available in Venice &quot;by 13 March 1610&quot;. If we can't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come up with a better anniversary date, I'd go along with the suggestion of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 12 March. Anyone else got a better fix on any of this?

<p>In Venice on a holiday in 1609, Galileo heard rumors that a Dutch 
<br>
spectacle-maker had invented a device that made distant objects 
<br>
seem near at hand. A patent had been requested, but not yet granted, 
<br>
and the methods were being kept secret, since it was obviously of 
<br>
tremendous military value for Holland. 
<br>
Such an instrument would also be valuable to Venice, and Galileo 
<br>
determined to attempt to construct his own spyglass. After a frantic 
<br>
24 hours (according to Galileo) of experimentation, Galileo, working 
<br>
only on instinct and bits of rumors, never having actually *seen* the 
<br>
Dutch spyglass, had a 3-power telescope. After some refinement, 
<br>
he brought (August 1609, 21th) a 10-power telescope to Venice
<br>
(San Marco bell-tower) and demonstrated it to a highly impressed 
<br>
Senate (they could see a distant church, at Padua). Galileo's salary 
<br>
was promptly raised, and he was honored with proclamations. 
<br>
<p>[but that was not astronomy]
