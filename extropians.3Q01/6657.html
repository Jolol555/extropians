<br>
help people extend life, and so many lives were cut short by the darkness of
<br>
terrorism.  This tragic event has reminded us that freedom is precious, and
<br>
united us once again in the fight to preserve and protect this right.
<br>
<p>TO ALL OF LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE'S READERS, PLEASE REMEMBER THAT BLOOD BANKS
<br>
NEED YOUR HELP NOT ONLY DURING THIS CRISIS, BUT AT ALL TIMES. BECOME A
<br>
REGULAR BLOOD DONOR AND HELP SAVE LIVES.

<br>
<p>THIS WEEK'S LIFE EXTENSION RADIO TOPIC:  Depression
<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Low thyroid stimulating hormone a predictor of all cause mortality
<br>
<p>A ten year study pubished in today's issue of The Lancet revealed that older
<br>
individuals with low levels of thyrotropin, also known as thyroid
<br>
stimulating hormone, have a higher risk of mortality from all causes.
<br>
<p>Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are depressed in hyperthyroidism
<br>
due to a feedback mechanism in the brain that occurs when thyroid hormones
<br>
are elevated.  Symptoms of hyperthyroidism are rapid heart beat, elevated
<br>
blood pressure, excessive perspiration, nervousness, weight loss, diarrhea
<br>
and insomnia.  Subclinical hyperthyroidism is common, characterized by
<br>
normal levels of circulating thyroid hormones but low thyroid stimulating
<br>
hormone.
<br>
<p>Researchers in the UK measured the TSH levels of 1,191 individuals sixty
<br>
years of age and older who were not taking thyroid hormones or antithyroid
<br>
medication.  The baseline measurements were taken between 1988 and 1989, and
<br>
participants were followed for ten years.  During follow-up, 509
<br>
participants died, and cause of death ascertained.  This data was compared
<br>
to standard data for England and Wales, in which the expected number of
<br>
deaths for a matched group was 496.  Mortality from all causes was
<br>
significantly increased two, three and five years after the study's onset in
<br>
the 6% of participants with low serum TSH.  A large number of the deaths
<br>
that occurred were caused by circulatory diseases, particularly
<br>
cardiovascular disease, although cerebrovascular disease was elevated as
<br>
well.  Compared to participants who did not have low TSH levels, those who
<br>
had low levels experienced an increase in mortality from all causes.
<br>
<p>Overt hyperthyroidism is known to have an adverse effect on the
<br>
cardiovascular system, and sublinicial hyperthyroidism, often found in
<br>
people who take thyroid hormone replacement, may have adverse effects on
<br>
cardiovascular function as well.  The authors write that the study's results
<br>
suggest that even mild thyroid hormone excess predicts excess mortality, and
<br>
that individuals with reduced concentrations of serum TSH should be
<br>
considered for treatment to restore normal thryoid function. They note that
<br>
this study did not address the subclinical hyperthyroidism found in
<br>
individuals who are taking thyroid hormone replacement nor the importance of
<br>
the hormone dosages administered to this population.
<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Polymyalgia rheumatica
<br>
<p>Polymyalgia rheumatica is a systemic rheumatic inflammatory disease
<br>
characterized by shoulder and hip girdle pain that in some patients can be
<br>
associated with giant cell arteritis and other diseases. It appears that
<br>
polymyalgia rheumatica can be an early symptom of a wide range of diseases,
<br>
including rheumatoid arthritis, some cancers, and other degenerative
<br>
diseases.
<br>
<p>A recent study suggested that a thyroid hormone blood test be conducted to
<br>
rule out hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone). The tests most often
<br>
used to evaluate thyroid output are TSH, T3, and T4. Correction of
<br>
hyperthyroidism can reverse the disease.
<br>
<p>Standard therapy is long-term, low-dose use of the corticosteroid drug
<br>
methylprednisolone. This drug therapy has many side effects, including
<br>
excessive loss of bone density and severe immune impairment. A careful
<br>
prevention with calcium and vitamin D must be carried out systematically.
<br>
The demineralization can be limited by the use of Deflazacort, a
<br>
corticosteroid, which decreases the loss of calcium. One report suggested
<br>
that high intramuscular doses of methylprednisolone were as effective as
<br>
long-term oral intake of prednisolone and reduced the risk of bone
<br>
fractures.
<br>
<p>Since this disease is classified as an autoimmune disease, you may consider
<br>
following the Autoimmune Diseases protocol, which includes DHEA and
<br>
gamma-linolenic acid (GLA from borage oil) therapy. DHEA can also help to
<br>
maintain bone density and immune function.

<br>
<p>Thyroid deficiency
<br>
<p>(Although &quot;Life Extension Update Exclusive&quot; discussed the subject of
<br>
hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, or thyroid deficiency, is also a common
<br>
condition.)
<br>
<p>The thyroid gland lies in the neck, just below the Adam's apple. It measures
<br>
about 2 inches across and normally can't be seen. It can barely be felt upon
<br>
palpation. An enlarged thyroid, known as a goiter, can easily be detected by
<br>
a physician upon examination. The thyroid gland secretes hormones which
<br>
control the body's metabolic rate in two primary ways: by stimulating tissue
<br>
response in the body to produce proteins, and by increasing cell
<br>
oxygenation. To produce these vital hormones, the thyroid needs the element
<br>
iodine, which is ingested from food and water.
<br>
<p>The regulation of thyroid hormone levels is controlled by several
<br>
mechanisms. The hypothalamus, located in the brain just above the pituitary
<br>
gland, secretes thyrotropin-releasing hormone, which triggers the pituitary
<br>
to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). When the amount of thyroid
<br>
hormone in the blood reaches a certain level, the pituitary will produce
<br>
less thyroid-stimulating hormone; conversely, when the amount of thyroid
<br>
hormone in the blood decreases to a certain level, the pituitary produces
<br>
more thyroid-stimulating hormone.
<br>
<p>There are two forms of thyroid hormone. Thyroxine (T4), produced in the
<br>
thyroid, has only a slight impact on speeding up the body's metabolic rate.
<br>
Thyroxine is converted by the liver and other organs to triiodothyronine
<br>
(T3), which is the metabolically active form. Most of the T4 and T3 remains
<br>
tightly bound to certain proteins in the blood in an inactive form. The
<br>
body's continually changing need for more or less thyroid hormone will
<br>
determine the rate of T4 to T3 conversion and the release of bound T3 and T4
<br>
in blood protein. In this way, the body will maintain the proper levels of
<br>
thyroid hormone to regulate normal metabolic rate.
<br>
<p>The amino acid tyrosine is converted into thyroxine, or T4. This is the same
<br>
substance that doctors give as medication.

FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Bone Assure Capsules
<br>
<p>Bone Assure is a comprehensive formula that can prevent osteoporosis in 5
<br>
different ways:
<br>
<p>Protecting bone mineral mass by providing a potent amount of elemental
<br>
magnesium and a highly absorbable form of calcium (bis-glycinate) that has
<br>
been shown to assimilate 1.8 times better than calcium citrate.
<br>
<p>Maintaining the organic bone matrix with the minerals zinc, manganese,
<br>
silica and copper that are required for the formation of collagen and other
<br>
living connective tissues. Manganese has been shown to specifically act as
<br>
an anabolic catalyst in the development and maintenance of the organic bone
<br>
matrix.
<br>
<p>Facilitating the absorption of calcium into the blood stream by providing
<br>
vitamin D3. Once in the bloodstream, vitamin D3 then acts as a hormone to
<br>
direct calcium into the bone matrix.
<br>
<p>Preventing excessive urinary excretion of calcium and magnesium by providing
<br>
the trace mineral boron.
<br>
<p>Lowering toxic homocysteine levels that have been shown to damage the
<br>
organic bone matrix by providing small amounts of folic acid, B6, and TMG.

<br>
<p>L-tyrosine tablets
<br>
<p>L-tyrosine can be converted by neurons in the brain to dopamine and
<br>
norepinephrine (noradrenaline), hormones which are depleted by stress,
<br>
overwork and certain drugs. By replenishing norepinephrine in the brain,
<br>
mental energy levels are enhanced, some forms of depression are alleviated,
<br>
and a feeling of contentment often occurs. Because of the liver conversion
<br>
necessary for L-phenylalanine to have these effects, L-tyrosine is often
<br>
faster acting. In addition, the conversion step from L-tyrosine to
<br>
norepinephrine may be enhanced if the cofactors (vitamins B6 and C) are
<br>
included.
<br>
<p>Some of the norepinephrine will also be converted to epinephrine
<br>
(adrenaline) in the brain's adrenal medulla by use of S-adenosylmethionine
<br>
(SAMe) as a methylating agent. Since both norepinephrine and epinephrine can
<br>
cause smooth muscle (arterial) contraction, care with blood pressure should
<br>
be taken when supplementing L-phenylalanine or L-tyrosine.
<br>
<p>L-tyrosine is also a precursor of two thyroid hormones.

Life Extension is on its way to becoming a fact:  Alcor conference by Ivy
<br>
Greenwell
<br>
<p>Richard Morales, MD, specializes in antiaging medicine and runs an antiaging
<br>
clinic in Mexico. His approach to rejuvenation emphasizes trying to regain a
<br>
youthful synchronization of the circadian rhythms. This idea stems from the
<br>
theory that aging is basically controlled by the brain. Our primary
<br>
antiaging task should be to concentrate on restoring optimal function of the
<br>
central nervous system.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the most fascinating idea was that of a chronobiological diet. The
<br>
main principle is eating every three hours, with different nutrients
<br>
emphasized at different times of the day. The morning starts with fruit;
<br>
protein and complex carbohydrates are consumed later. While many
<br>
nutritionists would agree that small frequent meals are best, it would take
<br>
a lot of research to establish whether it is indeed best to start the
<br>
morning with fruit, and so forth. While researchers have designed a diet
<br>
that keeps expensive laboratory primates healthy and very resistant to
<br>
cancer, our lack of knowledge about what kind of diet is optimal for most
<br>
humans remains an embarrassing problem.
<br>
<p>Exercise is also a crucial part of the rejuvenation program. It's not
<br>
aerobic exercise, however. Morales believes in the special efficacy of
<br>
weight lifting as anabolic antiaging exercise, particularly if the leg
<br>
muscles are involved. The purpose here is to stimulate the release of growth
<br>
hormone. Exercise also lowers blood sugar and insulin levels, both of which
<br>
tend to increase with aging.
<br>
<p>Another way to stimulate growth hormone release is by increasing thyroid
<br>
activity. Morales referred to a &quot;thyroid promoter&quot; as one of his therapeutic
<br>
tools. Exercise also increases the levels of T3, the most active of the
<br>
thyroid hormones. As for steroid hormone replacement, Morales favors
<br>
transdermal delivery (creams, gels, patch). This includes DHEA.
