<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's a major misconception that extropians and other transhumanists lack of
</em><br>
empathy or even sympathy toward others.  Some on this list may feel that
<br>
way, but it's clearly a personal stance and not an extropian view.
<br>
<p><p>Fair enough. I've never seen such a lack of empathy in you, personally,
<br>
Natasha.
<br>
<p>What worries me, however, is that I've seen on this list an extraordinarily
<br>
high level of impatience with, and lack of imaginative identification with,
<br>
other people's current and historical sufferings. It's higher than I've
<br>
encountered in any other forum. Even posts about the history of American
<br>
slavery are met with quibbles about the number of million people who were
<br>
enslaved, whether some other countries were even worse, whether we can feel
<br>
guilt about things that were done before we were born (forgetting that if we
<br>
feel any vicarious pride in our respective countries and their histories, we
<br>
can certainly have this stained by *shame* at aspects of our their
<br>
histories... I don't know of *any* reputable thinker who seriously says that
<br>
*guilt* is what we should feel), adn so on.
<br>
<p>I have never claimed that anyone on the list is racist, but there is an
<br>
unusually high level of impatience, lack of imagination (of all things!!),
<br>
lack of empathy with racial issues, for example. Why is this? I can see
<br>
nothing in the extropian principles that underpins it. Indeed, I don't even
<br>
see how it follows from libertarianism. You can have all sorts of abstract
<br>
views about the moral limits on government interference with &quot;rights&quot;
<br>
without having such emotional attitudes to social tragedies such as slavery,
<br>
the destruction of non-European cultures, and the modern aftermath of
<br>
colonialism. If you are a libertarian and are sympathetic to disadvantaged
<br>
black communities (say) you'll simply have to respond with your own
<br>
charitable contributions or voluntary work, for example, rather than
<br>
lobbying for government expenditure.
<br>
<p>The tentative conclusion I coming to is that the problem is the other way
<br>
around: that (economic) libertarianism - which has *some* links with
<br>
extropianism, even if only of an historical nature - is attractive to, among
<br>
others, those who already have the emotional responses I've described.
<br>
<p>Perhaps there is a sense in which none of this matters for the cause of
<br>
transhumanism. However, I'd like to think that transhumanism can be linked
<br>
to other values that intellectually engaged and emotionally decent people
<br>
take seriously. I dread to think what impression is being created in the
<br>
minds of any postgraduate students - the public intellectuals of tomorrow -
<br>
who might be poring over the list's archives trying to understand
<br>
transhumanism from a sociological or similar perspective. If they do come to
<br>
a misconception that transhumanism is linked to inhumane attitudes, I'd say
<br>
they'd have some justification for it.
