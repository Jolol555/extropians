<p>If you look earlier at the message you are quoting you see:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Robert writes, to Scientific American, about Whitesides' article
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at <a href="http://www.sciam.com/2001/0901issue/0901whitesides.html">http://www.sciam.com/2001/0901issue/0901whitesides.html</a>:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; similarity between flagellar and electrical motors is, however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; largely illusory.&quot;  While he was wrong about ATP, his basic point was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; correct that unlike macro-scale motors, the flagellar motor is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; magnetic. It is apparently electrostatic, and/or may rely on changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in shapes of proteins; the details are not known.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the argument?
</em><br>
<p>Well, the specific point is that Whitesides said that the flagellum
<br>
is powered by ATP, and Robert is pointing out that it is powered by a
<br>
proton gradient instead (some cells apparently use sodium ion gradient).
<br>
<p>Whitesides' larger point is quoted mostly above, that the similarity
<br>
between the flagellar and electric motors is &quot;largely illusory&quot; because
<br>
electric motors are magnetic.  Everything about their design is oriented
<br>
towards organizing the magnetic fields to induce rotary motion.  However
<br>
magnetic fields don't work that well at the nanoscale and do not drive
<br>
the flagellar motor.  Hence his claim that they are not really all that
<br>
similar in their operating principles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Also, the proton gradient itself is presumably maintained by molecular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pumps powered by ATP, so there is a sense in which Whitesides'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; statement can be interpreted as being correct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, what is the argument?
</em><br>
<p>Just that in a sense Whitesides' claim that the motor was powered by ATP
<br>
was correct in the ultimate sense, if ATP maintains the proton gradient
<br>
that drives the motor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I think it would be relevant here to list the specific criticisms that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Whitesides made based on this misconception of submarine size, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; order to show that they would not be relevant.  It seemed that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; main point made by Whitesides with regards to the size of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; submarine was the difficulty in navigation due to Brownian motion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, bacteria manage to navigate nicely using flagellar propulsion within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animal cells, so I don't see why an array of electrostatic motors with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bucky or sapphire fibers sticking out wouldn't make for a rather speedy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanosub.
</em><br>
<p>Freitas points out that bacteria smaller than about 0.6 microns don't
<br>
swim, below that size &quot;locomotion has no apparent benefit&quot; (9.4.2.4
<br>
of Nanomedicine).  So Whitesides' error was in misunderstanding the
<br>
intended size of nanobots; his reasoning would be correct for the 0.1
<br>
micron size he was describing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Your references rely pretty heavily on Freitas.  Another article I like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is Merkle's hydrocarbon metabolism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/hydroCarbonMetabolism.html">http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/hydroCarbonMetabolism.html</a>, which is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; best article I've seen to address the &quot;grabbing atoms&quot; issue.  He shows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specific molecular structures for reactive tools which can be used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; add or remove hydrogen and carbon atoms, as well as to build more of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the tools.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem with this is that you use reactive moieties attached to rigid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rods which imply bulk (which he sidesteps by showing them as quadratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blocks), which have to touch down at a surface (one hemisphere of space is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hence unaccessible). Several of the moieties much be present at the site
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simultaneously, which is difficult to steric hindrance which he refers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the fat fingers problem. Plus you have to cycle the rods, retracting,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recycling and protruding them again in a rapid oscillation, which implies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have to minimize bulk, or be slow and burn a lot of juice.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that the rigid rods would have to be all that bulky.
<br>
Merkle is just showing the end structures and they are quite thin.
<br>
You don't have to get too fat to have strong rods, and in fact the tools
<br>
used by Merkle don't seem to require huge forces anyway.
<br>
<p>As for speed, that's not really an issue at this level of design.
<br>
Merkle's main point was to show that you could come up with tools that
<br>
would do the job.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is unelegant. What would make more sense is a nanolithoprinter, using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a flexible hollow (e.g. graphene) duct to transport monomers and a head
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with an aperture aligning them and activating them with a current pulse,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least initially (when you've got a cluster bristling with radicals you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can just firehose your allenes at it, and they will stick). That may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give you atomic control, but when do you really need atomic control? I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no showstoppers even if you can deposit only a tiny subset of all possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structures, as long as the repertoire is sufficiently rich.
</em><br>
<p>The point of Merkle's analysis was to show how you could have a tool
<br>
set that could build carbon structures, and, most importantly, also
<br>
build more copies of the tools.  This is the crucial element necessary
<br>
for self replication and to my knowledge no other paper has showed a
<br>
specific design that could accomplish this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once you have got your computronium, you can burn ridiculous amounts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation time to fit the optimal paradigm, and optimize it into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ridiculous dexterity, here you're only constrained by raw physics, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local physics looks so far extremely friendly to hackers.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Computronium&quot; is not likely to be an early product of nanotech IMO.
<br>
It seems to be a very advanced material.  To build mass quantities
<br>
of computronium you must have already solved all of the construction
<br>
problems, so it will not work as a design strategy to rely on this kind
<br>
of massive computation to solve the low level problems.  (OTOH it may be
<br>
possible to build sufficiently massive computers using bulk technology.)
