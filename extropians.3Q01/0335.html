<p>
&nbsp;I am endebted to Anders Sandberg for this idea.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The air we breathe consists of about 0.2 atmospheres
<br>
&nbsp;of oxygen and about 0.8 atmospheres nitrogen. Divers
<br>
&nbsp;have shown that helium can be substituted for the nitrogen,
<br>
&nbsp;since the body does not use either substance.  Helium
<br>
&nbsp;actually works better for high pressure applications, since it is
<br>
&nbsp;a noble gas, and so does not react with or dissolve in the
<br>
&nbsp;bloodstream like nitrogen will do under sufficient pressure.
<br>
&nbsp;In a diving bell, oxygen can be held at .2 atmospheres and
<br>
&nbsp;helium added with no apparent harm or discomfort to the
<br>
divers.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The noble gas xenon is chemically similar to helium,
<br>
&nbsp;except for being nearly 33 times denser.  If a person
<br>
&nbsp;were to be placed in a pressure chamber with oxygen held at
<br>
&nbsp;0.2 atmospheres, then xenon added until the total pressure came
<br>
&nbsp;up to about 190 atmospheres, the density of the gas mixture
<br>
&nbsp;in the chamber would be about equal to that of water.  The
<br>
&nbsp;person would then float.  It would simulate weightlessness
<br>
&nbsp;better than being in water, since the xenonaut could breathe the
<br>
&nbsp;medium in which she was floating.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The partial pressure of oxygen would need to be increased
<br>
&nbsp;somewhat to counteract the tendency of the oxygen to
<br>
&nbsp;float to the top, however there is no reason to doubt that
<br>
&nbsp;humans could swim in xenon.  The experience would not
<br>
&nbsp;be exactly the same as floating in your living room however,
<br>
&nbsp;for the pitch of the voice varies as the inverse square root
<br>
&nbsp;of the density of the medium. The xenon swimmer's voice
<br>
&nbsp;would be lowered by nearly 4 octaves, causing her to talk
<br>
&nbsp;like Lurch the butler.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It would take no extraordinary engineering of pressure vessels
<br>
&nbsp;to accommodate 190 atmospheres.  In fact even a relatively
<br>
&nbsp;thin walled container would do fine, if one could arrange to lower
<br>
&nbsp;it into the sea as the pressure is raised.  Alternately, the chamber
<br>
&nbsp;could be placed at the bottom of a mile-deep shaft and water could
<br>
&nbsp;be allowed to flow in as the pressure is raised, then drained
<br>
&nbsp;as the pressure is lowered.  Even if the pressure needed to be
<br>
&nbsp;dropped quickly, this should not present a problem, since it has
<br>
&nbsp;been pointed out that the solubility of xenon is negligible.  The worst
<br>
&nbsp;possible effect would be the expanding xenon would escape from
<br>
&nbsp;the bodily orifices into which it has been forced during the
<br>
&nbsp;pressurization, perhaps creating embarrassing noises.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The one killer app for weightlessness that eeeeveryone wants
<br>
&nbsp;to try might not work out either, since one likely could not
<br>
&nbsp;breathe fast enough.  The dense column of xenon would resist
<br>
&nbsp;changing direction quickly, so the participants could scarcely
<br>
&nbsp;get their breathing rate much above 1 Hz, insuffient for this
<br>
&nbsp;kind of activity.  Then there's the problem of sounding like
<br>
&nbsp;Jabba the Hut and Mrs. Hut on their honeymoon, which might
<br>
&nbsp;in itself spoil the mood.  Other than that, one could put together
<br>
&nbsp;a really cool sensory deprivation chamber.  spike
