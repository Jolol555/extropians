</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;My point was that before Unions came along everybody DID make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;minimum, and it was a much smaller minimum.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Actually, there wasnt a minimum wage back then, so Im not sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what minimum your referring to. The workers got paid based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supply and demand. The big problem was the over abundance of labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at the time. As the companies grew, this would have corrected
</em><br>
<em>&gt;itself.
</em><br>
<p>I should have put minimum in quotations, what I meant was they were
<br>
paid the very minimum the owners felt like paying. Since the
<br>
companies were monoposonys, they weren't paying a fair market or
<br>
&quot;supply and demand&quot; wage, they had control of the market and were
<br>
paying considerably less than a fair market wage.
<br>
<p>Supply and demand is affected by whether or not a market is fair.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Ill agree, but it would have happened in due time anyways. As the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;market grew, it would have created more jobs thereby again tilting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the supply/demand into the favor of the workers. Once again, would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have happened anyways.
</em><br>
<p>I've actually been considering how it might have occured if unions
<br>
hadn't started the ball rolling.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Im sure we would all like to think were worth a billion dollars an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hour, but thankfully the market dictates your salary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I also dont have a problem with workers refusing to work unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they have union workers beside them, but what I do object to is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;using government force on the side of the workers to force a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;company to deal with a union. 
</em><br>
<p>I'm not worth a billion, but worth considerably more than I'm paid.
<br>
Actually the company is getting a bonus these days. As a network
<br>
engineer I could probably earn a good deal more than the Union
<br>
scale I'm making, so sometimes it works both ways.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The company should in all rights, have the right to fire anyone it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wants and replace them at will.
</em><br>
<p>In a fair situation I would agree, but not if the situation is
<br>
unfair or arbitrary.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Let me be more specific then. Unskilled labor most certainly can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be moved offshore for most functions. Only where things need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;built on site are manual laborers needed here.
</em><br>
<p>It's not mere manual labor for those of us who remain, most of my
<br>
work is troubleshooting.
<br>
<p>Yes, much of this work is going to the cheapest labor markets
<br>
wherever they are.
<br>
<p>This creates new problems in the form of an unemployed citizens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Commendable, long as government force isnt given to either the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;company or the union sides.
</em><br>
<p>Actually as I posted before, the government often interferes on
<br>
what it sees as it's own behalf, effectively taking the side of the
<br>
company.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;They would have been &quot;enlightened&quot; a lot earlier if there had been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a labor shortage.
</em><br>
<p>Labor shortage is usually a very temporary thing, and now with
<br>
globalization it may be a thing of the past.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Like I was mentioning my before, my stock options I have are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pretty good. It was a major factor in me deciding to work where I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do. We get pretty good benefits otherwise and guess what, theres
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no union there at all.
</em><br>
<p>Benefits originally won by union members were quickly distributed
<br>
to nonmembers as well (to keep them from joining a Union!) this has
<br>
evolved to the system we have today. Unions provide a check and
<br>
balance for all workers.
<br>
<p>I'm delighted that a fellow list member is doing well, my own stock
<br>
portfolio has been taking a severe beating since last year. :(
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;There are a number of people including the government who say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that Microsoft engaged in practices that were illegal. I prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to wait till the courts finish with this.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Doesnt matter if and when they finish with it to me. Any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accusation of a coersive monopoly in the US is false by definition
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unless its made a monopoly by the government and afforded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protection by them. Then I have a problem with it.
</em><br>
<p>Well the legal definition may be different from yours.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This goes back to the benefits I am obtaining from my company
</em><br>
<em>&gt;above any particular &quot;minimums&quot;. They are in place because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;company knows that if they dont compete with other buisnesses, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will lose their workers.
</em><br>
<p>Or they might go Union? ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Actually, when I was 19 I was union steward in an electrical plant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that I worked at (yes, 19). It was only after a few years of study
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on various topics from history to economics that I saw the error
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of my ways and dropped them quick as a hot potato. My entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thrust here is that when the labor demand outgrows the supply,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;buisness will certainly have to provide goodies to keep their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;workers. This entire workers benefits thing would have happened
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyways by market forces in time and without anyone using
</em><br>
<em>&gt;governmental force and the market would have been responsible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all these nice extras we like and have.
</em><br>
<p>I was still a U.S Marine at 19. (aircraft electrician)
<br>
<p>I think we agree on the benefits of a free market, I think we just
<br>
disagreed on how they originated, or maybe better to say if such an
<br>
origin was necessary.
