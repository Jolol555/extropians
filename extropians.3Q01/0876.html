As a point of interest, there is an article in the July 6th 2001
<br>
issue of Science:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Humpherys, D. et al,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Epigenetic Instability in ES Cells and Cloned Mice&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;URL: <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/293/5527/95">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/293/5527/95</a>
<br>
<p>Abstract:
<br>
<em>&gt; Cloning by nuclear transfer (NT) is an inefficient process in which most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clones die before birth and survivors often display growth abnormalities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In an effort to correlate gene expression with survival and fetal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overgrowth, we have examined imprinted gene expression in both mice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cloned by nuclear transfer and in the embryonic stem (ES) cell donor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; populations from which they were derived. The epigenetic state of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ES cell genome was found to be extremely unstable. Similarly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variation in imprinted gene expression was observed in most cloned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mice, even in those derived from ES cells of the same subclone. Many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the animals survived to adulthood despite widespread gene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dysregulation, indicating that mammalian development may be rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tolerant to epigenetic aberrations of the genome.  These data imply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that even apparently normal cloned animals may have subtle abnormalities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in gene expression. 
</em><br>
<p>I believe that I've commented on this previously in postulating that
<br>
faulty imprinting of epigenetic information may be a possible cause
<br>
of the low efficiency of cloning.  This paper would appear to cast
<br>
some doubts on that -- in that you can get adults even with
<br>
&quot;widespread gene dysregulation&quot;.  Of course there may be
<br>
selection effects at work here, i.e. one set of dysregulated
<br>
genes results in an adult (with wierd spin on gene regulation)
<br>
while another set of dysregulated genes results in fetal termination.
<br>
So perhaps the jury is still out.
<br>
<p>The big picutre depends to a large degree on the fraction of genes
<br>
that carry parental &quot;imprinting&quot; and their significance in development
<br>
to fetal/adult maturity.  It may be true that modern medicine, including
<br>
C-sections for larger than average size babies, may mitigate the
<br>
value/importance of gene imprinting.  (The &quot;imprinted&quot; genes I
<br>
know of are involved in the male/female tradeoff in the male's
<br>
desire to foster large newborns vis-a-vis the female's desire
<br>
to manage resource consumption and maternal birth risk.)
<br>
<p>The bottom line re: cloning with current technology is that you
<br>
may not get what you expected.  Cloned organs may fail prematurely
<br>
and whole body clones may not provide a full lifespan.  Until the
<br>
full impact of epigenetic imprinting is understood, lobbying for
<br>
&quot;real&quot; availability of cloned organs or bodies seems premature.
<br>
Yes, they may be better than nothing, but they probably do not
<br>
carry the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) warranty.
