<em>&gt; &gt;This definition ,of capitalism&gt; is not very useful without definitions for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;decision&quot; and &quot;state control.&quot;  Clearly, this definition assumes that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;practice of capitalism is consistent within the jurisdiction of a political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;state, since the definition includes ownership of capital goods by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;corporations, which are creations of the state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly so, which is why I keep querying whether a pure libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political philosophy can allow for *corporate* capitalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Although the distinction between state and corporation is clear where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;corporation is very small (in terms of resources controlled) relative to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;state, the distinction becomes much less clear when corporations are as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;large or larger than the state under whose laws they're registered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;Minarchism&quot; might be a more useful term than &quot;capitalism,&quot; but I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that even minarchists would allow the existence of corporations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I'm not sure they all do. I can't verify this quickly, but I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'll find that Mike Lorrey is not the only libertarian thinker who reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that corporations can't be allowed coz there is no justification for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state to have the power to bequeath corporate privileges on trading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associations (Mike: I *assume* that is what you were saying is essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your position; correct me if I've misread you).
</em><br>
<p>Generally, though I don't wish to 'ban' anything in a libertarian world.
<br>
Any company may seek to purchase such liability protection from its
<br>
insurance provider. The obvious costs of such protection would likely
<br>
price the premiums rather high, especially with products of dubious
<br>
risk, and obviously, insurance based liability protections would likely
<br>
have much more fair means to get at the company's assets, with codocils
<br>
in the insurance contracts that refuse to cover instances of fraud,
<br>
deception, etc...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It would probably be useful to examine the various characteristics of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;corporations (perpetual existence, limited liability, management separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;from ownership, etc.) to see which of these tend to undermine truly free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;markets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I'm not sure what it means to say that they &quot;undermine free markets&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They have the effect though, that the market becomes one involving these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legally fictionally entities as players, and this has various disadvantages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, it also has the advantage of facilitating large accumulations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private wealth, which (admittedly) has disadvantages of its own but seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be good for economic growth and technological progress. I say &quot;seems&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I've not come across any literature that tries to analyse the likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic and technological effects of forcing trading associations to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operate essentially as partnerships, with individuals having liability for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debts etc - ie associations with none of the characteristics of corporations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you mentioned. I'd be interested if anyone on the list knows something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about this.
</em><br>
<p>Its the unacknowledged part of 'to each according to his needs'. Someone
<br>
who has proven exceptional skills at managing capital should be given
<br>
control of that capital. Furthermore, I have yet to see anyone, still,
<br>
contest my assertions about the individual's right to the product of
<br>
their labor being the basis of capital accumulation, and that
<br>
confiscation of saved labor by the state is slavery.
