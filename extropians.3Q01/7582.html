<em>&gt; Alright, it's probably not feasible and it might be considered an act of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force (?) but to my mind this meets the main criteria I have for any of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these operations: speed.  If we could quickly establish a compliant,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The fun part with this unethical and dangerous &quot;solution&quot; is of course
<br>
when some friendly person drops them in the US water supply too - after
<br>
all, isn't the US in dire need of becoming a more compliant and
<br>
dependent society? The suggestible part might be fixed already. 
<br>
<p>Seriously, I can't see what makes this &quot;solution&quot; extropian. It is not
<br>
based on any consideration of the rights of other people or their
<br>
self-direction, trust in open societies (last I checked, mind control
<br>
did not produce democracy, but maybe the Ministry of Truth has changed
<br>
that in the meantime) or rational thinking (it clouds rational thinking
<br>
together with badthink). It just involves high tech. 
<br>
<p>OK, I guess it was a joke anyway and I should lighten up (I'm suffering 
<br>
from DAIS - Deadline and Autumn Induced Seriousness). But I am
<br>
getting worried about the dearth of really extropian material on the
<br>
list. How many have actually read and pondered the Principles?
