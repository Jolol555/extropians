<p><em>&gt; Getting a place in the history books isn't a good reason to do

</em><br>
<p>Of course.  But it would seem almost unbelievably difficult for
<br>
anyone to get truly beyond that need.  My own best theory as to
<br>
why a number of famous people who admit that cryonics would work,
<br>
e.g. Issac Asimov, never bothered to get themselves frozen, is
<br>
that they had begun to live for their fame.  I am seriously 
<br>
doubtful of denials of the appeal of fame and fortune; to some
<br>
degree they remind me of the calls to altruism made by failed
<br>
economic systems.  Perhaps it's only deeply unconsciously, but
<br>
I don't think that there is anyone who can stand up and claim
<br>
that no *comparitively mundane* aren't also a factor in the
<br>
working of his or her mind.  We just have to learn to live with
<br>
this, and, indeed make the best use of it.
<br>
<p>I never feel any the worse about someone when I come to have
<br>
reason to think that either fame or fortune is a factor in their
<br>
behavior.  The only thing that annoys me is when they're so
<br>
transparent about it that it comes accross as petty and blind,
<br>
and seems to bespeak an inability to see the situation from 
<br>
others' points of view.
