<p>Ayn, as you might recall, was Russian as well, and escaped during the
<br>
Russian Revolution. I don't know exactly why, but it seems to me that
<br>
the classic Russian paranoia and xenophobia, which I think originated in
<br>
the mongol oppression, is a significant problem for a person to overcome
<br>
for them to properly assimilate into the high trust anglosphere society.
<br>
<p>Of course, I don't think that Ayn was the be all and end all of
<br>
libertarian thought. I think that she's a bit pedantic and demonstrates
<br>
a classically Russian demagogery in her prosecution of Objectivist
<br>
thought.
