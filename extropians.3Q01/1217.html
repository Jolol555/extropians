<em>&gt;     &gt; Why the focus on a land invasion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't believe I did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Defensive technology was doing fine until about 1918
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Castles and forts stopped being important long before then.
</em><br>
<p>Incorrect. Traditional stone walled square keep designs became outmoded.
<br>
Since that time, the star shaped fortresses of rock faced earth berms
<br>
with overlapping fields of fire became of paramount importance in
<br>
securing land and river routes against invasion forces, primarily as
<br>
defense systems to protect artillery units used to support scouts and
<br>
forward observers. Many of the primary battles of the Revolutionary and
<br>
Civil Wars were fought at such sites, such as Forts McHenry, Sumter,
<br>
Ticonderoga, William and Mary, among others.
<br>
<p>Forts didn't become outmoded until the rise of air power as a means of
<br>
trumping the artillery power of fortresses.
<br>
<p>This evolution is one continuously toward attaining the higher ground
<br>
from which to project force. Forts at hilltops and choke points
<br>
commanded the heights over valleys and rivers through which troops and
<br>
artillery could be marched or sailed (and in artillery duels, he who is
<br>
higher, wins). Then aircraft commanded the heights over fortresses, and
<br>
war became one of maneuver, feint, and surprise lighting strikes, of
<br>
scouting out and locking down enemy forces in order to bring in standoff
<br>
fire support from either artillery or aircraft. Then ballistic missiles
<br>
gained greater advantage over aircraft: they could carry more ordinance
<br>
farther, cheaper, and faster than aircraft. The ultimate higher ground
<br>
is in orbit, intercepting ballistic missiles, at which point, warfare
<br>
becomes purely an economic enterprise, it is no longer about killing
<br>
people. When war becomes a matter of machine killing machine, it is an
<br>
economic enterprise, and decisions of when to start and stop fighting
<br>
are made purely on an economic basis. Nationalism and the arrogance of
<br>
leaders will no longer be a function, leading to a safer world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;If, e.g., Iraq or Serbia had the US level of  technological and military
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;development would the recent wars with them have turned out the same?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course not, and we would have been fools to start a war with such a country.
</em><br>
<p>Bull. The most key statement about war is &quot;amateurs talk tactics,
<br>
dilletantes talk strategy, professionals talk logistics.&quot; It doesn't
<br>
matter if Iraq had the same level of military technology and quantities,
<br>
because it would have bought it all with their oil money. They have no
<br>
domestic military industry of any amount, nor do they have any sort of
<br>
materiel resources in strategic metals, or a transportation system to
<br>
move such materials, to supply such an industry, and it is industry and
<br>
resources that matter most in war. It is why we beat the Japanese and
<br>
the Germans, despite them being better prepared and more technologically
<br>
advanced. Japan could not survive without oil from other countries, it
<br>
has none of its own. It also lacks metals and lumber. Germany was in
<br>
better shape, but still could not compare to either the US or the USSR
<br>
in total resources or industrial capacity. Either one of us alone could
<br>
have beaten Germany, it just would have taken a little longer, at most
<br>
another 3-5 years.
<br>
<p>Germany's problem was they only counted quantities in their stockpiles
<br>
when doing strategic assessments, they did not count production rates or
<br>
potential production rates, or even material supply rates. Any rational
<br>
assessment of this would have told them it was suicidal to fight a war
<br>
with any one of the three allies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; Let's talk about a more realistic example.  Suppose Norh Korea were to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; launch three or four nuclear armed missles at the US's West Coast, say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; targetting Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle.  Stopping one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; of those missles would save one city from any immediate damage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the cold war people said we don't have to worry about a suitcase H bomb from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russia because the Russians haven't invented the suitcase yet. It was a joke, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so are the reasons I've heard to justify Star Wars. If North Korea wanted to kill us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they had The Bomb why on earth would they send it to us with a ICBM and not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UPS? An ICBM is expensive, harder to make than The Bomb and everybody knows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where it was launched from. UPS is cheap, easy, and nobody will know where it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; came from, all they'll know is that Seattle no longer exists.
</em><br>
<p>Why is it that Seattle is always the most popular place in people's
<br>
scenarios to nuke with a backpack terrorist weapon? I'd much prefer it
<br>
if Washington DC or New York City got waxed, and I'll bet that most
<br>
terrorists would feel the same way.
<br>
<p>The reason that it is useless is the same reason that both major power
<br>
call backpack weapons 'tactical nukes': they serve no strategic utility
<br>
as a weapon against population centers. All they would do is piss off a
<br>
lot more people than they killed, and wind up with the US laying waste,
<br>
with the cooperation of normally pacifistic people like the Japanese and
<br>
everyone else in between, of those responsible for such an attack. Any
<br>
group that claims responsibility for such an attack is writing its own
<br>
death warrant, and they know this.
<br>
<p>Tactical nukes are only useful in the event that conventional war by an
<br>
overwhelming foe is started (like the USSR invading Europe, or China
<br>
invading, say, Taiwan). You use your tactical nukes at key choke points:
<br>
there are about a dozen places in Germany where you could eliminate all
<br>
east-west traffic corridors by highway, rail, and river by just wasting
<br>
those locations with pony nukes. This is why the US kept pony nukes in
<br>
safe locations in Germany in the first place, and also why short to
<br>
medium range missiles like the Pershing and Pershing 2 were deployed
<br>
there: to create additional delay by targeting similar crux points in
<br>
eastern europe.
<br>
<p>Similarly, I'll bet that Taiwan has obtained several of the missing
<br>
Soviet backpack nukes, and has plans to use them on Chinese naval ports
<br>
and riverways if China launches an invasion. They might also use them
<br>
against any beach head that Chinese forces establish on Taiwan. This is
<br>
an ideal application for such weapons.
