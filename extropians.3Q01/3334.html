<p><em>&gt; Spike, your experiences with other lists seem to fit mine too. ...Spike, how

</em><br>
<p>Anders this question is complicated by the fact that extropians is
<br>
actually a collection of lists, or a broad collection of topics.  Two
<br>
of my regular lists have to do with mathematics.  There is no
<br>
real point in debating issues that can be reduced to equations.
<br>
If any topic there cannot be expressed as an equation, it doesnt
<br>
belong there and doesnt get answered.  List culture there is
<br>
straight to the point.  We on the Mersenne Prime list have a party
<br>
whenever a new record prime is discovered.  When the 38th
<br>
Mersenne prime was found in June 99 we had a big hootnanny
<br>
at one of the local restaurants, and afterwards we were posting
<br>
gags about ordering the *prime* rib, etc, and pretty soon a
<br>
wicked pun fest broke out, and I was (blush) one of the worst
<br>
offenders.  They tolerated it for a few days, then they politely
<br>
asked us to please knock it off.  So we did.  On extropians,
<br>
when such silliness occurred, the folks seemed much more
<br>
tolerant of that sorta thing.  I dont know how that observation
<br>
fits with your theory Anders.  Extropians list culture is more
<br>
open?
<br>
<p>British motorcycle list: almost zero tolerance of anything that
<br>
doesnt have something to do directly with BSA motorcycles.
<br>
Many repeatedly called for mercy during the two months that
<br>
most of the posts were about privacy and traffic cams.  Some
<br>
on that list claimed that they were poor readers, and could not
<br>
keep up if we were going to chatter.  This explanation was
<br>
quite believable, if you were to see some of the things people
<br>
there posted.  I finally dropped that list, for reading it was a
<br>
painful experience.
<br>
<p>Wearhard: very similar to extropians in many ways, more
<br>
focussed but same kind of guys: nerds all.  I dont recall that
<br>
list ever discussing anything more controversial than which
<br>
head mounted displays are superior.  Kind of a boring list,
<br>
to be honest.
<br>
<p>Mars colonization list: very focussed, fairly intolerant of
<br>
of topic posts, which is to be expected.
<br>
<p>The astronomy list is filled with people like Amara,
<br>
so vitriol is seldom seen there.  I finally gave that
<br>
one up because I use my email primarily as a source
<br>
of entertainment, and many of the posts were quite
<br>
involved.
<br>
<p>I lurked on a list for people with growth disorders for a
<br>
while in order to find out what is the lower limit to the
<br>
size of humans, this to design a Mars mission.  Quite a
<br>
disappointing experience, for the average level of
<br>
conversation there was way lower than any other list
<br>
I have ever seen, about what I would expect from a
<br>
list for teenagers, altho I have never actually read
<br>
a teen list.  I found no one there I would want to turn
<br>
loose with a jillion dollar spacecraft.  There was
<br>
no apparent focus at all.  I never did figure out who
<br>
was the Greg Burch of that crowd, in order to make
<br>
contact and have him find out the dimensions the
<br>
smallest of the small and how many grams of food
<br>
a day they devour, etc.  {I eventually got the information
<br>
thru indirect contact with Verne Troyer, the diminutive
<br>
actor who played Mini Me in Austin Powers.  Long story.}
<br>
<p>The chess list had world war 3 over one seemingly
<br>
innocent post pointing out that the world had its first
<br>
black grandmaster.  Im not sure why so many found
<br>
that so offensive.  Several guys posted stuff like, HEY
<br>
whaddya mean FIRST black grandmaster?  IM a
<br>
grandmaster, and my great grandmother was a well-
<br>
known sport, bedded every young stud in town, and
<br>
two of her children... yakkity yak and bla bla.  It
<br>
devolved quickly, as you might imagine.
<br>
<p>Now that I write out these descriptions, I see why
<br>
I spend more time and effort on extropians than all
<br>
the other lists combined.
<br>
<p>My original point is that the same topics that trip
<br>
extropians cause trouble elsewhere too: racism,
<br>
sexism, privacy vs openness, gun control, etc.  These
<br>
things can be effectively discussed, as long as they are
<br>
handled with care, and everyone examines their own
<br>
preconceived notions on the topic.  So far we have
<br>
generated more heat than light, eh?
<br>
<p>If you have access to Murray and Herrnstein's The
<br>
Bell Curve, do read their introduction, where they
<br>
acknowledge that differences in race is a terribly
<br>
difficult topic to study or even discuss.  They lay out
<br>
their approach, to be as honest, open minded, fair
<br>
and logical as is humanly possible.  Whether or not
<br>
we agree with their conclusions, Murray and Herrnstein
<br>
are worth the time to read methinks, as are their
<br>
many opponents.
<br>
<p>Anders I dont know if I was anywhere near your
<br>
question with all this.  {8-]  spike
