<em>&gt; &gt; Molloy and Lorrey didn't discuss racism. And it really has little to do

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problem of racial inequality, noting that many of the poorest segments of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society are predominantly black, then yes it would have been something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people would have felt uncomfortable about, but discussion may have been a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; heck of a lot more profitable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In what way would people have felt threatened by a discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about how to &quot;solve&quot; the problem of racial inequality.  Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you mean that some would be uncomfortable at the thought of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using government to do it?  Yes, I think you are right about that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That wasn't the point.  It was only brought up as an
<br>
illustration of what the original discussion wasn't about re the
<br>
level people's response might be due to discomfort and reaction
<br>
to subjects about race. It was brought up in order to dismiss
<br>
that as a significant factor in some people seeing some of the
<br>
remarks as rascist.  I think it is a fair point.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I note your use of their last names.  Do I infer correctly that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you agreed with them, you would refer to them differently?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If so, do you approve of the general principle of referring to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people differently based upon whether we agree with them or not?
</em><br>
<p>I think you are really grasping at straws here Lee. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But some of the puke that Lorrey and Molloy came up with did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not amount to discussion and it is no wonder it was pounced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; upon by many here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Puke?  Can you honestly defend the use of such language?  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know, you are supporting the contention that many liberals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or whatever they're called where you come from) really are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less capable of being fair and objective in discussion.  (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have not seen enough evidence of that, but you are adding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to what evidence there is.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In this case I agree with the poster.  Some of the remarks were
<br>
quite tasteless.  Ignoring that point to counter-attack does not
<br>
seem helpful at all.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm sorry, but I don't entirely believe that you plonked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them because of the frequency of their posts, and the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they had nothing &quot;worthwhile&quot; to say.  You can refute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me by saying how many other people you have plonked, oh,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say in the last year---*who were not ideological adversaries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of yours*!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But the poster has absolutely no need to refute your
<br>
presumptions about whether the reasons given are the actual
<br>
reasons or not.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Second, what that person said  &quot;I'm not racist. I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; help that blacks are stupid.&quot; is *not* necessarily absurd,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; as you claim.  It may be entirely wrong; it may be a gross
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; over-generalization; it may be so utterly an unqualified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; assertion that it absolutely demands refutation---but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; not absurd.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Oh, come on Lee. You don't seriously think that, surely. :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Of *course* it is absurd. The first statement, that he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not racist, is clearly contradicted by the second, a racist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; statement if ever there was one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Um, yes, I do.  It is possible that he isn't a racist, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is extremely careless in qualifying his statements.  See my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other criticisms of his statement above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't like to simply label people myself but the above
<br>
statement is absurd in that it is contradictory.  You can not
<br>
make such a sweeping generalization about an entire race
<br>
relative to others without uttering a rascist remark. So the
<br>
person may or may not *be* rascist but they definitely hold
<br>
rascist opinions and obviously rascist remarks.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Jerry Mitchell doesn't make a lot of sense if you ask me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The words sound noble, that we face up to contrary opinions, but practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; considerations intrude. Endlessly debating racism as a potentially valid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; viewpoint every time it reared its ugly head might be OK if we were already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immortal, but who has the time? You only need to show it is a mistake once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then move on. Avoid wrestling with a pig -- the pig enjoys it and you get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; covered in mud.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It sounds to me as if you underestimate the deepness of ideological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagreements.  You cannot expect to &quot;show some view is a mistake&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only once, as if it were an exercise in algebra.  Here, you also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equate some people, by metaphor, to pigs---I am certain that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't really mean that.  But the carelessness of your remarks (e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;pig&quot; and &quot;puke&quot;) show that you have little worry about negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotions affecting your rational decisions and statements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree the remarks are careless and I find some of your
<br>
arguments strike me as bordering on dishonest sophistry.
