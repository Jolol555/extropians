<em>&gt;From: &quot;Olga Bourlin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:fauxever@sprynet.com?Subject=Re:%20Discrimination%20(was:%20White%20Male%20Discrimination)&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108071947.MAA13144@well.com&gt;">fauxever@sprynet.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;I know what the issues are and how they are different.  I did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mention anything about reparations.  I was talking about bigotry,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and how it neither ended with slavery nor magically go away &quot;7
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generations&quot; ago.
</em><br>
<p>You keep infering that we of the present are responsible for the
<br>
deeds of the past, that we owe some debt.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; What about voluntary segregation?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;It's your right to hang around with anyone you want.  But public
</em><br>
<em>&gt;schools should not bar children of a certain color from attending. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And hospitals shouldn't have a policy of barring people of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certain color from receiving treatment.  And public pools should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not be for &quot;whites only.&quot;  Etcetera.
</em><br>
<p>Happens to be the law here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Hey, I've read Warren Farrell, myself.  
</em><br>
<p>I have no idea who this is, bad assumption.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Certain biases against men, women, ugly people, short people, fat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people, poor people (and on and on and on) exist, and those are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all different subjects in their own right (but cannot BEGIN to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;touch the subject of &quot;white on black&quot; racism that has existed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our country).  
</em><br>
<p><p>No, they are not all different subjects, they are the same subject,
<br>
and if you want to put an end to it you have to take it all into
<br>
consideration, not pick and choose your favorite.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;As to the &quot;any white male can tell you&quot; - all right, let's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;start with the white alpha male currently residing in the White
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(no pun intended) House - can he tell me the terrible trials and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tribulations he's gone through on his road to recove...eh, I mean,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on his road to the White House?  I wonder.  Wouldn't he qualify as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an &quot;any&quot; male?  Any white male, you say, huh?  (Get serious!)
</em><br>
<p>I don't know if the president has actually faced any discrimination
<br>
for being a white male or any other kind, other than being a
<br>
republician, and of course your cheap shot at his former
<br>
overindulgence in alcohol.
