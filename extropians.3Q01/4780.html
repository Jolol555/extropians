<p>This is an important point for extropians.  We tend to think any future
<br>
development that takes more than about 50 yrs as irrelevant, which it
<br>
most likely is.  We tend toward an apocalyptic view of the future, since
<br>
a singularity will most likely occur sometime in the next half century.
<br>
Even I agree with that, and I tend to be conservative in my estimates
<br>
of when the singularity will come.  The attitude is eerily reminiscent of
<br>
one I know well from my misspent youth: that of the second-coming-ists,
<br>
the jesus-is-coming-soon crowd.  They and we tend to be unconcerned
<br>
about environmental issues, for instance, because those impacts are
<br>
unlikely to be significant before the apocalypse/singularity.
<br>
<p>Military thinkers, on the other hand, are the closest you will find to
<br>
professional long-range prognosticators.  Reason: it takes a loooong
<br>
time to develop a new military system.  You may have read that
<br>
congress gave the OK for low-rate initial production of the F22
<br>
fighter last week.  The F22 fighter is 20 years old this month.  The
<br>
design phase was kicked off in the early months of the Reagan
<br>
administration.  15 years is a typical design cycle for a major
<br>
system.  So the generals always need to be thinking 20 to 30
<br>
years out, a period beyond which most of us would argue is
<br>
impossible to predict, since it is post singularity.  Missile defense
<br>
is already nearly 40 years old, and may take another 40.
<br>
<p>The future takes a long time to happen, unless the singularity
<br>
comes along.  But there might be some unknown reason why
<br>
the singularity will not happen.  I do not know what it is, but
<br>
there might be one.  In the mean time, I suspect it would be
<br>
quite dangerous to stop developing newer and better weapons.
<br>
History shows that when any nation does that, some other
<br>
nation comes along and wipes them out.  So I consider myself
<br>
a techno-dove, one who seeks peace by developing better
<br>
and better weapons.  spike
