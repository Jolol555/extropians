|Why is that hard to believe?  Many extropians have
<br>
|legally changed their names... 
<br>
|
<br>
|I wasn't born Loree Thomas.
<br>
<p>If person X Y. Z wanted to change its name to something else
<br>
in the U.S. of A., how hard is it?
<br>
<p>In Sweden, it costs just to apply for name change, which the government
<br>
might, or might not, approve. You can only change your surname once, and
<br>
if you get your surname by marrying a person who have changed its surname,
<br>
you cannot give it away if you divorce. You may add, modify, or remove
<br>
first names at will, except first names may not clash with known trade
<br>
marks, surnames, etc. New surnames must not be used by anybody else, or
<br>
they need to give their consent to you using it. [short decsription]
<br>
<p>Anyways, the government decides whether it likes your new name or nor.
<br>
<p>So if I wanted to change my name to Sandberg, I would have to all the
<br>
zillions of Sandberg's in Sweden for consent in writing before applying.
<br>
<p>Names like Zero Powers would not be valid, as they do not follow the
<br>
local customary name forms. Loree Thomas would probably fall on the
<br>
fact that &quot;Thomas&quot; is a first name, _unless_ you can prove that some of
<br>
your parents/ancestors used it as a surname.
