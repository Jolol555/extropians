And now to respond to Peter's particular points.

</em><br>
<p>I think you're mostly right about that, though I suspect that under
<br>
reasonable assumptions nuclear wouldn't have made much difference.  If
<br>
we're only talking about a few nuclear plants, it would have moved the
<br>
demand curve down to a different marginal producer (with lower cost
<br>
structure, as you argue), but it appears that the market could still
<br>
have been pushed to use producers who had to pay the LA NOx emissions
<br>
charges.  But another part of their argument holds here, too.  With
<br>
prices as they were in the mid-90s there wasn't any reason for anyone to
<br>
build nuclear, especially with the huge costs they face in regulatory
<br>
costs, and the many thickets of NIMBYism they'd have to face.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  They argue that in an otherwise free market, the restrictions on long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contracts wouldn't have affected prices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  They have a reasonable claim that it ought not to have affected retail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices, but given the actual political climate it seems likely that consumers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or taxpayers will actually end up paying something that approximates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average prices that the utilities faced.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but their more important point was that if consumers don't see
<br>
actual price variability, they have no incentive to cut down on their
<br>
usage.  It's the insensitivity of demand to price that allowed prices to
<br>
skyrocket once there was a constriction in the supply.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  They also claim that producers who signed long-term contracts at low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices would go bankrupt and renege on their contracts, as some who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually signed such contracts have done.  The claim that a significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fraction would go bankrupt seems to reflect an unusual pessimism about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reasonableness of the relevant bankruptcy laws, 
</em><br>
<p>How so?  They said it happened before in the 80s.  I don't know the
<br>
history, myself.  What do you think bankruptcy laws could do?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and/or an unusual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lack of confidence in the ability of producers to hedge their risks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm fairly confident that many producers would or did sign long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contracts with natural gas producers, and that those natural gas producers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have wells operating at predictable enough costs to fulfill those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contracts. My impression is that some of the actual breach of long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contracts to which the paper seems to be refering started when the utilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broke the contracts by failing to pay, which would at least have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postponed a long time if the utilities had had more such contracts.
</em><br>
<p>The only way I can make sense of their discussion of first price auction
<br>
rules is to assume that the long-term contracts are treated as
<br>
equivalent to a promise to bid the contracted price in the Power
<br>
Exchange market.  When prices rise as they have, this would mean that
<br>
even the long-term suppliers would recieve the clearing price.  If this
<br>
rule isn't followed, it undercuts their whole argument about uniform
<br>
prices on the spot market.
<br>
<p>But I admit I don't know.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  They seem to imply that that long-term contracts would not have affected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the blackouts, but it sure looks to me like, given the mistaken retail price
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caps, the rate at which the utilities lost money would have been drastically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduced, possibly by enough to keep them solvent until the shortage ends.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If they had been solvent enough to pay the QFs most of what they were owed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fewer of those QFs would have shut down due to lack of cash, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available QF generating capacity would have been larger. I suspect this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have averted most of the blackouts.
</em><br>
<p>If the long-term contracts are paid at the price bid, then your argument
<br>
is sound.  It seems that in that case, the crisis would have been
<br>
reduced, which given it's self-magnifying nature, could easily have made
<br>
the whole thing a non-issue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  But at least their analysis is better than the airline ticket analogy, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggests that spot prices will normally be much higher than long-term contract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices (that kind of price discrimination happens in airline ticketing because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the last-minute business traveller is less price sensitive than early ticket
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buyers).
</em><br>
<p>It seems plausible, given the current institutions, that the last minute
<br>
power buyer is less price sensitive.  At least currently, when the last
<br>
buyer is buying emergency back-up capacity.  If the market were
<br>
rational, then you'd be right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Their claim that a &quot;three-year dry spell&quot; &quot;reduced hydro-electric generation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in California&quot; is misleading. California has had three years of increasingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dry weather, but 2001 was the first of those years to actually be drier than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the historical average. Maybe if they had been talking about the west as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a whole rather than California the claim would be right.
</em><br>
<p>Early in the paper, they were clear that 98 and 99 were fairly normal. 
<br>
I interpreted the later references to three years of drought to be
<br>
relative to the heavy rain years before.  Normal weather in California
<br>
is pretty dry, and not enough to refill all the reservoirs.  The normal
<br>
rainfall in 98 and 99 led to less-full reservoirs, and no cushion when
<br>
the rainfall was even lower in 2000.
<br>
<p>I think we're arguing about minor issues.  Do you think other policy
<br>
decisions than the price caps were foreseeable, or had a major impact on
<br>
the actual shape of the crisis?
