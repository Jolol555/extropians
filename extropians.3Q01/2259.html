<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; My fear is that any system that destroys groups for incorrect

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That doesn't sound like much to be afraid of. A system that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; destroys groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for incorrect thinking (in the extremely unlikely event that such a system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ever emerges) would have my full support. In fact, I'd form a group around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such a system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But who decides what is correct thinking?  The Democrats?  The Republicans?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Vatican?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you want President Bush's advisors to decide if stem cell research is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct thinking?  Do you want a team of top doctors to decide if cryonics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is feasible?  Do you want a consortium of Microsoft, Adobe, Cisco and IBM to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide if friendly AI is feasible?  Do you want the FDA to decide which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drugs are feasible?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think people on this list forget what a minority the cutting edge can be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any panel for correct thinking will quickly degenerate into political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correctness around the lowest common denominator.  Don't expect the masses
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Just so, and good points Harvey. The number one reason why Extropy even
<br>
exists is because most people support to one degree or another the idea
<br>
that freedom means having the right to be as silly as you please. Much
<br>
of what we discuss, theorize, and believe is seen as everything from
<br>
slightly outlandish to hilariously silly and farfetched by a large chunk
<br>
of society, and typically by a chunk of society that believes things we
<br>
think are similarly ludicrous.
<br>
<p>Its bad enough that this week a fellow was convicted here in the US for
<br>
simply keeping a private diary of pedophilic thoughts. I fully expect if
<br>
cryonics ever takes off significantly that environmentalists will sue to
<br>
shut it down on the basis that it wastes resources on the dead that
<br>
could be used for the living, and the greens will sue those that write
<br>
in favor of such technologies of advocating the criminal waste of scarce
<br>
resources.
<br>
<p>I consider myself to be a rather strident civil rights advocate,
<br>
although arguably one with a rather narrow focus on self defense rights,
<br>
but I believe its an area that has seen the worst sort of attacks by all
<br>
sorts of methods longer than just about any other area of civil rights
<br>
law, concurrently with little public outrage over such behavior, and I
<br>
am steadfastly against using those sorts of methods myself against
<br>
others.
