William, 
<br>
<p>Do you ever read Edward de Bono?  Your writing style reminds me a lot
<br>
of his.  If I didn't know better, I'd swear I *had* read this sentence
<br>
[from a separate post of yours], or one quite similar to it, in one of
<br>
his books:
<br>
<p>&quot;Water is always true to it's nature but it conforms to containers, rocks,
<br>
etc.&quot;
<br>
<p>No offense intended.  I really liked your post, &quot;Sleepers, a possible
<br>
solution&quot;.  
<br>
<p>In response to some comments on that essay, you wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
Yes, I think this is indeed what many people do instinctually.
<br>
I like to think that I am trying to nudge them one of the ways
<br>
they naturally tend to go and perhaps by description enable
<br>
them to do it better.
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>I don't agree that many people do it instinctually.  I think people's
<br>
instincts propel them to mainly associate with others who are like themselves.
<br>
&nbsp;I think there *is* an instinctual curiosity about people who are different
<br>
than we are, but it propels us to gawk and point, not invite them over
<br>
for dinner and generally make meaningful gestures toward bonding with
<br>
them.  
<br>
<p>That is why it's so important to spread powerful, positive memes like
<br>
yours, to help people *overcome* their instincts and reach out to those
<br>
who are different from them.  Indeed, the idea of overcoming our natural
<br>
instincts is central to extropianism, IMO.
<br>
<p>I definitely foresee your post spreading like wildfire around the net,
<br>
and would love to see it turn up in a magazine somewhere. It's a great
<br>
piece of work; I would encourage you to go ahead and submit it to some
<br>
magazines.  
<br>
<p>Don't be shy about sharing your ideas with the world.  In doing so, you
<br>
can help change the world for the better.  Go for it!
<br>
<p>Kindest regards,
<br>
<p>Bill Douglass
