</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; it happened in America.  Most of the impact, crashing global stock markets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so on, consists of people reacting to the terrorism.  A nuclear weapon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroying New York, on the other hand, would be a significant disaster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of how people reacted to it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If we don't act now - clearly, cleanly and decisively - to lance
<br>
the boil of antiamericanism and undeclared war against us and
<br>
all things secular and progress-oriented, then we will see
<br>
nuclear and/or bio-weapon attacks on this country.  We will have
<br>
sent a message of weakness and vulnerability.  We will have a
<br>
global &quot;Kick Me&quot; sign on us.

<em>&gt; I think, when I heard the news, that I pretty much guessed in advance how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rest of the day would go.  I knew that I'd hear a lot of people saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that things would never be the same again; a lot of grandstanding from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politicians talking about hitting back; the absence of any clear target
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for said revenge; proposals for useless domestic security measures whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sole real effect is giving people the feeling that they're &quot;doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something about it&quot;; attempts to blame the intelligence community for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failing to stop something that I for one never *expected* them to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to stop, no matter how competent they were... and so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Funny.  I heard a lot of people speaking for once from their
<br>
heart and head and saying what they really thought and felt for
<br>
a change. I saw a lot of newspeople actually do news, real news,
<br>
pretty well in a long time.  I saw a lot of this country gell
<br>
more than it has been for a while.  We will hit back and must
<br>
hit back.  Anything less would be suicidal. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think the only major surprise that day was when I heard a Congressman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say on CNN:  &quot;We have forgotten that the first priority of the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not education and it is not health care, it is the security of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens&quot;.  Apparently someone was angry enough to actually say something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent without thinking about the opinion polls.  I was also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprised to learn that all flights had been grounded and that the stock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market would be shut down for two full days, then surprised again today to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn the stock market would be shut down for three days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Why are you surprised? Flights were grounded in case more
<br>
flights were to be compromised and in order to beef up airport
<br>
security and probably to enhance some aspects of the
<br>
investigation.  The stock market was closed because hell was
<br>
blown out of some of the financial houses and a pretty good
<br>
chunk of New Your infrastructure the New Your exchange depends
<br>
on was wrecked.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; My reaction, on the whole, is that people are trying to forcibly make this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into one of the most significant events in world history.  I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is.  Not intrinsically.  I understand the impulse to magnify the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importance.  One doesn't want several thousand people to have died for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that doesn't ultimately change the course of history.  But I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think we'll see similar events in the future, and I don't think those will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change the course of history either.  It's just a lot of unnecessary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointless deaths.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is significant in that a lot of peopel are awake.  What we do
<br>
as a result is quite significant for better or worse.  It is not
<br>
just a bunch of deaths.  It is rogue nations reaching out and
<br>
attacking us on our own soil and hiding behind the assumption
<br>
that we are too &quot;civilized&quot; and too &quot;soft&quot; to do anything about
<br>
it.  We can either tell them they have us pegged correctly or
<br>
not.  Whichever we do will have quite a few repurcussions on
<br>
what comes next.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If the US does do anything real, militarily, it will probably involve more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death and destruction than was caused by the destruction of the World
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trade Center, dozens or hundreds of bombs instead of two planes, dropped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on some dirt-poor country far less capable of dealing with the disasters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resulting from each and every bomb impact, and the only real end result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be more hatred of the United States.  I don't expect that will stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the United States from doing it anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Are you saying we should not respond to an act of war as such? 
<br>
How exactly would this make future terrorism using suitcase or
<br>
larger nukes or a bioweapon less likely than if we took out as
<br>
many major terrorist cells as we can find?
