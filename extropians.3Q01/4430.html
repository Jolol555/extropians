<p><em>&gt;&gt; It stands to reason that if either you or Eugene could accomplish this,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Could you provide a general outline of what you'd do, exactly, to

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't say it would stay on track.  I said it'd wake up.  Friendliness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is *not* part of the spec on this one.
</em><br>
<p>How could you be so certain that by &quot;on track&quot; I was referring to 
<br>
friendliness??   I certainly was not.  By &quot;on track&quot;, I was actually
<br>
referring to the difficulty of its processes remaining coherant.  Is
<br>
this a part of a general pattern of instantly disagreeing with a post
<br>
as a preface for further remarks, I wonder.  It is *one* way, I suppose
<br>
of establishing an authoritative tone.  I was just asking a question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Leaving both morality and Friendliness aside,
</em><br>
<p>good!  They're irrelevant here
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and considering it purely from a technical standpoint, all that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really be needed is a partitioning into million-brainpower computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partitions, a genetic code that fills up those partitions with neural-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; network elements, and an arbitrarily complex competitive game in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moves are signalled by the outputs of those elements...   Take an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idiot-simple neural network the size of a planet as the starting point,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutate and recombine the genetic code randomly, and start playing with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trillion-sized population of megabrainpower entities (megabrainpower does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *not* imply megamindpower, it refers to the number of computing elements)...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd expect at least one superintelligence to be born before a million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generations had passed - five thousand seconds, less than two hours.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps.  This, together with your original remark that &quot;If the
<br>
Moon were made of computronium... [it might wake up just] due to
<br>
self-organization of any noise in the circuitry&quot;  is a very strong
<br>
statement of the thesis that intelligent activity is an attractor.
<br>
Stephen J. Gould is the great opponent of such contentions, practically
<br>
saying that progress is impossible, while Kauffman (and others, like
<br>
you) content that it's practically inevitable.  Isn't the same reasoning
<br>
that you are employing here also going to imply that galaxies wake up
<br>
sooner or later too?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The programming time would consist of writing the neural net spec, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic spec, the evolutionary operator, and the game spec.  Efficiency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not be an issue and the only requirement for any degree of initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity would lie in the game.  The network spec, and the genetic spec,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the evolutionary algorithm could all be extremely simple as long as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the genetic spec and network spec were Turing complete.
</em><br>
<p>Just want to make sure here:  a sufficient condition for the architecture
<br>
to be &quot;Turing complete&quot;, as you are using it,  is for it to encompass a
<br>
Universal Turing Machine, i.e., if all functions which can be calculated
<br>
with a Turing Machine, could be programmed.  This certainly is the default
<br>
assumption about all typical computers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Getting a non-lunar-sized piece of computronium to wake up is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicated.
</em><br>
<p>Why would that be, if you weren't in any particular hurry?   Suppose we
<br>
put the deadline to be a billion years---or any other limit small enough
<br>
so that we are not simply waiting for thermal or quantum fluctuations
<br>
to accidentally create an SI---from what you've said, a few million CPUs
<br>
with high-bandwidth links would suffice.  Then you believe that with a few
<br>
weeks' work, you could get the software to implement a &quot;genetic code that
<br>
fills up the partitions with neural-network elements, and an arbitrarily
<br>
complex competitive game in which moves are signaled by the outputs of
<br>
those elements&quot;, and then the whole thing would wake up in a billion years?
