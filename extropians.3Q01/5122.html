<br>
This is same argument that is always made
<br>
<em>&gt; against new products 'Why make them, only the rich will get them'  At one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point in time Automobiles, let alone choices in them, were confined to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rich.  Electricity was confined to the rich.  Running water, waste
</em><br>
<em>&gt; management, heat, etc. etc. etc  were ALL, at one time, confined to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rich.  Competition and capitalism has brought ALL of these things within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realm of the average person.   You are basically saying 'Why privatize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schools, only the rich will benefit'  this is completely and totally untrue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Capitalism and competition by definition will make higher quality products
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and services more available at continually decreasing prices.  Capitalism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the natural selection of goods and services.
</em><br>
<p>I entirely agree, and thank you for pointing that out. In contrast to
<br>
capitalism, one might consider the educational benefits of socialism,
<br>
especially famous socialist teachers such as Stalin, who taught 30,000,000
<br>
people how to die, or National Socialist Adolph Hitler who graduated tens of
<br>
millions in his special education classes. Then there was the Maoist brand of
<br>
socialist education that taught many more millions of  students how to starve
<br>
to death..
<br>
<p>Responsible and intelligent people should always remember the lessons that
<br>
socialism teaches.
