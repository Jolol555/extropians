<a href="mailto:tsebok@findlaw.com?Subject=Re:%20Should%20claims%20based%20on%20African%20American%20slavery%20be%20litigated%20in%20the%20courts?&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGAEKFHKAA.altamiratexas@earthlink.net&gt;">tsebok@findlaw.com</a>
<p>This article is Part Two of a two-part series by Professor Sebok on the
possibility of reparations for African-American slavery. Part One of this
series appears on Writ in the archive of Professor Sebok's articles, along
with Parts One and Two of his earlier series of articles on reparations for
Holocaust forced labor. — Ed.
<p>In Part One of this two-part series of columns, I explored the historical
and doctrinal changes that have brought together civil rights attorneys and
class action lawyers to pursue damages for African-Americans' slavery using
the tort law system. In this second Part, I want to explore the much more
difficult questions of how these moral claims might also be framed as legal
ones, and whether they should be thus framed in the first place.
<p>Who Are the Defendants?
<p>As one of the class action attorneys participating in the &quot;Reparations
Assessment Group&quot; commented in Harpers Magazine this year, the first
question in a class action is never &quot;who are the plaintiffs.&quot; The first
question is: &quot;who are the defendants?&quot; Asking that question in the context
of a possible tort case based upon African-American slavery leads to a
complex answer.
<p>To begin, the federal government is an unlikely defendant. It has been sued
in the past by descendants of African slaves for a number of kinds of
damages, and such suits have been dismissed. In 1995, the Ninth Circuit
affirmed that the Federal Tort Claims Act — which waives the government's
&quot;sovereign immunity&quot; in some situations, but retains it in others — bars
such suits.
<p>Similarly, while there has been scant discussion of suits against the state
governments of the states that made up the former Confederacy, I would
imagine that these states also protected by sovereign immunity.
<p>This leaves individuals and corporations. It is possible that some of the
great families of the South, and perhaps even Northern families involved in
the maritime slave trade, have passed on wealth derived from slavery to
individual descendants in amounts large enough to be both identifiable as
the profits of slavery, and worth pursuing—but I doubt it. Furthermore, the
law does, at some point, protect innocent holders of stolen and wrongfully
obtained property — and whether or not the descendants of the slaveholders
are properly considered morally innocent, they would likely be considered
legally innocent, since they were not involved in the original torts.
<p>The problem of size, identity and &quot;the innocent holder&quot; is much less
burdensome when one targets corporations. As with the claims in the
Holocaust suits, corporations make a very tempting target for the class
action lawyer. Why? First, they often have huge cash reserves. Second, being
creatures of bureaucracy, they often have extremely well maintained records
that, in the hand of a careful archivist, can yield useful information going
back 50 or 100 years. Third, the law concerning the obligations of successor
corporations makes it easier to sue a company that has been sold and merged
twenty times than a tenth-generation Virginian.
<p>Finally, corporations are subject to the pressures of public opinion and
media criticism in ways that make them often more willing to settle lawsuits
that connect their products to controversy. Significantly, the insurance
company Aetna recently apologized for having sold insurance to slave owners
for the value of the slaves. Even though Aetna did not itself use slave
labor, it felt that by selling insurance, it could be seen as having
accepted the Southern view that people could be property, and having helped
support the slave economy. (Of course, Aetna still refuses to pay
compensation beyond its apology — but the apology alone suggests, at a
minimum, a concern over what the public will think, and that is the same
type of concern that often inspires settlement.)
<p>What Would the Causes Of Action Be?
<p>After deciding whom to sue, the slavery reparations team will also have to
answer another question: what would the legal claims — or, in lawyers'
terminology, the &quot;causes of action,&quot; be?
<p>It is premature to draw too many conclusions about what is in the minds of
the Reparations Assessment Group's members, but the truth is, the lawsuits
could only follow a few well-worn paths. As I mentioned in my last column,
slavery, despite the political and historical rationalizations that were
erected by its apologists, represented, among other things, an incalculably
large number of torts inflicted upon millions and millions of Africans and
their descendants born in America.
<p>To kidnap someone is not just a crime, but also a tort— as is beating her,
forcing her to work without pay, separating her from her family. The list
could go on and on. Each of these torts can be the basis of a civil suit for
money damages, both compensatory and punitive.
<p>The Statute of Limitations Problem
<p>As the Reparations Assessment Group has acknowledged, there is a very
serious problem with framing their claim as a demand for damages in tort:
the statute of limitations, which sets a finite number of years during which
a claim may be brought.
<p>Most statute of limitations for tort claims are between one and six years
after the victim (or his survivor) discovers the wrongful act by the
defendant. It is hard to see how, for these claims, that period of time has
not come and gone.
<p>Granted, a statute of limitations may be extended if the defendant has
actively concealed his wrongdoing. And it may even be the case that by all
rights, the statute of limitations for the torts of slavery should be
extended because African-Americans were not allowed access to the courts in
any meaningful way for many, many years — even long after the Thirteenth
Amendment was passed — but a court would probably find that, at least by the
1970's, African-Americans can be said to have had reasonably fair court
access. And even starting the clock ticking then would mean many of the
statutes have run.
<p>If that is true, the consequence may be a moral injustice, but not a legal
one — for the whole point of a statute of limitations is to allow wrongdoers
off the hook eventually, in the interest of stabilizing expectations as to
whether suit will or will not be brought against them.
<p>Solving the Limitations Problem: Can the Unjust Enrichment Doctrine Work?
<p>There are a few ways around the statute of limitations problem. One would be
to change the statute of limitations by legislation. (As California did in
order to insure that certain Holocaust suits would not be time-barred.)
Another is to base the tort claims on international law, a move that might
dramatically affect the applicability of statute of limitations.
<p>But the most frequently discussed maneuver is to change the nature of the
claim. Some — including Randall Robinson, the author of The Debt: What
America Owes to Blacks — have argued that the simplest, most direct way to
frame a legal claim would be to pursue a claim for unjust enrichment against
anyone who currently possesses property (or the fruits of property) that
resulted from the torts inflicted on African-Americans during slavery.
<p>Unjust enrichment has traditionally been a sleepy backwater of American law.
It is usually viewed as a doctrine governing what remedy a plaintiff who has
succeeded on another cause of action may request — not as a cause of action
in itself.
<p>Recently, however, unjust enrichment causes of action have been popping up
in some interesting cases. For example, one of the claims made by Richard
Scruggs (a Reparations Assessment Group lawyer) in his lawsuit, on behalf of
Mississippi against the tobacco industry, was that tobacco companies were
unjustly enriched by Mississippi's health insurance payments. This claim was
copied by many other states, and arguably played a critical role in
producing a $368 billion settlement. And it was stated as a claim in
itself — not just a request for a remedy.
<p>Since unjust enrichment is an &quot;equitable&quot; doctrine—it merely asks the court
to do justice, or &quot;equity,&quot; by returning lost property to its rightful
owner—it is not affected by statute of limitations in exactly the same way
as claims for damages in tort might be. Still, prevailing on an unjust
enrichment claim is no walk in the park.
<p>Many people think Scruggs' Mississippi unjust enrichment claim was a bluff
that would have collapsed in front of an alert appellate court. There are
doctrines such as laches (which faults plaintiffs for waiting too long to
sue) and other equitable concerns that make it difficult for an aggrieved
party to sue for the return of property after very long periods of time.
Still, it might be argued that claims based on slavery are so different from
typical claims for restitution that the equities will always weigh in favor
of the plaintiffs.
<p>A Concern about the Use of an Unjust Enrichment Claim
<p>Nonetheless, I want to raise a cautionary note about approaching slavery
from the perspective of unjust enrichment. Law is often a powerful tool to
help achieve nonlegal ends. But law contains its own messages as well. The
words we use to claim victory over our opponents do not just affect the
court and jury; they shape us as well. And that could happen here.
<p>The decision to treat the legacy of slavery as a private law problem to be
resolved in the courts between citizens (or citizens and corporations) — and
not just a problem of public law to be addressed by the government —
contains its own symbolism, and conveys a message which may be, in the main,
quite salutary. That message is this: The wrongs of slavery were not just
inflicted by governments; they were quintessentially motivated by the greed
and cruelty of private persons.
<p>But our analysis cannot end there. A further question must be asked: what
were the private wrongs? The virtue of tort law is that it gives us a
vocabulary with which to describe and remedy wrongful treatment by one
person to another. The focus is on the wrong done, and not only the damage
caused.
<p>Bringing tort claims such as claims for assault, battery, kidnapping, and
false imprisonment would correctly highlight the wrongs done in slavery —
and, crucially, the basic wrong of slavery itself. Slavery would have been
wrong even if, as is sometime said of the Greeks in Roman times, the slaves
were treated well.
<p>In contrast, bringing an unjust enrichment claim would focus on the shifts
of wealth and property that slavery caused. I well understand why the
Reparations Assessment Group wants to step away from tort law and towards
claims rooted in unjust enrichment; the barriers of statute of limitations
seem too high. But this step comes with a cost: to call the wrong of slavery
a failure to pay for forced labor is to suggest that the wrong of slavery is
that, after they were kidnapped, beaten, and abused, Africans and their
descendants were not salaried.
<p>It might be said that my concerns are misplaced, for no one expects full
damages to be paid or even calculated. These lawsuits are symbolic, and
hence their goal is to open up a political dialogue about slavery and the
unacknowledged depth of the injuries it caused to millions of individuals.
<p>Perhaps. But it is precisely because law does operate on the level of
symbolism that I am concerned. Some are discomforted by the fact the World
Jewish Congress has chosen the &quot;symbol&quot; of lost wages to represent the
horror of the Holocaust. I am one of them. It seems to be an inapt symbol;
one that does little honor to those who died, and one that seems to offer
little in the way of education to those who want to know why the Holocaust
was a horror.
<p>I have the same fear for a class action for the lost wages of African
American slaves, were such a suit to be brought by the Reparations
Assessment Group. One should choose a symbol because it says what one means,
not because it is the only way to win a lawsuit.
