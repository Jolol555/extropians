</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is obvious to me.  We already have this capability.  We do enforce
<br>
this for military targets and for NASA.  We used to enforce this around the
<br>
White House and the Pentagon, but these rules were relaxed in recent years.
<br>
They could easily be reimplemented.  I think the buildings should have
<br>
anti-aircraft missiles on them.
<br>
<p>The security measures used on Israeli airlines are also easy to implement.
<br>
We never thought these were necessary in the U.S. before, so we never did
<br>
this.  The solutions are easy, and the technology is in place.
<br>
<p>I have done many anti-terrorist plans for larger clients, many in New York.
<br>
Most of them agreed in theory, but didn't think the threat was great enough.
<br>
Keeping parking away from the front of the building, not allowing package
<br>
deliveries to the front door, not having large glass windows to the street,
<br>
are all obvious precautions.  Most clients choose to ignore these
<br>
precautions for the convenience of closer parking, package delivery, and
<br>
large windows.
<br>
<p>I applaud the increased security measures at airports.  As a security
<br>
consultant, I travel weekly and constantly cringe at what I see.  I already
<br>
knew that the perimeter of airports block large knives from coming in while
<br>
knives were available inside.  I already knew that every airport trusts the
<br>
security screening of incoming passengers from other airports, such that the
<br>
weakest link at any airport anywhere in the U.S. can be used to get into the
<br>
most secure airport anywhere in the U.S.  I also know there is a problem at
<br>
the metal detectors where the security personnel don't have any power to do
<br>
anything.  This was proven recently when a man with a gun just drew the gun
<br>
and walked through and onto an airplane.  The metal detectors are &quot;detection
<br>
devices&quot; in security analysis, but they are not &quot;prevention&quot; or &quot;auditing&quot;.
<br>
They functioned correctly and tell people that a gun just went through.
<br>
They have no means to stop it or determine who the person is.  The perimeter
<br>
analysis of an airport, or a functional analysis of the security procedures
<br>
show obvious gaps.
<br>
<p>People laugh at the lack of curb-side check in now.  What this really means
<br>
is that the airport won't accept your baggage until after you have shown ID
<br>
at the counter, had a name-search check, and been verified as a passenger.
<br>
It was ludicrous to allow unverified strangers to drop off packages to be
<br>
put on a plane.
<br>
<p>The same is true for e-tickets.  The e-ticket allowed one to pick up the
<br>
ticket at the gate just before boarding.  This allowed unticketed people to
<br>
get into the airport, check baggage, get past security and go almost
<br>
anywhere in the airport, even if they had no business with the airport or
<br>
any travel arrangements.  Forcing people to get a ticket before they are
<br>
allowed access makes perfect sense to me.
<br>
<p>I think that people should go through metal detectors at each layover.  This
<br>
would prevent people from picking up items within the airport and traveling
<br>
with them.  It would prevent airports from trusting other airports'
<br>
security.  It also would prevent terrorists from knowing whether they got
<br>
past security or not before the board the plane.  The security screening
<br>
would be repeated.  It would be harder to implement, but much safer if we
<br>
actually had metal detectors right at the aircraft.  If we could screen
<br>
persons as they board, it would be closer to the perimeter we are trying to
<br>
protect.  (By metal-detector, I mean any generic weapons detection.)
<br>
<p>I think the airline could do a background check on every passenger.  If they
<br>
are illegally in this country, wanted on a warrant, or cannot be verified
<br>
with their real identity, the airlines can refuse entry.  I also think that
<br>
airlines should not do their own security.  One of the basic tenets of
<br>
security is that operations should not secure themselves.  Whenever a choice
<br>
between cost and security occurs, such operations tend to lower security to
<br>
save money.  Third-party monitoring is the way to do.  This is the idea
<br>
behind peer-review, scientific experimental method, open-source software,
<br>
and most design procedures.
<br>
<p>Our current airport security structure just plain ignores basic tenets of
<br>
security design.  We used to ignore security because people did not believe
<br>
that the risks were real or great.  Now we know better, and I expect
<br>
security to become more important.
