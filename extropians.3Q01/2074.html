<em>&gt;From: &quot;Sean Kenny&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:seankenny@blueyonder.co.uk?Subject=Re:%20Welfare%20(was%20Re:%20capitalist%20religion)&In-Reply-To=&lt;200107241950.MAA23896@well.com&gt;">seankenny@blueyonder.co.uk</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;I don't think anyone in Europe would recognize US welfare as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resembling anything that we would consider welfare.
</em><br>
<p>Sean, I'd appreciate a brief description.
<br>
<p>Here in the U.S. it became a multi-generational thing, some
<br>
families were going on to the great-grandchildren stage and still
<br>
&quot;on the dole&quot; as some say. A complete waste of human potential.
<br>
<p>We are not completely heartless, it still exists, although most
<br>
states have instituted &quot;workfare&quot; programs instead. It now carries
<br>
a maximum participation of two years I believe.
<br>
<p>Before I took the job here in the data center, I used to work &quot;out
<br>
in the field&quot; servicing commercial accounts. I used to get mostly
<br>
things like welfare and unemployment offices because they are
<br>
usually located in &quot;bad&quot; areas. I used this time productively,
<br>
observing the clients as well as talking to the various social
<br>
workers, so I come by my knowledge by direct experience as well as
<br>
honestly.
<br>
<p>As I indicated in another post, Thomas Stanley's research with
<br>
millionaires shows the exact same pattern, those who receive
<br>
handouts do less well than their peers. This data leads me to
<br>
conclude that guaranteed income schemes are doomed to failure.
<br>
<p>In trying to do good you can do terrible wrong.
<br>
<p>I believe in the old Chinese proverb &quot;Give a man a fish and you
<br>
feed him for a day, but teach a man to fish and you feed him for
<br>
the rest of his life&quot;.
<br>
<p>Sound wisdom....
<br>
