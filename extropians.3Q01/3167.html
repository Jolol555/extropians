I had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Let the homophobes, the socialists, the racists, the religious,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the luddites, the reactionaries, the anarchists, the statists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and all the others whose opinions are likely to be unpopular here
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; speak up.  We'll take them all on!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;...
</em><br>
<p>and Charles Hixson responded
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is perhaps not the wisest attitude.  People generally have a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finite amount of attention to devote to details ... whatever they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose to consider details.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, yes.  I hadn't meant that as an open invitation :-)
<br>
I was speaking instead merely to the way that one *would*
<br>
respond to unpopular ideas, if one had the time.  The 
<br>
attitude that I wished to convey was that there is no
<br>
claim whatsoever that cannot be logically and patiently
<br>
criticized (in the sense of pan-critical rationalism).
<br>
I hope that my meaning is now clear (you aren't the first
<br>
to wonder).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It was said earlier that &lt;plonk&gt;ing someone was a kind of self 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; censorship.  And this is true.  It's also true, however, that any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual will need to restrict the focus of their awareness.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.
<br>
