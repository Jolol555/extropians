<p>Safety is a statistical concept. Just as I argued for friendly AIs, what we 
<br>
want is as much safety as we can get, but we will have to accept that it will 
<br>
not be perfect. 
<br>
<p>I think Brin makes a good point in the transparent society (which is often 
<br>
overlooked as we get into the crypto-vs-camera escalation discussions) that 
<br>
the important think is keeping the society open and healthy. That is the main 
<br>
goal. Privacy might be important but is really just a means for making a 
<br>
society worth living in, and there might be reasons to regard other means for 
<br>
keeping society nice as more important. Accountability is of course the 
<br>
obvious one; it can to a large extent deal with the above-mentioned problems 
<br>
on various levels. 
<br>
<p>Imperfect societies can be made liveable if we add the right feedback loops 
<br>
to reward nice behavior and punish bad behavior (they don't even have to be 
<br>
put into place centrally, quite a few are Hayekian spontaneous orders like 
<br>
unwritten rules of courtesy and neighbourhood relations). This will not turn 
<br>
them perfect, but change the probabilities of things happening (sometimes to 
<br>
very large degrees). I'm less convinced about that &quot;barriers&quot;, things 
<br>
intended to prevent certain actions from being taken (like encryptions, locks 
<br>
and pre-progammed friendliness), can produce the liveable society. In some 
<br>
situations they work by making costs of ill-doing high (it is harder to read 
<br>
en encrypted file or pick a lock than it would be without the barrier), but I 
<br>
can't see them helping to reward nice behavior.
