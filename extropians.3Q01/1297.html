<em>&gt;From: Miriam English &lt;<a href="mailto:miriam@werple.net.au?Subject=Re:%20capitalist%20religion&In-Reply-To=&lt;200107171453.HAA13222@well.com&gt;">miriam@werple.net.au</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;My point above (even though it is really only a side issue to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;main point) still stands. You are simply arguing that it is not as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;privatised as it could be. Undoubtedly that is true. What I said
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was that the US health market is probably the most privatised in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the world. It is also the most expensive. To get a broken leg
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fixed in US is way more expensive than in Australia. (Forget drugs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- just basic health care: x-ray, cast, physiotherapy.) Australia
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has mostly had a publicly funded health system in the past. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recent years politicians who have been mesmerised by the economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rationalist religion have been dismantling that and the costs for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;health have been rising as a result. One of our states,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Queensland, has always had the most public hospital system in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Australia. Health care in that state is cheap and universal, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the same high quality elsewhere in Oz.
</em><br>
<p>If I needed to have a broken leg fixed, it might cost me $150 if I
<br>
hadn't met my deductable that year, the same as it would cost if I
<br>
needed heart bypass surgery. Of course if I needed bypass surgery
<br>
I would be wheeled from the E.R. directly to surgery if needed, not
<br>
placed on a waiting list.
<br>
<p>American hospitals are filled with patients from &quot;universal&quot; health
<br>
care countries.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Health is just one of the things that I believe the capitalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system  manages very badly. It is great for many other things, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in fact it is even good at certain aspects of medicine. But take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;balance and control out of the health system and it is like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cutting the brake lines on a car: it may get you somewhere very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fast but do you really want to be on board when it gets there?
</em><br>
<p><p>I have rarely needed the american health care system, but it has
<br>
always been there and done an excellent job.
<br>
<p>My only exposure to a &quot;universal&quot; health care system was as a
<br>
member of the military. An experience I wouldn't go through again
<br>
without a gun to my head.
