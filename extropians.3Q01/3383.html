<p>
I am a Software Engineer, and an amateur linguist.  I have been interested
<br>
in languages (both human and computer) and thought for some time.
<br>
<p>My take on the Sapir-Worf hypothesis is that it is a one-way relationship
<br>
which people try to apply both ways.  If you know the word for something,
<br>
then you know that concept. If you don't know a word for something, then you
<br>
may have difficulty with a concept.  People go too far and say that you
<br>
can't understand the concept without the word.
<br>
<p>Words also shape the way you think.  A lot of people don't question words
<br>
and names, and therefore accept inaccurate or imprecise words.  Here's a
<br>
good example:  What color is the sky?  Almost every one says &quot;blue&quot; because
<br>
that is the word that is always associated with the sky.  However, I will
<br>
tell you that it is &quot;blue-green&quot;.  Before you argue, go to a paint program
<br>
and look at the color that computers call &quot;cyan&quot;.  &quot;Cyan&quot; is the same color
<br>
as the sky, but if you look up it's definition, it is equal parts of blue
<br>
and green.  The sky is half way between green and blue, yet by English
<br>
tradition, we always call it &quot;blue&quot;.
