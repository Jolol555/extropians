I don't usually post &quot;me, too&quot; posts, but I have to say this is 1) brilliant
<br>
and 2) brilliantly written.
<br>
<p>I would suggest only one addition:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Be especially nice to people from the Middle East for a while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they could infiltrate the enemy and they might be willing to if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people treat them respectfully and ask them nicely.
</em><br>
<p>Maintaining the same tone, I would put it:
<br>
<p>&quot;Be especially nice to people from the Middle East for a while.  Innocents
<br>
who come from or whose parents came from this region need the friendship of
<br>
others more than ever now, and, they could infiltrate the enemy and they
<br>
might be willing to if people treat them respectfully and ask them nicely.&quot;
<br>
<p>William, may I pass this on?  I STRONGLY encourage you to send this to as
<br>
many publications as possible.  I will post it far and wide.

Subject: Sleepers, a possible solution.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There are terrorists living in this country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many terrorists may belong to a particular culture or &quot;race&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The situation is similar to driving a car of the same type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recently used by a bank robber in your community.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We do not want the bank robber to walk around unquestioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we do not want to hassle innocent people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is a simple solution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Befriend the people you are suspicious of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Be nice to them.  Get to know them.  Invite them to dinner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you spend enough time befriending someone you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually figure out if the are friend, foe, or neutral.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes you will find out that your suspicions were silly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other times you will find your suspicions reasonable but wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Keep getting to know them until you feel comfortable or scared.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you find nothing to worry about you have made a friend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or been bored for a few hours and made an acquaintance).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you find more and more things that worry you, talk to other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friends and get other people to come and be friendly with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person.  If you are feeling wary be a little careful but stay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendly and respectful.  If you are certain of guilt and feel at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk do what you need to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If someone does not want to be friendly with you that does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean they are a terrorists, they may dislike you, they may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hermit.  Get other people to try.  If they don't want to be friends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with anyone you know and trust, then keep yours eyes on them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until you figure out whether or not they are dangerous.  The whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, be nice, friendly, respectful, etc.  It will not hurt you much to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a little nice to a bad person (as long as you are careful).  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will do no real harm to the hermit or jerk.  You will be doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good thing for nice people who just happen to superficially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resemble people you fear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is hard for terrorists to infiltrate a community.  It is easy for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists to infiltrate a paranoid or insensitive society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Be especially nice to people from the Middle East for a while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they could infiltrate the enemy and they might be willing to if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people treat them respectfully and ask them nicely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If anyone has feedback or ideas for further refining or practicing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these concepts let me know.  Feel free to spread the idea or this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post around.  I think it is a good concept.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will
</em><br>
