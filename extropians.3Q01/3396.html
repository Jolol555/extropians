<em>&gt;From: Aina &amp; Bones &lt;<a href="mailto:goldengarden@arjang.mail.telia.com?Subject=Re:%20Heresy&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108071914.MAA14025@well.com&gt;">goldengarden@arjang.mail.telia.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Is Extropianism mainly for American's? How many Europeans are on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this list and how much, if any, european philosophy is in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Extropianism?
</em><br>
<p>There are a number of Europeans on this list, and many of us are
<br>
descended from Europeans, and of course we are all descended from
<br>
Africans. Since Max formulated the principals and is originally
<br>
from England, the answer is yes. (tongue firmly in cheek)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;How will the transhumanist movement deal with people's fears: the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pessimism/realism that experience engenders? Will technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really change how people are or will people have to do that for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves? 
</em><br>
<p>By using rationalism to dispel fear, and occasionally turning on
<br>
the hall light to prove there really is nothing hiding under the
<br>
bed.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The degree of optimism on this list concerning the future is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;definitely infectious and I'd really love it to be as e.g.. Mr.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Broderick envisions but People have milked the meme concerning the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power of science to improve the human condition to death.
</em><br>
<p>We will attempt to milk it to life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The egg heads (no offense intended) have been saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technology will solve this and that and remove this and that for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;centuries now. Technology has indeed developed the cures for many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;diseases and increased crop harvests etc. but most people don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get the benefit of it.
</em><br>
<p>This is largely do to obsolete belief systems, including but not
<br>
limited to their economic and political systems. We work to correct
<br>
this, largely by practical demonstration.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Will what most people get out of a time and technology that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;produce diamond houses cheaply be a diamond bullet in the head? If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not why?
</em><br>
<p>A very long healthy lifespan which they can put to numerous good
<br>
uses, see Mortimer Adler on the correct use of leisure.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Will Transhumanism become a sort of super technocratic society in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which technologists develop technology only for themselves or can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;others join? Will it be the third word that matches: aristocracy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;racism.......... transhumanism?
</em><br>
<p>See the Extropian principals.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;After all this biotech superman thing is basically a child of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;National Socialism. Sure, now one can in theory claim that with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gene manipulation even defectives CAN be healed. WILL they be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;healed?
</em><br>
<p>I don't see the national socialism origin.  Yes to those suffering
<br>
defects being healed. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Are the words can and should synonyms?
</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Over the time (years) that I have been a member of this list I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have, from time to time, noticed what I (perhaps wrongly)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpret to be disdain for poor/uneducated/less intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people in many postings so I wonder  Will everybody get a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;body or will there be a races of super humans and slave race that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;serve them?
</em><br>
<p>I am not aware of anyone here disdaining poor/uneducated/less
<br>
intelligent here, we still have vast differences on how best to
<br>
help them.
<br>
<p>No one here is out to create a master race, we are interested in
<br>
advancing human evolution to the next level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What is to stop Transhumanism from becoming the scientific arm of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future dictatorships?
</em><br>
<p>Transhumans themselves, worry more about a theocracy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Can Libertarianism be summed up like this: all the freedom,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;justice, health and life that money can buy. If so how does that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change things from the way they are now?
</em><br>
<p><p>I'll leave this to party members.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Is or will Transhumanism be nothing more than intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;confusion, moral imbecility, and willful ugliness elaborated into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a self-conscious ideology: the worship of wealth, power, novelty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and machinery? Will it become the ultimate expression of what many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;call a culture less and materialist America: a sort of burger and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;coke religion?
</em><br>
<p>God I hope not (joke)! I think rather than a self-conscious
<br>
ideology, you mean a self-healing tautology, and no this is not
<br>
where we are headed.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Must Transhumanism demand spiritual pathology. Obviously not since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mr. Broderick seems to allow for something else, as it were, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how many transhumans can make allowances for that which they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cannot see?
</em><br>
<p><p>You seem to be basing alot of your questions on Damien's work, have
<br>
you read the extropian principals? 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;For me the ends justify the means but it seems that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Transhumanism the means is the end. Is this a fair judgment?
</em><br>
<p>This is a bit too simplistic in my estimation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There are those who say that Libertarians and individualists are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most likely to be solely concerned with their own egotistical and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Narcissistic gratification. Since there are a few here on the list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I ask would you refute this claim and how/why?
</em><br>
<p>Anyone concerned with only themselves I would say is unbalanced.
<br>
(and lonely) 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;How would a Transhumanist egalitarian/collectivist effort express
</em><br>
<em>&gt;itself? Would they go for a Borg type society as in Star Trekk?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not interested in either egalitarian or necessarily
<br>
collectivist efforts so the answer is N/A.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why not find ways of extending the use of our already existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brains instead of making new ones? If the mind can work outside of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the human body why go for any form of containment at all? Is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible to exist without limits?
</em><br>
<p>We can already make computational elements out of superior
<br>
materials, when we learn to master the architecture we can move our
<br>
thoughts if we wish. The size of the human brain and therefore it's
<br>
potential is limited currently by the size of the birth canal,
<br>
another limit to overcome.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Since our instincts and emotions are our driving forces if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;insulate ourselves from them or get rid of them what will our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;motivating force be?
</em><br>
<p>Instincts and emotions are also thought processes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Are people in general in greater danger of being mistreated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumans/extropians than, white people are of being mistreated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by negroes?
</em><br>
<p>??????
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;In attempting to become more than human will we become less?
</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Don't get me wrong. I'm not against science and technology. I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;install a bionic leg today if I could -_-  It's just that I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lived a lot of my life in what you would call primitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circumstances and have taken a long time to learn about all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different stuff you guys talk about here.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;In reading up I have found questions which have bothered me but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;did not want to trouble you all with my lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge/understanding. However since some people on this list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seriously wanted to discuss whether or not white people are nicer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than black people I figured that my questions won't be the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stupid ever brought up on the list.
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't aware anyone was discussing whether whites are nicer than
<br>
blacks, but your questions are welcome anyway.
