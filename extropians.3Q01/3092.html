<em>&gt; &gt; I am disappointed that a racist thread has turned up on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the extropians list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have said repeatedly that this should be looked upon as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welcome challenge to be met, but there has been no response to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my statement.  Of course, you don't mean &quot;racist thread&quot;, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean a discussion of racism.  I repeat, if extropians simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot handle uncomfortable ideas, then how in the world can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we ever hope that non-extropians should come to grips with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cloning, uploading, immortality, or the Spike?
</em><br>
<p>There are some on the extropians list who have demonstrated an inherent
<br>
inability to calmly discuss uncomfortable ideas, or to look at the real
<br>
data with anything but a jaundiced approach contorted by propaganda.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The denials of racism by some of the (plonked) individuals here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; remind me of a statement by someone I knew years ago: &quot;I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; racist. I can't help that blacks are stupid.&quot; I was astonished,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but no amount of explanation could convince him of the absurdity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of what he said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wow!  First, do you know that &quot;plonked&quot; means that someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has engaged an automatic process by which (roughly speaking)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a certain person's posts never even get to his mailbox?
</em><br>
<p>I assume that the individual is referring to me, as if their own
<br>
plonking of me somehow equates to a list-wide condemnation of my
<br>
comments, no matter how out-of-context they were taken. I also find it
<br>
quite revealing that the same individuals who accuse me of being racist
<br>
are also the same individuals who have acted the most viciously against
<br>
me over firearms, capitalism, and other libertarian issues.
<br>
<p>I challenge ANYONE on this list to find any time, any place where I have
<br>
said something to the effect that blacks are inherently inferior. I have
<br>
made significant recent posts with lengthy commentary on what I think is
<br>
the real reason why there remains a chronic lack of socio-economic
<br>
mobility by blacks in the US, and it's got nothing to do with genetics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If this isn't a frightened tactic of self-censorship, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know what is.  (I hasten to add, that quite often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experienced discussion list members employ plonking not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent their eyes from meeting disagreeable points of view,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but rather because someone's posts over a great deal of time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have shown themselves to be without content, or too long, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some other non-partisan cause.)
</em><br>
<p>I find that people claim to 'plonk' you, but do not actually set up a
<br>
filter, they are simply trying to make an ad hominem attack in a manner
<br>
that is consistent with list behavior. I've only set up a filter once,
<br>
for one person, and did not publicize the fact for quite a while. Public
<br>
plonking is merely melodramatic ad hominem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, what that person said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I'm not racist. I can't help that blacks are stupid.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is *not* necessarily absurd, as you claim.  It may be entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong; it may be a gross over-generalization; it may be so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utterly an unqualified assertion that it absolutely demands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refutation---but it's not absurd.  
</em><br>
<p>Furthermore, it is entirely consistent with the book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;,
<br>
which has been roundly condemned in political circles, but its attackers
<br>
are rather weak in attacking the actual data it is based on. They do
<br>
better when they question the behavior attributed to the data.
