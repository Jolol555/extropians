<p>
Ken MacLeod's terrific new novel COSMONAUT KEEP (not yet available, I
<br>
gather, in the USA) offers a charming account of the silence in the skies.
<br>
An alien-engineered asteroid is found, typical of the Oort cloud manifold
<br>
of gods:
<br>
<p>==========
<br>
<p>`They are like the micro-organisms that produce the calcareous mats which
<br>
build up to stromatolites... Except that what they build are not stacks of
<br>
stone, but something between a larger organism and a computer, to put it
<br>
crudely. To put it delicately, they build quasi-organic mechanisms of
<br>
incredible beauty and diversity. The basic unit, the builder, is something
<br>
like an extremophile nanobacterium. Obviously these are not the seats of
<br>
consciousness, any more than our neurones are. Collectively, though, they
<br>
build something greater than themselves.' [...]
<br>
<p>`They are not a collective mind as a whole - there are more separate minds
<br>
in this asteroid than there would be in, let us say, a human Galactic
<br>
Empire, if such a thing could be.' [...]
<br>
<p>`...there are  billions of the fuckers. There are more... communities...
<br>
like this around the solar system than there are people on Earth.' [...]
<br>
<p>`They're everywhere?'
<br>
<p>He shrugged. `Around a lot of stars, yeah, quite possibly. Trafficking,
<br>
communicating, maybe even travelling. They have conscious control over
<br>
their own outgassing, they have computing power to die for, and it only
<br>
takes a nudge to change their orbits. It might take millions of years
<br>
between stars, sure, but these guys have a long attention span.'
<br>
<p>`And what do they actually do?'
<br>
<p>`From the point of view of us busy little primates, they don't do much.
<br>
Hang out and take in the view. Travel around the sun every few million
<br>
years. Maybe travel to another sun and go around that a few times.
<br>
*Bo*-ring.' He put on a whining, childish voice. `Are we *there* yet? [...]
<br>
But from their point of view, they are having fun. Endless, absorbing,
<br>
ecstatic and for all I know orgasmic fun. Discourse, intercourse - at their
<br>
level it's probably the same fucking thing... They're like gods, man, and
<br>
they're literally in heaven. In all their infinite - well, OK, unbounded -
<br>
diversity they have, we understand, a pretty unanimous view on one thing.
<br>
They don't like spam. [...] As far as they're concerned, we are great
<br>
lumbering spambots, corrupted servers, liable at any moment or any megayear
<br>
to start turning out millions of pointless, slightly varied replicas of
<br>
ourselves. Most of what we're likely to want to do if we expanded seriously
<br>
into space is spam. Space industries - spam. Moravec uploads - spam on a
<br>
plate. Von Neumann machines - spam and chips. Space settlements - spam,
<br>
spam, spam, eggs and spam.'
<br>
<p>`[...] Where all this gets political is that it didn't take long for us to
<br>
realize that the ultimate engine of spam is capitalism. Endless expansion
<br>
is the great capitalist wet-dream, and it's totally incompatible with the
<br>
way the universe really is. It's certainly incompatible with what the
<br>
overwhelmingly dominant form of intelligent life is willing to accept.
<br>
Quite frankly, I'm no Part hack myself but the fact of the matter is that
<br>
the Party's aim of a steady-state society with a bit of sustainable,
<br>
careful, non-invasive space exploration is the only kind of society tat the
<br>
aliens are likely to be happy with. [...] The dream you guys have of
<br>
treating the solar system as raw material for orbital mobile homes, guns
<br>
and beer-cans is *right out*.'
<br>
<p>=================
<br>
<p>Screams of outrage and pain should be directed to
<br>
<p>Ken MacLeod &lt;<a href="mailto:ken@libertaria.demon.co.uk?Subject=Re:%20Fermi%20`paradox':%20the%20spam%20explanation&In-Reply-To=&lt;3.0.6.32.20010915120537.007bace0@ariel.its.unimelb.edu.au&gt;">ken@libertaria.demon.co.uk</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>from whose novel I quote without permission; bear in mind also, as usual,
<br>
that *MacLeod* did not make the statements cited above, his *fictional
<br>
characters* did. I strongly recommend the book, and look forward to its
<br>
sequels (and how often can you say that about sequels?).
