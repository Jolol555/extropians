<p><em>&gt; 	If by &quot;aliens&quot; you mean the Little Grey Men of standard UFO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lore, then 5% [of their being real] doesn't seem totally unreasonable...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would guess somewhere around 1%.  The key is to drop the assumtion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they are aliens, and consider the slight possibility that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be genetically engineered future humans coming back in time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to study us Neanderthals.
</em><br>
<p>I put the odds of anything rather fantastic, such as either of these
<br>
possibilities, at around a million to one, personally.  It just seems
<br>
to me that our conventional explanations of almost everything we know
<br>
fit rather well together.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 	The existence of alien civilizations is also very problematic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Feynman put it best: &quot;Where are they&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>This was Fermi's Question.  Sometime after the war, was it 1950?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If there are any civilizations at all between here and the Coma
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cluster, then space should be teeming with aliens spreading at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relativistic speeds on sand-grain-sized colony ships.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I think so too.  The least bizarre explanation is that we
<br>
are all alone for a billion or so lightyears, at least.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the only major bottleneck is the evolution of complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multicellular life, which took 3 billion years on Earth.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be the only small probability in the Drake Equation.
</em><br>
<p>Could be.  I guess if I had to bet on a weak link in the Drake
<br>
equation, I'd put my money there too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sentinence evolved here in two separate lineages- dolphins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and primates.
</em><br>
<p>There is no evidence that dolphins are as smart as chimpanzees.
<br>
They fail the mirror recognition test, and on other tests that
<br>
researchers have conducted in the past decade, their performance
<br>
is *not* impressive.
