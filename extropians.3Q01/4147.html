<em>&gt; Actually, despite his typical spleen-venting and paranoid mischaracterizations here (the stated policy of the gun control groups he mentions - check their sites - is not to ban handguns or non-assault weapons, such as rifles and shotguns, from all citiz
</em><br>
enry, but to keep them (as much as is possible) out of the hands of the proven criminally and/or mentally irresponsibles without infringing on the right of sane and law-abiding adults to purchase, keep and bear), Mike and I ( and these groups he derides) 
<br>
are in agreement that sane and law-abiding adults should retain the right to keep and bear; the sorts of black eyes that the progun lobby suffer are exemplified by attempts to allow people who fall outside of these characterizations to do so, such as the 
<br>
defence attempt to present Atty. Gen. Ashcroft's testimony in favor of the right to keep and bear, in a Texas case, in support of a man under a restraining order for spousal abuse who subsequently, in a fit of petulant rage at!
<br>
<em>&gt;  t!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hat order, drew and waved his handgun at his horrified wife and daughter.  That guy is outta self-control, and if necessary, his beloved weapon should be removed from his cold, dead fingers by the local constabulary before he guns his terrorized family 
</em><br>
down with it.
<br>
<em>&gt; I also appreciate Mike's removing this discussion to its proper venue on exi-freedom.
</em><br>
<p>Well, since you seem to think it's okay to keep discussing it, I will
<br>
(see what happens when you insist on having the last word?). 
<br>
<p>Dr. Emerson, who is the plaintiff in US v. Emerson did not do what you
<br>
claim he did. His separated wife, months after he caught her and her
<br>
boyfriend in bed together and allegedly threatened them (which is what
<br>
created their divorce proceedings), saw fit to perform some sort of
<br>
sitdown strike in his office: she wouldn't leave his place of business
<br>
and was interfering with his patients. He ordered her to leave, and when
<br>
she wouldn't, he called the police and pulled a gun on her to restrain
<br>
her until the police arrived. His daughter was never around.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, her claims about his 'threats' remained unsubstantiated and
<br>
were never examined in court, he was never afforded his due process
<br>
rights, when the judge unilaterally issued a restraining order.
<br>
<p>Dr. Emerson has never been charged with domestic abuse of any sort, does
<br>
not have a criminal record, while his wife has a record of mental
<br>
instability. Once again, Joe, you are caught in another one of your
<br>
conflations.
