<em>&gt; Bob Black went further by writing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Abolition of Work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.zpub.com/notes/black-work.html">http://www.zpub.com/notes/black-work.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No one should ever work.
</em><br>
<p>This is all well and good, but tell me where survival
<br>
comes from? Apparently we will no longer need money,
<br>
if we no longer work. If we do, though, how do we get
<br>
it--welfare-like distributions? And for that matter,
<br>
if we don't have it, do we turn all houses into small
<br>
personal farms or other production facilities?
<br>
<p>I have a very simplistic way of viewing this because I
<br>
have not thought it out well yet, so please forgive me
<br>
that. But the ultimate result it seems is this: either
<br>
way, distributed money or personal production, it
<br>
appears to be a wonderful way for whatever necessary
<br>
distribution centers to gain control over us or for
<br>
failing personal farms (or communes) to be at the
<br>
mercy of a larger body.
<br>
<p>I would love to eliminate the concept of work. No
<br>
wonder I &quot;play the violin&quot; for a living and yet get
<br>
criticized for not being practical. If I were commonly
<br>
said to &quot;work the violin&quot; people might have a
<br>
different viewpoint.
<br>
<p>And I do work hard, or play hard depending on your
<br>
orientation here. Without frets a violinist worries
<br>
anyway about everything, but then to have the &quot;working
<br>
critic&quot; poop kittycats every time a &quot;violin player&quot;
<br>
makes the slightest miscommunication really takes the
<br>
play out of it.
<br>
<p>Work and play. Slavery and independence. Today,
<br>
yesterday, tomorrow. Connotations, denotations.
<br>
<p>Should I trade a violin lesson for a small basket of
<br>
corn and half gallon of milk? If I did that I wouldn't
<br>
have to pay income taxes. Ha ha ha!
<br>
