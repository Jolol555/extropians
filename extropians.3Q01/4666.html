<p>Actually I'm a late comer to this thread and missed your earlier description 
<br>
of cybergnosticism.  And, while I may not have thought through all the 
<br>
ultimate conclusions, it still seems like a good thing to me.
<br>
<p>I would not go so far as to view the material world as something inherently 
<br>
bad.  The Apple II was not a &quot;bad&quot; computer, but it is outstripped in almost 
<br>
every respect by the G4.  The material world is not &quot;bad&quot; but I believe it 
<br>
will be outstripped in almost every respect by software life.

<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man.

Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
