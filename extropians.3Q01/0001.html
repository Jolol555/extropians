<p>The more I ponder this film, the more it actually grows on me.
<br>
<p>Shelly talked me out of one of my original complaints,
<br>
the linear progression instead of exponential.  She noted
<br>
that the child in &quot;cryogenic&quot; suspension had been given
<br>
up as lost by the medics.  Yet a few months later he was
<br>
revived.  A cure was developed in that much time.  So
<br>
maybe they did have a clue about accelerating change.
<br>
<p>I have mixed feelings about AI, but consider one of the strong
<br>
points, or optimistic attitudes regarding friendly AI.  Unlike
<br>
West World, in this film there is no indication that the AIs
<br>
ever actually raised a hand to harm a human.  The pool
<br>
thing was an accident: the AI didnt intend to actually
<br>
harm his orga brother, he just was trying to get away from
<br>
the other wretched little orga kids.
<br>
<p>At the end, when the mechas were discussing the late
<br>
orgas, there is no indication that there was ever any
<br>
direct *conflict* exactly, or at least no active attempt
<br>
on the part of the mechas to fight the orgas.  There was
<br>
no apparent disdain on the part of the mechas for the
<br>
orgas that I could tell, indeed just the opposite.
<br>
<p>One could imagine a soft ending for humanity where more
<br>
and more orgas chose mechas as companions and lovers.
<br>
They simply failed to reproduce in adequate numbers, finishing
<br>
their mortal lives peacefully with dedicated mechas attending
<br>
to their every need to the last breath.  Now, that kind of
<br>
ending for humanity wouldnt be so bad, eh?  After the
<br>
last human perished, life would go on, and this planet
<br>
would have a shot at a true universal utopia, with our
<br>
mind-children carrying on without us.  Seductive vision, eh?
<br>
<p>I change my rating on AI to about 3 stars outta 5.  spike
