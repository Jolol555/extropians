<p>I play computer video games with other people every day.  I never thought of it
<br>
that way myself.  In a way, the comment would make the people serious about VR
<br>
and uploading defensive, or have that connotation, if they did not consider
<br>
themselves those things, or if they did.  That statement would probably be a
<br>
result if the speaker felt defensive about the concepts and felt that a
<br>
possible way was to use deprecatory words.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt;As Barbara Lamar instantly commented while watching the show, women have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;not been noticeably averse to watching movies or using the telephone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Indeed, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it's hard to see why women should reject an immersive extension of such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;mediated experiences, one that enhances and enriches both the sensory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;bandwidth and the imaginative possibilities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If VR fulfills its promise for communication then I think women will use it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar to how the telephone is used. If anybody else here visits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multi-user virtual worlds they will have noticed the high proportion (about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 50:50) of women there already.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Many people use the phone every day, as they have for hundred of years.
<br>
<p>I went to some of them, the community chat rooms or multi-user virtual worlds,
<br>
they have good technology for those.  Those are about community and not
<br>
competition.  It is like talking on the phone, which in a serious way, is like
<br>
being there in person.
<br>
<p>In a way, I think it's about programming VCRs.  Also, it's about whether to use
<br>
a VCR if not watching or viewing tapes.  For example, people have cameras, they
<br>
are mostly the electronic and digital cameras, they can record to tape.
<br>
<p>I think there is also a large concept of telepresence.  For example, playing
<br>
card games or other games with other people using the computer terminal is like
<br>
having an automatic shuffler.  I play some military games with the other people
<br>
who play them, but only three or four games.  For example, over the years, they
<br>
have had many varieties of the types of perspective in the games.  I think it's
<br>
really interesting to imagine gameplay.  I think the best part is that they are
<br>
so friendly.  Basically, the players have a preference to win the game.  In
<br>
some of the games, they actually track who plays, and that way people can play
<br>
against many skill levels, with the team and competitive play.  People have a
<br>
rational separation between the games and reality.  The games are part of the
<br>
reality.  I practiced at the same game, and have a good record, so I play good
<br>
people who are well-skilled, as thousands of people play at a time.  They have
<br>
rankings for everybody who plays the game, I play the guys in the hundreds and
<br>
two hundreds.  That is for playing several times a day.  I am probably one of
<br>
the older people that play the game.
<br>
<p>In terms of telepresence, the players are actively participating in the outcome
<br>
of the game.  Depending on their level of seriousness about a game, they will
<br>
play for hours.  For example, I will play for hours to use a strategy to win
<br>
the game.  It's like other forms of competition.
<br>
<p>The games, there is the first person, then the third person perspectives on
<br>
them.  So, I am thinking about the second person, and think that basically that
<br>
the second person perspective is the other part of the first or third person
<br>
perspective.
<br>
<p>Sometimes, I think recordings of the games would be entertaining if I wanted to
<br>
watch an action movie.  The fantastic single-player scenerios have great
<br>
rewards.  Then, there is the complete &quot;persistent game&quot; realm, where the point
<br>
of the games are interaction.
<br>
<p>Then, there is the different consideration of the communications that are not
<br>
games.  For example, there are not so many of the coffee machines accessible
<br>
from the game.  Basically that is the difference between a fax machine and a
<br>
Sega.
<br>
<p>So, it's good that there are standards.  Many of the games are
<br>
developer-friendly, that way, people can make their own game scenarios.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Um, that last sentence sounds rather stuffy and abstract--guess I'm just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;one of those damned boyzzz after all... :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not a bit of it. :-D
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have had a high regard for your writing for a very long time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are anything but stuffy!

<p>I have written to Miriam before, we took part in some of the Internet community
<br>
VRML activities.  Also, they interact with the science fiction community in
<br>
Australia, I've heard about that.
<br>
<p>I have subscribed to this list, &quot;Extropians&quot;, for a couple years.  Oftentimes,
<br>
they'll have recent news of advances in science and technology.  They talk
<br>
about some current events, mostly future oriented current events, also, there
<br>
is various discussion, and talk about &quot;Extropians.&quot;  I was interested largely
<br>
for talk of exotic superweapons, for example as they have on other newsgroups
<br>
about &quot;science fiction&quot; and &quot;science fiction&quot; technology.  Then there is talk
<br>
about human rights.  The Extropians seem to have progressive attitudes about
<br>
making better the quality of life using technology.  Also, the readers are very
<br>
intelligent themselves, so people post entertaining thoughts, to the community
<br>
environment.
<br>
<p>The high technology aspects I think are really great.  The point is to make
<br>
them great quality of life aspects.  They readily are.
<br>
<p>For a year of posts for this mailing list, there are about twenty thousand
<br>
posts.  I have read thousands of them.  Anyone could have heard about
<br>
Extropians, for it was in the Wired magazine, as it has interesting features
<br>
that would be expected, that was years ago.  I started reading it a couple
<br>
years later, &quot;Extropians&quot;, where so I post sometimes for what I read.
<br>
<p>So today, if you get the equipment, the e-mail from the list can go anywhere on
<br>
the surface of the planet, except where the e-mail devices are not allowed.
<br>
The 3D virtual community is everywhere, many people play the 3D computer video
<br>
games.  There are many hundreds of thousands of active games.  In that way, the
<br>
measures of the populations are many and varied.
<br>
<p>Time for coffee!
<br>
<p>Have a nice day!
