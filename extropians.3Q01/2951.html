<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Kock did a study in which he compared twenty groups performing complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; tasks--ten groups interacting by face-to-face, and the other ten via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; e-mail. The study indicates that the amount of time cognitive effort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; (measured as &quot;time&quot;) required to convey a certain number of ideas via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; email is between 5 and 15 times than required to convey the same ideas in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; face-to-face conversation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It depends on the task.  It's not that infrequent that I see people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;agree to take a face-to-face discussion to e-mail.  The thought of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;orating a diff is absurd.
</em><br>
<p>I hate to sound stupid, but what's a diff?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;As usual, choose the right tool for the right task.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I couldn't agree more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Very true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are definitely situations where I prefer to carry on discussions by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; email. For example discussing with a client what changes they want in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program or a virtual world that I am working on for them -- I always try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encourage that it take place via email as my memory for face-to-face verbal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication is terrible. Email gives me a list of points to refer to later.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I often prefer email with my clients. When a client wants to tell me amounts 
<br>
(I do bookkeeping and income tax preparation), I ask them to please send 
<br>
me email. I don't want to transpose the figures that I hear on the phone.
<br>
<p>I find that the majority of clients are more concise and think more carefully 
<br>
about their answers when it isn't a face-to-face situation.  ;)
<br>
<p>Ciao,
