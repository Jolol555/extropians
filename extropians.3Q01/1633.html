<p>Well, I'd have thought it had *some* bearing on whether those maxims have

any relevance in a given situation. Perhaps it doesn't matter *how* a mad

might perhaps be unmodified by learning that A is A and that a penny saved

is a penny earned.

</em><br>
<p>The key factor to consider right now is that the `long run' is about to run
<br>
out.
<br>
<p>Making provision in the old-fashioned way might be as salient to preparing
<br>
for the Spike as polishing your brand-new car during the build-up to a
<br>
spasm nuclear war.
<br>
<p>Of course, it's possible that if the singularity takes a comparatively slow
<br>
ramp up to an unforeseeable transcendence, it'd make sense to sock away a
<br>
lot of money now in order to buy incremental improvements--life extension
<br>
drugs and surgery, like that. But hey, if money's all you need, I'm sure
<br>
plenty of crack merchants will be there waving their plastic cards. Of
<br>
course, they're also industrious and provident, after their fashion (`think
<br>
of it as evolution in action').
<br>
<p>But the socially redemptive virtues you invoke only deserve to be installed
<br>
and maintained if the world keeps kicking over in the same old way. And we
<br>
here on this list have agreed, pretty much (haven't we?), that this sure
<br>
isn't too likely. 
<br>
<p>Aside: In THE SPIKE I advocate measures such as guaranteed income, funded
<br>
from taxes, as a stop-gap to alleviate the worst effects of patchy poverty
<br>
caused, in many cases, by a specific family history of prejudice, neglect
<br>
or cultural deracination, and also to help salvage those flung out of work
<br>
due to the acceleration of technological innovations. Maybe we'll need such
<br>
measures increasingly during the next 20 or 30 or even 50 years (Eliezer,
<br>
ever the optimist, thinks we'll have real AI inside 10 years). I don't
<br>
think they'll destroy too many incentives in that time, at least not as
<br>
many as they might encourage. The idea, after all, isn't to make every poor
<br>
person a millionaire, just to make certain that they're modestly housed,
<br>
clothed and fed. And if they spend  their small pittance on booze and drugs
<br>
and big screen TV sets? I dunno, line 'em up against the wall and shoot
<br>
'em? (For future readers of the archives: that was just a tasteless joke,
<br>
not a policy recommendation.)
<br>
<p>That diversion aside, I repeat: Making provision in the old-fashioned way,
<br>
and inculcating the personal values appropriate to the frontier or the
<br>
1930s or 1950s, looks totally pointless in a world we expect to see
<br>
transformed exponentially during the immediate decades ahead.
