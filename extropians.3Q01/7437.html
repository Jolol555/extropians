It's extremist. It's a cartoon. And I see no reason not to require everyone to
<br>
load frangible or not board. At the moment, LEOs can load whatever they want.
<br>
The data is still out on exactly what credentials the bad guys carried.
<br>
Credentials can be faked, as we all know.
<br>
<p>Seriously, defensive use of any firearm on board an aircraft is a calculated
<br>
risk, and doing it right requires a _lot_ of training and practice. Head shots
<br>
down the length of a stretch DC-9? Nein danke. Twenty-way crossfire? Absolutely 
<br>
not!
<br>
<p>However, if the current word of FAA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking _removing_
<br>
the existing &quot;loophole&quot; for _flight crews_ to qualify and carry is true, this
<br>
sort of propaganda has its place, I think.
<br>
<p>I'll take flames and further comments off list.
