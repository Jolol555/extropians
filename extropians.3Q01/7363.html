</em><br>
<p>I didn't say anything about proselytizing.  Do you think in order to simply
<br>
become more visible in our society (a basic right) - that that would take
<br>
proselytizing?  Do you think in refusing to accept a kind of second-class
<br>
citizenship (which seems to have been accorded to nontheists) - that that
<br>
would take proselytizing?  Why do nontheists need to proselytize at all -
<br>
simply to &quot;be?&quot;  The percentage of Jews in the United States is something
<br>
like 3%, and it is safe to assume that most Americans who are not Jewish at
<br>
least know that Judaism exists.  Yet, compare that to the percentage of
<br>
nontheists (anywhere from 5% to 10% of the population, which is tens of
<br>
millions of people, i.e., not exactly a tiny minority) - who are essentially
<br>
invisible to the general population.  What accounts for this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Olga, we're just on different spots on the nontheism circle,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I see it.
</em><br>
<p>Okay.
<br>
<p>I might be able to get under some folk's radar.
<br>
<em>&gt; I favor sheaves of strategies, and I'm happy with there being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diversity of nontheism. :)
</em><br>
<p>The knowledge of this diversity of nontheism is only among nontheists, I'm
<br>
afraid.  The general population is hardly aware there are nontheists, or
<br>
else they think it's a type of coming-of-age rebellion some people go
<br>
through (kind of like C.S. Lewis' oft-cited temporary fall from grace which,
<br>
as it turned out, was a necessary step in his development as a mature
<br>
Christian, you know - atheism?  whyyyyyyyy, &quot;been there, done that,&quot; and
<br>
it's helped me to come back to and really, REALLY understand God).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Did you ever see the movie _Dogma_? Did you enjoy it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would you believe that Kevin Smith, the auteur, claims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to still be a practicing Catholic?
</em><br>
<p>No, didn't see the movie.  So far, what I learned about it didn't inspire me
<br>
to go out and get the CD.  Maybe I'll see it someday, though.
<br>
