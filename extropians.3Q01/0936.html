</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;My apologies to Mike, Brian and others whose hackles I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;raised, I have reread my first post and confess that it was rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;badly written and over the top.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;My points are not an attack on the American people or their way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life.
</em><br>
<p>Accepted, consider yourself Un-Plonked. ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;True, America does have far more in the way of rights for its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;citizens than any European country.  The difference arises in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;practice, during the McCarthy Era for instance, it didn't matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that you had a right to silence, several left-aligned playwrights
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and actors were ruined by the McCarthy trial simply because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stuck to their right to silence, and they were punished for it. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And as for thinking that the NSA really doesn't spy on American
</em><br>
<em>&gt;citizens, doesn't that seem a little strange when you consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt;programs such as Echelon (which does operate in Europe AND
</em><br>
<em>&gt;America).
</em><br>
<p>I suggest you read James Bamford's books on the NSA to get
<br>
perspective on this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;True, the US hasn't initiated any conflicts, but the US put an era
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in fear during the cold war (both America and the USSR were to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blame, not just the USSR).  The USA remains the only country to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;use a weapon of mass destruction on a civilian target (I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sure if you are the only nation to use weapons of mass destruction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on military targets either) for the bombing of Nagasaki and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hiroshima. 
</em><br>
<p>The cold war was the unfortunate result of the aftermath of WWII,
<br>
We were right to oppose totalitarianism disguised as communism.
<br>
<p>As to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Hiroshima was the embarkation point
<br>
for the southern Japanese fleet, and just upriver from Nagasaki was
<br>
where the torpedoes used at Pearl Harbor were made. There are also
<br>
allegations of chemical weapons factories if I recall. So much for
<br>
them being civilian targets. 
<br>
<p>By the way, both the notion of civilian targets and weapons of mass
<br>
destruction are modern ideas and terms, back then the atomic bomb
<br>
was seen as a new bomb, a superbomb sure, but not something that
<br>
had it's own class.
<br>
<p>The fire bombing raids killed far more than both of those bombs by
<br>
the way. I suggest reading Richard Rhodes books for perspective on
<br>
all this.
<br>
<p>As I used to tell people:
<br>
<p>What was released at Hiroshima and again at Nagasaki were the souls
<br>
of the men aboard the Arizona.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;And as for confiscating the rights of the accused in nationalistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hysteria, how about the McCarthy Era.  Also seeing as most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;situations you have mentioned occurred in western Europe quite a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;few hundred years ago (certainly in Britain) then I feel compelled
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to mention the slaughter of the native American people by the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government (such as the trail of tears), the confiscation of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;land and repression of their culture.
</em><br>
<p>You forgot slavery. No, clearly our forbearers are not without sin,
<br>
but neither are we. It's important we do better, that's what this
<br>
list is about.
<br>
<p>Of course Britain has it's share, and it's still going on (Northern
<br>
Ireland). Lets talk India... 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Are you saying that you deny the effect of movies, TV programs and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;books in influencing common belief about history.  These films
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seep into public opinion, Pearl Harbor is probably too extreme a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;case and I admit it was a bad choice to quote.  Unfortunately the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;average idiot is unlikely to regard these movies with a critical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mind but rather just watch it, if said average idiot hasn't had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particularly good history education, then where does he draw his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge about history from.  I'm not saying that a guy watches
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pearl Harbor and says &quot;my god, we won&quot; but to deny the effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;movies have on public opinion is dangerous.
</em><br>
<p>The recent movie &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; was bad, but not as bad as your
<br>
interpretation of D-Day.
<br>
<p>I agree with you that such movies have bad effects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Hey! I'm no Socialist, Anyway good for him.  But you must admit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Star Wars program is a bit mental (apparently it's going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the most expensive project ever undertaken by Man), and my points
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about the Kyoto talks (Clinton partly to blame here as well) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Chemical weapons talks (the name escapes me) still stand.
</em><br>
<p>In a world with rogue countries armed with intercontinental
<br>
ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads, a missile defense program
<br>
sounds like a pretty good idea.
<br>
<p>As for Kyoto, that was herr Klintons idea, actually more Gore's
<br>
idea, and a bad one. Since it did not enjoy the support of the
<br>
American people who's opinion was never even consulted, it was
<br>
rejected. There's a lesson there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I agree with Lee Corbin on almost all of his points, it was lack
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of thought that messed up my message, I have nothing against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;patriotism and national pride, and I really can't see how any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other nation could become as large and as powerful as the States
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without doing a better job, some would do just as well, some would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do far, far worse. My point was more that most nations would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;refuse to join the United States in any but the most extreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conditions.  While I fixated on Europe's attitude to America, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ignored our attitude to ourselves, national pride AND good old
</em><br>
<em>&gt;English Xenophobia is what is keeping England out of Europe and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maybe at a later date, out of the USA
</em><br>
<p>A federation of aligned countries is a good idea, I'm not
<br>
interested in more than that, I'm a pluralist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also I'm not envious of the States at all, I dislike all nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equally and without prejudice (even my own) :)
</em><br>
<p>We'll see.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I agree with J.R.'s idea.  The Chinese are certainly the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other nation I can think off that can be considered a superpower
</em><br>
<em>&gt;now.  Russia has all gone to hell but the chinese have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beavering away quietly(ish).  They have the worlds largest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;population, a huge army, and communism seems to work alot better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there than it did in Russia, maybe because of the cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;background.  Should be interesting to see what they get up to in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the next 20 odd years.
</em><br>
<p>To be a superpower you have to have world reach, something China
<br>
does not yet have. However I think China has every intention of
<br>
becoming one, and with it's current regime I don't see this as a
<br>
good thing.
