<em>&gt; I've got an even better idea!  We all know that education is the key.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We should forthwith open up in every city in America a number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; places where people can come in and read almost any book for FREE.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not only that, but after proper licensing, they might take any of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the materials home, and study to their hearts' content.  While perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it wouldn't be appropriate to fund this at the national level, I very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much favor local municipalities getting behind this idea.
</em><br>
<p>Why is this a better idea than being able to read and study
<br>
anything you want, whenever you want, from the convenience of
<br>
your own home?  All it would take is some sufficient room in the
<br>
IP wars and a just a bit more cheap and ubiquitous hardware.  We
<br>
are almost there now.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; One thing to remember though, even having all this knowledge online, or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; offering free classes may not be enough.  As discussed here earlier, some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people just do not have the intellectual power to do &quot;top ten list&quot; jobs in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information age.  Which is not to say they could at least fulfill whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; limited potential they have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Education is all that the under class needs!  If each person were to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take full advantage of what would be available under my proposal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poverty and ignorance would be greatly reduced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I disagree that education is all that is needed, unfortunately. 
<br>
I am not sure about the malleability of adult brains and the
<br>
general equality of brains as far as general intelligence goes
<br>
doesn't seem to exist.  SO how can education be all that is
<br>
needed?
