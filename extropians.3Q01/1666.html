<em>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Are you trying to tell me with a straight face that there is no way to know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt;&gt;where a satellite in a stable orbit will be in one hour's time?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Not enough to hit it with a bag of nuts without an active tracking and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;maneuvering system installed that doesn't deploy the nuts until its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;within a few miles of the target.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The orbiting moon is a long way away so we only know approximately where it is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the error is about a inch and a half. Your space battleship would be a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; closer so we could do a little better, making it about as useful in a modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war as a sea battleship, the USS Sitting Duck. If you know where something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is you can destroy it, no exceptions.
</em><br>
<p>Scale, John, Scale. An SBL is how long? 60 feet? 15 foot diameter with
<br>
two 15x45 solar panels. At a range of 10,000 miles, you need an accuracy
<br>
measured in tiny infinitesimal fractions of seconds of arc, while the
<br>
accuracy you need to hit the moon is in many whole minutes of arc
<br>
accuracy. Oh, and the moon can't maneuver, either... the SBL can. Oh,
<br>
and its easy to make in course corrections with primitive sigting
<br>
systems when steering for the moon, not so to hit a small SBL target,
<br>
you need accurate data piped up from ground stations.... 
<br>
<p>Essentially, in order to have a system that eliminates the SBL system,
<br>
you basically need your own SDI capability as well. If you have your own
<br>
SDI system, then you are not suffering a strategic disadvantage against
<br>
the US, you are in the same position you would be if neither side had an
<br>
SDI system, so there is no incentive to engage in such systems unless
<br>
you already are a significant player in ICBM technology. Rogue states
<br>
need not apply.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      &gt; A cone balloon in  free fall will without guidance not remain oriented
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      &gt;toward reentry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And a warhead in free fall will not need to be oriented toward reentry until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seconds before it hits the atmosphere.
</em><br>
<p>Then why are they all so oriented?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;a balloon will have a different mass, and therefore will follow a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;trajectory than the much heavier IRV.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A different trajectory? Research has shown that is not true, it was done a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years ago by a fellow named Galileo.
</em><br>
<p>Apparently you are not aware of orbital mechanics. Trajectory is
<br>
dependent upon the mass ratio between the two bodies orbiting each
<br>
other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; the round object is a poor reentry vehicle [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BALLOON! I said balloon. Put the cone shaped warhead in a aluminum coated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mylar balloon like the sort kids have at birthday parties. Obviously a balloon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would disintegrate the instant it hits the atmosphere and I'm surprised I even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to spell this out.
</em><br>
<p>Because the explosive shock of the balloon material erupting like that
<br>
would likely cause damage to the IRV unless it is further reinforced.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;You said it was orbiting opposite that of the SBLs, thus a retrograde
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;(east to west) orbit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What?
</em><br>
<p>John, don't you remember what you posted last? You said to throw some
<br>
nuts in the reverse direction of the SBL. That implies a retrograde
<br>
orbit...
