<br>
<p><em>&gt; Heres how we work this: set up a pool that anyone can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribute whatever amount they want.  Then at the end of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the month we distribute it evenly among all who want a share
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this guaranteed income.
</em><br>
<p>Brilliant!  None of the charities are doing this;
<br>
and it would play a wonderful role in getting
<br>
everyone to think about the advantages and
<br>
disadvantages of true charity.  You really ought
<br>
to have some smart cookies with a lot of experience
<br>
in charge, so that they can dish out the goodies
<br>
proportionally over the year, to even out the 
<br>
fluctuations (the contributions could fall off after
<br>
the initial surge).  Of course, all proceeds would
<br>
be public, perhaps announced as often as the DOW
<br>
averages are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note the guarantee only applies to the share,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the actual amount.  How much do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose that amount would be?  spike
</em><br>
<p>My guess is that you could get most of America's
<br>
workers to sign up for ten dollars a month.  And
<br>
since workers outnumber recipients about, what?,
<br>
say three to one, then that would be only about
<br>
thirty dollars a month.  Not much for people with
<br>
rent to pay, but the homeless would sure appreciate
<br>
it, and I'm sure that we could get their ranks to
<br>
swell a bit.
<br>
<p>How much do you think the amount might be?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You play [chess]?  Cool, we should do some email
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chess.  Cool, where were you at E5?  Have an rating?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I meant in chess, not in carousing.  {8^D
</em><br>
<p>I played in tournaments from about age 15 through
<br>
age 40, and got up to 2280 at one point; when
<br>
I stopped, about ten years ago, I was 2207.  I am
<br>
afraid that I am all &quot;chess-ed out&quot;, although it
<br>
sure would be fun to watch you play another extropian
<br>
some time!  My god, I even found that five-minute is
<br>
boring now (!!!) --- that just shows what can happen
<br>
when you spend too many decades doing the same thing,
<br>
I suppose;
<br>
or maybe it shows that my interests drifted, I am
<br>
not sure.  Are you able to play much?  Ever go to
<br>
chess clubs (there is a great Campbell club in our
<br>
area)?  Rated?  Did you get any games in at Extro-5?
<br>
(I couldn't make it :-( )
