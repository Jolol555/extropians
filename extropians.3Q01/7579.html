<p>
For a while, early in the AIDS crisis, some doctors were recommending HIV+
<br>
persons get a smallpox vaccination to activate the immune system to better
<br>
fight off the HIV virus. So there must be stock plies of the vaccine still
<br>
available.
<br>
<p>Recently ACTH has been unavailable. And several other medications. Rumors
<br>
said all available stocks were being diverted to military use, were held up
<br>
by paper work problems, were no longer available in the US because older
<br>
medications were not economic to manufacture and pass regulations, etc.
<br>
Makes you wonder if your doctor can really make the best medical decision
<br>
for you.
<br>
<p>I wonder how much you would have to howl to get access to proper medications
<br>
or if they were available from other countries.
<br>
