I may be behind on other replies, but I can't help but
<br>
comment on 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From: Miriam English
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sent: Friday, July 20, 2001 10:59 PM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; We all have sympathy for the downtrodden.  But some of us are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; more likely to give into temptation, in defiance of the memes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that I was talking about, and reward irresponsibility or lack
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of foresight, more than others of us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, of course, how silly of me! And here I thought it was to do with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colonisation and rape of lands, accidents of geography, desertification, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aftermath of wars, and so on that caused third world countries to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underdeveloped.
</em><br>
<p>My goodness!  What caused such an outburst?  I was speaking of social
<br>
charity, of governments providing a safety net and so on.  Go back
<br>
and see the context (July 20, sent 4:14 PM) of my original letter.
<br>
<p>Oh well, I will quote it for you.  Miriam had said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The main problem remaining is social justice: how to ensure that a child 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; born to parents who didn't want and couldn't afford children would not be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; condemned to second-class citizenry for their parents' mistake, or that a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; genius with a genetic disease would not be cast out of the medical system 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; as uninsurable. This wastes very important resources.
</em><br>
<p>What has this to do with coloization or rape of lands?  My original
<br>
remarks are clearly aimed at this!  I really was talking about
<br>
social justice, and the understandable urge we all have to do
<br>
something to ensure it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now I see it all! It is because all the poor and inhabitants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of poor countries are lazy, stupid, lying scum!
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that at all!  I protest!  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Wow Lee, have you thought of running for president?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If not of the USA, at least the nazi party.  :-)
</em><br>
<p>MIriam,  I am really very, very sorry that something about
<br>
my writing style has caused this to happen.  (You are not the
<br>
first.)  When I look at my paragraph above, it all seems so 
<br>
innocent and harmless, &quot;some of us are more likely to give
<br>
into temptation and reward irresponsibility than others of
<br>
us&quot;.
<br>
<p>How did poor countries get into it?  Why do I remind you of nazis?
<br>
<p>Thanks, and really sorry for whatever it was I said that caused this,
<br>
<p>Lee
