<p>Almost all U.S. residents profit from the general prosperity, even people
<br>
who eat from dumpsters. Dumpsters are not nearly so rich in edible and
<br>
useful stuff in poorer countries.

<p>This is true, but it's also true that some blacks in the U.S. are much
<br>
better of than some whites, and not necessarily through their own efforts.
<br>
There are blacks who were loved by their parents, wore nice clothes and went
<br>
to good schools, and there are whites who were beaten by their parents,
<br>
dressed in rags and quit school after the third grade.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  maybe you can feel some compassion for a

<p><em>&gt;... a sadness for many blacks which is still cruelly real

</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and we can afford to say &quot;thank you,&quot; and &quot;we're sorry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for what was done to you,&quot; and acknowledge the contributions made by
</em><br>
slaves.
<br>
<p>True; but perhaps there's some other way to do it than affirmative action,
<br>
which penalizes individual whites and often fails to help those blacks who
<br>
need help the most. When you turn down a young woman whose dream was to go
<br>
to medical school because she's a white, so that you can admit a black with
<br>
fewer qualifications, you're making that one young white person pay a
<br>
greatly disproportionate price. For all we know, maybe the white woman was
<br>
the daughter of poor parents; maybe she worked nights to pay her way through
<br>
college. And maybe the black woman who gets into medical school instead had
<br>
rich parents and went to the best private schools their money could get her
<br>
into. The blacks I've known who benefited the most from affirmative action
<br>
were from middle class backgrounds. In some cases, rich whites were the
<br>
ultimate beneficiaries, such as when whites set up businesses with black
<br>
&quot;owners&quot; so the businesses would be have special status for getting
<br>
government contracts and so forth. I know this from personal observation.
<br>
And if I observed this sort of thing happening as often as I did, I'm sure
<br>
it must have been extremely common.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It would be fine if the collective &quot;we&quot; could make reparations for every
<br>
injustice ever suffered under unjust laws. But I think it could never be
<br>
good if we make lone individuals pay the price to assuage the guilt for the
<br>
rest of us.
