</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;A family of relatively recent Indian immigrants who are merchants
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in our neighbrohood have a 10-year-old son who seems to be shaping 
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
<br>
Neighbrohood? ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;up to be a math and science prodigy.  He came in 5th place last
</em><br>
<em>&gt;year in the state math competition and his development in these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;areas appears to be accelerating under the enthusiastic support of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his proud parents and teachers.  His father confided in me this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;afternoon, though, that the boy is lagging in his reading skills:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He's bored with what he's given to read at school and, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his parents are very fine people, they have only a modest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education and are at a loss for what to suggest he read.  When I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proposed that we might try to interest him in some science
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fiction, his father's eyes lit up and he responded that it was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;splendid&quot; idea.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Here's the only problem: I don't know what to suggest for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;super-bright 10-year-old in 2001.  I was cutting my teeth on RAH's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and Bradbury's (the other one)juveniles at that time and fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quickly graduated to His Most Blessed Insightfulness, the Serene
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Maestro of Serendip.  What's good these days?
</em><br>
<p>Since Heinlein and &quot;Snow Crash&quot; &quot;Enders Game&quot; are already
<br>
recommended I'll add &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; and &quot;The Foundation
<br>
Trilogy&quot;. Don't forget hard science books as well. There is a very
<br>
interesting book about an Indian math prodigy the title of which
<br>
escapes me now. &quot;Godel, Escher Bach, an Eternal golden braid&quot; would
<br>
also be good.
<br>
<p>Ever since I was little I've tested way above the norm for reading.
<br>
I had a very bright teacher just out of school who used to share
<br>
her college science texts with me in 4th grade. When I was in 7th
<br>
grade I tested as 14.2 (as in second year of college) which was
<br>
originally thought to be in error, then was confirmed by a second
<br>
carefully administered test. As I result I spent alot of time being
<br>
asked questions by a room full of people in suits.
<br>
<p>My point is that I have my own opinions on how to create a great
<br>
reader, and it's very simple.
<br>
<p>Give them access to LOTS of interesting material, especially
<br>
material that is way over their heads, they will pick and choose to
<br>
their own levels. Even parts of complicated books can be understood
<br>
leading to that drive to understand it all. The biggest dictionary
<br>
you can afford is also essential.
<br>
<p>You might want to consider giving us a snail-mail address to send
<br>
books to, I can't imagine anything more exciting to a young reader
<br>
than to receive lots of interesting books from people he's never
<br>
even met.
<br>
<p>You could act as intermediary.
