<p>
I am afraid that the Koran, Bible, Torah &amp;c. are wholly unreliable
<br>
sources, and those humans who regurgitate supernaturalist
<br>
nonsense from such sources are just not intellectually respectable.
<br>
<p>This archaic, divisive, delusional consciousness needs to be purged
<br>
from the planet as soon as possible. Median Vision Theory refutes
<br>
all supernaturalist beliefs utterly. But just common-sense is all
<br>
you need to reject all religious beliefs and with them the other false
<br>
layers of belief and language that have corrupted human-era philosophy.
<br>
<p>I have decided, as a step against brainwashing and dissemination of lies,
<br>
to release all my early Phantom Eye/ Primal Eye/ Median Vision Theory
<br>
texts to the public domain to be freely distributed by whoever wants to
<br>
reproduce them.
<br>
<p>I am also considering putting on hold various patents pending on
<br>
applications
<br>
of Median Vision Theory &amp; entering into agreements with other parties to
<br>
share
<br>
costs and benefits of MVT developments (Reverse Hypnosis, Conscious
<br>
Machines).
<br>
<p>MVT is now taught in some UK Philosophy departments, as well as the
<br>
CD being on Philosophy A-Level reading lists. Philosophy CDROM will also
<br>
be distributed at a COST-PRICE discount to all schoolkids and students who
<br>
want it.
<br>
Islam according to the Koran will supposedly win the &quot;war&quot; against all other
<br>
religions. But truth and evolutionary science will triumph over all
<br>
religions .....

<em>&gt; Text to follow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The first thing to do when trying to understand 'Islamic suicide bombers'
</em><br>
is to forget the clichés about the Muslim taste for martyrdom. It does
<br>
exist, of course, but the desire for paradise is not a safe guide to what
<br>
motivated the appalling suicide attacks on New York and Washington last
<br>
week. Throughout history, political extremists of all faiths have willingly
<br>
given up their lives simply in the belief that by doing so, whether in
<br>
bombings or in other forms of terror, they would change the course of
<br>
history, or at least win an advantage for their cause. Tamils are not
<br>
Muslims, but they blow themselves up in their war on the government of Sri
<br>
Lanka; Japanese kamikaze pilots in the second world war were not Muslims,
<br>
but they flew their fighters into US aircraft carriers.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Islamofascist ideology of Osama bin Laden and those closest to him,
</em><br>
such as the Egyptian and Algerian 'Islamic Groups', is no more intrinsically
<br>
linked to Islam or Islamic civilisation than Pearl Harbor was to Buddhism,
<br>
or Ulster terrorists - whatever they may profess - are to Christianity.
<br>
Serious Christians don't go around killing and maiming the innocent; devout
<br>
Muslims do not prepare for paradise by hanging out in strip bars and getting
<br>
drunk, as one of last week's terrorist pilots was reported to have done.
