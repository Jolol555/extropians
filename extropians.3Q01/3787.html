<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; And who does the exit polling? The media, which has a proven bias. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; fact is that exit pollsters have to correct exit poll data because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; pollsters ALWAYS project more votes for democrats than what actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; occurs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You are absolutely right.  But the margin is small.  The fact that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ALWAYS do it makes it totally consistent and repeatable, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is why they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are capable of correcting it as you noted above.  Their may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bias in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; methods, but they do fairly correct the data to present more accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; results.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but what about the impact? Most people know that their one vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will have little impact on an election either way. When the media report
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the democrats are winning by even a small margin, this discourages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; republicans from going and voting, expecting the election to be lost.
</em><br>
<p>But I don't think they report this.  Even you mentioned that they &quot;correct&quot;
<br>
for this bias.
<br>
<p>However, I agree with you that elections should not be predicted or polled
<br>
before the voting is done.  Even though I don't think it has been proven to
<br>
have interfered with the results, the potential is just too great.
<br>
Elections would be more objective and fair if the media did not try to call
<br>
them before they are finished.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's a nice neat way to let the media off the hook. I don't buy it. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have personally seen exit pollers ignore people with conservative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leanings and select people who look 'liberal' to participate in exit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polls, whether its done by hair length, clothing quality, or skin color
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is irrelevant, it is profile that is at least as wrong as the police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profiling of blacks that liberals complain of.
</em><br>
<p>I think you see conspiracies more often than I do.  Conspiracies are not the
<br>
simplest explanation for the observed data.  Mere stupidity, sloppiness,
<br>
confusion are often more likely explanations.  It is true that everyone has
<br>
biases, and biases skew results, and more liberals seem to become media
<br>
people, so the media has a liberal bias.  But I don't think any of this was
<br>
a deliberate plot by the Left.  It just evolved that way.  You give the Left
<br>
too much credit if you think they could have infiltrated and taken over
<br>
almost all media.
