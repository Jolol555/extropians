</em><br>
<p>You know... this one has always bugged me.  I used to
<br>
be a white male.
<br>
<p>I was married to a phillipino female.
<br>
<p>She was the major bread winner, I worked part time at
<br>
minimum wage jobs and took care of the house and kids.
<br>
<p>When the kids were all in school I went back to school
<br>
and got an AA in computer info systems.  
<br>
<p>I went to work for the same company (different
<br>
office)as my spouse, doing the same job she'd been
<br>
doing for 5 years(Network Admin) at a higher pay (with
<br>
no experience.)
<br>
<p>2 years later I was promoted over her to a regional
<br>
position.
<br>
<p>As a white male I heard about reverse discrimination,
<br>
but I never experienced it.  I heard about the
<br>
institutionalization of discrimination against white
<br>
males, but it had zero impact on my life.
<br>
<p>Instead, I enjoyed white male privilege... in every
<br>
social, school and work setting, I was automatically
<br>
accorded more respect than women or ethnic minorities
<br>
(even by the minorities themselves) simply because I
<br>
was a white male. 
<br>
<p>Years of affirmative action had zero impact on me.  I
<br>
suspect that no one on this list has been adversely
<br>
affected by affirmative action either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a purely theoretical point of view, affirmative
</em><br>
action is discrimination based on race... but from an
<br>
eminently practical one, it didn't do enough to level
<br>
the playing field.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From quality of education, through housing, legal and
</em><br>
employment issues, black americans are still routinely
<br>
handed the short end of the stick.
<br>
<p>Things have improved... and part of the reason they
<br>
have improved is programs like affirmative action.
<br>
<p>BTW...  I scored Libertarian on the worlds shortest
<br>
political quiz... the only question I didn't answer
<br>
yes was a &quot;maybe&quot; on the minimum wage question.
<br>
<p>Libertarian principles make sense to me... but only as
<br>
an ongoing system.
<br>
<p>How we get from here to there has never been
<br>
adequately addressed for me... and one of the major
<br>
problems that hasn't been addressed is racism.
<br>
