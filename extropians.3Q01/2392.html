Thank you; that was useful.  It does not address the fundamental
<br>
examination of land rights I am after but was informative anyway.
<br>
One of the reasons I am interested in examining land rights is to
<br>
analyze the legitimacy and stability of government claims.  It is
<br>
mostly claims on large unused tracts of land I find troublesome.
<br>
I also find the taking of land by force in the absence of torts or
<br>
necessity problematic.
<br>
<p>Governments can give people rights but governments only have
<br>
the rights people give them.  What someone takes or holds by force
<br>
alone is not a right.  Many of the things you labeled as government
<br>
rights may be more correctly called government claims or powers.
<br>
It may be that many people have given these rights to governments
<br>
but I haven't talked to enough people to find out what they do and
<br>
do not wish to allow government.
<br>
<p>Settlers have some right to control their environment and the U.S.
<br>
is certainly settled in some sense.  Beyond that I am trying to understand
<br>
the ethics involved, the customs, and the consequences of various
<br>
systems well enough to decide to what extent I want to collaborate
<br>
with the system.  Once you acknowledge land ownership or control
<br>
so many other things become a matter of cooperating or leaving.
<br>
<p>I certainly have no interest in fighting these systems in culturally
<br>
unaccepted ways but I don't know that I support them either.
<br>
I always have a healthy respect for large clubs but I think it is
<br>
a poor way to run a country unless the clubs are backed by
<br>
some very reasonable set of ethics.
<br>
<p>I'll stick a response to your comment on contracts being a good
<br>
thing here also.  Reasonable contracts seem like a great thing
<br>
to me but contracts are binding on the parties to the contract,
<br>
not other people.  John and Joan can contract to sell a stolen
<br>
Rolex but I'm not necessarily going to see their contract as
<br>
legitimate.

<em>&gt; &gt; This was actually discussed a bit when I was real estate classes a
</em><br>
couple
<br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; years ago. In the US it generally works like this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; First you have to define what is real property. Generally, land is meant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; refer to &quot;the earth's surface to the center of the earth and the
</em><br>
airspace
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; above the land, including trees and water. At one point these rights
</em><br>
were
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assumed to extend infinitely into space, but the courts generally won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allow you to charge American Airlines for flying eight miles above your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; house, as it doesn't seriously affect your right to use your property.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Estate includes the definition of land, and adds whatever man-made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may be on the land. Real Property includes all of the above, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;bundle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of legal rights&quot;. These are:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The right of possession -the right to physically possess and occupy the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The right to control the property within the limits of the law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The right of enjoyment-the right to use the property in any legal manner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The right of exclusion- the right to keep others off your property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The right of disposition- the right to sell, rent, lease, will, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dispose of the property in any way you see fit within the bounds of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As part of this you can sell darn near anything on, under, or above the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; property that is legal to sell, or the rights to anything that might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there (assuming you own those rights, but that's another issue).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now the government has some rights, too. There is police power, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power to enact legislation or take actions to preserve order, protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; health, etc. This usually comes out in building codes, environmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; legislation, and other laws that might affect real property. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; also has the right of eminent domain, which is the right of the
</em><br>
government
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to condemn your property and then use it build a new school, new
</em><br>
projects,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or (if you live in Tennessee) the road to your Governor's retirement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; property. Usually the government in question will give a reasonable
</em><br>
market
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; value as compensation for the property acquired in this manner. There is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; also the right of taxation, wherein the city or county government carve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a chunk of your salary each year rather than taking your land by the
</em><br>
inch.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The state can also have the right of escheat, where the government finds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; legal heirs to the property and claims the property for government use
</em><br>
or
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resale.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Most all of this has come down from English common law.
