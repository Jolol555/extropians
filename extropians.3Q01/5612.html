<br>
<em>&gt; Are you sure of that?
</em><br>
<p>Unless you can identify the product, yes, I'm sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There was an incident in 1999 when Bill Clinton nearly had to declare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal bankruptcy; why do you think he's treading the lecture circuit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so eagerly?
</em><br>
<p>Donald Trump and Al Capone were once close to bankruptcy. Crooks have their
<br>
ups and downs, I guess. That's show biz. I still say there's generally more
<br>
dead wood in government than in private industry, despite individual cases.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a general rule of thumb, government salaries are a pittance compared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to their private enterprise equivalents.
</em><br>
<p>Compared to what they actually accomplish, government bosses are more overpaid
<br>
than their private enterprise counterparts (the ones that _produce_ wealth).
<br>
<p>From: &quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20Fw:%20Back%20to%20Serfs%20and%20Royalty?&In-Reply-To=&lt;01e901c133bf$b1551d80$f35c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">bradbury@aeiveos.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Actually, in fact, I'm more than angry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm really incredibly f**king pissed off.
</em><br>
<p>LOL, that's good, Robert. Just remember, it's better to be pissed off than
<br>
pissed on.
<br>
While you're at it, why not piss on some worthless political party bosses.
<br>
(BTW, 8 X 400K = 2.4 million, so the president IS paid millions of dollars --
<br>
for no identifiable product.)
<br>
<p>So, what I said still stands:
<br>
If there is a problem, it's concentrated more in government (the PC ruling
<br>
class) than in private industry (the working class). Most overpaid bosses are
<br>
in government, starting with the US president, who is paid millions and is
<br>
responsible for no identifiable product.
<br>
Massive government layoffs = extropy.

<p>From: &quot;Spike Jones&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:spike66@attglobal.net?Subject=Re:%20Fw:%20Back%20to%20Serfs%20and%20Royalty?&In-Reply-To=&lt;01e901c133bf$b1551d80$f35c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">spike66@attglobal.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps we have identified the problem.  For a paltry few million US, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can hire a decent CEO.  Since the POTUS only gets 140k, we keep ending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up with these yahoos that no one would trust with an actual business.
</em><br>
<p>Very true. In the US we have the best government money can buy, so maybe we
<br>
should stop paying them under the table and make their bribes public.

<br>
<em>&gt; Bill Gates --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose company I detest -- has nevertheless done something I quite admire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recently; he's allocated a not-inconsiderable sum ($750M) to a public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health scheme in south-east
</em><br>
<p>He gave them stock in Microsoft equivalent to $750M (not cash). Big
<br>
difference, because it means the public health of south Asians is tied to the
<br>
future fate of Microsoft, thus giving south Asians reason to support Bill
<br>
Gates.
