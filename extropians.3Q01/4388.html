Anders Sandberg:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for pseudoscience and loose thinking, maybe one way handling it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be to set up an epistemic policy on the list. Such a policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would suggest proper standards for what claims could be posted and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how much empirical or scholarly backup is proper. For example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Posting of claims contradicting known or widely accepted physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomena must be backed up by at least one independent empirical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; study&quot;. While I do not think such an epistemic policy needs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involve punishments for disobeying it, the existence of an accepted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard of posting that could be invoked when someone makes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spurious claim would likely have some effect. Setting up the policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would by its nature be a fairly heated subject, but maybe it could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; managed by first allowing a smaller team to develop the core and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put it up for a debate, like we did with the Transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Declaration.
</em><br>
<p>This is a solid suggestion; I like it. List &quot;rules&quot; seem to work pretty well
<br>
even in very large lists with high churn rates. I have belonged to a number
<br>
of lists that kept a core of working rules (different in each case)
<br>
regarding message content that went a long way to keeping things managable
<br>
and the list in existance.
<br>
<p>As Anders says, punishment is not really necessary: a simple &quot;hey -- list
<br>
rules, please read [url]&quot; and general acceptance of the sensible nature of
<br>
the list rules works nearly all of the time. If humans have this innate
<br>
desire to conform and have rules, take advantage of it says I.
