</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously, this doesn't work in the US, which has a large indigenous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black population. But I noticed some interesting resonances in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; piece. Given that white anglo-saxon types are due to become a minority

</em><br>
<p>I don't think that it is a direct cause (racism), but it can certainly
<br>
become an effect of importing a bunch of uneducated unacculturated
<br>
people who don't speak the language and who have lived for generations
<br>
with serf mindsets, rather than citizen mindsets. Those who have grown
<br>
up in this culture but live at or near the bottom of the economic ladder
<br>
would like to improve their lives and that of their families. Importing
<br>
a bunch of people willing to do your work for 1/4th of what you need to
<br>
live would certainly breed resentment and hate in many people. The fact
<br>
that they may be visually distinctive from one's fellow citizens only
<br>
exacerbates the issue.
<br>
<p>I might point out that significant portions of our 'indigenous black'
<br>
population tends to be the most anti-immigrant, not the whites.
