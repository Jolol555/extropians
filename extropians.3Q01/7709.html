Samantha Atkins a écrit (29.9.2001/00:57) :
<br>
<em>&gt; I see no really good reason for a continuing large force in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saudi Arabia.  It doesn't provide significant enough detterrent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relative to our ability to quickly move in forces when necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the level of action present imho.  And it costs an arm and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leg financially as well as in good will of the people in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; region.  
</em><br>
<p><p>That may be.
<br>
<p>But what seems clear to me (and makes the previous point not very
<br>
important in the frame of this discussion) is that some of what you do
<br>
will keep provoking the rage of some islamists, even if you don't want
<br>
it, and don't understand why. For them to be &quot;ruled&quot; by you, in
<br>
whatever conceivable sense and indirect way, is just totally
<br>
unacceptable ; justice is that it be the other way around. The
<br>
infidels should be ruled by the faithfull, not the other way around.
<br>
<p>See for example Lewis' &quot;The Roots of Muslim Rage&quot;, already mentionned
<br>
here
<br>
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/90sep/rage.htm">http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/90sep/rage.htm</a>
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't see why it is the business of the US to practice world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domination nor do I see us really doing that.  If it is our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business then we should do it honestly imho and establish a true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one-world government and mono-culture.
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm not speaking of an actual domination, something that is concretely
<br>
present everywhere all the time, but a potential domination, that is,
<br>
checking at any given point in time that you can regain control, even
<br>
if at a cost.
<br>
<p>Why would you do that ? Well, simply because (and this answers
<br>
Damien's message, too) you don't trust other people to do it : that
<br>
would cause a threat on yourself and on the way of living that you
<br>
want to preserve. I think you are right in this, and that relativizing
<br>
your interests (or your sense of justice) is not something that makes
<br>
sense.
<br>
<p>Relativizing makes knowledge better ; but not value judgements. These
<br>
are relative to oneself, and SHOULD BE.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't dismiss it easily but I don't believe the fault is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself.
</em><br>
<p><p>Read sourate 9 (sorry I didn't find the English for sourate, that's a
<br>
&quot;chapter&quot;) of the Coran and tell me about it.
<br>
<p>I know of course that many muslims don't follow this blindly. But if
<br>
you take it as it is (not by some strange fanatic reading ; just as it
<br>
is), then you should fight against and kill all non-muslim, whithout
<br>
even thinking of your own life.
<br>
<p>I'm not an expert ; I read this yesterday for the first time. But I'm
<br>
not sure how &quot;kill all of them wherever they are&quot; (9:5, but repeated
<br>
throughout the chapter) can take a totally new meaning when one
<br>
becomes an expert.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  If you want terrorists and mad crusades look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christianity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about 500 years ago and some of the continuing extremism to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day. Yet there is no real support for such methods in the New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Testament.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think this is not a good argument. Atheists made slaughters, too, we
<br>
know that. It doesn't entail that some religious content cannot
<br>
sometimes provoke violent action. Sometimes the cause is not there ;
<br>
sometimes it may be. In this instance, the terrorists actions are
<br>
consistant with sourate 9. And if you listen to one of these people
<br>
(violent islamists), you discover that they are not vile nor mad, but
<br>
loyal and consistant with their beliefs.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; For example, in Christianism, force is not well regarded. It is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; islam. In Christianism, you should love even your ennemy. Not in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; islam.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not quite true.  Even your enemy should be treated with honor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and using respectable means.
</em><br>
<p><p>OK, you should kill him with honour.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure but this is not the point. France should not support US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; policies and actions on this blindly any more than Americans should.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Freedom includes the right to freely question and to disagree. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't make you or your country complicit in terrorism if you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; disagree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think this is not a yes/no problem. Imagine that your friend is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; badly hurt, and asks help from you to counter. Depending on the kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of help she asks, what really happened, what might happen next, who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the attacker, etc., you will have a tension between various desires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and fears. It's a matter of nuance and quantity, and to make the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; choice you need to limitate the amount of blindness and cowardness that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you put in the resolution of the problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where did cowardice entere into this?  How does any blindness at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all help?
</em><br>
<p><p>I was talking about France. What I meant is that refusing support to
<br>
the US is a decision in which cowardice (sorry for awkward English and
<br>
thanks for your patience) and blindness can play a role, not only the
<br>
legitimate auto-determination and own vision of things. Cowardice, to
<br>
avoid fighting of course, but more to avoid possible later retaliation
<br>
from terrorists ; blindness, to consider that this is a USA problem,
<br>
and we are not concerned by it.
<br>
<p>But I don't want to insist on this last point : first it is &quot;our
<br>
business&quot; ; second, I agree with what you said initially : that
<br>
proposing the alternative &quot;you support us blindly or you support the
<br>
terrorists&quot; would not be nice.
<br>
