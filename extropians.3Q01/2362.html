<p><em>&gt; But we'd be without the arrogance of whites &quot;granting&quot;

</em><br>
<p>I'm not certain I understand what you are getting at above.  I don't think
<br>
the arrogance of whites is what's important here - black people I know don't
<br>
give a fig about how whites perceive themselves ... they just want a place
<br>
at the table.  For hundreds of years whites have benefited from the UNPAID
<br>
labor of slaves (in the South and the North, in the latter by business
<br>
owners who profited from the work of southern slaves, even when they did not
<br>
live in slave states).  After hundreds of years of slavery, then another 100
<br>
years of legal segregation, to today's de facto bigotry - generations of
<br>
blacks have been affected.  While some blacks have done all right for
<br>
themselves, the playing field is far, far from level, and the successes are
<br>
disproportionately rare.
<br>
<p>Reiterating, whites in America have profited from hundreds of years of
<br>
UNPAID labor from blacks.  Many rich families in the United States (whose
<br>
businesses have benefited from slavery generations ago) are still profiting
<br>
from that &quot;slave labor&quot; ... interest earned, stocks, trusts, what have you.
<br>
Generation upon generation.  Where's the fairness in all this?  Affirmative
<br>
action is merely a pittance-solution.  I think blacks should get
<br>
reparations - not in the form of cash, but in the form of assistance to help
<br>
their kids get the best education they can, from an early age.  The average
<br>
5-year-old black kid today is way behind - at that age, already - to
<br>
privileges bestowed on the average 5-year-old white kid.  The help probably
<br>
needs  to start earlier than age 5.
<br>
<p>Remember - whites profited from UNPAID slave labor for hundreds of years.
<br>
When a tourist goes to visit the White House, it is rarely mentioned - if at
<br>
all - that it was built with unpaid slave labor.  How shameful - both this
<br>
historic fact, and the fact that not many people are aware of this.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Thomas Sowell documents in excruciating detail the horrible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results of affirmative action ...
</em><br>
<p>My guy also has some interesting stories to relate, also in excrutiating
<br>
detail.  Randall Robinson (whose brother was Max Robinson, the first black
<br>
anchor on TV back in the late 1970s-early 1980s), in his book &quot;Defending the
<br>
Spirit,&quot; tells of his daughter, Khalea (who tested as a gifted child and who
<br>
was doing very well at Beauvoir, a highly rated private school in
<br>
Washington, D.C.).  Khalea told her parents that only the other three other
<br>
black girls in her class were ever made to take &quot;time out&quot; (for disciplinary
<br>
reasons) - the white girls, never.  The other black girls were relatively
<br>
&quot;privileged,&quot; as was Khalea - one (an especially quiet girl) was the
<br>
daughter of a Time magazine columnist, another was the daugther of a judge
<br>
on the D.C. Superior Court, and the third girl's mother was on the governing
<br>
board of the Beauvoir School.  When the teacher was asked whether she
<br>
thought it was odd that only the black girls and none of the white girls
<br>
were ever made to take &quot;time out&quot; for discipline, the teacher's response was
<br>
that, no, she didn't think it was odd at all.  The teacher justified it, in
<br>
fact, by explaining that, &quot;Studies show that black parents rear their
<br>
children to be more aggressive.&quot;
<br>
<p>And this was in a special, privileged private school.  You'd think that
<br>
extra care would have been taken to treat children fairly and without
<br>
bigotry in such a school.   If Thomas Sowell says that racism doesn't exist
<br>
in the U.S., he's lying in the grunt (and I'm certain he gets paid very well
<br>
to tow that line, if that's what he says ...).  I have capitalized UNPAID up
<br>
there three times, I realize.  There seems to be so much concern about a
<br>
little tax money going to undeserving, lazy, good-for-nothin's among some of
<br>
you.  Can you imagine living for generations, working hard all your life for
<br>
the benefit of other people (who owned you, to top off the indignity), and
<br>
never being paid for your labor?  Then, and again - for generations -
<br>
suffering the indignities of living as &quot;untouchables&quot; in the South.  I would
<br>
have gone stir crazy.  All of us now - black and white - are all still
<br>
living with the legacy of those times.  That's what I think, anyway - that's
<br>
how I see it.
