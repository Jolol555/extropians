<em>&gt; &gt; Are there sound, scientific, a priori reasons for saying that there are no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; race differences in intelligence due to nature-genetics? What are they?
</em><br>
<p>While we get wrapped up in the debate of whether this group or
<br>
that group is smarter, we perhaps overlook the fact that aaaallll groups
<br>
of humans are faaaaarrr smarter than would be necessary for survival.
<br>
The interesting question is why.  I had an idea that is a slight variation
<br>
of those notions found in Geoffrey Miller's The Mating Mind.
<br>
<p>In that work, Miller suggests that humans became smart largely
<br>
because of mate selection, primarily from our choosing those mates
<br>
which could perform music and art, the human equivalent of the
<br>
peacock's tail.  But perhaps it works the other way around.
<br>
What if: early humans began to select mates that had a large head
<br>
with respect to their bodies, since that feature would make them more
<br>
resemble infants.  Or: big headed people were considered attractive
<br>
because they appeared juvenile.  Consider the phrases &quot;boyish
<br>
good looks&quot; and &quot;hey baby&quot; etc.
<br>
<p>So perhaps humans simply selected for big heads, not necessarily
<br>
smarts, therefore large brains were the result, not the driver.
<br>
Thence music, art, science, and all the rest followed from that
<br>
simple mechanism.  The result was that humans, like the peacocks,
<br>
have heavy and costly sexual ornamentation that if anything
<br>
detracts from individual survival.  Under that theory, any debate
<br>
about what subgroup of human is smartest loses all significance.
<br>
<p>Where AI fits into this picture is mysterious to me.  I suppose
<br>
after the singularity, we would need to see the rise of biological
<br>
intelligence as a form of preadaptation, analogous to when
<br>
protobirds developed feathers as a temperature regulation
<br>
mechanism.  Perhaps the feathers became larger by mate
<br>
selection until the day they were first used for flight, at which
<br>
time everything changed, a singularity of sorts.  spike
