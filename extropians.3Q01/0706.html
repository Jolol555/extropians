<p>
A good book which I am presently reading on exactly these topics is:
<br>
&quot;The
<br>
Book&quot; by Alan Watts.  In it, AW successfully explains the tricky myth of
<br>
the
<br>
Self and how one can change the idea of Self to view everything in a
<br>
more
<br>
integrated and holistic fashion.  This happens in the course of some
<br>
kinds
<br>
of meditation and spiritual practice.  Some would argue it is a
<br>
healthier or
<br>
more enlightened view.
<br>
<p>Like &quot;M. E. Smith&quot; who posted yesterday, I merely lurk here to sample
<br>
the
<br>
tasty morsels of good ideas.  A significant quantity of posts however,
<br>
exhibit a &quot;religiously&quot; anti-religious bias if you will, that squelches
<br>
or
<br>
discourages some enlightening discussion.  It is a curious phenomena
<br>
given
<br>
the transparently mythical and mystical ideas which seem to drive this
<br>
movement.
<br>
<p>In my observation, Extropianism, like Objectivism and other -isms, tends
<br>
to
<br>
draw a &quot;rational&quot; fanatical element that is more interested in finding
<br>
and
<br>
expounding the one true belief than actually growing or exploring new
<br>
ideas.
<br>
However, these people are the life blood of movements and without them,
<br>
we
<br>
might never come into contact with these new and interesting ideas.
<br>
Despite
<br>
or perhaps because of these tensions, this movement or at least this
<br>
list is
<br>
still very much alive.  So, thank you all!
<br>
