Very nice!
<br>
<p>I enjoyed it unreservedly. Nicely optimistic.
<br>
<p>While Reason may be right that many look down on science fiction, only a 
<br>
science fiction enthusiast would be very likely to know who Frank Herbert 
<br>
is. I would leave it in. I feel a little odd saying that, as I gotta say I 
<br>
love the way Reason writes.
<br>
<p>Good luck, and I hope you light stars in people's eyes,
<br>

<em>&gt;Awakening the Sleeper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;An anonymous Internet pundit once wrote, &quot;The world is so fast that there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are days when the person who says it can't be done is interrupted by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;person who is doing it.&quot; It doesn't take much looking around these days to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;see that world is changing on multiple fronts at breakneck speed. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Human Genome has been mapped. Computers are becoming more powerful, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;smaller, and omnipresent. On the societal front the change is no less 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dizzying. The nations of Europe have become the European Union. China has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;broken out of its formerly third-world status to become a real potential 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rival to the United States. We hear of protests and revolutions all over 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the world on what seems to be a daily basis. In the financial world we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;move from being in the longest sustained boom of the twentieth century to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the troubled market we now see each night on CNBC. The one constant of our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;times, it seems, is change. And frankly, more and greater changes are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;approaching than we could have formerly even conceived.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So how do we, as human beings living in the age of change, cope with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;constant barrage of new information, and the constantly shifting state of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the world? My answer is that we ourselves must change, even transform, to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;face the challenges of our day. As Frank Herbert wrote in his epic novel 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Dune, &quot;&quot;Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The sleeper must awaken.&quot; I believe that we must awaken the sleeping 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;giants within ourselves to survive and thrive in this dawning age of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change. But what changes must we face?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;First we have to be prepared to live longer. In 1990 there were just over 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;3 million people in the United States age 85 or older. In the past ten 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years that number has risen by nearly a million and a half. The numbers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for 75 to 84 have increased by two million. We as a nation are living 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;longer, and living fuller and more productive lives as we age, than we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have in any point in history. Medical technology has advanced enough, even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assuming no further growth in knowledge, that it is very likely that most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if not all of the people in this room could live to see one hundred years 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Next, be prepared for a more prosperous world. Over the next thirty years 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there will be an unprecedented boom in production worldwide, ensuring a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worldwide standard of living and relative comfort never before possible. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As a result, our energies will be turned to creating and exploring on a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;level not seen since the European renaissance. As the cost of travel 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;across the globe decreases and the flow of information increases, there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be more opportunity for those who wish to travel to do so, and more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contact with people from different cultures both face to face and on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Internet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Finally, be prepared for more choice in nearly every aspect of life. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Already choices of lifestyle and occupation are more diverse than ever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before, and the byproduct is an ever-increasing tolerance of those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;choices. As productivity increases the trend toward more free time and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more money to spend on that time will only increase correspondingly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So how do we prepare ourselves for these changes? First, take care of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;body, and try to expand your physical capabilities. While replacement 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parts are becoming more common, my personal belief is that it is better to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have the original factory equipment until something truly better arrives. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Secondly, take care of your mind, and expand it whenever possible. Learn 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;languages, take courses, follow whatever interests you may have, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continue to learn and expand your brainpower. In a world dominated by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change and possibility a flexible and well-trained mind is one of the best 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tools you can have. Finally, strive for self-direction in every aspect of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your own life. Make goals, make decisions, seek out freedom and openness. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I can't tell you exactly how you should individually each prepare for and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cope with the coming changes in our world, as Franklin Roosevelt said, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still.&quot; What I can tell you, though, is to strive to improve and expand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yourself in any way you feel is right for you. Challenge yourself to learn 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and grow. Awaken your sleeper.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?

A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
