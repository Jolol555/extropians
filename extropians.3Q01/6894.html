<p>Now you are going toward something that would actually work.  Back during the
<br>
cold war I advocated not doing the Star Wars project, and instead, taking only
<br>
half the money and dropping it on the USSR in $100 bills.  I reasoned that this
<br>
would start a instant black market in hard currency among the peasants that would
<br>
have destroyed the system.  You have to realize that paper money is just that,
<br>
paper.  What good is it without US to back it up?  When they would go to spend
<br>
it, where would a great deal of the goods and services come from?  Why, from US
<br>
and our workers.
<br>
<p>The USSR was a special case, and I do not think this is a way to go now.  Now I
<br>
think the way to go is to have individual families in the US adopt individual
<br>
families in the Muslim world and work on the human to human level.  It is,
<br>
unfortunately, the standard practice of Americans to only get to know the other
<br>
people in the world by going to war against them.  Let us hope that this time the
<br>
&quot;getting to know&quot; part outruns the &quot;going to kill&quot; part.
