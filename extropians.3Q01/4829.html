<p><em>&gt;I don't think this person has ever done any long term teaching in the
</em><br>
public 
<br>
<em>&gt;schools.  I am a former teacher, and my experience shows that the
</em><br>
people
<br>
who 
<br>
<em>&gt;make the best teachers are those who are the least educated.  The
</em><br>
&quot;smart&quot; 
<br>
<em>&gt;ones, the ones who are interested in science, usually leave the
</em><br>
profession 
<br>
<em>&gt;rather quickly (because they get tired of the abuse). In fact, the
</em><br>
empirical 
<br>
<em>&gt;evidence shows (at the empirical evidence to which *I* have access)
</em><br>
that
<br>
the 
<br>
<em>&gt;halflife of a teacher's career is inversely proportional to his/her IQ.
</em><br>
<p>Just to add a small statistical sample / anecdote to your contention,
<br>
<p>I went to A big state school for two years, University of Connecticut,
<br>
then
<br>
transferred to a community college.  I found the teachers at the
<br>
community
<br>
college to be much better, much more personable, etc. etc.  I think this
<br>
was
<br>
because they werent teaching for the money (its community college after
<br>
all)
<br>
they were teaching because they like to teach.  I think out of the 8
<br>
classes
<br>
I have taken there I had one teacher I didnt like, and out of the 32 or
<br>
so
<br>
classes I took at UCONN, I had two teachers I did like.  
<br>
<p>I also think this is becuase the big schools have the teachers working
<br>
on
<br>
expirements on thesis and such, while you get stuck with a TA.  My
<br>
community
<br>
college professors probably are on the average scale (maybe even below
<br>
average) for expertise in thier field, but they were great professors
<br>
and I
<br>
learned a lot from them.
