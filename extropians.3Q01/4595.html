<em>&gt;&gt; (2), only time and the incremental processes of economic advance
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; It would be extremely surprising to find that Eugenics could
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Oh, certainly not!  I'm actually somewhat surprised that many
<br>
people today do not realize that eugenics could indeed affect
<br>
all the characteristics I describe in (1).
<br>
<p>When I was 23, I taught elementary school, and there was a very
<br>
wise elderly teacher who I enjoyed talking to.  Telling her
<br>
about one of the real problem kids in my class, she clutched
<br>
my arm one day and said, her old eye fixing me like a stake,
<br>
&quot;Oh, don't you know?  That boy's brothers and sisters aren't
<br>
at all like him.  You never saw such sweet children.  I tell
<br>
you that I knew that he would be trouble when I first saw
<br>
him a mere infant in his mother's arms.&quot;
<br>
<p>I challenged her statement, but she was emphatic that babies
<br>
indeed have different personalities, and that she had known
<br>
all along that this particular boy was going to be &quot;difficult&quot;.
<br>
Well, she was right about practically everything else she ever
<br>
told me, so I believed that too.
<br>
<p>But that meant that if babies had a certain amount of 
<br>
personality at birth then it came from..., there was
<br>
only one answer!  If some significant part of their
<br>
personalities didn't come from their environment, then
<br>
indeed they had to be genetic in origin.  It turns out
<br>
that this is something that has been known from time
<br>
immemorial but only unlearned in the 20th century, under
<br>
the ideological schools of behaviorism and misguided
<br>
anthropology.
<br>
<p>But the twin studies!  Far beyond what I had come to finally
<br>
accept in the early seventies, the twin studies hinted (if
<br>
not outright shouted) that a huge number of characteristics
<br>
lie in our genes.  One simply cannot read the results of
<br>
studies such as the famous Minnesota one without being awe-
<br>
struck at the similarities of identical twins raised apart.
<br>
<p>Now millenia before Darwin used their results and their common
<br>
knowledge to bolster his theories, breeders of plants and
<br>
animals knew full well that practically any trait of a species
<br>
could be bred at will.  We would like to think ourselves different,
<br>
perhaps.  But it's just not the case.
