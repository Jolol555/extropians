</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That sounds so enviable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>

<em>&gt;It is very different for those of us under estrogen sex hormones
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather than testosterone.  This may be one that you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand without being there.  Of course some guys become

</em><br>
<p>Yes, I know there are folks without human dignity who will carry their 
<br>
animal instincts out to their ultimate end (rape, murder, stalking, etc.) 
<br>
and you don't have to be female to realize that being the object of that 
<br>
sort of behavior would not be fun.  It goes without saying (but I guess I 
<br>
need to say it anyway) that that sort of thing is not what I had in mind.
<br>
<p>This is what I had in mind:  When I was an adolescent there were some girls 
<br>
who were so sexually attractive to me that I would have done most anything 
<br>
to get them in the sack.  I knew I had little or no chance of doing that so 
<br>
I would pine away in sexual fantasy.  If I was a female(particularly a 
<br>
sexually attractive female) I imagine there would be no such sexual pining 
<br>
away.  If I wanted it, I could get it, from just about any guy I wanted.  
<br>
(Or at least that's how my warped imagination perceives it working.)  
<br>
*That's* what seems like fun to me.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
