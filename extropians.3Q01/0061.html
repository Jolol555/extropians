<p>
The short version.  I can see why many mech-heads and AI
<br>
affectionados would generally hate this movie as well as why
<br>
some would love it.  The film is a real tear jerker dressed up
<br>
as sci-fi and making a swipe at some real issues.  The lead
<br>
character is truly fabulous.  
<br>
<p><p><p>**SPOILERS **
<br>
<p>Overall though I will pan the treatment of AI as altogether too
<br>
formula.  The AIs are human equivalent surrogates without human
<br>
gumption, self-defense, and the all-powerful and nearly idolized
<br>
by the movie *emotions*.  Until the AIs finally get emotion they
<br>
are just machines.  When the first AI does have emotions it is
<br>
still considered a machine simulating emotions, not a person -
<br>
not a full sentient with rights for sure.  David is considered
<br>
to be simply property.  David loves with a fantastic and
<br>
other-worldly love but he largely loves blindly becasue he is
<br>
programmed to.  It is his supergoal if you will.  This does show
<br>
an interesting point of what just programming in an emotion can
<br>
lead to and does show a minor point that emotions and real
<br>
desires can lead to creativity and devotion to purpose.  But
<br>
David, unlike a human child, cannot learn that those he loves
<br>
are not worthy of love or not trustworthy.  He simply goes on
<br>
loving forever.  And the film portrays this mindless causeless
<br>
feeling of and acting on an emotion as truly noble and
<br>
wondrous!  
<br>
<p>Do we meat beings really think that our emotions are what is
<br>
best about us and that feeling them utterly and monomaniacly is
<br>
a mark of tremendous virtue?  
<br>
<p>It is not believable that human level minds would be content to
<br>
simply wait until the humans wake up from their sleep every
<br>
night.  
<br>
<p>To me it is a plus though that the film portrayed humans as they
<br>
often are and are especially as they often are to &quot;other&quot;.  A
<br>
possible moral: evolve human beings before you have them
<br>
creating other intelligent lifeforms.  Except the moral is
<br>
lost.  Humans are thought wonderful in retrospect thousand of
<br>
years after they have died out. 
<br>
<p>Some of us often see AIs as our salvation.  It was not easy to
<br>
see them as &quot;toys&quot; and machines to satisfy humans who treat them
<br>
like property.  It was not easy to see them kept subservient and
<br>
only doing blindly with near-human realism only what they were
<br>
programmed to do.
<br>
<p>I will give the movie overall a &quot;B-&quot; as it at least is a really
<br>
good tear-jerker and does provoke some thought.
