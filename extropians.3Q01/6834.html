<em>&gt; Hmmm am not to sure about this you could probably lose ( misplace ) a

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as caves and small settlements.
</em><br>
<p><p>The mountainous region is about the size of California.  This is a large
<br>
area, but not prohibitively large for a couple reasons.  First of all, there
<br>
is almost no vegetation, so movement of people and equipment is easily
<br>
followed by our surveillance capabilities.  Second, we *do* have troops that
<br>
are well equipped for fighting that kind of war.
<br>
<p>The primary purpose of the light ground forces is to flush the opposing
<br>
forces, not engage them.  However, if a straight engagement was required it
<br>
would be very unbalanced in favor of American line troops.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As far as air support is concerned helicopters have problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the Afghan mountains due to the thinner air at altitude producing less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rotor lift.
</em><br>
<p><p>I wasn't talking about close air support, which is largely unnecessary for
<br>
the type of enemy we are talking about.  Close air support is useful for
<br>
light infantry when they are going up against heavier mechanized infantry,
<br>
but otherwise unnecessary.  The kind of air support I'm talking about is the
<br>
&quot;pave these coordinates&quot; type of air support.  Once a hostile target has
<br>
been flushed, use air support to reduce the exposure of our troops.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The Afghans became very adept during the conflict with Russia at suckering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russian SU25's into making attack runs that exposed them to stinger SAM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missile attacks, taking a pretty heavy toll. It's also  worth knowing that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SU25's flight performance is considerably better than the US equivalent the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A10 Warthog.
</em><br>
<p><p>The SU-25 is more of an armored attack jet than a close air support craft
<br>
and is markedly inferior to the A-10 in the close support role.  The Soviet
<br>
equivalent of the A-10 never went into production so they were left with the
<br>
SU-25, which is something like a heavy version of the A-4 Skyhawk.
<br>
<p>Notable weaknesses of the SU-25 compared to the A-10 are short range, half
<br>
the ceiling, low endurance, small ordnance load, and much less ability to
<br>
absorb damage.
<br>
<p>Note that the SU-25 was modified over the Afghan conflict to provide much
<br>
better protection against single SAM hits.  In fact, after the initial
<br>
losses of SU-25 jets early in the war, the Soviets lost almost none with
<br>
their improved versions, even though they did get hit.  Many of the
<br>
improvements are jury-rigged versions of features that were found on the
<br>
A-10 in the durability department (e.g. the ability to absorb multiple SAM
<br>
hits).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Thats great but Bin Laden, and the Taliban if they are attacked, are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very likely to stay in the lowlands. As you pointed out the Afghans fought a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very successful campaign from the mountains against Russia. They also did the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same to us Brits in around 1920. In fact they have pretty much done the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing every time they have been invaded.
</em><br>
<p><p>The point is to limit the amount of terrain that they can reasonably occupy
<br>
and to cut off supply lines.  Everyone knows they will head into the hills,
<br>
but we want to create an incentive to not leave the safety of the hills.
<br>
Systematically contain the problems.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The ability of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the US to control the mountainous terrain, something we are well-structured
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for, will determine whether or not this play is successful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In what way is the US force structure capable in this kind of roll. Trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to cover hundreds of kilometers of saw backed mountains. Units forced to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operate for days ( at least at a time ) isolated form support, seems to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly what US forces are not tailored for.
</em><br>
<p><p>We have divisions specifically designed for this role.  The whole concept of
<br>
light infantry is a highly mobile unit that requires minimal logistical
<br>
support, and which operates in terrain that is poor for mechanized units.
<br>
Since light infantry generally operate without support or protection from
<br>
armor, they learn to use the rugged terrain to avoid the heavy mechanized
<br>
units (which would slaughter LI) and typically are used to engage other
<br>
lightly armored units in very rugged terrain.  These are exactly the types
<br>
of units that would be needed.  They can move very fast and a combat company
<br>
can actively manage a one or two hundred square miles in the kind of terrain
<br>
we are talking about (though I doubt anyone would be sitting still that
<br>
long).  Throw in some intelligence from satellites and spy planes, and
<br>
things become pretty easy.  It is still cat and mouse, but of a kind that is
<br>
highly favorable for American units.
<br>
<p>The US has a few divisions of these units.  I was in the 7th Light Infantry
<br>
Division as a line grunt, so I do have a pretty good idea of how these units
<br>
operate.  We did nothing but exercises in mountainous terrain, as big flat
<br>
areas make you fodder for armor and air attacks.  This involved covering
<br>
many, many miles in the mountains for days (and nights) without support.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This whole scenario involving ground troops imho could become extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protracted and costly for the US.
</em><br>
<p><p>Quite possibly protracted, but not terribly costly.  The modern light
<br>
infantry learned a lot in the 20th century and has become very adept at
<br>
avoiding ambushes and controlling their sparse battlefield.  The rule to
<br>
remember is that you can't stop and hideout -- that is a death wish in an LI
<br>
duel, particularly when the other side has air superiority.  And you *will*
<br>
be found eventually.  But if the target is continually moving, it becomes
<br>
vulnerable to being spotted by surveillance.
<br>
<p>The Soviet Union did not have this luxury the last time they were in
<br>
Afghanistan.  Their biggest weakness was a heavy dependency on mechanized
<br>
units.  The development of &quot;light&quot; un-mechanized units in the US really came
<br>
into its own in the second half of the 20th century.  Many years of fighting
<br>
wars in jungles instead of on the plains of Europe made the US military
<br>
reconsider the capabilities of our force structure.  Hence the development
<br>
of light infantry divisions and similar.
