<p>
Natasha Vita-More has had a a nasty infestation of several computer 
<br>
viruses. These slipped in since we disabled the last virus checker that 
<br>
only made things worse.
<br>
<p>PLEASE DO NOT OPEN ANY ATTACHMENTS IN EMAILS RECEIVED FROM NATASHA IN THE 
<br>
LAST FEW DAYS.
<br>
<p>Natasha's computer was infected with at least these viruses:
<br>
TROJ_HYBRIS (with varying suffixes)
<br>
VBS_STAGES.A
<br>
<p>She is getting numerous emails supposed from &quot;Jennifer&quot;, though this does 
<br>
*not* appear to be the recent virus offering pictures of Jennifer Lopez. If 
<br>
you see messages from that name, run a virus scan immediately.
<br>
<p>We spent much of yesterday hunting down viruses and exterminating them. The 
<br>
virus checking software got stuck after 15 minutes, claiming to have found 
<br>
20,000 copies of one virus. (I think that was incorrect, and they were all 
<br>
inside a zip file.)
<br>
<p>Trend Micro's antivirus software, which we have now both installed, is 
<br>
supposed to catch viruses in incoming email. However, it completely missed 
<br>
one that I received this morning. I recognized it immediately by the text 
<br>
and the attachment, and so deleted the attachment and message and emptied 
<br>
the recycle bin.
<br>
<p>Natasha may be offline for a couple of days, since it looks like one virus 
<br>
corrupted system files, making her programs crash constantly.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure I trust Trend Micro anti-virus software after it got stuck 
<br>
last night (though eventually seemed to clean the computer), and then 
<br>
missed a virus on my computer this morning. I've tried Norton and McAfee 
<br>
before and didn't like them. Any recommendations?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
<p>Max
