<br>
<p>Matt,
<br>
<p>I am the coordinator of the Coalition for Constitutional Liberties and
<br>
we are currently circulating a letter to organizations about the privacy
<br>
violations involved in the drug war. This letter does not call for
<br>
legalization at all, it simply brings forth important privacy related
<br>
issues. With this letter, we are calling for the Senate Judiciary Committee
<br>
to ask the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy nominee,
<br>
John Walters, if he will protect privacy. Please consider signing on and
<br>
perhaps sending it to your list.
<br>
<p>Thanks! Email Hannah Woody at <a href="mailto:hwoody@freecongress.org?Subject=Re:%20ACTION:%20Protecting%20Privacy,%20SIGN%20THIS%20LETTER&In-Reply-To=&lt;v0422080cb7bd5a51fbd3@[198.4.94.240]&gt;">hwoody@freecongress.org</a>

<p>September 3, 2001
<br>
<p>Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, Chairman
<br>
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, Ranking Member
<br>
Senate Judiciary Committee
<br>
United States Senate
<br>
224 Dirksen Office Building
<br>
Washington, DC 20510
<br>
<p>Re: Nomination of John Walters
<br>
<p>Dear Chairman Leahy, Senator Hatch and
<br>
Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee:
<br>
<p>We are part of a broad coalition of groups concerned that the War on Drugs
<br>
has degraded our privacy and civil liberties.  We respectfully ask that the
<br>
members of Committee consider raising the following privacy and civil
<br>
liberties issues in connection with the nomination of John Walters to be the
<br>
Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (Office of the White
<br>
House).  We intend by issuing this letter to signal neither support nor
<br>
opposition to Mr. Walters' nomination.  Rather, we hope are issuing the
<br>
letter to urge members of the Committee to explore these issues in
<br>
connection with Mr. Walters' nomination.  As we set forth below, these
<br>
issues include the use of new surveillance and investigative technologies,
<br>
including the Carnivore/DCS1000 and Echelon systems, the &quot;Know Your
<br>
Customer&quot; proposal of the Financial Action Task Force, asset forfeiture
<br>
abuses, wiretaps and the drug war's sometimes corrupting influence on law
<br>
enforcement itself.
<br>
<p>Rapid advances in technology have unfortunately brought with them new
<br>
opportunities for the invasion of privacy in the form of programs like
<br>
Carnivore, a system designed to allow the FBI to sift through vast
<br>
quantities of Internet communications, or &quot;Know Your Customer,&quot; -a proposed
<br>
regulation requiring banks to collect personal financial information about
<br>
their customers, &quot;profile&quot; them, and report &quot;suspicious activities&quot; to the
<br>
Government.  The misguided drug war is often a driving force behind these
<br>
initiatives.  &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; was prompted largely to further the drug
<br>
war by combating drug-related money laundering.  The FBI claims that
<br>
Carnivore helps in narcotic investigations.
<br>
<p>We are concerned that &quot;profiling,&quot; including racial profiling, appears to be
<br>
an accepted component of the federal government's war on drugs.  As noted by
<br>
Georgetown University Law professor David Cole, characteristics of &quot;drug
<br>
courier profiles&quot; used by U.S. Customs at airports have included:
<br>
*	Arrived late at night.
<br>
*	Arrived early in the morning.
<br>
*	Arrived in afternoon ...
<br>
*	One of first to deplane.
<br>
*	One of last to deplane.
<br>
*	Deplaned in the middle ...
<br>
*	Bought coach ticket.
<br>
*	Bought first class ticket ...
<br>
*	Used one-way ticket.
<br>
*	Used round-trip ticket ...
<br>
*	Traveled alone.
<br>
*	Traveled with a companion ...
<br>
*	Wore expensive clothing.
<br>
*	Dressed casually ...
<br>
*	Suspect was Hispanic.
<br>
*	Suspect was black female.
<br>
In short, everyone anywhere at any time could fit the profile of a drug
<br>
courier according to U.S. Customs officials. Court records confirm that
<br>
highway patrol officers both in California and in New Jersey were taught to
<br>
profile automobile drivers using minority status as an excuse to stop them,
<br>
search their car, and in some cases, find drugs, a process known as racial
<br>
profiling.  In fact, civil rights organizations have charged that the DEA's
<br>
own Operation Pipeline actually trains state and local law enforcement
<br>
agents to engage in racial profiling.
<br>
<p>The extent to which our drug policy drives government surveillance and
<br>
invasion of privacy is especially clear in the case of wiretaps.  Three
<br>
quarters of all wiretaps are authorized for narcotics investigations.  The
<br>
Administrative Office of the United States Courts reports that annually
<br>
approximately 80 percent of conversations intercepted on wiretaps are
<br>
innocent communications.
<br>
<p>In addition to government surveillance, there has been an increasing effort
<br>
to have private businesses monitor their customers in order to fight the
<br>
drug war.  In the case of the &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; proposal now being
<br>
resurrected by the FATF, the government attempts to force customer
<br>
monitoring through regulation.  More and more often, the DEA is using
<br>
financial incentives to induce businesses to report personal information
<br>
about their customers to the government.  This undermines both consumer
<br>
privacy and businesses' relationships with their customers.  In April, the
<br>
Albuquerque Journal reported that Amtrak was providing access to its
<br>
ticketing database to the Drug Enforcement Administration.  Amtrak provided
<br>
agents with information such as passengers' last names, their destinations,
<br>
their method of payment, and whether they were going on a round trip or only
<br>
one-way.  In return, Amtrak was given 10% of anything the government seized.
<br>
Although controversy led Amtrak to discontinue the DEA's computer access,
<br>
the company still provides information gleaned from the ticketing system to
<br>
law enforcement officers and continues to receive a portion of assets seized
<br>
on trains by agents.  Several airlines reportedly have similar &quot;cash for
<br>
snooping and snitching&quot; programs.
<br>
<p>The Amtrak case demonstrates the degree to which forfeiture laws are giving
<br>
an incentive for law enforcement and private businesses to focus on seizing
<br>
property supposedly related to drug crimes.  The system is still very
<br>
susceptible to abuse and one does not have to be convicted of a crime before
<br>
their property is taken.  Before the passage of the Civil Asset Forfeiture
<br>
Act of 2000, which addressed some of the more egregious abuses, eighty
<br>
percent of people who had property forfeited were never charged with a
<br>
crime.  While this number will likely become lower because of the reforms,
<br>
the abuse of forfeiture laws continues.
<br>
<p>As reports (some of which were initiated by members of this Committee), have
<br>
shown, the war on drugs has had a corrupting influence on the
<br>
professionalism of law enforcement; one March 1999 GAO report described the
<br>
problem as a &quot;serious and continuing threat.&quot;
<br>
<p>We urge you to raise these issues with Mr. Walters and ask for assurances
<br>
that he will reform the conduct of the drug war in order to address these
<br>
problems and ensure that drug policies respect the privacy and other civil
<br>
liberties of all Americans.
<br>
<p>If you have any questions or would like to discuss these issues further,
<br>
please contact J. Bradley Jansen of the Free Congress Foundation at
