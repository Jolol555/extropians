Unless we can make the philosophic foundations of a transhumanist 
<br>
society once more a living intellectual issue, and its implementation 
<br>
a task which challenges the ingenuity and imagination of our liveliest 
<br>
minds, the prospects of dynamism are indeed dark. 
<br>
But if we can regain that belief in the power of ideas which was the mark of transhumanism at its best, the battle is not lost. It can be turned into victory. The intellectual revival of transhumanism must start.  Will it be in time?  I think it is still in time, especially if we add Aristotle to our discourse.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>Would the &quot;intellectual revival of transhumanism&quot; be achieved by ExI, the WTA, or Natasha's Pro-Act organization?  I guess Pro-Act would lay the groundwork so that a society could arise where transhumanistic thought would have a chance to really take root.  And she will need the foundation you are speaking of.  
<br>
<p>Should an extension of your goal come from a focus on getting a college curriculum together so that transhumanist thought will be taught at that level?  Will this ever actually be done?
<br>
<p>Is it time for a Transhumanist political party? : )  Do you ever see one being formed?  Could it become a force to be reckoned with, or would it simply be a fringe political group which would not be taken seriously by the media and political powers?  
<br>
<p>Again, when you say, &quot;intellectual revival of transhumanism,&quot; I wonder exactly what you mean.  I have read articles where journalists and so-called intellectuals mock the very idea of transhumanist/extropian philosophy.  They then go on the stereotype and pigeonhole what we &quot;supposedly&quot; believe in.  How will your intellectual revival counter this?
<br>
<p>And what happens if the revival does not happen in time?    
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
