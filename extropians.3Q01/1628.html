John Grigg candidly admits
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I love the idea of a minimal guaranteed annual income.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Largely because I tend  to be a lazy person unless I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply must take action for survival! lol
</em><br>
<p>Okay, it's time for me to confess to that also---I would be
<br>
very pleased if I didn't have to work, and could write email
<br>
and read books all day long (sigh).
<br>
<p>But the real question is, &quot;do you in good conscience advocate
<br>
it as public policy?&quot;.  Although I've pretty much given up on
<br>
the United States ever becoming a nation, or at least one that
<br>
I could whole-heartedly identify with, I still must state what
<br>
I think best for a society or a nation, when the relevant
<br>
questions come up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think even in a society of guaranteed income, we would see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most people working to better themselves.
</em><br>
<p>That depends on the people!  Your statements apply to some
<br>
sets of people in history, but very, very few.  In the current
<br>
United States, I don't think that the number of people who
<br>
would continue working would be adequate, because too many have
<br>
very dull, routine jobs, and too many (like me) have better 
<br>
things to do with their time.  The memes of industriousness,
<br>
hard work, prudence, and self-reliance would have to be a hell
<br>
of a lot stronger than they are now to make a go of it at the
<br>
present time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think it will be an incredible world when because of A.I. and mature nanotech 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we see homelessness, poverty and lack of good medical care wiped away.  I would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to see housing, power and food become very cheap so that people cannot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even fathom the way 20th and early 21st century have-nots lived.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that'll be great.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And I do not see this destroying the traditions of personal responsibility!  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People will just move up on Maslow's pyramid to achieve higher needs and wants. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I have already written here, the desire for status will do us well in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming age of incredible prosperity.
</em><br>
<p>I think that you're still talking about people like you
<br>
and the people you know.  A majority of people will just
<br>
non-stop party when their ship comes in.
<br>
<p>Lee
