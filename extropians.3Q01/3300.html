Josh Cahoon brought up the interesting asymmetry over various
<br>
dimensions as regards the desirability of personal processing.

<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Why should we want the graph to be unbound on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that [the time] axis rather than x or z?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Because we can become infinite on w without crowding out anybody else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Time exists for each of us independently.  On the other hand, we all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must share x, y, and z; for anyone to become infinite in all three of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those would be to immediately eliminate all other life (and all other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter) in the universe.
</em><br>
<p>If total resources in the three spatial dimensions are finite,
<br>
then you *are* crowding out other entities at some point in
<br>
the future.  My counter-argument to this is, why should they
<br>
exist at the price of your life?
<br>
<p>The same goes for our present 3-D universe.  I would gladly
<br>
run independent copies of my own program lightyears away
<br>
despite the lack of communication, and despite the fact that
<br>
by using resources there I was instrumental in preventing
<br>
other life forms from being born and using them.  This does
<br>
*not* need either justification or explanation; all day long
<br>
we optimize our own lives using resources that could instead
<br>
have been devoted to producing more of our kind.  The advocates
<br>
of population control constantly enjoin us to be selfish in
<br>
just this way.
<br>
<p>What needs explaining is why we would ever relinquish resources
<br>
for anyone else.  But our kindness and consideration of other
<br>
beings is amply explained in the current evolutionary literature.
<br>
<p>Anders writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Because the goal is increased complexity/information content, and we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only make it diverge by becoming unbounded in the time direction (we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bounded by our lightcone at least in the others).
</em><br>
<p>I would say that versions of ourselves spreading though intergalactic
<br>
space at approximately c would indeed experience unboundedness in the
<br>
three spatial directions, at least in the sense that they would obtain
<br>
new processing roughly in proportion to the cube of the time that they'd
<br>
been in flight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Actually, I think the above is pretty silly reasoning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Just thought I'd throw it out there.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; It may be silly, but it is not stupid.
</em><br>
<p>:-)  I didn't think it either silly or stupid.
<br>
<p>But no one can top Mark Walker's remark:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As middle-age approaches, I for one am having no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trouble spreading out on a couple of nontemporal axes.
</em><br>
