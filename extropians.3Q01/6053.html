probably the last person on here that would say anyone should be

here for dissenting for any majority held opinions.  I think my
<br>
posting style and comments since I've been here support that I
<br>
don't operate like that.  I am trying to understand how what I
<br>
said would be taken that way and why it caused people to drop
<br>
context of the type of person I thought I was visible as being. 
<br>
I am more than a bit taken aback.  How can I e-talk as much as I
<br>
have here and still remain that invisible?
