<p>This result - this whole experiment - is simply too strange to be
<br>
believed.  I mean that literally.  If Damien personally went over the
<br>
blinded raw data and used the simplest test he could think of and found
<br>
911 jumping out at him immediately, then my guess would be that the raw
<br>
data was faked.  Much worse has happened in the history of past psionic
<br>
investigations.
<br>
<p>I would admittedly, at that point, probably be willing to donate at least
<br>
ten bucks if Damien wanted to get his own EGG and try recording his own
<br>
raw data and looking for the next terrorist incident, because that is the
<br>
Process of Science for dealing with data you think might have been faked,
<br>
and if Damien then said that *he* spotted it, I would have to get my own
<br>
EGG and try it.
<br>
<p>But this whole experiment is simply too strange to be believed.  There is
<br>
no non-nitwit many-worlds explanation for it, or indeed any physical
<br>
explanation at all, except one; that a desire in the present day - the
<br>
desire of the experimenters to find weird correlations in their data -
<br>
affected the past recorded data.  That implies not only a solipsist kind
<br>
of universe, but a timeless, causality-violating solipsist Universe,
<br>
perhaps with no fixed past.  It gets us into terrority that not even Greg
<br>
Egan has explored.  Saying that the Universe is a computer simulation
<br>
doesn't cut it.  I would regard this as *disconfirming* the hypothesis
<br>
that the Universe is a computer simulation; simulations wouldn't be that
<br>
weird on the inside but this normal-looking on the surface; only physics
<br>
does that.  And easiest of all is for me to believe that they tortured the
<br>
data or that one prankster corrupted the data for 9/11.
<br>
<p>It is, literally, too strange to be believed.  I don't explain away the
<br>
crossing of the Red Sea as freak winds exposing the sea bottom; I assume
<br>
that the data was corrupted and that the report is memetic rather than
<br>
historical.  I am forced to assume the same for this experiment, and will
<br>
continue to do so unless and until the entire scientific community
<br>
confirms it, or they come up with an experimental method that I can
<br>
personally implement and verify.  If a DIY method is easy I'd do it just
<br>
for fun and for the glory of the Scientific Process; if it's hard, I
<br>
probably won't invest the effort unless someone like Damien says *he* did
<br>
it and it worked.
