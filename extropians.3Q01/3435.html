At 05:38 PM 8/7/01 -0700, James Rogers wrote, lucidly as ever:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My impression has generally been that social welfare is more equitable in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Australia and Europe with respect to race than it is in the U.S.
</em><br>
<p>The biggest difference is that ten percent of our population isn't derived
<br>
from visibly identifiable people long treated as chattels. Perhaps one or
<br>
two percent of the population are aboriginal people, with varying degrees
<br>
of black skin, and they do pretty badly (despite a lot of money thrown at
<br>
various aspects of their miserable circumstances). But they're often *so*
<br>
out of synch with the dominant culture that the very idea of entering
<br>
university rarely arises. Aboriginal and Islander people who *do* manage to
<br>
achieve schooling (often, to their later bitterness, after having been
<br>
raised by adoptive white families or institutions: `stolen generations'
<br>
abducted from their families under government order, `for their own good')
<br>
have abundant scholarships available, I believe. But Russell is probably in
<br>
a better position to comment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Circa 1990, I remember substantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inequality of opportunity with respect to college admissions, especially at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the &quot;good&quot; universities.  I had a wealthy black friend with modest academics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get accepted to a well-known law school that had rejected one of my other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;friends applying for the same program, a lower-middle class white guy with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;excellent academics. 
</em><br>
<p>Another way to deal with this `problem' is to put sufficient central
<br>
revenue funds into education that *everyone* has access to the limits of
<br>
their ability. I realize this isn't the American Way, but it's how it was
<br>
done in Australia during the '70s and '80s (and allowed me in my poverty to
<br>
go back and do a PhD--on a scholarship that paid my modest living expenses,
<br>
as well as tuition). More recently, conservative govts have throttled those
<br>
opportunities back. Now we seem on the verge of twitching again back to a
<br>
more `left-liberal' position. Makes sense to me. 
<br>
<p>Yet another method is to have loans available to all students, payable at
<br>
moderate interest well after graduation (and frankly, I'd cut a lot of
<br>
slack to those who fail, forgiving their debt: some people fuck up, but
<br>
let's not foreclose psychologically on their entry out of their *fear* of
<br>
fucking up). This is somewhat like the system we currently use in Oz, with
<br>
deferred payment--although wealthy parents can currently pay a smaller fee
<br>
up front; presumably this reduces expensive paperwork and saves the
<br>
institutions the risk of losing money on the kids who kill themselves, go
<br>
mad or default.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Hopefully this broadens your perspective some.
</em><br>
<p>Same here.
