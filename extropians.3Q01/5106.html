</em><br>
<p>&quot;Again, I mention that this might work if we were motivated by economics 
<br>
alone, but it isn't so. People develop allegiances and cartels and 
<br>
anticompetitive practices like price fixing. They use marketing tactics to 
<br>
push shoddy merchandise. They propagate false information using advertising 
<br>
and misleading labels. Companies don't work very well to regulate each 
<br>
other... that is why we have government-funded investigations into illegal 
<br>
operating practices of some companies.&quot;
<br>
<p>But those things never last.  Even when price fixing, say four companies get
<br>
together and agree to charge $5 for thier product, which cost $1 to
<br>
manufacture and distribute, they now share the market equally.  It will
<br>
always be in one of the companies best interest to undercutt the others.  If
<br>
those four companies each shared 25% of the market then it would be in one
<br>
of the companies best interest to now charge $4 for thier product since they
<br>
may take a far greater percentage of the market.  If the market is not
<br>
equally shared by all companies, then it is not in the companies that are
<br>
not recieving an equal share's best interest to continue with that
<br>
agreement.  Also, other companies who might not be making a competing
<br>
product would then decide to since they could undercutt all the price fixing
<br>
competitors and take the whole market.  In this way price fixing never
<br>
lasts, and it can never go past a certain point in price anway.  If all the
<br>
companies who sell milk decided to charge $4 a gallon, would you still drink
<br>
it?  $8?  $32?  There is always a limit that anyone will pay for a product,
<br>
even in a monopoly the price is kept in check.  
<br>
<p>And I agree that companies market crappy products and shoddy services, but
<br>
these are all short term fluctuations in a long term scale.  Some products
<br>
may gain market dominence and be less effecient for a period of time, but
<br>
the general trend always increases the reliability of the product and the
<br>
quality of the services provided.  Show me one product that is manufactured
<br>
today that is inferior to an identical product manufactured in 1950 that
<br>
cost the same amount in median average man-hours worked.  
<br>
<p>&quot;I sorely doubt that trade unions would have much power in a free market... 
<br>
but that is just my opinion.&quot;
<br>
<p>And for what reason do you think that would be the case?  There is no reason
<br>
why employees could not choose to unionize and demand certain working
<br>
conditions.  It is also reasonable that self interested private regualtory
<br>
groups would ensure that working conditions meet a minimum.  In other words,
<br>
instead of a government label from OSHA a private group will certify that
<br>
company follows employee treatment standards.  If they do not follow those
<br>
standards, they do not get certification from that private regulatory
<br>
company (or many, competing ones) in which case an employee will say 'Are
<br>
you certified by such and such?'  This will not require a great increase in
<br>
awarenss or intelligence by the consumer, as it would be in the regulatory
<br>
companies best interest to make the average potential employee aware of such
<br>
standards.  Perhaps you can point out a fallacy in this logic?
<br>
<p>&quot;As I have stressed time and time again. I am not against competitive 
<br>
capitalism. I am just wary of removing the most powerful control on 
<br>
corporate excess: government. &quot;
<br>
<p>I do see that you are not philosophically opposed to it, nor am I a
<br>
philosophical only supporter of it.  My background is actually in
<br>
philosophical skepticism, that is people who apply the methodology of
<br>
science to the rest of the world, that is, empirical edification and peer
<br>
review, etc. etc.  The evidence suggests that if markets were open and
<br>
companies were allowed to compete, everyone, even the poor, would benefit.
<br>
If evidence arises to suggest otherwise, I would abandon that belief.  I
<br>
dont think the goverment is the most powerfull control of corporate excess,
<br>
I think the demand provided by the consumer is.  If people dont want a
<br>
product, they dont want it.  I really have no desire to get a muffler
<br>
extension to make it sound like my muffler has a hole in it, and no amount
<br>
of advertising will convince me that I do.
<br>
<p>&quot;I have no particular love of government 
<br>
either, being very conscious of how that power has been misused in the past 
<br>
too. All I am saying is that we must use the practical tools we have to 
<br>
limit the dangers of extreme power.&quot;
<br>
<p>I agree, but you have yet to show that dangers will arise from allowing
<br>
those markets to be open.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Already companies rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other products, like Consumer Reports, other companies like United
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Labratoris test and rate products.  Companies and services like this would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have much larger and powerfull roles.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;These sorts of things have shown up in some small way in the recent past 
<br>
and that is encouraging, but so far the bulk seem to be non-profit, 
<br>
generally government-supported.&quot;
<br>
<p>Exactly, what place does a competing private regulatory company have in an
<br>
environment where the government already regulates everything, albiet very
<br>
expensively and innefiently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;To remove feedback leads rapidly to things spiralling out of control, as
</em><br>
we
<br>
<em>&gt;have seen so many times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in the past.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Which supports my suspicion that you mis-understand what exactly a free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;market entails.  It is not free reign for companies to do whatever they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want.  They will be regulated by how much a consumer is willing to pay and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what that consumer wants in a product.  These are the best forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feedback, instead of a government 'committee' trying to figure out what it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinks the best thing for everyone else is, instead of letting the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decide for themselves.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;:-)
<br>
Have you heard of the terms &quot;negative feedback&quot; and &quot;positive feedback&quot;? I 
<br>
mean in the engineering sense. Negative feedback is a stabilising system 
<br>
that corrects a change by using some of the output as a retarding input. 
<br>
Positive feedback is like the howlround when a microphone squeals.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes, I am very familiar with those terms, my background is in physics,
<br>
science, philosophy of science, evolutionary biology (of which it is a
<br>
frequent themse, in, for example, the positive feedback effect that sexual
<br>
selection had on the ... peacocks tail for example) 
<br>
<p>&quot;I can't see consumers being too much of a corrective force on companies 
<br>
when we have the proven power of positive feedback in the form of marketing 
<br>
and related strategies. &quot;
<br>
<p>Again, people will only pay a certain price for certain items, and no more.
<br>
This is why ketchup does not cost $100 per bottle.  Nobody would pay it,
<br>
even if all the ketchup companies decided to price fix at that, people would
<br>
switch to a different condoment.  If that was price fixed as well, they
<br>
would switch to nothing.  In the end, no amount of artifical impositiong of
<br>
demand, which is a valid part of capitalism, will convince the average
<br>
consumer to work 40 man-hours to pay for a bottle of ketchup.
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes, there is some corrective power in the hands of 
<br>
the consumer, but nothing like the forces that cause corporations to merge 
<br>
into more and more powerful monolithic corporations. If we throw away 
<br>
government, our only really effective tool in breaking up dangerously large 
<br>
monopolies, then we are just on the path to feudalism -- that will not be 
<br>
the way to the free market that you want.&quot;
<br>
<p>For that to happen a corporation would have to have total and absolute
<br>
control over a market.  That can not happen in a free market economy because
<br>
you can not force people to pay something for something that they do not
<br>
want.  Unless, of course, you call it a tax and market it under a social
<br>
program...Can you elaborate a little more on how a free market economy could
<br>
lead to fuedilism, perhaps I am just not following the logic?
<br>
<p>&quot;You see the paradox here? We need a government to ensure that you get your 
<br>
free market. Left to themselves corporations divide up the field among 
<br>
themselves and eliminate competition.&quot;
<br>
<p>and how exactly do they eliminate the compeition?  By selling thier product
<br>
for less, in which case the competitor will then either sell thier product
<br>
for less, make it better for the same price, or go out of business.  Should
<br>
they succeed in eliminating the competition and charging whatever they want
<br>
for a product, they will still be limited by A) a consumer not wanting to
<br>
pay that much for said product and B) creating an economic incentive for a
<br>
competitively sized multi national corporation to enter the market.  Either
<br>
way, they are not truly free to charge whatever they want.  Even for a
<br>
necessity, like Oil, if the oil producing nations charged whatever the
<br>
wanted for oil and we had no domestic reserves (for example) then at some
<br>
dollar value per barrel, it would be economically beneficial for us to
<br>
sysnthesize fuel right out of the hydrogen and carbon in the air using
<br>
nuclear reactors as power sources.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Capitalism works very well if you are rich. If you are not then you need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;other means. The biggest mistake rich classes make is in supposing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;they don't benefit from the poor improving their lot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sounds like you have some more misconceptions about free marketers...
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Actually, it seems that I understand it a bit better than you do. &quot;
<br>
<p>I suspect this may not be the case, as you cite 'monopolies' and 'price
<br>
fixing' as reasons why it will not work, neither of which are valid.
<br>
<p>&quot;You are 
<br>
oversimplifying what is a complex web of motivations. People are motivated 
<br>
by much more than money.&quot;
<br>
<p>They certainly are, but when those motivations are introduced in a company
<br>
in a competing market place, they will be weeded out by companies that have
<br>
focused thier motivation on money, as thier prices will necssarily be higher
<br>
or thier products of lower quality.
<br>
<p>&quot; Worse, it can easily become a way of ensuring that 
<br>
class barriers remain.&quot;
<br>
<p>I disagree with this, as even the lowest economic class has more
<br>
conveniences and longer lives today then at any time in history, and this is
<br>
directly because large corporations are competing against other while trying
<br>
to maximize profits.  This is why food is cheap and plentiful, and why the
<br>
global economic median has risen contiually througout history.
<br>
<p>&quot; The tricky task is to use the better parts of 
<br>
capitalism while suppressing the worst.&quot;
<br>
<p>Indeed, and if you present evidence to me that suggests a free market could
<br>
use a little bit of regulation and everyone will be better off while not
<br>
violiting the rights of any individual, I will change my perspective...
<br>
<p>&quot;In most of your reply you made the same mistake that many people make when 
<br>
I express anything less than unqualified enthusiasm for capitalism. There 
<br>
are more positions than totally for capitalism and totally against 
<br>
capitalism. It reminds me of religion.&quot;
<br>
<p>And you make the common mistake of using invalid objections to it.  I do not
<br>
profess a false dichotomy on this issue, as I mentioned above, show me some
<br>
evidence that a market that is a *little bit* regulated is better than a non
<br>
regulated one and I will switch my opinion.
<br>
<p>Regards...
