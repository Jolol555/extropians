<p>Oh, sure, we're all cranks and buffoons here.

<p><em>&gt; Splitting hairs with the ATP argument. ATPase enzyme is embedded in a

</em><br>
<p>Splitting hairs with electric motors being impossible at nanoscale:
<br>
magnetic field generation does not occur in an electrostatic motor,
<br>
because a charged multipole gets yanked around by a synchronously
<br>
oscillating electric field, not massive current.
<br>
<p>A world class expert as your Oz person does of course know that a current
<br>
is defined by transport of charged moieties, and of course a current
<br>
generates a magnetic field -- always -- but that magnetic field can be
<br>
sometimes considered negligable, because it gets compensated, or is too
<br>
small. Such as protons falling down a gradient, or movement of electrons
<br>
in a plate driven by an electric potential changing over time.
<br>
<p>Electrostatic motors work very well on cm scale (electret multipole,
<br>
plates hooked up to a ~kV oscillating potential), and it only gets better
<br>
from there down.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are some very nice examples of work where part of the ATPase enzyme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been attached to a surface and a small silicon bar or polystyrene bead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is attached to the protein rotor and the rotation of the silicon bar or bead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is observed if you supply the system with the right cocktail of chemical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ingredients. I've attached a PowerPoint presentation from a conference last
</em><br>

<p>Owls to Athens.

<p><em>&gt; Scientists like precision in language. 1 micron is 1000 times greater than

<p>How convenient: we, too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1 nanometer, hence perhaps Microtechnology is more appropriate than
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, I guess a structure of several megameters made from nanoscale
<br>
components needs to be called megatechnology. Similiar applies to
<br>
kilotechnology, decatechology, centatechnology and millitechnology. So
<br>
she's an expert in decatechnology, then, as critters are typically cm
<br>
scale.
<br>
<p>A great suggestion, I think her promotion to president of the Babel
<br>
commitee is imminent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; relate to both size and also the particular properties which are observed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for material at that scale which are not observed for larger-scale, i.e.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; micro and upwards, material. Hence when talking about nanobots the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implies the nano-scale and hence the arguments against such entities being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible at the nano-dimension.
</em><br>
<p>Science is not usually associtated with sophism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In conclusion, George does know what he is talking about with regards to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what our current understanding is of mechanisms and what might or might not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be possible based on our current knowledge of scientific principles.
</em><br>
<p>Arguments based on authority do sound hollow. There are no experts on
<br>
nanotechnology around, it's a huge, brand new field. Making detailed
<br>
predictions about what is possible, what is impossible, and what is
<br>
sensible at current stage at the game must hence necessarily appear
<br>
hubris.
<br>
<p>No one knows anything for certain. Claiming you are is good for grants and
<br>
ego, but it is not instrumental in the advancement of truth.
