<p><em>&gt;While not frivolous, it doesn't remove the threat.  If someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tries for nuclear blackmail, (or wants to take vengence on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;civilians) being able to stop 90% of their missiles won't stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them if they have a few.  And while it would reduce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;casualties, it wouldn't reduce the value of the threat, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;significantly reduce the quality of the revenge.
</em><br>
<p>Assuming we have ten ABM's available, the odds are good at stopping
<br>
10 or less in a 90% successfull system.
<br>
<p>The current defense plan is not designed to be all encompassing as
<br>
&quot;Star Wars&quot; was, but is designed to handle a limited number of
<br>
launches. It is not designed to be a defense in a superpower
<br>
struggle. However in a superpower struggle even a limited defense
<br>
may win the day vs no defense. 
<br>
<p>I think they ought to consider renaming it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;That said, there are still many cases in which having a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not-perfect defensive shield encourages attacks, and many in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it encourages potential attackers to invest in an arms race.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;haven't seen anything in this discussion to make me think we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much closer than 20 years to creating a near perfect interdiction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system given the approaches SDI considers.  If we (the gov't) save
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the billions of dollars that SDI proposes to spend on deploying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;partially effective systems in the short term, we (the people)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will have more money to spend developing technologies that may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make this whole approach obsolete.
</em><br>
<p>As I said, the current plan isn't for an all encompassing defense
<br>
against a superpower, it's a limited defense against a few rogue
<br>
missiles.
