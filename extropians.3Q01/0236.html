Subject: Forbidden Knowledge (Banned Research, Part II)
<br>
<p>Cypherpunks,
<br>
<p>A followup to my earlier items on banned research. People arguing
<br>
about the validity or need or danger of cloning research are missing
<br>
the basic point.
<br>
<p>Much of the discussion here, and from some &quot;echoes&quot; I've gotten back
<br>
from a list Declan forwarded my article to (Politech, I presume), has
<br>
focused on the _cloning_ issue, qua cloning. Some argue for why stem
<br>
cell research should be &quot;allowed,&quot; some argue that cloning is
<br>
intrinsically dangerous, some argue that there are no particular
<br>
hazards to cloning.
<br>
<p>This is an interesting technical area, but my article was about the
<br>
basic issue of the state deciding that some knowledge is too
<br>
dangerous to let non-approved persons and labs gain access to it.
<br>
And, equally basic and important, the troubling issue of how
<br>
non-judicial (not going through a court, through a jury of one's
<br>
peers, a la the Fourth and Sixth) means of enforcement are being
<br>
used: &quot;visits&quot; by regulatory agencies and worried burrowcrats, &quot;we're
<br>
ordering a timeout,&quot; &quot;consider this a warning shot across their bow,&quot;
<br>
and, in some cases, even predawn raids on those trafficking in
<br>
forbidden knowledge.
<br>
<p>Some have said the issue is public safety. Well, I mentioned this, in
<br>
the context of their perhaps being justification for stopping someone
<br>
or some company from assembling a nuclear weapon in their facilities.
<br>
More plausibly, manufacture of nerve gas and biological warfare
<br>
agents.
<br>
<p>No one has persuasively argued that human cloning research justifies
<br>
this kind of restriction based on imminent danger--there is no
<br>
&quot;danger&quot; of clone mutants, for example, running amok in a
<br>
neighborhood. There _might_ be a bunch of failed implant attempts,
<br>
failed attempts to bring a fertilized egg to term. Ditto for various
<br>
experiments with artificial insemination, fertility drugs, etc. But
<br>
no particular &quot;imminent danger&quot; requiring police action to protect
<br>
the safety of others.
<br>
<p>(Someone on the other list talked about that old chestnut &quot;Shouting
<br>
&quot;Fire&quot; in a crowded theater.&quot; I say chestnut for the obvious reasons:
<br>
even Holmes concluded later in his life that it has been appropriated
<br>
for all sorts of appeals to censorship and restrictions on basic
<br>
rights. And of course that old chestnut had the modifier &quot;falsely&quot; in
<br>
the equation. The connection with the Rael group's work on cloning is
<br>
an exercise I'll leave for students and lawyers in Texas.)
<br>
<p><p>The real issue is about a move toward &quot;permission requirements&quot; for
<br>
research. We came _this_ close to having such restrictions on crypto
<br>
(examples familiar to Cypherpunks); whether such restrictions would
<br>
have withstood a challenge reaching the Supreme Court is unclear. And
<br>
we have seen the Felten/DMCA nonsense, where researchers cannot even
<br>
do basic analysis of published specs! And nuclear, chemical, and
<br>
biological weaponry work.
<br>
<p>(There are even restrictions on such established things as _gun
<br>
research_. A hobbyist interested in building a better kind of rifle,
<br>
or even building an old-fashioned kind of rifle or handgun, has
<br>
committed various felonies merely by building such a thing without
<br>
having all sorts of expensive licenses and &quot;permission slips&quot; from
<br>
the BATF and probably other local, state, and federal agencies. Even
<br>
if he never sells his handiwork he has violated BATF
<br>
regs...essentially a licensing restriction on R &amp; D. Not such a big
<br>
deal to Ruger or Kahr or Smith and Wesson, perhaps, but a mighty big
<br>
insult to the Constitution...and to the Founders, some of whom were
<br>
gun makers.)
<br>
<p>Tangential to this issue, but intersecting it, is the issue of
<br>
licensing in general. More and more employment requires that the
<br>
state issue a permission slip. As with the cloning arguments seen
<br>
here, the debate is usually couched in terms of &quot;public safety.&quot;
<br>
(Though how the licensing of fortune tellers, here in Santa Cruz, is
<br>
a matter of public safety is quite mysterious.) The real issue, as
<br>
readers of my stuff will know, is the creation and support of guilds:
<br>
licensing is a rent-seeking mechanism.
<br>
<p>(I mention &quot;readers of my stuff will know&quot; because I expect that if
<br>
Declan chooses to forward this article to his own list(s), I'll get
<br>
the predictable mini-flurry of questions and arguments from people
<br>
who basically are in other worlds of discourse, people with whom I
<br>
have little points of principle in common. To &quot;reach them,&quot; if I
<br>
cared to, I'd have to explain many more points than I have the time
<br>
to do in these articles sent out to Cypherpunks. Agree or not with
<br>
me, Cypherpunks mostly have some idea of what is meant by various
<br>
terms and ideas here.)
<br>
<p>To cut to the chase, we are seeing a transition to a world of:
<br>
<p>-- licensed and approved members of professions. Lawyers, doctors,
<br>
accountants, geologists, tax preparers, fortune tellers, even
<br>
engineers and programmers (in more and more states). At this rate,
<br>
Uncle Sam will have to give his blessing for any activity other than
<br>
purely amateur or leisure activity. This is NOT what the Constitution
<br>
is about. (And please don't anybody cite the &quot;commerce clause&quot;: the
<br>
1964 landmark case arguing that interstate commerce was affected by a
<br>
rib joint not serving blacks--hence making their discrimination
<br>
policies subject to Congressional rule--was pretty bogus even back
<br>
then. Arguing that a programmer needs to be licensed, regulated, and
<br>
controlled because he might sell a program across state lines is even
<br>
more bogus. People often lose sight of the forest for the trees.
<br>
<p>-- to a world where broad areas of research are banned or restricted
<br>
to controlled institutions. Seen with CBW research, and now cloning.
<br>
How long before it carries over to other areas in biology? Why not
<br>
restrict computer virus research? Or nanotech research?
<br>
<p>(Some of these areas are even &quot;dangerous.&quot; Imagine Ben Franklin being
<br>
arrested for &quot;conducting banned research into electricity&quot;? &quot;We are
<br>
ordering a timeout on Dr. Franklin's dangerous experiments with kites
<br>
and keys. We have it on good authority from our own experts that Dr.
<br>
Franklin might hurt himself. And, as we know, lightning causes fires.
<br>
Man was not meant to know such things...unless we in government are
<br>
doing the work. Dr. Franklin should consider this a warning shot.&quot; As
<br>
an exercise, make up a list of all of the other kinds of research
<br>
which might have been banned on the grounds that it might be
<br>
dangerous to the researcher or, someday, to others. &quot;But these flying
<br>
contraptions will no doubt crash and kill many innocent people. All
<br>
we are requiring is a &quot;timeout&quot; on this forbidden research by these
<br>
Wright brothers.&quot;)
<br>
<p>-- the &quot;ban on bomb-making instructions&quot; proposed by the usual
<br>
suspects is a variant on this issue. If such a ban is passed into
<br>
law, and upheld, how long before it carries over to requiring
<br>
encyclopedia editors excise articles on bombs, ANFO, and Astrolite?
<br>
How long before court transcripts are censored to remove forbidden
<br>
knowledge? (Ironically, Keith Henson recently reported to me that a
<br>
key piece of evidence offered up the Scientologists, in their &quot;friend
<br>
of the Toronto court&quot; brief, was an e-mail to Cypherpunks where I
<br>
mentioned Keith telling us at a local party how the McVeigh
<br>
transcript &quot;got it right&quot; on the real formation of Astrolite in the
<br>
OKC bombing. Apparently my citing of Keith's citing of CNN's citing
<br>
of the McVeigh trial testimony was enough to mark Keith as a
<br>
dangerous criminal. Interested Cypherpunks can retrieve this article
<br>
by using the obvious keywords in a search at Google, for example.)
<br>
<p>The next point shows where this takes us:
<br>
<p>-- and as with &quot;precursor chemicals,&quot; chemicals which _could_ be made
<br>
into methamphetamines or Sarin or other banned items, there will be
<br>
bans on &quot;precursor knowledge.&quot; This is probably exactly what is
<br>
happening now with the Rael group and their early work on human
<br>
cloning. Odds are excellent that they are at least several years away
<br>
from actually attempting a human cloning. It's the groundwork, the
<br>
precursor knowledge, that the government is now cracking down on. A
<br>
very disturbing trend.
<br>
<p>-- fortunately, these &quot;warning shots&quot; will perhaps accelerate a
<br>
transition into cypherspace.
