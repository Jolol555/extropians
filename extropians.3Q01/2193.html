<p>I don't think so.  It followed an almost spiritual theme that is common in
<br>
Japanese anime.  However, note that the heroes were scientists while the
<br>
antagonist didn't understand the science.  Note that the heroes used science
<br>
and technology to research and solve the problem.  The antagonists wanted to
<br>
just blow things up without studying them.  Even if you don't believe the
<br>
Gaia theory in real life, the story seemed pro-science and pro-technology to
<br>
me.
<br>
<p>I have a similar theory about the X-files.  It is fiction set in a fictional
<br>
world.  In that world, there are monsters, aliens and government plots.  We
<br>
see them on the screen, and they are real in the story.  Mulder believes the
<br>
truth because he researched the facts.  Others disbelieve because they
<br>
refuse to listen.  Therefore, I interpret X-Files as an example of
<br>
pro-logical thinking.  The investigation finds the truth.  They have even
<br>
had cases where Mulder specifically disbelieves faked UFO landings, because
<br>
the evidence doesn't match what he usually sees at real UFO landing sites.
<br>
He is no more irrational for believing in UFOs than Captain Kirk was
<br>
irrational for believing in Vulcans.  In the story, they are real.
<br>
<p>The only problem comes from people who can't tell the difference between
<br>
fiction and reality.  X-Files is so real, that people might think it is a
<br>
true story.  Final Fantasy shows scientists supporting spiritual beings in
<br>
nature, so people might believe that science really supports these things.
<br>
Is that any worse than bad Dr. Who science or Saturday morning cartoons?  Do
<br>
we want to limit entertainment to factually correct concepts?
<br>
<p>I think these shows are totally consistent and rational within their own
<br>
setting.  The characters rationally use science and investigation to seek
<br>
out the truth.  In these stories, the truth involves science-fictional
<br>
aspects that are unlikely to be the same as real life.  I find it hard to
<br>
fault a sci-fi show for being nonrealistic.
