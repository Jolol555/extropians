<p>[Note, I don't think this is an accurate paraphrase of Robin's posting.]
<br>
<p>One thing that does come through in the on-line articles is the damage
<br>
to the Drexlerian nanotech vision done by its association with cryonics.
<br>
We had some discussion last year about a similar article in Nature that
<br>
made the same connection (might have been by one of the same guys).
<br>
<p>Where cryonicists see nanotech as lending credibility to their field,
<br>
the rest of the world sees nanotech's credibility as being destroyed by
<br>
the connection to cryonics.  Most people seem to have an strong prejudice
<br>
that cryonics cannot (or should not?) work, and any technology that
<br>
could supposedly make it work becomes instantly suspect.
<br>
<p>Much of the criticism of nanotech in the sciam articles brings in its
<br>
supposed utility for cryonics, as though that is a sort of reductio ad
<br>
absurdum that proves the vision is false.  Super computers, ultra strong
<br>
materials, even self replication may be acceptable dreams.  But raising
<br>
the dead is beyond the pale.
<br>
<p>I tend to agree with Robert above that ultimately this is due to the
<br>
understanding that if cryonics works, if currently dead people are some
<br>
day brought back to life, then we are all responsible for a holocaust
<br>
beyond imagining.  Every person allowed to die today without suspension
<br>
is an unnecessary and preventable death.  As Robert says, the blood of
<br>
billions is on our hands.  Most people are not able to deal emotionally
<br>
with the horror of this possibility.
<br>
<p>(Of course, even most of us signed up for cryonics aren't doing anything
<br>
about it either, and we are the ones who are most likely to have to face
<br>
consequences eventually for our inaction.)
