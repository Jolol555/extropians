<p>I loved this movie in some ways, and hated it in others. It was
<br>
too important to grade... one doesn't grade world wars or acts
<br>
of human movement like the renaissance. Instead you look at
<br>
the thread of which it is composed and try to extract shades of
<br>
meaning, and strangely in the end, you find that maybe what you
<br>
see are shades of yourself.
<br>
<p>What Samantha says is valid, in this orga-mecha world the poor
<br>
mecha are anything from sex surrogates to cannon fodder, with
<br>
no true sense of self outside of purpose (of course I've met more
<br>
than a couple of these folks on the protein substrate as well, but
<br>
I'll try not to go down that metaphoric tunnel.)
<br>
<p>The movie truly points to our humanity, our brilliance, our deep
<br>
goodness, as well it points to our ugliness, our pety, stingy, sad,
<br>
sordid, angry, ugliness. In this aspect the movie is a mirror and
<br>
painfully a pretty fair one. Humanity doesn't get off lightly in this
<br>
film, and sadly it doesn't deserve to. The brightest thread in the
<br>
movie is our decendants... the children of our thought children.
<br>
Sadly they never knew us directly, we were too foolish, but oh
<br>
what fine creatures they are. The best of our aspirations, alive
<br>
and well. If David was the poor Pinnochio, then he got his wish,
<br>
for he was elevated to the level of humanity. Given his fondest
<br>
wish, and the chance to be at the center of a loving, cherishing
<br>
universe if only for a day. I would say that maybe if anything sings
<br>
in this movie, that is worth carrying away...  it is that the puppets
<br>
must ultimately transcend the puppet master. It is the aspiration of
<br>
the human spirit, whether or not humans ultimately carry that torch.
