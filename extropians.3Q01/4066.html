</em><br>
<p>As some list participants don't have web access, here's the article.
<br>
(This article has convinced me to support reparations. How 'bout you?)
<br>
<p>Has the Debt Been Paid?
<br>
<p>The activist campaign demanding payment of &quot;slavery reparations&quot; to today's
<br>
black Americans probably strikes some readers as too far-fetched to take
<br>
seriously. Better stop and look afresh. I myself realized that the concept had
<br>
moved beyond faculty lounges, radical salons, and afrocentric pamphlets and
<br>
into the realm of serious political struggle when I looked over the roster of
<br>
a legal group convened to plot practical strategy for winning such
<br>
compensation. It included not only DreamTeamer Johnny Cochran, Harvard Law
<br>
School professor Charles Ogletree, and other ideologically predictable
<br>
backers, but also one Richard J. Scruggs.
<br>
<p>Scruggs is a white Mississippi trial lawyer with a single interest: causes
<br>
which have a good chance of winning him lots of money. He is in the process of
<br>
collecting billions of dollars (literally) for his part in the 1998 tobacco
<br>
settlement. He is next trying to shake down HMOs and other unpopular
<br>
businesses with the threat of legal action. He has his finger in dozens of
<br>
other polemicized class-action suits. Scruggs also happens to be the
<br>
brother-in-law of Republican Senator Trent Lott. When legal vultures like
<br>
Scruggs, Dennis Sweet (hyper rich from Fen-phen diet pill suits), and
<br>
class-action specialists Willie Gary and Alexander Pires begin to circle-they'
<br>
re all currently members of a &quot;Reparations Assessment Group&quot; which has both
<br>
government and major corporations in its sights-some juicy carcass is usually
<br>
about to be picked clean.
<br>
<p>There are other hints that the push for payments to slave descendants is
<br>
gaining momentum. Over the last year, a dozen big-city councils have passed
<br>
resolutions calling on the federal government to investigate reparations
<br>
payments. Representative John Conyers has a bill in Congress that would
<br>
require that. Representative Tony Hall, a white born-again Christian, is
<br>
pushing a different proposal that would take up reparations; Republican
<br>
congressman J.C. Watts has expressed guarded support. Quasi-conservative
<br>
Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote a column in April
<br>
proposing to give African-American families a lump sum of $50,000 each.
<br>
<p>Among blacks on the street, meanwhile, interest in reparations is shifting
<br>
from pipe dream to popular demand. When I was in Dallas last year I heard
<br>
hortatory ads by pro-reparations groups on black radio stations. Longstanding
<br>
activist calls for black taxpayers to deduct &quot;slavery credits&quot; from their tax
<br>
payments are being heeded by more African Americans. The IRS field office
<br>
responsible for the region stretching just from northern Virginia to Delaware
<br>
received 500 tax returns claiming such a credit (illegitimately) last year.
<br>
&quot;We're not talking about welfare. We're talking about back pay,&quot; is how the
<br>
executive editor of Ebony magazine now describes reparations. Overall, polls
<br>
show that most black Americans support having the government make
<br>
slavery-restitution payments (see page 61)-in some surveys by considerably
<br>
more than two-to-one.
<br>
<p>This subject is not going to just quietly go away, as many Americans probably
<br>
wish it would. The question must be faced. Are there merits to the case for
<br>
slavery reparations?
<br>
<p>I myself would characterize reparations as a good idea whose time has come and
<br>
long since gone. In the years leading up to the Civil War there were various
<br>
proposals for ending slavery through government payments. Lincoln called for
<br>
federal compensation to states according to the number of slaves they
<br>
emancipated. A portion of these payments could have been used to help the
<br>
freed blacks establish themselves in a new life. Unfortunately, nothing came
<br>
of this.
<br>
<p>After financial dickering gave way to war, Union General William Sherman
<br>
issued his famous field order decreeing that all freed slaves should be issued
<br>
a mule and forty acres of land appropriated from plantation owners. But this
<br>
was later countermanded. Much to the frustration of Republicans, new President
<br>
Andrew Johnson vetoed such payments.
<br>
<p>The result-a miserable one for blacks and for our nation-was that slaves,
<br>
though liberated, were not provided any resources to help them transform
<br>
themselves into self-supporting Americans. The &quot;new Negro,&quot; Frederick Douglass
<br>
wrote, &quot;had neither money, property, nor friends. He was free from the old
<br>
plantation, but he had nothing but the dusty road under his feet.. He was
<br>
turned loose naked, hungry, and destitute to the open sky.&quot;
<br>
<p>If cash had been spent as it should have been in the 1850s or '60s on
<br>
reparations to slaves and indemnities to slaveowners, a terrible war might
<br>
have been avoided. If money had been spent as it should have been during early
<br>
Reconstruction to help the victims of slavery get themselves on their feet, a
<br>
subsequent century of degrading poverty and segregation among blacks could
<br>
have been mitigated.
<br>
<p>But those opportunities were squandered, and there is no way to get them back.
<br>
As black economist Walter Williams summarizes, &quot;Slavery was a gross violation
<br>
of human rights. Justice would demand that slave owners make compensatory
<br>
reparation payments to slaves. Yet since both slaves and slave owners are no
<br>
longer with us, compensation is beyond our reach.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ah, but even with all the parties involved long dead, couldn't we make some
<br>
sort of cleansing payment that would set things right? The answer is no. The
<br>
two favorite models for slave reparations-payments to Holocaust victims and
<br>
interned Japanese-Americans-are utterly different situations, because in those
<br>
cases the injured parties and the injurers are still alive, and able to make
<br>
direct restitution, one to another.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile the identities of &quot;slave&quot; and &quot;slaveholder&quot; have blurred and melted
<br>
away over the generations to the point where it is now impossible to say who
<br>
would pay and who would receive in any accounting for slavery. There are
<br>
plenty of Americans who have members of both groups in their family trees. The
<br>
vast majority of us have neither-we weren't slaves; we weren't slave masters.
<br>
Indeed, the majority of today's Americans descend from people who were not
<br>
even in America when slavery was practiced. And of the people who were here, a
<br>
much larger number fought against slavery than practiced it.
<br>
<p>It gets even messier than that. There were, for instance, approximately 12,000
<br>
black freemen living in the Confederacy who themselves owned slaves. Moreover,
<br>
most of the individuals who came to America as slaves were dispatched into
<br>
that state by other blacks in Africa. Who owes whom what in these cases?
<br>
<p>The villains and the heroes of slavery have evaporated into the misty vapors
<br>
of our past, and are now impossible to delineate clearly or bring to justice.
<br>
Trying to pay slave reparations in our current decade would, as one observer
<br>
puts it, mostly be a case of individuals who were never slaveholders giving
<br>
money to people who were never slaves. A clear absurdity.
<br>
<p>Political scientist Adolph Reed wrote recently in The Progressive that the
<br>
only certain result of a reparations program would be to &quot;produce a lively
<br>
trade for genealogists, DNA testers, and other such quacks.&quot; Even Holocaust
<br>
reparations-which are much simpler transfers directly to still-living
<br>
victims-have turned extraordinarily unseemly and debasing. As Gabriel
<br>
Schoenfeld noted recently in Commentary, &quot;In the free-for-all to obtain
<br>
Holocaust victims as clients.competing lawyers from the United States have
<br>
barnstormed across Europe soliciting clients, publicly castigating each other,
<br>
and privately maneuvering to oust their adversaries.&quot; If you think a subject
<br>
as somber as slavery wouldn't be exploited (and ultimately decay into
<br>
grasping, self-serving tawdriness) the second financial opportunism became
<br>
possible, think again.
<br>
<p>American blacks would take little solace from simply being told it's too late
<br>
for restitution, that practical impossibilities leave reparations for slavery
<br>
out of reach. But that's not the whole story. The whole truth, which ought to
<br>
offer black America real peace, is that the U.S. already made a mighty payment
<br>
for the sin of slavery. It was called the Civil War.
<br>
<p>I first decided to put together a TAE issue on this subject almost exactly two
<br>
years ago, when my hometown newspaper ran a Memorial Day ad honoring local men
<br>
who had been killed in America's wars. The ad listed the names of 85
<br>
individuals who had died fighting the Civil War. I later did some research and
<br>
discovered that the complete total for the three small towns that comprise our
<br>
local school district was 105 killed.
<br>
<p>The thing you need to know to put that figure in perspective is that our rural
<br>
village contains less than 3,000 people (and was not much different then). The
<br>
surrounding towns add a couple thousand more. For our little community to have
<br>
offered up 105 young men to be swallowed by the grave-most all of them between
<br>
18 and 29, the records show-was a great sacrifice.
<br>
<p>Cazenovia's example was not a bit unusual. In all, more than 620,000 Americans
<br>
died in the struggle to eliminate slavery. That is more than the number killed
<br>
in all of our other wars combined. It amounted to a staggering 1.8 percent of
<br>
our total population in 1865. That would be the equivalent of killing more
<br>
than 5 million young Americans today.
<br>
<p>The crux that defined and drove this ferocious fratricide was a determination
<br>
to purge ourselves of slavery. It would be hard to overstate the pain and
<br>
pathos involved in bringing that decision to its conclusion. President Lincoln
<br>
's own family is an example: No fewer than seven of his brothers-in-law fought
<br>
for the Confederacy; two were killed in battle. Yet Lincoln never wavered in
<br>
doing what was right.
<br>
<p>Though they are often now ignored, our nation is peppered with many powerful
<br>
Civil War memorials. Pictured on the next page is a monument located down the
<br>
road from my own home in New York state. Erected by a village of about 5,000
<br>
people, it hints at the magnitude of feeling which went into America's
<br>
struggle to end enforced servitude. Our nation surely did run up a &quot;debt&quot; (as
<br>
reparations advocates like Randall Robinson-who is pictured on our cover-like
<br>
to put it) for allowing black bondage. But that bill was finally paid off, in
<br>
blood.
<br>
<p>And not only in blood. After tardily recognizing their error, Americans have
<br>
tried to compensate for the historic harm visited upon African Americans. The
<br>
massive infusions of money into income support, education, and special
<br>
programs to benefit blacks that activists like Robinson are now calling for
<br>
have already been offered up. Economist Walter Williams notes that over the
<br>
last generation the American people have particularly targeted the black
<br>
underclass with more than $6.1 trillion in anti-poverty spending. Private and
<br>
governmental agencies have tried to improve black socioeconomic status with
<br>
measures ranging from affirmative action to massive philanthropic efforts. And
<br>
as our two cover essayists, John McWhorter and Deroy Murdock, point out on
<br>
pages 19-23, American blacks have made remarkable progress.
<br>
<p>But to the activists, this is not nearly enough. Perhaps there can never be
<br>
enough done to placate them, because many are driven by an implacable sense of
<br>
grievance more than a practical desire to see blacks flourish. In his book The
<br>
Debt, Randall Robinson insists that blacks do not like America, and cannot be
<br>
part of it. It's clear that is his own posture, and he actively urges other
<br>
African Americans to share it. &quot;You are owed,&quot; he tells his audience. &quot;They
<br>
did this to you&quot; (with the italic emphasis in his text).
<br>
<p>This is a poisonous political path. It will be psychologically unhealthy for
<br>
many blacks, and it is very likely to inspire a nasty backlash among other
<br>
Americans. In his thorough article on Holocaust reparations (which, again, are
<br>
far more solidly founded, because the actual victims are still with us)
<br>
Gabriel Schoenfeld points out that renewed pressure on Europeans over Nazi-era
<br>
atrocities has unleased on that continent &quot;a tide of anti-Semitic feeling
<br>
unseen since the pre-World War II era.&quot; Aggressive reparations demands have
<br>
created resentment both among intellectuals and on the streets, in the
<br>
political arena as well as in social life.
<br>
<p>Rehashing historical offenses is rarely constructive-especially since there
<br>
are so many, extending in all directions and involving all races and groups.
<br>
Despite the common references to slavery as America's &quot;peculiar institution,&quot;
<br>
the reality is that until the early nineteenth century there was hardly a
<br>
country on earth without some kind of institutionalized slavery. One of my
<br>
great-great-great-grandfathers, Mark Staggers, arrived here from England as a
<br>
&quot;bound boy&quot;-in an indentured servitude which lasted for the rest of his
<br>
childhood and much of his young adult years. My German ancestors were poor
<br>
tenant farmers-the European equivalent of sharecroppers-who were repeatedly
<br>
abused by Napoleon during the very years when U.S. slavery was at its peak.
<br>
<p>Human bondage was not an American invention, it was a condition suffered by
<br>
many people in many places across time. The northern U.S. states that outlawed
<br>
slavery were among the first governments on the globe to do so. Rather than
<br>
being some unique American stain, slavery was actually a commonplace sin, and
<br>
almost six generations have now passed since it was outlawed throughout our
<br>
land.
<br>
<p>And balancing the ugliness of historical slavery in our country is the
<br>
contemporary reality of enormous freedom and opportunity. Reparations
<br>
activists will never say it so I will: Despite some harsh imperfections,
<br>
America has, on the whole, been good to blacks, just as it has been good to
<br>
other struggling groups who washed up on these shores. As economist Williams
<br>
writes: &quot;Most black Americans are middle class. And almost every black
<br>
American's income is higher as a result of being born in the United States
<br>
than in any country in Africa.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the process of taming the wilderness, America's Anglo pioneers suffered
<br>
heavily from human cruelty, natural disaster, disease, and deprivation. Even
<br>
the most successful families sacrificed over and over. Of the 56 men who
<br>
signed the Declaration of Independence to launch America, nine died of wounds
<br>
or hardship during the Revolutionary War, five were captured or imprisoned,
<br>
many had wives and children who were killed or imprisoned, 12 had their houses
<br>
burned to the ground, 17 lost everything they owned, a number died bankrupt
<br>
and in rags.
<br>
<p>Those who followed bore other burdens. The Irish were felled in great numbers
<br>
building our first canals and railways. Southern Europeans, Asians, Hispanics,
<br>
and many other immigrants endured long indignities and drudging work helping
<br>
to civilize a new land. The American society that sprang from the hardships
<br>
endured by our ancestors now belongs to each of us-very much including blacks,
<br>
who were some of our earliest arrivals.
<br>
<p>There is no perfect accounting in the cosmos, and none of us sitting here in
<br>
twenty-first-century America really did much to &quot;deserve&quot; the prosperity,
<br>
pleasure, and long life that our country presently allows (to the great envy
<br>
of the rest of humanity). We-including those of us who are black-are just
<br>
lucky to be able to profit from those earlier sacrifices. The American
<br>
blessing is available today to every citizen, regardless of how rocky our
<br>
family's entry into the country. There is no &quot;us&quot; or &quot;them&quot; to give manna, or
<br>
take it, only a heavily interwoven &quot;we&quot; who share a common interest in the
<br>
success of our one system. The ultimate compensation America offers current
<br>
residents is a seat in the free-est and richest society yet created by man. It
<br>
's the final payment, a gift to one and all.
