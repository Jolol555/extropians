<em>&gt; What is the libertarian viewpoint on the anti-terrorist war in the US?
</em><br>
<p>As you may know, Libertarians support freedom, and the Libertarians I've
<br>
talked to recommend strong support of the US and its effort to hunt down and
<br>
punish the religious fanatics who perpetrated the September 11, 2001 act of
<br>
war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, do you think the invasion of privacy ought to be allowed if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brings benefits in the fight against terrorism?
</em><br>
<p>Invasion of privacy does not bring benefits in the fight against terrorism,
<br>
because terrorism operates openly, not privately. The purpose of terrorism is
<br>
to openly proclaim violence, with the intent to instill fear and brting about
<br>
submission. Terrorism only works when some group or organization claims
<br>
responsibility for it. Otherwise, how would the victims know who to submit to?
<br>
We know who the terrorists are. The question is how to appropriately punish
<br>
them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; how do you feel about the right to buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explosives? For example, I read that in the US you must ask the FBI for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authorization before you can buy certain nitrates for agriculture because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they can also be used to make bombs. Do you agree with this procedure or do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think the government should not interfere?
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't characterize this as interference so much as a sensible procedure
<br>
which has been inappropriately usurped by a wayward agency which would be
<br>
better put to use eliminating the Mafia, religious fanatics, and other threats
<br>
to freedom (which would require real courage) instead of pushing pencils and
<br>
shuffling paper.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
