Lee, but I wouldn't be so quick to assume that is true of all others. I, 
<br>
for one, *do* lie awake at nights worrying about exactly these sorts of 
<br>
things. How the hell are we going to get anywhere if we can't give fellow

humans a hand up out of the places they are stuck in? If we have an

enormous underclass when the spike arrives then they will hate us with a

fury.

<p>The great science fiction writer Joe Haldeman wrote a book with this very scenario!  In one scene a conference of immortals is violated by a bomb set by angry terrorists who consider them immoral.  I believe the title was _Buying Time_.

<br>
to do so.

(end)
<br>
<p>Aha, I see a future terrorist among us! Just kidding! ;)  There is a spanish science fiction film called I believe, _The Mutants_ which tells the story of a suppressed underclass of people who do not fit in with the genetically engineered and beautiful mainstream.  
<br>
<p>The film was done in an over-the-top way, but still made a strong emotional point.  A band of mutants simply want to leave the planet for space, but violence leads to even more violence as they are pursued.  
<br>
<p>This is such a common theme throughout science fiction.  I have a feeling the superwealthy immortals of the future will &quot;raise up&quot; enough people around them
<br>
so they will feel protected.  Sort of like vampire lords with their ghouls. lol  And they may not advertise who they are...

I just know that many will rush to the defense here saying that the spike will make technologies so accessible that poverty will be eliminated, but 
<br>
poverty is only part of the problem, and the spike alone won't eliminate it anyway. We have had the ability to distribute all human knowledge for free 
<br>
to all the priveleged members of society for many years now, but powerful financial pressures have prevented that from happening.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>Huh?  I don't quite understand what you wrote.  I thought the priveleged members of society had excellent access to all human knowledge!  They may have to pay for it, but they can easily afford the tuition at Yale, or wherever. lol
<br>
<p>I would say we have had the ability/possibility of distributing all human knowledge for free to the poor and disadvantaged, but the choice has been made not to.  
<br>
<p>What I would like to see is a first class public education system(k-12) and then a very inexpensive or even free college/vo-tech system.  I would tie to this computer labs for children where advanced educational software grounds them in whatever they need/want to know.   
<br>
<p>I'd like to think over the next ten or so years we will see computers/software enable disadvantaged people in preparing for educational and career success on a level never before witnessed.
<br>
<p>MIT is in the process of putting the contents of almost all their classes onto the net.  I think this is a wonderful thing so people can not only explore the topics, but &quot;wade in&quot; and see if they might ever handle the subject.
<br>
<p>One thing to remember though, even having all this knowledge online, or even offering free classes may not be enough.  As discussed here earlier, some people just do not have the intellectual power to do &quot;top ten list&quot; jobs in the information age.  Which is not to say they could at least fulfill whatever limited potential they have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So all of his wonderful speeches about &quot;benefitting

Do you have children Lee? Of course kids don't need to be helped. They

yours. Heaven forbid that anybody help anybody else.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>Ahh, but in one way or another in the econo-ecology we live in, those children(later adults) will have their effect.  Will it be positive or negative?  Strengthening for the economy or draining?  Is it easier to provide health care for children, or care for them later on when problems have taken hold and things are expensive?  And should we go with college and vo-tech, or instead opt to build even more prisons?
<br>
<p>Maybe, what Lee needs is a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; experience where he wakes up and finds himself a migrant worker with educational amnesia and lacking the hefty intellect he presently has.  Otherwise, he still remembers who he is...  Empathy is a trait some people just don't have.  Lee probably considers himself a fair man.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Nowhere is the need for children's programs more pressing than in this tiny

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here is the fatal urge.  You read about some unfortunate situation such as 
</em><br>

<p><em>&gt;Look at the words in that paragraph I snipped:  the &quot;need for children's

<em>&gt;Well, all sorts of people everywhere in the world and all throughout

Adam Smith never solved that problem. It remains in spite of many attempts

to put his beliefs into practice. He defined a narrow set of rules that 
<br>
might work fine if we were motivated by money alone... but nobody has been 
<br>
able to find that out because we aren't. Until we can formulate ways to 
<br>
manage the *real* world we have to deal with a whole mess of practical 
<br>
patches to fix a multitude of problems.
<br>
<p>It is not clean and doesn't have the crystalline beauty of a simple rule, 
<br>
but little by little humanity *is* rising to a level of intelligence and 
<br>
tolerance through an incredibly complex set of checks and balances that 
<br>
will make the spike possible. Selfishness alone won't do it.

(end)
<br>
<p>I totally agree with your analysis.  I think Max More is right in promoting the microloan programs going on in the third world.  It is an example of teaching a person how to fish instead of simply giving them a fish each day.
<br>
<p>Even singularity level technology is not a must-have to solve much of the dire poverty.  If gov'ts were not so corrupt in pocketing foreign aid money/their own gov't money meant for the poor, we would see so many lives saved.  And if we donate food and medicine we are likely to see it sold on the blackmarket where the price is way beyond what the poor can pay.  And I have not even mentioned where governments purposely starve certain populations they view as being troublemakers.
<br>
<p>Where are you Cesar Chavez when we need you again?  South America needs you!  Maybe his spirit will inspire those who could make a difference if they really struggled to do the right thing.
