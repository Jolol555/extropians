Brian Williams:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Is being in school all year necessarily best for the kids?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a good question, everyone needs a vacation.
</em><br>
<p>Hey, school in the U.S. *IS* a vacation!  I went to first and second grades
<br>
in Rio de Janeiro -and when I moved to the United States I couldn't BELIEVE
<br>
all the &quot;laffs&quot; American kids were having in school.  Our Friend the Atom.
<br>
Arithmetic Is Fun.  Halloween parades.  Art classes.  School plays.   Bake
<br>
sales and school fairs.  Watching movies.  Making Christmas ornaments (I
<br>
swear, in the 4th grade I made ornaments for a whole week in school, almost
<br>
nonstop).  All we ever did in Rio was read novels, study history and
<br>
geography, learn French, master long division by 2nd grade, and take home
<br>
loads of homework.  But what shocked me most of all was that EVERYONE in
<br>
America got promoted to the next grade (in Rio, many students were held back
<br>
if they didn't master what was taught that year).
<br>
<p>Of course, this was way back in the days before computers.  But from what
<br>
I've read and observed about American adults in general - how deep their
<br>
ignorance is when confronted with questions about geography and basic
<br>
science - I wouldn't be surprised if American schools are still lagging
<br>
behind many schools in countries we consider &quot;poor,&quot; &quot;third world&quot; or
<br>
&quot;backward.&quot;  Of course, we have compulsory education - which may partly
<br>
account for the skew.
