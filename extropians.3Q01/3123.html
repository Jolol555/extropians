I was touring Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay today and had
<br>
a hell of an idea.  Angel Island is the west coast version of Ellis Island:
<br>
they processed immigrants there.  Today the buildings are all out of
<br>
commission of course, and they have converted it all to a state park
<br>
by removing all the furnishings and glass everywhere so the visiting
<br>
proles will not damage themselves.  But the shells of the buildings are
<br>
all still there.
<br>
<p>The info posted in front of the buildings say they are over 100 years
<br>
old.  They are lying of course.  Everyone knows that buildings had not
<br>
yet been invented then, nor had islands for that matter.  Nor had spell
<br>
checkers, for in front of one had chiseled in stone &quot;Administration
<br>
Bvilding&quot;.  One would think someone would have noticed it before
<br>
it was actually put in place.  I'd like to sneak in a can of paint and put
<br>
a red zigzag line under the word Bvilding.  As everyone knows, 100
<br>
years ago humans lived in caves, tepees and yurts.  Or as some
<br>
ignorant sign painters called them, yvrts.
<br>
<p>Oh, yea, the idea:  in those vacant bvildings, we could hold a wicked
<br>
paintball match.  Of course the local authorities would likely prefer to
<br>
not have the interiors of their precious historic bvildings covered with
<br>
huge splats of paint.  So the idea is to make dry paintballs, that would
<br>
explode on impact into a cloud of dust, preferably without inflicting
<br>
unnecessary damage on the prole who just got nailed.  It would
<br>
ideally pop into dust cloud like that which results from clapping two
<br>
very dusty erasers.  Anyone remember real chalkboard erasers?
<br>
We could even make the dry paintballs out of some material that
<br>
would be devoured by the local fauna, so the greens would not
<br>
get to upset with us.  Make them with a shell like on M+Ms with
<br>
powdered sugar inside or something.
<br>
<p>Wouldn't that be cool?  We could play libertarians-from-the-left
<br>
vs libertarians-from-the-right, or pro-NMDers vs anti-NMDers.
<br>
It would help us satisfy that agressive reptilian thing we still carry
<br>
inside us as a vestigial curse from our evolutionary past.  Lets face
<br>
it, blasting away like that would create a total testosterone high.
<br>
<p>spike
<br>
<p>ps:  Anyone who wants to apply for a patent on enviro-friendly
<br>
dry paintballs, go right ahead with my blessing.  But Im pretty sure
<br>
bvildings were patented about 100 years ago.  s
