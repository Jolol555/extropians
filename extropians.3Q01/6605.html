<p>
I just happened to dig into one of the links provided by Eliezer
<br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/reports/binladen.htm">http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/reports/binladen.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p>I think it is very important that people realize how serious
<br>
this potentially is:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; February 23, 1998
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Second fatwa against the United States issued by the International Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders, a Bin Laden-led Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consortium reportedly including radical Muslim leaders from Islamic Jihad,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bangladesh, the Egyptian Al-Gama’a al-Islamiyya, and the Pakistani Ansar: 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;For over seven years the United States has been occupying the lands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Islam in the holiest of places, the Arabian peninsula, plundering its riches,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  dictating to its rulers, humiliating its people, terrorizing its neighbours,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and turning its bases in the peninsula into a spearhead through which to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  fight the neighbouring Muslim peoples .  . . .&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;  Bin Laden called upon Muslims to fight against the United States and its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  people &quot;in accordance with the words of Almighty God.&quot; (19)
</em><br>
<p>So, for people on the list who would argue moderation, one has to
<br>
recognize that &quot;war&quot; has been declared on us.
<br>
<p>Now, the article claims that bin Laden may have obtained up to 20
<br>
nuclear warheads that are being turned into suitcase bombs.  If that
<br>
is the case then it is *very, very* serious.  What is needed is
<br>
greater investigation as to the reality that the Chechnyans may
<br>
have been able to obtain these resources.  It seems somewhat implausible
<br>
because one has to ask why wouldn't they have used them against the
<br>
Russian's themselves?  (A lack of technological sophistication is one
<br>
possibility.)
<br>
<p>Now, I've been thinking about the problem of how does one track down
<br>
terrorists and it seems to me that there are approaches that have not
<br>
been used before that could be quite effective.
<br>
<p>Consider:
<br>
a) We have airplanes that can stay aloft at high altitudes almost indefinately.
<br>
b) We have small (model size) planes that are capable of self- or remote
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;navigation.
<br>
c) We have inexpensive cameras and face recognition software.
<br>
d) We can construct secure radio networks from low altitude to high altitude
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to satellites.
<br>
<p>It would seem to me that if these are combined properly, they allow you
<br>
to create a &quot;transparent society&quot; in a foreign country.  Certainly the
<br>
U.S. manufacturing capacity for small self-flying airborne &quot;spys&quot;
<br>
exceeds the ability of a nation like Afganistan to shoot these out
<br>
of the sky (I mean really -- there are limits on how many bullets
<br>
you can shoot into the sky).  The net result would be to either precisely
<br>
locate bin Laden, at which point the use of cruise missles becomes much
<br>
more effective, or drive him underground permanently (effectively
<br>
imprisoning him).
<br>
<p>Does anyone see any flaws with this type of approach?
<br>
<p>Robert
