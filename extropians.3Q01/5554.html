</em><br>
<em>&gt; *guilt* is what we should feel), adn so on.
</em><br>
<p>Well, for someone who feels pride at the fact that several hundred
<br>
thousand white men willingly gave their lives, and millions more were
<br>
disabled for life (and the impact of that upon their families), all to
<br>
free a few million blacks, I am insulted at demands for 'reparations'. I
<br>
think that it shows very high levels of ingratitude and willfull
<br>
ignorance of historical facts.
<br>
<p>Why is it, Russell, that one person's outrage at the actions of past
<br>
generations is more PC than another person's outrage at the actions of
<br>
the current generation?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have never claimed that anyone on the list is racist, but there is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unusually high level of impatience, lack of imagination (of all things!!),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lack of empathy with racial issues, for example. Why is this? I can see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing in the extropian principles that underpins it. Indeed, I don't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see how it follows from libertarianism. 
</em><br>
<p>It follows that you can't hold someone responsible for something they
<br>
didn't do. What these reparations lawyers want to do is simply to turn
<br>
anglospheric jurisprudence on its ear, to turn the world back into a
<br>
feudalistic/tribalistic forum of tit for tat vicious cycles. If
<br>
reparations are paid, who is going to administer their disbursement? The
<br>
lawyers, who will be pulling a 30% cut of the action. 
<br>
<p>Emboldened by the tobacco settlements (and enriched as well), there is a
<br>
distinct cabal of lawyers who are perpetrating class action lawsuits
<br>
using arguments so far outside the accepted standards of tort law in
<br>
many areas: against gun manufacturers and for slavery reparations
<br>
currently, with future plans to go after the entertainment industry, the
<br>
chemical, energy, and lumber industries, as well as against the auto and
<br>
software industries, which is the big piece of the pie. 
<br>
<p>They are perpetrating these suits for one reason only: greed. By
<br>
extorting hundreds of billions of dollars from many industries, they
<br>
will end up as captains of industry, a new aristocracy, reinstituting
<br>
feudalism, and maintaining power by playing the acrimony and hate of one
<br>
group against the other, keeping people divided and weak, unarmed and
<br>
powerless against tyranny.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can have all sorts of abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; views about the moral limits on government interference with &quot;rights&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without having such emotional attitudes to social tragedies such as slavery,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the destruction of non-European cultures, and the modern aftermath of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colonialism. If you are a libertarian and are sympathetic to disadvantaged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black communities (say) you'll simply have to respond with your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charitable contributions or voluntary work, for example, rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lobbying for government expenditure.
</em><br>
<p>That's right. Forcing people at gunpoint to do so is simply perpetrating
<br>
injustice, nor does it contribute to reconciliation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The tentative conclusion I coming to is that the problem is the other way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around: that (economic) libertarianism - which has *some* links with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropianism, even if only of an historical nature - is attractive to, among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others, those who already have the emotional responses I've described.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps there is a sense in which none of this matters for the cause of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism. However, I'd like to think that transhumanism can be linked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to other values that intellectually engaged and emotionally decent people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take seriously. I dread to think what impression is being created in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds of any postgraduate students - the public intellectuals of tomorrow -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who might be poring over the list's archives trying to understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism from a sociological or similar perspective. If they do come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a misconception that transhumanism is linked to inhumane attitudes, I'd say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they'd have some justification for it.
</em><br>
<p>I hope that with the 20/20 hindsight of the past, future students will
<br>
see that justice is only real if it applies equally to all, not just to
<br>
the flavor of the week, the politically correct victim of the month.
<br>
True justice only occurs when only those who are responsible pay for
<br>
their actions. Holding individuals liable who never commited any crime,
<br>
and even whose ancestors never repressed anybody, is as much a crime
<br>
against humanity as oppression that occured hundreds of years ago.
<br>
<p>Future students would also understand that in the game of blame for past
<br>
crimes, absolutely everyone is the descendant of both victims and
<br>
oppressors, that it is unfair to use any expiration date on injustice
<br>
but that of the death of the perpetrators, and that continuing to dwell
<br>
on past injustice only feeds the flames of acrimony that carry hate on
<br>
down through the ages in vicious cycles of violence. 
<br>
<p>The only real way to achieve a just world is to treat each person,
<br>
today, as a fair and equal human being, worthy of trust in the
<br>
responsible use of their individual rights if they acknowledge and
<br>
accept that responsibility, and innocent of any crimes perpetrated by
<br>
the dead voices of the past.
