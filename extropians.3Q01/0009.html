<p>
My initial impression of &quot;AI&quot; depends on which standard by which I judge it.
<br>
By the standards of typical Hollywood &quot;Sci-Fi&quot; movies, it was in the first
<br>
rank, in my book just below &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and the few such films I
<br>
can (and do) watch repeatedly.  &quot;AI&quot; is relatively self-consistent, which
<br>
puts it above the vast majority of what gets called &quot;science fiction&quot; in
<br>
Hollywood.  It also at least tries to set out moral issues that derive from
<br>
the &quot;science&quot; in a complex fashion, again something that only a very, very
<br>
few cinematic treatments of science fiction have ever done.
<br>
<p><p><p>Of course the criticisms of the scientific, technological and social
<br>
extrapolations that have already been made here are quite valid.  The
<br>
extremely uneven impact of the technology depicted is a prime example: Here
<br>
we have a society capable of creating real artificial intelligence (and I
<br>
think the generation of robots before David would definitely have to count
<br>
as such) but, other than the climactic change that provides the backdrop for
<br>
the story, we have a society that seems largely unchanged by technological
<br>
advance.  The comment that's been made about power sources is particularly
<br>
apt, as well: One of my favorite criticisms of the &quot;science&quot; of Star Wars is
<br>
to point out that in that world we see a society where every bankrupt
<br>
smuggler and marginal farmer can afford a hand-held weapon that can project
<br>
an endless series of energy streams sufficient to kill a person, but those
<br>
same people can apparently worry about where their next meal will come from.
<br>
The materials science inherent in Joe's morphing of his hair is enough in
<br>
itself to have transformed the world of &quot;AI&quot; - but apparently it is a trick
<br>
limited in application to sex bots.
<br>
<p><p><p>On an artistic level, &quot;AI&quot; is a pastiche of the two very different styles of
<br>
the men who made it.  During the movie I had to fight the impulse to play
<br>
the game of identifying which elements derived from the influence of Kubrick
<br>
and which from Spielberg.  As has been pointed out, the most obvious of
<br>
these is the contrast between the cool objective tone of the first third of
<br>
the film and the sentimentalism of the last third.  I was sorry to see that
<br>
Spielberg - who is a master of cinematic vocabulary (and made many obvious
<br>
quotations from other films) - seems to have missed entirely the chance to
<br>
pay homage to the power of Kubrick's signature symmetry of framing.
<br>
(Finding the evidence of that love of symmetry in Kubrick's work is one of
<br>
my favorite parts of enjoying his work.)
<br>
<p><p><p>On first viewing, at least, the much-anticipated blending of the styles of
<br>
Kubrick and Spielberg isn't; instead, the film has the feel of collage,
<br>
rather than collaboration.  Perhaps that is the metaphor of visual style
<br>
that should be employed to try to appreciate it.  But, if so, then my
<br>
appreciation of it as a work of art will have to await a second or third
<br>
viewing, which I will almost certainly give it.
<br>
<p><p><p>On a cultural level and with our recent discussions of the acceptance of
<br>
advancing science and technology in mind, I mark &quot;AI&quot; a success, if the
<br>
general movie-going audience will give it the attention it deserves.  In
<br>
that regard, it belongs with &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Terminator 2&quot; as
<br>
one of the few films in which the character of a sympathetic &quot;synthetic
<br>
person&quot; is offered up as the subject of a work of popular culture.
<br>
Unfortunately, Spielberg's somewhat heavy-handed sentimentality mars the
<br>
film.  Unlike with the complexity of Roy's character in &quot;Blade Runner&quot; or
<br>
the implicit handling of Ripley's attitude toward the robot in &quot;Aliens&quot; or
<br>
the evolution of the Terminator's humanity in &quot;T2&quot;, most of the moral
<br>
questions of humanity's relationship to synthetic people in &quot;AI&quot; is
<br>
heavy-handed and somewhat simplistic.  For instance, the crowd's change of
<br>
heart regarding David at the flesh fair is too simply and quickly
<br>
accomplished.  That whole sequence, which seems clearly to have been one of
<br>
the &quot;key scenes&quot; Kubrick used in his slow and methodical movie-making
<br>
technique, was treated in a much more superficial fashion than I believe the
<br>
master would have.
<br>
<p><p><p>But David's &quot;mommy's&quot; attitude toward him does begin to address this complex
<br>
issue.  That is enough to redeem the film, at least as a vehicle for
<br>
provoking a change in people's attitudes toward artificial life forms, I
<br>
think.  Spielberg leaves us to wonder about the conflict within her,
<br>
avoiding the forced exposition that mars too much of the rest of the film.
<br>
He resolves the relationship in a way to which people can, I hope, relate in
<br>
a positive emotional fashion.  If &quot;AI&quot; plants seeds with that one basic
<br>
element of its structure, then it will have been worth the attention of both
<br>
Kubrick and Spielberg.
