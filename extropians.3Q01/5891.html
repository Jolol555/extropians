Interesting post on Anarchy, the State, &amp; Memes I saw on another

<br>
Max T. O' Connor in his article Deep Anarchy referenced
<br>
below tries to make the case that the State does not exist.
<br>
His bottom line seems to be:
<br>
<p>'&quot;The State&quot; is really nothing more than statist behavior and belief - and
<br>
elements of this can be found in almost everyone. I have argued that there
<br>
is no boundary which can divide off some behavior as constituting &quot;the
<br>
State&quot; from other behavior. This point can be made more forceful by
<br>
considering the wide range of statist behavior and thinking found in society
<br>
(or &quot;society&quot;!). If it were possible to order these instances along a
<br>
spectrum we might arbitrarily draw a line beyond which we would say the
<br>
collection of behaviors was &quot;the State.&quot; However, apart from the fact that
<br>
it would be arbitrary (unlike the division of eagle parts from non-eagle
<br>
parts), there is no single dimension to be ordered into a spectrum. People
<br>
can be more or less statist at different times and in very different and
<br>
incomparable ways.'
<br>
<p>Lloyd Again:  However, this ignores the theory of memes.  Memes
<br>
are ideas that spread from one mind to another as a contagion.  These
<br>
ideas form systems...we could say, a &quot;memetic field&quot;.  Individuals in
<br>
statist memetic field consitute of State to the extent they are in
<br>
resonance with the State's memetic field.  It is a matter of degee.  QED
<br>
<p>More from Lloyd:  Strange that an extropian would forget the theory
<br>
of memes.  Memes are to Social Organisms (A State is a special type
<br>
of social organism along with ethnic groups, races, religions, etc.) as
<br>
Genes are to Biological Organisms.
