<p>A badly burned hand survives: Rare surgery puts firefighter on way to
<br>
recovery
<br>
<p>By Lisa Heyamoto
<br>
Seattle Times staff reporter
<br>
Forest firefighter Jason Emhoff's hand will be saved, and he has his abdomen
<br>
to thank for it.
<br>
<p>Emhoff, of Yakima, suffered severe burns over 30 percent of his body,
<br>
including both hands, while fighting the Thirty Mile Fire in Okanogan County
<br>
last month.
<br>
<p>The same fire killed four other firefighters - Tom Craven, 30, of
<br>
Ellensburg, and Devin Weaver, 21; Jessica Johnson, 19; and Karen
<br>
FitzPatrick, 18, all of Yakima.
<br>
<p>Emhoff's left hand was so badly burned that physicians opted to try an
<br>
unusual and infrequently used procedure that called for placing the hand
<br>
into a flap in his abdomen to generate new tissue on his knuckles.
<br>
<p>Doctors at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle did so three weeks ago,
<br>
banking on the possibility that enough new tissue would form so skin could
<br>
be grafted to the hand.
<br>
<p>Doctors took the hand from his abdomen yesterday and grafted donated skin to
<br>
it, paving the way for a permanent grafting next Monday.
<br>
<p>&quot;The surgery went fine - two thumbs up,&quot; said Dr. David Heimbach, director
<br>
of the hospital's burn unit. &quot;Jason has a great attitude and a marvelous
<br>
support group with his family. He's done extremely well.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Just three weeks ago, Emhoff, 21, could barely move his hands because of the
<br>
burns. Yesterday, he was able to use his right hand, which also was badly
<br>
burned, to sign his consent form for the surgery.
<br>
<p>The procedure takes three hours and is performed about once a year at the
<br>
Harborview burn unit.
<br>
<p>Fat and blood cells from inside his abdomen affixed themselves to the
<br>
exposed tendons still clinging to Emhoff's hand. Had doctors attempted a
<br>
skin graft without enough tissue, they could have risked failure of the
<br>
grafts to take and loss of the tendons.
<br>
<p>Doctors used donated skin for the temporary graft to save Emhoff's skin for
<br>
the permanent grafting. Emhoff has undergone some grafting on a leg and an
<br>
arm as well as on his right hand. Additional grafting will be necessary for
<br>
his ear and neck.
<br>
<p>The prospect of further time in the hospital isn't stopping Emhoff from
<br>
planning what he'll do when he gets out. First on the list? Golf, and lots
<br>
of it. And he'll be able to use both hands on that driver, doctors said.
<br>
<p>He's already feeding and shaving himself one-handed and even wrote a letter
<br>
to his brother, who lives in Brazil. He's expected to have full use of both
<br>
hands when the grafting is complete.
<br>
<p>His father, Steve Emhoff, isn't surprised at his resilience. Years of
<br>
scouting trips together taught him that his son isn't one to give up.
<br>
<p>&quot;His attitude has been so upbeat for all of this,&quot; the father said. &quot;We call
<br>
him the poster boy for the burn center.&quot;
