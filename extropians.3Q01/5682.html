<em>&gt;&gt;Now, in the future, as scientific literature hopefully becomes freer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;*and* as it becomes directly accessible by our brains, then we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;be able to think things out carefully backreferencing to the scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;literature as nessary.  And that will be a marvelous day indeed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Autonomous thinking machines of the kind that can figure things out for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves, and that can do it in  nanoseconds, increasingly outdistance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans (who remain mired in marvel). Machines have already demonstrated the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to solve problems that have stymied humans. To think for yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (autonomous thinking) means to solve problems on your own, without resorting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the literature, without looking up answers in reference books, without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using cheat sheets. To reach correct conclusions by responsive reason, rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than by reactive recitation, is the mark of intelligence, rather than the mark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of regurgitation (as in parrots and script kiddies).
</em><br>
<p><p>This reflects my ideas about &quot;intelligence&quot; as of about 1995. I was 
<br>
wrong. If &quot;intelligence&quot; is pure logic, then a perfect intelligence 
<br>
would always operate from first principles and observed fact, and never 
<br>
from pre-computed stored knowledge, which you think of as &quot;cheating.&quot; In 
<br>
the real world, intelligence is really the ability to efficiently access 
<br>
and manipulate the information you have stored. This ability to
<br>
quickly pick the correct starting points in the knowledge base minimizes
<br>
the amount of reasoning you need to do. What I really want is a &quot;perfect
<br>
search engine&quot; that will deliver relevant information and which is 
<br>
highly adaptive to current context. Such a tool would allow me to
<br>
reason from a huge knowledge base.
