<p><em>&gt; On another topic entirely, I'd like to confess sympathy with a very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  anti-extropian idea: Civilization and technology are bad and unnatural. 
</em><br>
Hehe.
<br>
<p>I'm of the opinion that mankind can not exist without technology....that 
<br>
is...that technology is part of the definition human.  Without technology we 
<br>
would not be human but merely animals.
<br>
<p>That said....those animals today that show signs of developing 
<br>
technology...ever so faintly..(I've been told by &quot;greenies&quot; that there are 
<br>
some...??) ..might be identified as &quot;pre&quot; human.  Using this definition it's 
<br>
obvious that direct genetic descent is irrelevant.  
<br>
<em>&gt; .
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I'm no longer certain that people have &quot;better&quot; lives today than they did 
</em><br>
in 
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  prehistoric times. We are not biologically adapted to the worry-prone, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  insecure, estranged lives that are part and parcel of American society 
</em><br>
today.
<br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Chronic stress, anorexia, depression, obesity--these are a few maladies 
</em><br>
that 
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  are likely much more prevalent today than in prehistoric times. Maybe the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  anarchists are onto something. 
</em><br>
<p>I can't see how early, primitive humans were any less worry prone....being 
<br>
prospective lunch for a local carnivore would tend to cause anxiety I would 
<br>
think.  And back to the earlier topic...the less  of a tech base the more 
<br>
likely to be lunch.
