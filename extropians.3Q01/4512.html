<p>I still haven't gotten a copy of the print edition of the SciAm issue
<br>
(it doesn't seem to have reached mailboxes or magazine stands here in
<br>
Seattle yet).  I'm going to be interested in seeing whether Smalley's
<br>
article expands on this in a substantive way.
<br>
<p>I'm in the middle of rereading Chapters 15-16 of Nanosystems and then
<br>
I'll probably go back thru Chapter 8 just to make sure I've got a
<br>
good feel for this.  I think the answer to this is to just use
<br>
larger subcomponents that can be grasped by fingers within the
<br>
available volume.  Its often the case in biology that one will
<br>
transfer a very small group (or atom) from one much larger molecule
<br>
to another much larger molecule.  I think the flaw in Smalley's thinking
<br>
may be that you *must* assemble things atom-by-atom.  That may not
<br>
be the case -- you can assemble things group-by-group.  I suspect
<br>
there may be a fraction of the phase space that cannot be assembled
<br>
by either strategy.  How large that fraction is would be mere speculation
<br>
at this point I suspect.
<br>
<p>While I've always been pretty optimistic about the assembly of diamondoid,
<br>
I've been much less optimistic about the assembly of sapphire --
<br>
precisely due to the problem of managing to hold Al and O atoms
<br>
in the right places.  Now assembling small Al2O3 crystals together --
<br>
that seems more feasible to me.  But that requires a very careful
<br>
exploration of the topic of nano-crystal &quot;welding&quot; -- something that
<br>
I've got very little knowledge of.
