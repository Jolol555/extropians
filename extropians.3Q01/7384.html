I think its time we returned some of our attention to the march
<br>
of technology towards goals aligned with some of our own.
<br>
<p>Prepress from Nature:
<br>
<p>==========================================================================
<br>
Transatlantic robot-assisted telesurgery
<br>
<p>Surgeons in New York have successfully used remote-controlled robots to
<br>
remove a gall bladder by laparoscopy from a 68-year-old woman in Strasbourg,
<br>
France -- the world's first transoceanic human operation. For the operation,
<br>
which lasted for under an hour and involved data transfer over a round-trip
<br>
distance of 14,000 km, the control console was linked to the robots via a
<br>
high-speed optical-fibre network which relayed information through dedicated
<br>
connections using ATM technology. 
<br>
<p>Because of the time taken for the transfer and video-coding of data,
<br>
the surgeons' movements appeared on their screens with a delay of
<br>
around 155 milliseconds, well inside the estimated safe lag time of 330 ms.
<br>
This advance should remove geographical constraints on specialized surgery
<br>
as well as help improve surgical training.
<br>
===========================================================================
<br>
<p>Think Indian surgeons doing surgeries in U.S. Hospitals.
