Hello everyone,
<br>
<p>I just wanted to update the list on how things are going with James Swayze.  His health has taken a definite turn for the worse, but he is fighting hard as usual.  
<br>
<p>I believe this Cryonet post needs to be shared here so we can all understand what James has been going through.    
<br>
<p>Funds still desperately need to be raised for his cryonics policy.  I would ask everyone to reconsider what they might be able to donate.  I have been told privately there is still a ways to go.  James has a good heart and a sharp mind which deserves this great opportunity.
<br>
<p>Donations to the James Swayze Fund can be made by check or money order sent to the Cryonics Institute, 24355 Sorrentino Court, Clinton Township MI 48035; or by credit card through Paypal at www.paypal.com, using <a href="mailto:CIHQ@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20James%20Swayze's%20health%20takes%20turn%20for%20the%20worse&In-Reply-To=&lt;DDMBPMGLFHIPLAAA@mailcity.com&gt;">CIHQ@aol.com</a> as the email address of CI.)
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John

<p>Friends,
<br>
<p>Sorry this is late. I was away getting lab work for determining if I have a UTI and
<br>
what antibiotic will kill it. Then that night I spiked a fever and could not sleep
<br>
so I missed the opportunity to say thanks to Gary on Cryonet for upping his pledge.
<br>
I did have opportunity to thank him over the phone.

<em>&gt; &gt; As one of the original pledgers [for James Swayze] I stand by my original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pledge &gt;and increase it by $1000.  I would like to be updated as to any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes in James's &gt;health in real time.
</em><br>
<p>Gary is being modest he actually is *the* original or first pledge after John Grigg
<br>
asked could anything be done for me. Then followed many others I haven't the energy
<br>
just now to look up for every one but Mike Perry and Robert Ettinger were hot on
<br>
the heels of Gary. Thanks again all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many thanks. As to James' health, unfortunately it has taken a turn for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse, and I believe Mr. Tripp has been given the details, which should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably not be made public, to preserve James' privacy and dignity,
</em><br>
<p>I've always been open about what I go through but did hesitate to just offer it up.
<br>
But since it's been mentioned I am having problems that actually are life
<br>
threatening. This will help to explain the situation and save me some typing. I
<br>
wrote this to a friend the other day.
<br>
<p>My health
<br>
<p>Well actually I'm having a problem right now that will likely land me in the
<br>
hospital this week or next. I am waiting for my doctors offices to open at
<br>
this very moment to make calls regarding this issue. For twenty years I had
<br>
an internal catheter and it caused me constant frequent urinary tract
<br>
infections because it is simply a 6 lane highway for germs to travel
<br>
straight from the surrounding environment right into my insides. Not even
<br>
practicing the most sterile of techniques does any good. Experiments in
<br>
controlled conditions have yielded infection after 72 hours even when
<br>
doctors took every precaution. I needed desperately to be able to void
<br>
without a tube inside me. However, my muscle could not relax due to the
<br>
spinal damage and even weakening it with four surgeries where it was sliced
<br>
through did no good.
<br>
<p>One day I saw a stent being placed in a man's coronary artery that had
<br>
collapsed. The stent was a mesh tube that could expand against the artery
<br>
walls and hold its expanded shape. Instantly I knew if I could get one put
<br>
into my bladder it would hold the muscle open and allow me to void using an
<br>
external or otherwise called condom catheter. I bugged my doctor about it
<br>
but he wasn't interested in experimenting. Sometime later I got deathly ill
<br>
and needed my right kidney removed to save my life. While in the hospital
<br>
still I got to talking with my diabetes doctor about my idea and he liked
<br>
it. Later by chance he became my primary doctor and when I started having
<br>
trouble again he went to another doctor with my idea and that doctor
<br>
happened to know where a third doctor, a Dr. Mayo from England but doing
<br>
research right here in my state, was actually researching my idea
<br>
independent of any knowledge of me. Or maybe my idea had gotten around but
<br>
it doesn't matter. I was able to get it done. That was two years ago and the
<br>
trouble I'm having now might be from scar tissue that tries to grow through
<br>
the mesh and close off the opening. That is called restinosis and I happen
<br>
to have another idea for fixing it which I again borrowed from heart
<br>
patients. Anyway I need to have it looked at as it is getting seriously
<br>
dangerous.

<p>Gary, I'm taking some of these but need to see what of the rest are in my multi's.

<em>&gt; I wish could be as upbeat about James' health, but as far as that goes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he's been having some problems recently.  It does not seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life-threatening, but given his already precarious condition, of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're concerned.  Apart for being quadriplegic, James also is partially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blind, has only one kidney,I believe,
</em><br>
<p>This is true and why getting UTI's is so dangerous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and suffers from diabetes.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does look as though he's going to pull through this time.
</em><br>
<p>The Jury is still out. I haven't received the lab results so no antibiotics at this
<br>
point yet. However, there is more danger in just dealing with the side effects. I
<br>
have wrote about this before, I believe, and a search through the archives for
<br>
&quot;dysreflexia&quot; should find it. Right now, until the possible restinosis is worked on
<br>
(They can't see me till Oct), I am back to the indwelling that causes so many
<br>
infections. With those there is a lot of mucous and bacteria trash that needs to
<br>
flow through the catheter unobstructed. If my bladder stretches only slightly due
<br>
to a blockage my blood pressure skyrockets immediately to around 240/110 or so and
<br>
has gotten to 300/150 just once. For you psych buffs this is Flight or Fight
<br>
syndrome gone whacky and so my adrenaline level is dangerously high and I won't
<br>
even go where that leads. You cannot imagine the headache the high pressure causes
<br>
and panic from the certainty that in the next few minutes if flow does not begin
<br>
again a stroke is most likely to result. I've had numerous temporary blockages,
<br>
alleviated by slamming my bladder with my fist to dislodge the offending matter,
<br>
and the day is not done. This is dangerous for possibly pressuring the bladder to
<br>
back flow to the kidney and bring the infection there but it's a lesser of evils
<br>
where time is of essence. I hope the doctor gets quickly onto an antibiotic early
<br>
tomorrow.
<br>
<p>My apologies for the graphic nature and off topic subject of my post. I didn't want
<br>
questions lingering. One last note, I have every confidence in CI's methods and no
<br>
reason to entertain otherwise.
<br>
<p>James
