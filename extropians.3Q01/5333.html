<p><p><em>&gt;Maybe then you can clarify the exact point in time and space that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Stock options&quot; and the days that are above the minimum were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fought for and achieved? While you at it, find out where they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forced to pay for my relocation to a new city for this job.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;What about my company bonus? When did the evil business owners
</em><br>
<em>&gt;collapse to the demands for this?
</em><br>
<p>Sure, glad to help....
<br>
<p>The shift in the time-space continuum you refereed to occurred in
<br>
Chicago on May 4th 1886.
<br>
<p>Without this occurring we probably wouldn't even have minimum wage
<br>
yet.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;Like I said, this &quot;modern labor shortage&quot; could have been reached
</em><br>
<em>&gt;MUCH earlier if the market for labor wasn't distorted by labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unions trying to artificially raise their pay rates above market
</em><br>
<em>&gt;value.
</em><br>
<p>So you said. now try applying modern economic theory and give us a
<br>
proof.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Only by controlling the supply of labor by force. What if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factory was forced to pay people 3 dollars and hour, and they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forced to do so by the union. Then here I come in. I need a job so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I tell the company Ill do the work for 2.50 and hour. The supply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just lowered the value of the labor, but wait, they cant hire me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at that rate, the union wont let them. Too bad too, the company
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had enough money budgeted in to accept me at that rate, but cant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;afford me at $3. Guess Ill just have to go tell the kids no food
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this month. If you drought this happens, look at the people
</em><br>
working &gt;in the automotive companies making 50K a year for bolting
<br>
on &gt;wheels. Now THATS insanity. The work isnt worth whats being
<br>
paid.
<br>
<p>Funny how you don't blame the company for not hiring you at $3.00
<br>
an hour when they accepted your offer at $2.50.
<br>
<p>You claim tire installers are making 50K? how about some proof, and
<br>
by the way if it wasn't worth it the company wouldn't pay it....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So lets just get them to throw a monkey wrench into the company
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machinery, that ought to help create wealth a lot. Maybe their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;related to those Luddites?
</em><br>
<p>They're on the picket line, nowhere near the machinery...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Technical shortcomings of capitalism? Like what? The fact everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wasn't millionares overnight? I hope you didnt expect capitalism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to magicially make everyone wealthy instantly, it takes time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;build trade up to the levels they are now.
</em><br>
<p><p>Like given that without government intervention companies can form
<br>
monopoly/monopsonies and completely distort the prices in a market.
<br>
<p>This has happened previously.
<br>
<p>Lets try a modern day example. Suppose Microsoft was the only
<br>
software company in the world. Do you think anyone would be getting
<br>
stock options and bonuses or relocation allowances, or would
<br>
programmers be working for minimum wage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Let me summerize this in 2 points.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1. Labor unions OR buisnesses dont controll the price of labor.
</em><br>
<p>Either a monopoly or a monopsony can control the price of either
<br>
goods or labor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;2. Distortions in the market create inefficiencies and ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt;slow down wealth creation.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, and either a monopsony or monopoly can create such
<br>
distortions.
