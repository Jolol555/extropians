<em>&gt; Researchers have found, for example, that religious people live, on
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; study done by California's respected Human Population Laboratory that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tracked 5,000 people for 28 years and found that those who  frequently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attended church were 23 percent less likely to die during the study
</em><br>
<em>&gt; period than people who didn't regularly go to church. &quot;This holds true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even controlling for the fact that religious folks tend to avoid such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors as smoking and drinking that increase the risk of disease and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death,&quot; Levin reported.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other studies have found that for each of the three leading causes of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death in the United States -- heart disease, cancer and hypertension --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who report a religious affiliation have lower rates of illness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have reported that attending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious services at least once a month more than halved the risk of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death due to heart disease, emphysema, suicide and some kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cancers.
</em><br>
<p>What I think is occuring is simply a sort of placebo effect: those who
<br>
believe they are going to live on after death are less stressed out
<br>
about dying, and stress is a known major contributor to death rates for
<br>
the mentioned maladies.
