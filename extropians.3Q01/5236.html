<em>&gt; &gt; Mike -

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This allegation that illiteracy has increased among African Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; following Brown vs Board of Education is, as well as surprising, also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; quite inaccurate. According to Arthur Hu's statistics site
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (<a href="http://www.leconsulting.com/arthurhu/index/literacy.htm">http://www.leconsulting.com/arthurhu/index/literacy.htm</a>), which I hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you find a sufficiently conservative source, illiteracy among blacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over age 14 declined from 11% to 3.6% from 1947 to 1969.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And what has occured since then, Pat? Since 1969, black illiteracy has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skyrocketed. I'm not surprised, though, this is rather typical 'cherry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picking' statistical practice. Integration wasn't even beginning to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spread widely until 1969, so using pre-1969 statistics to claim that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black illiteracy has not gone up since BvBOE is a fraudulent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presentation of facts. The facts you present, of pre-1969 data, show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that segregated educational systems were having a positive impact upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literacy among african-americans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Black illiteracy has &quot;skyrocketed&quot; since 1969? You accuse me of &quot;cherry
<br>
picking&quot; statistics, when you have presented no supporting evidence
<br>
whatsoever. This isn't a debate between liberal and conservative. It is
<br>
actually between facts and fantasy. Once again I ask you, upon what are
<br>
you basing these assertions? If you had perused my other link you would
<br>
have seen additional statistics regarding the decline in illiteracy
<br>
among African Americans during the 20th century. It is just the opposite
<br>
of what you claim. If you get a chance between posts, take a gander at
<br>
<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/naal/historicaldata/illiteracy.asp">http://nces.ed.gov/naal/historicaldata/illiteracy.asp</a>. There you will
<br>
find that from 1969 to 1979, when you say integration was beginning to
<br>
spread widely and that illiteracy was consequently &quot;skyrocketing,&quot; the
<br>
rate of illiteracy among blacks over age 14 fell by more than 50%. While
<br>
illiteracy among African Americans remains relatively high, it has never
<br>
returned to the levels experienced before school desegregation was
<br>
mandated.
<br>
<p>I am not saying that integration caused an increase in literacy.
<br>
However, your theory that racial integration resulted in an increase in
<br>
illiteracy among blacks is clearly contradicted by the evidence. If you
<br>
can prove otherwise, please present your data.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
