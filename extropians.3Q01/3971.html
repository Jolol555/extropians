<em>&gt;The real problem with Microsoft is that their e-mailer automatically runs

</em><br>
<em>&gt;on different PCs from a central location without bothering to include any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;security to make sure the instructions come from a trusted source.
</em><br>
<p>Yes MS's Outlook email program is a major problem (though not the only one) 
<br>
but deciding on whether the item comes from a trusted source is not the 
<br>
solution as most recent viruses use MS Outlook to email themselves to the 
<br>
people in the Outlook address book. This means that the most dangerous 
<br>
attachments can easily come from people you know and trust.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I disagree with Cringely that allowing access to raw sockets is dangerous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;All this means is that networking software is easier to write under Windows.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Instead of limiting network access to secret system calls that only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Microsoft engineers know, they are now allowing other software vendors to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;write networking code for Windows.  This will allow new network software to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be written.  Some of this software may be in the form of viruses or worms.
</em><br>
<p>It is already not terribly difficult to write networking software on a 
<br>
Windows PC without access to raw sockets. As I understand it, raw sockets 
<br>
give the programmer control over every aspect of the packets they send. At 
<br>
the moment if you want to send, say, a UDP packet then the operating system 
<br>
makes it easy for you to do that; it creates the headers for you and you 
<br>
just give it the data you wish to stick in it. Raw sockets give you the 
<br>
ability to forge the headers so that you can make it look like your packet 
<br>
came from anywhere, for example from Harvey Newstrom's IP address. This is 
<br>
a real worry when they start doing very illegal things.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&lt;snip&gt; We already have this ease of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;network programming on Macintosh, OS/2, Linux and other Operating Systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Only Microsoft had previously tried to block programmers from accessing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their own PCs.  We haven't seen those other platforms becoming hacker
</em><br>
<em>&gt;favorites.
</em><br>
<p>MS machines are so insecure that blocking people from raw sockets is a good 
<br>
idea. If they became as secure as Linux machines then most of this problem 
<br>
would evaporate. Random programs are not allowed access to raw sockets on 
<br>
Linux, from what I understand -- they need super-user (root) status. I 
<br>
don't know enough about the Mac and OS/2 to be able to comment on them.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;There is nothing really new in Microsoft XP that hackers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't already have if they wanted.
</em><br>
<p>Every XP machine that is open to the net without adequate virus/worm/trojan 
<br>
protection becomes a potentially untraceable source of Denial Of Service 
<br>
flooding via zombies using forged headers. (Read <a href="http://grc.com/dos/">http://grc.com/dos/</a> for 
<br>
information on why WindowsXP is a special security concern and particularly 
<br>
<a href="http://grc.com/dos/grcdos.htm">http://grc.com/dos/grcdos.htm</a> for a vivid understanding of the zombie danger.)
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;&lt;snip&gt; This system [universal ID]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is already in place.  Hackers may be able to work around this system or any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;new system of identification.
</em><br>
<p>OK. Burglars can get around any security system. Do you leave your front 
<br>
door unlocked or open when you go away on holidays? Why not?
<br>
<p>It is the same with security on PCs. You can give up on security and make 
<br>
it easy for every idiot script kiddie, or you can progressively lessen the 
<br>
danger. You Yanks have a saying, that the price of freedom is eternal 
<br>
vigilance. That is very true in this case.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Besides any hacker that we are trying to restrict could hack their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machine's security to get access to their own hardware.
</em><br>
<p>But they don't, and that is precisely the point. They *could* even write 
<br>
their own comms from scratch and have access to their own raw sockets, but 
<br>
they don't, because most of them are vandal twits with less than half a 
<br>
brain to share between them. (I speak of crackers -- not hackers. Hackers 
<br>
are wonderful people that we owe the entire net and much of our computer 
<br>
architecture to.)
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;Cringely's call for new protocols, APIs, interfaces and the like are silly.
</em><br>
<p>You have misread his article. He is actually arguing against new protocols. 
<br>
He wants us to make better use of what we have now. He makes no suggestions 
<br>
for new APIs or interfaces.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
