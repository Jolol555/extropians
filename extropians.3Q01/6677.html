<p>If you want to, Natasha, we could try to improve the Transhumanist FAQ (the 
<br>
existing one, at <a href="http://www.transhumanist.org/">http://www.transhumanist.org/</a>). I know you were kind 
<br>
enough to send me some comments on especially the arts and culture sections 
<br>
some time back, which I told you would be considered in a future update. I 
<br>
haven't got around to it because I've been focusing on other things and 
<br>
because I wouldn't want to make any substantial changes to the text without 
<br>
going through the same wonderful collaborative process that led to the 
<br>
original (and there are translations that would also have to be updated, so 
<br>
it's a bit of an undertaking for many people). Yet, a good start may be if 
<br>
you would post a summary of the inconsistencies you see so that we could 
<br>
have an open discussion about that. If there appear to be serious 
<br>
shortcomings, we could then all get together and try to work out something 
<br>
better.
