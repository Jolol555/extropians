Sorry about the length of this post i hope it's worth it, please persevere.  :)

<em>&gt;  Some more or less random thoughts on the events of yesterday.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On the technical/security side:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I think the risk of a repeat attack using the same methods by the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;group or similar ones is very low.  The 9/11/01 attacks have put a spotlight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the gaping security holes that the attackers were able to exploit and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those holes will now be plugged.  The cost of plugging them WILL likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bankrupt a number of airlines, though and, in that, the terrorists will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;secured yet another victory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The clues now coming to light will probably provide sufficient leads that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the surviving members of the cabal that perpetrated the crimes will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;identified fairly quickly.  I'm guessing that the perpetrators didn't try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cover their tracks very hard.  However, I'll bet that the links to bin-Laden
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be tenuous at best, but nevertheless real.  The scenario I now think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most likely is that bin-Laden's core leadership cell only generally defined
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the target and methodology and then severed connections to the action cells
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that carried out the attacks under separate and autonomous leadership.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most direct connections will be through funding.  Most like scenario there:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Autonomous funds set up and access granted ahead of time to the action
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cells, with further contact between the funds and bin-Laden severed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I've said for years that civil aviation provides one of the primary weapons
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to terrorists seeking to attack the US.  I took no comfort from being proved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right yesterday as I watched the second impact on the WTC in real-time.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only hope that those whose job is security will be thinking about the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scenarios I've imagined.  I won't even describe them here, but they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obvious enough to anyone with half a brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On the political/security front:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I do expect further attacks from similar autonomous cells, invigorated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the &quot;success&quot; of the events of 9/11/01.  Thus, we're likely to see a much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increased impact of security behavior in our lives from now on.  I think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fears about this triggering a &quot;police state&quot; are overblown.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;My father's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generation went through the years of World War II with their basic civil
</em><br>
<em>&gt;liberties intact, although temporarily and modestly curtailed during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actual conflict.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmmmmm i know a few US citizens of Japanese origin who would seriously
<br>
question this assumption.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The diffuse nature of the threat makes comparisons to WWII
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difficult, though.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On the political/cultural front:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The irony of calling on god - the nearly universal reaction of America's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political leaders - was completely lost on the media.  NONE of the talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heads on the tube noted it.  Oh well . . .
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The root problem is not US foreign policy, as some here have suggested.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed this is true US foreign policy is THE root cause ( personally am not 
<br>
sure
<br>
there is ONE root cause ). IMHO though it is certainly one of the main 
<br>
branches.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's that there is a widely distributed culture of fanaticism in the Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world.  It focuses on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but it certainly has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other objects, as well.  Consider that the savagery of the Taliban has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;basically nothing to do with the on-going crisis in the Levant.  Examples
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can be found from Algeria to Indonesia that have nothing to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Palestinian nationalism.  That culture of fanaticism has secured the &quot;sacred
</em><br>
<em>&gt;high ground&quot; throughout the Islamic world.
</em><br>
<p>Here i have to agree whole heartedly with Greg, yes Islam is intolerant, 
<br>
aggressive
<br>
and some parts of it are fanatical. But lets not forget Christianity was 
<br>
once like this
<br>
a some sections of it still are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As a result, there is no secure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;middle ground in politics or culture in the Islamic world.  This is because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Islamism is truly totalitarian, or &quot;culturally hegemonistic,&quot; to borrow a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phrase form Marxist rhetoric, i.e. it makes claim to relevance to and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dominance over every aspect of life.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Contrary to the claims of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Arab-Americans and others today, and in the days that follow, that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;9/11/01 attacks don't represent &quot;true Islam&quot;, in fact they do.
</em><br>
<p>hmmmm really think you should have had a &quot;IMHO&quot; attached to this, since as
<br>
far as i am aware the Koran does not really endorse in it's many of the 
<br>
acts committed
<br>
in it's name.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;They
</em><br>
<em>&gt;represent precisely the aspects of Islam that made it the most successfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt;viral meme in human history.
</em><br>
Think it's important to remember that all Religions are viral meme's. But 
<br>
some have been
<br>
considerably softened over the years by their population base. ( I'll 
<br>
expand on  this issue below )
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And herein lies the ultimate, gut-wrenching irony and threat: Our political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and cultural leaders cannot condemn this root cause of the problem.  On the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one hand, it would likely be ineffective.  Condemnation of Islamism would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpreted by Moslems all over the world as the simple rhetoric of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inter-religious bigotry and ompetition.
</em><br>
<p>Of course how would you react if a Muslim dominated world told you to your 
<br>
face that
<br>
a large portion of your culture was inherently flawed
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In other words, condemning Islam
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for what it is would be heard by Moslems as the same kind of rhetoric that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has fueled inter-religious wars throughout history, no different than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kind of pronouncements made by leaders on both sides of the European
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religious wars of the Reformation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On the other hand, the modern dogma of cultural relativism makes any kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;public judgment of one culture by another impossible.  Any condemnation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Islam for the fertilizer of fanaticism that it is would be interpreted by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the shapers of our own culture as chauvinism.
</em><br>
<p>There are various historic reason for this, not least the fact that so 
<br>
called &quot;inferior cultures&quot;
<br>
have in the past been hugely exploited and oppressed. The aftermath leaving 
<br>
the world with many of
<br>
the enormous and varied problems seen in Africa, South America, and many 
<br>
other parts of the
<br>
developing world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Thus, our public discourse is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;condemned to a fundamental impotence: We cannot as a civilization even TALK
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about the root cause of the problem.
</em><br>
Are you sure you want to find solutions rather than merely be allowed to 
<br>
condemn, here Greg.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I wish I could offer a solution . . .
</em><br>
Ok now here i may be able to make some suggestions, which i'd like ppl to 
<br>
examine and expand or
<br>
comment on.
<br>
In order to fully make my point i need to delve into my own rather unusual 
<br>
upbringing.
<br>
<p>I was born in 1965 in Halifax a small town in Yorkshire in the North of 
<br>
England, approximately
<br>
three weeks later my mother committed suicide.
<br>
( most likely a cause of post natal depression little understood in those 
<br>
days )
<br>
I was taken into local authority care and placed with a local foster family.
<br>
With whom i lived out a completely normal childhood, having been made an 
<br>
integral
<br>
and completely normal member of their family.
<br>
The only element of this situation that to a casual observer of my family 
<br>
would have seemed
<br>
strange. Is the fact that i am black my birth parents came from the West 
<br>
Indies, thats the
<br>
Caribbean for all you colonials :)
<br>
My foster parents were ( now sadly both deceased ) ordinary working classed 
<br>
white Yorkshire folk,
<br>
who i can only describe as working classed, common sense, rationalists, &quot;a 
<br>
spade is a spade&quot; type folk.
<br>
No pun  intended.
<br>
For the largely American list members, if you have seen &quot;Last of the summer 
<br>
wine&quot; then that is
<br>
pretty much exactly cultural matrix i grew up in. My Dad wore flat caps and 
<br>
often said &quot;eyh by gumb&quot;
<br>
whilst my Mom wore pinafores and often went to bed in rollers :) I kid you not.
<br>
So as am sure you can imagine i grew up within a primarily Yorkshire 
<br>
cultural matrix. As a child
<br>
i had few contacts who shared my ethnicity. Despite being the only black 
<br>
kid in my junior
<br>
school and one of only six black kids in high school, i suffered almost no 
<br>
racial problems at all throughout
<br>
my entire childhood.( many find this surprising )
<br>
As a result of this at 36 am still quite happy to think of myself as a 
<br>
Yorkshire lad, first and foremost.
<br>
Not a person of colour, not a black guy, or a West Indian. This is not to 
<br>
say i don't consider myself black,
<br>
of course am black, but to me my ethnicity is a secondary element of who i 
<br>
am, almost incidental.
<br>
<p>Sorry about the length of this but it's essential for you to get an 
<br>
accurate picture of my cultural background,
<br>
i am almost done.
<br>
<p>As a got older left school and attended sixth form college, i made more 
<br>
friends who shared my ethnic
<br>
background. And have been dismayed to find in many cases a willingness in 
<br>
many of my friends to interpret the
<br>
smallest slight, and any form of rejection, as racially motivated.
<br>
Now i wrestled for a long time with just what was the root cause of this 
<br>
difference.
<br>
<p>Had i been made insensitive to racial slights by my background, apparently 
<br>
not. Since i do on occasions detect
<br>
pretty obvious hostility from some ppl, that has a particular interpersonal 
<br>
flavour all it's own, that i interpret as racist.
<br>
<p>Was i more willing than my friends to extend the benefit of the doubt to 
<br>
strangers, in circumstances that could
<br>
that could easily be misinterpreted. Almost certainly.
<br>
I also take the attitude that minor acts of bigotry that are not direct and 
<br>
obvious do me little harm, and allow me to retain my
<br>
mental and spiritual energies for more important tasks.
<br>
<p>Were many of my friends sensitive almost hyper-sensitive in some cases to 
<br>
any kind of slight or rejection, and often
<br>
ready to assume someone was racist on extremely tenuous evidence. sadly i 
<br>
have to say yes.
<br>
<p>Once I'd put these threads together with some observations of the group 
<br>
dynamic that developed when
<br>
in a larger black group 6-7+. I came to some surprising conclusions. I 
<br>
realized that it was the
<br>
different cultural matrix that me and my friends had grown up in that made 
<br>
that difference in perspective.
<br>
I did not expect racism from strangers because 1. i had not been raised to 
<br>
expect it. 2. because i had,
<br>
had little past experience of it.
<br>
<p>Now am pretty sure that the process of socialization experienced by many 
<br>
Muslim kids from
<br>
poor and deeply religious backgrounds is similar yet more extreme, to that 
<br>
experienced by many
<br>
of my friends. Young Muslim kids in some communities are raised to expect 
<br>
American abuse, as
<br>
such the slightest mistake of presentation or policy causes a far more 
<br>
extreme reaction than
<br>
reasonable. Christianity was for want of a better term &quot;tamed&quot; we need a 
<br>
non-confrontational strategy
<br>
to do the same thing with Islam.
<br>
<p>Perhaps this is the area that could be addressed and where serious useful 
<br>
changes could be made.
<br>
This kind of approach would perhaps have a long time scale since it's main 
<br>
targets would essentially
<br>
be the next generation of bombers. But maybe not after all, how many times 
<br>
could a Muslim father
<br>
leave his home to cause mayhem with the disapproving looks of his children 
<br>
to comfort him.
<br>
What ways can be found to essentially indoctrinate Muslim kids &quot; most 
<br>
likely at risk&quot; in broad minded,
<br>
liberal tolerance. ( maybe even Extropian values )
<br>
Of course am not advocating overt indoctrination, this would be seen as 
<br>
threatening, am advocating
<br>
something much more subtle than that. :)
<br>
<p>We probably all remember Gregs post about the young Indian boys future 
<br>
reading habits
<br>
and the broad response it brought. It seemed almost everyone wanted to help 
<br>
make the kids
<br>
literary experiences rich and positive. Maybe we can put our heads together 
<br>
and come up
<br>
with suggestions that could have a real impact. After all what could be a 
<br>
greater Extropian
<br>
project than the creation of an Extropian generation.
