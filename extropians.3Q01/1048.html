<p>It is not &quot;simply&quot; any such thing.  What is so physical about a
<br>
Matrioska brain that figures out how to recast at the femto
<br>
level or finally manages to fully controll and step around
<br>
space-time at will? At the least, it is a very different
<br>
&quot;materialism&quot; than most think about.  That sort of Mind, acts
<br>
continuously to increase the utter subservience of the material
<br>
to the conscious and intellectual.  Some consider this in terms
<br>
of spirit growing out of and utterly triumphing over the
<br>
material.  At the least I would think that you can agree this is
<br>
no simple retreat or defense mechanism.  It is a casting of what
<br>
we are about in different and perhaps more fruitful terms.

<p>Do you think that applies to people like me?

<p>The universe wondrously gives birth to us and is contained
<br>
within us, apprehended by us and we and the universe transform
<br>
together.  Our landscape is full of gopher holes.  Especially we
<br>
a Singularity we cannot even imagine or begin to grok staring us

in the face.
