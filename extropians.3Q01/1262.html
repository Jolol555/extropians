Hi all,
<br>
<p>Here's an interesting experiment in telepresence, using wired up humans
<br>
rather than robots (so I wasn't talking out of my backside re: telepresence
<br>
agents after all :-)
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.tele-actor.com">http://www.tele-actor.com</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;The Tele-Actor is a skilled human equipped with a wireless camera who moves
<br>
through and interacts with a live remote environment. Camera images are
<br>
broadcast over the Internet to online participants, who interact by voting
<br>
with a new interface. 
<br>
&quot;The Tele-Actor system combines two ideas: (1) a human Tele-Actor who is
<br>
more agile than a robot, and (2) collaborative control, which allows many
<br>
people to simultaneous participate over the Internet. &quot;
<br>
