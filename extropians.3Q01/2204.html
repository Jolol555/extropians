<em>&gt; I can't believe you say this.  Here in Florida we sometimes have pollution

</em><br>
<em>&gt; on shore.  We have bacteria blooms.  We have fish kills.  It is the ocean
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Oh.  OK I stand corrected.  {8-]
<br>
<p>I dont think tar balls belongs on this list, however.  Tar is a natural
<br>
substance.
<br>
I have seen those, but I dont think they are related to drilling.  Are they?
<br>
<p>Speaking of political influence, I cut out an ad in the local paper begging
<br>
people to check and possibly replace the flapper valve in their toilets, for
<br>
if they leak, then all that fresh water will be dumped into the sewer system
<br>
and that will be dumped into the San Francisco Bay, which reduces the
<br>
salinity of the delicate salt water marsh ecosystem, endangering some
<br>
wading bird or other somehow.  Im not making this up.
<br>
<p>I guess the folks that wrote that ad wont like my idea for soaking up
<br>
some of that baaaad CO2: by rerouting water from the Columbia out
<br>
to the grassy western U.S. plains to grow vast forests out there.  Seems
<br>
like all we really need is water in the west to do that.  Currently
<br>
we are throwing all that good fresh water into the sea.  Wouldnt that
<br>
work, assuming there really is too much CO2?  In fact, it seems if we
<br>
put our minds to it, we could figure out a way to store enough water
<br>
inland to lower sea levels enough to simultaneously take the pressure
<br>
off the Holland, Venice and the island nations that built on low land
<br>
to start with, and raise the global temperature at the same time, to
<br>
salvage some of that good Siberian land the commies are wasting
<br>
currently.  spike
