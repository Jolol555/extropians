<em>&gt; A rationalist cannot debunk religion with the scientific method any more
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; will recognize or accept the other's methods.  They are mutually exclusive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neither side will accept the debunking by the other, while both sides will

</em><br>
<p>No, a rationalist *can* debunk religion by exposing its
<br>
falsehoods (and a preacher *can* condemn science by appeals
<br>
to scripture).
<br>
<p>Yes, neither will *immediately* recognize or accept the other's
<br>
methods, but everyone's mind is a disputed ground for memes.
<br>
You can indeed create doubt in people's minds, despite their
<br>
outward behavior.  Sometimes the doubts grow like seeds over
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>But it's not the dyed-in-the-wool religionist that we are 
<br>
trying to persuade.  There are a lot of people who are
<br>
more susceptible to open inquiry.
<br>
<p>But more important than that is simply to fearlessly state
<br>
and know the truth.  It's the key to success of an open
<br>
society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Neither side will accept the debunking by the other,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while both sides will go on to believe they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrated the obvious truth.
</em><br>
<p>Why isn't your voice of reason heard taking a stand, here?
