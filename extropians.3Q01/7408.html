<p>Welp, &quot;[Chicken!]&quot;, even with whatever that one-eyebrow-up face was after it,
<br>
didn't hit me as anything except &quot;If your beliefs and actions don't match mine,

<p>&quot;Is this argument necessary?&quot; Belly right up to the bar and make yourself heard.
<br>
The place isn't mine to offer; it's yours to take. 
<br>
<p>My word, _I_ won't ever use the word &quot;godless&quot; as an insult, and if it comes to 
<br>
a point where the term gets back into common parlance (as it was back in the 
<br>
1950s--&quot;Those Godless Commies!&quot;--that'll be a different matter. In degree, anyway.
<br>
<p>What I meant by a sheaf of strategies is &quot;_You_ don't-worship _your_ way, and 
<br>
_I'll_ not-worship _mine_&quot;. Some people need to hear from each of us. Go ahead
<br>
and complain. I wasn't saying you shouldn't.
<br>
<p>More than once, I have struck some religeuse as &quot;awfully nice for someone who hasn't
<br>
found Christ.&quot;
<br>
<p>I always reply &quot;I think God has uses even for the un-Saved.&quot; The smart ones smile.
