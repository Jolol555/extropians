<p>
&quot;I'm no fan of public education.  Particularly the LAUSD and I'd rather eat 
<br>
worms than send my kids to public school in L.A.  But there is a *large* 
<br>
segment of society that cannot afford to pay for the education of their 
<br>
kids.&quot;
<br>
<p>But that is mainly because right now they are a status issue more then
<br>
anything else.  The charter schools, like Edison, go into public schools
<br>
with the same budget the public school had and privatize it.  Private dont
<br>
have any initiate to compete for average students of average income because
<br>
they just go to public schools.  The average public school education costs
<br>
about $7,000 per year per student, as opposed to $4,000 for an average
<br>
private school.  Yet parents who send thier children to private schools pay
<br>
both those fees.  The public school systems have no incentive to run things
<br>
more effeciently or cheaper, as with most government programs.  For examply,
<br>
from what I have read less then 40% of the money that goes into public
<br>
welfare gets to the the recepients.  Private charities average around 70 -
<br>
80%.  Big difference.
