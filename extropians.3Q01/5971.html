<p>That is up to all of us.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Actually, it is quite possible they might try to license some
<br>
forms of technology (but mostly hardware at first) and poison
<br>
the well against business use of non-licensed technology.  The
<br>
high profile arrests that generate no more protests than we've
<br>
seen lately will make the government ever more bold and the
<br>
people ever more cowed.

<em>&gt; They are NOT going to require licenses on software engineers. Industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would squeal loudly, and THEY have the lobbying power to succeed in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protest. This will be just like the visas fro foreign born engineers thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few years back - US engineers were almost unanimous in opposition to more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visas being issued, but the corporations wanted the cheap workers, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Congress obliged.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There has been considerable talk of licensing software engineers
<br>
for quite some time.   This is another nudge in that direction. 
<br>
Personally, this software engineer was never against more
<br>
software visas to foreign born software engineers.  Many of the
<br>
best engineers I know and quite good friends are here on those
<br>
visas.  And I know that finding really good software talent is
<br>
very difficult and that even the worldwide pool is not
<br>
sufficient to demand.  At least it isn't when the economy hasn't
<br>
been accidentally/on purpose wrecked thus slowing the advance of
<br>
technology, sowing fear and insecurity among the technical
<br>
literate and hobbling the beast so government/industry can try
<br>
to break it to the saddle.
