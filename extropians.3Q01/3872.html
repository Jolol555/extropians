<p><em>&gt; If what you are looking for is to experience social

</em><br>
<p>No thats not it at all.  Last time this came up, some suggested
<br>
I dress up as a woman, but that misses the point entirely.  In fact,
<br>
I would be quite squicked by that whole ordeal, as well as feel silly
<br>
as hell.  No, Im not looking for *any* social interaction from
<br>
a woman's point of view: Im hetero to the bone.
<br>
<p>What I *would* like to do is be able to *see* the world thru
<br>
a woman's eyes.  Just for one week.  If I were to devour a
<br>
handful of birth control pills, would I learn what it feels like
<br>
to have PMS?  Would I see more colors?  Would I lose the
<br>
urge to click thru all the channels and would I lose the urge
<br>
play the air-guitar every time I hear Mark Knoffler?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you are interested in experiencing the emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and mental changes caused by an estrogen dominate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endocrine system as opposed to a testosterone one, you
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>And reversibly?  Would I lose my sex drive temporarily?
<br>
I dont care if I get sterile, especially if it is reversible.
<br>
Obviously I would not want to lose the old sex drive tho.
<br>
My notion is that I would be a better companion for
<br>
my chosen female wife, if I could only understand what
<br>
she is seeing.
<br>
<p>Observation:  for some reason which I have never
<br>
understood, women seem to grok men's feelings
<br>
better than men grok women's feelings.  Loree, someone
<br>
who has been both may have a unique insight on this.
<br>
Anyone else is welcome to comment on this observation.
<br>
Does it ring true to you?  I figure if I gave myself a dose
<br>
of estrogen, I could be as empathetic as she is.
<br>
<p>What is gynecomastia?  spike
