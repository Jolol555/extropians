<em>&gt; But I *am* getting impatient with the use of the word &quot;liberal&quot; (in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of social democrat/ic) as one of abuse. The way this is done, day in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day out, suggests that some people here believe that liberal ideas in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense are somehow contrary to extropianism or to transhumanism or to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list's traditions and are illegitimate on this list.
</em><br>
<p>Ideas that are good enough to have persuaded _you_ of their worth ought to be
<br>
good enough to stand on their own ('cause your a savvy guy), without being
<br>
bolstered by association with social democrat/ic politics. What makes an idea
<br>
a &quot;liberal&quot; idea, as opposed to being an idea that promotes health,
<br>
prosperity, beauty, freedom, practicality, excellence, and competence? AFAIC,
<br>
really good ideas transcend the left/right, liberal/conservative dichotomies,
<br>
so calling an idea &quot;liberal&quot; is no worse than calling one &quot;conservative.&quot;
<br>
Either label is inappropriate for transhumans because they've gotten beyond
<br>
that stage.
<br>
<p>For example, teaching kids science is a good idea (as long as it's not
<br>
&quot;political&quot; science, which is a self-contradictory term), and it gets even
<br>
better when it's taught without polluting it with any political labels
<br>
whatsoever, including liberal, conservative, socialist, libertarian,
<br>
anarchist, or zenarchist.
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
