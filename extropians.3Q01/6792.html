Subject: The Enduring Power of Stupidity
<br>
<p>The Enduring Power of Stupidity
<br>
<p><p>During the past five days I have read many essays. To me, all
<br>
of them have missed a fundamental underlying point.
<br>
<p>There are two basic forces in the world: Intelligence and
<br>
stupidity. Human intelligence generally is creative, and has
<br>
the potential to enhance our lives. Stupidity almost always
<br>
is destructive.
<br>
<p>A month ago, the power of stupidity was demonstrated on a
<br>
routine basis when our president made an &quot;ethical decision&quot;
<br>
that scientists should destroy small clumps of human cells by
<br>
throwing them away, instead of using them in research to
<br>
eradicate terrible diseases. This stupidity was justified by
<br>
misinterpreting an archaic book of primitive myths.
<br>
<p>During the half-century that I have been alive, I've seen
<br>
many similar examples of stupidity depriving us of the fruits
<br>
of intelligence. Random examples include the misapplication
<br>
of Marxism, the Vietnam war, the cold war, dismantling the US
<br>
manned space program, eco-alarmism, and the war on drugs.
<br>
<p>No doubt every person has some favorite examples to add to
<br>
this list.
<br>
<p>At the dawn of the 21st century, when Y2K was averted by a
<br>
lot of smart people doing intelligent things to prevent the
<br>
paralysis of modern society, I started to hope that
<br>
intelligence was finally gaining an edge over stupidity. Here
<br>
I am now, using a digital computer that not only facilitates
<br>
my creativity as a writer, but also revolutionizes my ability
<br>
to create music, videos, or graphics. Its connectivity has
<br>
changed my entire working and social life. Its power has been
<br>
almost totally beneficial, and it promises still greater
<br>
benefits in the future.
<br>
<p>Computational molecular biology has the potential to
<br>
eradicate all hunger and disease. Ultimately computational
<br>
power should enable us to manipulate matter itself, enabling
<br>
a new era of unlimited wealth while eliminating side effects
<br>
such as pollution and global warming. We may also defeat
<br>
death: I may die, but I believe my daughter has a chance to
<br>
achieve biological immortality.
<br>
<p>At least, I used to believe this, until last Tuesday. On
<br>
Tuesday I saw that stupidity still trumps intelligence. Those
<br>
hijacked airplanes were an amazing feat of intelligent
<br>
engineering, making the miracle of flight not only safe but
<br>
universally accessible. The World Trade Center was a
<br>
brilliantly innovative piece of architecture. Yet a handful
<br>
of thugs armed with box cutters destroyed those fruits of
<br>
intelligence within a few hours. The thugs, of course, were
<br>
acting in accordance with their stupid misinterpretation of
<br>
yet another archaic book of primitive myths.
<br>
<p>Regulatory stupidity facilitated the terrorist acts.
<br>
According to the Washington Post, FAA regulations have always
<br>
permitted knives up to 4 inches long on domestic flights, and
<br>
all cockpit doors on all airplanes can be opened with the
<br>
same master key. In any case, the doors are flimsy enough to
<br>
be kicked open. At least 14 times since 1998, drunk or
<br>
disturbed passengers have tried to force their way into
<br>
airplane cockpits. They succeeded on 6 occasions. In 1999, a
<br>
passenger on All Nippon Airways fatally stabbed a pilot.
<br>
<p>Thus, this country has pursued an aggressive, punitive
<br>
foreign policy that was guaranteed to create enemies, yet
<br>
took only cosmetic steps to protect its own citizens in a
<br>
situation of notorious vulnerability. Worse, in the future,
<br>
passengers will remain vulnerable (instead of being allowed
<br>
access to tools of nonlethal self-defense such as tasers),
<br>
while the foreign policy will become more aggressive, thus
<br>
creating still more enemies.
<br>
<p>I'm old enough to remember how the unfettered, turbulent
<br>
creativity of the 1960s dissipated in the ugly stupidities of
<br>
a war in southeast Asia. I fear now that the incredible
<br>
technological creativity of the past decade may be derailed
<br>
by some equally stupid, unwinnable war in another remote,
<br>
hostile country, causing socioeconomic chaos at home.
<br>
<p>I feel a great, overwhelming melancholy. The wonderful smart
<br>
innovations in the past decade have empowered us in so many
<br>
ways, yet we are still impotent compared with the techno-
<br>
illiterates who claim a mandate to act stupidly on our
<br>
behalf.
<br>
<p>The terrorists with box cutters, and the militants in the
<br>
U.S. government, share two traits. They exercise power
<br>
indiscriminately, and show no great love for technology. In
<br>
fact, I believe they are hostile to it because they see how
<br>
its intelligence threatens them.
<br>
<p>Their fear is justified. In the long term, I still believe
<br>
that technology will eclipse dumb political power and render
<br>
it obsolete.
<br>
<p>Alas, I no longer believe that I will see this happen within
<br>
my lifetime.
<br>
