<p>Hmmm, perhaps there is another term besides introvert/extrovert.
<br>
I always come out on the introverted side on that test, INTP, but
<br>
I also figure that if we manage uploading, every memory and perhaps
<br>
every thought one ever had could be examined by someone, perhaps
<br>
everyone.  In that case, excess dedication to privacy could cause one
<br>
to reject the notion of uploading, resulting in their every thought and deed
<br>
to perish at the end of their short earthly existence.  Similarly, there are
<br>
many potential rocket scientists who refuse to take the tests required
<br>
for clearances because they cant get past the whole idea of confessing
<br>
every single naughty thing they ever did.  There are plenty of really
<br>
good, interesting, funny autobiographies that were never written, for
<br>
all the same reasons.  I say to hell with privacy (my own, not other
<br>
people's).  Dont flinch, dont blush, live open, upload, share the files
<br>
with anyone who cares to read them.  spike
