Lee wrote a fascinating autobiographical account concluding
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'd be interested in anyone else's narrative of how they came to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;acquire their early, decisive beliefs.
</em><br>
<p>I've already done this in my post somewhere in the archives where I descibed 
<br>
how I lost my Christian faith, essentially over the Problem of Evil (though 
<br>
a lot of other issues converged for me) while I was Vice-President of the 
<br>
Evangelical Union on my campus.
<br>
<p>If there is any doubt, I wish to make clear that I am also a scientific 
<br>
materialist (among other positions I take, such as legal positivism).
<br>
<p>However, I don't understand how scientific materialism is supposed to entail 
<br>
what I understand to be the pattern theory of *identity*. Parfit, for 
<br>
example, needs a lot more premises than scientific materialism to argue for 
<br>
such a theory. Plenty of perfectly good materialists such as Bernard 
<br>
Williams reject it. I think they are separate issues. Even if scientific 
<br>
materialism is a necessary condition for a theory of identity such as 
<br>
Parfit's, I don't think it is a sufficient condition.
<br>
<p>Once again I'll ask people who have access to a good library with the 
<br>
journal _Foundation_ to have a look at the special Australian issue which I 
<br>
co-edited in mid-2000. This has the definitive article on people's 
<br>
intuitions about all this, by Aubrey Townsend, a philosopher at Monash 
<br>
University (entitled &quot;Survival in Cyberspace&quot;).
