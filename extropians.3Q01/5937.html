<p>
Action by the music industry against MP3 ftp sites and Websites gave us
<br>
Napster.  Action against Napster gave us Gnutella and Bearshare.
<br>
<p>So I've been wondering what kind of technology this implies.  In general,
<br>
current solutions are decentralizing against legal attacks on a central
<br>
weak point, but they are not up to fully &quot;revolutionary&quot; quality, meaning
<br>
that you wouldn't want to use these solutions to support a &quot;Moon Is a
<br>
Harsh Mistress&quot; revolution.  That level of security requires being able to
<br>
actually hide the fact that you're a node, and ensure that the discovery
<br>
and physical seizure of one node compromises a limited number of others
<br>
(ideally zero, but I can't figure out how to do that).
<br>
<p>I don't have time to write a post that's as long as I'd like, but my
<br>
thoughts have been wandering into the territory of chained blind IP
<br>
obscuration - in other words, only the second-to-last recipient of a
<br>
packet knows who the last recipient is, because the address of the next
<br>
recipient in the chain is encrypted, and can be decoded only by the key of
<br>
the node that needs to forward it.
<br>
<p>If the government attempts to make possession of a Bearshare application
<br>
into a felony, then there would be the additional problem of obscuring the
<br>
fact that you are acting as a node at all.  Disguising the traffic strikes
<br>
me as a technologically more complex problem that could severely limit the
<br>
bandwidth of any solutions.
<br>
<p>The bandwidth problem might result in a solution where it's possible to
<br>
have secure distributed P2P applications that involve moving small bits of
<br>
data or text without anyone noticing, but it's not possible to send entire
<br>
files without calling attention to yourself.  The probable result as far
<br>
as &quot;the successor to Bearshare&quot; goes would be a network that traded the
<br>
opaque addresses of people who claimed to have certain files; the actual
<br>
files would be sent through a corresponding chain of ICQ recipients, or
<br>
some other &quot;permitted&quot; application, once the address trade was
<br>
established.  On the other hand, running a disguised revolution, which
<br>
probably shouldn't be trading large files, would be an easier problem.  I
<br>
wonder whether anyone has previously tried to develop some helpful
<br>
revolution-support software on behalf of the folks trapped in China.
<br>
<p>It's a real pity that IPv6 isn't already an established standard; then
<br>
nobody but the final recipient would have any idea what the traffic was,
<br>
and it would simply be a matter of adding on a layer of abstraction so
<br>
that nobody but the final and second-to-final recipients knew where the
<br>
traffic was going.  We need more legal peer-to-peer applications that
<br>
routinely encrypt their traffic, so that a revolutionary-quality system
<br>
can pretend to be one.
<br>
<p>The prospect of *development* of this software becoming illegal leads me
<br>
to think that the software will be developed in some non-signatory nation,
<br>
but there's also the territory of opaque distributed development.
