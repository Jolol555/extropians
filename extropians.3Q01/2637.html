<em>&gt; &gt; The founding fathers also did not think enough ahead to institute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mechanisms that would act to limit the growth of government authority,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like mandating sunset clauses, term limits, as well as preventing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; congressmen from being appointed to the Supreme Court, and preventing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; families of civil servants from establishing bureaucratic dynasties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This lack of foresight was inherent in the fact that the founders were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; generally of agrarian extraction, with little experience in the courts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and bureaucracies of the european governments. They lacked the vision to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forsee that the US would ever rival the european powers in governmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inertia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nonsense. Who was it with the revolution every couple of hundred years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quote? The founding fathers of the US had enough sense to know that anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they did was futile in the long run. At least they kept the initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consitution pretty simple.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, Jefferson thought a revolution every generation would be good,
<br>
but he, and the rest of them, never built it into the Constitution. The
<br>
process of amending the Constitution doesn't constitute a just method to
<br>
replace revolution, because the system is controlled by the parties in
<br>
power. You can't get an amendment on the books that hasn't been proposed
<br>
by the leaders of both houses of congress.
<br>
<p>One of the things I like about the NH state constitution is that it is
<br>
written with a secession clause in it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you can come up with a set of bureaucratic rules that will prevent bloat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of bureaucracy on a timescale of centuries (i.e. will alter the very essence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of human societal nature), I'd like to see them. Ever played Nomic? It's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very enlightening game that aptly demonstrates politics on fast forward.
</em><br>
<p>a) every new law must sunset an old law (whose funding it appropriates)
<br>
or else imposes a new tax.
<br>
b) all new taxes must pass by a super majority (passed in Washington
<br>
State 5-6 years ago), except as part of a declaration of war act.
<br>
c) unless the nation is operating in a state of war or national
<br>
emergency, no presidential orders can be issued which are not explicitly
<br>
for the purpose of fulfilling a law or policy passed by Congress.
<br>
d) all presidential orders and congressional acts passed during a war or
<br>
emergency must be rescinded upon the conclusion of said war or
<br>
emergency, and must be reviewed every two years by their appropriate
<br>
congressional committees during the war or emergency.
<br>
e) growth in the number of federal employees must remain the same as a
<br>
percent of the general population, excluding during war or national
<br>
emergency, and all new employees during war or national emergency may
<br>
compete for the posts of pre-war/pre-emergency bureaucrats upon its
<br>
conclusion.
<br>
f) Having had parents or grandparents serve in bureaucratic posts
<br>
detracts from the score of candidates for bureaucratic employment, to an
<br>
increasing degree with increasing rank.
<br>
g) eliminate congressional salaries. Pay congresscritters gas/airfare
<br>
money and per diem 75% of their cost of living while congress is in
<br>
session. Make receipt of any other funds from the public purse or
<br>
private donations from groups or corporations by congresscritters equal
<br>
to high treason: a hanging offense.
<br>
h) All aspects of the life of any congresscritter or bureaucrat above
<br>
GS-8 is freely available to the public.
<br>
i) Bribery of bureaucrats is similarly high treason, for both briber and
<br>
bribee.
<br>
j) No law firm can maintain offices within a 100 mile radius of the US
<br>
capitol.
