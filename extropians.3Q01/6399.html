<em>&gt; This, however, is not the reason I'm not in shock.  I think I recall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty clearly my reaction when I switched on my computer, opened Netscape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; email, and saw in the helpful headlines that the World Trade Center had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ceased to exist; I saw it as a piece of future history that had just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turned real.  It was something that any number of novels or fictional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; timelines might have included to add color.  So that fictional construct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turned real and thereby moved us a step into the twenty-first century,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; albeit not in a nice way.  Essentially the inverted version of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction I had on reading about Dolly the sheep:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Whoa, we really are living in the future.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My second reaction was to be glad that I wasn't reading &quot;New York,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chicago, and Washington D.C. Destroyed By Nuclear Detonations.&quot;  We're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeing the lite version of the &quot;domestic massive terrorist disaster&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario here.  The only really unusual thing about the disaster is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it happened in America.  Most of the impact, crashing global stock markets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so on, consists of people reacting to the terrorism.  A nuclear weapon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroying New York, on the other hand, would be a significant disaster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of how people reacted to it.
</em><br>
<p>Almost exactly my initial reaction.  Upon waking Tuesday morning
<br>
I checked a stock quote page, which said markets were shut down
<br>
due to a terrorist attack in New York.  A few tense moments passed
<br>
while the article loaded, hoping it wasn't nuclear or biological.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; My reaction, on the whole, is that people are trying to forcibly make this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into one of the most significant events in world history.  I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is.  Not intrinsically.  I understand the impulse to magnify the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importance.  One doesn't want several thousand people to have died for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that doesn't ultimately change the course of history.  But I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think we'll see similar events in the future, and I don't think those will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change the course of history either.  It's just a lot of unnecessary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointless deaths.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the US does do anything real, militarily, it will probably involve more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death and destruction than was caused by the destruction of the World
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trade Center, dozens or hundreds of bombs instead of two planes, dropped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on some dirt-poor country far less capable of dealing with the disasters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resulting from each and every bomb impact, and the only real end result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be more hatred of the United States.  I don't expect that will stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the United States from doing it anyway.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; This is pretty much how I expected the future to go.  If we're lucky,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we'll make it to the Singularity inside the decade and we won't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons of mass destruction used on major cities during that interval. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if we aren't that lucky, I won't be surprised.
</em><br>
<p>I'll be astonished if we are that lucky.  Intelligent people should
<br>
feel this pin prick, recognize that a dagger thrust is all but
<br>
inevitable, and start making contingency plans.
