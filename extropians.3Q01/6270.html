<em>&gt; I expect you will never see the door open ever again.  One fast thing to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowed to go near the plane, and to keep them locked in until every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passenger is off the plane and barred from returning.  And, yes, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will beef up that bulkhead.
</em><br>
<p>The next group of terrorists that tries to take over a plane will be
<br>
ripped to shreds by the bare hands of their alleged hostages no matter
<br>
what weapons they have.  We may very well have seen the last plane
<br>
hijacking, or the last successful hijacking at any rate.  In fact, the
<br>
last successful hijacking would be the flight that crashed into the
<br>
Pentagon.  On the fourth flight, the passengers and their cellphones
<br>
learned that the rules had changed, knew they were going to die, and were
<br>
willing to die earlier to prevent the hijackers from destroying another
<br>
target.
<br>
<p>UNLESS all the terrorists need to do is smuggle one man and one knife into
<br>
the cockpit, then close the armored door and pilot the plane into the
<br>
Capitol building as the passengers scream and futilely claw at the
<br>
bulkhead.
<br>
<p>Maybe beefing up the airlock isn't such a great idea.
