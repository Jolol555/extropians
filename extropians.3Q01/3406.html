<p><p><em>&gt; Oh, yea, the idea:  in those vacant bvildings, we could hold a wicked

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn fine idea Spike. Urban Paintball is just about as much fun as 
<br>
you can have with your clothes on. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an avid paintballer I have mused over the problem of the mess that 
<br>
paintballs leave. Yes they are biodegradable and non-toxic but they do stain. 
<br>
I have first hand proof of this as I own the only Pink apple tree in my 
<br>
street. The trouble is that the paint contained in the paintballs is a water 
<br>
based emulsion using the same pigments that are used in &quot;Wood stains&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;household paint&quot;. The paint does wash off and degrade staight away if you 
<br>
wash it imediately with water, but if it dries, you have to scrub it or sand 
<br>
it down just like normal household emulsion.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im sure one of the chemists on the list could come up with a formular 
<br>
for paint that degrades or at least the pigment degrades when it oxidises.
<br>
