<p><em>&gt; The aristotelian philosophy is an ethics of purposes, that says us

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and find the best possible means to achieve it.
</em><br>
<p>This is of course why aristotelian and aristotelian-based views immediately clash
<br>
with the &quot;PC mindset&quot; as Greg described - they are unashamedly universalistic
<br>
(there is a goal that everybody wants), and suggest that the philosopher is an
<br>
active social force for this good. The cultural relativism today, while starting
<br>
with the correct realisation that other cultures were not necessarily wrong and
<br>
inferior to our own (and strengthened by what Brin calls the meme of otherness:
<br>
our own culture's desire for and acceptance of the new and different), eventually
<br>
developed into a position where no narrative is allowed to have superiority over
<br>
another (in that case the proper response is to deconstruct it, which is said to
<br>
put it back in its proper place somehow) and universalist claims got a very bad
<br>
name. In this mindset the purpose of the intellectual/philosopher is rather to
<br>
deconstruct than to construct or instruct. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
This points at a real strength for transhumanism: we are willing to do the later
<br>
two, and there is a tremendous desire for such things in our society. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what is the this highest good i the ethics we are discussing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aristotle answers &quot;eudaimonia&quot;. I think that the term is translated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into &quot;happiness&quot; in English, which isn't the same as pure lust or joy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A state of eudaimonia is also closely knit to ACTION, more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically the kind of action that enables man to accomplish his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature.  What nature?  The specifically human, that distinguishes us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the animals, is the faculty of reason. To achieve eudaimonia is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus to achieve a harmonical fullfilling of the faculty of reason.
</em><br>
<p>Here there are many worthwhile links to humanistic psychology dealing with
<br>
self-actualization, Csikszentmihaly's concept of flow, automorphism and practical
<br>
optimism, all which seem to embody aspects of eudaimonia. 
<br>
<p>A transhumanist concept of eudaimonia would hence have to incorporate a
<br>
transhumanist concept of what is the specifically (trans)human nature. This is
<br>
one of the things I believe we need to really work on: at present there are no
<br>
good visions of human nature that both fit the humanistic vision of humans and
<br>
the scientific advances of the the last 200 years. This lack is really noticeable
<br>
in the debate, and when I encounter attempts to reconcile them (e.g. how
<br>
neuroscience and free will could co-exist) the results are often pretty silly.
<br>
But given our ambitions and interest in being a third culture, I think we not
<br>
only need to do it but can do it too. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The link between happiness and action can be expressed as happiness in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an active life in accordance to virtue.  Virtue are the habits that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make men able to accomplish certain deeds, because become just by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acting justly, courageous by acting courageously.  Morality (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy) is to give a guide for real life.
</em><br>
<p>I think the ability to modify habits is one of the building blocks of a
<br>
transhumanist lifestyle. How do we think we can live for centuries if we can't
<br>
even control our eating properly? (and technology is not a real solution, because
<br>
then you need to create the habit of using the technology. Like most exercise
<br>
machines sold on the shopping channel, even life extension treatments often end
<br>
up stored safely away under the bed unless combined with the building of a habit
<br>
of use). Expressed in an Aristotelian way this would be the building of virtue:
<br>
transhumanism is based on becoming more virtuous. 
<br>
<p>Transhumanist virtues might not exactly correspond to the traditional ones, or we
<br>
might even introduce new ones. For example, the proper balance between long-range
<br>
investments and short-range exploitation is hard to strike when planning one's
<br>
future, but it still necessary. This would be a transhumanist virtue, the proper
<br>
balance between the far future and the direct. Many others are possible. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As you can see, there are som differences between a platonic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aristotelian view.  And thus it is important to see that an enmeshing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Plato into the transhumanist tradition will only damage it.
</em><br>
<p>In what ways do you think Plato is insinuating himself into transhumanism?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also think that the thomist tradition of alter years (for instance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Douglas Rasmussen' s and Douglas Den Uyl' s works) is important.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is why I think that liberalism is important, as a meta- ideology, as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frame in which transhumanism can act since it bring on a society where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are given the possibility and the freedom to use their faculty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of reason.  In that society transhumanism is protected, given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility to develop itself, while not enforcing itself on someone.
</em><br>
<p>Also, that meta-ideology gives a ready answer to those critics who fear that a
<br>
transhumanist world would impose change onto them. In a liberal society there is
<br>
room for both. Sure, this meta-ideological answer doesn't solve all the problems
<br>
and will unfortunately not convince many people that are steeped in the idea that
<br>
all ideologies always try to encompass all of society and all people in it (this
<br>
is another reason for the fear of universalism).  But then again, the Amish are
<br>
doing well these days despite that they share the same continent with Silicon
<br>
Valley. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Politics is all about fighting.  A mouse can roar, but it only sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like squeaking to a cat! A cat can roar, but it only sounds like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meowing to a lion. The ultimate goal is to become a lion.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>To be what you want to be: isn't this the essence of being human?
