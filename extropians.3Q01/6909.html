<br>
<p>You don't even need to conduct strikes. You need smart mines. Scenario
<br>
alternative: after conducting face recognition intelligence, you sow the
<br>
afghani countryside with 'rocks' which are camouflaged smart mines which
<br>
only detonate when a face that matches one in the established database
<br>
comes into range.
<br>
<p>You could have these mines act as a distributed network, sharing data
<br>
between them to track enemy movements, collect further intelligence,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>Also have these smart mines respond with a transponder signal to the
<br>
proper encrypted signal so that after the war is over, we can go around
<br>
and collect these devices so as to not permanently mar the countryside
<br>
of the target.
