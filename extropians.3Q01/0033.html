<em>&gt; Please see Mike Lorrey's post for examples.  The political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremism of which we speak, e.g. that in Russia, Italy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Germany, and recently in Yugoslavia really doesn't seem to

</em><br>
<p>However, I consider the issues at the basis of european extremism to be
<br>
rather simple, while their solutions are hilariously ludicrous. American
<br>
examples of extremism (slavery, civil rights, taxation without
<br>
representation, the desire to not live under the threat of nuclear
<br>
annihilation, the desire to not live in a police state) are all rather
<br>
profound issues of the human condition.
<br>
You'd have to LIKE living like a lemming in a fishbowl in a house full
<br>
of hungry cats to enjoy the sort of extremism that occurs in europe. I'm
<br>
sure that such is just fine for some people, but we are over here
<br>
specifically because we DONT like it.
