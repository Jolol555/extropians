<em>&gt; &gt;From a rational position, *if* the case can be made that the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of resources and delay the development of the technologies we anticipate

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I pressume you would next go for Iraq, then, since the costs of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bombing Saddam repeatedly are adding to the delay. Then, Serbia I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect, since all that peacekeeping is expensive as hell. Naturally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you will go then through some African countries that currently take

</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries like mine, so you can be spared the tons of risky loans our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic reconstruction will take.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please clarify if you have any plans to try and make your case into public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy, or if this is just a theoretical exercise in cost reductions. I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to buy my survival gear and supplies in time, you know.
</em><br>
<p>Look at it this way: Our primary goal, among others, is practical
<br>
immortality. Any activity which causes death is a crime against our
<br>
goals. Any action which delays the achievement of practical immortality
<br>
is a crime against our goals, because hundreds of thousands of people
<br>
will die of other causes during the period of delay.
<br>
<p>What is the population of Afghanistan? Ten million? How much time does
<br>
it take for that many people in the world to die of other causes? 6
<br>
months? A year? If the actions of those responsible for terrorism delay
<br>
the achievement of immortality by enough time that the number of people
<br>
who die instead of becoming immortal exceeds that of those who stand in
<br>
its way, then from a PURELY rational, cost/benefit point of view,
<br>
Robert's statement is entirely justified, but only if such action
<br>
actually does result in saving that time.
<br>
<p>I know that this is a rather disgusting thing to say. Life and death
<br>
decisions always are. I saw on tv last night an interview of a woman
<br>
seeking her brother-in-law in New York who was disgusted by going from
<br>
hospital to hospital, and getting lists not just of people, identified
<br>
and unidentified, but also lists of unidentified body parts and their
<br>
distinguishing characteristics. She says she will never look at a list
<br>
of names the same way again.
<br>
<p>In positions of leadership, people always have to make life and death
<br>
decisions. Building the Golden Gate Bridge, for example, could have been
<br>
accomplished by a couple methods. We could have spent less money and
<br>
endured more accidental deaths by construction workers, or spent more
<br>
and had less deaths. The leaders have to decide how much a life is worth
<br>
in that context.
<br>
<p>Similarly, take the arsenic in drinking water debate here in the US. The
<br>
national health organizations found that reducing the standard of
<br>
arsenic in drinking water from 50 ppm to 10 ppm would result in the
<br>
saving of 9 lives, at a cost of $75-150 million. The insurance industry
<br>
can tell you that the average human life today is worth about $6.5
<br>
million. By cost benefit analysis, it is unjustified to spend more than
<br>
that per life saved. Even if you spend $6.5 million per life saved, it
<br>
is a wash, you are just killing 9 DIFFERENT people than those who would
<br>
have died from arsenic poisoning. 9 people are gonna die one way or the
<br>
other. It is only when you spend less than the value of a life that you
<br>
are actually saving lives. In the case of arsenic, if you spend more
<br>
than $52 million to have more stringent standards, you are not doing any
<br>
net good in the world.
<br>
<p>In the case of terrorism delaying immortality: if you kill fewer people
<br>
than are saved by the resultant acceleration of the achievement of
<br>
immortality, you are rationally justified. All that is left is a moral
<br>
debate over whether sins of commission are more wrong than sins of
<br>
omission.
