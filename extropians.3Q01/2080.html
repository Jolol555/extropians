<p>Brian, guaranteed income isn't the same as welfare as we know it in the U.S.
<br>
I'm sorry I don't have time to write more about it at the moment. I'll try
<br>
to when I have a moment, maybe next week. For now, take a look at
<br>
<a href="http://www.odyssey.on.ca/~balancebeam/dadless/badwelfare.htm">http://www.odyssey.on.ca/~balancebeam/dadless/badwelfare.htm</a>
<br>
<p>As you'll guess from the excerpt below, it's a negative article. But rather
<br>
than conclude, without further thought, that a guaranteed income would never
<br>
work, it might be more useful to make an effort to see WHY there would be
<br>
problems with it in the present-day U.S. Given the high likelihood that many
<br>
people will find themselves without jobs in the near future, it might be
<br>
especially helpful to critically consider the idea that most people in our
<br>
culture find a purpose in life only from working for wages or a salary, and
<br>
that getting a paying job is the only purpose of education.
<br>
With respect to families, as a former volunteer for a women's shelter which
<br>
provided emergency help for battered women, I find it interesting to note
<br>
that families broke up as a result of the guaranteed income. Given the large
<br>
number of women and children I've seen trapped in unimaginably horrible
<br>
marriages for economic reasons, I'd venture to suggest that the breakup of
<br>
families can often be a very good thing.

<p>------------------------------------------
<br>
Excerpt from &quot;Fatherlesness and Poverty go Hand in Hand&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Mr. Chrétien's guaranteed annual income isn't merely a bad idea. It's a bad
<br>
idea that has been put to the test -- and flunked. Proponents of the
<br>
guaranteed income take pleasure in pointing out that it was devised by
<br>
Milton Friedman. What they neglect to add is that it was actually tried by
<br>
the Nixon administration in 1969. A large sample of poor working families in
<br>
Portland, Ore., were divided into two. Half were provided a guaranteed
<br>
income; half were left to use the state's existing social-welfare programs
<br>
if they needed and qualified for them. The author of the experiment, Daniel
<br>
Patrick Moynihan, then Nixon's favourite domestic policy adviser, admitted
<br>
later that he was shocked and horrified by the extent to which the
<br>
guaranteed-income families quit working and -- soon after -- broke apart.
<br>
<p>Nixon tried to solve the Portland problem by setting the guaranteed income
<br>
at a very low rate, so low that work would always be more attractive. But
<br>
this solution doomed the program politically: When it finally came to a vote
<br>
in Congress in 1971, conservatives voted &quot;nay&quot; because of the Portland
<br>
experience and liberals voted &quot;nay&quot; because the post-Portland Family
<br>
Assistance Plan (as this family-wrecking plan was euphemistically rebranded)
<br>
was too stingy.
<br>
<p>What Mr. Chrétien needs to grapple with is that the poverty problem in
<br>
Canada is the product of too much government, not too little. Does he really
<br>
imagine that if $5-billion a year in handouts has brought only misery to
<br>
Canada's native people, that an extra billion or two or five will make
<br>
things better? If our economy is failing to create enough well-paying jobs
<br>
because business is over-regulated and overtaxed, is it plausible that
<br>
regulating and taxing it more severely to pay for a grandiose new welfare
<br>
program will produce more good jobs?
