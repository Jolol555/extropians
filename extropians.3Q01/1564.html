</em><br>
<p>I think though, that it would behoove us to look at why exactly women
<br>
tend to have a greater preference for security over freedom. I don't
<br>
accept blindly the assertion that it is genetic. If it is not, then
<br>
protocols can be fashioned to help mitigate such phenomena.
<br>
<p>High freedom societies that are stable and relatively immune or
<br>
resistant to fascist takeover seems to be exclusively the realm of those
<br>
which are constructed on a basis of high trust between individuals
<br>
outside the family unit. The US government was constructed in such a
<br>
society (NOTE: High trust between individuals has nothing to do with
<br>
trust in government. The founding fathers trusted each other with the
<br>
reins of government, but not the instruments of government per se) of
<br>
white males who knew each other, and trusted those they didn't know
<br>
because they were also educated white males (i.e. recognised members of
<br>
the leadership class). Many of these white males were of the same
<br>
religious denomination, were Masons, and had attended the same colleges
<br>
and been members of the same state legislatures.
<br>
<p>In this society, women and blacks were not trusted with the
<br>
responsibilities of citizenship, they were seen as less than capable of
<br>
bearing the 'white man's burden', and female blacks were considered
<br>
least capable of all. 
<br>
<p>When later on first blacks, then women, were enfranchised as full
<br>
citizens, there were significant movements who continued to oppose this,
<br>
either officially, unofficially, or systemically, which demonstrated to
<br>
the newly enfranchised groups that they were still not fully trusted for
<br>
reasons they had absolutely no control over, they had no hope of ever
<br>
earning through merit the trust of a full citizen with a large amount of
<br>
the white male populace, and that through that lack of trust, they
<br>
learned that the words that white men spoke in the open were not to be
<br>
trusted, because they could not be depended upon to follow through on
<br>
their lofty pronouncements of equal rights.
<br>
<p>At the same time, the country was in desperate need of labor to build
<br>
the expansionist dreams of its leaders, westward into the frontier, and
<br>
forward with technology and infrastructure, such that immigration from
<br>
non-anglo countries vastly increased, and the lack of trust inherent in
<br>
these non-anglo cultures resisted the forces of assimilation, thus
<br>
diluting further the sum of trust between all individuals.
<br>
<p>As a result, it is not surprising that women, being the last
<br>
enfranchised group, is the least trusting toward others, even between
<br>
themselves, to the point that studies show that all groups: black males,
<br>
black females, and white females all demonstrate greater trust for white
<br>
males than for members of their own group, and that these groups all
<br>
tend toward reliance on legal measures that prefer security to freedom.
