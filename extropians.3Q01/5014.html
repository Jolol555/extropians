<em>&gt; This is uselessly confusing IMO.  Why not just avoid using the &quot;M&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word, e.g., never say &quot;That's immoral!!&quot;, &quot;we much teach morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the school&quot;, etc.?  A quite unnecessary (to me, at least until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you enlighten me) semantic quagmire opens up under us whenever we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to discuss the &quot;M&quot; word in the abstract, instead of much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usefully attacking the things we dislike or think are harmful to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, e.g., adultery, disloyalty, brutality, political correctness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divisiveness, racism, diversity, separatism, zenophobia, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess I have to go along with those who say that m******* is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relative, because that's closer to abandoning the term, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't allude to something in the universe that no one has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever seen.

<p>I agree with the not teaching morality in school point you made, its
<br>
unworkable with the public school system, but it would work with a private
<br>
one though. On the other hand, failure to identity evil only benefits evil.
<br>
There are those of us that believe in an &quot;objective&quot; morality based on
<br>
reason. Participants in this philosophy are more then welcome to identify an
<br>
evil and explain why it is so. Trying to obscure an immoral act is in effect
<br>
immoral. The semantic quagmire you speak of is a problem and I'm not sure
<br>
how to get around it as long as people of different base philosophies are
<br>
talking. You cant agree on the definition of racism (sound familiar) if you
<br>
cant even agree if existence is objective or relative (or on your axioms).
<br>
Remember the old saying &quot;Evil triumphs when good men do nothing&quot;. Also, you
<br>
can get into the semantic quagmire arguing your terms as well, like what is
<br>
adultery. Remember the recent presidential fiasco where oral sex wasnt
<br>
included in that definition or the LONG thread where we attemped
<br>
unsuccessfully to define racism. Eventually, this attempt to dealt with
<br>
concepts by working further away from the abstract and more on the concrete
<br>
will fail as we try to determine the definition of what &quot;IS&quot; is. Very sad
<br>
indeed.
