<em>&gt;Surly one primary Extropian value is the concept of ones intellect being in

<em>&gt;Please express your thoughts and ideas, but don't just rant.

Anger is a rational emotional response to atrocity, but once rage passes, it should be replaced by steely, cold and calculating implacable relentless anger.  The 'people' we are dealing with have demonstrated amazing focus, intensity, perseverence and singlemindeddness in the pursuit of their sick and twisted goals; they trained as moles, in and outside of my country, for years - just so they could successfully kill themselves while taking as many of us as possible with them, in a bid for heaven.  Such people must be rooted out and destroyed, as well as those who so program them, and, make no mistake about it, it will be done, with or without the help or approval of anyone on this list.  And especially without the nonexistent help of navel-gazing analysis paralysis types or self-hating sycophantic citizen versions of Uncle Tom shuffling to the terrorist tune.
