<em>&gt; A dark day for the planet, one which i feel will drag on for a long time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Make no mistake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the situation which i see developing from these events is going to be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nasty on both sides.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Already US officials are talking of full blooded retaliation and &quot;Acts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war&quot; ( something i
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought was only possible between Nation States  ) reports are coming in of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explosions in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghanistan.( which like many other reports around this incident remain to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be verified and attributed )
</em><br>
<p>They are attributed.  It is 2 or more factions fighting each
<br>
other. Perhaps the ones who approve[d?] of this fighting the
<br>
ones who don't? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Retaliation of course will make much of the population of the US feel good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But will guarantee yet another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cycle of internecine conflict. Unfortunately i cannot envisage the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration, considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mood of the US population, taking any other course of action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I hate to say it but I don't see how any other course of action
<br>
would accomplish anything except to say &quot;kick us, we won't kick
<br>
back&quot;.  The response should be surgical to take out the problem
<br>
without a lot of extra unneeded vengeance and saber-rattling. 
<br>
But it should be made very clear that no group can do things
<br>
without swift and costly consequences.  We cannot not act
<br>
because we fear more attacks.  We must act if we fear more
<br>
attacks and act to lessen their likelihood by taking out key
<br>
players who could launch such an attack. 
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; But where did all this come from, lets be frank. Acts like this do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spring up in isolation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many years of nee-jerk support of Israel's warts and all policies in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; region, combined with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointless willingness to be confrontational with Middle Eastern nations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Has resulted in the USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The Mid-East situation is much too complex for simplistic
<br>
analysis. And many of those Middle Eastern nations were quite
<br>
confrontational with us, with one another and with our allie
<br>
Israel from the get-go.  Some of their governments are run by
<br>
religious fanatics who consider jihad a sacred duty.  Some of
<br>
them seek to wipe Israel off the map and consider us the Great
<br>
Satan.  
<br>
<p>Not that we haven't done some slimey or at least very
<br>
questionable things in the region over the years.  But nothing
<br>
that justifies this kind of attack and nothing that should stop
<br>
us from finding and stopping the attackers.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; These of course are not the only contributory factors, they are however the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones that IMHO most US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens will choose to ignore. Which is almost certain recipe for another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full cycle of violent retribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on both sadly misguided sides.being regarded as International enemy #2 in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the eyes of much of the Muslim world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What full cycle?  The terrorist groups (very finite number)
<br>
capable of such attacks will either be stepped on or severely
<br>
curtailed one way or another.  From that point on where are such
<br>
full attacks likely to come from?  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Add to this mix Muslim nations with a suspicious attitude to US motives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Religions and cultures that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find much of the others distasteful or repugnant. Many pockets of Muslim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poverty, ignorance and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strict adherence to a perceived fundamentalists credo. And a sense amongst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many Muslims that the West
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the US in particular would never support one of their causes no matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how just.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Blasting the shit out of US territory is not the way to get
<br>
support for any cause.  That message must be loud and clear.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Please don't for one second imagine that i am in any way justifying actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as the ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; committed today. My own dear sister was probably saved, only by the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that rather than working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in one of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's WTC offices, she now works in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Braodway offices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However i do feel that ignoring the elements that have help to shape the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspectives of the ( suspected )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perpetrators, is not the best way to sech a long lasting solution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The terrorists will be taken out first.  Then we can work on
<br>
settling long range tension with the more reasonable parties.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Humans are rather nasty violent primates, with huge propensity for ignoring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the suffering of &quot;others&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this i know from experience, but we have to change at some point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  But giving the message that you will not defend
<br>
yourself or strike back regardless of what comes is not a very
<br>
good idea at an international level.  Human groups just don't
<br>
work that way.
