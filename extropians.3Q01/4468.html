<p><em>&gt; Well, the specific point is that Whitesides said that the flagellum is

</em><br>
<p>Yes, but though a raven is perhaps not very much like a writing desk I
<br>
have a very nice collection of antique chess pieces.
<br>
<p>I've read it, and it is an astonishingly vacuous piece. It reminded me
<br>
vividly as to why I stopped reading SciAm many years ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whitesides' larger point is quoted mostly above, that the similarity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between the flagellar and electric motors is &quot;largely illusory&quot; because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electric motors are magnetic.  Everything about their design is oriented
</em><br>
<p>Electric motors are either electric or electrostatic. Electrostatic motors
<br>
are described in experimental books for teenagers published decades ago.
<br>
Saying that electric motors are impossible at nanoscale is about the same
<br>
as saying that houses cannot be built because people cannot walk through
<br>
walls. That's true, as long as one keeps ignoring doors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; towards organizing the magnetic fields to induce rotary motion.  However
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magnetic fields don't work that well at the nanoscale and do not drive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the flagellar motor.  Hence his claim that they are not really all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar in their operating principles.
</em><br>
<p>Of course it would be stupid to use flagellar rotor to drive a nanosub,
<br>
unless one is limited in one's engineering to hybrid designs, or strives
<br>
for maximum biocompatibility (this would be a major point in using
<br>
biological components for coating hull and propulsion).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Freitas points out that bacteria smaller than about 0.6 microns don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swim, below that size &quot;locomotion has no apparent benefit&quot; (9.4.2.4 of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nanomedicine).  So Whitesides' error was in misunderstanding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intended size of nanobots; his reasoning would be correct for the 0.1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; micron size he was describing.
</em><br>
<p>I guess if one exerts a lot of effort one can salvage parts of the
<br>
article. It would have been truly difficult to write a piece utterly
<br>
devoid of content, the author is good, but he's not that good, and SciAm's
<br>
editors still haven't completely flatlined on the EEG.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think that the rigid rods would have to be all that bulky.
</em><br>
<p>Bulk becomes relative when you're looking at the reaction site. Try
<br>
manipulating a 1 mm objects with your human fingers meaningfully. Then try
<br>
manipulating two or three such objects meaningfully, using several people,
<br>
on the surface of a flat table, beyond where your fingers cannot go.
<br>
<p>Moreover, we're not just talking structural components, you need
<br>
sensorics, you need cooling and fresh/spent moiety ducts (unless you
<br>
retract and cycle them offsite), you need power cables, while you have to
<br>
keep the mass down so you natural oscillation frequency doesn't become too
<br>
low, as you want to attain maximum processivity at given amount of juice.
<br>
<p>I really recommend you download VMD, load some of the notoriousdiamondoid
<br>
parts (neon pump, bearing, manipulator), switch on space fill, and drag
<br>
them around, particulary loading several copies of the manipulator and
<br>
arranging them in front of a diamond wall (where the pump is embedded in)
<br>
will be illuminating.
<br>
<p>Of of course the manipulator is just a toy, as it is lacking critical
<br>
functionality. The tool tip is empty, and it doesn't have sensors, and the
<br>
concentric coranulenes on the bucky rod don't have rods attached which
<br>
lead to bucky linear actuators.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Merkle is just showing the end structures and they are quite thin.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly, and this is why these structures are misleading.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You don't have to get too fat to have strong rods, and in fact the tools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used by Merkle don't seem to require huge forces anyway.
</em><br>
<p>The point is not huge forces, the point is to maintain sufficient rigidigy
<br>
that thermal noise and rapid cyclic oscillations will not interfere, which
<br>
still not suffering from crowding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for speed, that's not really an issue at this level of design.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Merkle's main point was to show that you could come up with tools that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would do the job.
</em><br>
<p>The longer I think about it, the more I dislike the downsized robot arms
<br>
paradigm. The armies of tethered (juice, inks) robotic walker on a flat
<br>
surface nanolithoprinting small structures and manipulating (splicing,
<br>
welding, modifyng) random bucky parts seem to be pointing in the right
<br>
direction. The metaphor of picking up and putting down atoms is really
<br>
lousy, even if it's just formally so (transfer of a single group from an
<br>
activated moiety). You don't have to do that to self-rep, though it would
<br>
be of course nice if you could switch to slow-processivity but
<br>
enhanced-control mode for some critical components.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The point of Merkle's analysis was to show how you could have a tool
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set that could build carbon structures, and, most importantly, also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build more copies of the tools.  This is the crucial element necessary
</em><br>
<p>I don't see that anywhere in Merkles paper. He describes the reaction
<br>
site, he describes the structure around it, but always as isolated
<br>
occurences. He never tries to walk through a whole deposition circle in
<br>
machina, with all the strings attached. The paper is important, but he
<br>
most assuredly does not show how you could build more copies of the tools
<br>
with the tools he described.
<br>
<p>So, it's too early to uncork the Dom Perignon magnums yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; for self replication and to my knowledge no other paper has showed a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific design that could accomplish this.
</em><br>
<p>Correct: no paper has showed a specific design that could accomplish this.
<br>
I hope I'm going to see such a set of papers in the coming decades. The
<br>
next thing to do will be a doable bootstrap scenario (which will bee very
<br>
hirsute), and then we go into teotwawki mode.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Computronium&quot; is not likely to be an early product of nanotech IMO.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, computronium is basically round the corner, at least early 2d
<br>
computronium.  It could be as little as 5-10 years away.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to be a very advanced material.  To build mass quantities
</em><br>
<p>Oh no, it's not a complex material at all, in fact the more advanced
<br>
versions of it will become simpler, as we learn to cut corners on
<br>
irrelevant aspects of the design.
<br>
<p>It's molecular crystal, a hardware implementation of a specific cellular
<br>
automaton, with a probably very simple rule (few 10 gate complexity in
<br>
modern lingo). Simple orthogonal structure both at crystal and cell level,
<br>
no movable parts. It is most efficiently assembled by self assembly via
<br>
complementary patches, which suggests doing it in biology first. The
<br>
elementary cell of the crystal would be about virus sized, of course you
<br>
can shrink it dramatically if you use buckytronics, which can also stand
<br>
more heat, or work at cryogenic temperatures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; of computronium you must have already solved all of the construction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems, so it will not work as a design strategy to rely on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of massive computation to solve the low level problems.  (OTOH it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be possible to build sufficiently massive computers using bulk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology.)
</em><br>
<p>As long as performance curve hasn't saturated too badly, you can stick to
<br>
Beowulfery, then you have to invest into a hardware force field engine
<br>
done in dedicated hardware. COTS has better payoff, that's why we don't do
<br>
this yet. But after a while we will.
