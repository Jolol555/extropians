<p>Oh hell, I will reply.
<br>
<p>The better schools go to Uni because the students do better in the year 12 exams, there
<br>
is no restriction, it is based on merit, but of course the &quot;good&quot; schools give their
<br>
students a better education, so they are over-represented at unis.
<br>
<p>As for paying off your education, it is apercentage of your salary, you pay it if you
<br>
earn more thana  certain threshold, and you pay back the debt, not a flat rate on your
<br>
salary for life.
<br>
<p>sheesh. You must be aware that Australians are LEGENDARY for taking the piss, and that
<br>
we find americans way way WAY too easy prey as they take everything literally. 
<br>
<p>Mind you, I have been sadly out of university for a couple of years, so my info may be
<br>
out of date.
<br>
<p>But I do think someone was pulling your leg.
<br>
<p>I was going to write exactly this a moment ago but I am ssh'ed into a BSD system and
<br>
formatting those huge lines in vi was too much for me to be bothered with.
