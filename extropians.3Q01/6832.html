<p>Well, then, you can go to the Middle East and gun down the Afghani whose
<br>
lives you don't value, and be killed in turn by terrorists who don't value
<br>
your life, while those of us who foolishly and impractically choose to
<br>
value all sentient life equally quietly buckle down and cooperate on the
<br>
Singularity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And another thing, who do you think is more likely to advance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the singularity, the average resident of Wall Street or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average resident of Afghanistan who can not read or write in any

<p>(Sound effect:  Dull thump as head drops onto table.)
<br>
<p>I refer you to &quot;A specific refutation of genocide&quot;.
<br>
<p>I'm not a judge of whose life is worth living.  I just build
<br>
superintelligent altruists.  I may offer up my guesses as to what
<br>
lifestyles advance or retard the Singularity, but that's so that people
<br>
can better choose their lifestyles.  I am not in the business of
<br>
assassinating people whose net value to the Singularity falls below zero. 
<br>
You can't steer a car by selectively shooting out the tires.  And if you
<br>
kill someone and say, &quot;I can do it because I'm more valuable to the
<br>
Singularity than he was,&quot; I won't lift one damn finger to stop you from
<br>
going to prison, and I'll curse you along the way for defacing the meme.
<br>
<p>The people who will advance the Singularity are either altruists, or
<br>
selfish individuals who understand the game-theoretical importance of at
<br>
least *acting* as if all lives have equal value.  And people who act as if
<br>
the Singularity is an excuse to defect in the Prisoner's Dilemna are not
<br>
only going to get zapped by Tit for Tat, they are going to make a very bad
<br>
impression for transhumanist memes among exactly the population that would
<br>
otherwise be most likely to donate to the Singularity Institute.
