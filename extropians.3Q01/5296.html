Hi Harvey!  I thnk this is the first time I have responded to something you
<br>
wrote on the web instead of in person, but I think the rest of the readers
<br>
might be interested.
<br>
<p>From: &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20future%20president?&In-Reply-To=&lt;002001c13097$ec5e9120$67d64cd8@newstrom&gt;">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; I also think you have an inflated idea of what a hate crime is.  Hate
</em><br>
crimes
<br>
<em>&gt; give tougher sentences on criminals who commit violent crimes.  They do
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; arrest people for mere words or ideas.
</em><br>
<p>I would disagree with this.  The hate crime law does not give tougher
<br>
sentences based on the violence of the crime.  They give tougher sentences
<br>
based on what the perp was thinking.
<br>
<p><p><p>For example, a teen-age white male kills a black female who happens to be
<br>
lesbian.  The case is air-tight so he is convicted.  He gets 20 years for
<br>
murder.  (I'm making this number up.)  Then they try to figure out his
<br>
motive.  If he killed the woman because she was black, or because she was a
<br>
woman, or because she was a lesbian, then they tack on an extra 10 years
<br>
(again, number made up) because it was a &quot;hate crime&quot;.  If he merely made a
<br>
stupid bet that he would kill the next person who came along, and it had
<br>
nothing to do with prejudice, then they don't tack on the extra sentence,
<br>
because the crime was not a &quot;hate crime&quot;.
<br>
<p>The point being this:  He gets 20 years for murder.  Why should he get
<br>
another 10 because of what he was thinking?  The woman is just as dead
<br>
regardless of his thought process.  Also, many people worry that this is
<br>
criminalizing certain thoughts.  They say (and I agree) murder is illegal.
<br>
We don't need to (or want to) delve into what the guy was thinking.
<br>
<p><p><p>As a counter-point, I can tell you why these kinds of laws arose.  They
<br>
arose from events like the KKK burning a cross in front of black people's
<br>
houses in order to scare them.  Before the &quot;hate crimes law&quot; the worse they
<br>
got were $10 fine for tresspassing.
<br>
<p>This is another example of &quot;everybody knows what they meant&quot; (i.e. death
<br>
threat if the black family doesn't move out) but no one can prove it.  (All
<br>
that actually happened was a random item being burned on their lawn.)
<br>
<p>For people who agree (like I do) that the hate crime laws (as written now)
<br>
should be repealed, the solution to the burning cross is to acknowledge that
<br>
it is a threat and charge the cross-burners with intimidation, assault, etc.
<br>
There is no need to start delving into their thought processes.
