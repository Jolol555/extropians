<em>&gt; I am trying to understand what you mean, but it's difficult to see any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of rationality here. Do you consider climbing to be some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spiritual experience, or is the thrill physically addicting or what? 
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't say either of these.  I enjoy the exercise, being outdoors, the 
<br>
challenges (physical and mental), and being with friends among other 
<br>
things.  I brought it up in this context, not because I think of it as 
<br>
spiritual, but because I don't see it as rationally defendable.  Like 
<br>
choosing vanilla over chocolate.  I also see some parallels in the 
<br>
arational enjoyment of it with what some of the people defending 
<br>
spirituality are saying.  I hope you don't restrict yourself to things you 
<br>
can defend rationality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see a good reason to put yourself into that kind of lethal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation when we are this close to the Singularity. 
</em><br>
<p>It's less likely to be lethal than you think, given good practices, and I'm 
<br>
not willing to put enjoyment on hold for twenty or thirty years waiting for 
<br>
a singularity.  I consider myself more at risk when I drive from Silicon 
<br>
Valley to LA on highway 5.  The consequences are potentially lethal in the 
<br>
same vein as demonstrated by the local hiker who dragged himself out of the 
<br>
Sierras this week after being given up for dead by more than a hundred 
<br>
searchers.  Climbing with a group whose safety practices I respect is much 
<br>
safer than hiking alone.  There are risks, which is why I mentioned 
<br>
&quot;potentially lethal consequences&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I had no hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the future, and was convinced I was eventually going to be worm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; food no matter what then yeah I could see doing stuff like this. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway... 
</em><br>
<p>I'm signed up for Alcor because I like living and want it to go on.  
<br>
(<a href="http://discuss.foresight.org/~hibbert/WhyCryonics.html">http://discuss.foresight.org/~hibbert/WhyCryonics.html</a>)  I'm not willing 
<br>
to stop living because of the possibility of a really long life.  The 
<br>
evidence isn't in yet that we're going to make it past 150 years.  Progress 
<br>
in medicine and nanotech are slow and steady at this point, there's no 
<br>
revolutionary yet.
