<p><em>&gt; Sin and spirituality are words which derive their

</em><br>
<p>Two claims are implicit here; one is that whatever
<br>
these terms refer to, they ought to be replaced by
<br>
terms that do not derive from traditional religious
<br>
beliefs.  I find this very persuasive for a variety
<br>
of reasons, chief among them that it would prevent
<br>
simple miscommunication.  (I am opposed to the camp
<br>
that says that we can &quot;heal&quot; rifts between science
<br>
and religion---or any other substantive struggles---
<br>
by being mealy-mouthed in an effort to deceive or
<br>
to mollify.)
<br>
<p>The second claim is that traditional religious beliefs
<br>
are false, and therefore need to be debunked.  Few on
<br>
this list with argue with that.

<p><em>&gt; You are entitled to your opinions of course but do not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confused that they are any more than that.  &quot;Sin&quot; is a concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of some (not all) religions and actually has a more general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning of having broken one or more moral maxims (of whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source).
</em><br>
<p>But we are not short of other words that more clearly describe
<br>
the breaking of moral maxims, certainly not in English anyway.
<br>
So one cannot help but suspect that people who wish to use the
<br>
word &quot;sin&quot; in a serious way have something more on their plate.
<br>
I don't really know what it could be, unless, as I said before
<br>
to pander to people with traditional religious beliefs.  Please
<br>
tell me what it is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Spirituality has many levels of meaning and mostly seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more fundamental than religions.  Of course you are welcome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to substitute religiosity if you wish and to make it mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever you need it to mean to thoroughly disapprove of it.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what this means, except possibly to allege that 
<br>
J.R. wants to thoroughly disapprove of something.  Yes, it
<br>
is for sure true that spirituality has many levels of meaning.
<br>
That's one of the reasons that the term is inherently confusing.
<br>
Now among people whose beliefs are very similar, and so where
<br>
little or no confusion is liable to occur, use of the term is
<br>
quite warranted, of course.  But here, where we would like to
<br>
determine (I hope) just what substance lies behind use of the
<br>
term, I for one want to understand what drives atheists and
<br>
materialists to ever use it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it a retreat if one finds oneself to be honestly spiritual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or religious without for a moment letting go of science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and its achievements?  
</em><br>
<p>That sounds quite admirable, but contains a claim that is very
<br>
close to an accusation.  It firstly claims that there is some
<br>
substance to being &quot;honestly spiritual&quot; or &quot;honestly religious&quot;
<br>
even though accepting everything that we learn through science.
<br>
This still needs to be explicated.  The hidden pronouncement is
<br>
that atheists/materialists who denigrate religious beliefs (and
<br>
hence, easily, &quot;religiosity&quot;) are perhaps somewhat crippled 
<br>
morally, or at least lead impoverished lives of some description.
<br>
Now we total-atheists/materialists---who claim that &quot;spirituality&quot;
<br>
and &quot;religiousity&quot; do not describe us well---should be treated
<br>
as adults who are quite capable of owning up to actual shortcomings;
<br>
but it is incumbent upon those who think that we are lacking
<br>
something to be very explicit.  If you're right, we can handle it.
<br>
<p><p>Now I've argued with a very close friend for literally decades
<br>
about this issue of religiousity.  He claims, as several here
<br>
have, to be spiritual.  He is not as ready as J. R. Malloy or
<br>
myself (or Robert Ingersoll) to speak up about the falseness
<br>
of traditional religous beliefs.  A number of famous people
<br>
have claimed to be &quot;religious&quot;, where I just cannot see the
<br>
applicability of the term---so this is a familiar conundrum.
<br>
<p>Okay, so this discussion has gone on ever since Darwin, at least,
<br>
I suspect.  Perhaps there is not only a gene for religiousity,
<br>
but a separate gene that causes one to find the terms &quot;religious&quot;
<br>
and &quot;spiritual&quot; appealing, and causes one to wish very strongly
<br>
to apply them to oneself regardless of one's actual beliefs?
<br>
I'm being only half-serious, of course, but it indicates my
<br>
desperation here to find out what is going on.  My friend came
<br>
to admit that he and I did not differ substantially in either
<br>
our experiences or our beliefs.  So after all that time, I still
<br>
came away perplexed as to why atheists/materialists sometimes
<br>
employ those terms to describe themselves.  Perhaps one of the
<br>
people who so do use the terms could think long and carefully
<br>
and help us understand why.
