<p>Perhaps the results are not as different as they seem. The entrepreneurs 
<br>
were already working in something they felt passionate about. It seems 
<br>
natural that they would use the money to further their passion.
<br>
<p>The non-entrepreneurs would have worked for other people. That is not 
<br>
generally something that people feel passionate about. These days people 
<br>
are told over and over again that what they really want is to have 
<br>
recreation. Recreation is a giant industry. (I believe tourism is 
<br>
Australia's biggest money earner.) A lot of the non-entrepreneurs would 
<br>
believe that recreation was what they felt really passionate about.
<br>
<p>My father worked for the bank for many of his best years. When he retired 
<br>
with a heart condition he wanted to enjoy himself for a while. He soon 
<br>
found that he couldn't bear the &quot;idle&quot; life, so he bought a business and 
<br>
went back to work, but this time for himself and found that vastly more 
<br>
fulfilling.
<br>
<p>My point is that if the study followed the people longer than 3 years I bet 
<br>
they would have found that many more went back into the workforce.
<br>
<p>Another caution is that some people may end up doing work which often 
<br>
doesn't  earn a wage, for example charity work, or 3rd world development 
<br>
work, or musical composing, or artwork, or writing.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
