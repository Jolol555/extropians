Caveat:  I cannot express a generic &quot;woman's&quot;
<br>
viewpoint.  I can only give my opinions and
<br>
experiences as a TS woman.  Those may or may not be
<br>
similar to what people who were born female feel and
<br>
think.

</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure you can do that any better than you
<br>
currently do without living the role.  Estrogen may
<br>
help, it may not.  The mental and emotional effects
<br>
are subtle and not everybody reports them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And reversibly?  
</em><br>
<p>The two things which may not be reversible are
<br>
infertility and gynecomastia (male breast growth).
<br>
<p>You should have 3-6 months before there are any
<br>
irreversible effects.
<br>
<p>Any other changes... especial emotional and sex drive
<br>
will go away in a month or two.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would I lose my sex drive temporarily?
</em><br>
<p>It will most likely diminish... it may not.  I doubt
<br>
you'd loose it completely.  I've been on hormones for
<br>
4 years and I haven't lost mine.
<br>
<p>Actually... spontaneous erections rarely happen and
<br>
your mind spends much less time thinking about sex (I
<br>
believe that is the single biggest difference between
<br>
men and women) but you would still have the ability to
<br>
achieve erection and orgasm when you wanted to.
<br>
<p>It takes between 2 weeks and a month before any
<br>
changes are noticeable...
<br>
<p>Birth control pills wouldn't work either.  They don't
<br>
contain enough estrogen to have any effect.
<br>
<p>There is some small danger of Deep Vein Thrombosis if
<br>
you are over 40 and/or a smoker and take oral
<br>
estrogen... this is due to increased clotting factors
<br>
produced by the liver as the estrogen passes through.
<br>
<p>You can avoid that danger completely by using a non
<br>
oral estrogen.  My recommendation would be the
<br>
Estraderm patch.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My notion is that I would be a better companion for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my chosen female wife, if I could only understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what she is seeing.
</em><br>
<p>This experiment might help with that, it might not.
<br>
Part of a woman's world view comes from being a target
<br>
of male sex drive.  Without living in role for a
<br>
while, you won't experience that.  Before transition,
<br>
I gave very little thought to personal safety unless I
<br>
was in a known &quot;bad area&quot;.  I've had a few experiences
<br>
since transition that scared men.  Men following me...
<br>
approaching me in a parking garage... making sexually
<br>
explicit remarks/requests/demands.  And all in areas
<br>
that I knew were &quot;safe&quot; before transition.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Observation:  for some reason which I have never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understood, women seem to grok men's feelings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better than men grok women's feelings.  Loree,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone who has been both may have a unique insight 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this.
</em><br>
<p>The flip answer?  Men's feelings are based on sex.  
<br>
<p>Seriously, there is some basis for that flip comment,
<br>
though it isn't by any means the whole story.  
<br>
<p>Women tend to be smaller than men and are often
<br>
targets for mens sexual aggression... so figuring out
<br>
what men are thinking is a survival skill.
<br>
