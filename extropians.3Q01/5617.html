<em>&gt; &gt; If there is a problem, it's concentrated more in government (the PC ruling

</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is nothing but political BULLSHIT.  If J.R. had bothered to investigate
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>While Robert is exactly right about the President's official income from
<br>
the government, I think that he is forgetting about the many ways in
<br>
which politicians are able to abuse the campaign fundraising system (and
<br>
the legal defense fund system) as well as other mechanisms for trading
<br>
on celebrity and lobbying after leaving office, such that the
<br>
President's official income is to be considered a mere stipend compared
<br>
to their real income. In the 9 months since the election, the Cliontons
<br>
have cleared over $20 million together, nearly half of which they earned
<br>
prior to leaving office, and the rest while Hillary is an active US
<br>
Senator. Their combined legal bills never amounted to more than a few
<br>
million. Clinton got to keep all of his extra campaign funds, and
<br>
Hillary got to keep her excess campaign funds as well.
<br>
<p>I think a cogent question to ask is: Why would someone spend tens of
<br>
millions of dollars to get elected president, a position that only pays
<br>
a measely $400k/year, if they were not planning on stealing/soliciting
<br>
bribes to get it all back before they leave office?
