<p><em>&gt; I actually think the steady-state theory makes a LOT more sense than the

</em><br>
<p>I'd agree that the Big Bang is bunk.
<br>
<p>The Big Bang rests on the hypothesis that the universe is expanding, and in the end the plausibility
<br>
of its claims will depend on whether the universe is expanding.
<br>
<p>If it’s expanding, it was smaller in the past.  If you reverse the expansion far enough, it
<br>
originates at one point.  The Big Bang.  The BB is an immediate consequence of the idea that the
<br>
universe is expanding.
<br>
<p>The idea that the universe is expanding is built on an interpretation of the observations of the
<br>
American astronomer Edwin Hubble, which, when codified, became known as “Hubble’s Law.”
<br>
<p>In the 1920's Hubble was conducting the first systematic investigation into our neighboring galaxies.
<br>
Using a spectrometer to analyze the light emitted from galaxies, he observed a shift to the red end
<br>
of the spectrum in the light coming from distant galaxies.  Why should galactic light be shifted to
<br>
the red and not the blue portions of the spectrum? Why, for that matter, should it be shifted at all?
<br>
<p>An invigorating stab in the dark now followed. The pitch of a siren is altered as a police car
<br>
disappears down the street, the sound waves carrying the noise stretched by the speed of the car
<br>
itself. This is the familiar Doppler effect. Something similar, Hubble entertained, might explain the
<br>
redshift of the galaxies, with the distortions in their spectral signature arising as a reflection of
<br>
their recessional velocity as they disappeared into the depths.
<br>
<p>The redshift of a galaxy, cosmologists affirm, and so its recessional velocity, is proportional to
<br>
its distance and inversely proportional to its apparent brightness or flux. The relationship is known
<br>
as Hubble's law, even though Hubble himself even initially regarded the facts at his disposal with
<br>
skepticism.  [Hubble's original paper carried the footnote: &quot;It is not at all certain that the large
<br>
red shifts in the spectra are to be interpreted as a Doppler effect, but for convenience they are
<br>
expressed in terms of velocity and referred to as apparent velocities.&quot;]
<br>
<p>Hubble realized that it was possible, in theory, to further test the idea that the redshift
<br>
represented recessional velocity. He already had some preliminary data from the 100-inch telescope:
<br>
<p>&quot; … redshifts are evidence either of an expanding universe or of some hitherto unknown principle of
<br>
nature … Attempt have been made to attain the necessary precision with the 100-inch, and the results
<br>
appear to be significant. If they are valid, it seems likely that redshifts may not be due to an
<br>
expanding Universe, and much of the current speculation on the structure of the Universe may require
<br>
re-examination. The significant data, however, were necessarily obtained at the very limit of a
<br>
single instrument … therefore the results must be accepted for the present as suggestive rather than
<br>
definitive. The problem is essentially one for the 200-inch.”
<br>
<p>The new 200-inch telescope at Mt Palomar would give him the tools to carry out that test.
<br>
<p>“We may predict with confidence that the 200-inch will tell us whether the redshifts must be accepted
<br>
as evidence of a rapidly expanding Universe, or attributed to some new principle of Nature. Whatever
<br>
the answer may be, the result will be welcomed as another major contribution to the exploration of
<br>
the Universe.&quot;  He carried out the test, and got a definitive result, but it was not welcomed.
<br>
<p>In [the aptly named] “The Problem of the Expanding Universe,” in the section “The Interpretation of
<br>
the Red Shifts,” Hubble writes:
<br>
<p>“The investigations were designed to determine whether or not red shifts represent actual
<br>
recession.   In principle, the problem can be solved; a rapidly receding light source appears fainter
<br>
than a similar but stationary source at the same momentary distance.... For velocities of a few miles
<br>
or a few hundred miles per second, the dimming factor is negligible. But for the extremely distant
<br>
nebulae, where the apparent recessions reach tens of thousands of miles per second, the effects are
<br>
large enough to be readily observed and measured…Since the intrinsic luminosities of nebulae are
<br>
known, their apparent faintness furnishes two scales of distance, depending upon whether we assume
<br>
the nebulae to be stationary or receding. If, then, we analyze our data, if we map the observable
<br>
region, using first one scale and then the other, we may find that the wrong scale leads to
<br>
contradictions or at least to grave difficulties.”
<br>
<p>“Such attempts have been made and one scale does lead to trouble.  It is the scale which includes the
<br>
dimming factors of recession, which assumes that the universe is expanding…All of these data lead to
<br>
the very simple conception of a sensibly infinite, homogeneous universe of which the observable
<br>
region is an insignificant sample.” [Edwin Hubble, “The Problem of the Expanding Universe,” American
<br>
Scientist, Vol. 30, No. 2, April 1942, (p.111), pp. 99-115.]
<br>
<p>So Hubble, from the outset, doubted that the redshift he observed represented recessional velocity.
<br>
He devised a way to further test whether redshifts are evidence either of an expanding universe or of
<br>
some hitherto unknown principle of nature.  His observations led him to conclude these redshifts he
<br>
observed were NOT caused by recessional velocity, but by some other cause.
<br>
<p>While a receding source will cause emitted light to be redshifted, there are other possible
<br>
interpretations of this redshift, the main one being the &quot;tired light&quot; hypothesis, according to which
<br>
the redshift is produced by light losing energy as it travels through space. Hubble came to accept
<br>
that cosmological redshifts for the most part are indicators of distance, not velocity. He felt that
<br>
the data was in better agreement with light having a loss of energy to the intervening medium
<br>
proportional to the distance it travels through space by what he called &quot;a new principle of nature.”
<br>
<p>But a few months later, on 28th September, 1953, Hubble died in San Marino, California; and his new
<br>
research was buried with him.
<br>
<p>So much so that a few years later Hubble's work was summarized in epitaphs such as the following:
<br>
<p>&quot;More than ten years were to pass (after the expanding hypothesis had been put forward by De Sitter)
<br>
before the observations made by the American astronomer Edwin Hubble were to establish beyond all
<br>
reasonable doubt that the Universe was expanding&quot; [W. Bonnor, The mystery of the expanding universe,
<br>
Boringhieri, 1967, p. 2.] .
<br>
<p>&quot;Hubble's Law. The most serious blow to the stationary state of the universe … came from Hubble's
<br>
measurements of the velocity of the galaxies … after a series of painstaking measurements, Hubble
<br>
discovered that on average a galaxy recedes from us at a velocity proportional to the distance …
<br>
Hubble's discovery immediately destroys the idea of a stationary, unchanging universe, Aristotelian
<br>
one might say … So, as is indicated by Hubble's Law, 20 thousand million years ago the galaxies were
<br>
presumeably all amassed at the same point&quot;, etc. [T. Regge, Cronache dell'universo, Boringhieri,
<br>
1981, p. 44] .
<br>
<p>Hubble's law anchors Big Bang cosmology to the real world.
<br>
<p>But Hubble did not observe the galaxies zooming off into the far distance. Their recessional
<br>
velocity, and their distance represents a complicated inference, an intellectual leap.
<br>
<p>For more than a decade, the American astronomer Halton Arp has drawn the attention of the
<br>
astronomical community to places in the sky where the expected relationship between redshift and
<br>
distance simply fails. Embarrassingly enough, many quasars seem bound to nearby galaxies. The results
<br>
are in plain sight: there on the photographic plate is the smudged record of a galaxy, and there next
<br>
to it is a quasar, the points of light lined up and looking for all the world as if they were equally
<br>
luminous.
<br>
<p>These observations do not comport with standard Big Bang cosmology. If quasars have very large
<br>
redshifts, they must (according to Hubble's law) be very far away; so if they seem nearby, then they
<br>
must be FANTASTICALLY luminous! As bright as 1000 simultaneous supernovas! Yet their temperature
<br>
remains that of ordinary stars as exhibited by emission spectra of metallic ions that can only exist
<br>
at a limited range of temperature. They are known to be about stellar size since they vary in
<br>
brightness on a scale of a few minutes to seconds. By insisting on interpreting quasar red-shifts as
<br>
indicating great velocity and great distance, cosmologists have created a monster. How can they stay
<br>
so bright at such a low temperature in such a small volume? They can't. They must be nearby, and
<br>
their redshift is NOT due to their velocity. The tight tidy series of inferences that has gone into
<br>
Big Bang cosmology, like leverage in commodity trading, works beautifully in reverse.
<br>
<p>The American mathematician I.E. Segal and his associates have studied the evidence for galactic
<br>
recessional velocity over the course of twenty years, with results that are sharply at odds with
<br>
predictions of Big Bang cosmology. Segal is a distinguished mathematician, one of the creators of
<br>
modern function theory and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He has incurred the
<br>
indignation of the astrophysical community by suggesting broadly that their standards of statistical
<br>
rigor would shame a sociologist.[!] “Big Bang cosmology,” he writes, “owes its acceptance as a
<br>
physical principle primarily to the uncritical and premature representation of [the redshift-distance
<br>
relationship] as an empirical fact.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hubble's law embodies a general hypothesis of Big Bang cosmology--namely, that the universe is
<br>
expanding--and while the law cannot be established by observation, observation can establish that it
<br>
may be false. A catalogue of 780 references to redshift observations inexplicable by the Doppler
<br>
effect was published in 1981 by K. J. Reboul under the title, &quot;Untrivial Redshifts: A Bibliographical
<br>
Catalogue.&quot; Many other papers indicate that non-velocity redshifts have been observed, for example a
<br>
lengthy 1989 review article by the Indian astrophysicist J. V. Narlikar. [J. V. Narlikar, 1989,
<br>
&quot;Noncosmological Redshifts&quot;, Space Science Reviews, Vol: 50.]
<br>
<p>Recent astronomical discoveries pose an additional and very serious problem for the Big  Bang theory.
<br>
Larger and larger structures are being found to exist at greater and greater redshifts, indicating
<br>
their existence in the increasingly distant past.  In 1988, Simon Lilly of the university of Hawaii
<br>
reported the discovery of a mature galaxy at the enormous redshift of 3.4; that is, the amount of the
<br>
redshift for any spectral line from the galaxy is 340 per cent of the line's proper wavelength (Lilly
<br>
1988). This puts the galaxy so far in time that the Big Bang scheme does not allow sufficient time
<br>
for its formation! At a news report on Lilly's work in Sky &amp; Telescope expressed it, &quot;The appearance
<br>
of a mature galaxy so soon after the Big Bang poses a serious threat . . .&quot; (Aug. 1988, p. 124).
<br>
<p>In 1989 came the discovery of the &quot;Great Wall&quot; of galaxies, a sheet of Galaxies 500 million
<br>
light-years long, 200 million light-years wide, and approximately 15 million light-years thick, with
<br>
the dimensions of the structure being limited only by the scale of the survey (Geller and Huchra
<br>
1989). It is located between 200 and 300 million light-years from Earth. In an interview with the
<br>
Boston Globe (Nov. 17 1989), Margaret Geller of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
<br>
offered some frank comments on the implications of her discovery: “The size of the structure
<br>
indicates that in present theories of the formation of the universe something is really wrong that
<br>
makes a big difference,…No known force could produce a structure this big in the time since the
<br>
universe was formed&quot;, She said.
<br>
<p>Other interesting observations regarding the reshift are the so called K-effect, and our sun’s excess
<br>
red-shift.
<br>
<p>IMHO, the universe is infinite in space and time.
<br>
<p>Hubble was right, the redshifts he observed were due to some other factor than recessional velocity.
