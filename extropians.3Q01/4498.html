FYI Here's an interesting article from Design News:

AK has high hopes for hygienic steel
<br>
By Greg Farnum, Metals Editor
<br>
<p>Detroit - Who would want to use steel to kill germs?  AK Steel
<br>
(Middleton, OH) is hoping that  American consumers will, and betting
<br>
they will choose its AgION-coated stainless and carbon steels to do it.
<br>
<p>AgION, an antimicrobial compound that kills bacteria, mold and fungus,
<br>
is blended with an epoxy resin and roll coated or electrostatically
<br>
applied to the surface of the steel.  It can keep on killing for
<br>
decades, depending on the formulation.  That sounds like a good idea to
<br>
Frigidaire, which will soon begin marketing refrigerators and other
<br>
appliances made with AK's AgION-coated steel. Manufacturers of air
<br>
conditioning systems, ice-making machines and other products are also
<br>
interested, and according to Britain's Financial Times, AK is also
<br>
talking with a major fast food company.
<br>
<p>How does AgION work?  Basically it's a combination of silver, which has
<br>
long been known to have antimicrobial properties, and zeolite, a mineral
<br>
which for the last two decades has formed the active ingredient in a
<br>
variety of household odor and mildew removal products.  The primary
<br>
compound, silver zeolite, is manufactured by the Sinanen company of
<br>
Japan, then formulated into a variety of application-specific compounds
<br>
by AgION Technologies LLC of Wakefield, MA.  It's a very porous
<br>
compound, allowing moisture from the atmosphere to enter the coating and
<br>
initiate an ion exchange - that is, silver ions are pulled from the
<br>
AgION and replaced with sodium ions from the atmosphere.  This ion
<br>
exchange takes place in a slow, controlled fashion, and, as mentioned
<br>
above, can continue for years.
<br>
<p>These silver ions, dancing on the coated surface of the steel, are
<br>
poison to microbes, attacking them in three possible ways: after being
<br>
ingested by the microbe they can destroy the organism's cell wall;
<br>
through an oxidation process, the ions can cause cellular respiration to
<br>
be blocked, suffocating the microbe; and the silver ions can bind to
<br>
certain locations on the microbe's DNA structure, preventing cell
<br>
replication. 
<br>
<p>Strong stuff.  Is it safe?  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
<br>
thinks so - it has approved its use, though with more modest claims. 
<br>
The EPA recognizes AgION as effective in preventing the growth of the
<br>
bacteria, mold and fungus that cause odor and stains; they have not yet
<br>
signed off on claims that it kills germs that cause illness.  The Food
<br>
and Drug Administration has approved AgION for use in plastic film used
<br>
to wrap food.
<br>
<p>Longer range, there is the question of antibiotic resistance, a growing
<br>
problem in our new century.  Will the spread of AgION-coated material
<br>
help make pesky microbes even more resistant to our medicines?
<br>
<p>AK Steel and AgION Technologies don't think so.  They note that the
<br>
antibiotic pills your doctor gives you to fight infection are organic
<br>
microbials.  These attack one particular &quot;site&quot; on the targeted
<br>
organism.  Inorganic microbials like AgION's silver zeolite, on the
<br>
other hand, attack multiple sites.  That's important because, as AK
<br>
Steel explains in a backgrounder on the subject, &quot;resistance occurs when
<br>
a microorganism develops a mechanism to counteract the mechanism used by
<br>
the antimicrobial.  For example, resistance to penicillin was caused
<br>
when certain strains of bacteria produced an enzyme that clipped the
<br>
penicillin molecule in half, rendering it ineffective. The probability
<br>
of developing resistance to a single mechanism used by an antimicrobial
<br>
is much higher than that of developing resistance to the multiple
<br>
mechanisms employed by inorganic antimicrobials.&quot;
