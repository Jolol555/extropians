<p>The US will be already immunized, of course.  And it'll be
<br>
ahead of the curve technologically compared to more closed
<br>
societies (of the type that would want to do such a thing)
<br>
because open societies engender technological progress.  &quot;It
<br>
can be used against us,&quot; is an often heard dismissal.
<br>
Consider the enemy equivalent of a recently suggested idea:
<br>
airdropping copies of the Koran into the US!  Imagine the
<br>
sudden conversions!  The word of Allah would spread like
<br>
wildfire!  (Of course, that would never happen; the US is
<br>
chock full of rational thinkers, good Christians every one.)
<br>
Any idea *that will work* can be used against us, most won't
<br>
for practical reasons (lack of resources, for example).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seriously, I can't see what makes this &quot;solution&quot; extropian.
</em><br>
<p>Gusto!  (Note: humour.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is not based on any consideration of the rights of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people or their self-direction,
</em><br>
<p>It's clearing mental logjam.  As I mentioned previously I'm in
<br>
the process of reconsidering the degree to which &quot;individual
<br>
rights&quot; and &quot;self-direction&quot; make sense with regard to humans
<br>
and their many foibles.  I'm sure you'd agree that many of us
<br>
occasionally need a shove in the right direction to break out
<br>
of whatever psychological rut is holding us back, it's just a
<br>
question of how big a shove is too big a shove.  (I should
<br>
note that I consider even simple, naive ideas like airdropping
<br>
&quot;How to be a Rational Thinker&quot; pamphlets somewhat of a shove
<br>
located *somewhere* on the same continuum as doping them up.)
<br>
I *do* think that there's a fundamental - even physical -
<br>
difference between the blind, irrationally held beliefs of the
<br>
religious zealot on the one hand and me, you, and the rest of
<br>
us highly-rational extropians, on the other.  However, I
<br>
think - as far as human minds go - one belief system is at
<br>
least as good as another.  The benefits of being a critical
<br>
thinker, especially, can only be appreciated in retrospect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; trust in open societies (last I checked, mind control did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not produce democracy, but maybe the Ministry of Truth has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changed that in the meantime)
</em><br>
<p>If we're going to &quot;democratize&quot; these countries as many have
<br>
suggested it's not going to be through democratic process
<br>
because such a thing has yet to be established.  It will most
<br>
likely be through the support of violent issurection.  It
<br>
seems to me that how an open society should treat the members
<br>
of a closed society is ill defined.  How we - the rational
<br>
ones - should treat those muddle-headed irrational types when
<br>
we *finally* wake up and realise that exposure to The Truth is
<br>
met with yawns is similarly ill defined.  These are, to me,
<br>
the same problem and the (provisional) solution in both cases
<br>
as best as I can ascertain is: however we like.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or rational thinking (it clouds rational thinking together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with badthink). ...
</em><br>
<p>I'm not entirely sure what you mean here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OK, I guess it was a joke anyway ...
</em><br>
<p>Semi-satirical and subtly so.  My fault.
