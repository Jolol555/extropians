<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Major study proves diet, exercise, Metformin delay adult onset diabetes
<br>
<p>A three-year study funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Center
<br>
for Disease Control and other sources has proven the value of lifestyle
<br>
intervention in the prevention of type 2 diabetes.  The drug Metformin also
<br>
reduced the risk of developing diabetes to a lesser extent than that of diet
<br>
and exercise.  The study is the first major study to confirm these benefits.
<br>
<p>The trial, known as the Diabetes Prevention Program, recruited 3,234
<br>
individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, a condition that frequently
<br>
predicts the development of diabetes, as well as other at risk individuals
<br>
sixty years of age and older, those with a first-degree relative with type 2
<br>
diabetes, and women who had been previously diagnosed with gestational
<br>
diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy.  Forty-five percent of study
<br>
subjects were from minority groups who have higher rates of diabetes.
<br>
<p>The participants were randomly assigned to receive the drug Metformin, a
<br>
lowfat diet and 150 minutes per week of exercise with a goal of weight loss,
<br>
or a placebo pill.  Those in the group with improved diet and exercise
<br>
reduced the risk of subsequent diabetes development by fifty-eight percent
<br>
and lost five to seven percent of their body weight.  Metformin reduced the
<br>
risk by thirty-one percent.
<br>
<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G Thompson stated, &quot;In view of the
<br>
rapidly rising rates of obesity and diabetes in America, this good news
<br>
couldn't come at a better time. So many of our health problems can be
<br>
avoided through diet, exercise and making sure we take care of ourselves. By
<br>
promoting healthy lifestyles, we can improve the quality of life for all
<br>
Americans, and reduce health care costs dramatically.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is not yet known how long these benefits will be effective at delaying
<br>
diabetes, but the researchers plan to follow the participants in order to
<br>
find out.  Data will also be analyzed to determine the effect of the
<br>
interventions on the prevention of cardiovascular disease, a frequent
<br>
complication of diabetes.
<br>
<p>Director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
<br>
Diseases, Dr Allen Spiegel, commented, &quot;Every year a person can live free of
<br>
diabetes means an added year of life free of the pain, disability, and
<br>
medical costs incurred by this disease.  The DPP findings represent a major
<br>
step toward the goal of containing and ultimately reversing the epidemic of
<br>
type 2 diabetes in this country.&quot;
<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Diabetes
<br>
<p>The cumulative effects of diabetes are systemwide. Because diabetes causes
<br>
both vascular and neurological damage, the end results are enormously
<br>
significant. This is true for diabetics of both major types. Be aware that
<br>
diabetics may feel healthy and unaffected while these effects are
<br>
developing. Type I diabetics, because of the greater number of years with
<br>
the disease and because of the higher blood sugar levels often seen, may
<br>
experience more damage at an earlier age. Poorly controlled Type II patients
<br>
may see similar damage, however. Even well-controlled diabetics can suffer
<br>
from some degree of these long-term complications:
<br>
<p>Kidney Failure
<br>
Though most common in Type I cases, circulatory dysfunction may lead to
<br>
difficulty or failure of this organ. Diabetes is the leading cause of
<br>
end-stage renal disease.
<br>
<p>Stroke
<br>
Diabetes is the major cause of strokes in the United States.
<br>
Amputation
<br>
Over 50% of amputations are diabetes related.
<br>
<p>Blindness
<br>
Diabetes is the number one cause of blindness in the United States.
<br>
<p>Cardiovascular disease
<br>
Diabetics are 2 to 4 times as likely to have heart disease as people without
<br>
diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association.
<br>
<p>Impotence
<br>
Among diabetics, both vascular and neurological damage causes high rates of
<br>
impotence.
<br>
<p>Neuropathy
<br>
Peripheral neuropathy (pain and numbness in the extremities, usually in the
<br>
feet and legs) is common in diabetes.
<br>
<p>There are several major avenues of treatment for diabetes. All presume that
<br>
the patient is taking a high-potency, easily assimilated,
<br>
multivitamin-mineral complex as a basis for other specific, symptom-targeted
<br>
supplements. The global objective of this approach is to limit, prevent, or
<br>
in some cases reverse the vascular and neural damage seen in diabetes.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Vanadyl sulfate 7.5 mg capsules
<br>
<p>European doctors often use vanadium salts to treat diabetes. Vanadium mimics
<br>
the effects of insulin in the body, thereby lowering serum glucose levels.
<br>
This enables some diabetics to use less insulin, or stop taking insulin
<br>
altogether. The form of vanadium used by most doctors to lower serum glucose
<br>
levels is vanadyl sulfate which is well assimilated by the digestive system.
<br>
Body builders have also found that vanadium has an anabolic effect by
<br>
improving the muscle to fat ratio.
<br>
<p>Do not experiment with vanadium products unless you have a glucose meter to
<br>
monitor your blood glucose, since it is possible for vanadium in conjunction
<br>
with insulin and other diabetic products to produce a dangerous hypoglycemic
<br>
state.

<br>
<p>Super alpha-lipoic acid capsules
<br>
<p>When alpha lipoic acid was first isolated in the early 1950's, it was
<br>
tentatively classified as a vitamin because of its vitamin-like properties.
<br>
The method by which alpha lipoic acid is synthesized within the body has not
<br>
yet been fully characterized, but its precursors appear to be octanoate and
<br>
the sulfur amino acid, cysteine. Recent findings show that both alpha lipoic
<br>
acid and its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) function as potent
<br>
antioxidants within the body, and that both these compounds may be effective
<br>
in preventing and treating the complications of diabetes and, perhaps, aging
<br>
itself.
<br>
<p>In clinical studies to date with alpha lipoic acid, there have been no
<br>
reported serious adverse side effects, even at the high doses used to treat
<br>
diabetics and patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. Among the
<br>
mild, reversible side effects found in some patients have been allergic skin
<br>
reactions and possible hypoglycemia in diabetics.

Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw's Life Extension News, July 2001
<br>
<p>This newsletter is written by scientists Durk Pearson &amp; Sandy Shaw for other
<br>
scientists studying aging and for interested physicians and laypersons, as

well as for lawyers interested in promoting medical freedom of choice and
<br>

<br>
<p>FDA Says No to Drug Imports
<br>
<p>Although Congress authorized a rule allowing reimportation of prescription
<br>
drugs by individuals in last year's final budget reconciliation package (as
<br>
a way to help individuals buy drugs at the reduced prices often available in
<br>
other, poorer countries), it is &quot;looking doubtful&quot; that such a regulation
<br>
will be issued, according to Department of Health and Human Services
<br>
Secretary Tommy G. Thompson. The FDA claims that such freedom cannot be
<br>
allowed while the agency is unable to certify that the drugs coming back
<br>
into the country are safe and are the same drugs that were exported. This is
<br>
a fine excuse to protect their pharmaceutical company clients from price
<br>
competition and to ensure the continued availability of six figure salary
<br>
jobs at pharmaceutical companies for former FDA officials.
