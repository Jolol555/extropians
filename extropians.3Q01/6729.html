<p>CMOS cameras are tiny and use almost no power at all. The real trick would 
<br>
be the optics. You would have to use extreme telephoto and have a wide 
<br>
angle capability too.  Telephoto to see the people from across a valley; 
<br>
wide angle for navigation. They are so cheap to make and so light, it would 
<br>
probably be worth having 2 of them.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;power source
</em><br>
<p>Possibly solar recharging of lightweight lithium polymer batteries, which 
<br>
are being developed right now... I think a company called NRGCELLS in 
<br>
Singapore?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;and transmitter  that could communicate either with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;high-flying aircraft, balloon, or a satellite?
</em><br>
<p>You could send in short bursts, with the info compressed beforehand to 
<br>
reduce the amount of time &amp; power needed for the transmission. High 
<br>
frequency transmission could be focussed upward for 2 reasons: that gets 
<br>
most of the energy to where you want it instead of spraying it all around 
<br>
wastefully, and it makes it much less likely to be intercepted.
<br>
<p>I am not sure what is the best receiver. Satellites are already up there 
<br>
but they are a looooong way up. Most satellites may move too fast to be 
<br>
useful for focussed transmissions (though a short, sharp burst may still 
<br>
get around that). Geostationary satellites have an advantage there, though 
<br>
at that distance from the equator the devices would mostly be useful on 
<br>
southern slopes. A balloon is a sitting duck unless it has no radar 
<br>
signature and is small enough to be invisible from the ground. It could 
<br>
also use nonreflecting clear plastic for the gas bag (think household 
<br>
&quot;invisible&quot; sticky tape). But if there is a wind then it just blows away. I 
<br>
don't know enough about high-flying aircraft.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I understand that the climate is arid to semi-arid which means lots of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sunshine.
</em><br>
<p>Lack of moisture in the air means very high frequency (microwave?) 
<br>
transmissions work well.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I wonder how small you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could get a rechargeable battery and solar panel?
</em><br>
<p>I have a pocket calculator which I bought more than a decade ago (and I 
<br>
still use) which uses a solar panel of 4 cells, each 1 cm square. At that 
<br>
size, 1x4cm, it would fit on the back of a good sized locust. Batteries? I 
<br>
have hearing aids which use very small batteries. Granted they are not 
<br>
rechargeable, but the battery in my PalmVx is, and that computer is a low 
<br>
power marvel, running easily for weeks between rechargings, depending on 
<br>
how heavily I use it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If you could make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things as small as, say, large pebbles, and if you could figure out some way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to get them safely down--maybe they could be designed to glide--you could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distribute the things in likely areas. Maybe use the planes to find areas in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which to drop the pebble-gliders.
</em><br>
<p>That is certainly smaller than I was thinking, but it would make them less 
<br>
obtrusive. I am not sure how far research into such tiny robots is going. 
<br>
The larger seagull sized ones are quite feasible with today's technology.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
