<p>Funny thing is, Harvey, is that groups like this generally rent their
<br>
mail lists from the major parties, as well as from state lists of
<br>
registered voters, and mail lists quickly 'age', as people on them die
<br>
and move away, and as geographical names change. Many real people also
<br>
prefer to use 'boutique' city names that are not 'real' in the sense
<br>
they are generally oversized gated communities within a larger city.
<br>
<p>Because of this, when a group rents a list, they need to send it to a
<br>
list processor to eliminate duplicate names, process it against the
<br>
National Change Of Address (NCOA) database that the USPS publishes
<br>
(which also keeps track of deaths), and correct addresses that are
<br>
inaccurately entered by the party they were rented from.
<br>
<p>It sounds to me more like this group never sent their rented names to a
<br>
list processor for this cleanup work. What worries me is that this
<br>
indicates the degree to which dead people and fakers are on the lists of
<br>
registered voters around the country....
