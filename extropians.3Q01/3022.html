<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; A couple food stamps and a bottle of ripple.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;This latter bit is pretty typical of the racist comments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that appear so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; often on this list.  Does this kind of statement really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lend anything to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discussion other than advertise and promote the prejudices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the writer?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Here's a good example of the mis-use of the word Racism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why it gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thrown around at everything possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Racism is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a belief that race is the primary determinant of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traits and capacities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; race
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Discrimination on the other hand is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The act of discriminating, distinguishing, or noting and marking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; differences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Is it racist to say that blacks drink ripple? No. (this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't say anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about any race being inherently superior) Is it discriminatory? Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saying blacks, a race of people, drink ripple as a statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about race and about relative value (not to mention taste) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very much rascist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conflating discrimination with noting differences is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contemptible attempt to avoid facing an ugly remark.  It ignores
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other meaning of the term:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3 a : the act, practice, or an instance of discriminating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; categorically rather than individually b : prejudiced or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prejudicial outlook, action, or treatment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - samantha
</em><br>
<p>Here a better definition:
<br>
<p>Definition 1. the theory or opinion that a certain race or races of people,
<br>
usu. one's own, are superior to others because of certain inborn
<br>
characteristics.
<br>
Definition 2. any policy or practice based on such a theory or opinion.
<br>
<p>This definition you provided (number 3 no less) is a modern invention and
<br>
doesn't exist in dictionaries that predate political correctness. Racism
<br>
(note the &quot;ism&quot; part) is the belief that one race is inherently superior
<br>
because of genetic reasons. Discrimination is NOT racism... If I own a
<br>
Hooters restaurant and I don't want big fat blobby men serving as
<br>
waitresses, I have discriminated on them, not because of race but other
<br>
attributes. So we see its possible to discriminate on things other then
<br>
race. This shows that at least definition b is in fact false.
<br>
<p>My whole point is to get definitions clear. If you cant tell the difference
<br>
between racism, discrimination, bigotry, prejudice... there's no way to
<br>
communicate clearly and logically. I'm not advocating anything except being
<br>
exact and specific as possible about words, especially when discussing
<br>
something so emotional as this issue.
<br>
<p>If &quot;your&quot; definition is exactly correct, then all discrimination is racism.
<br>
I discriminate who will baby-sit my children, what I eat, where I work and
<br>
none of it has anything to do with race. Words denote concepts, so what word
<br>
are we to now use to denote prejudice that isn't associated with race? I
<br>
could just use the word racism to cover all instances of discrimination, but
<br>
we can see how that wouldn't work, anymore then the reverse does. Keep your
<br>
concepts focused and tight and its much easier to communicate, when you yell
<br>
racism at every little negative association even closely related to race,
<br>
you dilute the actual meaning of the word racism.
<br>
<p>So, to be exact, his statement about ripple is NOT racist, the statement
<br>
doesn't convey the idea that any particular race is genetically superior. It
<br>
is an unfair overgeneralization or a patently false mischaracterization.
<br>
Would a racist say this? Yes, but its also possible for someone to say this
<br>
that doesn't believe that blacks are genetically inferior but instead are
<br>
suffering cultural problems that stem from slavery, economic conditions or
<br>
because of planetary alignment. Also note he didn't say that &quot;All&quot; blacks
<br>
drink ripple. You added that. His problem was not being specific enough. If
<br>
he had said that there is a greater chance that older black men have a
<br>
higher chance of drinking ripple then any other like demographic, then his
<br>
statement could have been factually correct.
