<br>
<em>&gt; Does this mean your severed head on life support is not you?
</em><br>
<p>Think about it. __Whose__ severed head would it be?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or, with less drama, if you went paragliding, and fractured your C6
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vertebra, thus severing any direct (anything hormonal would lack the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bandwidth) neural connection to your &quot;second brain&quot;, you'd become someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else?
</em><br>
<p>You know better than that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (I don't disagree that you need as much context as can get, but as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well know, a whole body is not only more expensive than a neuro, but is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also paid by a neuro of less quality. Given that you *know* there is some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heavy information erasure going on in your noggin while it is being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuropreserved, are you really willing to risk more brain damage for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very dubious hypothesis?).
</em><br>
<p>Definitely not! I'd sooner invest in Eliezer's neighborly golem than in
<br>
neuropreservation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How much braindamage would you be willing to tolerate for perserving your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appendix?
</em><br>
<p>Well, obviously the appendix is an entirely different matter, since it is
<br>
completely expendable.
<br>
<p>©¿©¬
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, and ego.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
