<p>Pluralism in Science: A Statement
<br>
<p>Scientific knowledge is incurably pluralistic. It requires systematic study
<br>
of the world at every level of complexity, from quarks to quagmires to
<br>
quangos. But present-day views of science are unhealthily polarised. Those
<br>
who assert that science can completely discover reality are opposed by
<br>
those
<br>
who insist that scientific knowledge is simply a social construct. Each
<br>
side
<br>
dismisses intemperately the views of the other.
<br>
<p>In practice, however, most working scientists take neither of these extreme
<br>
positions. They are aware that established scientific procedures ultimately
<br>
rely on human judgements, but are confident that they produce peculiarly
<br>
credible and reliable bodies of knowledge. They also realise that although
<br>
the scientific account of the world is remarkably extensive and detailed,
<br>
it
<br>
misses out many vital features of human existence.
<br>
<p>This attitude is not just a pragmatic compromise between irreconcilable
<br>
opposites. It is a coherent conception of science, implicit in much recent
<br>
philosophical, sociological and historical thinking. Its strength lies
<br>
precisely in its inner tensions. It recognises that:-
<br>
- The various sciences – physical, biological, social, and so on – do not
<br>
have in common a unique research ‘method’: yet they all strive to account
<br>
for a great variety of shared human experiences in terms of the same
<br>
‘external’ world.
<br>
- From their research findings scientists often infer the existence of
<br>
entities whose properties they cannot directly observe: yet these
<br>
theoretical
<br>
constructs are not accepted as valid until they have survived critical
<br>
testing for consistency with  empirical experience.
<br>
- Scientific knowledge is presented as impersonal and universal, as if true
<br>
by logical necessity: yet it is produced by named individuals working
<br>
together in research communities, whose collective criticism renders it
<br>
highly credible.
<br>
- Research communities are peculiarly specialised and self-contained: yet
<br>
(provided they are not captured by political or commercial interests) they
<br>
are open and transparent.
<br>
- Science is often regarded as indisputable and impartial: yet it is always
<br>
corrigible and never entirely objective.
<br>
- Like geographers, scientists ‘map’ the world in different ways for
<br>
different purposes. These ‘maps’ often overlap: yet there is no proof they
<br>
can be extended and unified into a ‘theory of everything’ that covers all
<br>
reality.
<br>
<p>In particular, the behaviour of compound entities, such as living
<br>
organisms,
<br>
cannot be ‘reduced’ to the properties of their constituents, such as
<br>
chemical atoms. And human beings are the most complicated of all organisms.
<br>
Any aspect of human life can be made the subject of rational inquiry.
<br>
Science
<br>
does not have a monopoly on facts. History, geography and everyday
<br>
experience
<br>
give us facts that are just as certain. Would-be scientific discourse is
<br>
not
<br>
a suitable tool for understanding the moral, aesthetic and religious
<br>
aspects
<br>
of life. It is no disgrace to science that, for all these purposes we need
<br>
to
<br>
use other ways of thinking.
