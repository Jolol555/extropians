</em><br>
<em>&gt; You know, Lee, after reading your replies to some posts for the last few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weeks, I note that you tend to take what people write very literally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Speaking for myself, I often take poetic license in trying to impart the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essence of what I am trying to say - sometimes what I write is meant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figuratively, not literally.  In your reply above, you are asking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;what possible incentive&quot; would a person have to lie awake at night thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about ... farm workers?   I was simply suggesting a &quot;looking at the forest&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach to your inspiring story about heroic supermarket marketeers.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I had begun by speaking literally about the supermarket manager
<br>
who literally did think on and off all day long (and conceivably even
<br>
for a while after he or she retired) about improving the supermarket.
<br>
You seemed to respond in turn.  That is, I interpreted your remark to
<br>
mean, literally, that someone would also dwell on the problems of the
<br>
farm workers to the extent that they might also keep thinking (on and
<br>
off) all day long and even unto bed about the issues.  So I asked you
<br>
what incentive people would have to do that.  Hal Finney responded by 
<br>
pointing out that we would expect the growers to have such concerns
<br>
(provided that certain conditions were met).  I don't quite see how
<br>
I was being overly literal.  And if I was, then so perhaps was he?
<br>
<p>I do not think that you are alone in resorting to imagery and metaphor
<br>
to attempt to communicate your ideas.  It seems to me (though I could
<br>
be wrong) that I also write at a level that employs a number of means
<br>
of accurate communication.  Sure, some misunderstandings do occur.  My
<br>
favorite is when I'm asking a question to obtain information, but since
<br>
perhaps the tone of my post has been critical, this is taken as sarcastic
<br>
or rhetorical (I have since learned to always make it clear when I am
<br>
just asking for information).
<br>
<p>But someone else not long ago was accusing me of being overly literal,
<br>
and I wonder if perhaps there is some truth to the allegation that
<br>
some of us indeed too heavily emphasize literalness when our object
<br>
is clarity, but please do recall that almost a thousand people may be
<br>
lurking the list at any one time, and lack of clarity often receives
<br>
swift punishment.  My style has also prompted people on two occasions
<br>
to ask if I was an AI, and on one occasion to seriously ask if I was
<br>
a quadriplegic (so unworldly my posts had evidently waxed).  Does
<br>
anyone have any guidelines, observations, or useful suggestions on
<br>
the topic of literalness?
<br>
<p>Being too &quot;literal-minded&quot; is a fascinating psychological phenomenon.
<br>
I've met a few people in my life that struck me as so, and I found
<br>
that I simply could not hold an intelligent conversation with them.
<br>
So it's actually quite interesting to hear that I (and possibly
<br>
some others) are seen by some as too literal-minded ourselves.
