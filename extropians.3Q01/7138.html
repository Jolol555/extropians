<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Please forward this e-mail to pilots, airlines,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; congressional reps, and at least 10 other people that fly

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WHICH AIRLINE WILL COMMAND AND CONTROL THE SKIES?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Las Vegas, Nevada:  Will it be American, United, TWA, Delta,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SouthWest, or some small airline carrier that steps up and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with one bold move commands and controls the American air
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passenger market?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dr. Ignatius Piazza, Founder and Director of Front Sight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Firearms Training Institute in Las Vegas Nevada knows that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first airline to arm pilots and co-pilots with handguns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to defend their cockpits, will immediately gain the market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; share of domestic and international flights.  Front Sight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Firearms Training Institute (See Press Release of September
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 12 entitled Free Gun Training For Commercial Pilots or visit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; www.frontsight.com Solution To World Trade Center/Pentagon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Attack) has offered to train commercial pilots and co-pilots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FREE OF CHARGE from every commercial airline that allows the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pilot and co-pilot to carry a gun on board to defend the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cockpit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Piazza states, &quot;The first commercial airline to make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement that they will arm their pilots and co-pilots with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a handgun will have the immediate and overwhelming support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 80 million gun owning Americans, the pilots, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public.  All a commercial airline needs to do is call me and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can start training their pilots tomorrow-- free of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charge.&quot;  Says Piazza, &quot;Front Sight knows the public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overwhelmingly supports arming pilots because since our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first press release of September 12, where we offered to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; train the pilots and co-pilots free of charge, we have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flooded with thousands of positive phone calls, letters, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e-mail from pilots, gun owners, and the public. 99.9%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive response to arm and train pilots. The first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commercial airline to do the right thing and take the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical step to protect their passengers, flight crews, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aircrafts will see their public stock value soar, their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flights fill to capacity, and gain the endless admiration of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flight passengers around the world.  I personally hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American or United make the first move as it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrate a will to turn the tables on terrorists and take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back control of the skies.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aaron Benedetti, a United Airlines co-pilot and Platinum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; member of Front Sight's Firearms Training Resort in Las
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vegas agrees. &quot;The fear of the American people is real. Air
</em><br>
<em>&gt; travel is down, way down and may never recover if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue disarming passengers and pilots,&quot; says Benedetti.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Airlines are laying off people by the thousands.  Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people do not know that Federal Aviation Regulation 108.11
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently allows airlines to arm their personnel with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handguns.  I hope United is the first to do so. United could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once again claim they fly the friendly skies and overnight,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corner the market on armed flights. I fully support arming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pilots and co-pilots and I have experienced Front Sight's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; training first hand.  It is the best in the world.  Front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sight's patriotism in providing training free of charge is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truly commendable.  It would be a shame for United not to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first airline to take advantage of it.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mark Donovan, a Southwest Captain and Bronze member of Front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sight's Firearms Institute hopes that SouthWest is the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to lead the way.  Donovan states, &quot;SouthWest clearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominates their market at this time and is rated #1 in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; customer service, but an upstart airline or one of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competitors could steal that away in a heartbeat with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single press release and rotation of their pilots through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Front Sight's training courses. FAR 108.11 allows SouthWest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to authorize it's pilots to carry a handgun on board to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protect their cockpits.  All it takes is the airline to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the decision.  SouthWest prides itself on Positively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Outrageous Service. What could be better service than to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insure our passengers safety with an armed and trained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pilot? It would make me proud to see SouthWest make the move
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first before someone else does.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lieutenant Bob Redmond, SWAT Commander of Nye County
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sheriff's Department concurs that Front Sight's training is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly what the commercial airliners need and that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should immediately begin sending their pilots to Front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sight. Redmond, who sends his SWAT officers to Front Sight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for firearms and tactical training states, &quot;Front Sight's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; training exceeds levels offered by most if not all law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforcement agencies throughout the country.  Front Sight's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; training is so good that I want every officer we have in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; department to attend every course Front Sight offers. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airlines sent their pilots to Front Sight, it would be like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having SWAT officers in the sky.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Paul Nelson, an American Airlines Co-pilot and reserve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police officer for the city of Pasadena believes that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to restore the confidence of the American public,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong and necessary steps must be immediately taken to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empower pilots as the last line of defense of passengers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aircraft.  Nelson emphatically states, &quot;Front Sight and FAR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 108.11 provide American Airlines with an easily initiated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and meaningful step to regain passenger confidence in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airline.  If we do not take this step, I fear that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public will never return to the skies as they once did.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nelson continues, &quot;American Airlines has a distinct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity to turn this tragedy into triumph and make our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domestic skies the safest in the world.  As soon as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; executives at American give the word, I am going to Front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sight! God bless them.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dr. Ignatius Piazza is no stranger to commanding an industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and gaining market share.  Front Sight entered the firearms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; training industry as an unknown in April of 1996. Under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Piazza's leadership Front Sight has experienced growth up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 300% per year and risen to the top of the industry. Front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sight now trains more students than all other shooting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schools combined.  Front Sight is currently developing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world class firearms training resort on 550 acres just 45
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minutes from Las Vegas.  Front Sight's staff of over 120
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firearms instructors provide handgun, shotgun, rifle,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; submachine gun, and tactical training to law enforcement and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law- abiding private citizens alike in a positive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supportive environment.  Front Sight, the only facility in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the country to offer free submachine gun courses, has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trained over 15,000 law-abiding citizens and law enforcement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; officers free of charge in the use of the Uzi submachine gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the last three years. Front Sight continues to offer its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free submachine gun course through the end of this year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Front Sight has been featured positively in every major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newspaper and on every major television network in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country. To date, Front Sight has accomplished its amazing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth and development with ongoing cash flow and without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debt financing or investment money.  Says Piazza, &quot;Front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sight stands ready, willing, and able to train commercial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airline pilots and co-pilots on a moment's notice.  Which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airline will be the one to command and control the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skies?&quot;  For more information visit Front Sight's web site
