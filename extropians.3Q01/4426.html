<p>Well, John, you do have a talent for finding logorrheic 
<br>
hooey. But no, humanistic psychology has nothing really
<br>
to do with Weil or Deepak. Sartre, one of the founders of
<br>
the disorganized movement, &amp; the very sweet Carl Rogers, 
<br>
arguably its most talked about &amp; imitated practitioner,
<br>
were not in the least new-agey. I have no doubt that you 
<br>
can go on &amp; on finding rants &amp; raves that smell like 
<br>
supports for this thing you or your friend have about Jung 
<br>
&amp; so on, &amp; you can find screwball doctors that call them-
<br>
selves humanists or wolfmen, but events do have real histories 
<br>
&amp; genuine connections. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Let me get back to the real world:
<br>
<p>Paul (not his real name) was 18 when brought to my
<br>
office by his parents. He had quit talking to them
<br>
some time before, &amp; in fact was speaking to only 
<br>
one person, another young man who had recently
<br>
successfully castrated himself with a razor blade. 
<br>
<p>The family was upper middle class, &amp; educated. 
<br>
Despite his visible, constant &amp; bone cracking 
<br>
anxiety, Paul was getting excellent grades at the
<br>
school where he was a senior. He was clean &amp;
<br>
properly dressed, but reeked a strange, metallic 
<br>
odor &amp; was drenched with sweat despite my air
<br>
conditioning. He came in the office with his parents,
<br>
sat down, &amp; completely ignored me, preferring to
<br>
stare intensely at the floor.
<br>
<p>I asked the parents if Paul had a car. No. I then
<br>
established that he had passed driver's training at
<br>
his high school. I asked his parents to immediately
<br>
buy the lad a mechanically sound vehicle, &amp; told
<br>
them to go to my lobby &amp; wait. I then stepped behind
<br>
John &amp; for about 30 minutes spoke as though I 
<br>
were him, about what I (i.e., he) was suffering,
<br>
imaging &amp; thinking. My performance was quite
<br>
emotional, as it might have been had the lad been
<br>
able to speak for himself.
<br>
<p>I then took Paul to the lobby, &amp; said in front of
<br>
him to his parents that I should be pleased to see 
<br>
Paul again, but if, &amp; only if, he drove by himself
<br>
to my office at an appointed time. It is entirely 
<br>
up to him, I said, handing him a card with the time 
<br>
of his next appointment. 
<br>
<p>Paul continued coming for 4 years. At the end of 
<br>
9 months, he began speaking to me &amp; I added
<br>
short group &amp; large overnight group experiences to 
<br>
his treatment. His friend also became my patient. 
<br>
Both were psychotic by anyone's definition. 
<br>
<p>For 2 years prior to seeing me a very famous person 
<br>
who was assassinated was living, but in a coma, in 
<br>
Paul's room. Paul hallucinated, fed, spoke to &amp; 
<br>
generally cared for his secret patient every day in 
<br>
every way. I was the first to hear about it, because 
<br>
after about a year with me Paul experienced trust for 
<br>
the first time in his memory. He peed &amp; defecated all 
<br>
over himself &amp; my carpet the very moment he realized 
<br>
he trusted me. I stocked deodorants &amp; cleaners for 
<br>
these occasions.
<br>
<p>When I last saw Paul he had graduated from college, 
<br>
was married with one child, was employed as a 
<br>
teacher &amp; seemed very happy. If we were to meet
<br>
him we'd notice that he is, hmmm, eccentric. His
<br>
range of vocal intonation is larger than we are 
<br>
accustomed to, &amp; he gesticulates slightly wildly &amp;
<br>
seems immensely involved in whatever he is going 
<br>
on about. I suspect the kids he teaches like him a lot,
<br>
because he is completely forgiving &amp; extremely 
<br>
funny. I take it for granted that he, like all humans, 
<br>
will undergo dark moments. But I think he will be
<br>
able to deal with any sort of hallucination. And should 
<br>
he start to be overwhelmed by anxiety, any psychiatrist
<br>
should be able to help him manage it with low doses of 
<br>
benign medication.
<br>
<p>Now, my point is: the theories &amp; notions of Freud, 
<br>
Jung, Skinner...etc., etc., ad nauseum are of them-
<br>
selves of no use or benefit to the Pauls of this world. 
<br>
Indeed, no theory yields benefit for them. Rather,
<br>
if they are to be helped, they need someone of 
<br>
sufficient cleverness &amp; charm to keep them coming to 
<br>
treatment, which consists primarily of intense social
<br>
learning. Literally, I walked Paul through the maze
<br>
of interpersonal experiences - 'encounters' is an apt
<br>
word - that provided him with the stuff with which to
<br>
make &amp; live a life of his own. He met perhaps 200
<br>
people at my clinic, including numerous therapists 
<br>
of all 3 genders (or is it 4, or 6) who worked with 
<br>
him in the groups. 
<br>
<p>I know therapists who present themselves as Freudians, 
<br>
Jungians, behaviorists &amp; so on who nonetheless are good 
<br>
at their craft because they do what works, more or less
<br>
as I am describing it, &amp; save their theories for armchair
<br>
exchanges with other professionals. 
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Soup
