<p>If someone has a problem with the claims of someone's posts, they should
<br>
be easily able to cite a rebuttal of the claims. I am sorry, but making
<br>
absurd claims doesn't negate the challengers responsibility to test the
<br>
claims. That IS what science is all about: claims should be verifiable,
<br>
repeatable, and it is only by failing to be able to verify or repeat the
<br>
claimed phenomenon that a challenger can dispute an absurd claim.
<br>
<p>Those involved in the gun rights world have had to deal with this,
<br>
contesting the validity of Emory University Prof. Michael Bellisiles'
<br>
book &quot;Arming America&quot; in which he claims that probate records from the
<br>
colonial period 'prove' that only a tiny minority of Americans owned
<br>
guns. By his previous reputation, his book gained much public credence
<br>
in the media and the liberal intelligentsia without anyone checking his
<br>
claims. It was only when some people went and actually examined the
<br>
records he cited that it was found that they did not correspond with his
<br>
claims at all, and quite to the contrary, a majority of American males
<br>
did own guns during that period. Extensive checking of his references
<br>
now shows that most of them are misrepresentations, fabrications, and
<br>
other sorts of academic fraud, to the point where many liberal scholars
<br>
have dismissed his work, and even the gun control groups admit his work
<br>
was 'seriously flawed'.
<br>
<p>We gun rights people could not just baldly say &quot;his conclusions are so
<br>
absurd and contrary to what we know to be the facts that we don't even
<br>
need to test his work&quot;, despite the fact that the overwhelming majority
<br>
of Americans believe as we do.
<br>
<p>Nor could we dismiss his work just because his work was quoted and
<br>
posted on anti-gun websites. The fact that they have an agenda that his
<br>
work supports did not immediately negate the validity of his claims.
<br>
That it was evident to pro-gunners that he was a fraud meant nothing, we
<br>
had to prove it.
<br>
<p>It was only when his references were shown to be fraudulent that his
<br>
work could be dismissed. THAT is how science works.
