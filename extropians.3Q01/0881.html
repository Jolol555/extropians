J. R. Malloy quotes Michael Shermer's attack on mediums.
<br>
<p>While no subscriber to this list would *defend* spiritual mediums,
<br>
is there anyone who thinks that they shouldn't be chastised,
<br>
debunked, exposed, criticized, and yes, even verbally attacked
<br>
as liars and charlatans?

<em>&gt; &quot;Crossing over&quot; to expose the tricks of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; popular spirit mediums
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By Michael Shermer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like all other animals, we humans evolved to connect the dots between events
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so as to discern patterns meaningful for our survival. Like no other animals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we tell stories about the patterns we find. Sometimes the patterns are real;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes they are illusions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A well-known illusion of a meaningful pattern is the alleged ability of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mediums to talk to the dead. The hottest medium today is former ballroom-dance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instructor John Edward, star of the cable television series Crossing Over and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; author of the New York Times best-selling book One Last Time. His show is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; popular that he is about to be syndicated nationally on many broadcast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How does Edward appear to talk to the dead? What he does seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indistinguishable from tricks practiced by magicians. He starts by selecting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; section of the studio audience, saying something like &quot;I'm getting a George
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over here. George could be someone who passed over, he could be someone here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he could be someone you know,&quot; and so on. Of course, such generalizations lead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a &quot;hit.&quot; Once he has targeted his subject, the &quot;reading&quot; begins, seemingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using three techniques:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Cold reading, in which he reads someone without initially knowing anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about them. He throws out lots of questions and statements and sees what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sticks. &quot;I'm getting a 'P' name. Who is this, please?&quot; &quot;He's showing me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something red. What is this, please?&quot; And so on. Most statements are wrong. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjects have time, they visibly shake their heads &quot;no.&quot; But Edward is so fast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they usually have time to acknowledge only the hits. And as behaviorist B. F.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Skinner showed in his experiments on superstitious behavior, subjects need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only occasional reinforcement or reward to be convinced. In an expose I did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for WABC-TV in New York City, I counted about one statement a second in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opening minute of Edward's show, as he riffled through names, dates, colors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diseases, conditions, situations, relatives and the like. He goes from one to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the next so quickly you have to stop the tape and go back to catch them all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Warm reading, which exploits nearly universal principles of psychology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many grieving people wear a piece of jewelry that has a connection to a loved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one. Mediums know this and will say something like &quot;Do you have a ring or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; piece of jewelry on you, please?&quot; Edward is also facile at determining the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause of death by focusing on either the chest or the head area and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working rapid-fire through the half a dozen major causes of death. &quot;He's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; telling me there was a pain in the chest.&quot; If he gets a positive nod, he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continues. &quot;Did he have cancer, please? Because I'm seeing a slow death here.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the subject hesitates, Edward will immediately shift to heart attack.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. Hot reading, in which the medium obtains information ahead of time. One man
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who got a reading on Edward's show reports that &quot;once in the studio, we had to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wait around for almost two hours before the show began. Throughout that time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everybody was talking about what dead relative of theirs might pop up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Remember that all this occurred under microphones and with cameras already set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether or not Edward gathers information in this way, mediums generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needn't. They are successful because they are dealing with the tragedy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finality of death. Sooner or later we all will confront this inevitability,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and when we do, we may be at our most vulnerable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is why mediums are unethical and dangerous: they prey on the emotions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the grieving. As grief counselors know, death is best faced head-on as a part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of life. Pretending that the dead are gathering in a television studio in New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; York to talk twaddle with a former ballroom-dance instructor is an insult to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the intelligence and humanity of the living.
