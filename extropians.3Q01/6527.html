<em>&gt; I give you the representatives of the 'just doesn't get it' category,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though I am almost too disgusted to send it. As revolting as their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atrocities were, at least the terrorists had the balls to make their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own statement, rather than callowly borrow the greatest tragedy of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time to spread hatred even further, and fill their own wallets.

<em>&gt; God Gave U.S. 'What We Deserve,' Falwell Says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By John F. Harris
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Washington Post Staff Writer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friday, September 14, 2001; Page C03
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Television evangelists Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, two of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most prominent voices of the religious right, said liberal civil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberties groups, feminists, homosexuals and abortion rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporters bear partial responsibility for Tuesday's terrorist attacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because their actions have turned God's anger against America.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give us probably what we deserve,&quot; said Falwell, appearing yesterday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the Christian Broadcasting Network's &quot;700 Club,&quot; hosted by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robertson.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Jerry, that's my feeling,&quot; Robertson responded. &quot;I think we've just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen the antechamber to terror. We haven't even begun to see what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can do to the major population.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Falwell said the American Civil Liberties Union has &quot;got to take a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of blame for this,&quot; again winning Robertson's agreement: &quot;Well, yes.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then Falwell broadened his blast to include the federal courts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others who he said were &quot;throwing God out of the public square.&quot; He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; added: &quot;The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God will not be mocked. And when we destroy 40 million little innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; babies, we make God mad. I really believe that the pagans, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People for the American Way -- all of them who have tried to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secularize America -- I point the finger in their face and say, 'You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helped this happen.' &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People for the American Way transcribed the broadcast and denounced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the comments as running directly counter to President Bush's call for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; national unity. Ralph G. Neas, the liberal group's president, called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the remarks &quot;absolutely inappropriate and irresponsible.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robertson and others on the religious right gave critical backing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bush last year when he was battling for the GOP presidential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nomination. A White House official called the remarks &quot;inappropriate&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and added, &quot;The president does not share those views.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Falwell was unrepentant, saying in an interview that he was &quot;making a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theological statement, not a legal statement.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I put all the blame legally and morally on the actions of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorist,&quot; he said. But he said America's &quot;secular and anti-Christian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment left us open to our Lord's [decision] not to protect. When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a nation deserts God and expels God from the culture . . . the result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not good.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robertson was not available for comment, a spokeswoman said. But she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; released a statement echoing the remarks he made on his show. An ACLU
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spokeswoman said the group &quot;will not dignify the Falwell-Robertson
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remarks with a comment.&quot;
