Miriam described what sounds like an interesting idea for a story and said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Anybody who feels like writing it as a script for the episode, be my guest. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;snip&gt; I am not really a great writer... Damien? Russell?
</em><br>
<p>We'll talk about all this offlist, methinks.
<br>
<p>On the D.A.R.E. subject more generally, I yield to no one (except maybe 
<br>
J.R.) in my fire-breathing atheism. However, I am a bit less cynical about 
<br>
religious believers (as opposed to the belief) than some others in this 
<br>
forum.
<br>
<p>I grew up in a middle-of-the-road, respectable working class household with 
<br>
mild Christian beliefs, but decided at a very early age - i.e. early primary 
<br>
school - that Christianity had about the same truth content as Greek or 
<br>
Norse mythology and would become moribund in exactly the same way over time. 
<br>
Hey, I *love* Greek and Norse mythology, but no one believes that stuff, not 
<br>
literally, not even the occasional neo-pagan that you run into.
<br>
<p>I did, however, have a &quot;born again&quot; experience when I was about 12 or 13 and 
<br>
went on to spend the next seven or so years - basically my adolescence - 
<br>
struggling with my faith. In that time, I largely hung out in Christian 
<br>
semi-fundamentalist settings, including a goodly stint involved in 
<br>
Pentacostalism. Most of my friends were also baby Christians.
<br>
<p>The real killer of my faith was that I could not solve the problem of evil, 
<br>
despite my best endeavours - which I naturally expected to be superior to 
<br>
those of any previous philosophical or theological thinkers &lt;g&gt;.
<br>
<p>Together with a whole lot of other convergent factors, this led to my 
<br>
finally chucking it all in, intellectually and emotionally, when I was at 
<br>
university, just before my 20th birthday, and towards the end of a one-year 
<br>
stint as Deputy President of the Evangelical Union on my campus. It kinda 
<br>
cruelled any ambitions I had for the EU Presidency &lt;g&gt;.
<br>
<p>I've never lapsed back into any kind of religious faith. I actually find it 
<br>
liberating that there's no God or gods or externally imposed meanings and 
<br>
values out there.
<br>
<p>Two points:
<br>
<p>(a) despite some of the comments made on the list, I, as a religious 
<br>
believer *was* prepared to test my beliefs against rational criteria. I did 
<br>
not abandon those beliefs lightly but I did eventually abandon them, and 
<br>
essentially for philosophical reasons, however heart-rending I found the 
<br>
process of tearing myself away from born-again Christianity;
<br>
<p>(b) the people who were my friends or mentors during my adolescence were not 
<br>
bad or obviously deluded. Some of my friends have likewise gone over to the 
<br>
side of reason. Those who remain close friends of mine fit into this 
<br>
category. But the ones who retain a Christian faith still have my respect 
<br>
and affection. Some of them may be intellectual opponents, and not just over 
<br>
the issue of theism, but there are some good, intelligent and sincere people 
<br>
there. I don't expect everyone to share my relentless commitment to rational 
<br>
inquiry, much as I wish they would and believe that more of them would end 
<br>
up as transhumanists of some kind if they did.
<br>
<p>My only real enemies are those who argue (whether from a religious view or 
<br>
otherwise) for laws contraining the life of freedom and reason. Even then, I 
<br>
can handle a fair bit of opposition from kind-hearted, if misguided, people 
<br>
before I consider them enemies.
<br>
<p>Ascend!
<br>
