<p>Harvey, I think you are being a little harsh with regard to the management
<br>
of large companies.  The larger the company the more inertia you have
<br>
and the harder it is to turn-on-a-dime.
<br>
<p>Take the recent example of Lucent.  Once a great high-tech-company.
<br>
One whose managment failed to predict turns in their markets and bet
<br>
on the wrong development path.  My understanding is that the
<br>
market for their primary product, telco switch exchanges, dried
<br>
up over a couple of years; and they bet that very-high-bandwidth
<br>
optical equipment would be a large market when everyone went
<br>
with intermediate-bandwith equipment.
<br>
<p>Net result -- no sales and a big bloated manufacturing force.
<br>
Are you suggesting that they should have walked into their factories
<br>
a year ago and said &quot;Today we are going to make lightbulbs&quot;?
<br>
I think not.
<br>
<p>Because of the market treatment of those misjudgements, the stock took it
<br>
on the nose and then the engineer bleed started because their options were
<br>
so far underwater that it made no sense to stay.  The management at that
<br>
point is looking at having to take desperate measures or lose the guts
<br>
of the company.
<br>
<p>Management's solution -- lay off workers until your manufacturing
<br>
capacity matches your sales and sell off assets until your capital
<br>
is sufficiently great that you can weather the storm.
<br>
<p>The market looks for certain &quot;signs&quot; that management is doing something.
<br>
You can't make clear what your long term development strategy is without
<br>
giving the competitiors an edge.  It looks to me like announcing layoffs
<br>
is one of the few &quot;visible&quot; tools that managers have.
<br>
<p>Its quite a bit different from the situation in which you are managing a
<br>
private company or a startup where you can get all the shareholders in a
<br>
room and explain precisely what is being done.
<br>
<p>And for the people who think the President of the U.S. makes $140K,
<br>
that's a very old number.  As I posted in one of my other notes
<br>
its $400K.  Thats a small amount given the headaches of the job.
<br>
Thought the retirement benefits are pretty good.
<br>
<p>Robert
