<p><em>&gt; I don't discount the possibility that a &quot;fantastically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhanced&quot; me would feel differently than I do. But then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;fantastically enhanced&quot; me would  not be *me*.
</em><br>
<p>That's quite debatable.  I think that Anders has posted some
<br>
reasons to adopt the view that it wouldn't necessarily feel
<br>
differently from you.  Also, see Mike Perry's book &quot;Forever
<br>
For All&quot; for a thorough description.
<br>
<p>But if I do grant that point, it still hardly follows that
<br>
you need to become dissatisfied or bored with any particular
<br>
activity.  If you really think that it would be best to take
<br>
up motocross again, just remove the boredom that currently
<br>
attends the idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't doubt that human curiosity was a great asset essential 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to our survival and domination of the planet.  However, I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foresee that curiosity will ever be evolved out of us.
</em><br>
<p>After we control our own evolution, it will be our choice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you're not curious, what's the point?  *You* might want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to live just for the sake of living, but for me it's learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answers to new questions and experiencing something new.
</em><br>
<p>There will always be more to learn.  If not in the physical
<br>
universe, then in mathematics.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; At some point in time, whether its a hundred, a thousand, or a trillion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years into the future, I am bound to run out of new experiences, interesting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions, new frontiers.  I don't imagine any of us will ever be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; omniscient, so I suppose there will always be *something* new to learn or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some ultimate theory to disprove.  But once it starts getting to the point 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where it takes 99.9% of effort to make a 0.1% advance, no doubt about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it...I'm bored.
</em><br>
<p>As I say, you don't need to be unless you want to be.  Just turn down
<br>
the &quot;boredom&quot; knob if it's a problem.
<br>
<p>Don't forget the other thing that you can do forever (besides mathematics):
<br>
self-re-engineering for greater gratification, fulfillment, pleasure, 
<br>
satisfaction, meaningfulness, and joy.
<br>
<p>The fact that these don't sound so good right now is a mere illusion.
<br>
Almost by definition, they really are!  And you'll really love them.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Are you sure you want to move Zero to the Recycle Bin?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This file cannot be recovered.&quot;  Yes - delete.
</em><br>
<p>Never do that!!!  Fix whatever is wrong (which is damned hard
<br>
today, but won't be then) and move on.
<br>
<p>Lee  &quot;It is better to be alive than dead.&quot;
