<em>&gt; &gt;      When Worlds Collide: Quantum Probability From Observer Selection?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exciting as this is, I think the more likely possibility is the suggestion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the small worlds would be effectively eliminated by this influence,
</em><br>
<p>A reasonable guess.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The paper describes a simple case with one large and one small world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does the math still work if there are enormously more small worlds than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large ones, as I believe is expected to be the case?  Is it necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to consider the ratio of numbers of small to large worlds?
</em><br>
<p>The basic linear equation i dr/dt = rh-hr can be decomposed across more than two
<br>
worlds, and then you get the evolution of a world being the self term plus,
<br>
instead of the single interaction term as in the equations I gave, there is a sum
<br>
of terms like that for each of the other worlds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...  Presumably there are &quot;medium&quot; worlds where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probabilities are somewhat different from what they should be, worlds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low probability (say, one in a billion) but still much higher than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probabilities relating to environmental coherence effects ...
</em><br>
<p>If you make a billion measurements and your probability is one in a billion
<br>
relative to a max probability world, your measured frequency is *very* close to
<br>
that predicted by the Born rule.  I don't think you'd notice the difference.  If
<br>
you stare at a window and see the fraction of photons that come through, you are
<br>
implicitly making a vast number of measurements.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does the math still work in the case of an infinite dimensional set?
</em><br>
<p>Me, I don't trust results you get with infinities that aren't the limit of finite
<br>
results.  We only ever see a finite amount of data, and should seriously consider
<br>
the hypothesis that the world is finite as well.   All the decoherence analysis
<br>
I've seen looks at finite sets of states decohering.  Deutsch and others (eg &quot;many
<br>
minds interpretation&quot;) do try to play something like your infinite set game
<br>
though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In effect Robin's paper says that if all worlds make an equal contribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you can still get the Born probabilities (modulo the various caveats
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and assumptions).  This is a step forward as it is a simpler assumption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than others which have been made.  But I am not very comfortable with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this assumption (that all worlds should be counted equally).
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I follow you, but I think your discussion is only relevant for your
<br>
infinite case, right?  For a finite set of worlds, I think I'm fine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nevertheless, if an explanation like Robin's can work, it does seem to cut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the knot and eliminate much of the difficulty.  If stable observers can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist only in universes which match the predictions of QM, or if observers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in bizarre universes somehow nevertheless experience only sane events,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then there seems to be nothing left to explain and the issue is solved.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the hope is to have a simple mechanical solution that avoids most
<br>
philosophical complexities.
