<em>&gt; &gt; GMO choice being taken out of farmers' and consumers' hands.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Monsanto suing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; farmers to make them use its crop, buying up seed producers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This report bothers me on a couple of other points not mentioned directly in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the article.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Firstly, a farmer is being sued because he only planted some of his fields
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with GM crops.  The company refuses to believe it and wants to punish him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless he uses 100% GM crops.  This directly contradicts the plans of using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fractional planting to avoid breeding resistant pests.  To avoid breeding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resistant pests, farmers use some percentage of non-GM crops to allow some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-resistant pests to survive into the next generation.  This move by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Monsanto worsens the problem of resistant pests and prevents farmers from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to avoid the problem.
</em><br>
<p>Considering your earlier predeliction toward judging the information by
<br>
judging the source, Harvey, why don't you apply that same sort of bias
<br>
against this article's claims, since it's published on an anti-GMO
<br>
luddite website that, according to my browsing, embraces all sorts of
<br>
unscientific opinions and issues that depend upon religious faith.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Secondly, a farmer was sued for using GM crops even though he never planted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.  The cross-pollination from nearby farms converted his crops to GM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crops according to Monsanto.  This directly contradicts claims that GM crops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be controlled and won't escape or interfere with farmers who don't want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GM crops.  If GM crops (and their related legal patents) convert nearby
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural crops into GM crops, this implies that the Monsanto patent will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spread wider and wider until everybody has their genetic modifications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether they want them or not.  Despite our best efforts, the modifications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are being released in the wild, and it is taking over so-called natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These two points seem to contradict the claims by Monsanto that methods can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be used to prevent the breeding of resistant pests and to prevent the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncontrolled spreading of their genes into the wild.  Like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cross-contamination of GM corn products into other products that weren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed to contain any of the GM corn, these examples further demonstrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we cannot control the technology.  Although the science is sound, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the benefits are clear, the infrastructure is not capable of controlling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these inventions.  It appears that they can't be kept out of food if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desired, they can't be kept out of the wild if desired, and they can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used in a manner that won't breed resistant pests.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Although there is no scientific reason why this must be so, it appears that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the fears about GM foods are actually coming true.
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily true. What Monsanto is saying is that genetic markers of
<br>
the GMO crop is being found elsewhere on land not seeded with GMO
<br>
plants. They are not testing crops, they are testing the dirt, which
<br>
collects pollen from many sources. Just because there is pollen there
<br>
does not mean that the crops are breeding with it, AND just because the
<br>
genetic markers being detected are there does not specify that the
<br>
actual genes that produce the pesticides are being bred into non-GMO
<br>
crops. If the pesticide gene is a recessive gene, then its less likely
<br>
to be expressed if it isn't bred from two full GMO parent plants.
