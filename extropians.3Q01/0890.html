<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And if efforts to influence the public and mass media  are successful, we will need     to find common ground with those who are different in their world view!

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Greg Burch perceptively stated recently how the transcendant vision of       transhumanism does have a connection to the fondest hopes of &quot;aspiring to higher           things&quot; in religious though.

&nbsp;&nbsp;FM-2030 in his book, &quot;Are you a Transhuman?&quot; made a similar point about how     people in various ways have transhumanist aspects to their lives, even if on the     surface you would not think so.
