</em><br>
<p>There is the possibility of staging through Russia and Tajikistan, which
<br>
has had significant problems with Taliban infiltration over the border.
<br>
Pakistan, though, does have a longer history of cooperation with the US
<br>
(we have taken their side in every war they've had with India, and
<br>
supplied them with jets and armor against the Migs and Tuplolevs the
<br>
USSR sold the Indians) and there are supposedly some training bases for
<br>
Taliban in Pakistan that I'm sure we'd like them to shut down for us.
<br>
<p>The Russians see this as simply an extension of the Chechnya problem
<br>
they've been dealing with, with Chechens having committed similar
<br>
terrorist attacks in Moscow and other cities as well as murdering
<br>
moderate Chechens who collaborated with the Russians.
<br>
<p>The Chechen War they've been fighting does indicate the sort of
<br>
difficulties we are likely to face in a widespread war, though the
<br>
Russian weaponry is several generations behind the US, and they have
<br>
nothing like our C3I infrastructure. Their logistical situation is a
<br>
nightmare, and the quality of that which they do receive is also
<br>
pathetic.
<br>
<p>I am sure that the Russians are salivating at the chance to upgrade
<br>
their equipment and jump back on the US supply gravy train they had
<br>
during WWII.
