<p>Hey, yeah! Then you too could have the great fun described by Loree:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I gave very little thought to personal safety unless I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was in a known &quot;bad area&quot;.  I've had a few experiences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;since transition that scared [me].  Men following me...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;approaching me in a parking garage... making sexually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explicit remarks/requests/demands.  And all in areas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that I knew were &quot;safe&quot; before transition.
</em><br>
<p>That sounds so enviable.
