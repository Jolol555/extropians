<p><em>   &gt;Anyway, welcome to the list, Miriam!
</em><br>
<p>Damien Broderick
<br>
[another Aussie]
<br>
<p>================================================
<br>
Good on yer, Damien.
<br>
<p>Miriam, I'll have a bit more of a look at the URLs in your signature block 
<br>
when I get a moment.
<br>
<p>While us Aussies are bonding - hey, Damien's coming around here soon
<br>
accompanied by Barbara Lamar, who just about counts as an honorary Aussie 
<br>
these days- I'll just mention again that I haven't even been all that eager 
<br>
to label myself &quot;an extropian&quot; (my signature calls me a &quot;transhumanist&quot;).
<br>
<p>BUT, I have to say that I've read Max More's extropian principles again -
<br>
carefully - of late and I can't find anything at all that I seriously
<br>
disagree with. This is a very useful set of principles and elaborations:
<br>
they paint the picture of a distinctive cluster of philosophical attitudes, 
<br>
but they are flexible enough to allow for a  diversity of (for example, 
<br>
political) viewpoints.
<br>
<p>This brings me to a question to Max, or anyone else who knows the answer. 
<br>
Damien may also have some clues. Is there much, or any, formal philosophical 
<br>
literature around that examines, defines and/or critiques transhumanism? I 
<br>
mean such things as articles in academic journals devoted to philosophy or 
<br>
jurisprudence. I have some familiarity with relevant web sites and 
<br>
considerable familiarity with popular books, fiction and non-fiction, that 
<br>
explore the ideas that comprise transhumanism - those are not what I mean. 
<br>
I'm not aware of what (if any) more academic work would have to be read and 
<br>
cited if someone wanted to write about transhumanism in an academic 
<br>
philosophical context - in the sense that one must be familiar with and 
<br>
cite, say, Robert Nozick's work (and, say, G.A. Cohen's criticisms) if 
<br>
writing about libertarianism for an academic audience. Perhaps someone has 
<br>
an appropriate URL.
<br>
<p>Knowing the answer to this might help me and some others on the list with 
<br>
future projects.
<br>
<p>Thanks in advance to whoever.
<br>
<p>Ascend!
<br>
