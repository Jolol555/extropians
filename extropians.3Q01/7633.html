<p>I disagree.  You have to do the right thing for the right reasons.  Doing
<br>
the right thing for the wrong reasons is very dangerous and is bound to go
<br>
wrong sooner or later.  The idea that it's okay to convince someone of a
<br>
true conclusion using an invalid argument is the excuse used by
<br>
propagandists from environmentalists to rabbis whenever they have to remix
<br>
the facts a little (or a lot) in support of their arguments.
