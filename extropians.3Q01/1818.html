<p>Of course that is not what they are against. Instead they fight
<br>
against, I assume, a host of other things, in main, I suppose, the
<br>
tacit assumption that they do NOT own the country in which they live,
<br>
and that instead, the country in which they live should be operated
<br>
for the furtherment of business.  
<br>
<p>They fight, I assume, against the importation of non-citizens who will
<br>
compete against them for jobs. 
<br>
<p>They fight, I assume, against bringing in more and more people in
<br>
order to stoke the fires of business, to the betterment of those who
<br>
make a living buying, and to the degradation of the environment and
<br>
the quality of life.  Not too mention that many of the protestors do
<br>
not own property and probably see the chances of ever owning property
<br>
to be small.  They know that the imported labor will compete against
<br>
them for housing, too.  
<br>
<p>They fight, I assume, against turning their country into a livestock
<br>
ranch  that operates for the benefit of those that do own property,
<br>
and do have &quot;careers&quot;, etc....
<br>
<p>I say &quot;I assume&quot; because the motivations of these rioters are never
<br>
reported in the major media except in very vague generalities. Gee, I
<br>
wonder why not...
