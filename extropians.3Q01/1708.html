I'm going to wade in somewhere I should not be (making a
<br>
comment on philsophy) when the people on the list with
<br>
letters after their names (:-)) are far more qualified
<br>
than I to engage in this...
<br>
<p>Anyway, <a href="mailto:CurtAdams@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20Doctrine%20of%20Pope%20Asimov%20I&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10107211633540.1350-100000@server.aeiveos.com&gt;">CurtAdams@aol.com</a> wrote:

</em><br>
<p>The reason that most other people in the world view Extropians
<br>
as &quot;strange&quot; is, in part, because we can use phrases like
<br>
&quot;pancritical rationalism&quot; with a straight face.  Even I with
<br>
about 5 years of college and some minimal education in
<br>
philosophy cannot read that statement without having to
<br>
actually think about what it means.  And I shall not
<br>
even mention J.R.'s use of &quot;teratocarcinomas&quot;...  I know
<br>
what *that* means but I'll bet 2 ExtroPoints 50+% of the
<br>
list didn't...  And if the list didn't, well, ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, no, basing important beliefs on faith alone isn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent with extropianism.
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; Further, as principles based on the real world, they are open 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to change. 
</em><br>
<p>I think I have to disagree with these statements.  Some points
<br>
would be:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Beliefs are based on experience which isn't universal;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Experience is entirely subjective and cannot be negated by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anything in the &quot;real world&quot;; and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If the &quot;real world&quot; is open to change its entirely ficticious.
<br>
<p>For example it has been &quot;scientifically proven&quot; that males and
<br>
females process verbal information differently.  If they process
<br>
information differently, the internal personal experiences are different,
<br>
if their internal personal experiences are different men can never
<br>
invalidate the experience of a woman or vice versa.  While, it hasn't been
<br>
&quot;proven&quot;, I'd argue that this argument can be extended to every individual
<br>
because every individual has different foundational &quot;ties&quot; to which they
<br>
anchor visual and verbal communications.  Given that the anchors of each
<br>
individual must be different, all &quot;experiences&quot; are unique *and* valid.
<br>
An &quot;experience&quot;, it is *what* &quot;happened&quot; and was &quot;recorded&quot; from the
<br>
perspective of the individual to whom it occured.  The best you can do
<br>
is falsify a perspective is argue that they &quot;mis-sensed&quot; it (i.e. it was
<br>
an imagining or a dream that was not a reflection of external reality) or they
<br>
may have &quot;mis-interpreted&quot; it and as a result may be making mountains
<br>
out of molehills (e.g. coincidence with regard to astrology predictions).
<br>
<p>Because people will &quot;reflect&quot; on experiences, they will &quot;modify&quot; them
<br>
to match their expectations of what they could be interpreted as.  As
<br>
a result we misinterpret a lot of information and have a terrible time
<br>
communicating our &quot;beliefs&quot; to others (because they do not have the
<br>
same &quot;anchor set&quot; that we personally have).  That also why, as I'm
<br>
sure Greg could probably testify, &quot;witnesses&quot; are a double-edged sword.
<br>
<p>People on the list should be *very* careful to differentiate between
<br>
&quot;faith&quot; and &quot;experience-based&quot; beliefs.  You can convince me that
<br>
I've mis-sensed something, you can convince me that I've mis-interpreted
<br>
something, but you can never convince me that my experience is not
<br>
a reflection of my personal reality.  You *may* convince me that my
<br>
experience is in disagreement with the shared experience of a larger group
<br>
but then you have to get into serious reputation analysis discussion
<br>
as to whether that larger group is attempting to purge itself of
<br>
historically justified, but currently irrational, beliefs and provide
<br>
some demonstration that the system of beliefs you are promoting is
<br>
better able to deal with the personal, social and physical &quot;realities&quot;
<br>
simultaneously.  As I'm sure most Extropians would agree, &quot;quantity&quot;
<br>
is not better than &quot;quality&quot; but that doesn't help much when the
<br>
consumers can't afford (or don't want) your products.
