<p><em>&gt; Well, I don't know much about what else he has done, but - to be fair -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reason has been doing a good job with the longevity meme web
</em><br>
<em>&gt; site, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a great idea IMHO. I expect he'll be, perhaps among other things, a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; web-based activist for an accessible variety of transhumanism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and this site
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be a great resource as it fills in with more content.
</em><br>
<p>Beyond this, it should also be a spawning point for local activism and
<br>
social groups, promoting the growth of pro-life extension memes in our
<br>
society. All good stuff, all very necessary stuff. I know I'm restating
<br>
myself when I say we need to be out in the mainstream -- and accessible to
<br>
the mainstream -- to have a hope of achieving all that we want to achieve,
<br>
but it needs to be said often.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I encourage you to go and have a look at the site. It currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominated by Aussies, so it'd be good to see all you Poms, Yanks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc... er,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mean all you cultured, intelligent and upstanding British and American,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc, citizens... take part.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely! There must be some non-Australian writers out there willing to
<br>
have short articles on life extension, anti-aging or other appropriate
<br>
social topics published on the Longevity Meme website :) [Some have already
<br>
offered, and I do have a backlog of writings to run through, evaluate, or
<br>
help to rewrite].
<br>
<p>As to those of you who don't write much outside of e-mail, drop by the
<br>
forum!
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.longevitymeme.org/forum/">http://www.longevitymeme.org/forum/</a>
<br>
<p>There are a number of interesting discussions relating to life extension,
<br>
methods of getting society interested, the technology of building websites,
<br>
etc, going on in there...even a post from Keith Henson that arrived from out
<br>
of the blue. I'd love to hear viewpoints from the rest of you, and even a
<br>
single posting to a topic helps to encourage others to participate.
<br>
Community building is good!
<br>
<p>(And thanks to Russell for the kind words :)
