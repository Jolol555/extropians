Reason quoted Miriam
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; An odd thing though... all the stuff I read kept making, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seemed to me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a surprisingly simple mistake. You mention it again above: the idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the backup is a copy and is somehow distinct from a continuous &quot;genuine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you&quot;. The mistake is in thinking that we are continuous. We aren't.
</em><br>
<p>Then commented
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There is a difference -- see below:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exist in short, daily bursts. We lose consciousness each night -- more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; often if we happen to drink to excess or have surgical operations or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; receive traumatic blows to the head. There is no continuous me --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just the illusion of it maintained by my memories of what I did and felt
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; preceding day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Continuity is provided by association with the same body that you went to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sleep
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in. Given the ephemeral nature of intelligence, you have to place the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;burden
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continuity on the corpus. &lt;largish snip&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;it wouldn't be you -- it would be a copy of you; a separate person
</em><br>
<em>&gt;associated with a different corpus who just happens to be very similar to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the (now extinct) you. [Corpus in this case can just as easily refer to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;specific memory hardware that an uploaded self is running on -- don't get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;started on how to kill an uploaded intelligence through use of the mv
</em><br>
<em>&gt;command :)].
</em><br>
<p>Although I don't go back far on the list and haven't checked the archives, I 
<br>
know how this debate goes round and round in circles. I think, in the end, 
<br>
we're stuck with our deepest intuitions on this one, and I can't find a way 
<br>
to break the deadlock. However, I've come to the conclusion over the years 
<br>
that I am not prepared to jump substrate in the rapid way implied by most 
<br>
conceptions of destructive uploading.
<br>
<p>Miriam could probably find somewhere a copy of _The Year's Best Australian 
<br>
Science Fiction and Fantasy_ ed. Jonathan Strahan and Jeremy G. Byrne, which 
<br>
reprints my 1997 story &quot;Lucent Carbon&quot;. That story agonises over the 
<br>
question and takes it about as far as I can take it now, four years later 
<br>
(Miriam, I might even send you a copy of this in case you're interested). 
<br>
The only thing that has changed is that my intuitions have firmed up even 
<br>
more along the same lines as Reason's.
<br>
<p>There's an excellent article on this stuff by Monash University philosopher 
<br>
Aubrey Townsend in issue # 78 of the British sf-related academic journal 
<br>
_Foundation_. Townsend introduces some of the main literature and poses a 
<br>
test of our intuitions, developed from earlier examples due to Bernard 
<br>
Williams and others. I can't help adding that I guest-coedited this 
<br>
particular issue and that it also includes a long symposium with Gregory 
<br>
Benford, Joe Haldeman and others, which touches on some of these same 
<br>
questions. Haldeman, as I understand him, puts a position similar to 
<br>
Miriam's at one point.
<br>
<p>Ascend (one way or another)...
