Hal, thanks, I suspected that building standards for strength have been of
<br>
lower priority in favor of wind load or earthquake flexibility leading to
<br>
unsafe building design. 
<br>
<p>The weakling of buildings for open plan office design had not even crossed
<br>
my mind. 
<br>
<p>Look like the old I beam steel framed box design from the 1900's is still
<br>
the best for large buildings.
<br>
<p>I am not even sure if the Empire State building required insulation around
<br>
the I beams. Yet even with the hot aviation gas fed fire, the upper floors
<br>
were structurally sound after the accident.
<br>

<em>&gt;&gt; Interesting that the Empire State Building took a direct hit of an american
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; air force bomber with a much more explosive fuel (aviation gas) than jet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fuel and  damage was minimal. Makes you wonder about building standards and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; building permit enforcement today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;John Young, an architect, gave this explanation on another mailing list:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:The WTC towers had a distinctive structural system which utilized
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:the exterior wall framing for lateral bracing -- a so-called lattice
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:framework. This allowed minimization of internal lateral bracing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:and opened up the floor plans. You can see the effect of that when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:the buildings collapsed, with the lattice framework crumbling and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:the interior imploding. The lattice works so long as it remains
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:intact as a system: if a part of it goes, then the whole system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:goes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:The planes punched holes in the lattice, one tower punched
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:on two sides, maybe the other too. Portions of the lattice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:the second tower briefly remained standing after the collapse,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:then fell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:The system was considered daring at the time of construction, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:it distributed loads more efficiently than legacy column-and-beam-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:supported systems. Probably the legacy systems would not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:totally collapsed due to damage at upper floors, although floors
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:above the damage would have come down if columns were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:weakened.
</em><br>
