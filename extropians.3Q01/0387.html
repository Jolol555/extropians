<em>&gt; Hey folks, we've got one more socialist on the list!
</em><br>
<p>I suppose, although I hate to pigeonhole myself into
<br>
any category. I guess it comes partially from watching
<br>
my father spend more time with his projects at work
<br>
than at home (by necessity--he would have rather been
<br>
with us), then having his projects canned just before
<br>
completion. What was it all for, designing automation
<br>
machinery then having it all thrown out so the company
<br>
could purchase the same thing elsewhere for *more*
<br>
money?
<br>
<p>He worked for Chrysler. I can't look at the cars from
<br>
1975 to 1985 and see what it was all for. They took
<br>
his life in exchange for the smallest wage the UAW
<br>
would let them get away with, and gave his family
<br>
nothing but a small discount on a substandard,
<br>
overpriced vehicle with lousy (okay, antagonistic and
<br>
downright mean) customer service.  Transhumanists, I
<br>
ask you--what price for a huge section of the sweet
<br>
pie of one's life?
<br>
<p>I hope nobody on the list works for Daimler-Chrysler.
<br>
:) If I offend I apologize, but my distaste for them
<br>
and their stupid antics will never go away.
