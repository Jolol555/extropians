<em>&gt; &gt; But in the last chapter Kuhn tentatively attacked the view that science makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; progress toward objective truths: &quot;We may, to be more precise, have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relinquish the notion, explicit or implicit, that changes of paradigm carry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientists and those who learn from them closer and closer to the truth.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Kuhn's book lately seems to have become read (or at least quoted) as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; manifesto for a general attack on the presumed objectivity of science.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note Weinberg's correct observation that this is a tentative observation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reinforced by Kuhn's &quot;we may&quot;. It's anything but a strident or definite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion -- it's part of a section mulling over various ways to look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the implications of the contrasts Kuhn noted between science's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-description and its actual history. 
</em><br>
<p>Yet it is this 'tentative' observation which has won out in the public
<br>
scene as Kuhn' legacy. The damage he did with these subjectivist
<br>
statements is among the greatest propaganda losses to luddism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is anyone suggesting that we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never even consider the idea that scientific paradigm shifts form a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successive approximation to truth?
</em><br>
<p>Not I, but that is the position of the subjectivists and of the luddite
<br>
movement.
