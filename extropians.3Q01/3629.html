</em><br>
<p>Well...try this spin:
<br>
<p>If our research truly would be all that more effective and efficient
<br>
for being done in our own colony, then maybe the information would be
<br>
useless to them for countering us?  Say, nearing the ridiculous
<br>
extreme:
<br>
<p>We based our defenses on some newly discovered technology.  Their spies
<br>
easily and quickly learn of our advance and transmit it to their
<br>
superiors - or perhaps they merely listen in when we deliberately
<br>
broadcast it for anyone interested.  They analyse the tech in a day,
<br>
figure out a perfect countermeasure, and send up a party to take us
<br>
over a day after that...only to discover our nanoreplicators have
<br>
already upgraded the by now seriously obsolete technology.  All their
<br>
attack brings is some strange looks (&quot;You thought we were using *that*?
<br>
That was two days ago!  Get with the times, dudes!&quot;).
<br>
<p>The closer we get to the Singularity, the more viable such a defense
<br>
becomes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We should err on the side of having too much territory than too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little. Defining territorital space does not mean we will always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defend it, but it will definitely warn us of hostile attacks.
</em><br>
<p>But at the same time, we should be willing to assign the same space to
<br>
any other habitat...which puts a limit on how much territory we may
<br>
safely claim.  If we orbit opposite Earth, and claim a 1 AU radius
<br>
sphere...what if someone puts a colony 1/6th of an orbit ahead of us?
<br>
It's far enough away to be nonthreatening, yet clearly within our
<br>
space, to say nothing of us being in their space.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If they try to board...well, as advanced as even the US military is, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could gain an advantage with some research into weapons and gear for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dedicated space infantry (i.e., troops trained to fight only in a space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; station, not in jungles or cities or any environment inside a natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gravity well).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think they will want to board, because they can easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroy us with a volley of atomic bombs and dummies.
</em><br>
<p>Capturing the mad scientists so one can kill them, yet still study
<br>
their notes and exploit their research for the good of humanity, might
<br>
well be their goal.  Remember, once we create technology significantly
<br>
in advance of what anyone on Earth has, our colony itself could
<br>
potentially become a valuable prize.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I love the nation of my birth and hope its leaders will steer away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; from the course they seem to be taking in regards to biotech.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; wonder what else they may lose nerve about down the road! :(  When I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; go into space one day, I want to do so as a proud American citizen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my opinion, I think loyalty has little relevance. The colony ought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not to expect loyalty to itself per se, but in its way of life. That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means, colonists don't defend their colony's flag (if it even has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one), but their own ability to enjoy the life that the colony
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provides for them.
</em><br>
<p>Hopefully, this would make little difference.  In practice, though,
<br>
instilling that form of loyalty might well guard against corruption -
<br>
say, if some hostile power somehow managed to get a &quot;let's blow up the
<br>
colony and all head back to Earth to be sheep again&quot; type elected to
<br>
whatever government we have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This post brings back very fond memories of my time at the Extro! :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I was privy to some great conversations there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wonder about what event did you refer to. Sorry, pardon my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorance of the Extropian history.
