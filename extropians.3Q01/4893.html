You may want to check out the &quot;Heston Speech&quot; thread from late February.
<br>
Reading this oration again now hasn't softened my view of it, but we
<br>
pretty well beat up that subject back then. I guess maybe if you liked
<br>
Reagan, you'll love Heston. That makes perfect sense. Heston seems to
<br>
even at the moment still have intact mental faculties, although, to be
<br>
fair, Reagan did too, for the first couple of years maybe. Needless to
<br>
say, I didn't care for Reagan. Not as a president, at least(he was
<br>
decent in &quot;The Killers&quot;). Reagan sure was a guy that spent a lot of time
<br>
dwelling on the past. Apparently even had doubts about evolution, but,
<br>
come to think of it, Heston did narrate a film critical of evolutionary
<br>
theory. If that's the kind of president you really want to deal with the
<br>
innovations of the 21st century, then I guess Heston is your man. I
<br>
prefer my ideas a little fresher than anything Heston has to say.
<br>
