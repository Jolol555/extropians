<p><em>&gt; Insight is the elimination of the ignorance which is the

<em>&gt; very center of the self, the ignorance that self creates.
</em><br>
<p>An odd word to describe this; but all right, I understand that you
<br>
are describing the momentary feeling when one's understanding and
<br>
perceptions change.  Very well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Insight dispels that very center.  With the ignorance, perception is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not possible.  It's blindness in a way. What next? I am an ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human, with all my animal instincts, pleasure and pain and reward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and punishment and so on.  I hear you [Eugene] say this, and I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you are saying has some kind of reason, logic and order.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes sense as far as we can see... Then how am I to have reason in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my life?  How am I to bring it about?
</em><br>
<p>Who can say for sure?  But I'll put my amateurish two cents in.
<br>
Our instincts (definitely including our emotions) foment in most
<br>
of us commendable rational processes of finding what's so and 
<br>
what's not.  Sometimes, of course, the results of this inquiry
<br>
are not welcome.  One has uncomfortable feelings of dissonance,
<br>
incompleteness, and lack of harmony, and some people simply shut
<br>
the door on those feelings and thoughts at once.  We, generally
<br>
speaking, are not such people.  So what we can do is carefully
<br>
and repeatedly give internal voice to those unpleasant conclusions.
<br>
<p>In my own case, to take a recent example, I must say over and
<br>
over, &quot;The Fred Reed piece had some definite racist passages.&quot;
<br>
When I am comfortable saying that, I can then proceed to the
<br>
more difficult abridgment, &quot;The Fred Reed piece was racist.&quot;
<br>
Now after I say it a few times, it gets a lot easier.
<br>
<p>In just this way, we can employ our rationality to help ourselves
<br>
move forward.  In this way, we can allow, as you put it, reason
<br>
into our lives.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S. Standing challenge to any of you liberals out there:
<br>
top that!  Confess how you have articulated to yourself
<br>
something as explosive as &quot;Fred Reed's piece is racist&quot;
<br>
but with the shoe on the other foot, and how you, even
<br>
though it was exceedingly painful, had to give huge aid
<br>
and comfort to your ideological opponents.  (P.P.S.  I
<br>
don't think any of them will.)
