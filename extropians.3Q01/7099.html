</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regardless of whether your theory is correct or not, the result will be the

</em><br>
<p>I agree. I would hope that if such an attack had been engineered as
<br>
such, the people behind it could have achieved the same result with a
<br>
smaller scale attack. The choice of targets also seems to argue against
<br>
this possibility.
<br>
<p>Nonetheless, people and institutions will of course make use the attack
<br>
to further their agenda. I've done the same myself, trying to make the
<br>
point that americans might be more open to imprinting new memes at this
<br>
time, such as using a supposed heightened state of awareness to urge a
<br>
humanistic form of civil security, averting or at least delaying
<br>
ubiquitous law enforcement thru technological means.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nobody is going to stand up and say that this event has changed their minds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everybody is even more determined that their viewpoints are right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everybody assumes that this proves their point as everyone else should see.
</em><br>
<p>Yup. But some things have changed. It's a different world now. Perhaps
<br>
people cling to their pre-attack agendas partly as a defense mechanism,
<br>
but I think there is a opening for self-examination to take place. With
<br>
the passage of time rage will lessen. And I think there might be a high
<br>
level of guilt over any innocent people that are killed in the upcoming
<br>
retaliation and war. Maybe not at first, but eventually. TV and movie
<br>
violence is one thing, this is real, up close death and destruction in
<br>
your living room quite possibly every night for the next several months,
<br>
maybe years.
