&quot;What if&quot; scenarios have nothing to do with it. Consider each fact we
<br>
hold dear in terms of the sociological environment in place at the time
<br>
that fact came into being. Consider whatever political and religious
<br>
controversies. The point is, any arbitrary fact or piece of knowledge
<br>
could have been constructed at that time, and what was constructed met
<br>
the demand and dynamic nature of that environment. If constructed
<br>
knowledge proves useful, can be built upon, or in some other way
<br>
exhibits survivability, that knowledge remains. If not it goes away and
<br>
is superseded by something else. The knowledge we have exhibits the
<br>
exploratory and adaptive nature of mankind. We manufacture knowledge to
<br>
meet our needs and wants rather than discover it.
<br>
<p>The debate has its roots in the beginning of scientific exploration,
<br>
where it was believed natural objects exhibited behavior through will
<br>
and obedience to god and other mystical authoritarian forces. Authority
<br>
established knowledge. By challenging authority it was seen a string of
<br>
logical premises could be constructed to describe or explain the
<br>
behavior of natural objects.
<br>
<p>Realism represents a plateau in this development. Yes, cause and effect
<br>
are acknowledged rather than mysticism, but not how cause and effect are
<br>
no more than logical arguments to describe specific functionality.
<br>
Realism then, is an ideological reversion back to a time before science
<br>
even began. How much of realism implies concepts of origin, identity,
<br>
authority, or even god in some way or other. Countless times when I have
<br>
debated a realist, the debate finally comes to rest on the significance
<br>
of ontology alone, spirituality, or religion.
<br>
<p>I wish to make an assertion regarding the value of unqualified logic,
<br>
without regard to how it may affect existent realistic perspectives. I
<br>
wish to say logic is logic only, and has nothing to do with reality,
<br>
except to say reality is constructed on logical premises. Logic and the
<br>
ability to think must come before reality, else we are robotons and
<br>
bigots.
<br>
<p>Consider the new knowledge being formed today. How arbitrary it is.
<br>
Tomorrow many of these premises shall be the realism people debate with
<br>
then. But is it real today?

<em>&gt;The acceleration due to gravity on this planet existed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before there was any individual to believe in it...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and didn't change with changing beliefs as our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understanding evolved.  Even if we come to a radically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;new understanding of what gravity is, it won't change
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the fact that the acceleration due to gravity on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;planet is 9.8 m/s/s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's fun to play with &quot;what if&quot; scenarios where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reality isn't fixed... that it depends on viewpoint...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but that is all it is... play.  If you try to live
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your life like that you end up a Scientologist... or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Real knowledge is based on real facts... ones that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't depend on faith... that are always the same no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;matter who investigates them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Pseudo knowledge (much psychiatry, much sociology, all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religion) is based on beliefs.  Don't let the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adherents of those dubious bodies of &quot;knowledge&quot; fool
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you with terminology, they don't have facts but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beliefs.  And when you stop believing, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;knowledge&quot; does fall apart.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The ability to distinguish between reality based facts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and belief based &quot;facts&quot; is something that our current
</em><br>
<em>&gt;educational system fails to teach to most students.
