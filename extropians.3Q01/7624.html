<p>No. Harvey has so far shown that given the unloaded vehicle and vehicle +

We haven't started yet.

<p>I presume you're talking about the recently broken NSA's Dual Counter Mode
<br>
( <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-0109.html#2">http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-0109.html#2</a> ). It was not broken
<br>
by brute force but because it was a weak cipher. In fact due to it evident
<br>
weakness it raised speculations about NSAs motives and capabilities. If a
<br>
new cipher repeatedly resists cryptoanalytic attacks by the cryptographer
<br>
community that cipher is flagged as strong. Bruteforcing a strong
<br>
*current* cipher is impractical. So is cryptoanalysis, by definition. With
<br>
considerable effort old ciphers (e.g. DES but not triple-DES) can be
<br>
brute-forced.  Which is why I specifically set the expiration window to a
<br>
decade and specifically mentioned a *current* *strong* cipher.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Turns out, that by using java technology (similar to what SETI is doing) one

</em><br>

<p>SETI@home clients are not Java. Current production-quality JIT compilers
<br>
don't produce Java code which is suitable for numerics, such as crypto
<br>
brute-forcing. Distributed embarrassingly parallel computation is not
<br>
limited to a specific computer environment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; able to harness the computing power of millions of PC's for a few weeks, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did a brute-force crack of one of a PGP type code.
</em><br>
<p>PGP uses a number of ciphers. Particularly, GNUpg uses several classes of
<br>
symmetric ciphers, public-key ciphers, and one-way hashing functions.
<br>
Which of them do you mean, specifically? IDEA, CAST5, Blowfish, Twofish,
<br>
AES (Rijndael), 3DES? MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160, SHA2?
<br>
<p>I haven't heard of any &quot;hacker&quot; who has broken a strong modern cypher. If
<br>
you're taking about distributed.net, which project lists involves rc5, csc
<br>
and des efforts. These are not &quot;PGP type codes&quot;, with the exception of
<br>
MD5, which use is deprecated. These are all instances of obsolete/short
<br>
key ciphers which I've explicitely included into the brute-forceable list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First, &quot;they&quot; said that this computing power did not exist.  Technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, brute-forcing becomes more difficult as computers become faster,
<br>
due to the assymetry involved. Ciphers advance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then &quot;they&quot; said that no private citizen would be able to get a hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of such raw computing power.  Technology (or at least creativity)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced. Don't believe &quot;them&quot;.  Any code will eventually be cracked.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And it may not take as long as we think.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think Twofish will become crackable by brute-force (as defined by
<br>
several million machines, working for a year on a single key) in less than
<br>
10 years. I wouldn't bet my life on it, though, for that, there are
<br>
one-time pads.
