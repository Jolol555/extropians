I suspect this will not get linked into the discussion properly but
<br>
one must make an attempt...
<br>
<p>My comments &amp; links to the bills can be viewed at:

<p>Extropians should be very afraid -- you *are* having rights
<br>
denied/made illegal.

</em><br>
<p>This statement contains some assumptions that mis-represent
<br>
the problem.  You *are* already at war with bio-nanotech
<br>
entities who have no interest in your personal survival.
<br>
Your immune system is generally effective in defending
<br>
against such entities without the requirement for constant
<br>
intervention.  Further, you link nanotech and AI in a way
<br>
that suggests a threat that may be invalid.  You can have
<br>
nanotech and you can have AI but for either of them to be
<br>
overwhelmingly threatening their heat/surface area dissipation
<br>
has to have a very recognizable signature.  You have to make
<br>
a strong assertion that such organizations of matter can
<br>
hide themselves from detection or elimination.  If you cannot
<br>
make that case then it does not matter whether or not such
<br>
organizations of matter can be &quot;trusted&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; All it takes is one Blight to wipe us out. That kind of threat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not go away as humans progress to transhumanity, rather it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increases in likelihood. What is the stable state if not Sysop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or total death? There may be some other possibilities, can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you name some?
</em><br>
<p>Well, evolution in an upward spiral committed to extropian
<br>
principles seems like a stable state.   Note that this is
<br>
an unstable state for humanity as it likely concludes that
<br>
the instantiation of organized matter as &quot;humans&quot; is an
<br>
inefficient use of the locally available resources and must
<br>
be concluded.  
<br>
<p>So, the question would be, can one (as an extropian)
<br>
provide a coherent defense of the use of the material
<br>
and energy required for you to remain &quot;intact&quot; in the
<br>
light of more efficient reallocation of the resources
<br>
you are consuming?
<br>
<p>This is the moral problem -- Are you committed to the evolution
<br>
of matter to its highest extropic state or are you committed
<br>
to the preservation of oneself in a form that seems comfortable
<br>
to you?
<br>
<p>Do the needs of the many (the potential application of the atoms
<br>
at our disposal) outweigh the needs of the one (your personal survival)?
<br>
