<em>&gt; &gt; Two points:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1)  Your example is anecdotal.  There have been an unusually large number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; major earthquakes in the last ten years as well, but I'm not going to claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that it means anything significant at this stage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it's anecdotal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2)  Global warming should make things *colder* at your latitude, not warmer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (more extreme latitude gradient with respect to temperature).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uh-huh. You're maybe thinking about the postulated shutdown of the north
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Atlantic conveyor current, perhaps?
</em><br>
<p>Among others, despite the fact that it seems that almost all of the
<br>
warming is at polar latitudes, and I don't see any Siberians complaining
<br>
that the average temps there rose from -40 to a balmy -38 degrees....
<br>
Note the relative latitude of Britain vs the US. This summer has been
<br>
the coldest in many decades in my area. Should I therefore deduce an ice
<br>
age? No, I shouldn't. All of the warming has been during the past 22
<br>
years, which was one side of the solar magnetic cycle. With the flipping
<br>
of the solar mangetic field this winter, we are going to be entering a
<br>
22 year cooling period. Expect predictions of 'global warming' to
<br>
dissipate accordingly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Also, the best models and most current studies I've seen to date seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strongly suggest that a little global warming leads to a massive cold snap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (i.e. &quot;ice age&quot;), not a melting of the ice caps, so &quot;global warming&quot; would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; therefore seem to give most people the wrong idea of the actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consequences.  It won't be Cabo San Lucas in Minnesota, quite the opposite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in fact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I vaguely recall reports that most of the debunking research papers published
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on global warming are funded by the oil industry. However, it's not my field
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so I'll shut up for now (until I have time to read up on it in detail). Point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of note: global warming appears to be a much more accepted theory/hypothesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside the USA. You might want to consider the political implications ...
</em><br>
<p>Yes, please do, including the political fact that any proposed global
<br>
warming solution would require the flow of trillions of dollars into the
<br>
coffers of those countries crying the loudest about global warming,
<br>
irrespective of wheter or not warming does in fact exist. They know a
<br>
good thing when they see it.
