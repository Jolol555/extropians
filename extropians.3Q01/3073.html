<p><a href="http://www.extropy.org/extprn3.htm">http://www.extropy.org/extprn3.htm</a> - the bit about practical optimism,
<br>
especially.  (Not to use it as &quot;holy writ&quot;, but more as inspiration.)
<br>
<p>A good (IMO) case can be made that passively waiting for technology to
<br>
develop will make the odds quite high that the technology will either:
<br>
* not develop
<br>
* develop in some bad (for us) way
<br>
* develop far too late for it to do us much good (anti-aging doesn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;help if you're a 200-year-old dust pile, space access and colony
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;building doesn't help if the Luddites have already taken up arms and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;shot you and all your friends, et cetera)
<br>
<p>Isolate yourself in a small micronation, and you give up the resources
<br>
which allow you to conduct research - even if said research is
<br>
constrained by popular opinion.  This is probably much more of a
<br>
problem than you realize, so I invite you to consider, say, Somalia
<br>
conducting advanced research.  Granted, the average education level
<br>
would be higher, but the resources available are comparable - and
<br>
destitute poverty would probably be almost as rampant, without a
<br>
pre-existing industrial base.  (If something is easy to design but hard
<br>
to finance, it's still hard to actually create.)  Frankly, as far as
<br>
one's continued ability to affect the world goes, that's only a few
<br>
steps above going into cryo.
<br>
<p>You also, ironically, give the Luddites that much more of a target:
<br>
weapons of mass destruction are more easily employed when everyone who
<br>
would be affected is extremely unpopular with the deployers.  (Saddam,
<br>
for instance, had no problem deploying biological weapons vs. the
<br>
&quot;Satanic Westerners&quot;...assuming he had said weapons, which seems
<br>
likely.)
<br>
<p>Finally, where on Earth could you found a colony?  Even Antarctica is
<br>
&quot;claimed&quot; (in that no nation may impose its sovereignity on any part of
<br>
the continent).  There are some small islands, but none nearly large
<br>
enough for what you seek.  (The &quot;Mars colony&quot;, for instance, is
<br>
technically within the jurisdiction of Canada, I believe, which has no
<br>
problem with it since the colony's only trying to be technically
<br>
isolated.  For instance, a murder - in the unlikely event that the crew
<br>
got that stressed out - would be handled as any other homicide once the
<br>
LEAs got there.)
