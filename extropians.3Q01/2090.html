<em>&gt;This article has the same stuff you always hear: eat right (vegetarian),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't smoke and exercise. Also suggests that some sort of spiritual support
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system is beneficial as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As a former pentecostal Christian I can 'testify' to the beneficial euphoric
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feeling of listening to a great choir, surrounded by a supportive family of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fellow believers all of whom professed a love for my God and me and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feeling that no matter how bad I was yesterday, God still loved me and would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forgive me if I 'repented.' A clean slate is a very handy thing to have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It was also incredibly satisfying to believe that, in worshipping God, I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doing the most important work in the world.
</em><br>
<p>Never had it, can't say I miss it.
<br>
<p>Perhaps something along the model of the North Texas Church of Freethought 
<br>
would be the way to go.  They have the social mixing without the God stuff 
<br>
(they're all atheist/agnostic).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But, now that I'm an atheist, much of that sort of positive energy is gone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from my life. I can't believe the fairy tales anymore. But I would like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have some sort of spirituality in my life that didn't depend upon believing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a lie.
</em><br>
<p>Not sure what you mean by &quot;positive energy&quot;.  I enjoy life much better 
<br>
since my deconversion.  I've no idea what you could fill this void with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Since giving up on theism, I've tended toward Zen buddhist thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and practice and a sort of reverence for truth and quality ala _Zen and The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Art of Motorcyle Maintenance_.
</em><br>
<p>Didn't like that book.  Never read it, but when I picked it up off the 
<br>
bookstore shelf a while back I was actually looking for instructions for 
<br>
servicing my mopeds' carburettor.  Boy, was I surprised.  Still haven't 
<br>
found out a thing about my carb....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  This has been fairly satisfying of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spiritual yen, but not to the same extent as being in the house of worship
</em><br>
<em>&gt;used to provide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Any others on this list have a spiritual yearning? I'd be interested to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hear your thoughts, comments on how you satisfy it sans theism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- -Zero
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Life is good. Refuse to die.
</em><br>
<p>I have to say I really don't miss it, probably because even as a theist it 
<br>
was never a big thing for me.  The whole energetic choir/passionate and 
<br>
animated preacher thing would be considered a bit embarassing here 
<br>
also.  The most I've heard of is live music to try draw the crowds 
<br>
back.  Worked a little for a while I think.
<br>
<p>I'm attempting to start a Transhuman group here in Ireland.  I guess such 
<br>
social constructs might serve some of your missing positive energy.
<br>
<p><p>James...
<br>
<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
