Mark said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The classical liberal ideal usually is expressed as two parts, (1) the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the state ought to remain morally neutral in matters of morality (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the pursuit of our own individual conception of human flourishing) and (2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so long as the individual does not, in Mill's words, &quot;make himself a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nuisance to other people&quot; and &quot;short of injury to others&quot;. (Chapter 3 On
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Liberty).
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes it is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I know you are aware of this,
</em><br>
<p>And yes I am &lt;g&gt;.
<br>
<p><p><p><em> &gt;but I wonder if Kass makes any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arguments that invoke the second clause. Kass aside, do you see the coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;debate focused on 1 or 2? (If I were against transhumanism I think I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work on 2, after all, many of us are all too cognizant of the potential for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unintended consequence of technologies, for example, black goo and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unfriendly AI etc.)
</em><br>
<p>Okay. In fact, Kass does not accept that (1) should apply anymore in the 
<br>
area of reproductive technology/biotechnology. I don't think he ever invokes 
<br>
(2) and he does not believe he should have to.
<br>
<p>Here's what he says (among other things) about a liberal or libertarian 
<br>
approach to human cloning:
<br>
<p>&quot;...considering reproduction (and the intimate relations of family life!) 
<br>
primarily under the political-legal, adversarial, and individualistic notion 
<br>
of rights can only undermine the private yet fundamentally social, 
<br>
cooperative, and duty-laden character of child-bearing, child-rearing, and 
<br>
their bond to the covenant of marriage.&quot;
<br>
<p>The thrust of his arguments in the works I've read is not that cloning etc 
<br>
will cause a nuisance to other people or actual harm to other people. It is 
<br>
that (1) no longer applies to the &quot;post-human&quot; technologies that he refers 
<br>
to (ie the pill, IVF, etc, etc), and it is time for the state to take a 
<br>
moral stand. The nearest he comes is that the society that will be created 
<br>
will be an evil one, but not evil in the sense of the sort of harm or 
<br>
nuisance that you have in mind (or that Mill had in mind).
<br>
<p>As for (2), I for one am always open to argument that something should be 
<br>
prohibited or restricted in some way for *those* reasons. Despite my 
<br>
pro-tech bias, I can see that there might be situations arousing 
<br>
considerable but legitimate differences of opinion even among 
<br>
transhumanists.
<br>
<p>However, thinkers such as Leon Kass, Margaret Somerville, Brian Appleyard 
<br>
and many others less well known are quite happy to tear up the classical 
<br>
liberal ideal entirely, at least in the area of bioethics. I have no doubt 
<br>
that there'll be a similar batch of social conservative thinkers, and more 
<br>
than a few left-wing thinkers, who'll take a similar attitude to powerful 
<br>
developments in information technologies. The ill-fated Communications 
<br>
Decency Act gave us only the mildest foretaste of the moral panics to come.
<br>
<p>So, to sum up, even Kass aside, there's going to be a helluva fight 
<br>
protecting (1) above.
<br>
<p>Again, we have to take the cultural offensive (to borrow a phrase from 
<br>
Natasha), though - yet again - we must do so in a sweet and reasonable 
<br>
style. I continue to think that we should go out of our way not to alienate 
<br>
the public by insensitivity, given how much our ideas will themselves have a 
<br>
huge alienation potential. What this means for individuals and how they 
<br>
present themselves, I'll leave to individuals, though I'm sure many of us 
<br>
would appreciate the sharing of suggestions.
<br>
<p>Cheers
<br>
Russell
