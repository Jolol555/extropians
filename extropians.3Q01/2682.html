<p>I remember a DOS program, back in the '80s, by the name of &quot;PCROBOTS&quot;
<br>
that did more or less that.  It took simple C source files, with a few
<br>
custom routines to drive sensors and cannons and motors, and loaded
<br>
them into virtual robots and ran them against each other.  It wasn't
<br>
the only one of its kind by any means, but it's the one I remember most
<br>
since coding a good 'bot for that was one of my first non-trivial C
<br>
programs.  I would not be surprised to find it still exists today,
<br>
though there are probably more complex (more realistic) simulations out
<br>
there.
<br>
<p>One thing keeping this particular example from BattleBots or similar
<br>
competitions: the only good weapon was a cannon, and BattleBots
<br>
specifically prohibits untethered projectiles.
