<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I consciously adopt the language of my audience. At the end of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recent post, I mentioned God even though I'm an agnostic. Was the rest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the content valuable, or rendered valueless?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The latter. To cite a recent case, a superficially reasonable email on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; post-WTC policy sailed into my inbox a few days ago. It made sense right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; unto the final sentence, which read &quot;God bless America&quot;. Now, I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; trust people basically driven by inscrutable motivations. One might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; support points of policy, warily so, but certainly not the person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pushing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; it. Sooner or later, the dissonance must surface.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What is the big deal here?  Saying &quot;God bless America&quot; speaks quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the 90% of Americans according to polls who have some level of theistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; belief.  To ask for God's blessing on America in the face of 9/11 and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; level of belief is almost mandatory if you want to reach the people and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to their hearts.  Why should those who are not theistic make such a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, then, what about the remaining 10% - are we chopped liver?  When a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President speaks to all the &quot;American people,&quot; how does it compromise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything he may need to say if he simply talks about the business at hand?
</em><br>
<p>Presidents speak to majorities quite often.  I do understand your point I
<br>
just think it is not terribly relevant at this time.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; (In fact, he compromises what he has to say every time he mentions God,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because that's coo-coo and childish, e.g., just like having an &quot;Invisible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friend,&quot; you know, except for grownups.)  Certainly it's the President's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to mention God, just as it is his right to mention that he believes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the earth is flat (althouth even if he and 90% of Americans believed THAT,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would still not make it true).  But, and this is the most important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue, he would still be excluding 90% of his audience.  Neutrality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding the God issue is a better idea, IMHO - we are supposed to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secular government, after all.  However, it may be more appropriate for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President to talk about &quot;God&quot; to a captive audience of churchgoers, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance (although it would still be coo-coo).
</em><br>
<p>In these circumstances such neutrality would not speak to what moves
<br>
90% of the people and would fee very strange to them.  We are a secular
<br>
government.  That does not mean that relgious concepts never get mentioned.
<br>
<p>I really have what I believe are more pressing things to talk about right
<br>
now.
<br>
<p>Lashing out becauce the G word was used at a time like this is imho tremendously
<br>
counterproductive.  As a friend of mine would say &quot;Very true but irrelevant at 
<br>
this time.&quot;
