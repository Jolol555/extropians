<em>&gt; &gt;   If you think public education is all that... wait 20 years and look

<em>&gt; &gt; Vs. the criminal farms we have now.

<em>&gt;It's a continual wonder to me that I, my children, friends, acquaintances

<em>&gt;and relatives all seem to have come out of these criminal farms unscathed,

<em>&gt;educated and ... have even lived to tell about it.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe the private schools teach some people to be snobbish about schools 
<br>
and to have little empathy for those less well off than themselves. :-) Of 
<br>
course I know there are plenty of people who go to private school who *are* 
<br>
tolerant; but maybe the petty intolerance of some of those speaking here in 
<br>
favor of dismantling public school might be at least partially explained 
<br>
that way. :-) (Just so there is no mistake, I am mostly kidding when I say 
<br>
that.)
<br>
<p>Like Olga, I also went to a public school. I seem to have turned out OK. I 
<br>
and one of my best friends (also in public school) were chosen as some of 
<br>
the smartest 50 kids in NSW. (Frankly I think they made a bit of a mistake 
<br>
with me. There were others I'm sure were considerably smarter than me.)
<br>
<p>Some of our teachers were wonderful people, often staying back long after 
<br>
after school hours helping kids.
<br>
<p>My father went to a private school and after his terrible experience with 
<br>
the bullying and overly strict discipline he swore that no kids of his 
<br>
would ever go to private school.
<br>
<p>One of the things I value most about my time at school is the wide 
<br>
cross-section of kids I befriended. One quite wonderful kid was retarded, 
<br>
another of my best friends was very smart but had a nervous breakdown each 
<br>
time exams came around. My very closest friend was devoutly religious but 
<br>
had one of the best, most agile minds I have ever come across. We spent 
<br>
many happy hours discussing topology, electronic logic circuits, nuclear 
<br>
physics, theories of matter, etc. This was back in the 60s. Very happy 
<br>
times for me.
<br>
<p>Breeding grounds for criminals Brian??? I don't think so.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
