<em>&gt;&gt; A couple food stamps and a bottle of ripple.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This latter bit is pretty typical of the racist comments that appear so
</em><br>
often on this list.  Does this kind of statement really lend anything to the
<br>
discussion other than advertise and promote the prejudices of the writer?
<br>
<p>Here's a good example of the mis-use of the word Racism and why it gets
<br>
thrown around at everything possible.
<br>
<p>Racism is:
<br>
a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities
<br>
and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular
<br>
race
<br>
<p>Discrimination on the other hand is:
<br>
The act of discriminating, distinguishing, or noting and marking
<br>
differences.
<br>
<p>Is it racist to say that blacks drink ripple? No. (this doesn't say anything
<br>
about any race being inherently superior) Is it discriminatory? Yes.
<br>
<p>But we also discriminate over a multitude of things during the day. We
<br>
discriminate if doctors are licensed, people we hire have the correct
<br>
qualifications, and even over which soft drink we drink.
<br>
<p>Do people have an inherent right to not be offended at others thoughts... I
<br>
don't think so, or at least I wouldn't want to see the thought police funded
<br>
with my tax dollars. As a business owner, I should have the right to control
<br>
my property and only hire blonde haired, green eyed, women with a 38 bust
<br>
and a limp and exclude all others. Its my property after all right? The
<br>
alternative is that all people must be excepted for all jobs, or else they
<br>
were discriminated because of some reason...
<br>
<p>Psss, here where the moderates should jump in and start praising the value
<br>
of the fuzzy gray void between statements of principle. Ill be sure next
<br>
time im robbed to just give the robber half my goodies as a nice compromise
<br>
between his values and mine.
