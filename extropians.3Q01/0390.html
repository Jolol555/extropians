The Abolition of Work
<br>
<a href="http://www.zpub.com/notes/black-work.html">http://www.zpub.com/notes/black-work.html</a>
<br>
No one should ever work.
<br>
<p>Work is the source of nearly all the misery in the world. Almost any evil
<br>
you'd care to name comes from working or from living in a world designed for
<br>
work. In order to stop suffering, we have to stop working.
<br>
<p>That doesn't mean we have to stop doing things. It does mean creating a new
<br>
way of life based on play; in other words, a ludic conviviality, commensality,
<br>
and maybe even art. There is more to play than child's play, as worthy as that
<br>
is. I call for a collective adventure in generalized joy and freely
<br>
interdependent exuberance. Play isn't passive. Doubtless we all need a lot
<br>
more time for sheer sloth and slack than we ever enjoy now, regardless of
<br>
income or occupation, but once recovered from employment-induced exhaustion
<br>
nearly all of us want to act. Oblomovism and Stakhanovism are two sides of the
<br>
same debased coin.
<br>
<p>The ludic life is totally incompatible with existing reality. So much the
<br>
worse for &quot;reality,&quot; the gravity hole that sucks the vitality from the little
<br>
in life that still distinguishes it from mere survival. Curiously -- or maybe
<br>
not -- all the old ideologies are conservative because they believe in work.
<br>
Some of them, like Marxism and most brands of anarchism, believe in work all
<br>
the more fiercely because they believe in so little else.
<br>
<p>Liberals say we should end employment discrimination. I say we should end
<br>
employment. Conservatives support right-to-work laws. Following Karl Marx's
<br>
wayward son-in-law Paul Lafargue I support the right to be lazy. Leftists
<br>
favor full employment. Like the surrealists -- except that I'm not kidding --
<br>
I favor full unemployment. Trotskyists agitate for permanent revolution. I
<br>
agitate for permanent revelry. But if all the ideologues (as they do) advocate
<br>
work -- and not only because they plan to make other people do theirs -- they
<br>
are strangely reluctant to say so. They will carry on endlessly about wages,
<br>
hours, working conditions, exploitation, productivity, profitability. They'll
<br>
gladly talk about anything but work itself. These experts who offer to do our
<br>
thinking for us rarely share their conclusions about work, for all its
<br>
saliency in the lives of all of us. Among themselves they quibble over the
<br>
details. Unions and management agree that we ought to sell the time of our
<br>
lives in exchange for survival, although they haggle over the price. Marxists
<br>
think we should be bossed by bureaucrats. Libertarians think we should be
<br>
bossed by businessmen. Feminists don't care which form bossing takes so long
<br>
as the bosses are women. Clearly these ideology-mongers have serious
<br>
differences over how to divvy up the spoils of power. Just as clearly, none of
<br>
them have any objection to power as such and all of them want to keep us
<br>
working.
<br>
<p>You may be wondering if I'm joking or serious. I'm joking and serious. To be
<br>
ludic is not to be ludicrous. Play doesn't have to be frivolous, although
<br>
frivolity isn't triviality: very often we ought to take frivolity seriously.
<br>
I'd like life to be a game -- but a game with high stakes. I want to play for
<br>
keeps.
<br>
<p>The alternative to work isn't just idleness. To be ludic is not to be
<br>
quaaludic. As much as I treasure the pleasure of torpor, it's never more
<br>
rewarding than when it punctuates other pleasures and pastimes. Nor am I
<br>
promoting the managed time-disciplined safety-valve called &quot;leisure&quot;; far from
<br>
it. Leisure is nonwork for the sake of work. Leisure is the time spent
<br>
recovering from work and in the frenzied but hopeless attempt to forget about
<br>
work. Many people return from vacation so beat that they look forward to
<br>
returning to work so they can rest up. The main difference between work and
<br>
leisure is that work at least you get paid for your alienation and enervation.
<br>
<p>I am not playing definitional games with anybody. When I say I want to abolish
<br>
work, I mean just what I say, but I want to say what I mean by defining my
<br>
terms in non-idiosyncratic ways. My minimum definition of work is forced
<br>
labor, that is, compulsory production. Both elements are essential. Work is
<br>
production enforced by economic or political means, by the carrot or the
<br>
stick. (The carrot is just the stick by other means.) But not all creation is
<br>
work. Work is never done for its own sake, it's done on account of some
<br>
product or output that the worker (or, more often, somebody else) gets out of
<br>
it. This is what work necessarily is. To define it is to despise it. But work
<br>
is usually even worse than its definition decrees. The dynamic of domination
<br>
intrinsic to work tends over time toward elaboration. In advanced work-riddled
<br>
societies, including all industrial societies whether capitalist of
<br>
&quot;Communist,&quot; work invariably acquires other attributes which accentuate its
<br>
obnoxiousness.
