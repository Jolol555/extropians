From: &quot;Russell Blackford&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:RussellBlackford@bigpond.com?Subject=Re:%20Political%20Compass&In-Reply-To=&lt;008301c12f22$e60ba180$805d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">RussellBlackford@bigpond.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; My probem is that the word &quot;liberal&quot; gets used as an insult or a put-down,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as in &quot;liberal schmalz&quot; (which was what I reacted to), especially when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are arguing with Olga or Miriam. I guess Olga and Miriam can look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after themselves, but there is this tendency on the list to suggest that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people like them are wrong *because* of their liberal qualities. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes seems to be a background assumption that social demcratic ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ipso facto lack legitimacy.
</em><br>
<p>Well, maybe social democratic ideas lack legitimacy because they're presented
<br>
as social democratic ideas instead of as just plain good ideas that don't need
<br>
to be validated by political association. Personally, I have no political or
<br>
religious preferences at all (no really, it even says so on my dog tags and my
<br>
cv ©¿©¬ ).
<br>
<p>When I took the comprehensive political questionnaire that determines
<br>
political ideology coordinates, and compares that to British politicians
<br>
<a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org/">http://www.politicalcompass.org/</a>
<br>
(OK, it's just another bogus test, but) I liked my result: Dead center between
<br>
left and right, and two points closer to libertarian than authoritarian. For
<br>
all I know, that's what they show for everyone who takes the test.
<br>
<p>So, how did you score?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This *may* be because some of the leaders of the extropian movement have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong libertarian views, but I don't see any necessary connection when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read the extropian principles.
</em><br>
<p>I'll go along peaceably with that delineation, and only add that extropian
<br>
principles, IMNSHO, ought to promote extropy, viz., the self-organization
<br>
which opposes entropy. Any political (or even general) views that get in the
<br>
way of extropy should be by-passed, superseded, defeated, debunked, abandoned,
<br>
dismissed, or (my favorite) identified as useless.
<br>

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego
