<em>&gt; If you know where the emotions come from, you can replace them with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract thought structures that implement the same functionality.
</em><br>
<p>That's a big &quot;if&quot; because if the emotions come from sensory input mixed with
<br>
memory and intuition, abstract thought structures alone will not suffice to
<br>
implement the same functionality. To phrase it differently, if the &quot;gut feel&quot;
<br>
is derived from enteric nervous system interaction with the CNS, which is
<br>
stimulated by external signals, which in turn generates further cerebral
<br>
activity, then moral decisions may require physical or sensory connection to
<br>
the corporeal environment. In contrast, abstract thought structures operate in
<br>
isolation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Otherwise, of course, you'd better pay attention.  In fact, you'd better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pay attention regardless, because a lot of things that look irrational at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first glance turn out to be adaptive for good reasons.  (However, it does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually make sense to override emotions that appear to be adaptive for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very clear evolutionary reasons that conflict with your own declared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals.)
</em><br>
<p>Overriding emotions can be dangerous not only for the reasons you mention, but
<br>
also because the methodology involved in the override process can become
<br>
associated with pathological behavior. For example, repression of emotion for
<br>
the sake of misguided religious ideals can pervert healthy expression of
<br>
honest feelings. More drastic instances of dysfunction resulting from
<br>
overriding emotions have been mentioned by Richard Dawkins in his article
<br>
&quot;Religion's Misguided Missiles.&quot;
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
