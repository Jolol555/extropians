<p>*********************************************************
<br>
<p>The sudden outbreak of unconventional warfare 
<br>
has not escaped Viridian attention.  In this Note,
<br>
I would like to make it clear how the Pope-Emperor
<br>
plans to adapt the Viridian Movement to our altered 
<br>
social circumstances.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have likely already seen a lot of earnest
<br>
commentary consigning the period 1989-2001 to history.  
<br>
We are suddenly in a turbulent and violent time, and in a 
<br>
burst of harsh martial virtue, our immediate past is being 
<br>
written off as squalid, and overindulged, and pampered, 
<br>
and fatally innocent, and possibly somewhat effeminate. 
<br>
This is exactly what happened the last time a Belle Epoque 
<br>
collapsed.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of the last Belle Epoque -- through terrorism
<br>
in glamorous Serbia, unfortunately -- was followed by the 
<br>
gruesome mobilizations of August 1914, the War to End War.  
<br>
There's still terrorism in the Balkans nowadays, one might 
<br>
note. The War to End Terrorism at least has a different 
<br>
slogan, though.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This event might be a passing nasty shock,  like Aum 
<br>
Shinri Kyo or Jonestown.  More severely, it might rival or 
<br>
surpass the Gulf War of 1991. The last such war was also a 
<br>
very sweaty-palmed event, but it was followed by a 
<br>
considerable boom.  Wars do end, and if this one ends 
<br>
quickly and well, we might well find ourselves with a New 
<br>
World Order that's more than just talk, and a Long Boom 
<br>
with some serious muscle behind it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, it may be that Viridian Green, founded in 1998, is 
<br>
past its sell-by date.  We may be well on our way to that 
<br>
much-forecasted next stage, Khaki Green, where pop culture 
<br>
and commercialism lose all their charms and the heavy 
<br>
lifting gets done by those long-time Viridian idols, cops 
<br>
and the military.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me speak up now in firm defense  of that Belle 
<br>
Epoque.  That ten-year-period was truly grand.   We were 
<br>
historically lucky to live through it.  It began 
<br>
beautifully and it perished, if anything, through too much 
<br>
hope. It was not naive and foolishly innocent, it was 
<br>
splendid, vital and profoundly creative. Those were the 
<br>
best years of the 20th century, when at least some of its 
<br>
beleagured inhabitants finally found a proper way to live, 
<br>
a decent way that offered many great virtues.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nutty bubble economies run by cheery visionaries are 
<br>
much better for us than crass economies run by stolid 
<br>
monopolist bores.  Near-total employment is far better 
<br>
than severe unemployment.  R&amp;D from peace dividends is 
<br>
better than a pinched war economy.  Booming tourism from 
<br>
happy foreigners is better than empty hotels and airports.  
<br>
Politicians bedevilled with colorful sex scandals are 
<br>
better than fierce and resolute war leaders.  And shucking 
<br>
and jiving our way out of an ecological crisis by making 
<br>
green design trendy was a much better method of 
<br>
controlling CO2 emissions than empty skies, market panics, 
<br>
and military hairshirts.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was not a dumb, innocent epoch.  *This* is a 
<br>
dour and bitter epoch.  We Viridians may have to wear some 
<br>
hairshirt, we may not be given any choice there, but 
<br>
ladies and gentlemen, we Viridians don't *do* hairshirt.  
<br>
We're not going to pretend that hairshirt is better.  
<br>
Belle Epoque is vastly better.  This is worse.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Viridian want more  Belle Epoque.  We will scheme 
<br>
tirelessly to get it back, revive it,  or fetch another 
<br>
one.  We do hope to live long enough to see one.  If we 
<br>
can't be its promoters, then we'll be its monks: we will 
<br>
protect its relics and its memory, we will copy it, we 
<br>
will distribute it, we will keep its lamps burning.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, the cultural circumstances are rapidly and 
<br>
visibly changing, and our favorite tactics  will clearly 
<br>
be less effective for a while, not that they ever worked 
<br>
all that well. They were not, in fact, the most effective 
<br>
tactics possible.  Making things cool, making ideas 
<br>
trendy, were simply the tactics that we Viridians happened 
<br>
to be particularly good at.  They were things we enjoyed 
<br>
doing.  They were an efficient use of our limited talents 
<br>
and resources.  They were the sorts of things that a few 
<br>
hundred people can do on the Internet without having to 
<br>
incorporate or buy uniforms.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most effective tactics for forcing huge numbers of 
<br>
people to undergo sudden and radical social change are 
<br>
done with bayonets.  They're evil tactics, and 
<br>
regrettable, and morally repulsive, but just look at what 
<br>
has happened in two weeks.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may notice that although coverage of the 
<br>
Greenhouse Effect has vanished during the crisis, utterly 
<br>
involuntary yet very powerful anti-Greenhouse measures 
<br>
have taken place, to an extent previously unimaginable.  
<br>
The sky was empty of aircraft == those great guzzlers of 
<br>
fossil fuel. Americans, incredibly, are taking trains.  No 
<br>
one is buying big cars.  Even the ads so loathed by 
<br>
ADBUSTERS were busted off of the television.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short order, the USA is very likely to have both 
<br>
Arctic drilling *and* stiff conservation measures, 
<br>
renewables *and* maybe even nuclear, along with the kind 
<br>
of across the board belt-tightening that Greens never
<br>
succeed in promulgating == measures that only rage and 
<br>
terror make worthwhile. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, when the Kyoto carousel rolls around 
<br>
again, the USA will not be balking on the sidelines, the 
<br>
planet's lone prima donna, pretending that free enterprise 
<br>
is more important than global security.  Then there's that 
<br>
nuclear nonproliferation treaty that the US Senate didn't 
<br>
care about; that biological warfare thing that was too 
<br>
complex and invasive to enforce; those numerous human 
<br>
rights accords, dozens, that the USA  considered too 
<br>
restrictive and obnoxious; those UN dues the USA 
<br>
deliberately refused to pay; the endless fight-picking 
<br>
with Iran, Cuba and China; well, you can name your own.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, we Viridians are not the people to 
<br>
take any kind of effective lead here.  We are design 
<br>
advocates, we're not spies, diplomats, cops or firemen, 
<br>
and we are certainly not going to be so fatuous  as to 
<br>
become armchair soldiers.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're a dot.org, not a dot.mil.  Furthermore, we 
<br>
Viridians are not even patriotic. Our core concern has 
<br>
nothing to do with nationalities; it's by its very nature 
<br>
global. A hard Greenhouse rain falls on the stockbroker 
<br>
and the mujihadeen alike.  We Viridians are one of those 
<br>
slithering, highly dispersed, mobile, multinational, 
<br>
network entities you've been hearing about.  Our natural 
<br>
environment, the place for which we were created, is the 
<br>
Internet.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Viridians can't and don't exist without the 
<br>
network, but now, we should expect the Net to change. It 
<br>
does that, you know: from military labs, to big science, 
<br>
academia, the dotcom period, it's very ductile.  I have 
<br>
never seen such an outburst of black propaganda and psyops 
<br>
on the Net as I have seen in these two weeks. It is a 
<br>
kulturkampf battleground.  I expect some Cold War-style 
<br>
heavy manners in a realm that is this troubled with 
<br>
imaginary Qaeda email, huge Microsoft worms, brand-new 
<br>
ECHELON-style terrie-trackers from brand-new agencies, 
<br>
self-appointed hacker vigilantes, and whole swarms of 
<br>
nutcase script-kids.  Any serious new hacker-crackdown 
<br>
will pick up those little malefactors by the basketfull.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Net looks bad.  The status quo ante is not going 
<br>
to cut it. Unless I miss my guess, the Net will be moving 
<br>
away from the flaky amateurism and sordid tragedy-of-the-
<br>
commons that was its pride and joy, right past that 
<br>
totally imaginary commercial nirvana, and straight into a 
<br>
paramilitarized, ARPANET-friendly, Nervous System of the 
<br>
Coalition phase.  We Viridians may be rather squeezed for 
<br>
room  and oxygen in there.  We may find ourselves asking 
<br>
for your help, in backups, archiving, distribution, web 
<br>
service and so forth.  Feel free to volunteer.  People of 
<br>
good will need to be uniting to move this medium into a 
<br>
disciplined, serious role as the backbone of a troubled 
<br>
global civil society. If that effort fails, the Net is 
<br>
going to go the way of CB radio.  Or worse.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Viridians may have a harder time of it. Money, 
<br>
toys, and time may get tighter.  We Viridians will no 
<br>
longer look much like What Happens Next (because we're 
<br>
not), and our abiding interests are likely to look a bit 
<br>
flaky and antiquarian for a while, like some guy leafing 
<br>
through  Beardsley's YELLOW BOOK as the zeppelins hum 
<br>
above the searchlights.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However: our core issue, the Greenhouse Effect, is 
<br>
not going to forsake us.  On the contrary: the USA is 
<br>
about to undergo a military-entertainment dust-up with one 
<br>
of the poorest and most stricken countries on Earth, a 
<br>
place of incessant gunfire, poxed with landmines, that 
<br>
hasn't had a decent rain in 3 solid years.  People who can 
<br>
live on naan bread and goat cheese are starving there from 
<br>
bad weather.  Is it an accident that a place like that 
<br>
hides people of the Al Qaeda ilk?  They're the New World 
<br>
Disorder, and they've learned how to ship.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the economic impact from the sudden loss of 
<br>
two skyscrapers in New York City. It's colossal.  That's 
<br>
straight from the file we Viridians like to label &quot;world 
<br>
becoming uninsurable.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now  try to imagine New York hit by a Category 5 
<br>
hurricane.  Imagine the payout crisis around, say, 2050, 
<br>
with all the coral dead and the seas rising along entire 
<br>
continental coastlines.  There are serious people in the 
<br>
re-insurance industry who claim that weather damage in the 
<br>
2050s will outmatch the planet's entire GNP.  Smashing 
<br>
skyscrapers with aircraft full of blazing fossil fuel -- 
<br>
that is by no means a Greenhouse disaster, it's just  a 
<br>
war crime.  But that event is of the scope and scale of 
<br>
the disasters that society is courting.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only event that can match NYC 9.11 for sudden 
<br>
loss of American civilian life is the Great Galveston 
<br>
Hurricane of 1900. That's an event from which Galveston, 
<br>
once the rival of New Orleans and the richest port in 
<br>
Texas, never recovered.  Now we have a modern model for a 
<br>
major-league Greenhouse unnatural calamity.  We now know 
<br>
what that does to people, to their morale and confidence, 
<br>
to the tenor of their society. We must not go there out of 
<br>
bland incredulity and some dismissive notion that things 
<br>
like that can never happen. And if we do go for there, for 
<br>
some godforsaken reason, we need coherent plans to claw 
<br>
our way back out.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However: we Viridians are not going to be doing that 
<br>
clawing.  That is frankly beyond our capacity.  That is 
<br>
the realm of Khaki Green, the realm of hardhats tearing 
<br>
through rubble heaps 24/7, and if the Pope-Emperor gets 
<br>
into that line of work, he is not going to be doing a lot 
<br>
of whimsical email.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Viridians are going to continue to promote cool 
<br>
green gizmos == although we no longer expect to sell quite 
<br>
as many.  And we will watch weird  weather.  We may very 
<br>
well change our list mechanics, those stars, the chevrons 
<br>
and so forth; we may be moving into new alliances and new 
<br>
areas of the Web.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore.  Instead of being the cheering groupies 
<br>
and advocates of our dear friends the designers, we are, 
<br>
if necessary,  going to *commiserate* with designers, we 
<br>
are going to offer *solidarity* and *unfeigned moral 
<br>
support* to designers, and to their critics, and their 
<br>
teachers, and their stricken magazines and their stricken 
<br>
retailers; we Viridians don't care if you noble souls are 
<br>
at the top of Fortune's Wheel or suddenly considered the 
<br>
excrescences of a decadent consumer society, we get it 
<br>
about that business-cycle crap and we love you anyway, and 
<br>
we Viridians are *with you people to our final Internet 
<br>
packet.*   What we can do for you, we're gonna. Don't be a 
<br>
stranger.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I'm going to be travelling a lot.  
<br>
Because the planes are empty and people are asking.  I'm 
<br>
accepting invitations from all over the place. I'm gonna 
<br>
be laying on hands.   There's not a lot of money around on 
<br>
the circuit this quarter, but there is a hell of a lot to 
<br>
talk about, and friends are rarely happier to see one 
<br>
another than they are under these trying circumstances.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next gig is the Renewable Energy Roundup in 
<br>
Fredericksburg Texas, September 28-30.  A very worthy
<br>
affair.
