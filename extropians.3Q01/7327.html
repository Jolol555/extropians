<p>2 points:  1. The 9/11/01 speech was well-written and President Bush's
<br>
delivery was exceptional.  2. Presidents have speech writers who put into
<br>
writing what the Presidents and their advisers tell them to.  In this case,
<br>
&nbsp;President Bush tells the writers what he wants to deliver then reads the
<br>
draft and approves it or, if the speech writers misinterpret the sentiment
<br>
of the president or his advisors, they have a rewrite.  
<br>
<p>best,
