<p><em>&gt;Just to clarify my confusion here -- isn't there a rather nice transhumanist

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Let me try to address your question by providing a little background.  I
<br>
had intended the site Transhuman.org to be an overall information center
<br>
(InfoMark) for transhumanity and address questions and issues for the
<br>
public.  However, people need information provided as clearly and directly
<br>
as possible so a FAQ seemed the best way to go.  
<br>
<p>The new TranshumanistFAQ.com will provide an assortment of information and
<br>
will pool knowledge from varied groups, including ExI, Transcedo, Aleph,
<br>
WTA, as well as quote-contributions from Minsky, Kurzweil, Walford, Vinge,
<br>
Michael Rose, Michael West, Greg Fahy, etc.,  with special focus on
<br>
different interpretations of terms (what is a transhuman -  to different
<br>
views on the singularity (Broderick, Vinge, Eli, Kurzweil, etc.).  It also
<br>
has information on early pioneers, culture, and issues we currently face.   
<br>
<p>Another important point is that the Transhumanist FAQ at
<br>
TranshumanistFAQ.com is a compilation of writings over the years, so there
<br>
is some insight that will be historically beneficial to those wanting to
<br>
learn more about transhumanism, and there is much information about future
<br>
directions of transhumanism based on the current global and social landscape.
<br>
<p>Many people provided information to WTA's transhumanist FAQ, and their
<br>
contributions are what make WTA's FAQ so good.  Much of their contributions
<br>
will be included in the TranshumanistFAQ.com site.  The only pause I have
<br>
had about WTA's FAQ is that there are some inconsistencies that slide over
<br>
the cultural, historical, and future points while placing much emphasis on
<br>
technology.  I never considered WTA's FAQ the key FAQ on transhumanism.
<br>
Extropy Institute had a FAQ on transhumanism back in the early 1990s and
<br>
Ander's website is usually considered the key transhumanist source.  I
<br>
realize that WTA's FAQ gathered some information from ExI's faq and which
<br>
TranshumanistFAQ.com does so also.
<br>
<p>So, long and short - ExI's Transhumanist FAQ, Ander's transhumanism
<br>
website, Transhuman.org website, and WTA's FAQ are all benefical.  I,
<br>
however, decided to dig deep into the core of transhumanity and get some
<br>
original information on transhumanism and compile it with current updated
<br>
information and deal more with our culture.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
