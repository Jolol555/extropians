<p>Yes, compact fluorescent is the way to go today, and for the last 8
<br>
years. The only time you should be playing with standard fluorescent is
<br>
when you are dealing with large amounts of pre-existing large diameter
<br>
lamps with magnetic ballasts, or when you need to illuminate large rooms
<br>
like conference or classrooms. These 3, 4, 8, and 12 foot fixtures can
<br>
be refurbished from the T-12 lamps to smaller diameter T-8 lamps and new
<br>
electronic ballasts generally cheaper than replacing the entire fixture
<br>
with a new one.
<br>
<p>The only real concerns with this process, of course, are with toxic
<br>
waste disposal. Some of the oldest magnetic ballasts have PCBs in them,
<br>
and the older T-12 lamps have measurable quantities of mercury in them.
<br>
These components should be handled with care (rubber gloves) and stored
<br>
properly (steel or PVC drum for the ballasts, cardboard boxes for the
<br>
lamps) until they can be disposed of. There are companies that will pick
<br>
up and recycle/dispose of these materials. The ballasts, for example,
<br>
are incinerated to burn off the PCBs into its constituent atoms and
<br>
recover the metals of the capacitors and inductors.
<br>
<p>If your facility has a full time facilities maintenance dept, they
<br>
should handle this, and can contact the local utility for information on
<br>
disposal of old components.
<br>
<p>Compact fluorescent lamps can be purchased at your local hardware stores
<br>
to thread into your incandescent light sockets. I do recommend, however,
<br>
that you contact your utility's conservation department first to find
<br>
out what sort of rebates you can obtain on the purchase of different
<br>
fixtures. Since the utility is interested in long term permanent
<br>
reductions in demand, it will focus its money on CF devices that cannot
<br>
be retrofitted with incandescent lamps at any time in the future. Using
<br>
their rebates, you could obtain new fixtures for the cost of the screw
<br>
in lamps retail price, depending on how desperate the utility is to
<br>
conserve. Some customers may enjoy a 100% rebate level. The utility
<br>
generally does not provide more than a 10-25% rebate on screw in CF
<br>
lamps because not only can they be replaced in the future with
<br>
incandescent, but you could also take the bulbs with you if you moved
<br>
out of the service area of that utility.
