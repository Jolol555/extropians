<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Even Richard Stallman, the most hard-line free software advocate doesn't

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; free speech, not free beer.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yet his purpose in launching the GNU was to drive his former colleagues

<em>&gt; &gt; into the ground without making a profit, thus keeping his 'hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; clean'... Stallman is nobody that should be held up for respect or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; adulation in the open source movement. It is he who is primarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; responsible for the degree of socialist ideology  in OSM.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bullshit.  There is nothing to justify this wild assertion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except your dim memory of some magazine article sometime in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past that could have well got it very much wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Bullshit yourself, Samantha. I've specifically referenced the writer who
<br>
made that assertion in Billboard Magazine, and he was specifically
<br>
quoting a Stallman interview in BYTE magazine years before. For you to
<br>
contest this, you'd have to show he never actually made that interview
<br>
and admitted those things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Stallman is a saint.  He saw something he considered wrong and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limiting and he devoted himself to offering an alternative at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tremendous personal cost.  Profit is irrelevant to what he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerned with and anyone who reads him knows this.  There is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of vengeance there.  Besides, if that were his motive he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would embrace the Open Source world fully instead of continuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to distinquish what he thinks is important from what has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most potential to change the face of software broadly right now.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it is that motive that prevents him from embracing the OS
<br>
world fully, rather than just staying in his snotty little GNU corner
<br>
and pouting as he has been doing.
<br>
<p>GNU is not the only OS methodology, and it is actually a rather weak and
<br>
pontificating one at that. The FreeBSD movement, for example, is far
<br>
more saintly.
