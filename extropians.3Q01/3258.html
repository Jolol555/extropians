<p>I think you mischaracterize Michael's attitude towards military service.
<br>
The description of military service is pretty accurate in my experience.  I
<br>
think it has less to do with Michael having a chip on his shoulder than it
<br>
does with the fact that he has been there and done that.  Having also served
<br>
in the military, I wouldn't really have characterized anything he stated
<br>
differently.  The description may appear a bit jaded or cynical to the
<br>
outsider, but it does reflect reality.
