<em>&gt; You have shown no explicit contradictions an anything I said.
</em><br>
<p>You made the asked us, in your Sunday, August 26, 2001 12:00 PM post, to:
<br>
<p>&quot;Consider each fact we hold dear in terms of the sociological environment in
<br>
place at the time that fact came into being. Consider whatever political and
<br>
religious controversies. The point is, any arbitrary fact or piece of
<br>
knowledge could have been constructed at that time, and what was constructed
<br>
met the demand and dynamic nature of that environment. If constructed
<br>
knowledge proves useful, can be built upon, or in some other way exhibits
<br>
survivability, that knowledge remains. If not it goes away and is superseded
<br>
by something else. The knowledge we have exhibits the exploratory and
<br>
adaptive nature of mankind. We manufacture knowledge to meet our needs and
<br>
wants rather than discover it.&quot;
<br>
<p>There are several claims made in this quote.  Let's separate them.
<br>
<p>One is that &quot;any arbitrary fact or piece of knowledge could have been
<br>
constructed at that time...&quot;
<br>
<p>Another is &quot;what was constructed met the demand and dynamic nature of that
<br>
environment.&quot;
<br>
<p>Following all this is &quot;We manufacture knowledge to meet our needs and wants
<br>
rather than discover it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now this last claims is an time of knowledge, right?
<br>
<p>Is it true?  If it is true, then it must apply to itself, right?  If so,
<br>
then it must be manufactured and not discovered.  Yet knowledge that is
<br>
manufactured is really not knowledge at all.  Instead, it merely suits some
<br>
other purpose.
<br>
<p>Or do you mean your statement to apply to only some subset of knowledge?  In
<br>
that case, then we could focus on the subset that it does not apply to.  In
<br>
fact, if it only applies to a subset, then the claim is much less bold and
<br>
becomes a truism.  (Just like &quot;Some of what you believe right now is false.&quot;
<br>
Does this statement mean anything goes or that everything you believe is
<br>
false?  Or that there's no way of separating truth from falsehood -- however
<br>
rough or fallible?
<br>
<p>If it is false, then your whole rant is false.
<br>
<p>But even more to the point, how would you know it is true?  You would need
<br>
to know something about reality and something about knowledge of reality?
<br>
Why would you need to know?  To even make sense of the statement, you have
<br>
to be able to compare a given item of knowledge to reality and show that a)
<br>
it enhance survival or is otherwise useful and b) that it does not
<br>
necessarily match reality.  Usefulness is a fact, too, as is
<br>
&quot;survivability.&quot;  In order to know if something is useful, one must have
<br>
some knowledge of the things it's useful for.
<br>
<p>All these claims commit the genetic fallacy -- or what Rand called the
<br>
fallacy of the stolen concept.  (You don't have to accept her other views to
<br>
accept this fallacy as a true fallacy in reasoning.)  This means, simply
<br>
put, an idea which denies that on which it logically depends.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person uses semantics to criticise semantics is in no way invalid. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you suggest I use?
</em><br>
<p>I suggest you clean up your logic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I ask you again to justify your criticism.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I have.  That Lee Corbin number my criticisms seems to show someone
<br>
else got it too.  (It would also be nice if you followed his formating
<br>
suggestions.  It would make it easier for others to read your posts.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>
