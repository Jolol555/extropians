Actually, I feel that it is relatively certain that we cannot agree 
<br>
(perfectly) on values.  This goes all the way back to the point 
<br>
that if two children have access to a piece of candy, only one of 
<br>
them can eat it.  They may be friends, but each will value most 
<br>
highly the outcome that benefits them.  There is no logical way 
<br>
around this.   Now how severe the conflict is will depend on 
<br>
several things, for example, how hungry each is.  But that the 
<br>
valuations will be different is inescapable.  They aren't using the 
<br>
same sensory organs.  The candy that I taste isn't tasted by you.
<br>
<p>I'm not even bringing in the social conflicts:  &quot;I'm not hungry 
<br>
now, but if I don't eat it, then she will eat it, and I won't be 
<br>
able to eat it later, when I would want to, so I'll eat it now.&quot;  
<br>
(Were you to ask me if that was rational, I'd be forced to say no, 
<br>
but I almost remember thinking that and making that decision.  It 
<br>
was accompanied by a feel of defiance... that isn't the decision 
<br>
that my mother would want me to make.)
<br>
<p>And this was with me sister.  This was with the person I 
<br>
occasionally risked physical injury to defend.  Not some stranger, 
<br>
with whom I wouldn't have the shared &quot;family&quot;ness.  I was less 
<br>
willing to share with strangers.  (I find myself quite convinced by 
<br>
Dawkins &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; ... the predictions that it makes seem 
<br>
to match those that I have been able to observe around me.  And the 
<br>
arguments aren't unreasonable... they merely require a different 
<br>
point of view than was standard in school.)
