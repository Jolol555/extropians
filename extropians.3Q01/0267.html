<em>&gt; [Michael Lorrey quoting &quot;Fire Safety Regulation in Northeastern Santiago,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chile&quot; by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John M. Cobin at: <a href="http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume3/v3i1a2s1.html">http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume3/v3i1a2s1.html</a> ]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This paper extends my previous study of fire safety regulation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Baltimore by presenting similar evidence from northeastern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Santiago. Like the dramatic increase in Baltimore through 1994,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; structural fires per capita in northeastern Santiago have soared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 8.9 times since regulation began in 1929 despite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;      massive increases in building safety regulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is a faulty premise. Under fire safety regulations, imposed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; goverment fiat or insurance requirements,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think there's a big difference between the two -- between &quot;government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fiat&quot; and &quot;insurance requirements.&quot;  The latter is voluntary, the former
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mandatory.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but the difference is irrelevant to this particular debate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one SHOULD expect an inrease
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the number of fires per capita. Decreasing the incidence of fires is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; NOT the goal of fire safety regs. The purpose is to reduce the overall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; damage and death toll of each individual fire.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But Cobin does go over just this point in the third section of the essay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume3/v3i1a2s3.html">http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume3/v3i1a2s3.html</a>) when discussing Santiago's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building code:  &quot;The legislation was designed to establish compulsory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construction norms for minimum and maximum building height and the selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of building materials, plus a means to retard the propagation of fires...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This code was put into place in 1929, &quot;after a disastrous earthquake struck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Talca [another Chilean city] in 1928...&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but the fact that he bases his initial premise so faultily condemns
<br>
the whole exercise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Without fire safety regs, large dense cities frequently had a huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; devastating fire every few years or decades. One fire would cause untold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deaths and the loss of thousands of homes and businesses. Today, each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individual fire that occurs is generally contained within its building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or within a small part of a building due to the required use of fire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; retardant matnerials, and deaths would be minor due to required
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; installation of fire safety equipment (like extinguishers, fire escapes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; smoke alarms, and public education).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would hazard to guess -- but confess ignorance here:) -- that, in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past, most fires, too were small and contained.  It wasn't like London
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burned done once a decade.  You make it sound as if it did.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps not the whole city, but large chunks of it did, in fact. Tell
<br>
me: how many wooden structures remain in London proper that are more
<br>
than 250 years old? Very few. How about Chicago? Very few. 
<br>
<p>A proper study would chart out the percent of individual cities killed,
<br>
injured, and left homeless from fire every year before and after the
<br>
institution of fire codes in those cities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What we would need to do is find out if government fire codes have had the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impact you believe they have.
</em><br>
<p>Groups like the ICBO, BOCA, etc. have done numerous studies in the past
<br>
on this subject illustrating just my point.
