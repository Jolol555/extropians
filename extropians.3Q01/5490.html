<p>
It's hopeless to expect Korzybskian rigor from the
<br>
entertainment industry - politicians, academics,
<br>
journalists (as if they were separate orders!) - but here,
<br>
I think, we can differentiate among primary, secondary,
<br>
and university expectation/ performance ratios.
<br>
<p>I have to agree with Mike Lorrey and others that the
<br>
current U.S. primary school system fails to provide
<br>
literacy, numeracy, knowledge of the physical environment,
<br>
and understanding of the political system.  Whether this
<br>
is a true vision, whether and how it can be corrected, are
<br>
topics on the table.
<br>
<p>My own view is that the problems in education have the
<br>
same roots as  those in health care:  the people incurring
<br>
the costs are not the people paying the price, and the
<br>
entertainer class has insinuated itself between the
<br>
principals.  To the extent that being little- e extropian
<br>
means seeing a swirling mob of yoots and geezers rioting
<br>
in the road ahead, and means seeing the absolute necessity
<br>
of proceeding down that road, I think the distribution of
<br>
these social necessities wants extrapolitical analysis.
<br>
<p>Wonder what it would take to induce ETS to administer the
<br>
College Entrance Examination battery of, say, 1960, and
<br>
then release the raw scores of then and now?  If it were
<br>
just a matter of money, could the Libertarian Party USA
<br>
raise the scratch?
<br>

RKBA!
