Not sure where to start here. 
<br>
Firstly, Britain is not and has no wish ever to be, at war with Ireland or
<br>
Northern Ireland.
<br>
The troops are not &quot;occupying&quot; Northern Ireland anymore than US troops
<br>
&quot;occupy&quot; Texas. They are there to ensure, in partnership with the police,
<br>
the rule of law in the face of continued and ongoing terrorist attacks. In
<br>
fact, in line with the Good Friday agreement, the number of troops in the
<br>
province has been dramatically reduced over recent years. The fact that the
<br>
IRA, supported by a number of misguided but secure American citizens, have
<br>
failed to deliver on any aspect of the agreement is not one that should be
<br>
overlooked.

<em>&gt;This is the single biggest crock I've ever heard. Britain most

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Who are the biggest supporters of Ireland in America? The millions

<em>&gt;see Britain as totally wrong when it comes to Ireland. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Want to end the &quot;troubles&quot;? I can do it for you. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1) U.N. Declaration: &quot;The territory known as Northern Ireland is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hearby recognized as part of Ireland, subject to its laws, and no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other nation.&quot; 
</em><br>
Sorry, but the majority of the inhabitants of Northern Ireland do not wish
<br>
to be part of Ireland. Hence the creation of the province in the first
<br>
place.
<br>
<em>&gt;2) Remove British troops occupying Northern Ireland, replace with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;U.N. peacekeepers. Make it clear to both sides that terrorism is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outlawed and will be treated/prosecuted equally. 
</em><br>
Er, actually terrorism is already against the law and all offending parties
<br>
are currently pursued to the full extent of the law. 
<br>
<em>&gt;3) British subjects who wish to remain in Northern Ireland are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;granted dual citizenship and permanent residency status.
</em><br>
In case there was any doubt, I should reiterate that the UK remains firmly
<br>
behind the US - we feel for your loss (indeed we have lost many of our own
<br>
people) and understand the desire for justice and revenge. Having suffered
<br>
terrorist attacks for the last 30 years, the only consistently successful
<br>
policy for dealing with these people is to find them, prosecute them, punish
<br>
them and then to either remove the cause of their complaint (if genuine) or
<br>
to find some other way to address the problem. This isn't easy.
