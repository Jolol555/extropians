<p>
I think that the survival of the First World and Western Civilization is
<br>
definitely at stake.  If transhumans are ever to make it to posthumans,
<br>
it can only happen in an educated, sophisticated, technologically
<br>
literate, capitalist democratic society as found in US, Europe, and Japan -
<br>
essentially the industrialized First World.  The undeveloped Third World
<br>
such as Afghanistan, much of South America, most of Africa and some of
<br>
Asia will, it seems, never make it.  Some countries like India and Pacific
<br>
islands like Taiwan and Singapore may be able to upgrade their countries
<br>
from Third World to First World, otherwise, the rest may need to go
<br>
extinct like the dinosaurs.
<br>
<p>Futurists a decade ago called this bifurcation the North South economic
<br>
conflict  between wealthy Northern Hemisphere nations and poor,
<br>
impoverished Southern Hemisphere nations.  The East West political
<br>
conflict of Eastern Hemispheric Soviet (Second World) nations and
<br>
Western Hemispheric, democratic nations is the other conflict that has
<br>
somewhat subsided at least in the classic Cold War bipolar US vs. USSR
<br>
dual superpowers scenario.   What is happening is totalitarianism is now
<br>
mixed with Islam instead of Marx (for the East West conflict) and
<br>
the North South conflict of  First and Third World is more alive than ever
<br>
<p>Actively exterminating terrorists is essential if First World transhumans
<br>
are
<br>
ever to make it to the 22nd century.  The Pentagon's Strategic Defense
<br>
Initiative (SDI) or &quot;Star Wars&quot; program is really intended to fend off
<br>
nuclear blackmail from the Third World.  Such nuclear blackmail would
<br>
take the form of &quot;give us  your money, food, medicine, etc. for free or
<br>
we will nuke New York City&quot;  SDI would simply counter their missiles
<br>
and kill them.  The Third World must &quot;die&quot;  by upgrading to First World
<br>
status by going for capitalism and foreign investment like India appears to
<br>
be doing or die by the intertribal/civil war combined with the infection and
<br>
starvation that comes with unrestricted overpopulation. - William.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As to intervening in the rest of the globe or not, the US may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done it in exaggeration in the past, but won't they now be FORCED to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do it more and more, as the dangers grow with the destructiveness of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; malevolent (sorry Pat, to be such Manicheist) power develops out of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this is pretty much an extropian topic, as one of the problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the extropian plan is to know whether we will live to see it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening / make it happen. For the large view of it, again, I think
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you agree with such necessity in the long run ? Do you connect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present situation to this necessity, or think that we speak of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different time scales ? Do you think that the present attitude of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US is ahead or behind of such necessity ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I realize that, specially for an American, it may be difficult to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speak out on this, as no one wants to seem arrogant. On the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand, if there is some urgency, shouldn't we openly face these things ?
