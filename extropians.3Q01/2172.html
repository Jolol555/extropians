<em>&gt; I shall have to sit down and think about that. The use of what basically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be information and processing power as a fundamental indestructible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantity akin to energy in this particular context is something else I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to sit down and think about.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, if information is indestructible, then no one need lament the burning of
<br>
the Alexandrian library.

<em>&gt; Without getting into that argument about exact definitions... Id say this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blows the hell out of Moore's law if its true ;)
</em><br>
<p>According to Deutsch, &quot;When you succeed, all the copies of you who made the
<br>
same decision succeed too. What you do for the better increases the portion of
<br>
the multiverse where good things happen.&quot; So, Moore's law works just fine, for
<br>
all the copies of Moore that made the same decision.
<br>
<p>&quot;This makes the choice between them purely a matter of taste,
<br>
roughly equivalent to whether one believes mathematical language or human
<br>
language
<br>
to be more fundamental.&quot; --Max Tegmark
<br>
<p>The difficulty involved in putting that statement into mathematical language
<br>
persuades me of the more fundamental nature of human language. It's easier
<br>
(for me) to communicate the existence of Many Worlds in words than numbers.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is concluded that no plausible set of axioms exists for an MWI
<br>
that describes known physics.&quot; --Adrian Kent
<br>
<p>IOW, even if MWI is correct, it doesn't really matter, since it changes
<br>
nothing in our tangible, everyday lives. That was the case with atomic theory
<br>
before the bomb.
<br>
<p>&quot;I shall show that the apparently 'non-local' expectation value for the
<br>
product of the spins of two widely separated particles --- the 'quantum' part
<br>
of Bell's Theorem --- is really due to a series
<br>
of three purely local measurements. Thus, experiments confirming 'nonlocality'
<br>
are actually
<br>
confirming the MWI.&quot; --Frank J. Tipler
<br>
<p>Confirmation suffices for theory. Perhaps someday a sensational demonstration
<br>
will convince the rest of _this_ particular world, although many other worlds
<br>
are (according to MWI) already convinced.
<br>
<p>&quot;In single-history theories, each history is weighted simply by its
<br>
quantum-mechanical probability, but in many-worlds theories in which random
<br>
observations are considered, there should also be the weighting by the numbers
<br>
or amounts of observations occurring in each history.&quot; --Don N. Page
<br>
<p>Right, for every &quot;world&quot; there must be an observer, and a &quot;world&quot; for every
<br>
observer (or collection of observers). This implies a relativistic consensus
<br>
reality in which observation creates existence (and  Sartre be damned).
<br>
<p>In reality there may be many worlds, but only one reality (aka, existence).
<br>
<p><p>©¿©¬
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, and ego.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
