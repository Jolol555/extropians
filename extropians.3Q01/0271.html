<p><p><em>&gt;Steve Davies writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Tampa police are using three dozen security cameras
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; equipped with face-recognition software to search for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; criminal suspects among people in a downtown district.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;What is so bad about this idea?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I can think of several problems (quite apart from the general
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; issue of an &quot;expectation of privacy&quot; which was alluded to).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But would one feel that one's privacy were invaded by actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human detectives surveying crowds with binoculars?  They used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to, you know.  I recall reading about how in England one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;detective was so obsessed with the Great Train Robbery that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he spent most of his free time watching crowds for his man.
</em><br>
<p>Well yes actually. I don't know the instance you refer to but I'll bet he
<br>
got a load of grief if he was found out.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 2. This use of technology can be misused in all sorts of obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and dangerous ways by goverments and law enfocement agencies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Of course you are free to believe the police would never misuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; their power, or that governments are completely benign institutions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but then I would soon expect to see flights of migrating pigs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Quite right.  But still, perhaps I don't fully understand what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the difference is between this and conventional surveillance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How excited would anyone have been a number of years ago if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the London constabulary had made it known that a certain human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;policeman had a photographic memory, an uncanny eye, and was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being used to watch large crowds?  Yawn.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Take the extreme case if you want:  the police have public cameras
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everywhere, and a database of driver's license pictures.  All they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need to do is type in someone's name, and if he or she is out in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;public anywhere, they can monitor that person.  How different in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principle is this from having a detective assigned to follow that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;person?  Are we merely objecting to efficiency?  (Again, I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sure that anyone would ever had objected if it were known, say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the Liverpool police happened to have an unlimited budget
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for surveillance by human policemen, and could authorize that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyone or any number of people be followed.)  Thanks, Lee
</em><br>
<p><p>I get your drift, my reponse is, no it isn't just efficiency or the use of
<br>
technology that is objected to. Many people would object to the kind of
<br>
hypothetical case you describe, after all this is what despotic regimes have
<br>
been up to for a long time and people objected to that. The increased
<br>
efficiency simply makes it worse since it makes this kind of surveillance
<br>
easier and cheaper, but it was wrong in the first place. Having said that,
<br>
there is an argument that modern technology makes possible a degree of
<br>
surveillance and control that was not even theoretically possible before, so
<br>
there is also a qualitative shift. It's interesting to speculate how people
<br>
would react if we did get a transparent society with effectively constant
<br>
surveillance, a kind of society wide panopticon. Perhaps we'll all start
<br>
behaving like the inhabitants of the Big Brother house :).Steve Davies
