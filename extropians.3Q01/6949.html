<p>SAS to join American special forces
<br>
<p><p>By Macer Hall, Philip Sherwell and Christina Lamb -
<br>
<p>SAS troops are preparing to join American special forces in a swoop aimed at
<br>
devastating terrorist training camps in Afghanistan under plans for a swift
<br>
retaliation for last week's outrages.
<br>
<p>Air Strikes on Osama bin Laden's strongholds could begin within a week,
<br>
according to US officials. One officer in the British security services told
<br>
The Telegraph that action would start &quot;within days&quot;. The air assault - along
<br>
with cruise missile attacks - will soften up targets before elite troops go
<br>
in on &quot;search and destroy&quot; missions.
<br>
<p>The special forces troops were being briefed while the biggest build-up of
<br>
military might since the Gulf War was going on in preparation for the West's
<br>
war against terrorism.
<br>
<p>The soldiers will be dropped in by helicopter to seal off and lay waste to
<br>
at least six sites believed to be used by bin Laden supporters, in plans
<br>
drawn up by military strategists. The special forces attacks will follow an
<br>
initial wave of cruise missile strikes then a second wave of aerial carpet
<br>
bombing to soften up targets.
<br>
<p>A senior Pentagon official said yesterday that &quot;pinpoint air strikes&quot;
<br>
without ground attacks - similar to those used against bin Laden in the
<br>
past - were not an option.
<br>
<p>He said: &quot;The strategy this time is we are going to go in hard and we are
<br>
going to get it right. The political and public will is there. We know there
<br>
will be casualties if we send troops in and we are prepared to accept that
<br>
after what happened on Tuesday.&quot;
<br>
<p>The first retaliatory strike is likely to be a barrage of Tomahawk cruise
<br>
missiles from destroyers supporting the US aircraft carrier Carl Vincent,
<br>
currently in the Gulf. The warship will move east, with its battle group of
<br>
more than 10 surface ships and a nuclear submarine, to a position off
<br>
Pakistan.
<br>
<p>Strategists have identified at least six training camps and military bases
<br>
for attack. First on the list is the hideaway at Shar-i-Nau, a suburb of
<br>
Kandahar, which in January was the last place bin Laden was sighted.
<br>
<p>Also understood to be in line for air raids are sites at Farmada outside
<br>
Jalalabad, Darunta in Nangahar, bases near Khost and Kabul and a remote
<br>
bunker hidden in the Hindu Kush mountains in the north-east of Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>Strikes against targets in Afghanistan are seen as only part of America's
<br>
war against terrorism. Offensives against other targets, most specifically
<br>
Saddam Hussein in Iraq, were understood to be under preparation last night.
<br>
<p>The key to success in Afghanistan is establishing bases in neighbouring
<br>
territory in Pakistan or Tajikistan to unleash special forces units into
<br>
attack. Any agreements on setting up bases are expected to remain secret.
<br>
<p>Special forces - including airborne units from America's Special Operations
<br>
Command and members of the SAS - are seen as the best way of demonstrating
<br>
the ability to launch a devastating ground assault while avoiding the danger
<br>
of being drawn into a protracted conflict with guerrilla forces in
<br>
forbidding mountain territory. The strike force would stay no longer than a
<br>
few days.
<br>
<p>The Pentagon official added: &quot;We do not see this as a repeat of the Soviet
<br>
attempt to conquer the country in the 1980s or the British during the 19th
<br>
century. We do not want to occupy.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bin Laden's movements are now under 24-hour scrutiny by spy satellites and
<br>
his communications are monitored by electronic eavesdropping devices, said
<br>
intelligence officials.
<br>
<p>The CIA has also paid Afghan tribesmen to watch for the armoured vehicles in
<br>
which bin Laden travels and to report back their whereabouts, although
<br>
American officials acknowledge that it is extremely hard to keep tabs on his
<br>
entourage in the rugged mountainous terrain.
<br>
<p>In a reversal of the 1980s, events in Afghanistan are bringing Washington
<br>
and Moscow into a possible military alliance against their common enemy, bin
<br>
Laden. Twenty years ago, the US backed the likes of bin Laden against the
<br>
Soviet occupying force.
<br>
<p>Under the high-stakes strategy, the country's Taliban rulers will be told
<br>
that if they use military force to oppose the strikes on bin Laden, their
<br>
bases will also be targeted in the offensive.
<br>
<p>America is also negotiating with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, who
<br>
despises bin Laden because of his support for Islamic militants and
<br>
terrorists in Chechnya and the former Soviet republics in Central Asia. US
<br>
intelligence sources say that Russia may provide access to Afghanistan
<br>
through Russia's ally, Tajikistan, on Afghanistan's northern border.
<br>
<p>There is talk in American intelligence circles of Mr Putin providing reports
<br>
from his own spies on bin Laden's whereabouts. There could also be offers to
<br>
join an American commando invasion force for a joint Russian-American effort
<br>
to capture or kill the terrorist and the use of Russian helicopter pilots,
<br>
some of whom know the tortuous terrain from the days of the Soviet invasion.
<br>
<p>Such moves would be incredibly dangerous but, following the attacks on the
<br>
American mainland, Mr Bush is prepared to suffer substantial troop losses.
<br>
The Pentagon hopes that ground troops would sweep through the mountains
<br>
aiming to trap bin Laden and his commanders and either kill them in a
<br>
firefight or capture them and bring them to America for trial.
<br>
<p>The US already has plenty of firepower within striking range, with cruise
<br>
missile-armed warships from the 5th and 7th fleets and a nuclear submarine
<br>
in the Gulf and Indian Ocean. Further air-launched missiles could be
<br>
delivered from B-52 bombers using the island of Diego Garcia as a staging
<br>
post.
<br>
<p>British aircraft, including Tornado bombers armed with laser-guided bombs
<br>
and Nimrod surveillance aircraft, are also based in Gulf states.
<br>
<p>The US has at its disposal a wide range of units under its Special Operation
<br>
Command, including more than 46,000 troops. Most likely to be involved in
<br>
attacking the landlocked, mountainous terrain of Afghanistan is the US
<br>
Army's Delta Force. Other special force units that could be called in
<br>
include the 160th Aviation Regiment, known as the Night Stalkers, and the
<br>
75th Ranger Regiment.
<br>
<p>The terrain in Afghanistan will mean paratroops or aeroplanes are unlikely
<br>
to be favoured for deploying ground forces, at least in the first wave of
<br>
attack.
<br>
<p>US troops are expected to be landed by powerful CH-53E Super Stallion
<br>
helicopters, which are capable of carrying up to 80 fully armed personnel
<br>
and able to be refuelled by dedicated Hercules tanker aircraft.
<br>
<p>Troops from the Special Air Service are almost certainly to be used in any
<br>
operation, both to emphasise that retaliation will not be carried out by the
<br>
US acting alone, and because the British elite force is highly regarded by
<br>
its American counterparts, who have a much broader concept of &quot;special
<br>
forces&quot;. Regular troops will be called in if a ground assault is launched
<br>
against Iraq.
<br>
<p>Britain has growing numbers of forces in the Middle East. Heading for the
<br>
month-long manoeuvres in Oman are 27,000 troops, an armoured division of
<br>
Challenger tanks and a Navy task force, including the aircraft carrier
<br>
Illustrious. (Telegraph)
