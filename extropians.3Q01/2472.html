</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee, could you have another go at explaining what you're asking for. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honestly find the above a bit cryptic in the way it's expressed.
</em><br>
<p>I meant to say, are there really people who don't agree that
<br>
&quot;you have to have a *theory* of what makes laws good and bad
<br>
before condemning particular laws&quot;?   I mean, that just seems
<br>
so obvious.  I sort of can't imagine what it would be like 
<br>
for someone not to do that.  But then, maybe I misunderstood
<br>
what Daniel was saying.  Also, my question might be so lame
<br>
that it's not even wrong  :-)  If so, don't hesitate to say
<br>
so.  Thanks anyway, 
<br>

<em>&gt; Daniel said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I did not think you were a statist, though I did think you were a legal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;positivist -- in my use of the term.  (Perhaps my usage is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misinterpretation.  I'll have to sleep on that.:)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I'd say I'm in the tradition of Hart and Raz, if that helps. I don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think either of them rules out moral critiques of the law - *I* certainly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't. While their views are highly complex, I think they'd essentially say 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that bad laws are (1) bad but (2) nonetheless laws. This strikes me as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commonsense, but some natural law theorists would say that sufficiently bad 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws are not laws at all, even if they have pretty compelling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characteristics of legal norms such as appearing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the statute books.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point I was trying to make was a simple one, that you have to have a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *theory* of what makes laws good and bad before condemning particular laws, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not just say, for example, that taxation looks awfully like theft in some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways, *therefore* &quot;taxation is theft&quot;. I'm not saying such moral critiques 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the law can't be done, or that Jerry was necessarily making such an error 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I just described. I just wanted to probe him a bit on what his theory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was, including what political or legal philosophy he might have been using. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He seems to be relying a lot on Ayn Rand. And he doesn't seem to have minded 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my gentle probing too much. (Right, Jerry? Jerry??)  :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;My point on political philosophy was not to belittle you (or anyone),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but just to show that the answers you want might require a wider net than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the one you are casting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay. Good to have that cleared up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cheers!
</em><br>
