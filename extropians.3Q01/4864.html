Mark said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;J L Mackie
</em><br>
<em>&gt;famously argued that all moral truths are false because there are no moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;facts, i.e., morality does not exist. Mackie and other error theorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Nietzsche is sometimes interpreted this way) do not say that moral truths
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are relative to some social group, rather all such claims are false.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. As I understand Mackie, he says that there are no objective moral
<br>
properties, etc. However, our moral discourse implies/assumes that there
<br>
are. Therefore, the propositions in our moral discourse are false. Actually,
<br>
I find this pretty persuasive, so I maybe I should call myself an &quot;error
<br>
theorist&quot; rather than an &quot;ethical subjectivist&quot;. A stricter subjectivist
<br>
position might be that the statements in our moral discourse are
<br>
psychological reports, or prescriptions, etc. The error theorist says that
<br>
we make statements which involve more than this and (falsely) include claims
<br>
about objective moral properties, etc.
<br>
<p>Ideally, people like me, who are attracted to Mackie's position should try
<br>
to revise our language so that we no longer seem to make objective moral
<br>
claims, but only give hypothetical recommendations, etc. However, this is
<br>
damn hard.
<br>
<p>Actually, I do find that I can get by from day to day making very few
<br>
*moral* judgments, as opposed to having personal responses, tastes, etc. I
<br>
can certainly get by without such concepts as &quot;sin&quot;, which not only imply
<br>
the existence of an objective morality but tie it to a supernatural being
<br>
against whom we &quot;sin&quot; when we act wrongly. I've largely abandoned the
<br>
concept of &quot;desert&quot;, which has all sorts of problems, and simply work on the
<br>
basis that I just have preferences for people who are talented, disciplined,
<br>
competent, etc.
<br>
<p>There's been a fair bit of public discussion over here of a book called _How
<br>
to Defend Humane Ideals_ by James R. Flynn, an American error theorist, if I
<br>
understand *his* position correctly, who actually tries to do some of the
<br>
hard work of reworking our moral discourse. I haven't had a chance to read
<br>
this yet. Has anyone else seen it? Any opinions? It sounds like an important
<br>
book.
