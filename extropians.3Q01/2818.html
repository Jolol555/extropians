<em>&gt; Actually, it is totally libertarian to pay such taxes, but only if they

</em><br>
<em>&gt; force on others.
</em><br>
<p>It would remain to be proven that such taxes actually reflect externalities.
<br>
But even so, the libertarian way of dealing with externalities is through
<br>
property rights and voluntary agreement -- not through taxes.  See, e.g.,
<br>
Roy Cordato's _Welfare Economics and Externalities in an Open Ended
<br>
Universe_ and Robert Ellickson's _Order Without Law: How Neighbors Settle
<br>
Disputes_.
<br>
<p>(Note for those who don't know what externalities are:  They are costs or
<br>
benefits passed on to others without their consent.  Usually, the ones of
<br>
interest are negative externalities -- i.e., costs passed onto to other
<br>
without their consent.  An example is air pollution.  People usually don't
<br>
complain about positive externalities.  An example is someone beautifying
<br>
their property.  This might provide benefits to his or her neighbors -- in
<br>
terms of property value increase, a more esthetically pleasing neighborhood,
<br>
and the like.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; A libertarian government properly focuses its revinue gathering on use
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; based taxation, while fascist governments focus on confiscatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; taxation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; A libertarian government would not be able to tax period.  It might be
</em><br>
able
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to charge user fees, but these would be for services the government
</em><br>
actually
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; delivers.  A government doesn't deliver a service by forcing people to
</em><br>
pay a
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; tax.  This would include registration fees.  What if I don't want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; register?  (A libertarian government might disavow protecting, say, my
</em><br>
car
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; against theft or vandalism if I don't register it, but it would not be
</em><br>
able
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to use force to make me register.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A libertarian government would impose taxes to account for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; externalities, and would properly funnel those externality fees to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mitigate the damage created by those externalities.
</em><br>
<p>This claim needs a lot more justification than that.  How would a government
<br>
find out what really were externalities?  (Would it be able to determine
<br>
this any better than the market?  If so, how?  If it could do this, I
<br>
submit, it would be a case for socialism.  Not that that's bad in itself,
<br>
but it makes me think it's not possible.)  How would it find out their exact
<br>
amount?  (If it charged more, it would be aggressing.  If it charged less,
<br>
then, by your standards, it would be allowing aggression.)
<br>
<p>Even if it could overcome these very real knowledge problems, would its
<br>
incentives be in the direction of actually limiting itself to this and only
<br>
this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; That said, your semilibertarian -- and it is that: only partly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; libertarian -- government might be better than what we have now in any
</em><br>
place
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; on Earth, but it falls short of the principles you claim to be upholding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It mgiht be a good interim setup, between today's welfare state and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; tomorrow's libertarian society, but it should not be the goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SOrry, a society that does not create some means of properly mitigating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; externalities is not, and cannot hope to be in any way, libertarian.
</em><br>
<p>The proper way of mitigating _negative_ externalities is through defining
<br>
property rights and through voluntary agreements.  E.g., if my next door
<br>
neighbor decides to throw a party that will interfere with my sleep, he and
<br>
I can come to an understanding that I'll have some warning and maybe that
<br>
the music won't go past midnight.  (Or he might invite me over.  Not all
<br>
problems are so easily solved, but force should not be the first line of
<br>
problem solving in these cases.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
