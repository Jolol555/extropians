<p>I wouldn't agree with that at all.
<br>
<p>Reality isn't consensus based.  
<br>
<p>The acceleration due to gravity on this planet existed
<br>
before there was any individual to believe in it...
<br>
and didn't change with changing beliefs as our
<br>
understanding evolved.  Even if we come to a radically
<br>
new understanding of what gravity is, it won't change
<br>
the fact that the acceleration due to gravity on this
<br>
planet is 9.8 m/s/s.
<br>
<p>It's fun to play with &quot;what if&quot; scenarios where
<br>
reality isn't fixed... that it depends on viewpoint...
<br>
but that is all it is... play.  If you try to live
<br>
your life like that you end up a Scientologist... or
<br>
worse.
<br>
<p>Real knowledge is based on real facts... ones that
<br>
don't depend on faith... that are always the same no
<br>
matter who investigates them.
<br>
<p>Pseudo knowledge (much psychiatry, much sociology, all
<br>
religion) is based on beliefs.  Don't let the
<br>
adherents of those dubious bodies of &quot;knowledge&quot; fool
<br>
you with terminology, they don't have facts but
<br>
beliefs.  And when you stop believing, that
<br>
&quot;knowledge&quot; does fall apart.
<br>
<p>The ability to distinguish between reality based facts
<br>
and belief based &quot;facts&quot; is something that our current
<br>
educational system fails to teach to most students.
