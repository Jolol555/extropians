Eric (is that how I should address you?)
<br>
<p>You said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To do otherwise [ie than financing our own society] would mean having to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;row the boat of science against the strong current of oppositon
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm not sure we could raise the money to finance our own society, however. 
<br>
My wife and I have struggled enough just to get the point where we *may* be 
<br>
able to finance ourselves. I doubt that many others are much better off. 
<br>
We'd need a big corporate backer who thought what we were doing was of 
<br>
sufficient value to it to fork out money for the idea. In any event, we have 
<br>
no consensus on the political structure of such a society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and also go against the extropian value of respecting other's opinions, for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if one succeeds in making policy changes to allow transhuman research, one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will inevitably affect everyone else with this change.
</em><br>
<p>This I disagree with. We are entitled to argue against bans on technologies 
<br>
such as cloning, strong AI or whatever. Such argument violates no one's 
<br>
rights (as libertarians say); it in no way impinged in an ethically 
<br>
impermssible manner on other people's freedom to live their own lives (as 
<br>
I'd prefer to say). Sure, a society in which these things are not banned 
<br>
will develop differently from a society in which they are banned, but that 
<br>
does not mean that any &quot;extropian value&quot; has been violated.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Yes, I wish that someone would help with the Sociologistics Project I had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;started with extropian thinking in mind (even though I did not actually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know the term &quot;extropian&quot; yet when I started it). I think it will come in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;handy eventually when we (and other groups) set up independent space 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;colonies. This project also focuses on the often neglected Infostructure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;systems (e.g. political &amp; economical systems) rather than solely on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tangible Infrastructure system (e.g. transportation, defence).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, no one of the few members on the Sociologistics list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sociologistics">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sociologistics</a>) had actively participated in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fomulating useful principles and only one had actually posted to the list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at all. I often wonder why such an important project has so little 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;participation.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps you could tell us a little more about it. I'm sure there are people 
<br>
here (I'm not saying I'd be one of them) who could make some sort of 
<br>
intelligent comment at the lay person's level or even at the professional 
<br>
level. Obviously there are limits to how much time anyone would have to get 
<br>
deeply involved but it sounds like stuff that many transhumanists would 
<br>
think very relevant to their concerns. You'll appreciate that my own 
<br>
comments were more about helping each other with activism/advocacy in favour 
<br>
of freedom and science, but I'd be surprised if your project didn't attract 
<br>
some interest here.
<br>
<p>Russell
