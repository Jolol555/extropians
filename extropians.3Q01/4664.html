<p>Education *was* better when it was
<br>
<em>&gt; completely private and more poor people got a better education.  It isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really even in dispute.  Who's waving arms?
</em><br>
<p>Your insularity is showing.  You say education was better when it was
<br>
completely private and that this isn't even in dispute?  Well, I'm disputing
<br>
it.  What else can't be disputed?  That Gone With The Wind depicted the end
<br>
of the America's greatest epoch?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I didn't mention was the years in the early 19th century when there
</em><br>
was
<br>
<em>&gt; both public AND private education equally available in the U.S.
</em><br>
<p>You also forgot to mention that (during the time you depict) it was
<br>
*illegal* for some people in the U.S. to even learn to read.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So tell me again how public education and the government helped the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor people.
</em><br>
<p>Gladly.  Public education does not sanction discrimination based on
<br>
religion, ethnicity, class, and what have you (that is to say, it has truly
<br>
become more democratic lately - if only in the last few decades - and, in my
<br>
view, the bulk of good it does by this very fact alone puts it ahead of
<br>
private education).
