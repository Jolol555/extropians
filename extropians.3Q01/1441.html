<p>Okay, okay, cool. Thanks. I'll have a look when there's a moment. I'm always 
<br>
prepared to learn something.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What is the difference between classical liberalism and libertarianism?  I

</em><br>
<p>No doubt. Of course, it depends on which version of classical liberalism you 
<br>
adopt and which version of libertarianism. I especially have in mind John 
<br>
Stuart Mill, on one hand, and Robert Nozick on the other, perhaps just 
<br>
because these are the thinkers I happen to have studied with some intensity.
<br>
<p>However, I really mean by &quot;classical liberal&quot; little more than the tradition 
<br>
of Enlightenment liberal thought, as opposed to &quot;liberal&quot; in the American 
<br>
sense, which seems to mean something very like &quot;socialist&quot; or at least 
<br>
&quot;philosophical egalitarian&quot;. Of course, the American &quot;liberals&quot; doubtless 
<br>
claim to be the true heirs and successors of the Enlightenment.
<br>
<p>Nor do I mean the Australian sense of &quot;Liberal&quot;, which is damn close to 
<br>
&quot;social conservative&quot;.
<br>
<p>I'd say that people from the classical liberal tradition come in all shapes 
<br>
and sizes in their preparedness to raise and spend taxes. When I think of 
<br>
&quot;libertarians&quot; I have in mind positions which effectively state that 
<br>
taxation is theft. I don't rule out that idea but I want to bracket it off 
<br>
from most of what I'm doing.
<br>
<p>I'm happy to talk about this a bit further but I really don't want to spend 
<br>
a lot of time on this thread. However much I might be interested in 
<br>
designing a libertarian utopia, my much higher priority at the moment is 
<br>
working out how to disseminate the longevity meme and win the campaign 
<br>
against the luddites.
<br>
