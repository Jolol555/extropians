<em>&gt; &gt; Except to say, that if any of you so-called classical liberals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (sometimes this translates to libertarian - is this correct?) can give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me your scenario of how you would have solved the segregation problem in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the South during the 1950s and 1960s (or earlier, dare one hope?), I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; eat my ACLU membership card.
</em><br>
<p>Pat Fallon replied:
<br>
<em>&gt; One of the most famous segregation problems was telling Blacks to move to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the back of the bus.  IIRC, that was a municipal bus company, or one
</em><br>
granted
<br>
<em>&gt; a monopoly by the state.
</em><br>
<p>There were a myriad of segregation problems - theaters, restaurants,
<br>
schools, drinking fountains, etc. were segregated (can you imagine being a
<br>
black child - and the horror of growing up in a society like that?);
<br>
lynching &quot;happened&quot; sometimes; so called anti-miscegenation laws existed in
<br>
many states; there were no voting &quot;rights.&quot;  Even if the problem of  sitting
<br>
at the &quot;back-of-the-bus&quot; tradition got solved (the way I see it from the
<br>
libertarian perspective - and forgive me if I'm not up on all the
<br>
libertarian perspectives, I'm on a steep learning curve here - blacks would
<br>
then have been free to set up their own bus businesses, and there would have
<br>
been more busses in general (without the monopoly); and (lo-and-behold!) the
<br>
problem of sitting at the back of the busses would indeed have been banished
<br>
forever because blacks would then have had their own busses in which to sit,
<br>
as well as whites).  Therefore, I think better and more &quot;improved&quot;
<br>
segregation would have happened as a result - not less segregation
<br>
(unacceptable to begin with).
<br>
<p>Libertarians don't favor
<br>
<em>&gt; outlawing stupidity, but stupidity should have its costs.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not in favor of outlawing stupidity, either - only de jure
<br>
discrimination (legal bigotry).  Laws can't stop people from bigots if they
<br>
choose, but laws can hold schools, certain businesses, etc. accountable, so
<br>
that bigotry can at least be held in check as much as possible.  Bigotry
<br>
should have its costs.
<br>
<p>Thanks for your comments,
<br>
Olga
