Mike Lorrey has written another terrific essay, this time
<br>
on the causes of the statistical difference between men's
<br>
and women's attitudes.  What he's written is entirely 
<br>
consistent with recent sociological findings, e.g., see
<br>
Francis Fukiyama's book &quot;Trust&quot;, or Joel Kotkin's book
<br>
&quot;Tribes&quot;, which analyze many different societies.
<br>
<p>Mike wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think though, that it would behoove us to look at why exactly women
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to have a greater preference for security over freedom. I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept blindly the assertion that it is genetic. If it is not, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protocols can be fashioned to help mitigate such phenomena.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; High freedom societies that are stable and relatively immune or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resistant to fascist takeover seems to be exclusively the realm of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are constructed on a basis of high trust between individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside the family unit. The US government was constructed in such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society (NOTE: High trust between individuals has nothing to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trust in government. The founding fathers trusted each other with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reins of government, but not the instruments of government per se) of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; white males who knew each other, and trusted those they didn't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they were also educated white males (i.e. recognized members of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the leadership class). Many of these white males were of the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious denomination, were Masons, and had attended the same colleges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and been members of the same state legislatures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this society, women and blacks were not trusted with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibilities of citizenship, they were seen as less than capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bearing the 'white man's burden', and female blacks were considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least capable of all. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When later on first blacks, then women, were enfranchised as full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens, there were significant movements who continued to oppose this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either officially, unofficially, or systemically, which demonstrated to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the newly enfranchised groups that they were still not fully trusted for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons they had absolutely no control over, they had no hope of ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earning through merit the trust of a full citizen with a large amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the white male populace, and that through that lack of trust, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learned that the words that white men spoke in the open were not to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trusted, because they could not be depended upon to follow through on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their lofty pronouncements of equal rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At the same time, the country was in desperate need of labor to build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the expansionist dreams of its leaders, westward into the frontier, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward with technology and infrastructure, such that immigration from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-Anglo countries vastly increased, and the lack of trust inherent in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these non-Anglo cultures resisted the forces of assimilation, thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diluting further the sum of trust between all individuals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a result, it is not surprising that women, being the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enfranchised group, is the least trusting toward others, even between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves, to the point that studies show that all groups: black males,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black females, and white females all demonstrate greater trust for white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; males than for members of their own group, and that these groups all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend toward reliance on legal measures that prefer security to freedom.
