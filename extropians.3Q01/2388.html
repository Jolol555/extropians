</em><br>
<em>&gt; (hardest of all) how the impending MNT and Singularity affect the second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this posting, I will address (i) only.  My model of a new country is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the United States, partly because I know more about it than I do about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the origins of other nations, but partly because by the time that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; officially begun, there existed extremely good traditions of liberty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-reliance, prosperity, and productivity.  It was no coincidence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these things arose together.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe it is simply to be taken for granted that you
<br>
can apply the start of the United States over two hundred years
<br>
ago in that much simpler environment to any country &quot;starting
<br>
out&quot; now.  Almost all of the starting conditions are different.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't know for sure at what moment in U.S. history any government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; began extracting money from its citizens solely to benefit other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens, but it may have been 1913 with the enactment of the Federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Income Tax.  (Still, I don't know when government charity really began.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it was a terrible mistake, which, despite its good intentions, has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harmed the lives of millions of people.  For every person genuinely
</em><br>
<p>I thought this was to be a more balanced analysis but it looks
<br>
like the same opinions being expressed again while again not
<br>
addressing the questions I and others have asked.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; benefitted---whose life was saved or whose health was restored---there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were untold thousands who delayed or postponed permanently the making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of life-changing difficult decisions.  This is certainly not to 
</em><br>
<p>This is an assertion without proof as serveral of the above
<br>
statements also were.
<br>
<p>suggest
<br>
<em>&gt; that Chicago or New York in 1880 was free of crime, drugs, and people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in seemingly hopeless situations.  (But then, there have never been large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cities without these problems, whether it's Cairo today or Rome in 100AD.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But there was no institutionalized underclass, not even in Appalachia,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a place where people couldn't leave unfair and frightful situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainly because of their traditions and their fatalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You don't seem to know much about Appalachia.  Several
<br>
generations of my family were from Appalachia.  They didn't stay
<br>
out of traditions and fatalism.  They stayed largely because
<br>
they were dirt poor, uneducated and massively exploited as cheap
<br>
labor in the mines and mining towns of those earlier times.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The Los Angeles police force may be a good place start to describe some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the alternatives available to cities in the early years of this century.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In one way, vigilantism is a patent disregard of lawful procedures, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in another way it exemplifies community spirit.  Vigilantism arises when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common citizens---who have to be relatively few in number compared to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the anonymity that afflicts modern cities---act not out of self-interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but out of a sincere desire to make their community a better place, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that means, to them, taking the law into their own hands.  We commonly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approve, instead, of these same citizens (of communities where, as I say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people have identities) being deputized under the auspices of a legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establishment that promises a quick and speedy justice, but justice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonetheless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Uh, I think you are massively adrift here.  What was the subject
<br>
you started out to address?  Are you advocating vigilantism as a
<br>
marker of better times and part of a solution to the questions
<br>
asked?  I am very confused and troubled by this aside.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The Los Angeles police force was moved, according to a television
</em><br>
<em>&gt; documentary I saw, by what was evidently this same spirit (which isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too surprising knowing what else they're wont to do).  In the 1930's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 40's they faced an imminent invasion by the Mafia, which had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already firmly established itself in dozens of eastern cities.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; L.A. police would get word that some mobster was going to fly in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and meet him at the airport.  Sometimes they'd just grab him and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put him on the next plane back to New York, &quot;thus violating his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civil rights&quot;, I suppose.  At other times, they'd simply trail a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known mobster on the road, and literally pull him over every two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blocks to demand identification and hassle him in other ways.  As a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result the Mafia didn't get established in L.A. until just recently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you know how the L.A. police used to handle homelessness?  They'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take a bum, or other loiterer or vagrant, give him something to eat,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then drive him to the city limits (which is pretty far away in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; L.A.) and just dump him out.  Until recently, L.A. didn't have much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a homeless problem; many of the same people, I imagine, went to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; San Francisco.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK.  Obviously you have zip understanding of the question asked
<br>
and no intention of stepping outside your pat habitual
<br>
thoughts.  Later...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; As cruel as it sounds at first, as uncaring as it appears (and is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually), this is the best solution.  Sooner or later, except in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few cases, the drifter will drift into some small town, and get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an extremely low paying job, merely because all his alternatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are worse.  (Naturally, today such an option isn't available because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the minimum wage laws, and the fact that today's vagrants have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been tolerated for so long, that the reform of any particular one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them is highly unlikely.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But all this is what should have been done.  I'm afraid that unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truly Orwellian techniques are used, thousands and thousands of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today are rather hopelessly wedded to lives of zero economic utility,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drug dependency, and crime.  (Yes, many thousands aren't, and many may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn their lives around.)  I'll say more about what I think our options
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today are in another post, and then start guessing (like everyone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is) about the future.
</em><br>
<p><p>I hope you enjoy your &quot;solution&quot; when it is yourself who no
<br>
longer has a viable economic utility in a competitive market.
