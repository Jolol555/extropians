<p>I can personally testify that it is non-zero, from my academic
<br>
experience and degrees if nothing else.  The particular implementations
<br>
I desire to pursue at this time require significant funding, though.  I
<br>
am attempting to gather said funding, and map out what to do with said
<br>
funding (which, in itself, helps to gather said funding), but it is
<br>
taking a while.
<br>
<p>(Specifically: I wish to develop them through a business, so as to make
<br>
them commercially available.  The usual funding source for this,
<br>
venture capital, is difficult to obtain because the nature of these
<br>
technologies is &quot;unproven&quot;, especially &quot;unknown market&quot;, but more
<br>
importantly there can be no sales without product.  Thus, product
<br>
development must proceed under extremely limited funding...but how does
<br>
one, for example, do &quot;cheap&quot; - under $10K/year - cybernetics or
<br>
rocketry that yield any useful data for developing a production model?
<br>
Using the money to get more money instead seems to be the only viable
<br>
option at this stage...)
