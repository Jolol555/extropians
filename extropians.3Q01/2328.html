<p>It is pretty simple. Adobe used broken (it's hard to call ROT13 even
<br>
broken) crypto in their product. Sklyarov (who apart from having a wife
<br>
and two small children also seems to be a spammer, but that's also
<br>
irrelevant for the case)  wrote a commercial package circumventing it.
<br>
<p>On Adobe's bidding using DMCA as legal background FBI arrested him after
<br>
his talk at Defcon where he presented his findings. He was not allowed to
<br>
speak to his consul and was essentially held incommunicado. Which is
<br>
pretty strong-arm intimidation in my book.
<br>
<p>Geeks went postal, Adobe superficially caved in (but hasn't publicly
<br>
denounced DMCA, quite the opposite), Sklyarov is still held because the
<br>
particular legal machinery cannot be terminated once invoked. Of course
<br>
Adobe's lawyers knew that in advance.
<br>
<p>So Adobe lost major brownie points far and wide in geekdom, DMCA is still
<br>
standing strong (put at least there's some political rustling around the
<br>
bushes), Dmitry is still in jail, security conferences outside of U.S.
<br>
will become even more interesting (from what I hear Defcon was pretty
<br>
lame, anyway), and anonymous publishing packages (while still allowing nym
<br>
prestige building) are receiving another major boost.
<br>
<p>It will be interesting to see how cryptography/steganography will fare
<br>
against men with suits and guns. It's clear that while you can't link
<br>
prestige accrued on a nym to meatspace, you can still publish papers and
<br>
code without fear of being traced back (unless you're running software
<br>
from Redmond, of course).
