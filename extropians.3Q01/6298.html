<em>&gt; My reply to your post...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Bomb their entire countries dust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...is a companion to my reply to Miriam's, so read both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before you reply to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me (if you can be bothered replying at all).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I absolutely understand your reaction. I find myself having similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fantasies... and I'm not even American. I feel that it was an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack on all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of us. I can't convey how deeply sickened I was at those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; images of people in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Middle East celebrating (no matter how much I try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand it),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; juxtaposed against all the other terrible images that I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so seen over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and over for the past 24 hours - not least of it those people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deliberating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jumping to their deaths, caught in stop-motion as they plunge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; headfirst down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sides of the towers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can't really bomb those entire countries to dust, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend, but just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this once I won't argue with you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Re another post of yours: yes, build the thing even higher.

</em><br>
<p>This is a long one, so if your pressed for time, I suggest hitting delete
<br>
right now. Sorry, but this got me cranked up, and if this doent crank you
<br>
up, then you dont have a pulse.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those countries responsible for this should be held fully accountable.
<br>
There is no way you can make the claim that a group of people are guilty,
<br>
while they are being hidden, funded, and aided by some system of government,
<br>
and then say the government isn’t just as responsible. Those governments,
<br>
being responsible for making this possible are also morally responsible for
<br>
paying for damages (There is no way to put a price on the lives lost, but at
<br>
the very least, they should pay the millions or billions due in property
<br>
damage due the owners of the property). The only big asset that I’m aware
<br>
that the Middle East has in abundance is oil, so be it, they can pay in
<br>
whatever means they have. Obviously, this doesn’t fix the situation, but it
<br>
can be used to compensate those involved. What about the mothers that were
<br>
counting on the income of the fathers killed? What do they do now? Also they
<br>
are responsible for bringing these terrorists to justice; failure to do so
<br>
in a reasonable amount of time indicates their support, aid, and implicit
<br>
consent. By reasonable, I mean as quickly as they can lay their hands on
<br>
them. Failure to meet all of these minimal demands would be insufficient and
<br>
would simply be their attempt to “compromise” on basic principles of
<br>
fairness. Also, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to demand these simple
<br>
things. I point our rebuilding of most countries that we have had wars with
<br>
(even though most in fact deserved it), as historical precedence that this
<br>
is more then fair.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large percentage of the adults in those countries support their system of
<br>
government. They too are morally responsible if they support a system that
<br>
deals out wholesale slaughter to innocent civilians. They have means
<br>
available to them to both escape and help support the effort to change their
<br>
system. I’ve never heard of border patrols keeping people from moving as
<br>
they wish, although even if there was such a system, I cant imagine them
<br>
having the resources to fully protect their borders when even we cant pull
<br>
that off. Finally, those systems support the oppression of their own
<br>
peoples, specifically the women and non-Muslims have no moral appeal on why
<br>
they should even exist while subjecting such atrocities on their own people.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the children they are not responsible, but still dangerous.
<br>
Unfortunately, we learned this lesson many times before. We’ve all heard
<br>
about the Vietnamese children, trained to kill or those that had bombs
<br>
strapped on them that walked into G.I. camps. We saw on television these
<br>
children being trained to fight the Great Russian enemy from the north with
<br>
their AK-47s, grenade launchers, and stinger missiles (amazing supplied from
<br>
the US!). Also note, these children are NOT going to grow up to be great
<br>
lovers of peace in an atmosphere that they presently inhabit. They will be
<br>
the very ones over here dropping nerve gas, killing your children. Remember
<br>
then, that now we had a chance to stop them, but you stepped in and
<br>
prevented it. Who will we blame then?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a war of ideas, capitalism and reason vs. religion and
<br>
irrationalism. One side or the other will take the aggressive stance and try
<br>
to suppress the other. If someone was breaking in your house, and attacking
<br>
your children, you wouldn’t have any problem killing to defend it. You
<br>
wouldn’t be worried about missing the shot, sending a stray bullet, all you
<br>
would care about is to prevent that monster from raping your children, all
<br>
you will care about is making it stop. No one likes using violence, but
<br>
sometimes, there IS a call for it. This is one of those times. Failure to
<br>
act against evil when given the chance does you, your children, or your
<br>
country no service. No body in any war actually enjoyed it, but they had the
<br>
courage to fight when the time calls. In Vietnam, there were questions about
<br>
the morality of the war; there is no such questions here.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what to do? Try and protect the country while targeting individuals?
<br>
Those countries will keep cranking out the terrorists. Give up and do
<br>
nothing but cower in fear? Oddly enough, I suspect enough moral cowardice
<br>
and insecurity that this might be an option to some. The only surefire
<br>
rational method of ensuring they don’t have the capability to support
<br>
terrorists is to remove the system in power. That isn’t easy. Matter of fact
<br>
it’s bloody as hell, but this is the only guarantee you’ll get in protecting
<br>
liberty. Its us or them. For those of you who think the cost is too high, I
<br>
suggest you read up on history and try to grasp the full magnitude of the
<br>
abominable nature of serfdom and its effect on the human spirit…
<br>
