<p>Believers often render unbelievers (real people) to the status of
<br>
&quot;invisible,&quot; all the while lending reality to the &quot;invisible.&quot;  Don't ask.
<br>
Nontheists do not HAVE to make &quot;enemies&quot; of believers - this is, after all,
<br>
a pluralistic society.  And believers need to &quot;understand&quot; that just as
<br>
there are Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, etc., there are nontheists in their
<br>
midst, too.  Believers also need to understand that we do not just have
<br>
freedom of religion, but freedom from religion, as well.  Was it Clinton(?)
<br>
who not too long ago came up with the brilliant quote along the lines of,
<br>
&quot;Just because we have freedom of religion doesn't mean we have freedom from
<br>
religion?&quot;   Sheeesh.
<br>
<p>Nontheists need to come out of the closet.  That way, I won't have to face
<br>
GROWN people telling me, &quot;Wow, I've never met an atheist before,&quot; or  &quot;Gee,
<br>
but you're too nice to be an atheist.&quot;  On a more serious note, it may may
<br>
help our society get up to scientific speed, as well, to have a more vocal
<br>
nontheistic presence (although this may be difficult to calculate)  Think
<br>
about all the good potential scientists and rational thinkers among the
<br>
young - and think about how many of them are lost to us forever because they
<br>
just can't see through the thick fog of religiosity.  Certainly, some kids
<br>
find their way out.  But why make it so difficult, by giving the &quot;default&quot;
<br>
position to the religious viewpoint?  Children need more nontheistic &quot;role
<br>
models.&quot;
