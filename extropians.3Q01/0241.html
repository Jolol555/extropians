<p>Sure, but how many years is that fiber good for? 10? 20? Figure how many
<br>
years of Moore's Law-like doubling of bandwidth/utility demands maxes
<br>
out the capacity of the fiber. Take that many years, divide it by 100 to
<br>
get your discount rate. Subtract inflaction from the discount rate for
<br>
your adjusted discount rate. Divide the cost by the years and then
<br>
discount each year by the adjusted discount rate amortizing the previous
<br>
years fraction.
<br>
<p>I freaked out the upper management at Dartmouth College a few years ago
<br>
when I was helping to install their new campus wide 100 base t network.
<br>
I was installing the hookups in the President's office and chatting with
<br>
his secretary, when I casually mentioned,&quot;Yeah, you guys won't have to
<br>
replace this system for about 10 years.&quot; which freaked her out.
<br>
&quot;This is supposed to be good for 20 years,&quot; she said.
<br>
&quot;Nah, you gotta account for Moore's law, see, where bandwidth doubles
<br>
every year and a half. Right now you guys have a 1 mb/sec network that's
<br>
maxed out. Double that every year and a half, and in 10 years you are at
<br>
100 mb/sec which is this new systems maximum capacity.&quot; Apparently my
<br>
employer had not either accounted for this doubling, or else had not
<br>
told the College (and apparently the college either wasn't aware of it,
<br>
or those who were aware of it were keeping their mouths shut, expecting
<br>
such info to not get out until the network was bought and installed....)
