</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are we talking major technology breakthrough that throws a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forcefield around the entire state?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) NH's state constitution retains the right to secede, and has since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before it became the 9th and ratifying signor of the US Constitution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Sure, sure.  But we saw what happened the last time any states
<br>
attempted that.  I have little reason to believe the response
<br>
today would be less extreme.  Particularly if the new
<br>
state/country is set up with laws quite different than the US. 
<br>
I can imagine the excuses for the US to respond militarily.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; b) What makes you think a defense is needed beyond the existing state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Air Guard units?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I doubt the existing Air Guard would be sufficient against the
<br>
combined military of the rest of the US.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; c) YOU can barely get 20 people to agree with your cynicism, but you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't seem to be aware that the Free State Project has been done before.
</em><br>
<p>It is not cynicism at all.  It is despair of any such scheme
<br>
being workable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fellow who started the current incarnation is a Yale person who has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dug up evidence that there was a similar organization in the early 70's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at Yale whose purpose was to flood a small state with left wingers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tip its political balance. The state they chose was Vermont, and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did get the numbers they wanted to move there, and look at the result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today: socialized medicine, gay marriage, anti-logging laws, and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confiscatory state education finance law, as well as anti-growth laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a ban on BGH in the state.
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me but there is not a damn thing wrong with gay
<br>
marriage.  There is something wrong with bigots telling me that
<br>
my desire to marry the partner of my choice is wrong or a matter
<br>
of the moral or political decadence.
