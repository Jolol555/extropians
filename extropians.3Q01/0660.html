<em>&gt;From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Debunk%20All%20Religiosity%20Equally%20(D.A.R.E.)&In-Reply-To=&lt;F159z2Mb1s7nlT2NqFJ00012263@hotmail.com&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;Suppose churchgoers did live longer.  So what?
</em><br>
<p>Well that would necessarily mean that God is on their side.  Which in turn 
<br>
would mean that God exists and, therefore, that these are the &quot;last days&quot; 
<br>
and that Jesus is coming back soon to take all the Christians away to leave 
<br>
the rest of us to toil under the despotism of the Anti-Christ and the 
<br>
ungodly plagues and other suffering which will accompany 1000 years of 
<br>
&quot;tribulation&quot; before Christ comes back again to make everything OK again 
<br>
(but only for the Christians).  The rest of us get a one-way ticket to 
<br>
H-E-double toothpicks.
<br>
<p>Oh, and as for your Singularity thing?  You can forget about it.  There's 
<br>
not a word of it in the book of Revelations which clearly details all the 
<br>
important developments in the future.
<br>
<p>My advice: forget about life extension, artificial intelligence or any 
<br>
optimism whatsoever about the future.  Go to church now and pray that God 
<br>
has mercy on your heathen soul before it's too late!
<br>
<p>(While my tongue was firmly planted in cheek, the above is not a joke.  Many 
<br>
&quot;Christians&quot; believe it to be the gospel truth.  My question is does 
<br>
religion even need debunking?  Seems that theism is its own best debunker.)
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>Life is good.  Refuse to die.
