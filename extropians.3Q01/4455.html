From: Miriam English
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hopefully, one day people will see that having an underclass is dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the upper classes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I see it, this is one of the best arguments for welfare and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms for redistribution of wealth. If the rich are supremely wealthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the poor are without hope then what have the poor to lose by attacking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rich? I am not saying it is right or proper, just that it must be seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be a real danger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Helping the poverty-stricken to have a chance at a good and comfortable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future is not just good for the poor, but good insurance for the rich.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arming yourself is not the solution -- you just live in a well decorated
</em><br>
cage.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cheers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;          - Miriam
</em><br>
<p>And cheers TO Miriam!   What a humane perspective.
<br>
<p>I personally don't understand the trust libertarians in general seem to put
<br>
on &quot;the individual.&quot;  I don't recall reading of any time in our history
<br>
(U.S. history) when libertarianism was supposedly in bloom, and when peace,
<br>
prosperity and goodwill reigned.  If there was such a time (a better time
<br>
for citizens in the U.S., compared to recent years), I'd like to know when
<br>
that time was.
<br>
<p>My dear husband and I were recently talking, and something he said really
<br>
caught my attention.  He speculated that if past failures of statist
<br>
economies can often be attributed to mismanagement of faulty data, then with
<br>
the advent of advances such as artificial intelligence, comprehensive
<br>
economic data on both macro- and micro- levels, as well as more refined
<br>
modeling and forecasting techniques, there is no reason why centrally
<br>
controlled economies may not turn out to be the more effective system, after
<br>
all, in the future.
