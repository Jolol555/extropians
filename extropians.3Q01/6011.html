I dunno.  I have included the original message I responded to
<br>
below. Perhaps it is a language or cultural thing but it was
<br>
written in very directly personal terms as far as I could tell. 
<br>
Of course you could be using &quot;your&quot; in the group sense but that
<br>
is not the way I would first take it.
<br>
<p>But beyond that little misunderstanding, I think the thoughts on
<br>
both sides are important to delve into a bit.  Your advice seems
<br>
to be that we should not get involved at all in politics or in
<br>
protesting disasterous policies before they become law but
<br>
rather go found a new state/country/colony somehow. 
<br>
<p>But my response is that this is very longterm work and difficult
<br>
to carry off in this world.  Doing so is far more likely to
<br>
distract us for quite some years from the work of transforming
<br>
ourselves and humanity.  And that path of separation is fraught
<br>
with considerable danger.  Perhaps much more so than fighting
<br>
the darkness where each of is now or where we choose to be among
<br>
the existing states.

<br>
<p>Again, I must bring to your attention that we can consider
<br>
setting up an independent colony to
<br>
get out of this mess. This does not mean escapism, but that we
<br>
must recognise that a lot of
<br>
people refuse to lead a liftstyle that we belive they should and
<br>
could (i.e. maximising their own
<br>
freedom). We can set up a colony and both groups (i.e. ourselves
<br>
and the rest who choose to
<br>
refuse) live life as all of us prefer.
<br>
<p>Refusal to recognize this fact would only bring disaster to all
<br>
your efforts to prevent the loss of
<br>
your freedoms. Violence and clashes calculated to reduce the
<br>
influence of your Governments, of
<br>
insufficient people, would only lead to busy emergency rooms and
<br>
more business for the
<br>
undertakers. It would probably lead to the loss of your
<br>
individual freedom too, as in enjoying
<br>
free lodging from your Governments.
<br>
<p>Attempts to mail bomb will only classify yourself as a malicious
<br>
&quot;hacker&quot; intent on creating a
<br>
Denial-of-Service (DOS) attack on Government servers (as what
<br>
the Singapore Government had
<br>
done for an unrelated case). Even if your mails get through,
<br>
they would only experience
<br>
censorship from the human operators who get to press the delete
<br>
key constantly.
<br>
<p>Think carefully about your actions and consequences.
