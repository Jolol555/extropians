<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Occasionally people ask if I want to upload when it becomes possible, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the answer is no.  I want to enhance my mentality, but I don't want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; climb simulated mountains, I want to climb the real rocks, eroding, subject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to unpredictable weather, and requiring great effort to reach in some cases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; See this is what I was talking about when I reviewed the Final Fantasy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; movie. Many people when you talk about living in a computer/simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have this idea that it will be some kind of cheesy unrealistic sim. When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in actuality it can be just as real as the &quot;real world&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't claim it will be any less &quot;realistic&quot; than reality.  By the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people (or at least I) will be willing to move in, the resolution will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as good as you want.  But someone will  have to have made a choice about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which moment in the lifetime of the rock to recreate, and at what rate to
</em><br>
<p>That &quot;someone&quot; will be you. And you can, if you want, climb a simulated
<br>
mountain that is an exact, down to every little micro-crack, copy of a
<br>
current mountain on the real Earth in realtime. In other words you can
<br>
import the real world in its current state into your VR, no problemo.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; let it erode, if at all.  Different people will climb different mountains,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and few of them will choose to climb with potentially fatal consequences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enabled.  It will be a different sport.  I also climb at an indoor climbing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gym.  It's a different sport.
</em><br>
<p>Again, you can climb this perfect virtual replica of realtime Mt. Everest
<br>
in an exact replica of your pre-upload body (or whatever) set to really
<br>
truly kill you if you fall. You can even do it with no backups of yourself
<br>
if you really want to. It's all going to be up to you. Other people can
<br>
climb with you, in fact perhaps there will spring up some kind of &quot;real
<br>
world rockclimbing&quot; league of people who are into climbing only realtime
<br>
replicas of Earth objects. Whatever blows your hair back...
<br>
<p>The point I guess is that upload civilization is really a /superset/ of
<br>
&quot;real&quot; civilization. It can contain a complete copy of the real world,
<br>
in fact I think this is very likely. Or you can still transfer your
<br>
mind into some kind of robot body which might look and feel exactly like
<br>
an old-school human if you want to physically move around in the origin
<br>
world. Or you can create brand new worlds either designed by yourself
<br>
or randomly evolved and eroded. etc. etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; BTW, you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; realize you may be already living in a sim right now?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I realize that it's possible that that is how this reality is implemented.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At this point, I don't see any reason to lend more credence to that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis than to the one that suggests that there's an omnipotent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; omniscient being who doesn't interfere in our affairs very often.
</em><br>
<p>You might want to ask Nick Bostrom about that... he seems to find
<br>
evidence supporting the life-in-sim conclusion. If you found out you
<br>
were living in a sim, would that bother you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I should probably mention, in the context of recent discussions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; filtering that I run my filters differently than most.  I have the list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turned off, except for authors whose writings I've chosen to read.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occasionally see a new name quoted in other people's replies, and decide I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to add that name to the list of people whose messages I see.  Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name wasn't on my list before, so I only saw your message in Mike Lorrey's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reply.  I will add your name to my list.  If there was more to your message
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the paragraph I quoted above, I'd appreciate it if you'd resend it.
</em><br>
<p>Nope that was it.
