I notice I said
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; _Quadrant_ has just accepted my latest rejoinder to Margaret
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Somerville in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; record time. It'll be published in the August issue.
</em><br>
<p>Er, I meant September. I was astonished when I posted the thing off in hard 
<br>
copy from Melbourne to Sydney on Sunday and received an enthusiastic email 
<br>
from editor Paddy McGuinness on Wednesday (for a piece 4000 words long; 
<br>
that's *quick*). Thanks to Reason, Mark and Damien who commented on it in 
<br>
draft form and to Anders and Eliezer for some other useful comments.
<br>
<p>Reason said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The theocratization of the US can be seen as an illustration of why
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-repressive societies become repressive societies: give people freedom,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and that includes the group which wants to use that freedom to set up a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;repressive society. How do you defend against that without becoming a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;repressive society? You don't. It's the paradox of libertarianism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anarchism -- neither can really exist in practice. To defend a libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or anarchist society from determined people and organizations who want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bring about another form of society/govenment requires that the libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or anarchist society organise and become non-libertarian/non-anarchist.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I think you can put a powerful argument that it is not the role of 
<br>
government or the law to impose a moral/theological/metaphysical consensus. 
<br>
And you can make this argument to people who are not, in any strong sense, 
<br>
libertarians.
<br>
