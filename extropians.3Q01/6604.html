</em><br>
<p>This is ludicrous.  Extropians are believers in TRUTH.  Yet every time we
<br>
have any sort of threat to our ideals, many people on this list start
<br>
inventing all sorts of subterfuge and lies.  The archives are full of ideas
<br>
on infiltrating groups, committing crimes and blaming them on someone else,
<br>
issuing false statements attributed to someone else, starting false rumors,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>Using false statistics, false stories, and false methods is unacceptable.
<br>
We do not need to invent reasons to oppose these atrocities.  We do not need
<br>
to lie to people to convert them to the truth.  We do not need to trick
<br>
people into accepting our views.  We do not need to falsify evidence to make
<br>
our enemies appear guilty.
<br>
<p>Anyone who stoops to these anti-Extropian activities is a False Extropian.
<br>
Such a person claims that truth, science and logic are the best policy,
<br>
while they secretly resort to deceit, propaganda and cheating to try to
<br>
further their cause.  Such people must actually doubt that the Extropian
<br>
Principals will lead to the greater good, and they actually believe that our
<br>
enemies' methods are a superior path to victory.  Such people and activities
<br>
are actually working against Extropian ideas and are promoting un-Extropian
<br>
activities.
<br>
<p>I do not want to see these kinds of activities identified with the Extropian
<br>
movement.  As an amusing comment or intellectual exercise, these ideas are
<br>
interesting to develop.  But let's be clear:  Spreading lies, rumors, false
<br>
documents, false pictures, false statistics and trickery is NOT an Extropian
<br>
activity.  Even when furthering &quot;our&quot; goals over &quot;their&quot; goals, these are
<br>
not part of any Extropian methodology.
