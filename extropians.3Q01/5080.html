<em>&gt; &gt; *What* inalienable right to procreate?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Good question. In the US, a man was recently ordered by a court of law not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;father any more children.
</em><br>
<p>I hate to even discuss Constitutionally inalienable rights because of the 
<br>
tendency it has to compel certain folks to fly into a &quot;gun rights&quot; frenzy.  
<br>
But I will say this: if a right is only inalienable if it cannot be legally 
<br>
abridged under any circumstance, then there is no such beast.  After all, I 
<br>
think *everyone* would agree that there exists an inalienable right to life. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too long ago one Timothy McVeigh had his right to life, well, severely 
<br>
abridged.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
