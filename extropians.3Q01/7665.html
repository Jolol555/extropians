Samantha Atkins a écrit (28.9.2001/01:32) :
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The idea that you (the US) are somehow responsible for these attacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has some popularity here in France. But on this instance, it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seem true. The islamists just want to impose their world order,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; according to their sense of justice. It has little to do with wrongs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you would have done according to YOUR sense of justice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm.  Saying &quot;the islamists&quot; above implies all Islamic people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this.
</em><br>
<p><p>No, of course not. I was using the word &quot;islamist&quot; as opposed to
<br>
&quot;islamic&quot;. You can be muslim/islamic (beliefs, personal life) without
<br>
being islamist (want society to be ruled by islam). You can also be
<br>
islamist without being imperialist (want all world to be thus ruled,
<br>
not just your society). And you can even be imperialist without being
<br>
violent (using persuasion for example). Anyway, I'm talking about the
<br>
few islamist-imperialist-violent muslims who do that sort of things.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Wanting in general to produce such a world by itself would not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focus the energy on America in particular necessarily.  
</em><br>
<p><p>First, is it not focused on America only, but also Israel, and all
<br>
Europe. For example, in december 1994, a plane was hijacked by an
<br>
islamist commando, they killed two people then landed in south of
<br>
France and demanded a complete refill of fuel. Fortunately French
<br>
special police units managed to stop this. We now know that the plane
<br>
was planned to crash itself on the center of Paris.
<br>
<p>Second, there are 4 main reasons for which the US are aimed : support
<br>
for Israel, presence in Saudi (sacred home land of islam), general
<br>
world domination, and cultural influence.
<br>
<p>Basically, you can't help on any of these points. In particular, world
<br>
domination will be more and more necessary, as more destructive
<br>
weapons get available (for the long term, see Drexler for example) and
<br>
will imply things like presence in Saudi and support for Israel.
<br>
Cultural influence seems inevitable, too, disrupting their society,
<br>
and giving women for example &quot;absurd and dangerous&quot; ideas.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; A French editorialist (Serge July) ended an article recently saying :
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;we should remember that the only real solution to terrorism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; justice&quot;. This is an illusion : you just cannot imagine that, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world being fair according to your sense of justice, a large group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people could want to kill you ; but as a matter of fact, that's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the way it is. According to their sense of justice, your very life is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an offense to the Creator. They hate you. Not for what you have done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to them ; for your (lack of) beliefs, for your way of living, for your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Infidelity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such hatred is not compatible with much of most religious belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems or their literature.  It is practiced by some subset of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious groups.  It is quite questionable even within their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion.  Such questioning by other members of their religion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of differening opinions is probably one of the fastest peaceful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways to diffuse such &quot;religious&quot; hatred.
</em><br>
<p><p>That may well be, but I'm not sure how we make this happen.
<br>
<p>ANd you should not dismiss too easily that there is something in islam
<br>
that makes it produce with regularity this tiny minority of terrorists.
<br>
<p>For example, in Christianism, force is not well regarded. It is in
<br>
islam. In Christianism, you should love even your ennemy. Not in
<br>
islam.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; The word &quot;valid&quot; is the problem. Their claims (like having Jews out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Palestine, and having US out of Saoudi, and finally extending islam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over the planet) are valid according to them, but not according to you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (well, to me at least). As this translates in attacks on you, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cannot afford so much tolerance as to treat them as &quot;valid&quot;, even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are valid in some sense (= they are consistant with their sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of justice).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even without these very questionable things there are many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims that are perfectly valid where we did in fact act in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slimey and underhanded fashion.  We can at least address those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honestly.
</em><br>
<p><p>You sure can and should. But be prepared that it won't solve the
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p>And if these very points were done for opportunistic reasons, as a way
<br>
of protecting your control and domination, then &quot;correcting&quot; them
<br>
might make things even worse.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Of course this is a bit of a constraint. But I think it is quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understandable. The US have been hurt, they seek back up. It doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seem very responsible from us (France) to decline it -- and then ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more support from you when things go worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure but this is not the point. France should not support US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policies and actions on this blindly any more than Americans should.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Freedom includes the right to freely question and to disagree. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't make you or your country complicit in terrorism if you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think this is not a yes/no problem. Imagine that your friend is
<br>
badly hurt, and asks help from you to counter. Depending on the kind
<br>
of help she asks, what really happened, what might happen next, who is
<br>
the attacker, etc., you will have a tension between various desires
<br>
and fears. It's a matter of nuance and quantity, and to make the right
<br>
choice you need to limitate the amount of blindness and cowardness that
<br>
you put in the resolution of the problem.
<br>
<p><p>Jacques
