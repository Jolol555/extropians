<em>&gt; &gt; Uh, I'm not sure I understand. However, I think there's more to the cop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dynamic here. From some article relating to the local PG police my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; impression was that black police officers  become cops first and black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; second, and that displays of racism against other blacks serves to meld
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them into the police force and make them more acceptable to fellow white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; officers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's the claim, allegedly supported by black officers saying &quot;I ain't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your brother&quot; to black criminals trying the 'yo brother' routine.
</em><br>
<p>This is 100% consistent with the &quot;thin blue line&quot;--it's not even about
<br>
the fellow officers being white, necessarily.
<br>
<p>It's about &quot;the position of 'brother' has already been filled, scumbag.&quot;
<br>
<p>This still easily leads to abuse under color of authority.
<br>
<p>But a cop who is seen as &quot;not sound&quot;, to borrow a phrase beloved by the 
<br>
British moneyed class, eventually finds himself waiting, in some benighted
<br>
call-turned-shitstorm, for backup that never arrives. Or the moral equivalent 
<br>
of same.
<br>
<p>There are, consequently, many cultural parallels between the guardians and
<br>
the gangs. See _Serpico_ and _Donnie Brasco_ as a double bill sometime.
