<p>
23 September 2001
<br>
<p>Is there still hope left?
<br>
<p>We as human beings and inhabitants of earth are faced with one of the 
<br>
greatest moments in human history. Our 
<br>
world is on the brink of cataclysmic change. Many known and unknown 
<br>
civilizations that have come before us 
<br>
have been at this moment in time. Perhaps forces deep with inside the 
<br>
earth such as volcanoes or earthquakes 
<br>
have triggered these events. Maybe these events came from the deepest 
<br>
reaches of outer space or even from 
<br>
disease or divine intervention. 
<br>
<p>Whatever the case as you read this, the human society in whole has the 
<br>
chance to choose it's own destiny. There 
<br>
have been some of the most horrific events in recent history that have 
<br>
occurred over the last year. From mothers 
<br>
killing their babies for no reason to the mass amounts of children
<br>
killing out 
<br>
of control. All of this culminating with 
<br>
the suicide attacks that have been occurring around the globe and the 
<br>
infamous WTC attack of 11 September 
<br>
2001. 
<br>
<p>Lets face some facts here:
<br>
<p>Iran has no less than 38 intermediate range nuclear missiles ready to
<br>
go.
<br>
India and Pakistan have full nuclear capabilities.
<br>
Israel is fully nuclear and willing to preempt any threat that they feel
<br>
is real.
<br>
Iraq.... What do you think?
<br>
And of course all the others.
<br>
<p>Lets not even talk about the biological and chemical weapons.. Anthrax
<br>
is 
<br>
always a favorite when people talk 
<br>
about bio weapons. The thing is that it is very difficult to deliver 
<br>
affectively. Not to say that it isn't a real threat 
<br>
especially on the defined battlefields. To other places in the world it
<br>
isn't 
<br>
affective unless it is delivered by 
<br>
someone like Russia or the USA who really has the means. God only 
<br>
hopes that Iraq can't deliver it yet via their 
<br>
SCUD Missile system. This would be a clear threat for Israel's
<br>
population. 
<br>
<p>The main threat is very realistic. SMALL POX. This deadly disease is 
<br>
extremely contagious and very resilient. 
<br>
Once it is out it doesn't just die and disappear. You are talking about
<br>
one 
<br>
infected person could cause a wildfire 
<br>
affect across a nation and the globe. This viscous disease will kill
<br>
within a 
<br>
week. The USA for example only has 
<br>
a total of 7 million vaccines available. And guess who they are for?? 
<br>
That's right the US military and the 
<br>
government officials. SMALLPOX escaped the controlled laboratories with 
<br>
the end of the Russian communist 
<br>
regime. Not to say it has infected anyone outside of their testing 
<br>
conditions; this is to say that the deadly disease 
<br>
is now in the hands of people who are not afraid to use it. If you
<br>
believe 
<br>
anything less than this, don't confuse 
<br>
ignorance with hope.
<br>
So this brings us back to choice. Yes it is our human obligation to
<br>
stand 
<br>
up to and overcome evil. This has been 
<br>
the eternal human struggle. Whether those evils came from within 
<br>
ourselves or from outside forces. The 
<br>
perspective of good and bad and right and wrong is always been subject 
<br>
to the way in which you view it. There 
<br>
have been times in our human history where good and the better for all 
<br>
man kind have not prevailed. 
<br>
<p>We as humans of this time and place have made tremendous 
<br>
achievements and monumental failures. We are at 
<br>
the cusp of discovery and surging our civilization into the outer
<br>
reaches of 
<br>
space and time. The required 
<br>
resources, technology, and human endeavor are at our collective 
<br>
fingertips. As a world of one people (with 
<br>
many individual desires) working together for a common goal we can 
<br>
achieve things we haven't even imagined 
<br>
yet and things that we have. 
<br>
<p>So here we are today. No ideas no matter how noble or evil ever works 
<br>
out the way we have them planned. 
<br>
This conflict is now already out of control and has reached critical
<br>
mass. 
<br>
<p>The question is how fast will this uncontrolled reaction take to
<br>
explode.... 
<br>
Days, weeks, months?? 
<br>
<p>Make no mistakes, WE ARE THERE!! 
<br>
<p>Here are the simple choices:
<br>
<p>1) Let it ride; don't change anything.. Over 90% of the world human 
<br>
population will be gone. To be left after it is 
<br>
said in done wouldn't be a bad thing.. The opportunity to survive and be
<br>
<p>the seeds to the next civilization and 
<br>
help pickup where the last one left off. To have learned from the
<br>
mistakes 
<br>
and be able to teach and grow again. 
<br>
Like a natural wild fire that clears out the old growth making way for
<br>
the 
<br>
new and continuing cycle of an old 
<br>
growth forest (which there aren't many of those left). Of course the
<br>
trick to 
<br>
this is surviving. Could be tough. Are 
<br>
you cut out for it? Are you the one in the 720,000,000 million people
<br>
who 
<br>
will survive?
<br>
<p>2) Make the change. Yes it is that simple. Make the change. This has to 
<br>
come collectively between every 
<br>
human. Sound like too big of an obstacle? Consider the other option. We 
<br>
are the people of earth. We are not all 
<br>
represented by Saddam
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hussein, Osama bin Laden, Yasser Arafat, Tony Blair, George W. Bush. 
<br>
Etc. 
<br>
<p>People everywhere need to make this choice. All things need to change.  
<br>
I want to quote John Lennon for some 
<br>
advice. Past this, you have to go back to choice #1.
<br>
<p>Imagine
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Lennon 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine there's no heaven
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's easy if you try
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No hell below us
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above us only sky
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine all the people
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living for today... 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine there's no countries
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It isn't hard to do
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to kill or die for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no religion too
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine all the people
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living life in peace... 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may say I'm a dreamer
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I'm not the only one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope someday you'll join us
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the world will be as one 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine no possessions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if you can
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need for greed or hunger
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brotherhood of man
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine all the people
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing all the world... 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may say I'm a dreamer
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I'm not the only one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope someday you'll join us
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the world will live as one
<br>
<p><p>Congratulations and good luck to all of you. What a time to be alive. 
<br>
Embrace this life with all of its infinite 
<br>
possibilities and wonders. Love yourselves and your children. 
<br>
<p>Please translate this in to as many languages and forward onto as many 
<br>
persons as you can. 
<br>
<p>Remember, every end is just another beginning.
