<em>&gt; Unfortunately, quite a few people seem to have found or rediscovered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their belief in a god/higher power in the aftermath of this tragedy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've been trying to find a label for people who have such a belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but don't believe in the mythology of any specific religion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, if anything, it knocked down a lot of my belief in such. Too
<br>
bad too as some of those beliefs might have been a comfort.  But when
<br>
something really rough hits I need to be realist and the same time
<br>
I seek what grounding I can find.  Too many religious people were
<br>
handing out too much snake oil that was neither effective in treating
<br>
the massive trauma of the people or of facing the problems squarely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Non-creedal theist&quot; or &quot;non-denominational theist&quot; might work,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though I get the impression that [non]creedal and [non]denominational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have fairly specific meanings among protestant christians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Non-religious theist&quot; or plain &quot;theist&quot; don't sound right either,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as religiousness and theism appear to be synonyms.
</em><br>
<p>Sigh.  Buddhism is not the least bit theistic.  Many branches of Hinduism
<br>
are either not theistic or panentheistic or see theism as just one way
<br>
people wrap up their ideas of perfection or of hope at some stages of their
<br>
development.  Many Christians don't believe in a God that looks very
<br>
much at all like what many of us may have learned in Sunday School.  And
<br>
I don't know where the place the cybergnostic among us.
