<p>I haven't heard about this and will need to investigate.

<p><em>&gt; Anyway, it's not big news anymore.
</em><br>
<p>Speaking as someone who has watched computer architectures evolve
<br>
over 20 years and who understands the bottlenecks in such architectures
<br>
pretty well -- I'd say its &quot;big news&quot; if IBM or Intel has licensed
<br>
the TERA patents (pointing out that TERA is the real innovator)
<br>
or have bypassed the TERA patents (pointing out how sloppy the
<br>
TERA attorneys are or how clever the IBM/Intel attorneys are).
<br>
<p>A decade ago nobody realized that it is the CPU-to-memory
<br>
bandwidth that is the big problem.  Now IBM is building an
<br>
entire architecture designed to avoid that.  It isn't clear
<br>
to me whether Intel is following suit, but they are investing
<br>
huge amounts in chip architectures (multi-level caches, multi-ALUs,
<br>
etc.) that seem to be oriented towards avoiding solving that problem.
<br>
Further there are no indications that they are trying to integrate
<br>
the memory with the logic on a single chip (as IBM is doing).
<br>
<p>IBM in contrast seems willing to take the hit and develop a process
<br>
that supports memory and logic on the same chip.  Big difference
<br>
in corporate strategies.
<br>
<p>INTEL seems to be planning for the 5 year time frame while IBM
<br>
seems to be planning for the 10 year time frame.
<br>
<p>If IBM has identified the high-growth market and has developed
<br>
a better chip and systems architecture to address that market
<br>
then the market may divide again into &quot;consumer systems&quot;
<br>
and &quot;research systems&quot; where the consumer systems will
<br>
be replaced by research systems as they get smaller and more
<br>
cost effective.
