<em>&gt;The image of them cheering is hard to get rid of.
</em><br>
<p>Which is probably why the clip was played over and over again... or maybe I
<br>
am wording that wrongly. I should probably say that the viewers were played
<br>
by those that screened the tape of those kids. It was guaranteed to get a
<br>
nasty reaction. It almost certainly was not representative. So, why do you
<br>
think they showed it?
<br>

<br>
Oh oh I know! Maybe it's because the Palestinians are the sworn blood
<br>
enemies of the people who own the papers and the TV stations. Whaddya
<br>
think huh? Could it be ? Could it be?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I said it before and I'll say it again. When you wrestle a pig, expect to
<br>
get
<br>
muddy. When you ally with people who rival Hitler for sheer murderous
<br>
villiany, don't expect to be loved by their (and your) victims!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sad thing is I will likely be fixing the broken and wounded who
<br>
suffer
<br>
for the greed of Israel and her allies in America for the next few years.
<br>
&nbsp;I fully expect we will see many more USS Cole's.  I also consider
<br>
Sep 11th, 2001 to be a clear sequel to June 8th, 1967.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberty was attacked , Bush got that right, but it was attacked in '67,
<br>
and the same folks are at the root of the attacks on Liberty this month.
