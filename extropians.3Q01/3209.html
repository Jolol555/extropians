Spike, your experiences with other lists seem to fit mine too. 
<br>
<p>On the extropians list there is a lot of noise, a lot of strong words but
<br>
also some good posts. People who can stand this mix stay, people who get
<br>
too upset leave (it doesn't matter if they leave for a good reason or not,
<br>
they will leave in any case). The result is a kind of stable environment
<br>
where the occasional upsurge of a gun or racism debate is just an upsurge.
<br>
It is a bit like selforganized criticality in physics.
<br>
<p>Compare this to a quiet list, where everybody keeps on-topic most of the
<br>
time and contentious issues seldom come up. When such an issue appears, it
<br>
causes a serious disruption of the normal list culture, sometimes to the
<br>
extent that key people leave and the list dies. This is likely a question
<br>
about how strong investment people have in the list culture; if they feel
<br>
it to be important to them, they will try to remain and fight to retain it,
<br>
even by not bashing other people as hard as they think they morally ought
<br>
to.  This model predicts that a flamewar would get far more serious on a
<br>
quiet list with less strong investment in list culture than on a quiet list
<br>
with many long-term members committed to the list culture or subject. The
<br>
most flame resistant lists would be the noisy ones.
<br>
<p>It seems to fit in with my experience on the Swedish transhumanist list
<br>
omega where the first serious flamewar practically broke it. Spike, how
<br>
would you rate the investment people make in list culture on the lists you
<br>
mention?
<br>
