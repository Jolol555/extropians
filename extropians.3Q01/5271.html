<p><em>&gt; Realists don't worry about conflict resolution very much. Right is right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is right, right? So if a person has a problem it's a problem with what's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right, right?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, we would make that accusation against you!  We live
<br>
in the same reality as everyone else (to our way of thinking),
<br>
and so resolving what is true is a common task that we can
<br>
all engage in.  It's people who live in their own worlds (or,
<br>
like you, say that they do) who hardly need to rectify discrepancy.
<br>
They can &quot;agree to disagree&quot;.  What's to prevent one nominalist
<br>
from saying, &quot;well, I don't *like* so-and-so's theory, and there
<br>
is nothing that you can show me or say to change my mind&quot;?  But
<br>
this will probably be yet one more question that you totally
<br>
ignore.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The point is debate, dialectic, and conflict are essential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the emergence of truth.  Realism gums up the works.
</em><br>
<p>But isn't truth, according to you, what people create?  So
<br>
why should they have to create *one* single thing?  Debate,
<br>
seems rather idle, I would think, if each has his own truth.
