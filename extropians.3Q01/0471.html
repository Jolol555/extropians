</em><br>
<p>I thought Monica was very reasonable.  The pool and hair incidents showed
<br>
David had the capacity to kill people, yet lacked the judgement
<br>
to properly restrain himself.  He didn't *intend* to hurt people, sure,
<br>
but it's results that count.  And, as the robocide scene shows, Henry
<br>
was right about intent - David could be vicious under the right circumstances.
<br>
Not that urges to do such things are unusual in people - but we (normally)
<br>
control ourselves.  David lacked the necessary judgement and self-control
<br>
Buggy beta version, as some have said.
<br>
<p>(I agree the decision to imprint was completely out of the blue)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Moreover, the idea that a computer like David would be so flawed as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe so strongly in a fairy tale is completely unbelievable.
</em><br>
<p>No - very believable - ever heard of an infinite loop?  Another
<br>
very serious beta bug.
