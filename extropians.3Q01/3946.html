<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe, based on the empirical track record of science, that scientists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will find out what, if any, mechanism control human behaviour, down to how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to treat various societal ills, like racism and nationalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It looks like your belief is based on the empirical track record
<br>
of science in errors other than the &quot;softer&quot; areas of human
<br>
motivations, values, social systems and so on.  There is a
<br>
hidden assumption that these soft areas are equally capable of
<br>
being understood fully with only the scientific method.  There
<br>
is considerable doubt of this at the moment.  And indeed, there
<br>
is no particular reason it should turn out to be so.  
<br>
<p>I believe a lot will be done in the area with science but I do
<br>
not believe that we will find full answers in these areas that
<br>
way, at least not with the science of today.  So I have traded
<br>
you one belief for another.
