<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Vitamin E enhances immune cells in old mice
<br>
<p>A study published in the October 1 2001 Journal of Immunology
<br>
<a href="http://www.jimmunol.org/">http://www.jimmunol.org/</a> showed &quot;for the first time that supplemental
<br>
vitamin E has direct immunoenhancing effect on naive T cells from old mice.&quot;
<br>
T cells are immune cells whose proliferation and function decline with age,
<br>
partly due to increased production of PGE2 by macrophages which suppresses
<br>
them. Interluekin-2, made by T-helper cells when they are stimulated by an
<br>
infection, also declines with age. There is a shift with aging toward
<br>
greater proportions of memory T cells and fewer naive T cells that have not
<br>
encountered antigens.  Naive T cells also exhibit a decline in function with
<br>
aging.  Some changes in T cell function that are seen in aging may be due to
<br>
free radical damage.  Because the antioxidant vitamin E is known to increase
<br>
T Cell function in aged humans and animals, researchers from Tufts
<br>
University in Boston sought to determine if its T cell enhancing mechanism
<br>
is other than that of its previously demonstrated ability to reduce PGE2.
<br>
<p>Researchers purified T cells obtained from the spleens of young and old
<br>
healthy male mice and incubated them in a solution containing
<br>
alpha-tocopherol in a concentration representing average plasma
<br>
alpha-tocopherol levels of humans taking 200 international units of vitamin
<br>
E per day.  Control T cells from young mice and old mice were incubated in a
<br>
solution that did not contain vitamin E. An examination of vitamin E uptake
<br>
in old and young cells showed no difference between the two groups.
<br>
<p>The proliferative capacity of T cells from old mice was found to be lower
<br>
than that of young animals.  Vitamin E increased the proliferative capacity
<br>
of the T cells of old mice, while those from young mice did not show an
<br>
increase.  No PGE2 could be stimulated in the samples collected, showing
<br>
that vitamin E's effect on T cell proliferation did not occur though
<br>
reduction of PGE2. After forty-eight hours, interleukin-2 secretion was
<br>
significantly lower in old mice compared to young mice but in the vitamin-E
<br>
supplemented cells of old mice, levels were restored to that of young cells.
<br>
This finding was not due to the increase in proliferative capacity observed
<br>
in the vitamin E enhanced cells.
<br>
<p>When naive T cells were examined, vitamin E was found to increase their
<br>
ability in old mice to progress through cell division cycles, however the
<br>
effect was not observed for memory T cells.  The researchers concluded that
<br>
it is the naive T cells that experience the greatest age-related decline in
<br>
interleukin-2 production, and that vitamin E acts specifically on these
<br>
cells.  They summarize that the increased free radical burden associated
<br>
with aging leads to damage resulting in an age-associated decline in T cell
<br>
response which can be partially reversed in vitro by dietary antioxidant
<br>
supplementation.  This study revealed that vitamin E has a direct effect on
<br>
T cells in addition to its inhibition of PGE production.
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
Another reason why women live longer
<br>
<p>Research published in the September 2001 issue of the journal Clinical and
<br>
Experimental Immunology and summarized in New Scientist has established that
<br>
the stronger immune system of women could be a reason why they live longer
<br>
in modern societies. A team at the Imperial College School of Medicine in
<br>
London discovered that women have higher levels of new T lymphocytes than
<br>
men of equal age.
<br>
<p>T cells are immune system cells that are made by the thymus, a gland that
<br>
shrinks 3% every year after birth until middle age, after which it shrinks
<br>
1% yearly. The researchers in this study measured the amount of new T cells
<br>
in forty-six men and women aged 20 to 62. They also examined statistics
<br>
regarding deaths from influenza and pneumonia in the UK between 1993 and
<br>
1998. What they found is that peripheral blood samples from males contained
<br>
significantly lower levels of a marker for recent thymic emigrants than
<br>
females of the same age, although both levels declined with age, and that
<br>
more men than women died of the infections during the period studied, with
<br>
the risk of death of infection for men and women correlated with their
<br>
differences in thymic activity.

<p><p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Immune enhancement
<br>
<p>Free radicals have been linked to immune system damage that accompanies
<br>
normal aging. A strong immune system is critical to the prevention of
<br>
infection by viruses, fungi, and bacteria. It is thought that cancer cells
<br>
form regularly, and that a vigilant immune response is therefore required to
<br>
kill or deactivate these deformed cells before they become malignant tumors.
<br>
Members of the Life Extension Foundation have long been encouraged to follow
<br>
a daily antioxidant regimen that protects against immune-suppressing free
<br>
radicals.
<br>
<p>The incidence of cancer and new infectious diseases increases every year in
<br>
the United States. In addition, many dangerous bacteria have become
<br>
resistant to the antibiotics that once kept them in check. These virulent,
<br>
antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria are increasingly becoming a threat
<br>
to our lives. There is strong scientific evidence showing that antioxidants
<br>
and other natural therapies can play an important role in maintaining and
<br>
enhancing immune function.
<br>
<p>The concept that appropriate nutrients can enhance the human immune response
<br>
is known as nutritional immunology. The foundation of this field of study
<br>
was laid in the early 1800s when physicians discovered that severe
<br>
malnutrition led to thymic atrophy. For most of that century, the evidence
<br>
of a relationship between malnutrition and the immune system was based on
<br>
anatomical findings. With the discovery of vitamins, it became evident that
<br>
essential nutrients played a critical role in maintaining immune function.
<br>
<p>Studies published in the 1980s and 1990s clearly show specific
<br>
immune-enhancing effects of the proper use of nutritional supplements,
<br>
proteins, hormones, and certain drugs. Micronutrients are now known to play
<br>
a key role in many of the metabolic processes that promote survival from
<br>
critical illnesses.
<br>
<p>Vitamins are essential for oxidative phosphorylation and protection against
<br>
oxidants. Dietary supplementation with ascorbic acid, tocopherols, and
<br>
vitamin B6 enhances several aspects of lymphocyte function. Benefits are
<br>
most evident in the elderly.

<br>
The spice of life:  Unlocking the power of curcumin
<br>
<p>Curcumin, the extract found in a common household spice, is common no
<br>
longer. It's been drawing more and more attention among medical experts the
<br>
last several years for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory qualities.
<br>
<p>When the body responds to a physical injury, a series of changes occurs
<br>
through which free radicals are released. These free radicals, or
<br>
&quot;oxidants,&quot; protect the body from foreign invasion, such as infection.
<br>
However, in the process of killing invading bacteria, oxidants can also harm
<br>
our cells. Such oxidants can include superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl
<br>
radicals and lipid peroxides. Over time, as our cells continue to be
<br>
affected by these free radicals, or oxidants, organs begin to degenerate.
<br>
The result can be such diseases and conditions as chronic inflammation,
<br>
heart disease, aging acceleration and chaotic cell growth leading to cancer.
<br>
<p>The body does have built-in defense mechanisms to protect itself from free
<br>
radical damage, but eventually, aging and disease deplete the body's ability
<br>
to keep oxidants at bay. Studies show that curcumin can inhibit, or possibly
<br>
even reverse this process by scavenging or neutralizing free radicals and
<br>
breaking their subsequent oxidative chain reaction.
<br>
<p>Research as early as 1995 has shown that a diet that includes curcumin can
<br>
restrict this oxidative stress. Scientists in India found curcumin inhibited
<br>
lipid peroxidation, superoxides and hydroxyl radical.
