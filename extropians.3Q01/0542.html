<p><em>&gt; &gt; Two claims are implicit here; one is that whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these terms refer to, they ought to be replaced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terms that do not derive from traditional religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beliefs.  I find this very persuasive for a variety
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of reasons, chief among them that it would prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simple miscommunication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What for?  Why should they be replaced unless there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a tacit assumption that religiosity (is this a word and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what precisely is its meaning?) is utterly false.  I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not grant this assumption.
</em><br>
<p>Like I say, because they mean so many things to so many
<br>
different people; communication is impeded.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The second claim is that traditional religious beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are false, and therefore need to be debunked.  Few on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this list with argue with that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What exactly is meant?  The statement is too broad.  
</em><br>
<p>I meant belief in gods and spirits (of a more literal
<br>
bent).  (Sure, when used metaphorically, like &quot;there
<br>
was a spirit of happiness at Extro-5&quot;, no claim of
<br>
the existence of any kind of literal spirit is implied,
<br>
but many traditional religions do believe in spirits.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then why throw this one out?  Pandering?  Do you not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see that we &quot;pander&quot; here all the time to opposite beliefs?
</em><br>
<p>Um, no.  Can you describe what we do to opposing beliefs
<br>
here all the time?  (&quot;Pander&quot; literally means to gratify
<br>
someone's weakness or vulgar tastes.  I meant to make an
<br>
appearance of agreeing with something we really think to
<br>
be wrong---I'm not sure; I may have used the word incorrectly.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; That's one of the reasons that the term is inherently confusing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now among people whose beliefs are very similar, and so where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; little or no confusion is liable to occur, use of the term is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; quite warranted, of course.  But here, where we would like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; determine (I hope) just what substance lies behind use of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; term, I for one want to understand what drives atheists and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; materialists to ever use it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am neiter an atheist (although I don't believe in a God
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remotely like many theists do) or a materialist (in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictionary meaning of the word) so I can't help you.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why the tacit assumption that only atheists and materialists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need be consulted to understand if spirituality has value?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry---I thought that you were an atheist and a materialist.
<br>
Perhaps even those words are now suspect.  Still, despite all
<br>
the foregoing discussion, you haven't indicated what you mean
<br>
by &quot;spirituality&quot; or &quot;religiosity&quot;.  Now I *am not* asking for
<br>
strict definitions---well have I known since a small child the
<br>
futility of that---I merely would like a couple of examples of
<br>
how you might use some phrases (instead of those words) to get
<br>
the idea across.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do not think atheists or materialists are impoverished.  After
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all I spent more than a little time in that position myself.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully understand it.  It is not my home, not where I find my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life most rich and fulfilling, but I certainly don't denigrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that position at all.
</em><br>
<p>Neat.  But I still have very little sense at all of what
<br>
you're trying to convey when &quot;spirituality&quot; or &quot;religiousity&quot;
<br>
pops up in your sentences.
