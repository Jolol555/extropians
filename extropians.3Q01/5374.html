<p><em>&gt; &gt; Approximate assertions, e.g., &quot;the planets orbit the sun in ellipses&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should be taken as (a) true, and (b) a correct description of reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why?
</em><br>
<p>Because (1) you cannot *say* how something moves, just as you 
<br>
cannot *say* what something is  (2) no description is completely
<br>
one-hundred percent accurate  (3) we need to pack as much meaning
<br>
and truth into pronouncements as we economically can.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are solutions of general relativity in which the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving around the earth and the earth is standing still. Saying that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planets orbit the sun in ellipses is saying that the sun's frame of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reference is preferred to the earth's. This preference for one frame of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reference is apparently subjective.
</em><br>
<p>Language is used to communicate structure, ideas, and relationships.
<br>
It would be absurd to specify the intended frame of reference for
<br>
every statement.  Likewise it would be absurd to have to say
<br>
&quot;approximate ellipses&quot; and &quot;approximate orbits&quot;.  Moreover, how
<br>
could one define &quot;sun&quot;?  A hot ball of gas?  But exactly what 
<br>
molecules does that include, and when?  And so on.
<br>
<p>However, to get into the spirit of the thing, and point out how
<br>
your paragraph itself is not &quot;totally accurate&quot;, would the
<br>
following be preferable?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;I&quot; think that there are formal mathematical results that are often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called &quot;solutions&quot; of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which the entire so-called universe &quot;instantaneously&quot; for some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time t0 rotates about some point p0 inside the &quot;Earth&quot; and most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particles of the Earth at t0 are moving only &quot;infinitesimally&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relative to all the other particles of the &quot;Earth&quot; and that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vast majority of those particles have a very small collective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motion relative to p0.
</em><br>
<p>Well... that was just the first sentence!  But I hope you see my
<br>
point:  even my amended version has a lot of ambiguous terms that
<br>
still require elaboration and qualification if the sentence were
<br>
to be 100% accurate.
<br>
