<em>&gt; &gt;However, there is far more to building codes than just fire prevention:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;earthquake, flood, hurricane, as well as simple accident prevention. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;building and fire codes that your local governments institute are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;conjured out of thin air. In fact, the original fire codes were, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fact, instituted by insurance company fire chiefs and building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;inspectors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's what I said - the change in practice (which was indeed about more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than fire hazard) was produced by purely private action - the other key
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups are landlords and developers, hence the use of covenants long before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any code is adopted, local or otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>Landlords and developers are heinously negligent in the implementation,
<br>
and covenant requirements are non-existent unless mandated by a third
<br>
party: the insurance industry or local community. Anything they are not
<br>
required to do, they do not do, and they fight tooth and nail against
<br>
new building code additions that require expensive new systems or
<br>
expensive changes in structural design.
<br>
<p>As for fire safety measures, they do mandate the most obvious and long
<br>
accepted measures: mandating smoke alarms, fire extinguishers, and clear
<br>
fire lanes for evacuation, though most do so only due to the threat of
<br>
fines to themselves from quarterly or annual fire inspections if their
<br>
community has them. Note the money thing there....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Today, non governmental groups like the ICBO (International
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Conference of Building Officials), BOCA, etc meet regularly to refine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;their codes, which are called 'model codes': they have no weight of law,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;but insurance companies rely on them, and most all state, county, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;local governments base their own building and fire codes on these model
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;codes, revising their own codes every 4-12 years as the groups issue new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;versions with changes that have been debated and voted on by the members
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;from all over the country and the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;These codes are not instituted by fiat, they are not promulgated out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;thin air. They are typically studied with detailed scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;experiments, with reports issued and significant peer review done before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;conclusions are drawn and proposed code changes are written based upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the newest research.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed, in fact this happens much more widely. The commercial codes of most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states of the US have been largely drawn up this way, as I understant it.
</em><br>
<p>That is what I said.
