<p>Of course, this was way back in the days before computers.  But from what
<br>
I've read and observed about American adults in general - how deep their
<br>
ignorance is when confronted with questions about geography and basic
<br>
science - I wouldn't be surprised if American schools are still lagging
<br>
behind many schools in countries we consider &quot;poor,&quot; &quot;third world&quot; or
<br>
&quot;backward.&quot;  Of course, we have compulsory education - which may partly
<br>
account for the skew.

<p>Olga, I'm going to try and be gentle about this.  Your 'bold' (I'm being nice) message fired up my juices.  The stupid American adults you alluded to are probably loaning your country money.  If we are so crummy and uneducated why do we repeatedly lead the world along intellectually, scientifically, philosophically, politically....and most importantly, creatively.
<br>
<p>I grew up in public schools, got an engineering degree at a state university, passed my professional engineering exams on the first go round.  I have a wonderful, free-lance career developing machines for the world.  I am VERY grateful for the educational system here.  NOTHING I have encountered in the 'real world' has come close to being as difficult and taxing as my course work in a public university.
<br>
<p>I am SICK and TIRED of people bashing Americans and our educational system!  You get what you put into it, on an individual basis.
