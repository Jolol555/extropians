Actually I have done some work with autonomous robots battling it out in an arena with my department at university (Bradford department of Cybernetics and virtual worlds).
<br>
<p>To attach weapons to our robots would have been a simple matter and far more fun.  
<br>
<p>As Adrian Tymes stated, autonomous robots tend to stuck on scenery (despite all precautions to stop such a thing) and could not compete against remote controlled battlebots.
<br>
<p>Still we had our robots chasing each other around a maze.  It was just a shame that my head of department hijacked the final evalutaion of the robots for a publicity stunt.  The fool turned up all the lights so that the photographers could get photos, and of course, up goes the ambient light, down goes the reliablity of the robot's light sensors and all the 'bots go chasing after windows and computer screens, hmmmph!
<br>
<p>Still I think an autonomous version of robot wars would be quite cool to watch.
<br>
Sigh.....if only I was at Reading department of cybernetics rather than Bradford.
