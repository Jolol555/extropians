<em>&gt; If everyone doesn't mind me asking, how old are the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; How old is the oldest member? THen I wondered, how old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the youngest?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, I became curious. So those of you who wish to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer, I would appreciate it. Private emails are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fine.
</em><br>
<p>Ages range from teenagers up to senior citizens (some are even dead). I
<br>
don't know who you were quoting, but unless they have a family history
<br>
of early aging or terminal illness, I wouldn't worry about it. While my
<br>
own family has an average life expectancy somewhere between 85-99 (going
<br>
by my grandparents current ages and the ages at which my
<br>
greatgrandmonsters died), I personally expect anyone with a more normal
<br>
expectancy who is 30-35 today to make it to the point where practical
<br>
immortality is attained. Because the primary amount of pre-60 mortality
<br>
actually occurs in childhood, if you are an adult today without any
<br>
significant family histories of terminal illnesses I think you can
<br>
expect to live to see reviving technology become practical. For this
<br>
young crowd, cryonic suspesion is simply an insurance policy, not an
<br>
unavoidable situation for one who wants to live forever. The older folks
<br>
need this absolutely in order to voyage to a future where they can be
<br>
cured and revived.
<br>
<p>I'm 33 now, so I expect to make it at least to the year 2058 without any
<br>
significant intervention (assuming I don't upload before that time)
<br>
outside of possibly reconstructive back surgery (my 2nd lumbar was
<br>
fractured in college, and now its a pain in the back, literally, to stay
<br>
in shape). I wouldn't mind some titanium vertebra....
