<p>
<em>&gt; This is another one of the ignorant 'free lunch' claims that can't pan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out. Matter that falls into a black hole isn't 'crushed out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence'. Its mass adds to the gravitational field of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black hole.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus in a universe of infinite age, some proportion of black 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holes would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have infinite mass, and would thus cause the infinite universe to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroy itself.
</em><br>
<p><p>It cant get infinite mass without being fed an infinite amount of matter or
<br>
energy.
<br>
<p>Off topic, this kind of actually happens on the sci-fi channel show Lexx
<br>
(Fridays 10pm est). Don't know how many of you watch this, but its got some
<br>
very interesting concepts thrown around. i.e.
<br>
<p>In one episode, the main stars are being pursued by some maniac that creates
<br>
the equivalent of macroscopic &quot;gray goo&quot;. He's made these machines that eat
<br>
planets and make copies of themselves. The bad guy finally converts all the
<br>
matter in the universe into the machines except for the main characters and
<br>
their spaceship &quot;Lexx&quot;. He tells his machines to go after them and kill
<br>
them, but in doing so, he makes too much matter move too quickly and
<br>
collapses the universe a split second after the heroes escape through a
<br>
wormhole into another universe.
<br>
<p>Another interesting one: The crew of the Lexx discover Earth. The robot on
<br>
board reports that it is a typical class 13 planet, mostly doomed due to
<br>
nuclear, biological, or nanotechnilogical disaster, but that most likely,
<br>
they will destroy their selves chasing the Higgs-Boson particle...
<br>
accidentally creating a growing black hole that will consume the planet.
<br>
<p>Gotta admit, any show where a universe is destroyed in a non-sweeps week
<br>
episode, HAS to be pretty cool :)
