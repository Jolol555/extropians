<br>
<p>&quot;Once you've built a circuit from molecular-scale devices 
<br>
-- something about the size of a bacterium -- the question is 
<br>
how you get data into and out of it,&quot; said Kuekes, computer 
<br>
architect and senior scientist, HP Labs. &quot;In order to do that, 
<br>
you have to bridge the size gap between molecular-scale wires 
<br>
and current technology, which is about a hundred times bigger.&quot; 
<br>
Tiny wires in today's integrated circuits are addressed through 
<br>
a device called a demultiplexer. However, building a demultiplexer 
<br>
requires an extremely precise, very complex pattern of connections. 
<br>
Since it would be virtually impossible to make such precise connections 
<br>
with molecular-scale wires, the new patent proposes making connections 
<br>
randomly using a chemical process. The resulting pattern can then be 
<br>
determined using computer algorithms. &quot;We've essentially created a city 
<br>
of streets crossed by avenues, but they're so tiny we can't paint the street 
<br>
signs,&quot; said Kuekes. &quot;Instead, we have a chemical process that gives each 
<br>
street and avenue a unique name. Then we run a program that identifies all the 
<br>
thoroughfares by their names and enables us to create a map of the city. 
<br>
Once you have that map, you can store and retrieve information at any intersection.&quot; 
<br>
HP and its partners at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), 
<br>
expect to be able to fabricate a 16-kilobit memory using this approach by 2005.
