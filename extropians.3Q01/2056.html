Researcher: We descended from 33 daughters of Eve
<br>
After taking several thousand DNA samples, the clan mothers in Europe
<br>
were
<br>
narrowed down to &quot;The Seven Mothers of Eve,&quot; the title of his new book
<br>
chronicling his DNA detective work.
<br>
<p>&quot;To bring these women alive I gave them names and worked out where they
<br>
lived and when. They range from Ursula in Greece 45,000 years ago to
<br>
Jasmine
<br>
10,000 years ago in Syria -- she came from the Middle East along with
<br>
the
<br>
farmers,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>&quot;There are roughly 33 equivalent clusters if you take the whole world.
<br>
Eventually it all comes down to Mitochondrial Eve in Africa 200,000
<br>
years
<br>
ago,&quot; he added.
<br>
<p>Sykes said &quot;Thousand of people have asked to have a DNA test to find out
<br>
who
<br>
they are descended from.&quot;
<br>
<p>So oxfordancestors.com was set up on the Internet. ---&gt; ---&gt; ---&gt;

Discover which Daughter is your Ancestor
<br>
We all carry mtDNA inherited from our mothers. Our MatriLine service
<br>
analyses your DNA and finds the link between you and your ancestral
<br>
mother -
<br>
one of the Seven Daughters of Eve if your roots are in Europe.
<br>
<p>But you do not have to be European to benefit from the MatriLine
<br>
service. We
<br>
have an extensive database which will match your DNA to one of the other
<br>
27
<br>
clans so far discovered throughout the world
<br>
============================================
<br>
Give the Gift of a Thousand Lifetimes.
<br>
Having trouble finding an original gift for the friend who has
<br>
everything?
<br>
Now you can purchase it from Oxford Ancestors.
<br>
<p>To mark the publication of &quot;The Seven Daughters of Eve&quot;, Oxford
<br>
Ancestors
<br>
has prepared a special MatriLineT gift pack to provide the ultimate
<br>
original
<br>
present.
<br>
<p>The attractive pack contains everything needed to take and return a DNA
<br>
sample for the test, which will reveal your friend's deep maternal
<br>
ancestry.
<br>
With the fees prepaid by you, your friend need only collect a few inner
<br>
cheek cells, which is completely painless, using the special brush
<br>
provided,
<br>
then mail it back to Oxford Ancestors in the return envelope.
<br>
<p>After the analysis, which typically takes 4 - 6 weeks, your friend will
<br>
receive the full MatriLineT results service, including:

============================================
<br>
And you wouldn't want to leave out the Y's!
<br>
<p>Y-LineT
<br>
Unlock the Secrets of the Y-chromosome
<br>
Y-Line is our new DNA-based service designed to help you research your
<br>
genealogy or family history. Set to revolutionise the art of genealogy,
<br>
Y-Line works by producing a genetic signature of your Y-chromosome. This
<br>
is
<br>
the chromosome that is passed from father to son.
<br>
<p>Although Y-chromosome signatures do change very slowly over time, the
<br>
pattern is stable over hundreds of years. This means that male relatives
<br>
who
<br>
have an uninterrupted male-male link between them will share the same,
<br>
or
<br>
very similar, Y-chromosome signatures. Y-Line is particularly useful
<br>
when a
<br>
connection between different branches of a family, perhaps with the same
<br>
surname, is suspected but cannot be proven from written records. Y-Line,
<br>
by
<br>
comparing the Y-chromosome signatures, provides the answer.
<br>
<p>Y-Line analyses ten different genetic sites to construct a Y-chromosome
<br>
signature.
