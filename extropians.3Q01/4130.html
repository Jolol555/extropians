<p>&quot;Long in the tooth&quot; might be a point in favor; Prof Paz is supposed to be frail.
<br>
My problem is that he's also supposed by many to be a roman-a-clef for Robert leFavre.
<br>
<p>The player has to speak the part &quot;I pray you, trippingly on the tongue&quot;. I'd cast Vincent Price in a heartbeat if he
<br>
were still alive. How about Martin Landau? I still think Lithgow is a win.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Casting would have to take into account

</em><br>
<p>Yup. Why does a professor with such a surname have to appear clearly to be a Mestizo or Castilian? Why couldn't he be of
<br>
mixed German-Argentinian extraction, say? Or maybe just from New Orleans? How much do we _know_? I haven't got the text
<br>
available.
<br>
<p>Are we casting for PC cartoon diversity roll call [&quot;Negro!&quot; &quot;Here!&quot; &quot;Asian!&quot; &quot;Here!&quot; &quot;Girl!&quot; &quot;Here!&quot; &quot;Redhead!&quot;...], or
<br>
for the best actor for the part? Hmm? I mean, that might be what happened to Juan Rico in the mostly execrable _John
<br>
Verhoeven's Starship Troopers_ [sic].
<br>
<p>M, slightly nettled...
