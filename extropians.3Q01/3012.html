<em>&gt; The question is what do we do about it? I await the attitude of the US 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Senate to the proposed theocratic anti-cloning law. I am not optimistic. 
</em><br>
<p>I suggest that extropians construct and live in their own independent colony (as the alternative solution other than activism, ignoring (the opposition) and &quot;apathetism&quot;), and fund it independently. Then they will have the freedom to conduct experiments necessary to allow Singularity and Transhumanism to occur without worrying about politics. The general idea lies with the agreement that each group will not interfere with each other as long as the other group does not interfere too.
<br>
<p>To do otherwise would mean having to row the boat of science against the strong current of oppositon and also go against the extropian value of respecting other's opinions, for if one succeeds in making policy changes to allow transhuman research, one will inevitably affect everyone else with this change.
<br>
<p>Prepare for a lot of blood, sweat and tears, and the possibility that the anti-science will prevail in the end and block the avenues of progress, if you choose this route.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I know you're all doing this stuff already (aren't you?). This is just a pep 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk (and a restatement of my standing offer to help, and an acknowledgment 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the excellent help that I've found is available here).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I wish that someone would help with the Sociologistics Project I had started with extropian thinking in mind (even though I did not actually know the term &quot;extropian&quot; yet when I started it). I think it will come in handy eventually when we (and other groups) set up independent space colonies. This project also focuses on the often neglected Infostructure systems (e.g. political &amp; economical systems) rather than solely on the tangible Infrastructure system (e.g. transportation, defence).
<br>
<p>However, no one of the few members on the Sociologistics list (<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sociologistics">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sociologistics</a>) had actively participated in fomulating useful principles and only one had actually posted to the list at all. I often wonder why such an important project has so little participation.
<br>
<p>I would had gladly devoted time occassionally to developing it but unfortunately I have to go for compulsory military service in a year or two's time (as I live in Singapore) which will delay the construction of the theory, forcing me to publish it in an incomplete state so that the others can help to complete it (and also to reduce information losses in case of any unexpected accidents).
<br>
<p>May the force be with us. (Perhaps, if you can't use &quot;the Force&quot;, then hopefully you won't need to use force.)
