</em><br>
<p>I think you are misunderstanding my words. Acceptance of risk is not the
<br>
same as acceptance of responsibility. We do have a concept here in NH
<br>
called caveat emptor: &quot;buyer beware&quot;. You engage in risky activity
<br>
voluntarily, and cannot hold others responsible for your lack of due
<br>
diligence, but you can hold them responsible for actions outside the
<br>
envelope.
<br>
<p>You get on a commercial aircraft knowing there is a 0.002 in 100,000
<br>
chance of dying on it. You can insure against this risk, and you can
<br>
hold others responsible if they acted improperly, but all else being
<br>
equal, you cannot hold others responsible for acts of god or nature.
<br>
<p>For example, if you are walking on a roadway and the tire of a car kicks
<br>
a pebble off the road that hits you in the eye and blinds you, you can't
<br>
hold that car or its driver responsible, but if that pebble falls off of
<br>
a gravel truck that has insufficiently restrained its cargo, you can
<br>
hold the truck's owners and the driver responsible.
<br>
<p>However, this is totally outside the bounds of the previous discussion,
<br>
which is about voluntary assumption of risk (which is separate from
<br>
responsibility). It is considered polite for a man to walk on the side
<br>
of the sidewalk nearest the road when walking with a woman, which is all
<br>
part of the tradition of 'women and children first' chivalry of men
<br>
assuming the greater risk. Whether this risk is of being splashed by
<br>
passing cars, or hit first by an errant vehicle, this risk is presumed
<br>
as a basis for this behavior.
<br>
<p>When driving a vehicle, you are assuming a risk that you may cause an
<br>
accident, for which you obtain insurance, which also generally covers
<br>
pedestrians. Similarly, pedestrians generally have the right of way on
<br>
crosswalks and sidewalks, but not on open roadway.
<br>
<p>These rules all exist because people recognise that there is a risk to
<br>
walking beside a road that is greater than walking elsewhere.
