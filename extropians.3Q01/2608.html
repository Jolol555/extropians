<em>&gt; &gt; IMO, your libertarian society is thereby doomed to become unfree. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problem is that the state power used to win wars is never dropped (not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entirely) once the wars are won.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a strong possibility, but only that.  It depends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the cultural strength of the people involved, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how well they understand liberty.  On two occasions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; George Washington and his immediate staff relinquished
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power (once right after the war, and once after his second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term in office).  Also, I've heard libertarians claim that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S. government actually became smaller and *less*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prone to interfere with liberty during the years 1800-1860.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But because the 18th century ideas of freedom and liberty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are so abstruse and counter-intuitive (even on this discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list sometimes), the odds of greater and greater government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control are extremely high.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this is generally so when demagogs are allowed to redefine the
<br>
terms that make up the defining contracts of a society. It has been the
<br>
lack of a glossary in the US Constitution that has been its number one
<br>
weakness, allowing terms like 'general welfare', 'interstate commerce',
<br>
'militia', 'the people', etc to be redefined by the ignorant and the
<br>
power hungry.
<br>
<p>The founding fathers also did not think enough ahead to institute
<br>
mechanisms that would act to limit the growth of government authority,
<br>
like mandating sunset clauses, term limits, as well as preventing
<br>
congressmen from being appointed to the Supreme Court, and preventing
<br>
families of civil servants from establishing bureaucratic dynasties.
<br>
This lack of foresight was inherent in the fact that the founders were
<br>
generally of agrarian extraction, with little experience in the courts
<br>
and bureaucracies of the european governments. They lacked the vision to
<br>
forsee that the US would ever rival the european powers in governmental
<br>
inertia.
