<p>An interesting hypothesis.  Let's test it.  Has anyone seen strong
<br>
anti-nanotech reactions where cryonics was never mentioned?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I tend to agree with Robert above that ultimately this is due to the

<p><em>&gt; (Of course, even most of us signed up for cryonics aren't doing anything

</em><br>
<p>I can't see how people who signed up but did not help others are more
<br>
responsible than people who did not sign up and did not help others.
