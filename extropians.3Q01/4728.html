Hi folks,
<br>
<p>Since there has been interest in the past on the topic of diets and
<br>
nutrition, I thought I would post the results/side-effects of my most recent
<br>
experiment with such things.
<br>
<p>About five weeks ago I agreed to provide &quot;morale support&quot; to one of the
<br>
girls I live with, who insisted that she needs to lose five pounds (from her
<br>
petite 115-lb body -- go figure), by doing a low carb diet with her.  I am
<br>
not in particular need of a diet, but I'm not super-lean either despite
<br>
spending much time at the gym, so I figured it would be an interesting
<br>
experiment.  My normal diet tends to be a low-fat, medium dairy, medium
<br>
protein diet with lots of carbs and vegetables.  I also attend the gym
<br>
regularly (at least for the last several months), so I also like to see how
<br>
various diets interact with my workout.  My new diet is a high-protein
<br>
high-fat diet with lots of non-starchy vegetables and water.  Note that I do
<br>
a &quot;two days on, one day off&quot; cycle for the diet; I eat plenty of quality
<br>
carbs on the off day.
<br>
<p>1)  It makes you lean with surprising speed.  I've never seen anything else
<br>
like it -- the fat just melted off my body.  This is the only diet I've ever
<br>
seen that actually produced results like this and at this speed.
<br>
<p>2)  It doesn't interfere with a heavy workout schedule.  I've tried other
<br>
low-fat diets to try to become leaner, but they all seemed to have adverse
<br>
affects on my workout scheduling, either by making recovery take longer or
<br>
just making my muscles feel lethargic (a problem I've had with
<br>
vegetarian-ish diets in general).  No problems here.
<br>
<p>3)  Dairy is bad.  This was the only change I made to the diet mid-course.
<br>
Apparently a low-carb diet aggravates the negative effects of diary in the
<br>
diet and generally didn't make me feel that good, so I cut back on them
<br>
substantially and stuck with meat and veggies.  I've always known that dairy
<br>
wasn't so hot, but this made it that much clearer.
<br>
<p>4)  No hunger.  This is more than just an issue of an empty stomach.  I
<br>
found that the time I could comfortably go between meals was greatly
<br>
extended beyond my normal diet as well.  I am guessing this has something to
<br>
do with very stable blood sugar levels.  Note that low-fat high-carb diets
<br>
always seemed to increase the frequency that I felt hungry.
<br>
<p><p>In summary, I feel great, better than I do on my normal diet.  Because of
<br>
this, it is extraordinarily easy to stick with it, and the adjustments have
<br>
been minor, particularly since every third day I eat carbs.
<br>
<p>Given the quality of the results I've had, I will probably make lean meat
<br>
and veggies my standard diet until something better comes along; my body
<br>
seems quite happy with this diet.  I'm normally skeptical of these things,
<br>
but only because most dietary changes appeared to generate adverse
<br>
consequences to my body and/or my lifestyle.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>-James Rogers
