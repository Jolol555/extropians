I had said, &quot;it sounds like the last gasps of those who don't
<br>
want to admit that once we know how to fly, the blood of
<br>
billions will be on our hands for not doing it sooner,&quot;
<br>
citing agreement with Robin.
<br>
<p>Hal commented:
<br>
<em>&gt; [Note, I don't think this is an accurate paraphrase of Robin's posting.]
</em><br>
<p>You may be right Hal, its my interpretation of Robin's
<br>
conclusion and contents of the articles.  I'm sitting here
<br>
wrestling with about 20 pages that in my mind shows a very
<br>
clear path (whether others will see it will be interesting)
<br>
so for me reading the Scientific American articles
<br>
feels like looking in a rear view mirror -- you can
<br>
see where you just came from.  All I can see in
<br>
my rear view mirror is a couple of people leaning
<br>
against a bus asserting that it isn't going to accelerate
<br>
to catch up with me.
<br>
<p>The interesting thing I'm concluding is that, at least on
<br>
the path I envision, computing power limitations do limit
<br>
the rate you can ramp nanotechnology development.  So,
<br>
while we might have accelerated it somewhat, I don't
<br>
think you could have begun to tackle the problem
<br>
back in '86 or even '81 when Eric first started saying
<br>
&quot;this is doable&quot;.  So when the final accounting gets
<br>
done, it may not be the &quot;blood of billions&quot; but merely
<br>
the &quot;blood of tens-to-hundreds of millions&quot; we will
<br>
have to explain.
<br>
<p>Robin, sorry if I misrepresented your comment.
<br>
<p>Robert
