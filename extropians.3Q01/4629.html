<em>&gt;US farm subsidies are actually quite low at the moment, only a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;billion for a multi-hundred billion dollar industry. They don't
</em><br>

<em>&gt;Absolutely, but does the US D of Ag subsidise exports? I don't know how it
</em><br>
works there but here in Europe we also have artificially high prices in
<br>
Europe itself plus subsidised selling of the resulting surplus on world
<br>
markets at below cost prices. In the case of sugar this means expensive beet
<br>
sugar from England and Belgium is sold at a very low price so efficient
<br>
producers in the West Indies or Australia are driven out of business. The
<br>
ones who gain all the way are pampered European farmers.  I know there were
<br>
big cuts in US farm subsidies a few years ago but I had heard they were
<br>
creeping back. Steve D.

<em>&gt;Yes, this does seem inequitable, unless of course you consider the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;record of third world countries in defaulting on loans, late in

<em>&gt;payments, etc. Extending credit to such countries is like giving a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;platinum card to a recovering shopaholic who lives on welfare: i.e. a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really really dumb idea.
</em><br>
<p>Unless that is you're the bank extending the credit with protection from
<br>
central banks wearing their &quot;lender of last resort hat&quot; SD

<em>&gt;

<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; For sure in my mind I don't think the IMF or the President
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; should be demanding that third world countries eliminate import tariffs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or that preferential trade relationships must be ended while the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and Europe are subsidizing agriculture to the degree that they do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Not just agriculture either - there are all sorts of barriers still in place
<br>
to prevent people in poor countries having access to markets in rich ones.
