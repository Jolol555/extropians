<p><em>&gt;Actually, IQ tests vary radically in the scores they give out. That's one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the problems with them. Mensa got around this problem by specifying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one had to score above 99% of other applicants. They have a table of which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;IQ scores on which tests will qualify. I believe the minimum acceptable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;score ranged 30-40 IQ points depending on which test was taken. Another
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem with IQ tests is that taking the same test repeatedly gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;radically different scores from day to day. The tests don't even predict
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future scores within a 10% error of margin. If anyone wants to pass an IQ
</em><br>
<em>&gt;test, just try again or try a different one.
</em><br>
<p>Without sounding redundant here, I think that IQ tests just provide a 
<br>
numerical marker that intelligent individuals can carry around in their 
<br>
heads as qualifiers of how astute they are, and how astute others should 
<br>
view them as being.  Yes, IQ is a quantifier of something, and yes, I do 
<br>
think that IQ tests are fun to take, but it is very important to 
<br>
distinguish between how someone does on a two hour-long (more or less) test 
<br>
and how someone does in an eighty year-long life.  Not a single person on 
<br>
this list will say that Richard Feynman was not a brilliant man, and the 
<br>
bearing his alleged IQ played in his life and his accomplishments is pretty 
<br>
much nil.  Likewise, I would be willing to bet that there are some members 
<br>
of this list who have an IQ around 100, and others who have an IQ twice 
<br>
that.  Big deal.
<br>
<p>If you treat IQ like the intelligence &quot;approximation&quot; it really is, then 
<br>
that's fine.  But don't think it is any more than that, because it isn't, 
<br>
and shouldn't have any bearing on how one is viewed in life.
