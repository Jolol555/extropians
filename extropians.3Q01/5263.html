<p><em>&gt; Maybe I'm missing something, but when I say I like diversity I simply mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I like living in a world where people have widely different life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; styles, interests, self-presentations, sexualities etc. I don't want to live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a world where everyone is the same. I like variety.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee seems to have expressed not so much a contrary wish to this (though that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be what he feels) as an objection to identity politics built around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these things. If that is so I have some sympathy, though I'd say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity politics is sometimes necessary for people with unpopular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characteristics to pursue more tolerance, better legal rights etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you clarify what you don't like, Lee? Is it a variety of different kinds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of people? Or is it the (sometimes necessary, I would say) evil of identity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politics?
</em><br>
<p>I dislike individuals being replaced, in effect, by groups.  Now the
<br>
groups may indeed arise from history and geography, and what not, and
<br>
be real.  But it's false for people to identify with their group at
<br>
the expense of seeing themselves and feeling themselves to be 
<br>
individuals.  Identity *politics* is only a part, but an important
<br>
part, of this.
<br>
<p>When I was 18, I was running a junior chess program for the city.
<br>
An eleven year old suddenly asked me, &quot;Are you Catholic?&quot;.  When
<br>
I answered &quot;No&quot; I could see that a little barrier had sprung up
<br>
between us.  That's one aspect.  But until we control the genes
<br>
that determine racial groupings, we're helpless against the 
<br>
divisions that naturally arise, say, between whites and blacks.
<br>
<p>The diversity that you are speaking of---which is not what people
<br>
are usually meaning when they use the term---&quot;people have widely
<br>
different life styles, interests, self-presentations, sexualities etc.&quot;
<br>
is fairly harmless.  But what is the use of cultural diversity,
<br>
for example?  None.  So far as I can tell, it limits people, and
<br>
allows them and others to pigeonhole, and fosters divisiveness.
<br>
<p>Lee
