<p><em>&gt; From the capitalist point of view, hard drives are an easier way to make

<p>Hmmm... I don't wanna start a major war here. :-/
<br>
<p>I have the greatest respect for you Reason, and love the good sense in most 
<br>
of what you write...
<br>
<p>I just think it is a little rash of you to say that. Profit motive sees 
<br>
much more &quot;sense&quot; in promoting expensive medical maintenance programs that 
<br>
keep people on medications for the rest of their lives. Medical companies 
<br>
don't like to spend money on researching ways to prevent or cure ills. That 
<br>
cuts out their market.
<br>
<p>Many of the great success stories in clobbering diseases are publicly 
<br>
funded. They drive such things as health and sanitation education, and 
<br>
vaccination programs. Of course these then provide the market and incentive 
<br>
for corporations to refine and supply the vaccines, etc. Both sides 
<br>
(capitalist and publicly funded organisations) need each other to create a 
<br>
balanced environment.
<br>
<p>If we had just capitalism managing medicine then we would see incredibly 
<br>
expensive medicine that would serve the rich (that's where the money is), 
<br>
but not much else.
<br>
<p>If we had only publicly managed medicine then we would see medicine ossify 
<br>
and become more and more entrenched in tradition.
<br>
<p>Neither is the whole solution. Diversity, as in most things, is important.
<br>
<p>I worry when the economic rationalist religion is propagated as the 
<br>
ultimate truth. It isn't. The world just isn't that simple.
<br>
<p>Did you know that many people who travel to USA worry about getting ill 
<br>
while over there and accruing massive and crippling medical bills for 
<br>
treatment that in Australia or UK or Europe would be relatively 
<br>
inconsequential? Your medical system is heavily privatised and the most 
<br>
expensive on the planet.
<br>
<p>Don't get me wrong. I am not saying the US medical system is crap. It has 
<br>
its uses -- its advantages and disadvantages... but that doesn't make it 
<br>
better than other systems. In fact American medicine is becoming irrelevant 
<br>
to large parts of its own society thru its inability to attend to the needs 
<br>
of the great numbers of poor.
<br>
<p>Darn... I have this horrible, sinking feeling I have just started a 
<br>
patriotic, capitalist, flame war... oops.  :-)
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
