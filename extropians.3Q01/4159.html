<p>Hey, I used WordStar under CP/M waay back in 1980- now let's all sing a
<br>
round of &quot;When I Was a Boy&quot;
<br>
<p>When I Was A Boy
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright © 1997 by Frank Hayes,
<br>
&nbsp;Firebird Arts &amp; Music (BMI)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;When I was a boy our Nintendo
<br>
&nbsp;Was carved from an old Apple tree
<br>
&nbsp;And we used garden hose to connect it
<br>
&nbsp;To our steam-powered color tv. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;But it still beat that ancient Atari
<br>
&nbsp;'Cuz I almost went blind, don'tcha know,
<br>
&nbsp;Playing Breakout and Pong on a video game
<br>
&nbsp;Hooked up to the radio.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;And we walked twenty miles to the schoolhouse
<br>
&nbsp;Barefoot, uphill both ways,
<br>
&nbsp;Through blizzards in summer and winter
<br>
&nbsp;Back in the good old days.
<br>
&nbsp;Back when Fortran was not even Three-tran
<br>
&nbsp;And the PC was only a toy
<br>
&nbsp;And we did our computing by gaslight
<br>
&nbsp;When I was a boy.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;When I was a boy all our networks
<br>
&nbsp;Were for hauling in fish from the sea--
<br>
&nbsp;Our bawd rate was eight bits an hour (and she was worth it!),
<br>
&nbsp;And our IP address was just 3.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;And you kids who complain that the World Wide Web
<br>
&nbsp;Is too slow oughtta cut out your bitchin',
<br>
&nbsp;'Cuz when I was a boy every packet
<br>
&nbsp;Was delivered by carrier pigeon
<br>
<p>&nbsp;And we walked twenty miles to the schoolhouse
<br>
&nbsp;Barefoot, uphill both ways,
<br>
&nbsp;Through blizzards in summer and winter
<br>
&nbsp;Back in the good old days.
<br>
&nbsp;Back when Fortran was not even Two-tran
<br>
&nbsp;And the mainframe was only a toy
<br>
&nbsp;And we did our computing by torchlight
<br>
&nbsp;When I was a boy.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;When I was a boy our IS shop
<br>
&nbsp;Built relational tables from wood,
<br>
&nbsp;And we wrappered our data in oilcloth
<br>
&nbsp;To preserve it the best that we could.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;And we carried our bits in a bucket,
<br>
&nbsp;And our mainframe weighed 900 tons,
<br>
&nbsp;And we programmed in ones and in zeros
<br>
&nbsp;And sometimes we ran out of ones.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;And we walked twenty miles to the schoolhouse
<br>
&nbsp;Barefoot, uphill both ways,
<br>
&nbsp;Through blizzards in summer and winter
<br>
&nbsp;Back in the good old days.
<br>
&nbsp;Back when Fortran was not even One-tran
<br>
&nbsp;And the abacus? Only a toy!
<br>
&nbsp;And we did our computing in primordial darkness
<br>
&nbsp;When I was a boy.
