I have a friend who is delighted every time that the door bell
<br>
rings.  One can only be reminded by the phrase ' &quot;Come in! Come in!&quot;,
<br>
said the spider to the fly'.  He sits them down and with his rather
<br>
unequaled knowledge of the bible proceeds in the most eminently
<br>
polite and serious manner possible to lay out contradiction upon
<br>
contradiction, cruelties, and simply unbelieveable incidents all
<br>
in the manner of someone who simply wants to know the truth.  And
<br>
the latter is no lie---my friend Spencer indeed believes that &quot;the
<br>
truth&quot; is his religion.
<br>
<p>I used to imitate him for a time, but I have neither his encyclopediac
<br>
knowledge nor his infinite patience, though I do have a couple of 
<br>
amusing stories that I should share some time.
<br>

<br>
<p>P.S.  Loved the quip by someone that he had taken too much LDS
<br>
during the sixties---whether that was an intentional joke or typo!!

<em>&gt; Hahahaha! Hahahha.  Michael you are very funny!  John, thanks for sharing!

<em>&gt; The thing is, for me anyway, this piece is so darn visual.

<em>&gt; &gt;I got a kick out of reading what Natasha shared.  It was like a simplistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; version of my old missionary training manual.  Now, that was a very thick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volume which contained the wisdom and experience of the church missionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Mike Lorrey shared:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Good one, Natasha. I've developed countermeasures to &gt;these over time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;As a returned missionary for the LDS church, I am very familiar with all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such tactics! ;)  You are a kind man compared to some folks who actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threatened me with fisticuffs or even guns.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;a) having a VERY friendly and noisy dog helps keep &gt;them outside. I just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; open the door wide enough to &gt;stick my head out. The yapping dog keeps them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from &gt;wanting to venture further.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Big, barking dogs work very well.  Although, I had one missionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companion who could somehow charm dogs(and he was big too) and the owners
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would look so disappointedly at their pets as we made it to the door! lol  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;b) I say, 'Hey, brothers, have you guys been biking &gt;all over town in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those shirts and ties ALL DAY? You &gt;must be REALLY HOT and TIRED,&quot; all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while not making &gt;any effort to offer refreshments (it's okay if I sip m
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;own soda).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Such emotional cruelty! lol  I remember tracting in southern Louisiana at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the start of my mission and at times thinking I might pass out from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humid heat.  I nearly quit the whole affair due to the climate but the body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adapts over time.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I remember women who would open the door and give us cold pop to drink.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They would make it plain they were not interested, but wanted to show us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some kindness.  To this day I am grateful to them.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;c) I ask them what they are here for.  If they are &gt;mormons, I mention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fact that Joseph Smith was &gt;once laid up over across the river in South
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Royalton &gt;with a broken leg once, he broke it on one of his &gt;many drunken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sprees, carousing around the town. I &gt;mention that some families still keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; account of the &gt;bills old Joe skipped out on when he left town and &gt;ask if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Church ever paid those up...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Have you heard how Joseph Smith as a teenager refused whisky to soften the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain when he needed surgery to remove a bone infection?  Instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drinking, he had his father hold him down.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Since they are usually some kind of christians, I &gt;usually ask them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolve some theological &gt;paradoxes for me. I think next time I'll ask them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;about the topological properties of hell and whether &gt;angels dancing on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pins can be considered quantum &gt;objects...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I need to remember that the next time the Jehovah's Witness's come to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; door!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;d) When they ask me about my own faith, I say I don't &gt;need any faith,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;cause I KNOW-uh, the TRUTH-uh!&quot; and &gt;go off on Theilhard des Chardins and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Omega Point &gt;Theory and bring in the technologies of the &gt;singularity... by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this point in time, if they haven't &gt;already, they've figured out I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either completely &gt;nuts, posessed of the devil, or had too much &quot;LDS in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the 60's&quot;....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I could just imagine a &quot;rip in time&quot; where you meet a young Elder Brent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Allsop!  Twilight zone music please...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Having too much &quot;LDS&quot; can be quite the experience!  I have found it very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; habit-forming.  It can definitely work well in getting a quality mate.
