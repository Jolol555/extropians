<p>Yes, permanganate, chlorate or perchlorate based mixes, especially with

finely dispersed metals (magnesium, aluminum), plus some red phosphorus or

organics, would do very nicely.

<p>Organic peroxides (acetone peroxide) can be remarkably nasty, especially
<br>
since they tend to detonate spontaneously at little or no provocation.
<br>
Also, they're frequently volatile, allowing you to identify them via GC/MS
<br>
route, if improperly packaged.

<p>Of course, the screening is useful against your garden-variety terrorist,

which has little clue about explosive chemistry, or detection techniques.
