</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Question: What would you propose?
</em><br>
<p>Oil will continue to be favored as long as it's far cheaper to use.  Given 
<br>
the 
<br>
staggering investments already into finding alternative energy sources, the
<br>
chance of any pet project replacing oil is next to nil.  So the only solution
<br>
is to tax oil and natural gas heavily, to the point where imports aren't 
<br>
necessary.  I don't know the numbers, but I'd guesstimate 3-4 dollars
<br>
per gallon of gas equivalent would do the trick.  Most adjustments to reduce 
<br>
oil consumption, such as car gas mileage, transportation arrangements, and 
<br>
siting decisions, have long lead times, so the taxes should be imposed 
<br>
gradually. 
<br>
Again, it would be complex to balance disruption vs. independence, but offhand
<br>
I'd say over 10 years, which covers a car's useful cycle.  So the guideline is
<br>
to raise taxes on oil and gas until imports start, with a rough estimate of 
<br>
35 cents per gallon of gas equivalent until imports stop.  10 years would also
<br>
give enough to time to replace oil-burning power plants with whatever works
<br>
best.
<br>
<p>This doesn't fix Europe and Japan, of course, but changing how they live is
<br>
not in the control of the US gov't, and I'm supposed to be making 
<br>
recommendations
<br>
to W.
