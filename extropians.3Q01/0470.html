</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it's a derivative work, you'll need my permission. Admittedly, it's sometimes tricky to determince wheter it's a derivative work or not. It's an sliding scale, it depends on the amount of information, or rather complexity of the work involved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>How does this apply to scientific, mathematical or algorithmic
<br>
(software) discoveries and creations though?  There are some
<br>
things that the above &quot;common sense&quot; is not applied to today. 
<br>
Software is somewhere on the borderline.  I helieve it should
<br>
fall or most advantageously should fall within the realm of
<br>
scientific and matehmatical discovery and works.  So, if someone
<br>
builds on a softare component I have designed and built I do not
<br>
see that they need to ask my permission before doing so.   I do
<br>
believe I should be able to prohibit them absconding with my
<br>
work in such a way that it is no longer available freely to
<br>
others to build on.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Alex F. Bokov again:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Certainly. I'd respect inherently *uncopyable* software far more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;software that somebody else's ethics or laws presume to restrict me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;from copying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you have an online bank account? If it's possible to break in to that, would it be ethical? Should it be legal?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>All analogies are fundamentally worthless when it comes to
<br>
software. Including the ones I employ. &lt;g&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;That said, I will believe it when I see it. Users can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;capture streaming content; they can use debuggers and disassemblers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;crack any password or serial number; they can then use p2p networks or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;anonymous online space to share the 'liberated' software.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes I agree, there will always be harmful petty &quot;thievs&quot; thinkering with such things for fun. Then there are &quot;commercial&quot; pirates that duplicates anything that sell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Using the laws of physics and the theorems of mathematics is not
<br>
thievery.  Neither is using the software algorithsm discovered
<br>
by others.
