Stranger than fiction 
<br>
<p>Are 12ft lizards running the world? Louis Theroux investigates Them:
<br>
Adventures with Extremists by Jon Ronson
<br>
<p>Saturday April 7, 2001
<br>
The Guardian
<br>
<p>Them: Adventures with Extremists
<br>
Jon Ronson
<br>
352pp, Picador, £16.99
<br>
<p>There is a version of history that holds that the world is secretly run by a
<br>
shadowy cabal of predominantly Jewish international financiers and
<br>
politicians who meet several times a year to decide which wars to start,
<br>
which countries to bankrupt, which gun-owners to oppress, and so on. This
<br>
view, which has been around at least since the late 19th century, when it
<br>
was popularised in a hugely influential piece of anti-semitic propaganda,
<br>
The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , exists in various versions - with
<br>
&quot;Jews&quot; occasionally being replaced by &quot;Bilderbergers&quot;, &quot;New World Order&quot;,
<br>
&quot;Illuminati&quot; or &quot;12ft lizard creatures&quot;. Though undoubtedly nutty, its
<br>
paranoid and exciting &quot;top secret&quot; flavour has meant it continues to appeal
<br>
to a motley crew of self-styled &quot;researchers&quot; and evangelists on the fringes
<br>
of society, including Ku Klux Klansmen, militias, certain fundamentalist
<br>
Muslims and an ex-Coventry goalkeeper called David Icke.
<br>
For Them: Adventures with Extremists , reporter and documentary film-maker
<br>
Jon Ronson spent several years in the company of a few of these
<br>
fringe-dwellers, in an attempt to understand their mindset and to see to
<br>
what - if any - extent their fears were founded in fact. The resulting book
<br>
is a funny and compulsively readable picaresque adventure through a paranoid
<br>
shadow world, with Ronson playing Sancho Panza to a cast of obsessives.
<br>
Ronson has a deft, ironic touch and a brilliant way with scene-setting and
<br>
direct speech - much of the action is so neat and pacy it reads almost like
<br>
a novel - and it is one of the book's great merits that it never takes
<br>
itself too seriously. Conspiracy investigators tend to be incompetent and
<br>
petty in direct proportion to the delusional grandeur of their ambitions,
<br>
something Ronson is not slow to pick up on. &quot;I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO!&quot; one
<br>
investigator screams at his colleague. &quot;Make a big show of shouting down the
<br>
phone! Steal the limelight! And then Jon will write about you !&quot;
<br>
In one of the book's funniest chapters, Ronson accompanies an
<br>
ultra-right-wing conspiracy investigator named Big Jim Tucker as he attempts
<br>
to infiltrate a meeting of the Bilderberg Group (a semi-secret council of
<br>
international industrialists and statesmen, and a favourite bugbear of the
<br>
paranoid fringe). They end up being chased by scary-looking security
<br>
personnel in dark glasses and Ronson panics, trying to get the British
<br>
Embassy to rescue him. &quot;I am essentially a humorous journalist,&quot; he pleads
<br>
down the phone. &quot;I am a humorous journalist out of my depth.&quot;
<br>
But Ronson also has a point to make about the way beliefs in general tend to
<br>
demonise &quot;them&quot;, where &quot;them&quot; might be diabolical Jews, 12ft lizards, or
<br>
indeed the weirdos who believe in diabolical Jews and 12ft lizards. Exhibit
<br>
A in the fringe-dwellers' case for the existence of a shadowy all-powerful
<br>
cabal is the true-life story of the Weavers, a family with admittedly
<br>
far-out religious views who, yes, consorted with neo-Nazis and who moved to
<br>
the remotest corner of northern Idaho to be as far as possible from the
<br>
&quot;Zionist Occupational Government&quot;. Vicki Weaver and her son Sammy were shot
<br>
in cold blood by federal marshals in a paramilitary-style raid. Conspiracy
<br>
theorists have ever since argued that this is proof that the world is indeed
<br>
run by a secret oligarchy; Ronson's compelling case is that what happened
<br>
was made possible because the Weavers were repeatedly described in the media
<br>
as &quot;white supremacists&quot; and therefore in some way worthy of extermination.
<br>
Another chapter examines the strange history of David Icke, the footballer
<br>
turned BBC commentator turned Green Party spokesman turned self-proclaimed
<br>
son of God. Ronson finds Icke on a lecture tour of Canada, pursuing his new
<br>
calling as an investigator of the secret elite of lizard shape-shifters (the
<br>
Queen and Ted Heath are among those under suspicion) who run the world.
<br>
Icke's &quot;theory&quot; is basically The Protocols of the Elders of Zion with a new
<br>
cast and a few script changes. Not surprisingly, Icke has come under
<br>
suspicion of anti-semitism; as his tour progresses he finds his readings
<br>
heavily picketed and his radio interviews cancelled. Icke vehemently
<br>
repudiates the accusations, and reading Ronson's account it is difficult not
<br>
to conclude that, while we are right to be on our guard against paranoid
<br>
anti-semitism, we should also be on our guard against the paranoid excesses
<br>
of anti-anti-semitism. Not only might it be unfair to Icke, but by implying
<br>
that he is so dangerous that he has to be censored, the watchdogs are giving
<br>
a patina of seriousness to ideas that are - let's face it - very, very
<br>
silly.
<br>
As the book progresses, what emerges is the degree to which the real-life
<br>
Bilderberg Group and the researchers who campaign against it are negatives
<br>
of each other. Intentionally or not, the alleged bodies of world domination
<br>
do create suspicion and resentment with their cloak-and-dagger mentality,
<br>
their self-importance and their alarmism. It is no surprise to learn that
<br>
some Bilderbergers quite like the idea that they are secretly running the
<br>
world: it flatters their vanity. Towards the end of his investigation,
<br>
Ronson finds himself referred to approvingly on the internet and in
<br>
underground newspapers by fringe researchers and New World Order believers.
<br>
He suggests he has passed through the looking glass and is now &quot;one of
<br>
them&quot;. I think this is going a little far. If pressed, and for all its
<br>
flaws, I'd say I'm on the side of the existing international
<br>
liberal-democratic system and against the notion that lizards might be
<br>
running the world, and I suspect Ronson feels the same way. Still, it is to
<br>
his great credit that he's given &quot;them&quot; such a fair-minded - and
<br>
entertaining - evaluation.
