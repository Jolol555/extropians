You found a nice list of flaws.  I agree, they do need to be addressed.

<br>
<em>&gt; 1) Information Asymmetry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Assuming that they know everything we know, but we know nothing about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what they know except they know what we know.  In such a case, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other party may had discovered something we had not, for instance, by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance (such as computer bugs) they discovered a major advance in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotech.  They could use this knowledge against us, even if we had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upgraded our infrastructure because we may have too much bad luck and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miss this discovery, even if only for a week.
</em><br>
<p>The best potential counter I can immediately see is to simply be more
<br>
effective at using what knowledge we gain than they are - the classic
<br>
&quot;small group turns on a dime, large group suffers from inertia&quot;.
<br>
Possibly this takes the form of concrete examples that we can make
<br>
available to our citizens, and documentation that we can read and
<br>
maintain but which - even if copied by enemy spies - would take a long
<br>
time to distribute and drill into all their minds.  This is more
<br>
effective if we, as a society, were to embrace these kinds of changes
<br>
and build to allow them, thus allowing rapid retrofitting of our
<br>
infrastructure far faster than our enemies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) Information Discovery Difficulty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It definitely takes more effort to discover something than to copy it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from others.  Allowing spies into our midst will merely allow larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military budgets at the expense of (now redundant) research budgets.
</em><br>
<p>If they depend on us for R&amp;D, they won't be able to attack us - we'll
<br>
be too valuable as is.  And more to the point, our military would be
<br>
structured around tech advantages, with the acknowledgement that we
<br>
would be outspent by any enemy; 15 times or 16 times becomes less of an
<br>
issue in that case.  It's analogous to the current situation with US
<br>
military vs. Chinese military: China has far more soldiers, but the US
<br>
could easily repel an all-out invasion with few casualties even if
<br>
China and the US shared a land border.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) Information Utility Reduction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once we know enough about something (depending on the complexity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the subject matter), the amount of additional information and its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utility will decrease.  This means that, once they know enough, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would need exponentially more knowledge to stop them.
</em><br>
<p>Knowledge increasing at an exponential rate would be part of the point
<br>
of the colony - though, by the time the exponent got really high, the
<br>
absolute tech difference would probably be large enough for this not to
<br>
matter.  The best defense here in the early years is simply to open up
<br>
a whole bunch of new fields of research and pursue them to the point of
<br>
rapid payoffs...which would be part of the point of the colony anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How do we know whom to attack in retaliation?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, refusing to retaliate will probably work wonders as far as
<br>
convincing most of the world not to attack (or keep attacking) us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4) Information as Goods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The last point, and perhaps most important one, lies with our ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to trade information.  We can make a pact with planet Earth to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exchange our technology with something else.  We can make something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful we discovered very tough to reverse engineer, and sell it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.  Perhaps we can even sell weapons to them so that they will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know better than to attack us.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, if we're in space anyway, asteroid mining would probably be a
<br>
simpler (and higher rate of return, at least at first) way to get
<br>
funds.  Once we automate the process, pulling down tons of metals and
<br>
other valuables would simply be a matter of building and launching
<br>
another robot, waiting for the robot to fetch and process the rock
<br>
(during which time we do our research, possibly with a few of us
<br>
selecting the next asteroid to bring down), deciding what mass we
<br>
wanted to keep for the station and what we wanted to sell, then selling
<br>
parts of the rock and air-dropping them to the buyers' locations.
<br>
<p>Lots of money (mainly useful to buy what we don't wish to build
<br>
ourselves from the kept rock pieces), and no worries about IP.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But at the same time, we should be willing to assign the same space to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any other habitat...which puts a limit on how much territory we may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; safely claim.  If we orbit opposite Earth, and claim a 1 AU radius
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sphere...what if someone puts a colony 1/6th of an orbit ahead of us?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's far enough away to be nonthreatening, yet clearly within our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; space, to say nothing of us being in their space.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not true.  We must consider the argument about information trading as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above.  Finder's keepers, and if you don't grab the space, someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else will and they will put lots of weaponry to keep it when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think you need a little more space since you only grab such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonably small slice.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;shrugs&gt;  What's to keep them from grabbing the space after we claimed
<br>
it anyway?  They will be less likely to if we only claim what we can
<br>
defend.  OTOH, claiming an unreasonably (to others) large slice will
<br>
directly result in others being less likely to honor our claims.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Hopefully, this would make little difference.  In practice, though,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; instilling that form of loyalty might well guard against corruption -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; say, if some hostile power somehow managed to get a &quot;let's blow up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; colony and all head back to Earth to be sheep again&quot; type elected to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whatever government we have.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; If you want to go back and join the herd, then by all means go ahead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would seem highly irrational to having to fight an entire colony
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you could simply walk out of the airlock into your spaceship and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show the moon to everyone else who chooses to stay.
</em><br>
<p>You seem to have slightly misunderstood my point here.  In any
<br>
society, there will be some societal conditioning (norms, commonly
<br>
held beliefs that sometimes get coded into law, et cetera).  I'm
<br>
saying, shape those beliefs so that no one would want to go back.
<br>
Though, you're right, keeping the option to return open will take a
<br>
large part of the pressure off, especially in the likelihood that any
<br>
acutal implementation of this has some error.
