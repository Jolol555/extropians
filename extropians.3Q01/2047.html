</em><br>
<p>There is pot and then there is pot. Most recreational pot is not only
<br>
high in THC, but also in CBD, which is the sedative component which
<br>
suppresses the edginess and paranoia that THC products. Low CBD pot in
<br>
tests with martial artists has been shown to be a very good performance
<br>
enhancer that increased agression, strength, and focus. There was a very
<br>
good program the other night on the History Channel that examined the
<br>
drugs given to warriors in the Zulu army during their war with the
<br>
British in the 19th century. Along with this low CBD pot, there was an
<br>
extract of a bulb root that works in reducing pain, and a mushroom that
<br>
induces a red tinged fury.
<br>
<p>This essentially confirmed information I had been given by a
<br>
shaman/naturopath while at the Rainbow Gathering this past year. If this
<br>
sort of information is that widespread, I expect that those interested
<br>
in maximizing the efficacy of protesters in the face of martially
<br>
superior police force would utilize similar techniques. How do you know
<br>
WHAT they put in the kook-aid?
<br>
<p>I imagine that some may use heroin as a pain supressant to deal with
<br>
police beatings better, but in too high a dose it is just too disabling.
