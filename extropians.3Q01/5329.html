Mike Lorrey write,
<br>
<em>&gt; Well, you quoted him saying 'the Creator', which could be anything, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that irrespective of his own religious views, he said this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically to appeal to those who may have other opinions of who the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'creator' is.
</em><br>
<p>My point exactly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't think Heston implying that whites deserve more credit for US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; civilization than blacks, native Americans, etc.  You are reading some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; implications even farther than I would have imagined.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What he was asking is why blacks are given so much more of a prominent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place in current history books than whites like George Washington and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thomas Jefferson. I think that he was trying to show that excluding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; founding fathers is at least as unjust as excluding later civil rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaders, and that all should be represented in history books
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proportionate to their actual contribution to the history of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country.
</em><br>
<p>Again, you may be right, but the speech does not get into these areas
<br>
specifically.  You are extrapolating all of this from the signals in the
<br>
speech.  You can't find this stuff in Heston's actual words.  That is my
<br>
point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; That's why I make it clear that hate-crime laws are NOT an example of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equal-rights laws.  They do not have the same purpose or effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, they ARE equal rights laws. They are intended to eliminate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unequal living conditions that minorities are subjected to by bigots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through harassment. Just why they are needed when ordinary harassment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws have worked for the rest of us is beyond me.
</em><br>
<p>OK, you can call these equal-rights laws if you want.  However, that makes
<br>
two kinds of equal rights laws.  Those that try to enforce &quot;equal rights&quot;
<br>
for &quot;all&quot; and those that try to enforce &quot;special rights&quot; for &quot;some&quot;.  These
<br>
are not the same thing.  What I call real equal rights laws do the former,
<br>
whereas hate-crime laws do the latter.
<br>
<p>My previous statements were meant to support the former laws.  Your
<br>
statements were meant to criticize the latter laws.  We are not really in
<br>
disagreement on this point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The reason why we can and do make the comparison, Harvey, is because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primary gun control law in this country, the Gun Control Act of 1968,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been documented (by a Jewish gun-rights group) to have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purposely translated from the 1938 revised National Weapons Law of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Germany which was used to disarm the Jews, and put into effect here by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Democrat Senator Thomas Dodd. We can compare ourselves to jews because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are living under anti-semitic originated laws right now.
</em><br>
<p>I will concede the question of whether gun-owners are suffering as much as
<br>
Jews under the Holocaust to your expertise.  My point is that this is a
<br>
meme-killer not a meme-supporter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So you think it is alright for HIV carriers to willfully expose others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the virus without telling them? Excuse me? Maybe you misunderstood my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original statement
</em><br>
<p>No, I was not clear.  I do NOT support withholding information in situations
<br>
that have been proven to be communicable.  I do not even support withholding
<br>
information in situations that have not been so proven.  The individual must
<br>
make decisions for their own health based on their doctor's advice.  The
<br>
doctor must not withhold information to lead the patient to a decision which
<br>
would be contrary to their own will.  (People have the right to make their
<br>
own decisions.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That Heston is drawing attention to a situation that he feels is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unjust one is irrelevant to his own implied opinion about it. It doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter if different people have different opinions about how important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or severe this situation is, so long as they see it as unjust as well.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  My fear is that Heston's speech gains support against certain
<br>
situations without clearly defining Heston's position or the proposed
<br>
action.  He merely gives examples and says &quot;Let's fix it!&quot;  Everybody agrees
<br>
to fix problems, but the devil is in the details.  Nothing in Heston's
<br>
speech defines the problems, outlines a solution, or obtains consensus.  Eve
<br>
rybody in the audience &quot;agrees&quot;, but it is not clear what they agree to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What expiration date do you put on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having a status as 'original Africans'??? We are all African if you go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far back enough (even native Americans are). So what date do you decide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determines what one's 'Africanness' is? Jews lived in Egypt for hundreds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of years, and later migrated all over europe, asia, and africa. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nearly impossible for a person of european extraction to have absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no jewish blood in them, so therefore most europeans can be found to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have African ancestry that is less than 3000 years old. Even later, many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Italians, Greeks, Albanians, Spaniards, etc have african blood that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dates only back to the Moorish conquests of the middle ages.
</em><br>
<p>I think you misunderstood my position to be arguing for the use of these
<br>
labels.  I am not.  I was concerned that Heston seemed to insist on calling
<br>
blacks &quot;negros&quot; even if they disliked the term.  This attitude bothers me,
<br>
but I was not endorsing the politically-correct hyphenated terms.  I think
<br>
anybody should be able to call themselves what they want.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, what about africans who never lived here in the US under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slavery or Jim Crow, who are only recent immigrants whose families never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffered from American prejudice (merely the even greater tribal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prejudices of their homeland in africa. Why should they enjoy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferential treatment under affirmative action when their families
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never suffered the injustices of slavery here?
</em><br>
<p>Why ask me?  I never endorsed this idea.  You are assuming that if I'm not
<br>
on &quot;your&quot; side that I must be on the &quot;other&quot; side, and are therefore making
<br>
a whole bunch of invalid assumptions about my position.  I don't support
<br>
half the ideas you seem to be projecting onto me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Since you've decided that 'white' is bad, what about 'european'?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Where did you get the idea that I think &quot;white&quot; is bad?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You said that using the term 'white' is as racist as using the term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'black' instead of 'African-American'
</em><br>
<p>I see what you mean.  I thought you meant I claimed that white people were
<br>
&quot;bad&quot;.
<br>
<p>I think classifying people by skin color is a bad idea.  I don't mind the
<br>
terms black or white, and I use the terms myself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Heston is not talking about committing violent crimes against innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people. Rappers are. End of story.
</em><br>
<p>I know.  I never implied that Heston was condoning violence.  I do think he
<br>
condones suppressing rapper music.  Maybe only in the context of
<br>
stock-holders, and maybe only in certain circumstances.  I just found the
<br>
juxtaposition of stopping rap music with free speech to be awkward.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Agreed.  But he has a definite call to action at the end of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speech.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; calls for civil disobedience and for people to &quot;act&quot; when these kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things occur.  Now he doesn't specify what exact acts should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it is clear that some kind of action is being requested.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course. And is this wrong?
</em><br>
<p>Nope.  But it is imprecise.  I am worried about any call to action that
<br>
leaves the &quot;problem&quot; and the &quot;solution&quot; up to the audience, and just
<br>
identifies the problem &quot;groups&quot;.  Maybe Heston doesn't mean anything bad
<br>
about this, but somebody is going to misunderstand such a message and think
<br>
they need to &quot;do something&quot; about those blacks, Jews and gays.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why is it that unjust laws are to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resisted unless they are unjust toward white males?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know.  Why do you keep asking me these kinds of questions?  You seem
<br>
to have a whole liberal agenda projected onto me that I really don't
<br>
support.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; His point is that the government is forcing people by statute,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jack-boot, and expenditure of taxpayer dollars, to act in ways contrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to their values, and to punish people for their beliefs with their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money. His point is that the injustice of a minority of rich white males
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upon the rest of society in the past does not justify the injustice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today by a majority of blacks, women, poor people, and other formerly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disadvantaged groups. Our country was structured in such a way as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protect the rights of the individual against the tyranny of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority, but that tyranny is exactly what is occurring today, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prettied up 'code words' for revenge like 'affirmative action',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'set-asides', and 'racial quotas'.
</em><br>
<p>Again, none of this is in Heston's speech.  You are assuming that this is
<br>
what he meant.  You also are assuming what should be done about this stuff.
<br>
I think that KKK members would make more dangerous assumptions.
