<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;You neglect the impact of  economies of scale. Right now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there isnt much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;an impact, but if all schools were private, the situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would be quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;pronounced. Besides, theres no studies that show a difference in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;of education declining if classroom sizes increase from say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 30 to 50. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;sounds like there should be, but it reality, if you have 30
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; students, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;dont have a lot of time with individual students anyways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Double the size
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;the class and you can drop prices dramatically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Let me be sure I have this straight...  You are suggesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; getting rid of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (free) public school where the student:teacher ratio is ~
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 30:1 and having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; every family pay $2K - $5K per year (per kid) for a school where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; student:teacher ratio is 50:1?  Is that *really* what you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suggesting, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; am I missing something?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; -Zero
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm suggesting getting rid of public schools for private and letting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;private school decide how to do its job. If you dont like a low cost, high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;volume school, dont go to it. You'll have a choice to go where ever you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and can afford. Its the same point as to why it cost more now to hire a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;private full time tutor then go to private school. If you want to be cheap,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;send your kid to the K-mart version (as if those types of schools didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already exist). I would expect the norm classroom size to stay about where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is and the cost of doing it to drop a good chunk with private industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doing it. Your choice here is McDonalds Hamburgers, eating at nice dinner 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Chilis retaurant, or Filet Mingon from an expensive restaurant. All options
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be available!
</em><br>
<p>Of course the only real options would be available to the wealthy.  The rest 
<br>
of us would be relegated to sending our kids to the $.99 Store school.  I 
<br>
know that to some it seems only right that only the rich are entitled first 
<br>
rate educations for their kids.  To me, that just doesn't sit right.
<br>
<p>The simple fact is that a welfare mother is not likely to be able to afford 
<br>
to pay *anything* to educate her children.  If public education is abandoned 
<br>
the only alternative for the truly poor would be the school of hard knocks.  
<br>
Again, that's the equivolent of saying &quot;let them eat cake.&quot;  Woe to all of 
<br>
us if/when that day ever comes.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
