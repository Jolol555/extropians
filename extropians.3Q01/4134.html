Zero Powers hits with:
<br>
<em>&gt; Individuals, as much as they hate to believe it, already are about as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transparent as they can be.  The only &quot;persons&quot; who enjoy any semblance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real privacy anymore are corporate and government institutions.  
</em><br>
<p>Agree, more or less. Is &quot;Privacy&quot; nothing more than code for the phrase 
<br>
&quot;Security by obscurity&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transparency will be more of a benefit than a detriment to individuals.
</em><br>
<p>_Could_ be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am a patient man.  Eventually the value of transparency will make itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known and, although I'm not the type to say &quot;I told you so,&quot; you'll know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll be thinking it ;)
</em><br>
<p>only if you man the parapets to make the sauce for the gander, as it were.
<br>
<p>Our (plain folks') goose, OTOH--well, you-all stick a fork in it and tell me.
<br>
<p>MMB, remembering the food beast from Hitchhiker's Guide... 
<br>
&quot;I've been force-feeding myself for several weeks now...&quot;
