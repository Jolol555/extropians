<em>&gt; Well, there have been a few terrorist deeds. But most of them have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aimed at other nations, such as the murder of the Yugoslaw ambassador
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the destruction of the German embassy in the 70's. Of course, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assassination of prime minister Olof Palme might have been a serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorist deed.
</em><br>
<p>In recent years, the number of attacks on the US has increased from Beruit
<br>
to this Tuesday's attacks.  I don't think this disproves the
<br>
US-foreign-policy-is-a-causative-factor thesis, but renforces.  However,
<br>
this cause does not act alone.  This Tuesday's attacks needed more than that
<br>
to come about, such as a level of training, coordination, and dedication
<br>
that takes a long time to put together.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is another reason for such attacks on the US, and that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antiamericanism. It might appear absurd to many on this list, but there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are plenty of people who are deeply suspicious and prejudiced against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US worldwide - including highly educated intellectuals.
</em><br>
<p>This is true and many of them are educated here in the US!
<br>
<p>It's disgusting, too, to see many intellectuals in other countries spouting
<br>
violent rhetoric.  You would hope that people whose life is of the mind
<br>
would think more along the lines of reason not force.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; course envy. Another part is the western sympathy for David versus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Goliath - the underdog is always the hero, the giant is never the hero:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since the US is a giant, it can't be good. All these things combine to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make prejudices against americans acceptable like no other prejudices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and biases the media - which reinforces the antiamericanism.
</em><br>
<p>The Davy vs. Goliath pattern here is very pereceptive.  I've read elsewhere
<br>
that some of the double agents in America -- CIA spies who are actually
<br>
aiding a rival power -- often justify their work when caught by some notion
<br>
of fairness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While an isolationist policy might earn the US a few brownie points in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many eyes, it wouldn't be enough. Especially if you factor in people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have long memories and still want a revenge for what happened to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forefathers.
</em><br>
<p>But those people will find it harder and harder to recruit the youth.  Plus,
<br>
the US could then focus on defending itself -- concentrating its forces on
<br>
its own defense -- not having troops in Bosnia, South Korea, Okinawa,
<br>
Kosovo, Saudi Arabia, Germany, and soon Colombia.
<br>
<p>Later!
