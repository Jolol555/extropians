<em>&gt; I don't understand the attack on Kuhn.  What is it in Kuhn (presumably &quot;The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;) that you connect to a &quot;delusion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical laws are created by people&quot;?  My reading of Kuhn was that it takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time for people (even scientists) to accept a fundamental change in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of how reality works.  I didn't think he had said that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world hadn't changed until the consensus had settled on the new view.
</em><br>
<p>Kuhn's theory was that all scientific theories are equally and
<br>
subjectively valid, and one only gains credence over another due to
<br>
class conflict between established scientists and the younger
<br>
generations of scientists.
