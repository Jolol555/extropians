Josh Cahoon has brought up the deep subject of *why* we believe what
<br>
we believe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why do you believe what you do? Why do I? We'd all like to believe that we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have arrived at the conclusions most tenable after dispassionate logical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analyses. I'm sure we all realize that there are other factors that play into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the formation of our beliefs, but most of us still feel that logic and reason 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; play a large role. What would we do with if we found out that reason is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minor factor?
</em><br>
<p>Reason is* a minor factor!  We obtain our initial beliefs in any given area
<br>
by various processes that I don't want to go into at this time.  But soon,
<br>
a new belief---say on whether schools should be publicly or privately
<br>
funded---will obtain from an entire gestalt very quickly calculated by
<br>
your brain.  The issue will almost instantly be filtered by all the
<br>
other beliefs and experiences that you've had.  Reason will have nothing
<br>
to do with it.  Your initial &quot;take&quot; is what is most likely to evolve 
<br>
within a few seconds into permanent belief.
<br>
<p>The role of reason---for the very few who actually hold internal debates
<br>
----is to expose your new belief to a variety of well formulated logical
<br>
attacks based on your other beliefs and upon a huge number of memes
<br>
lodged in your mind.  Should any of these logical attacks or memes begin
<br>
to seriously apply, or if through further thought you discover
<br>
inconsistencies in your total view, then you can begin to employ
<br>
reason to seek a consistent final version.  Our public debates simply
<br>
amplify this same process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are several lines of evidence that are pushing me toward considering 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this possibility. One idea, not new to most on this list, I'm sure, is that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free will is an illusion, and that all our behavior/beliefs are simply the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcomes of the laws of physics.
</em><br>
<p>That has utterly nothing to do with the discussion at hand (IMO).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The recent presidential election snafu also gave me pause in considering why 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we believe what we do.
</em><br>
<p>Very good.  I'd pay real money to be able to open a magic envelop and read
<br>
the correct percentage of those who contribute to this list who had the
<br>
very same experience as you relate.  I certainly did.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see any particular consonance between conservative or Republican
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought and not wanting recounts, on the one hand, and liberal or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Democratic thought and wanting recounts, on the other.
</em><br>
<p>Yes!  Quite so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet it's my impression that a large majority of people who had opinions as to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether recounts should be undertaken had the opinion that was most likely to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aid their favored candidate's election.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wanted Gore to win. I wanted recounts. I thought I wanted recounts because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that seemed the fairest way to resolve such a close count. But maybe the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I wanted Gore to win was a much more important factor in determining my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position on recounts.  Maybe preference for Gore or Bush was the most important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factor in determining why all of us had the positions we did regarding recounts.
</em><br>
<p>That is exactly so.  Recall my description of the belief formation mechanism
<br>
above.  In this case, human brains watching television or whatever took an
<br>
instantaneous snapshot of the whole issue.  Except for just a few of us who
<br>
had prior experience with recounts or the recount issue, (certainly not me)
<br>
the immediate result in our brains was mismatch:  few entries---experiences,
<br>
prior beliefs, or memes---were encountered.  We were thus relatively free
<br>
to conjecture a new belief, and only afterwards AND ONLY IF WE WERE AMONG
<br>
THAT SPECIAL SUBSET OF PEOPLE did we subject our new belief to true rational
<br>
analysis (based again on memes and vague political theories that we adhere
<br>
to in general).  
<br>
<p>So, now that we were free to *conjecture* a new belief, guess what?  We
<br>
immediately seized upon the belief that was most emotionally compelling,
<br>
to wit, the one that favored our own candidate in a highly charged election.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That seems a rather troubling prospect.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that it's anything new :-)   Not only that, but given the
<br>
necessity for speed that our brains had to have in our evolutionary past,
<br>
and also the definite advantages for speed now, it *has* to work that way.
<br>
Our emotions are too integral a part of our reasoning process (see Antonio
<br>
Damiaso &quot;Descartes Error&quot;, or Joseph LeDoux &quot;The Emotional Brain&quot;) for us
<br>
to entertain the idea that they can be dispensed with at the present time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wanted Gore to win. I wanted recounts. I thought I wanted recounts because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that seemed the fairest way to resolve such a close count. But maybe the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I wanted Gore to win...
</em><br>
<p>Join the very small club of those people who will occasionally say something
<br>
that could be used by their political antagonists.  &quot;See?&quot;, one of those
<br>
idiots might shout, &quot;some of those Gore supporters even *admit* that they
<br>
just wanted Gore to win, and that's why they want the recounts!&quot;.   Precisely
<br>
the same argument would be equally true if the political polarity of the last
<br>
two sentences was reversed.
<br>
<p>It's entirely possible that you have a judicial temperament.  What is really
<br>
annoying and even frightening is how many jurists---not to mention laymen
<br>
on this very list---hardly understand what we are talking about.  So 
<br>
tightly integrated are their emotions in their thoughts AT ALL TIMES
<br>
that they literally begin to suspect that we are playing games, or 
<br>
are being pretty sneaky in some way that they don't fully understand.
<br>
A judicial temperament allows one at times to come to a conclusion
<br>
that is at total odds with one's ideals and at total odds with one's
<br>
feelings.  It actually hurts to admit the new decision.
<br>
