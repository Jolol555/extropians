Below was one of the best &quot;avoiding serious challanges to our own forgone
<br>
conclusions&quot; jobs I have seen in long time.  Let's be serious!!

<em>&gt; &gt;Of the notes I have read on this issue, I think people here are really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;missing the point. People who have strong beliefs in religion live longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;because they have established a sense of emotional fulfillment in terms
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;their place in existence, a value system, and a community. Religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;belief is only one expression of this phenomena.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is one possible explanation. But it must be remembered that it is
</em><br>
only
<br>
<em>&gt; a theory. Until somebody comes up with hard facts even my rather silly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation of fiddling the numbers could be correct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Three other examples approached from different angles support this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;contention. First, women's life expectancy in developed western nations
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;longer than men's. That is because women are more capable of developing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;deeper, more satisfying emotional relationships.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another explanation could be as simple as women's metabolism running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slightly slower than men's. I am sure I could come up with more...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Women cook and so are more likely to eat balanced diets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Women have a culture of listening to their bodies, unlike men who often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't seem to recognise problems before they become dangerous. (I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recently read a piece from a doctor pleading that men become more
</em><br>
conscious
<br>
<em>&gt; of their bodies.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;...the never been married single man has the lowest life expectancy. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fact has also been demonstrated in many survival situations. One example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;being the Donner party, being trapped by winter snows in the Sierra
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Nevada, the unattached single men were the first to die.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Young men have hardly any subcutaneous fat. In snow-bound conditions this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be a fatal trait. They also tend to be more reckless. They certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have more car accidents than any other part of society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Lastly, in the Nazi concentration camps those who were best able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;psychologically survive the experience were those who held a strong
</em><br>
belief
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;system giving them the tools to deal with the situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;. This included, Catholics, Jews, communists, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't think of another explanation, and feel you may have the correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation here, but just because it sounds right doesn't mean it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It still may be completely wide of the truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All your explanations may be completely correct or may be totally wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All we can do is suggest possibilities until someone goes out and does the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment to prove it one way or the other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK. Any volunteers to sign up for a nazi-style death camp? Your death
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; be in a good cause...  :-)
