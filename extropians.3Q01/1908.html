<em>&gt; Too many libertarians, in my opinion, forget the importance

</em><br>
<em>&gt; really is God).
</em><br>
<p>Hunter-gatherer communism is more natural in groups the size of
<br>
hunter-gatherer tribal units. This doesn't supplant capitalism, either,
<br>
because even in hunter gatherer groups you have specialization of labor
<br>
(shaman, healer, hunter, gatherer, leader, toolmaker, etc) where
<br>
individuals trade on a voluntary basis to mutually agreed upon prices
<br>
the value of their respective work. Additionally, you have in such
<br>
cultures free market trade occuring between hunter gatherer groups of
<br>
goods that are plentiful in one locale but rare in another. This basis
<br>
of comparative advantage is of critical importance to the continuance of
<br>
a hunter gatherer culture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can probably safely state, however, that for human beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism is &quot;natural&quot; if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  there is a sufficient tradition of liberty in a culture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.  the ruling government or state is not overly powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.  no existing religion has absolute control, unless it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     fairly mild and isn't antithetical to profit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that I see why you wish to describe capitalism as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;natural&quot;
</em><br>
<p>THis is correct, because the above conditions exist when man is 'in a
<br>
state of nature'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Capitalism is after all is what happens when one quits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trying to impose systems on man.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While I can't agree with that for the aforesaid reasons, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true that in comparison, systems that arise from the concentration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of power at a central focus seem artificial in comparison.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, they do.
