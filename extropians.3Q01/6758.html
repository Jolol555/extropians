<p>
I know that by raising this issue, I am going to take a large
<br>
amount of flak.  But that is the purpose of the Extropian
<br>
list -- to engage in rational discussion of ideas -- even
<br>
if those ideas may seem repulsive at first.
<br>
<p>Those of us who believe in the extropian/transhumanist perspectives
<br>
expect that the world is likely to undergo a significant adjustment
<br>
of its perspective over the next 10-30 years.  These will include
<br>
such developments as artificial intelligence, molecular nanotechnology,
<br>
the elimination of aging and death and the feasibility of uploading
<br>
our minds into much more robust hardware.
<br>
<p>We also know, from calculations that I and Eliezer (independently)
<br>
have done, that the annual cost between where we are now and the
<br>
full manifestation of what we expect is feasible is of the order
<br>
of 50 million lives per year.  That is approximately 10,000 times
<br>
the number of lives lost in the WTC attacks.
<br>
<p>According to the CIA world fact book, the population of Afganistan
<br>
is ~25 million people.  In contrast the population of the U.S.
<br>
is 280+ million people and the world is 6+ billion.  It is highly
<br>
unlikely that the population of Afganistan will make a significant
<br>
contribution to the development of the advanced technological era
<br>
we expect.  In fact their ongoing existence seems likely to be
<br>
directed towards negatively impacting that development.  To the
<br>
extent that the activities of individuals in Afganistan, or the
<br>
support of such individuals by the leaders or population at large
<br>
delay the development of the era we anticipate, we can assign
<br>
a cost to it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From my perspective the analysis is relatively simple.  If the
</em><br>
population of Afganistan, or the people supported by them
<br>
delay the onset of an era of advanced technological capabilities
<br>
by 6 months or more, the value of their lives is negative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a rational position, *if* the case can be made that the
</em><br>
Afgani position &amp; politics is likely to result in the diversion
<br>
of resources and delay the development of the technologies we anticipate
<br>
developing by more than 6 months, then a plan of genocide to
<br>
bury the country in rubble seems justified.
<br>
<p>Is this feasible?  It would appear to be the case.  100 Minutemann III
<br>
ICBMs could launch 300+ Ktons each at Afganistan.  This roughly
<br>
translates to over 1 ton TNT/person.  While this is unlikely to
<br>
kill everyone, it is likely to knock the population back to the
<br>
sub-cave-person level and make a large negative impact on the
<br>
feasibility of staging terrorist activities from that country.
<br>
<p>Of course the downside will be in the likelyhood that it may have
<br>
in promoting individuals and countries in developing similar
<br>
capabilities.  But of course once the line has been crossed, there
<br>
are relatively few barriers towards the use of nuclear weapons to
<br>
continue knocking down potential terrorists as needs require.
