<em>&gt; &gt; I think the solution to this is to hold United and American Airlines, as

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; airplanes flew from, financially responsible for the damages of today's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attacks, for their negligence in ensuring the security of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; airlines. The pressure of this financial impact will most certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; force all other airlines to beef their security up to professional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; levels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think we have any way of tracing glass or ceramic knives
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than bankrupt both airlines resulting in severe shortage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flights and carriers that would cripple the economy even more.
</em><br>
<p>These two airlines were leaders in the lobbying to disband the Air
<br>
Marshals years ago. They didn't want to pay for them, and they didn't
<br>
want to keep giving away a seat they could be charging for.
<br>
<p>What this is is an example of poor risk management. Numerous security
<br>
consultants have warned the airlines about this for years, (since 1993
<br>
at least) and they've refused to do anything about it. We've known since
<br>
the early 1980's that terrorists are quite willing to die in their
<br>
attacks, this is simply a faster car bomb.
<br>
<p>El Al operates just fine with proper security procedures. To bad they
<br>
don't fly around the US very much, I'd make them my preferred carrier.
