<em>&gt;From: Mike Lorrey &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20Paying%20for%20education&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108231533.IAA19999@well.com&gt;">mlorrey@datamann.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;Kids may be bright, but that doesn't make them literate. They need
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to learn literacy no matter how bright they are. It's not genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to come out of the womb literate. The difference between my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education and kids of today is noticeable, and I'm not that old.
</em><br>
<p>Good point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Even in those days, the poorest who dropped out of school
</em><br>
<em>&gt;typically did so with an education gained by the 6th grade that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;roughly equivalent to the sort of education our teachers impart to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our kids today by the 12th grade. Nor do those who are destined
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for non-degree jobs need to be able to quote Dostoyevsky or Homer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One of the big problems with education today is that vocational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;training has been removed from many high schools, it is treated as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a post-secondary educational course, when prior to public
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education, kids could drop out of high school with more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;skills as machinists or draftsmen than many vocational graduates
</em><br>
<em>&gt;today. Not every kid needs a college prep education, but teachers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seem to think they do.
</em><br>
<p>I'm going to disagree with you on this and side with Mortimer
<br>
Adler.
<br>
<p>The purpose of a true liberal (in the educational sense) education
<br>
is to create a citizen fit to live in a democracy. I oppose the
<br>
notion of a lesser education thereby deliberately creating an
<br>
underclass.
<br>
<p>And non-degree jobs are scarce and getting scarcer.
