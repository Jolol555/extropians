<em>&gt; All these systems, procedures and activities were already in place before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the attack.  They were kept quiet and occasionally investigated by congress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now in light of the recent terrorist attacks these things are being publicly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified.  Nothing has really changed.  Even the proposed restrictions on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encryption were already being pushed by the current administration before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the attack.  This is business as usual, with just more honesty about what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are doing.
</em><br>
<p>This is only &quot;business as usual&quot; in the sense that there has been a push to do
<br>
such things and worse for some time.  What is not &quot;business as usual&quot; is that
<br>
many people in their fear and desire to do something may agree to throw away
<br>
a lot of liberty and privacy where they would not be likely to do so before.
<br>
There is ample reason to fear this.  Ignore it at your peril.
