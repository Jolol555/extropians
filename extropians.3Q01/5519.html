<p>Hey, no picking on the Borg!  :-)
<br>
<p>Seriously, at least Gore had some small understanding of and
<br>
appreciation for the Internet and technology generally.  Too
<br>
many of the Bush clan believe it is the instrument of Satan and
<br>
should be severely controlled.  Call me paranoid, but does it
<br>
strike anyone else as interesting that the combination of
<br>
legislation, enforcement, and the technology market being
<br>
slammed along with investment capital in general has precisely
<br>
the effect of slowing and curtailing the freedom and speed of
<br>
technological innovation especially concerning the Net?  It also
<br>
slows down progress toward Singularity.  Does anyone think this
<br>
just might be on purpose, at least in part?
