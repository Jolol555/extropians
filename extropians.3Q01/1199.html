<p>
John, in what seems to me to be an infrequent case
<br>
of faulty logic claimed:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree, I wish it were different but that's the way it is and I see no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signs of that changing for the better. H bombs are just too big, too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numerous, and too cheap, there is no defense against them.
</em><br>
<p>Come now.  There is a very simple, low tech defense which is
<br>
simply to put enough matter between oneself and any exploding
<br>
bombs.  Both the U.S. and Russia decided a long time ago that
<br>
if you are far enough underground the bombs don't really
<br>
create that much of a threat.  If one simply inverted the
<br>
altitude of much of the U.S. city infrastructure the damage
<br>
that bombs would cause would be significantly reduced.  Its
<br>
only because we have built &quot;up&quot; instead of &quot;down&quot; that we
<br>
have a problem to deal with.
<br>
<p>Alternately once fiber with sufficient capacity for tele-presence
<br>
becomes ubiquitous, people may begin to concentrate themselves
<br>
less in major urban centers.  If the U.S. population were spread
<br>
out over its land area in a uniform way the threat of bombs would
<br>
also be significantly reduced.
<br>
<p>Bombs are threatening only to specific population and infrastructure
<br>
configurations that we happen to have today.
<br>
<p>Robert
