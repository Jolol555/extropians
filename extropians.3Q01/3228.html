I agree with some of the specifics you list below. But as insiders to this
<br>
tradition we are likely to notice various &quot;nuances&quot;. Many of the differences
<br>
between us and Plato and can be traced to his little ontological mistake:
<br>
namely that our ancestry traces back not to the divine but to slime. But I
<br>
suppose we can forgive Plato for not having read Darwin.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;W are not claiming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the telos just for humanity's best (although I guess we all from time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time see ourselves as the select philosophers of the future; just a bit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-serving pride) but for all of humanity.  As Carl Feynman put it:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Godlike powers can be mass-produced and inexpensive.
</em><br>
Agreed. In some ways, Plato was not exactly egalitarian. He held that only
<br>
philosophers are born with a gold soul, others have silver or bronze souls.
<br>
Of course we must remember that Plato allowed that one might upgrade (or
<br>
downgrade) one's soul on the next incarnation depending on one's progress
<br>
this time around. So the difference may not be as great as it first seems.
<br>
Furthermore, from an outsider's perspective it looks like a small matter
<br>
whether some or all are to become Godlike. It is hubristic either way.
<br>
(Furthermore, it is, at least for some, an open question whether all of
<br>
humanity will choose to become Godlike. Some may opt out).
<br>
<p><em> &gt;Also, this telos is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not seen as some single Platonic ideal, but rather ethically at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (after all, we have plenty of convergentists here who think future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development will converge on some state or another) we can select many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different possible directions. The telos is towards greater self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actualisation, but that might be something more akin to the plurality of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aristotelian virtues rather than a single ideal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Aristotle held that there was a plurality of virtues, but so did Plato. (See
<br>
Julia Annas, _Platonic Ethics Old and New). Of course this plurality is
<br>
supposed to be unified, hence the doctrine of human flourishing,
<br>
(eudaemonism). Both held that the best account of human flourishing is to
<br>
become as godlike as possible.
<br>
<p><p><p><em> &gt; I think Plato would be horrified by the idea of transhumanism
</em><br>
I am not sure myself what Plato would have thought. His writings are
<br>
exploratory and tentative, not doctrinaire. But even if he was horried so
<br>
what? Some philosophers get very upset with the idea that their views might
<br>
need changing or updating. (We can all think of at least one, if we think
<br>
objectively.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;- we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeking to become something different from human, and we gladly accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change.
</em><br>
With respect to Plato, it depends what you mean by 'human'. Plato held that
<br>
some of us have a divine element in us. With the help of philosophy we can
<br>
cultivate that element and sublimate the less rational parts of our soul. So
<br>
Plato sees this sort of change as good: overcome the &quot;human all too human&quot;
<br>
part of your soul and emphasize the divine element of your soul.
<br>
<p>In Plato's view (which in this respect seem amusingly similar to
<br>
<em>&gt; Jeremy Rifkin's in _Entropy_) change is a bad thing, due to our remoteness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the Ideal. The only acceptable change is towards an ideal state, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then it would stop.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I am not sure what you mean by the last two sentences. (Is this your view or
<br>
Plato's in the last sentence?) Plato's view is that change towards the ideal
<br>
is good. The project on earth here is to order our world to make it more
<br>
godlike. The political part of this project, of course, is described in The
<br>
Republic (and elsewhere). Plato sees change as terminating once we have
<br>
reached perfection. Indeed, it would be wrong to change once perfection is
<br>
reached. Of course if change for its own sake is part of perfection then
<br>
Plato is wrong. Mark
