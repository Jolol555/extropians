<p><em>&gt; I understand about the word &quot;Mexican&quot; - there's nothing wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with that word per se...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...I pasted in something from Natasha's recent post:  &quot;At first,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only those with money or connections had them.  Today, in downtown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Los Angeles, there are more Mexicans using cell phones than executives.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What was the implication in that sentence?  That once upon a time when cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phones were expensive they had a certain cachet as only rich hoity-toity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CEOs could get their hands on them; but now these formerly exclusive handy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little gadgets have become so cheap and plentiful that &quot;Mexicans&quot; have them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Mexicans in this case standing for a catch-all word meaning what? -- poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people? riff-raff? the hoi-polloi? illegal aliens?). [YOUR IMPLICATIONS,
</em><br>
not hers]
<br>
<p>Now, I think that there *is* an implication in that sentence that
<br>
Mexicans are poorer than business executives, and are poorer
<br>
than some other ethnic groups.  But Olga---this is a fact!  If
<br>
I imagine that some small enclave of people of my racial persuasion
<br>
were to have to flee to Japan, and for *whatever* reason were poorer
<br>
than the Japanese, I would not be offended by such a sentence.  The
<br>
sentence would only be alluding to a fact (or a widely-assumed fact).
<br>
<p>The huge mistake that the left has made is this:  people are not
<br>
only supposed to not allude to certain facts, but worse, they're
<br>
not even supposed to *recognize* certain realities.  It's a little
<br>
bit like thought-crime.  This puts a fiendish burden on everyone,
<br>
themselves included!  As we discussed before, any normally functioning
<br>
human being constantly generalizes; it's part of how one's nervous
<br>
system works, and if it didn't, we'd never have evolved to where we are.
<br>
If you happened to live in a country where those people who were dressed
<br>
a certain way, or had some other distinguishing characteristic, were
<br>
more likely to harm you than others, you *could* *not* *help* but
<br>
notice.  To then pound yourself with criticism over your own
<br>
stereotyping reminds me of nothing so much as Orwell's 1984.  Out
<br>
of sheer ideology---or because the party says so---facts are denied,
<br>
thought is controlled.
<br>
<p>Which is it you want?  For Natasha to not have such thoughts, i.e.,
<br>
exercise such mental agility that thought-crime is impossible, or
<br>
merely for her never to *say* what she is thinking?  And if the
<br>
latter, then how do you think that she is going to *feel* about
<br>
her evil thoughts?  The Christians make it even a sin to lust,
<br>
and so they're screwed, because humans will always lust, and it's
<br>
the same thing here.  (What should have been a sin is to *act*.)
<br>
<p>I'm starting to think that you'd be happy with the Chinese self-
<br>
criticism sessions that were on-going for a couple of decades.
<br>
Every week *everyone* would join a self-criticism group, and
<br>
confess their bourgeois tendencies and lack of focus and failure
<br>
to more steadfastly incorporate Mao ZheDong thought.  Just think:
<br>
if we had those here, then each week you could go confess the
<br>
way that you yourself had been unconsciously noticing patterns
<br>
and stereotyping.  Wouldn't that be great?
<br>
<p>Your political correctness even reached fever pitch when you 
<br>
analysed Brian's perfectly innocent observation about Mexicans.
<br>
(You even admitted that there were no implications at all,
<br>
unlike Natasha's transgression.)  What had Brian failed to
<br>
do right?  I'll tell you!  He didn't qualify his sentence
<br>
about the Mexicans with newspeak.  I mean, he didn't qualify
<br>
his sentence with indicators showing solidarity with the
<br>
masses.  Oops. Wrong country again.  I mean, he didn't
<br>
qualify his sentence with politically correct panderings
<br>
to progressive forces, i.e., he could have said &quot;Latinos&quot;,
<br>
or he could have thrown in a phrase about exploitation, or
<br>
something.  But he didn't, and you were on him in a flash.
<br>
<p>I am not so mean as to hope that you get your wish, and that we
<br>
all, including you, watch what we say and watch what we think.
<br>
