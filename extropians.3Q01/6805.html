Difficult as it is to fathom, it looks as though some wealthy individuals
<br>
were already shorting stock in reinsurance companies quite heavily for
<br>
a couple weeks before the WTC/Pentagon attacks, and there are (quite
<br>
possibly unsubstantiated) rumours of links to Bin Laden.
<br>
<p>To know that something like that was going to happen, and then not only
<br>
not try to stop it, but to also take steps to profit from it, strikes
<br>
me as being so astonishingly evil that I don't even know how to process
<br>
it, so I'm not going to.  I'm just going to hope that it turns out to
<br>
be a basically false story, and the trades attributed to the normal maneuverings
<br>
that go on in the market in any given week.
<br>
<p>I apologize for mentioning this and not providing a link to an actual
<br>
news story.  It's just that I've been inhaling *so many* articles that
<br>
I really cannot remember what the source was.

<p>Sean, I assume that you used the word &quot;funnily&quot; as an alternative to
<br>
&quot;strangely,&quot; &quot;peculiarly,&quot; that type of thing, because there is certainly
<br>
nothing funny about it.

</em><br>
<p>His father started one of Saudi's largest construction firms.  Bin Laden
<br>
inherited a share of it worth around USD $300 million, and proceeded
<br>
to cash out and start his crusade.
