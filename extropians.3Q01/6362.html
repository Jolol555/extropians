<em>&gt; &gt;If the US does do anything real, militarily, it will probably

<em>&gt; &gt;hatred of the United States.  I don't expect that will stop the

<em>&gt; &gt;United States from doing it anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We want the people who did this, plain and simple, and we will stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at nothing to get them. Anything or anybody who tries to stand in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But that's not all there is to it, we want to eliminate organized
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorism forever, period.
</em><br>
<p>And if your violent solution basically guarantees the future of terrorism?
<br>
Like trying to stop insects by flooding the place with DDT. It may work 
<br>
temporarily, but they bounce back with renewed vigour and this time all the 
<br>
birds that previously controlled them are gone.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;This is pretty much how I expected the future to go.  If we're

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that interval. But if we aren't that lucky, I won't be surprised.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If we eliminate organized terrorism we may never have to face these

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;An idea worth dying, (and killing) for.
</em><br>
<p>At this point you are sounding just like one of the suicide pilots.
<br>
I am not trying to insult you, I am just wanting you to look at what you 
<br>
are saying. Please step back for a moment and see what the repercussions 
<br>
are two or three moves later.
<br>
<p>Eliminating terrorism is a laudable aim.
<br>
The best idea on this that I have read so far is of forming a think-tank on 
<br>
using very unconventional means to reach that end. Weapons won't do it. 
<br>
Education almost certainly will. The trick is how do you get information to 
<br>
areas such as those? How do you lift people out of such poverty that a 
<br>
fantasy of fucking 72 virgins forever looks like a good option instead of 
<br>
the mind-warp that it is? My next-door neighbors are islamic. Very nice 
<br>
folk... ummm except for the mother... she won't allow the kids to read any 
<br>
of the books I give them. The father seems a nice enough guy, but the 
<br>
mother is full-on. The kids are totally charming.
<br>
<p>If the US lifted all sanctions tomorrow and showered the fundamentalist 
<br>
extremist states with food, knowledge, luxuries, and wealth, without 
<br>
pushing the American culture, the extremists would be screwed and the 
<br>
violence would end -- not instantly, but it would end.
<br>
<p>It won't happen though. People love hatred too much.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
