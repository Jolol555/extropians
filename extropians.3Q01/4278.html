</em><br>
<em>&gt; I consider a reasonable and workable view to be a view that helps further human

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cybergnosticism has several serious problems:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Psychologically, it is not a positive approach to something but rather an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; escape from something. 
</em><br>
<p>As you have defined it (and imho slanted the definition
<br>
somewhat), there is no argument here.  But the view that the
<br>
material world (or at least standard biologically based
<br>
existence) is inefficient is certainly not at all untrue.  And
<br>
being able to transcend many of those limitations is certainly
<br>
something most of us actively desire.  Is this all escapism? 
<br>
Where is the line? 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Such avoidance philosophies are not very good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivators, especially when they turn away from the messy real world as it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today and do not look much for the road from here to the putative utopia.  As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cybergnosticism is expressed among transhumanism it is almost always in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of speculations rather than practical proposals, not even discussions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about uploading technologies based on theoretical applied science.
</em><br>
<p>Well, there is a huge place for speculation.  Out of speculation
<br>
comes thoughts and visions of what it may be to live and be
<br>
within a computational matrix.  This is pretty important work. 
<br>
It is not all about the nuts and bolts.   I do agree though that
<br>
a largely unexplored and undeveloped area is more crucially not
<br>
worked out than either the nuts and bolts of uploading or the
<br>
envisioning of the possibilities and implications.  That is how
<br>
to get there from here on all fronts - not just the technical
<br>
but also the social, political, ethical and psychological
<br>
fronts.  But it is not just cybergnostic folks who duck or at
<br>
least don't focus much on many of these issues.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Instead it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tends to produce long discussions of the benefits and transcendence of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploaded state, which rather conveniently ignore all the practical aspects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being uploaded. Somebody has to pay the electricity bill even when you are an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upload.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Are you sure there will be an electricity bill as we currently
<br>
know them?  I'm not.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Whether we consider the material world good or bad is in the end a subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluation. But a mind that rejects the material world is likely to find that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever experiences awaits beyond uploading will have similarities to those of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the material world. 
</em><br>
<p>I think this may be a pointless round-about between different
<br>
possible positions in a spectrum.   In reminds me of
<br>
positionings in the sci-fi novel, Diaspora.  Good and bad
<br>
evaluations are pretty irrelevant.  A mind that gravitates
<br>
toward cyberian existence with little/no involvement  with or
<br>
interest in the material world strata is not necessarily lacking
<br>
in insight, intelligence, integrity or any other value.  These
<br>
sentients simply wish to explore and experience a bit
<br>
differently to the extent they can.  
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;They will hence be tainted by their hint of materiality and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cybergnostic will seek ever larger distance between themselves and the old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality. What should be important is the practical benefits of uploading and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar stuff, not the assumed ethical/aesthetic primacy of one form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experienced reality over another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree with reservations.  The first reservations are on what
<br>
limits you put on the word &quot;practical&quot;.  The second is that I do
<br>
not believe that all of what you have call cybergnosticism
<br>
actually makes a primary value judgment of one form of reality
<br>
being ethically preferable to the other.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Brain/minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at the current level are relatively inefficient and bound up by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evolutionary patterns that make them rather biased, although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;impure&quot; is going too far.  If mind can be captured and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transferred from brain to upload &quot;brain&quot; in software and perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; downloaded into various vehicles then there is a degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; support for a sort of mind/body dualism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, it would be far more like the classical dualism where souls and bodies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were like lego pieces that could be put together, separated and perhaps moved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around. Very much like &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;.  But in most dualism the soul is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumed to be able to exist without a body. This is something not allowed for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by uploading - information always has to be embodied as a pattern in something.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But what is the pattern itself?  Is the encoding of software as
<br>
regions of a disk drive its body?  Is the software a thing in
<br>
and of itself, a sort of pure Idea worked out in its details and
<br>
spun with other Ideas?  Is a story separate from its printing in
<br>
a book?  Even in mysticism the soul is assumed to be embodied
<br>
within the mind of God or some reasonable equivalent.  So what
<br>
is the difference here?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; That an uploaded existence would be practical in many ways and look like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dualist universe (although from the inside of the virtual world it wouldn't,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since the underlying hardware would be hidden by several abstraction levels)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't mean that the cybergnostic condemnation of the material becomes more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't see any reason for condemnation so much as recognizing
<br>
limits and deciding what kinds of limits you are and aren't
<br>
interested in living with.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is too early to assume that such an emulation will be always  a part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being an upload.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Always&quot; is a long time. But I prefer to refrain from speculate about magical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (cognitive) technology that can somehow unravel a mind and reform it (without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any loss of perceived identity) into an entity that does not act through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanoid input/output channels. The brain evolved as a sensory and motor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integration system, and that underlying function is deeply etched into its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Into the brain, yes.  But we are uploading minds.  Not
<br>
necessarily the same thing although I agree the unraveling may
<br>
take a while.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In the long run we will likely move beyond this, but I would want you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider how much of our anatomy is still based on our underwater origins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundreds of millions of years after leaving the sea. Even with deliberate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redesign it is hard to get rid of basic structures. At the same time, even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic patterns were once used for function A they can later be used for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functions B and C - the basal ganglia were once just motor control systems, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are now involved in planning and deduction, it seems. Tomorrow their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;descendants&quot; might be wired to simulation engines and instead be used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; select futures directly - same basic structure, extended functions. But the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic structure can also induce affordances and limitations that are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible to remove.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how these examples from physical humanoid biology
<br>
are necessarily applicable.  We don't have the ability to
<br>
redesign that level yet.  None of these structures are mandatory
<br>
to be brought over in an upload afaik, although I realize some
<br>
believe that all of them must be emulated for the uploads to
<br>
function and remain sane.  I don't see any reason we would not
<br>
shed as many outmoded features as we currently can as quickly as
<br>
we can in the much more pliable upload environment.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think transhumanism needs a good perspective of embodiment to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; becoming dualist or cybergnostic. It is easy to say that one wants to change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; one's body, but implicit in that statement is the assumption that the change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; will not change oneself. This is not true; any change of the body is a change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of oneself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't see why avoidance of mere labels adds anything at all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; value.  If the mind is separable from the body you immediately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have a form of real dualism. If we can in fact function as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent beings in a vastly expanded capacity once thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; separated from our original bodies (uploaded) then a form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what is prejudicially labelled cybergnosticism in fact makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sense and is seemingly inevitable.  Value judgements of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pre-upload state as being &quot;impure&quot; are of course not necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And that is really the point! I have no problems at all with thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of an existence as a liquid entity online, where aspects of existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be handled by many different substrates. But my problem starts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when people start to denigrate the material world, the embodied self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and project what is essentially a mystic vision onto the technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future. That form of thinking seriously hurts both the credibility of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism in the public sphere and practical attempts to achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals in the real world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK.  I have much more room for &quot;mystic visions&quot; of the
<br>
technological future because I think the possibilities inherent
<br>
in the technology will lead to problems and situations that look
<br>
a lot like quite a bit of the mystical literature pretty
<br>
quickly.  I could be wrong of course.  
<br>
<p>Also, as I've mentioned many times, if you ever want some of the
<br>
more spiritual/religious people to at least not oppose and even
<br>
actively promote transhumanist goals then it helps to show where
<br>
some of the promises of their religions can  be acheived (to the
<br>
extent they aren't simply illogical impossibilities) by some of
<br>
this technology.   
<br>
<p>I don't think this bit of diversity hurts at all in net effect. 
<br>
It could even help. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; As for whether it is just a matter of labels if I change my body or if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I change myself, I would suggest considering the following example:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose you cut yourself deliberately. If you think that you cut your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body, then this act is to some extent divorced from you: the essential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you has not been affected, and the effects of the act are merely input
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and conditions for you to perceive and handle. That it was deliberate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was merely like any other act of deliberate harm against your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possessions. If you think you have cut yourself, then you also take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into account that this act has a far deeper importance for you than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cutting (say) your clothing. It is not just a change in your situation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but also an act that has changed what it means to be yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (slightly).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not a very good example on multiple levels.  Both views are true
<br>
within certain parameters.
