</em><br>
<p>Exactly! And even if it was Cartesian dualism, they would still
<br>
have to deal with the issue: will it work? The first upload is
<br>
going to be a significant philosophical experiment. 
<br>
<p>I wonder how much the separation of hardware and software was
<br>
inspired by dualism, and how much was engineering benefits.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Off topic, but glancing at your other e-mail, I'm damned if I know what to

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Isn't this a rather general problem, the mistaking of reality for
<br>
symbols (and symbols for reality)? It seems to be more common in
<br>
the more symbol-oriented academic disciplines, and given the
<br>
distance between the two cultures it is even easier to mix them up
<br>
when looking across the chasm - humanists seeing science and
<br>
engineering concepts as symbols rather than reality, and scientists
<br>
getting upset about the apparent total relativism of
<br>
postmodernists.
