<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; So you reckon that people at the bottom of the economic ladder
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; should get to send their kids to the same kind of school that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; do now but pay for it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They can send their kids to any school they can afford.
</em><br>
<p>Which begs the question, how much school could they afford?
<br>
Seems to me that in a private setting education would be better
<br>
and cheaper, that is, if we are brave enough to separate in
<br>
our minds &quot;education&quot; and &quot;schooling&quot;. Because of various
<br>
laws and regulations, and perhaps most importantly parenting
<br>
memes, private schools are largely run like public schools, so
<br>
the fact that the results are better, but not radically so should
<br>
hardly be a surprise. However, consider what might be possible
<br>
if we junked the old school mentality and used innovative techniques
<br>
to educate our children.
<br>
<p>Someone pointed out earlier that a good foreign language school
<br>
can teach moderate fluency in a foreign language in an 80 hour
<br>
emersion course (probably with some additional homework.) Compare
<br>
that to school. I studied French for four years in school, three
<br>
hours a week, amounting to about 500 hours of instruction. After
<br>
all that, nobody would call me anything like moderately fluent
<br>
in French. But lets assume that that schooling achieved the same
<br>
results. That means that the public schools took six times as long
<br>
to achieve the same result. That is shockingly poor performance,
<br>
but hardly surprising to anyone who studies the efficiency of government
<br>
service provision.
<br>
<p>Consider for a moment, if we could translate that into the whole
<br>
of education. Since there is great variation in subjects, lets
<br>
assume that the average is three times as efficient. (Is this reasonable?
<br>
I think it is more than generous. I remember reading, from a source
<br>
I don't have handy, that it takes about 100 hours of tutorial style
<br>
instruction -- spread over time -- to give a child literacy and
<br>
numeracy. The public schools take perhaps 6000 hours of instruction
<br>
-- six years of elementary school -- to do the same, that is, assuming
<br>
they do ever do achieve literacy and numeracy.)
<br>
<p>If a child spends 12 years in school, and about 1000 hours of instruction
<br>
per year (35-40 weeks, at 30 hours per week), they receive 12,000 hours
<br>
of instruction total. By our improved efficiency that would mean a
<br>
more dynamic education methodology could provide the same instruction
<br>
in 4,000 hours (assuming it is three, as opposed to six times more
<br>
efficient.)
<br>
<p>How much would that cost? Working in US dollars, if a teacher receives
<br>
a very generous salary of $75,000, plus they have to spend another $75,000
<br>
per year to provide a room, facilities, books etc., then our teacher
<br>
costs $150,000 per year. If they work a standard work year of 2,000 hours
<br>
then they cost $75 per hour (including facilities etc.) If they teach
<br>
a class of 20 students, that comes out to $3.75 per student per hour.
<br>
<p>(Of course that doesn't mean that one teacher has to teach everything,
<br>
that is the average cost, regardless of how many teachers we actually
<br>
have.)
<br>
<p>So our total cost for providing the equivalent of 12 years of public
<br>
school education is 4,000 x $3.75 = $15,000, which, is the equivalent
<br>
of $1,250 per year (over 12 years.)
<br>
<p>We might also find that if the teacher had only 10 students in the class
<br>
that they might provide education twice as efficiently, meaning that
<br>
we could get the same level of education for the same cost in money, and
<br>
only half the cost in the child's time. (Though God forbid that we consider
<br>
the child's time an important factor.)
<br>
<p>Lets say that this education method was concerned about poor people. In
<br>
such a case, they might charge $1,500 instead of $1,250, which would
<br>
generate a fund to allow 16% of their students to attend for zero cost.
<br>
<p>Alternatively, the poor person might take a loan, collateralized on their
<br>
future employment prospects to pay the bill. Of course our parenting memes
<br>
kick in here, and we call this exploitation, but it is no more exploitation
<br>
than college loans or venture capital.
<br>
<p>Such a system could never be run in the manner we do now. But there is
<br>
a big difference between schooling and education. Perhaps some education
<br>
companies might have an add on cost where they baby sit your kids for
<br>
the rest of the day. However, it seems to me that it would be far harder
<br>
to argue for a &quot;right to a baby sitter&quot; than it is to argue for a &quot;right
<br>
to an education.&quot; Even so, baby sitters are generally a lot cheaper than
<br>
teachers.
<br>
<p>How is it possible to educate kids three times more efficiently than
<br>
schools do? I'm not an educator, but some things are glaringly obvious
<br>
to me. The greatly improved use of technology, for example. Kids will
<br>
happily sit in front of a computer game for hours. It doesn't seem a
<br>
big step to mould that game around laudable educational goals. (I learned
<br>
to type with a game that dropped words down the screen Space Invaders
<br>
style, you had to type the word to destroy it.) Why doesn't the private
<br>
sector provide such software now? Well it does to an extent, however,
<br>
they have to compete with the education given by the public schools,
<br>
and it is very hard to compete against a competitor who charges zero cost.
<br>
(Hard, but not impossible.)
<br>
<p>Another obvious area of improvement is the ridiculous notion of breaking
<br>
education up into subjects, and then breaking these subjects up into
<br>
one hour timeslots, spread meandering throughout the week. This is done
<br>
for the convenience of educators and manipulation of teachers unions --
<br>
a history teacher is a history teacher, he can't possibly teach geography.
<br>
However, it is easy to see how such a system could be made more efficient.
<br>
(This week is Africa week. Mr Smith will be talking about African history,
<br>
stop by when you like. Ms Jones will be discussing African Geography,
<br>
Ms Davis will discuss African money systems.) It is a fact that
<br>
home-schoolers
<br>
often operate in this way, much more efficiently than public schools.
<br>
<p>Another obvious area of improvement is some of the tripe, political
<br>
correctness and &quot;citizenship&quot; baloney, that is motivated from an
<br>
indoctrinational point of view could, and should be, removed.
<br>
<p>Also, need I point out that the &quot;curriculum&quot; ideal of school is based
<br>
on a ridiculous assumption, namely that kids of the same chronological
<br>
age learn every subject at the same rate. When I was a kid I think I
<br>
can fairly say that I was never challenged at all in school. Because
<br>
of that, it made me very lazy, sloppy and taught me to hate school as
<br>
boring and a waste of time. I often hear of kids who come home from
<br>
school with straight A's on their report card. Most parents think this
<br>
is wonderful and reward their kids in some way. I think that, if this
<br>
happens on a regular basis, it is terrible, because it indicates that
<br>
the child finds everything easy, and is never challenged. They handed
<br>
in all their homework on time, they did what the teacher asked them,
<br>
but that is hardly a measure of learning. (Of course the fault is with
<br>
the school not the student.)
<br>
<p>One final, and obvious area of improvement is to leave kids alone. We
<br>
batter them with information 8 hours a day, then send them home with
<br>
three hours of homework. Kids, like adults, need time to process
<br>
information. They need to let their minds run free for a while. It
<br>
is my belief that this whole notion of forcing kids to treat school
<br>
like a profession is simply for the convenience of parents and schools.
<br>
Kids spend far too much time in school and not enough time playing,
<br>
thinking, talking with each other, investigating on their own, making
<br>
mud pies, playing with dolls and frogs and worms, raising gardens,
<br>
reading books they find interesting and lying in the back yard thinking
<br>
how much fun life is.
<br>
<p>One need only look at the epidemic of ADD to see that little boys
<br>
in particular need to run in a meadow occasionally. It is torture
<br>
for some of them to sit bolted to a chair. However, we consider this
<br>
a fault of the child rather than the fool who makes him sit in the
<br>
chair. We have the audacity to drug these kids rather than adapt to
<br>
their peculiar educational needs. (I'm not, btw, saying that ADD
<br>
does not exist or that Ritalin should never be used. However, when
<br>
we diagnose 30% of our young boys as mentally disabled, then I think
<br>
we need to re-examine our definition of mentally disabled.)
<br>
<p>The greatest crime of the public school system is not
<br>
that they don't educate our kids well (though they obviously don't)
<br>
but that they instill in the kids the idea that learning is difficult,
<br>
and a chore, and something to be avoided at all costs. Or worse still,
<br>
that learning is the same as schooling, that they are learning if they
<br>
submit their wills to the teacher, rather than opening their mind to
<br>
new ideas. From an extropian point of view, this borders on child
<br>
abuse.
<br>
<p>Especially as we move into the modern world where everything is changing,
<br>
kids need, most of all, to learn how to learn, and to recognize that
<br>
learning is an exciting part of life, something that brings joy, not
<br>
something that is a torment. Public schools are designed to make
<br>
socialist, politically correct factory workers, not extropian, free
<br>
thinking, futurists.
