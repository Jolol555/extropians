<em>&gt; Interesting,  not necessarily a bad idea.  I think the fear of &quot;more rapid

</em><br>
<p>Well, evolution for its own sake might not be that desirable (although
<br>
it is a wonderfully creative process). I would rather say we are
<br>
striving for more complexity than more evolution. 
<br>
<p>Hmm, it might be interesting to see if we could iuse the same trick
<br>
suggested for nanomachines to prevent evolution in GM bacteria: add
<br>
extra DNA repair (which will both prevent mutations and be metabolically
<br>
costly), and possibly make some of the potentially dangerous genes
<br>
brittle in the sense that any mutation there will disable the cell (how
<br>
to to achieve that?). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These new organisms will be dependent totally on the supply of the synthetic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amino acid  to produce its proteins.  I think this has been proposed before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a control mechanism for nanotech, Drexler most likley.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes. But I'm not certain the proposed amino acids are entirely
<br>
non-natural; beside the usual 22 amino acids quite a few make fleeting
<br>
appearances in biochemistry and I wouldn't want to bet that for a given
<br>
simple organic molecule there is *no* metabolic pathway in the biosphere
<br>
that produces it. If bacteria can survive on toulene as their sole
<br>
carbon source, then they can likely evolve to make any necessary amino
<br>
acid. The trick is to make them unable to evolve this, and make sure
<br>
they can't find a source in the environment (Linda Nagata did a nice
<br>
trick in her _Limit of Vision_ to show how you could get around such a
<br>
metabolic constraint on a GMO both short term and long term). 
<br>
<p>I think one has to base the metabolic key on something more tricky to
<br>
manufacture in cells. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I think the technology is an alternative to Drexlers 'assembler' based 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scheme.  If we succeed with 'BlueGene' like stuff, and can model and control 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protein folding, then designer proteins is translated into custom proteins 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with many possible new properties available.  The NYT article mentioned a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'teflon' like protein. I envision mas production of billions of nano 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; components for nano-electronics, nano-computing or optics.  
</em><br>
<p>Bio-nanotech has a great potential, and already a multiquadrillion cell
<br>
production base. It might not have the wide potential of hard drextech,
<br>
but it is a likely candidate for both early investment and bootstrapping
<br>
more advanced forms of nanotech.
