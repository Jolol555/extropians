<em>&gt; Daniel Ust, recently made several statements to the general

<em>&gt; effect that &quot;the U.S. goverment should stop acting in international
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arenas&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Or stop acting the way it does.  The US should just promote freedom by
<br>
reducing its government to a bare minimum -- not acting as a tool for world
<br>
government and propping up unpopular governments worldwide.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, Daniel is someone whom I have an immense amount of respect for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because he has a much better education in areas in which I wish that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my education were as deep as his.
</em><br>
<p>The respect is mutual, though I feel you compliment me too much.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, *purely* from an Extropic perspective, I am going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take my glove and slap him across the face, and say &quot;I challenge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you -- for YOU are not an Extropian&quot;.  The essence of an extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective is the desire to combat entropy -- the diminishment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of information.  What we witnessed recently was a classic example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the destruction of information, both in the minds of individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now dead and in the knowledge bases of commercial enterprises that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are unlikely to survive this incident.  This is an extropic loss on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scale that has probably not been witnessed in the last 45+ years.
</em><br>
<p>I agree and said elsewhere this crime must be punished, but governments, in
<br>
general, increase entropy -- social disorder -- by intervening domestically
<br>
as well as outside their borders.  (Socialism doesn't work at home and it
<br>
sure does not work abroad.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What we have witnessed over the last decade or so in the Balkans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and in Kuwait were similar massive extropic losses (more difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to quantify because of the difficulties of equating loss-of-life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with loss-of-economic-activity).  Furthermore, had we not acted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in those situations they ran the risk of those conflicts expanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into situations that could have significantly impacted the economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health of the USA (resulting in decreased economic growth and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diminishment in the production of information and/or complexity).
</em><br>
<p>Not exactly.  The Balkans conflict had been going on for many years without
<br>
boiling over.  Also, when the US intervened, it mainly intervened against
<br>
Serbia ignoring the atrocities of others, such as Croatia and now the
<br>
various Albanian groups throughout the region.  Granted, Serbia is not an
<br>
angelic, peaceloving society, but the creation of an artificial nation
<br>
[Bosnia] and invading another [Serbia] on a pretext (the actual level of
<br>
killings was in the scores before NATO started bombing, it was 100 of 1000s
<br>
afterward).
<br>
<p>It's also notable that the Israelis and the Palestinians really began
<br>
negotiating in earnest when the first Bush (1989-1993) basically kept his
<br>
main attention off the Israeli-Arab conflict.  (Compare G. H. Bush to his
<br>
predecessors [Nixon, Carter, Reagen] and his successor [Clinton] in terms of
<br>
the level of involvement with Israel.)  My contention is that the
<br>
militants -- typically a very small faction anyhow -- on both sides need or
<br>
want a big power to intervene since it keeps the pot boiling.  Most people
<br>
just can't continue fighting for too long without such support.  Their
<br>
societies can't be in a constant state of war.  Only by outside forces
<br>
supplying money and materiel can this state go on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I've stated before, and I'll state again -- the greatest stain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on past/current governments in terms of &quot;extropic sin&quot; was/is the lack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of intervention in the previous and continuing Central African genocides.
</em><br>
<p>I recall US intervention in Somalia not working.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, if I look back over the last 10-15 years of my life, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how I've allocated my resources, I can make a reasonable case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the U.S. Government has done a better job of allocating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my tax dollars for extropic purposes than I have done with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my non-tax dollars.
</em><br>
<p>By what measure?  Spending on welfare -- corporate or individual?  Spending
<br>
on the war on drugs?  Spending on the FDA which spends a lot of time trying
<br>
to keep working chemicals off the market, especially supplements, while
<br>
basically being a tool for the big drug companies?  Keeping import quotas
<br>
and high tarrifs on cars and trucks so that the American auto industry can
<br>
keep chugging along despite its economic and technological inefficiency?  I
<br>
could go on...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So when I recently discovered that I may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have significantly overpaid my income taxes and may not be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to recover those funds, I could rationalize it without too much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficulty.  For Daniel to be able to support his position, I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he has to make a *strong* case, not only *he*, but a significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of Americans must be better at allocating their resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for extropic purposes than the American government is.  I challenge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him to make that case!
</em><br>
<p>That's a pretty tall order.
<br>
<p>The case is made by economics alone.  The current US government thwarts
<br>
economic growth through inflationary policies (since the government here
<br>
basically controls the banking system through and through), antitrust
<br>
legislation (compare what happened to IBM and the computer industry when the
<br>
US DoJ dropped its antitrust case versus what's happening now to Microsoft
<br>
and ditto), and myriad other regulations made specifically to benefit some
<br>
powerful, vocal group at the expense of everyone else.
<br>
<p>All these policies create a social context where predation not cooperation
<br>
becomes profitable, since it becomes clear to mainly that it's easier to
<br>
take wealth (direct subsidies, restrictions on competitors, or others forced
<br>
to buy your product or service) from the government than to try to create
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not that I think the American government is *trying* to allocate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its resources extropically.  I just think for some reason it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to naturally be able to do so.  It may be some emergent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property of democratic governments.  This may be related to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that individuals can experience &quot;self-gratification&quot; while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments cannot.  Governments can only experience self-preservation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So perhaps self-preservational behaviors have a much greater multiplier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect for extropic production than self-gratification behaviors.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so.  Self-preservation _and_ expansion seem to dominate
<br>
political behavior.  Political power has a tendency to add to itself.  The
<br>
President today has much much more power -- not just in terms of how to deal
<br>
with foreign powers but against citizens domestically -- than did George
<br>
Washington.  This seems true when one looks at any other society.
<br>
Governments grow and grow and grow and grow -- with few exceptions.  And
<br>
they grow not to increase extropy, but for the sake of increasing the
<br>
control and power of people inside them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, I challenge Daniel and other extropians to set aside their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal beliefs (or agendas?) and ask themselves what will maximize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the production of extropic bits?  If you want to stick with your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal agendas, you are going to have to &quot;prove&quot; their worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropically to me.
</em><br>
<p>See above.
<br>
<p>The same applies to you, of course.  Prove your views are valid by any
<br>
standard.
<br>
<p>I'm also shocked that you would ask for this while disregarding what I've
<br>
been posting on this list for the last four years or so.  I've given long
<br>
arguments on a lot of the above issues.  I didn't just wake up yesterday,
<br>
see the World Trade Center crumble, worry about my friends who live and work
<br>
in NYC, and decide to argue for a free society.  I'm not saying I'm the best
<br>
at making this argument, but I've not only presented my views, but also told
<br>
people where to find more information.
<br>
<p>As a side note, how many on this list are emotionally devastated by this
<br>
attack?  I know I am.  I was last in the WTC on September 2nd.  I spent most
<br>
of yesterday in a state of utter disbelief and shock -- though happily I've
<br>
accounted for all my friends and loved ones who lived or worked in the area.
<br>
<p>Later!
