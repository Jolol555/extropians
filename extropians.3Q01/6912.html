I think my response to this can be summed up in: &quot;Robert, what do you
<br>
consider human life and transhumanism to be about?&quot;
<br>
<p>On Sun, Sep 16, 2001 at 10:27:14PM -0700, Robert J. Bradbury wrote:

<em>&gt; First I will respond to Anders:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The ethical is most serious: you assume that human lives can have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; negative value, and do an essentially utilitarian calculation not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of happiness, but simply of utility towards a certain goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anders, first, can you make a reasonable case that lives that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have as a fundamental raison d'etre the elimination of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives do not have a &quot;negative value&quot;?  Second, can you make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case that individuals who openly support or fund individuals who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have as their raison d'etre the elimination of other *innocent*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals from the planet is not of &quot;negative value&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Yes. Even the most vile, destructive human has a positive ethical value,
<br>
which is usually called &quot;human dignity&quot; (I refer to the June archives
<br>
for my posts on this subject). Such a person is worth stopping, but
<br>
deliberately ending his life should never be done unless there are
<br>
absolutely no other ways to handle him. You mix up this form of human
<br>
*ethical* value with the *practical* value a person may have for a
<br>
certain goal (which can indeed be both positive and negative).
<br>
<p>But this is not about whether we would be justified in killing Bin Laden
<br>
if any opportunity presents itself - your post dealt with the deliberate
<br>
genocide of millions of people! Can you claim that every one of these
<br>
people have as their raison d'etre the elimination of other lives? Even
<br>
by your own assumption that human value equals the value to your
<br>
project, you would be bound kill off positive-valued people. And if you
<br>
accept this, why limit yourself to Afghanistan, why not bomb Redmond too
<br>
in order to promote better software development? Can you see where this
<br>
is leading? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Bottom line for me -- lives dedicated to the destruction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other lives (or supporting the destruction of other lives)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are clearly unextropic.  So my previous post on face value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is clearly unextropic.  [NOTE THIS QUITE CAREFULLY -- I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HAVE PROPOSED A POTENTIALLY SELF-CONTRADICTORAY SOLUTION
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AND AM WELL AWARE OF THAT.]
</em><br>
<p>Are you dedicated to the enhancement of other lives or their
<br>
destruction? You cannot enhance other lives by destroying them, and
<br>
destroying lives is only constructive insofar these lives were
<br>
themselves extremely destructive. This is why &quot;non initiation of force&quot;
<br>
is so important - that is the line showing when deadly force may be used
<br>
to stop someone. Just that you don't like them or that they *might*
<br>
become dangerous is not enough. 
<br>
<p>The unextropic aspect of your previous post was not that you wanted to
<br>
kill the evildoers (that *might* be a justified defense), but that you
<br>
had given up hope for 25 million people and were treating them all like
<br>
a hill in the way for your new singularity-railway. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anders continues:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The core idea of transhumanism is human development, so that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can extend our potential immensely and become something new. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is based on the assumption that human life in whatever form it may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be (including potential successor beings) is valuable and worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something in itself. It must not be destroyed, because that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; destroys what transhumanism strives to preserve and enhance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, of course, and if my previous note is read carefully, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should seem apparent that my desire is to maximize &quot;life&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether the proposed strategy to maximize this is *really*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimal is certainly open to significant attack.
</em><br>
<p>I would say most of the posts have pointed out that it is highly
<br>
suboptimal, nearly pessimal. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; However, the discussion of the fastest path to transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the broadest path to transhumanism is not something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be cast aside due to some unsavory bumps along the road.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe you also should ask yourself what kind of transhumanity you want
<br>
to achieve? A transhumanity that emerges out of sacrificing other
<br>
intelligent beings is in my book a Blight. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anders:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Even if some humans are not helpful in achieving transhumanity doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mean their existence is worthless, and if they are an active
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hindrance to your (or anybody elses) plans destroying their lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is always wrong as long as they do not initiate force against you. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, but the key perspective is &quot;as long as they do not initiiate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force against you&quot;.  We are past that point.  They are initiatiating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force against us in an unextropic perspective that seems to involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the support of brain-washed individuals in Afganistan and Pakistan.
</em><br>
<p>How have oppressed Afghani women initiated force against you? By using
<br>
that kind of flexible interpretation of initiation of force you can
<br>
justify anything - if an American murders a Swede I would be justified
<br>
in killing you. But you go further, and suggest that because in your
<br>
estimation there is a high likeliehood of force-initiating individuals
<br>
appearing in a region you are justified in attacking it. Guess who is
<br>
initiating force now, and by the same logic as above should expect
<br>
getting his group being attacked?
<br>
<p>What really disturbs me is that you have not responded to my statement
<br>
of what transhumanism is about. You don't seem to be willing to deal
<br>
with this as an ethical debate, but rather as some kind of cost-benefit
<br>
calculation. But if you don't understand what your values are, what you
<br>
are trying to achieve and how this is valuable, then the calculation
<br>
can't provide an optimal answer. I get the worrying feeling that you
<br>
have just assumed &quot;minimize number of deaths before singularity&quot; to be
<br>
the value and optimization goal, and completely ignored issues of what
<br>
kinds of *lives* there will be. If you sincerely mean that what only
<br>
matters is the number of people, then you have joined ranks with a
<br>
certain guy who said &quot;A few deaths is a tragedy, a million statistics&quot; -
<br>
and your philosophy is likely to lead in the same direction as his. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anders:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The logical mistake is to ignore the full consequences of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; idea, and just look at the &quot;desirable&quot; first-order consequences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What you miss is that if this form of &quot;practical genocide&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; used, then the likeliehood of other forms of &quot;practical genocide&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are becoming far higher and harder to ethically suppress, as well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as resistance to the US or other genocidal group is likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; become *far* more violent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anders, *I* did not, and it would appear the U.S. military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; officials (at least currently) are not, ignoring the potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences of bombing Islamic states.  My statements were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carefully made based on estimates that (a) a backlash would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop; (b) a response to such a backlash would be moderately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective; (c) technologies would develop that would make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire response vs. counter-response irrelevant)
</em><br>
<p>OK, playing along with this game: what about foreign policy? By behaving
<br>
like this, the US would demonstrate to all other nations that it is
<br>
dangerous and willing to use force to achieve its goals even when the
<br>
victim has not attacked it. The logical conclusion for everybody else is
<br>
to view the US as the new rouge nation and start preparing to deal with
<br>
it. Even if China, Russia, the EU and Australia might not share the same
<br>
pre-emptive idea, they would see where the threat lies and act
<br>
accordingly. Hmm, suddenly the concept of MAD begins to rear its ugly
<br>
head, doesn't it? And what happens when nano is being developed in this
<br>
kind of scenario? You can guess - nano-MAD. Say hello to global
<br>
ecophagy. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anders:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This post is going to haunt us all - it is in the archives, it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been sent to hundreds of list participants. Be assured that in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; few years, when the current uproar has settled down, somebody is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; going to drag it out and use it against extropianism in the media.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've heard this from Anders, and I've heard it from Eliezer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (as well as the not small number of messages filling my personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mailbox)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I must only say that I am shocked and amazed.  If one cannot voice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the extropian list thoughts, ideas and opinions that one has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the maximization of the evolution of our society -- then we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are doomed.  We are implicitly stating that ideas exist that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not fit for public consumption or that we would prefer the veneer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of public approval rather than the debate of rigorous, rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion.
</em><br>
<p>No, Robert. I would attack your post just as vigorously even if you had
<br>
sent it to me encrypted for my eyes only, because the things it embodies
<br>
are so vile. That this is a public forum doesn't change anything.
<br>
<p>You might have noted that I put my pessimistic prediction that it would
<br>
haunt us near the end, because compared to the other problems with it
<br>
this was just a minor point. The fact that you seem to be advocating an
<br>
ethics which is as I see it fundamentally incompatible with human
<br>
flourishing is far worse than whether Rifkin gleefully could use the
<br>
post. In fact, I am a bit dismayed to note how many critics of your post
<br>
have merely criticised the consequences of posting it rather than the
<br>
contents, as if they didn't care what was posted on this list or thought
<br>
within the transhumanist memespace as long as it did not touch the
<br>
outside world. That is a very shortsighted view.
<br>
<p>One should be able to voice *anything* to the extropians list, including
<br>
the most vile hate propaganda - but it is our responsibility to rip such
<br>
evil ideas to shreds according to the ideals of transhumanism. If we do
<br>
not do that, and allow them to just fester, then transhumanism will soon
<br>
become a cesspool. It is better to have an open forum where radical
<br>
ideas are freely expressed but also criticized than a closed forum where
<br>
innovation is suppressed for security. This is exactly why we need an
<br>
open society, too.
