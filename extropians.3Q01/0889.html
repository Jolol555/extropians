<p><em>&gt; [on blocking senders]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What I don't understand is why they have to announce it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That seems a might peculiar.  Probably they only want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; offend and insult the party that annoyed them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or perhaps it's a modicum of courtesy to other list members who may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (otherwise) wonder why the offending party's messages are no longer being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engaged. In effect, announcing it says to the whole list: My lack of response
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not to be misconstrued as inability to rejoin, but rather as refusal to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feed the troll.
</em><br>
<p>I had not considered that.  Yes, I know that my usual response is
<br>
simply to pass over posts that I agree with.  So if there was a 
<br>
thread that I was heavily posting on and---up to the moment in
<br>
question---was replying to all the comments that I disagreed with,
<br>
then, yes, perhaps announcing that I was blocking someone might
<br>
be beneficial.  But I'm sure that I've seen some exceptions---
<br>
that is, people coming out of left field merely to announce &quot;PLONK&quot;
<br>
that someone had been kill-filed.  Back to the subject:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An example of someone who affirms religious belief while not being a liar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a fool is... someone who feels personally benefitted by religiosity.
</em><br>
<p>I know that someone just posted something contrary, but I believe
<br>
that the truth is the most important thing, and this doesn't help
<br>
get them off the hook:  if they affirm religious belief, something
<br>
is still wrong.  I'll say what that could be after
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Therefore, I'd amend my previous statement such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that anyone who truly believes in religiosity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a liar, a fool, or a psychological cripple.
</em><br>
<p>:-)  Nobody can call you mealy-mouthed.  I still think
<br>
that it's also possible that they
<br>
<p>(1) are intellectually crippled by lack of skeptical ability
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(and would therefore be easy marks for other scams)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this may not be so different from your &quot;psychological
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cripple&quot; on re-reading
<br>
(2) so convinced of religion's benefit to all peoples and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nations that it clouds their judgment.  They're not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consciously lying, but don't have open minds, either
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Team players&quot; also can fall into this category.  Rush
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limbaugh fits into this category, as is easily seen by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his constant allusions to football and so on.  Such
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people sometimes don't have truth as their number one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priority, and simply have to give mutual support to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their allies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or, as Jessie Ventura reportedly said, &quot;Religion is for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weak-minded people&quot; (which statement ignores liars and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; categorical idiots).
</em><br>
<p>Now I like his statement even more than I used to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If religiosity provides the cognitive crutch that some people need in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do their best, then that's fine. Debunking religiosity doesn't require us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demean those who need and use religion in private.
</em><br>
<p>Why not?  Yes, if people are going to entertain false beliefs,
<br>
I'd of course prefer that they do it in solitude.  But it still
<br>
has to be stated that not only is what they believe false, but
<br>
that there is something very wrong with how they think.
