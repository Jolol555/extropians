<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unrestrained capitalism (think early industrial US) leads to huge

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Uh, the French Revolution was a revolution against the ruling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;class, against aristocracy and subjection by force and the lack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of freedom to one's own life and to rise.  It was in no way a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;revolution against capitalism, unrestrained or otherwise.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, but it *was* a revolution against the &quot;huge discrepancies in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distribution of wealth.&quot;  Which was my point.
</em><br>
<p>No it wasn't. Your point was that the French Revolution was a revolt
<br>
against the 'huge discrepancies of wealth produced by capitalism'. This
<br>
is a false claim, since the vast majority of the wealth owned by those
<br>
in the ruling class was feudalistically gained: by conquest and
<br>
confiscation. In reality, the French Revolution occured specifically
<br>
because there was a rising middle class of earned wealth that had no
<br>
voice in government. It was that unfranchised middle class that created
<br>
the French Revolution.
