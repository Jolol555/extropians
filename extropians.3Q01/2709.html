<p>Yes, and while not every slave received this, a fair number did, most of
<br>
which later abandoned the land for industrial work in the north. Most of
<br>
those who did move to industrial jobs were younger sons who didn't
<br>
inherit those 40 acres to begin with.
<br>
<p>In the post civil war era, there was a significant scandal during
<br>
reconstruction where it was found that former slave holders were using
<br>
local law enforcement to put freed slaves back into a state of peonage
<br>
and to prevent voter registration, as well as passing local laws which
<br>
prevented freed slaves from being armed to defend themselves and their
<br>
land against lynching and seizure of property. Congress put together a
<br>
commission about this matter, which resulted in them proposing what
<br>
became the 14th Amendment, which congress mandated rebel states ratify
<br>
before they would be readmitted to the union, and specifically mandated
<br>
that freed slaves be allowed to arm themselves, and those who failed to
<br>
enforce it lost reconstruction funding. Most southern states refused to
<br>
accept reconstruction funding rather than enforce the 14th amendment
<br>
locally, which is why the south languished economically until WWI.
