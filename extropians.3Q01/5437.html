<em>&gt; The term &quot;recession&quot; measures the health of a country when it is treated as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a business. But what has that to do with the wellbeing of the *citizens* of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the country? Let's look at what should be the perfectly obvious example:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose all citizens of Japan were retired, having saved enough money to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; financially independent. No one at all would be working: the GDP would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach ZERO...the media would be screaming about it. But the *owners* of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the country, its retired citizens, are doing just great.  I really hope this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example brought  home for you just how very disconnected from reality media
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic reporting really is.
</em><br>
<p>This is not accurate. Earnings on investments are 'product' that is
<br>
counted. The problem with systems like Japan's (and other country's)
<br>
welfare systems is that they are not interest bearing instruments, they
<br>
are Ponzi schemes. If Japan had zero workers, all retirees, no retirees
<br>
would be getting any money from their social security system and GDP
<br>
would be zero, but those with pensions that are vested in automated
<br>
industrial output would be making money, and producing 'domestic
<br>
product'.
<br>
<p>Under a retirement system whose funding is entirely tied to industrial
<br>
output and profitability, not to siphoning the earnings of current
<br>
workers, the optimum situation with maximum GDP would be to have no
<br>
workers, because all capital normally spent on training and maintaining
<br>
workers (thus an expense) is instead channeled into production of more
<br>
productive automation, thus earning more profits for the stockholders.
