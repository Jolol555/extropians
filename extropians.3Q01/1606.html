<em>&gt; I would approve of people seeking a middle-ground: we have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; publicly retain the traditions that created success and wealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the first place, but also exercise charity in those local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations about which we are very knowledgable, and judge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it can do some good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>2 thoughts come to mind...
<br>
<p>Any compromise between poison and food, its the poison that wins
<br>
Ayn Rand
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>Always walk on side of road. Left side of road good, right side of road
<br>
good. Walk middle of road *squish* just like grape.
<br>
Little Chinese guy from Karate Kid.
<br>
<p><p>So once you are in this glorious middle ground, what principle do you use to
<br>
guide your decisions? If someone breaks in my house, do I ask their demands
<br>
and only give them half of that? Principles are there to guide you and yes,
<br>
they must be taken to logical extremes. Don't fear extremes though, that's
<br>
simply a unit of measurement. Extreme health, extremely good food, extremely
<br>
good friends are good things. On the other side, extremely lethal poison or
<br>
deadly sharks are bad. Notice, that extreme is contextual. You cant say an
<br>
extremely principled government is bad without a definition of what your
<br>
talking about.
<br>
<p>This dawned on me talking to a co-worker today when I told him about the new
<br>
libertarians mayoral candidate (The guy Kramer is based on from Sienfield,
<br>
yes he's running). He said he believed in freedom, but didn't want to become
<br>
like California with all its &quot;liberal&quot; crazies. He didn't want the people
<br>
that use drugs, prostitutes, and other types that he felt were morally
<br>
opposite. I didn't get a chance to ask him this question because he left
<br>
before I thought about it. My question was.... How does a government
<br>
determine what its people are allowed to do? I'm sure he will not have an
<br>
answer because he doesn't think in terms of principles, and that's the only
<br>
way to answer a question like that. You cant say &quot;whatever the majority
<br>
says&quot;.... You cant say &quot;What ever helps the most people without causing too
<br>
much trouble&quot;. Who gets to define what these things are?
<br>
<p>So here we are having given up the principle that property cannot be taken
<br>
and now we sit back and argue what is the proper amount to take, with no way
<br>
to answer that question... With the result being a slide into socialism,
<br>
then communism, then dictatorship and death (unless the singularity saves
<br>
us!). Well be led down the road to hell with the best intentions, with all
<br>
the people screaming at the wealthy about how greedy they are, for being
<br>
prosperous and not giving their property to those who didn't make it. &quot;The
<br>
little ole ladies NEED it though&quot; they yell, blanking out the fact that they
<br>
destroy the very principles that allowed the wealthy man to gain wealth,
<br>
build companies that employ many people, through productive effort. &quot;But
<br>
single mothers need it for their children&quot; they yell as they destroy the
<br>
only system that gives the children any hope of survival.
<br>
<p>I can only hope that the wise one day can fabricate a place where its
<br>
possible to escape such madness, I can tell you Ill have my resume put in
<br>
with em, and while I'm waiting on the answer, Ill be closing the bank
<br>
account... packing.. and getting the U-haul, cause I would rather sweep
<br>
floors in a free system with the hope of a good future, then to be a slave
<br>
in a system that allows me to have a Lexus till they grow tired of watching
<br>
me drive it, and take it away. Keep arguing over how to split the spoils,
<br>
but just don't plan on holding me hostage forever. First bus out, I'm on it.
