<p>
Ok, I got the article again, went over it and here's what I gathered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'm still waiting on someone to say what the racists statements,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tones, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attitudes have been said here. I haven't heard anyone make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any racists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; statements. I haven't heard anyone say that any particular race was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inherently superior. I've heard bigoted ones, and I've heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discriminatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I know this may seem like nitpicking definitions, but its important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that words keep their meanings else more confusion erupts. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; use the word racist, please have the common courtesy to know what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it means,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and how it differs from bigoted and discriminatory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, please.  This claim is so pathetic.  I can't believe that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anybody really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs to respond to such a demand for evidence.  But for the sake of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completeness, here I go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The article clearly claims that there are inherent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences between &quot;all&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blacks and &quot;all&quot; whites.
</em><br>
<p>I never saw this statement or anything close to it. He makes a lot of
<br>
generalizations, but doesn't point to genetics being the prime factor for
<br>
blacks having a different culture. Is he saying there are differences in
<br>
blacks and whites? Yes. Does he provide the conclusion that these
<br>
differences are genetic in origin or that they are not even repairable. No.
<br>
If there is no conclusion that the differences are genetic in origin, there
<br>
is no racism, only bigotry and discrimination (both of which have their
<br>
places... i.e. He is quite correct to assume that the assaults he knew about
<br>
were in fact NOT from little ole Presbyterian women, although it is possible
<br>
I guess) also, I discriminate against Pepsi every Coke I have based on
<br>
taste.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It clearly paints 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all whites with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one description while painting all blacks with a difference 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The description of the whites is always superior than the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blacks.  
</em><br>
<p>I don't know about the &quot;always&quot; part, I didn't get that, but once again...
<br>
unless their is a determination that genetics are the reason instead of
<br>
culture, there is no racism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Not only does it argue that whites are better, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it claims that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blacks are incapable of duplicating the achievements of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whites.  I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know how the article could be even more racist if it tried.
</em><br>
<p>Didn't see this stated either, could you please provide reference?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Examples:  The article clearly blames welfare, crime, large police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; departments, violence and fear on blacks only.  It claims 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without blacks do not have these problems. 
</em><br>
<p>This statistically may be true (and I didn't see where he blames this on
<br>
them &quot;only&quot;, but once again, cultural or genetics?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It clearly states that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; author could determine the race of the bad teacher by the bad skills,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously because only blacks would show such poor skills 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while whites would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not.
</em><br>
<p>His guess is a result of statistical analysis, even if not done explicitly
<br>
and scientifically, and is instead by examination of certain things he
<br>
witnessed. Once again, no determination if these differences are genetic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The article clearly attributes an unsolved murder and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unsolved thefts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to blacks under the assumptions that whites wouldn't commit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those crimes.
</em><br>
<p>See above comment about little ole ladies... Simple discrimination is not
<br>
inherently without basis. This goes into issues like racial profiling and
<br>
such. Fact is, if it is known that blacks cause 75% of the murders in a
<br>
particular area, and if you are a police, then you would be doing a
<br>
disservice to the victim and future victims if you ignore this data and try
<br>
to put forth &quot;equal&quot; effort into researching ALL racial divisions. Take this
<br>
further, what if we wanted to divide our investigation time on religious
<br>
grounds as well? If there's a murder in a Amish community, you don't go
<br>
looking for Buddhists with the same intensity as you do Amish just to be PC.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The article clearly attributes civilization, science and the wheel to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whites.  It claims that technology, such as Microsoft 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products, are produced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by whites.
</em><br>
<p>Historically correct and there was no indication that the reasons was
<br>
genetic in origin.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, the author claims that blacks are incapable of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; duplicating the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achievements of whites.  He expresses the desire that blacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studying or achieving academic degrees by their own merit, as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if blacks were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incapable of higher learning, and implying that all academic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degrees earned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by blacks were faked.  The author claims that only whites can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels of academic or civilized achievement, while blacks are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incapable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieving the same level.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't see anything even close to this. As a matter of fact, here's one
<br>
statement he made that you seem to be forgetting.
<br>
&lt;snip&gt;I'd love to see blacks study, earn degrees on their merits, prosper.
<br>
Think of the trouble it would save.&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
I honestly think he means this. I don't think he wants an underclass that
<br>
needs constant monitoring and resources being dumped into it. His statement
<br>
about merit I'm sure refers to &quot;affirmative action&quot; programs designed to
<br>
alter the rules for particular races (discriminatory?). Also note the term
<br>
&quot;Prosper&quot;!
<br>
<p>Like I said, I do not believe in the inherent genetic superiority of any
<br>
particular race or races. Everyone is capable of generally the same things
<br>
given the fact we all possess pretty much the same internal equipment.
<br>
<p>Personally, I think the entire article is extremely witty the way it puts
<br>
forth its points. It does so by appearing superficially to be racist, but
<br>
deeper reading show nothing of the kind. You see hatred for blacks in this,
<br>
I see someone that actually would like to see blacks improve their
<br>
condition, I see caring even. The points made are put forth with satire that
<br>
Mark Twain would have been proud of.
<br>
<p>My big hang up on the genetics vs. environmental is of course, there's not a
<br>
lot we can do about genetics (Yet!). Also, if its not genetically based its
<br>
not racist.
