</em><br>
<p>Indeed, but you instantly *plonked*ed back anyway. Samantha, I guess you
<br>
don't appreciate how offensively your post came across.

<p><em>&gt;...does not mean

<p>I certainly read all this on my first pass as deep-coded thus: `Hey, if
<br>
you're not signed up 100 percent to the Charter, piss off out of here, and
<br>
who the hell are you anyway?' So I felt my own finger, too, drawn toward
<br>
the *plonk* key. That was probably an over-reaction, I decided, but still...
