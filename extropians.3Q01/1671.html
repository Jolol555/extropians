<em>&gt; Okay, it's time for me to confess to that also---I would be

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I in good consciience advocate it.  I do so because I
<br>
believe it is essential to our long term wellbeing and
<br>
thriving.  Now, the hard question is how to successfully get
<br>
there.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I think even in a society of guaranteed income, we would see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; most people working to better themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That depends on the people!  Your statements apply to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sets of people in history, but very, very few.  In the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; United States, I don't think that the number of people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would continue working would be adequate, because too many have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very dull, routine jobs, and too many (like me) have better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things to do with their time.  The memes of industriousness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard work, prudence, and self-reliance would have to be a hell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a lot stronger than they are now to make a go of it at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present time.
</em><br>
<p>We hamstring ourselves both when we ignore history and when we
<br>
think that tomorrow is a repeat of yesterday of necessity.  The
<br>
conditions of a truly abundant society of free and open
<br>
information are very different than anything that has goine
<br>
before.  In a society where all the physical necessities of life
<br>
are already present and where there are ample and open
<br>
opportunities to explore and grow there is nothhing left to do
<br>
but better yourself or simply hang out.  The latter eventually
<br>
gets pretty boring.
<br>
<p>Hard work?  I work the hardest for things I truly love, not to
<br>
express some meme.  Why should it be considered &quot;hard&quot;?  Why not
<br>
deeply focused and joyfully engaged in?  Prudence?  There will
<br>
be some reasons for care but the danger of falling into economic
<br>
ruin will not be one of them.  I bit that danger adieu as
<br>
joyously as I bid sickness and death adieu.  Self-reliance?  We
<br>
are all in this together.  Self-responsibility is one thing but
<br>
the notion you can only rely on yourself or that your own caring
<br>
and responsibility extends only to you and the few you claim to
<br>
love is simply not an essential aspect of existence as it is nor
<br>
is it necessary for a healthy and vibrant people.  Of course it
<br>
depends on what you mean by the term.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think it will be an incredible world when because of A.I. and mature nanotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we see homelessness, poverty and lack of good medical care wiped away.  I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like to see housing, power and food become very cheap so that people cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even fathom the way 20th and early 21st century have-nots lived.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, that'll be great.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And I do not see this destroying the traditions of personal responsibility!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; People will just move up on Maslow's pyramid to achieve higher needs and wants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As I have already written here, the desire for status will do us well in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; coming age of incredible prosperity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that you're still talking about people like you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the people you know.  A majority of people will just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-stop party when their ship comes in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I think a lot more people &quot;like us&quot; would be created in that
<br>
kind of world.  Non-stop party gets boring eventually.  Those
<br>
that want to do that can do it to their hearts content with
<br>
little consequence except the boredom and meaninglessness of
<br>
it.  They will burn out on it eventually.
<br>
<p>Now, there is a question in such speculations.  And that is what
<br>
to do with the people who don't want to live in such relatively
<br>
paradisical situations.   Should room be left virtually or
<br>
actually for those who simply insist on living a life where most
<br>
of their time and energy is spent anxiously maintaining a
<br>
&quot;living&quot; and chasing after many things of the &quot;good life&quot; that
<br>
are by design either not obtainable to all or that can
<br>
dissappear so easily as to keep up anxiety levels to make them
<br>
more productive and &quot;industrious&quot;?  Should we keep room for
<br>
those who wish to &quot;make a living&quot; rather than living a life?
