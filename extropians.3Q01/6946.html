<p>Taliban officials fleeing Afghan capital fearing attacks
<br>
<p><p>Officials from Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement have started to flee
<br>
the capital, Kabul, amid growing expectations of US attacks, according to
<br>
witnesses.
<br>
<p>Taliban officials and their families were seen heading out of the city for
<br>
the countryside, but it was not clear if this was under instruction from
<br>
their spiritual leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, they said.
<br>
<p>Those fleeing appeared mainly to be junior commanders and officials. The
<br>
majority of the leadership is based in the southern city of Kandahar.
<br>
<p>Witnesses said hundreds of ordinary residents of the capital were also
<br>
trying to escape.
<br>
<p>Fear of reprisal has triggered a rush to get families out of the cities.
<br>
Thousands of people have flooded over the eastern border to the already
<br>
overflowing refugee camps of Pakistan.
<br>
<p>These who couldn't leave were bracing for war, stocking up on food as prices
<br>
soared and the Afghani currency slid.
<br>
<p>With Iran announcing it was sealing its eastern border with Afghanistan,
<br>
opposition fighters controlling a narrow northern corridor and Pakistan
<br>
pledging to support US anti-terrorism efforts, Kabul residents were feeling
<br>
increasingly vulnerable.
<br>
<p>The spiritual leader of the Taliban movement yesterday called an urgent
<br>
meeting of senior Islamic clerics to discuss the defence of his isolated
<br>
nation and he appealed to Muslim nations for help.
<br>
<p>The Taliban insist neither they nor bin Laden had the capacity to organise
<br>
an international plot that saw trained pilots hijack large passenger jets
<br>
and crash them into the World Trade Centre towers in New York and the
<br>
Pentagon in Washington. (Reuters)
