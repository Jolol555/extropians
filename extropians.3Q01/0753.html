Perhaps

</em><br>
<p>You are right. There is of course nothing about the Flynn effect itself that
<br>
dictates that it is the young getting smarter. The correlation could be
<br>
entirely due to more intelligent geriatrics. But as you know, there is other
<br>
evidence that intelligence increase with the year of birth, e.g., children's
<br>
brain weight in the U.S. increased one SD from the 1920s to the 1970s. (Our
<br>
old friend M. Storfer cites some of this literature).

<em>&gt; Yes, but the areas in which the young are the most resistant to the advice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the old are the areas where knowledge should transfer the best: love,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marriage, friends, children, careers, work ethic, institutional

reliability,
<br>

</em><br>
You may be right about this--it is hard to be sure at this abstract level.
<br>
But I think a lot of the items you cite here have changed drastically in the
<br>
last fifty years, so I don't know what sage advice Grandpa will have.
<br>
Marriages and careers are much more--how shall I put it?--fluid than they
<br>
use to be. Very few got divorced in Grandpa's day, most get divorced now.
<br>
Very few pursue their entire career with the same company today, many did in
<br>
Grandpa's day. Certainly there is a lot more career mobility these days.
<br>
Grandpa may have had different views on raising children--most of us don't
<br>
have a woodshed anymore even if we wanted to heed his advice. I am not sure
<br>
whether Grandpa would understand why one might want to spend so much time
<br>
with your &quot;friends&quot; on the internet rather than Joe six-pack who lives
<br>
&quot;right next door&quot;. We can do all the armchair theorizing we want. Perhaps
<br>
you'll agree that these are ultimately empirical questions.
<br>
Mark.
