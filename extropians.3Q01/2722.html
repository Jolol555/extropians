<em>&gt;Yeah, so far that claim certainly seems exaggerated.  But, Jerry,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you can check out the URLs provided by Al Villalobos yourself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I just found an interesting table (thanks to Al):

</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/wm/58.1/eltis_tab1.html">http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/wm/58.1/eltis_tab1.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;According to that table (it's really very interesting, check it out),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the volume of the transatlantic slave trade from Africa by *carrier*,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;U.S. ships were less than 2.5% of the total.  But from the above table
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(see the very top of this post, not the URL) evidently about 5% of

<em>&gt;the slaves carried across the Atlantic ended up in the U.S.  I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have thought it to be much greater.  I agree, the table is not as clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as it could be (again, see the table quoted at the very top of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;post).  I suppose we can consult exactly where Al got the info, namely

<p>Folks, these statistics are pretty much agreed among the historians right
<br>
now. The very similar figures given by Hugh Thomas in &quot;The Slave Trade&quot; show
<br>
a total of 13 million leaving the African ports which supplied the Atlantic
<br>
slave trade between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries and a total of
<br>
about 11 million arriving in the New World in the same period (Thomas gives
<br>
a good short account of the historiography of these figure on pp 862-3 of
<br>
his book). These figures show that (a) The death rate on the passage was
<br>
about 23% overall. There is an argument that the figure was much higher for
<br>
the Dutch and British than the Portuguese but this is less certain. It does
<br>
seem likely however given the much shorter transit from Africa to Brazil
<br>
compared with the West Indies. (b) The huge majority of slaves went to
<br>
Brazil, the West Indies (French and British) and the Spanish Empire. The
<br>
U.S. (actually the British colonies primarily as the trade was drastically
<br>
reduced after 1806/8) only accounted for 500,000 ie about 4.5% of the total.
<br>
This is low relatively because the overwhelming demand for slave labour came
<br>
from sugar and coffee plantations, or mines (totals of 5 million, 2 million
<br>
and one million respectively). In the U.S. the pricipal demand was for
<br>
cotton labour and domestic service but the latter was not too significant
<br>
because of the constant  flow of white indentured labour from Britain to
<br>
meet that need. Worth also pointing out that sugar plantations in particular
<br>
had a very high death rate among the slaves, hence the much higher levels
<br>
for Brazil and the West Indies. (c) If you are talking about reparations for
<br>
the slave trade then white Americans are way down the list after Brits,
<br>
French, Dutch and Portuguese. Of course there's the separate matter of
<br>
slavery within the U.S..... .Steve Davies
