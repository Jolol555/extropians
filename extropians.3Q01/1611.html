<em>&gt; You're right, I hadn't thought of that angle. Of course it's the rich
</em><br>
(more
<br>

</em><br>
responsibility
<br>
<em>&gt; can enable one to become rich enough to scoff at responsibility of another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind.
</em><br>
<p>I think part of it is character.  Back when I was poor and lived in poor
<br>
neighborhoods -- which is where I've spent most of my life; it's only been
<br>
in the past four years that I've managed to move up a little -- I noticed a
<br>
lot of people who were spendthrifts when they did happen upon any money.
<br>
These people were poor and, I reckon, to them, the extra cash was thought of
<br>
as nothing more than a reason for celebration.  There was no thought about
<br>
putting it away for a rainy day.  I noticed, too, as I moved into the
<br>
workforce, there were people who when they got any extra money, did much the
<br>
same.  Heck, I sometimes did that too.
<br>
<p>Maybe, in some way, there are incentives and disincentives to doing this.
<br>
After all, if savings are heavily taxed or if inflation is high, then
<br>
there's no incentive to put money away and a strong disincentive to spend
<br>
right now.  I do think that has an impact, but I also think that some people
<br>
just don't think long range for whatever reason -- ignorance, ideological
<br>
commitment, genetics, etc. -- and maybe at certain times in their lives
<br>
their behaviour might change.
<br>
<p>A friend of mine, Kevin, is 23 and he's starting to shift from being a
<br>
spendthrift to thinking in terms of his financial future.  I'm not sure what
<br>
made him change.  I also have friends who are older than me, in their early
<br>
30s, who still haven't figured it out.  A lot of them also spend like they
<br>
are rich and wind up just making minimum payments on their credit cards.
<br>
<p>I've also noticed poor people who become rich or just not poor partly
<br>
through frugality and remain frugal.  So, there does seem to be a character
<br>
component.  For instance, I participated in a local philosohy club where the
<br>
meetings are held in the member's homes.  I was astonished to find a friend
<br>
of him, who is rich by my standards, was offering what I considered to be
<br>
cheap -- very low quality -- food at the meeting.  The guy makes about four
<br>
times what I make, but apparently he doesn't spend it on his guests.:)
<br>
<p>Of course, this doesn't refute your claim.
<br>
<p>Happily,
<br>
