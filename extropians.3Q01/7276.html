<p>Okay, I know the feeling. For me, the pisser was that &quot;crusade&quot; gaffe.
<br>
<p>I understand the sentiment. But bear in mind that something like 80% of those polled 
<br>
throughout the world reportedly reply in the affirmative when asked if they believe
<br>
in a supreme being. Remember that subplot of the movie _Contact_.
<br>
<p>Given the above, the short answer is, &quot;Because it's effective rhetoric.&quot;
<br>
<p>You don't have to like it.
<br>
<p>Take a deep breath. Consider having someone you trust provide you with a seven-second
<br>
delay of such broadcasts--they can blank out the offending word(s).
<br>
<p>Or rise above your irritation, just as you would if someone farted noisomely in a
<br>
posh restaurant just as you sat down to eat. What are you hungry for? Take a stroll
<br>
around the grounds until the air clears, and keep on point.
<br>
<p>I consciously adopt the language of my audience. At the end of a recent post, I mentioned God
<br>
even though I'm an agnostic. Was the rest of the content valuable, or rendered valueless?
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the sort of person I preach to.&quot;
