</em><br>
<p>For starters, `Darwinianism' or `Darwinism' is just a metonymy for the
<br>
general theory of natural selection, something that has evolved (as it
<br>
were) and complexified over the last century and a half; Charles Darwin's
<br>
own views are not isomorphic with it, and hence of limited relevance. 
<br>
<p>Still, natural selection is an explanatory system that clearly makes
<br>
vitalism redundant and even ridiculous, as thermodynamics and quantum
<br>
theory make the theory of phlogiston redundant and ridiculous. 
<br>
<p>Does that mean impalpable entities unrestricted by the known laws of
<br>
physics might not attach themselves to animal bodies of sufficient
<br>
complexity, thereby gifting these crude material clods with a `spark' or
<br>
with consciousness? Obviously not. But why stop with anything remotely like
<br>
the classic Western idea of a soul? 
<br>
<p>Why not multiple souls for each person? We are constructed of many cells,
<br>
after all; what if each of them has a separate soul and we are therefore
<br>
each a celestial parliament? That might help explain the inner partitioning
<br>
that modular theories of the self try to account for. 
<br>
<p>Why not posit a hierarchy of souls within the body; one soul for each brain
<br>
module, say, and lesser souls for the limbs, until finally we reach the
<br>
discardable souls associated with hair, toenails and epidermal cells?
<br>
<p>Samantha's right--there's nothing wrong with such ideas at all; their
<br>
potential for almost indefinite proliferation shows the tawdry limitations
<br>
of standard science and theology both!
