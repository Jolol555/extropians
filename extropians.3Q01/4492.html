<p>I think it's a matter of scale. Having one or two clones of you may not
<br>
noticeably reduce your market value, but having tens of thousands almost
<br>
certainly will, since many of them will probably obtain similar skillsets
<br>
as yours. Granted this is mostly a worry for celebrities, but it affects
<br>
everyone since it creates a disincentive for people to become highly
<br>
successful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Copying of you with your complete
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I wasn't talking about nonconsensual copying of minds, but when that
<br>
becomes possible we'll need some way to protect against it as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A simpler possibility would be to add genetic switches expressed in

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>If the cloner knew about this mechanism, he would disable the suicide gene
<br>
prior to nuclear transfer. If he didn't know about it, he would probably
<br>
figure it out after the first couple of cloning attempts failed. So I
<br>
don't think this will work.
