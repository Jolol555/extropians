<br>
<p>Background:  
<br>
<p>At the beginning of the 21st century human achievement is a cause
<br>
for celebration - not least in the fields of scientific enquiry and
<br>
technological application. We live longer, healthier lives than ever
<br>
before and have unlocked many of the great mysteries of the natural
<br>
world. 
<br>
<p>But have we gone too far? Global warming, species extinction,
<br>
genetic experimentation and the unexpected side effects of
<br>
agricultural technology, to name but a few, are recurrent themes in
<br>
newspaper headlines - and in our nightmares. 
<br>
<p>Are scares about modern food and medicines a rational response to a
<br>
world apparently dominated by corporate greed and government
<br>
corruption, or do they express an ill-founded pessimism about human
<br>
achievement? Do the complexities of the natural world demand a more
<br>
precautionary approach, or are we exaggerating uncertainties for
<br>
fear of the future? 
<br>
<p>Have we abandoned the concepts of universal knowledge and
<br>
objectivity for good ? Is there something important about these
<br>
ideas that needs to be rescued? Does the ever-increasing ethical
<br>
scrutiny of scientists' work reflect a more responsible attitude to
<br>
competing interests or an unhelpful politicization of science?
