Lee said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; A quite unnecessary semantic quagmire opens up under us whenever we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; try to discuss the &quot;M&quot; word in the abstract, instead of much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; usefully attacking the things we dislike or think are harmful to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; people, e.g., adultery, disloyalty, brutality, political correctness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; divisiveness, racism, diversity, separatism, zenophobia, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Why is &quot;diversity&quot; on this list?  All things being equal, I *like*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; diversity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That's funny.  Because I was trying to be global in listing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lot of things that people don't like---it's remarkable that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;didn't agree only with one!
</em><br>
<p>I see. Actually, there are a couple  I have reservations about, but
<br>
&quot;diversity&quot; was the one that struck me.
<br>
<p>Let's go through them.
<br>
<p>Adultery: well, I've expressed support from time to time for the principle
<br>
of polyamory, so I obviously have a reservation about this one. However,
<br>
there's no doubt that in many contexts adultery is disloyal and destructive,
<br>
so I didn't quibble about its inclusion.
<br>
<p>Disloyalty: A characteristic I dislike very strongly.
<br>
<p>Brutality: Likewise, almost as much.
<br>
<p>Political correctness: This one is complex, but I generally agree that what
<br>
*I* call political correctness (which we could discuss) is a bad thing.
<br>
However, political correctness is only a sub-set of left-liberal ideas or
<br>
social democratic ones - as you know, I am not opposed to all such ideas.
<br>
<p>Divisiveness: Another hard one. Principled dissent, disagreement and
<br>
argument are good things. But &quot;divisiveness&quot; to me means more than than; it
<br>
means creating division for its own sake, being disruptive, not being a team
<br>
player. I thought that was what you meant and agreed it was a bad thing (ie
<br>
it is something I dislike and invite others to).
<br>
<p>Racism: Something I strongly dislike.
<br>
<p>Diversity: The only one I like without qualification (and it's not the same
<br>
as &quot;divisiveness&quot; as I understand it).
<br>
<p>Separatism: To me this means the idea that indigenous peoples in countries
<br>
such as Australia and the US should form their own countries, separating
<br>
from the Commonwealth or the union. That's what the word usually means over
<br>
here. It might mean something else over there. With that meaning, I think
<br>
it's a lousy idea.
<br>
<p>Xenophobia: I *like* people from other countries.
<br>
<p>So, with a reservation about how we should think about adultery, and with my
<br>
interpretations of what these words mean, I thought this was a pretty good
<br>
list of things to dislike - with the glaring exception of &quot;diversity&quot;.
<br>
<p>Sorry to misinterpret your meaning.
<br>
