<p>I see nothing wrong with such a question, but then all of you ignored my
<br>
Tuesday, August 28, 2001 9:24 PM post comparing Kuhn and Thagard...
<br>
<p>Part of the problem, of course, is what is meant by &quot;paradigm shifts&quot; and
<br>
how they occur.  Kuhn presents a theory of this, Paul Thagard presents an
<br>
alternative view.  Specifically, Thagard rejects the inconmensurability
<br>
thesis.  He backs this up by considering several episodes from the history
<br>
of science, including Lavoisier's oxygen hypthesis and Wegener's theory of
<br>
continental drift.  His more recent book, _How Scientists Explain Disease_,
<br>
extends some of the arguments, though by no means is his work merely a
<br>
criticism of Kuhn and sociology of knowledge.
<br>
<p>That aside, does this mean scientists always moves forward and never make
<br>
big mistakes in understanding?  I would think not, though I disagree with
<br>
any radical claims that we can never know anything or that we are radically
<br>
determined by our historical or social contexts.  Such claims are
<br>
self-refuting...
<br>
<p>I think all interested would benefit from reading Thagard, especially his
<br>
_Conceptual Revolutions_.  (See the URL at the end of this post for my
<br>
review of it.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
