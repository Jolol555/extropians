<p>I&gt;I think I'm proposing something different to James, which is that I think
<br>
<em>&gt;the public school system should probably be privatised, while government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;funding remains intact. But what we are both saying is that the decision to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fund only a single style of school, &quot;public schools&quot;, makes it very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difficult for alternatives to exist, unless the target market of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alternatives are not sensitive to price (or in fact use the price as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;status symbol).
</em><br>
<p>It's easy. Education is a public good. I have no difficulty with public
<br>
funding for it. If we're all that worried about competition, okay, let's
<br>
make it competitive and set up a voucher system. In practice, public higher
<br>
education institutions are operating in an environment damn close to this
<br>
already.
<br>
<p>That said, my observation is that private schools are good at spoonfeeding
<br>
kids for exams but don't necessarily teach them the important skills of how
<br>
to teach themselves. Once they get to university, the brighter public school
<br>
kids cream 'em.
