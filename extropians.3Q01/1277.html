<p><p>There are two problems with your general comments.  First, how do you define
<br>
&quot;more expensive&quot;?  Someone is paying for your healthcare, even if it doesn't
<br>
come directly out of your pocket every time you make a visit.  The illusion
<br>
of &quot;cheap&quot; or &quot;free&quot; government services is the most tantalizing part of
<br>
socialism but it is still an illusion.  Just because the Department of Motor
<br>
Vehicles charges me $150 to drive my car on public roads doesn't mean that
<br>
that is how much I pay for roads ever year; the roads are largely paid for
<br>
by hidden taxes on various goods and services that cost me much, much more
<br>
than $150 even though I never see the bill.  Same thing applies to your
<br>
&quot;cheap&quot; public healthcare.
<br>
<p>Second, price isn't everything.  The range and availability of advanced
<br>
medicine for people matters too.  I'm sure the docs in Mozambique will fix a
<br>
broken leg for bargain price and do a good job of it, but good luck if you
<br>
have an unusual condition or need medical care RIGHT NOW.  Canada supposedly
<br>
has one of the finest socialized medical systems around, yet Canadians flock
<br>
to the USA for medical treatment if they need anything other than relatively
<br>
routine care.  If I had an unusual or life threatening condition, I can't
<br>
think of another country I would rather get my health care in than private
<br>
medical practices in the US.
<br>
<p>I think the biggest difference between the socialized health care system and
<br>
the US health care system is that people in the US see a bill that is closer
<br>
to the real cost, rather than a bill that merely looks small due to
<br>
obfuscatory government accounting.
