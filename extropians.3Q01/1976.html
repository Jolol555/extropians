Just for the record, the report was an email from a very good friend of mine
<br>
who is traveling in Europe at the moment.  It was not a &quot;propaganda message&quot;
<br>
from some &quot;group&quot; fabricating and exaggerating events.
<br>
<p>I can understand Mike's skepticism, especially given the nature of the
<br>
reports by the popular media depicting the protesters as gruesomely violent.
<br>
I can understand his distaste for their cause if he disagrees with their
<br>
goals or their motivations.
<br>
<p>However, I see he is quick to dismiss my friend's report as &quot;manufactured
<br>
propaganda&quot; and assume that reports of police brutality are merely &quot;rumors&quot;.
<br>
With the sorry excuse for journalism that CNN uses to report the incident,
<br>
and with the police attack and sabotage of the independent media's footage,
<br>
and with the knee-jerk dismissals of individual reports as &quot;manufactured
<br>
propaganda&quot;, I don't see how one could be truly informed of what really went
<br>
on at Genoa.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Leonardo,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the standard sort of manufactured propaganda message these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups post, fabricating much and exaggerating even more, writing in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; semantically inflammatory way. I've attended protests here in the US by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these groups and seen these posts afterward, claiming all sorts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police atrocities that never happened. In instances where police got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical, it was only after some of the most vicious and violent baiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have ever seen done. What would you do if you had 1000 people yelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and screaming in your face, calling you all sorts of things, insulting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything about you and your family and your profession, spitting and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throwing rotten food at you from a few feet away, and you had to sit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there and take it for hours on end???? Frankly, I'm disgusted with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protesters, they deserve whatever the police throw at them, the way they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behave.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The behavior of the protesters as I've described is INTENTIONAL, btw. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a standard tactic taught at protest boot camps like those run by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ruckus Society and other groups. Their entire purpose is to push the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police to the point where the police strike back in self defense and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frustration. Once one incident occurs, they then run rumors down the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; line of women getting beaten, raped, etc etc etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Similarly, the protest organizers pass around drugs to protesters that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are mood altering: pot with high THC and low CBD levels, mushrooms and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other hallucinogens. Use of these substances is well documented to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective as battle drugs (they were used against the British
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successfully at a key battle against the Zulu in the 19th century,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wiping out a superior force with nothing but clubs and spears, and drug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crazed warriors). The use of these drugs helps to raise up the battle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fever among protesters.

<em>&gt; &gt; Hello-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  The last few days have been very intense and eye
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opening. I am in Genova where many people from around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the world have shown up to peacefully demonstrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; against the Fascist G8. The news you will hear in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; US will most likely be very distorted and I think you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should know what really went on.
