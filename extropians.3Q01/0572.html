Hi, all! I got this off the Extropy website and wonder
<br>
at this point what it all means to us. I realize that
<br>
I am pretty green on this list, and that we should not
<br>
all believe everything we read, but I think you
<br>
understand the source and nature my questioning.
<br>
<p>1. Perpetual Progress — Seeking more intelligence,
<br>
wisdom, and effectiveness, an indefinite lifespan, and
<br>
the removal of political, cultural, biological, and
<br>
psychological limits to self-actualization and
<br>
self-realization. Perpetually overcoming constraints
<br>
on our progress and possibilities. Expanding into the
<br>
universe and advancing without end.
<br>
<p>2. Self-Transformation — Affirming continual moral,
<br>
intellectual, and physical self-improvement, through
<br>
critical and creative thinking, personal
<br>
responsibility, and experimentation. Seeking
<br>
biological and neurological augmentation along with
<br>
emotional and psychological refinement.
<br>
<p>3. Practical Optimism — Fueling action with positive
<br>
expectations. Adopting a rational, action-based
<br>
optimism, in place of both blind faith and stagnant
<br>
pessimism.
<br>
<p>4. Intelligent Technology — Applying science and
<br>
technology creatively to transcend &quot;natural&quot; limits
<br>
imposed by our biological heritage, culture, and
<br>
environment. Seeing technology not as an end in itself
<br>
but as an effective means towards the improvement of
<br>
life.
<br>
<p>5. Open Society — Supporting social orders that foster
<br>
freedom of speech, freedom of action, and
<br>
experimentation. Opposing authoritarian social control
<br>
and favoring the rule of law and decentralization of
<br>
power. Preferring bargaining over battling, and
<br>
exchange over compulsion. Openness to improvement
<br>
rather than a static utopia.
<br>
<p>6. Self-Direction — Seeking independent thinking,
<br>
individual freedom, personal responsibility,
<br>
self-direction, self-esteem, and respect for others.
<br>
<p>7. Rational Thinking — Favoring reason over blind
<br>
faith and questioning over dogma. Remaining open to
<br>
challenges to our beliefs and practices in pursuit of
<br>
perpetual improvement. Welcoming criticism of our
<br>
existing beliefs while being open to new ideas.
