</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I disagree with this characterization.  One hears a great deal
<br>
besides &quot;excuses for misbehavior&quot;.  There are many reasons for
<br>
misbehavior,  but they are not excuses nor are they
<br>
inescapable.  Why over-generalize?  It doesn't make what you
<br>
want to display stronger.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Now I am *NOT* disputing that these may be (or may not be) *correct*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanations; what I am criticizing is that the old maxims of personal
</em><br>

<p>I disagree.  We are simply putting responsibility in context and
<br>
understanding what is at work besides just uncaused choice (if
<br>
there is such a thing).  The knowing that you can choose, the
<br>
power to choose is something many do not yet realize in their
<br>
own life.  Some of them can be helped to realize it.  All could,
<br>
I believe, if there was time and room enough.  One thing we can
<br>
do is make the time and the room and tools to help reknit
<br>
people.  If we wish to help that is.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;homeless,

</em><br>
<p>I have been homeless (in my late teenage years).  I was
<br>
certainly mistaken about many things but I was not deserving of
<br>
simply having people turn their back completely.  If enough had
<br>
not provided a small safety net I might well not be here. 
<br>
Please consider that when you think on these things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; to guarantee that if you are struck in a roadway you'll be provided

</em><br>
<p>No.  The memes that help the individuals and the groups and the
<br>
communities are ones that include caring for and taking care of
<br>
one another to the extent we can.  Rampant individual darwinism
<br>
did not get us here alone and it is certainly not sufficient or
<br>
even livable for what is to come.
