<em>&gt; FDA, making their approval a non-binding accreditation, awarding a seal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approval, rather than the compulsory application for the right to market and

</em><br>
<p>Couldn't this kind of studies be funded commercially? I see several
<br>
possible sources of income. First, private health information services
<br>
would like to be first with useful decision heuristics, especially if they
<br>
can gain from people referring to these studies (a reliable information
<br>
service would likely have to give literature citations to remain accredited
<br>
and convincing, so even when competing services refer to &quot;drug X is better
<br>
than Y&quot; they would have to include links to the originating/sponsoring
<br>
service). Second, many drug companies would be interested in efficacy
<br>
trials (sure, they might risk having the worse drug, but not supporting a
<br>
trial could be even worse PR). Third, of course all the current non-profit
<br>
organisations would still likely be interested in funding some of these
<br>
studies: everything from the NIH to patient organisations.  The testing
<br>
could be handled by a third party testing organisation to minimize bias,
<br>
perhaps with standardized oversight and procedures.
<br>
<p>Also, the cost of these studies might be decreased using technological
<br>
means. I think Halperin had a very intriguing idea in _The Truth Machine_
<br>
about commercial health monitors with an opt-in program enabling massive
<br>
data mining of population health. Solutions like that could enable 
<br>
large sample sizes with less overhead. It should be possible to come up
<br>
with clever ways of handling double-blind testing of drugs similarly.
