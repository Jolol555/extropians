Cryonet Message #17199 From: Ettinger
<br>
Subject: Free will and responsibility
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It is a never-ending source of amazement that bright people can make the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simplest and grossest mistakes--and that, no matter what you say or how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clearly you say it, someone will misunderstand it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to be a member of Mensa, an organisation where even the village
<br>
idiot has to have an IQ in the top 2% to join. People on welfare showed up
<br>
at meetings. People who were apparently mentally ill showed up. One even
<br>
boasted about how crazy &quot;it&quot; was. In short lots of people showed up who
<br>
could not add two plus two and reliably get an answer of four. I am no
<br>
longer a member of Mensa.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience forced me to make a clear distinction between IQ and
<br>
common sense. If the entire population suddenly acquired ten extra IQ
<br>
points, nothing much would change. If the entire population suddenly was
<br>
gifted with 10 extra common sense points, our society would be
<br>
transformed overnight. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bums in the street would vanish, because begging is a harder way to
<br>
acquire funds, than working a job. Crime would plummet, because in the
<br>
long run crime usually really doesn't pay. Strife at the office, at home,
<br>
and at school would be reduced because it is pointless. The economy would
<br>
boom, everybody would be happy, there would be no more wars, etc, etc. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The business world knows this. An analog of common sense called
<br>
Emotional Quotient (EQ) has been found to be correlated with business
<br>
success, while IQ is not. In the real world nothing can substitute for
<br>
good sound judgement. Unfortunately some people have it, while others do
<br>
not.
