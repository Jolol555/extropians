</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Simple ignorance and general fear of the un-understood is a much

<em>&gt; Well, I'm not religion-bashing when I say that it is just a fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traditional religious people have been at the forefront of the anti-cloning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; push. Leon R. Kass, for example, is quite upfront about his religious faith.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We know that Kass has influence with Dubya, who's commissioned his advice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hey, we've seen the Pope himself getting in Dubya's ear about stem cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research in the past few days.
</em><br>
<p>I was not trying to say that there were no religious people (or
<br>
at least people who claim to be &quot;religious&quot;) at work in this. 
<br>
But I do not believe for a second that this setback should be
<br>
attributed principally to such persons and groups.  Ignorance is
<br>
a far larger force with honest fear of what technology may bring
<br>
not far behind. 
<br>
<p>Many religious people have no problem at all with most medical
<br>
usages of cloning technology.  In fact many of us celebrate that
<br>
such powerful techniques are now available.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've been following this very closely and the evidence is just overwhelming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the main intellectual dynamo of anti-cloning ideas is the Catholic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Church, but also other churches and people associated with them. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximately the same people who are anti-abortion and anti-gay.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The Catholic church, as opposed to many Catholics especially in
<br>
America.  The Church holds positions many Catholics concern
<br>
abhorrent and outmoded.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Samantha, you've just got to read the literature, follow the debate, see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; key players, to observe the crucial role of religious leaders and thinkers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't deny the role some of these people play.  It is just
<br>
extremely dangerous to cast these issues as a religion vs.
<br>
technology and futurism.  This tends to polarize the discussion
<br>
in ways that may lose a lot of people who are on the side of
<br>
progress in this.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; That doesn't mean that *all* people with religious beliefs are anti-cloning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or that there are not others who are also culpable. Some science fiction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writers, sensationalist journalists, anti-science secular intellectuals of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various kinds etc also have a lot to answer for. But I think it makes good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense to view the draconian laws being proposed at the moment in liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracies such as the US and Australia as essentially theocratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legislation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is a HUGE error.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In religious communities, the view you describe as &quot;kooky&quot; is actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainstream. Those of us who are not opposed to therapeutic cloning are
</em><br>
<p>No.  It is not.  I have never ever sat in any church and heard
<br>
anyone propose that this country be run as a theocracy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; considered the kooky ones. Those of us who are opposed to criminal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prohibitions on reproductive cloning and would consider it an ethically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptable practice if it could be developed to a point of being safe are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even kookier, in their eyes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There is no point in such statements.  They are empty assertions
<br>
that only increase the level of tension.  They do nothing to
<br>
heal and overcome the fears and posturings that are against
<br>
these techniques.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I don't want to go through life considering every religious person to be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemy. In fact, as you know, that isn't how I think. But we have to face the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that we're seeing the beginning of a holy war on transhumanist values,
</em><br>
<p>Not unless you wish to cast it as one.  I don't think that would
<br>
be a very good idea.  As I've said before, the
<br>
religious/spiritual aspirations can be  wedded to transhumanist
<br>
goals.  To the extent this can be done and is done this would be
<br>
a very powerful enabler for a transcendent future on this
<br>
planet.  But we can't get there by casting religion in the anti-
<br>
box from the get-go.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; ideas and aspirations. Kass called for this pretty damn explicitly in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; latest article in _The New Republic_ (I posted the URL for this a few weeks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back so you can check for yourself how far I may be exaggerating).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you, Samantha, or anyone else here could find ways to communicate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who have religious beliefs/spiritual yearnings and maybe break down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sense of unanimity among them, that would be wonderful. Please, by all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means, do whatever you can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There is no sense of unanimity.  And I am very much working on
<br>
understanding the problem and finding ways of working with those
<br>
religious/spiritual people that I can.  There have to be many of
<br>
us who want the promises of these religions to be made real on
<br>
this earth and who are willing to work to make that so.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; But I think it's wishful thinking if you don't accept that ideas which are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inimical to our aspirations are the mainstream approach in religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communities and organisations. Moreover, these ideas have enormous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence, including with politicians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do not mistake the words of Rome or a few well-financed
<br>
arch-conservatives for a religious mainstream.   They are not. 
<br>
They are doubtless a lot closer to being mainstream than my
<br>
words however. But there are many, many adherents of various
<br>
religions who do their own thinking regardless of what the popes
<br>
and public voices of their religion say.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If we have to fight these people head-on in the short or medium term, we'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lose. Unlike J.R., I don't think it's a priority to debunk religiosity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (though I'm happy to do a bit of this around the edges, I admit). If we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do *that* to make our case, we're already dead (to use an appropriate way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of speaking). Religion is just too popular (we could go into the reasons for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this, but that's not immediately relevant).
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  So dangerous as it is (and which I know well firsthand),
<br>
imho some of us need to harness some of its power to
<br>
transformation of this world using science and technology but
<br>
hand-in-hand with the best of its own ethics and motivational
<br>
power.   We must not let the entire force of religion be set
<br>
against the future.  That would be a huge disaster.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think we have to put forward strong arguments for the liberal ideal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society in which freedom is paramount and nothing gets banned because of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufactured consensus on moral or theological ideas. If we can win, or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hold our own, in *that* debate, it's sufficient. We have to speak up in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every forum that will give us a voice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So instead everything is permitted even if it will change
<br>
everything and destroy what many belief is the very heart of
<br>
life?  All must be permitted even if it will directly jeopardize
<br>
the continued existence of the entire species?  That is a pretty
<br>
radical idea there.  It is about as heavy as it gets.  Are we
<br>
strong enough for that weight?  I would at least hope that we
<br>
are very familiar with and steeped in moral considerations as we
<br>
go about determining the shape of what is to come.  We are
<br>
planning to &quot;manufacture&quot; our evolutionary descendants.  I don't
<br>
think we can claim some moral high ground toward others
<br>
&quot;manufacturing&quot; ideas and counter-movements based upon them that
<br>
will oppose such plans.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; We don't need to convert the masses to transhumanism. I'll take my chances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of getting the high-tech society I want if the liberal framework is there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for people to make their own decisions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This raises a point that troubles me.  If what some of us think
<br>
is correct, then us getting the high-tech society we want
<br>
changes the world irrevocably for all people on earth regardless
<br>
of what they want.  So what precisely is liberal about choosing
<br>
for everyone?  If we are and must choose then shouldn't we be
<br>
really sure we understand the gravity of what we are about and
<br>
that we truly do it for the maximal good of all those lives that
<br>
will change as we possibly can?
