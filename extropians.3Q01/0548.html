<p>Ouch! I gotta argue with that.
<br>
A scanned mind should work just like the original. The substrate should 
<br>
make no difference to its actual operation. That is the whole idea, of 
<br>
course, to copying yourself into a machine in the first place. The copying 
<br>
process would take any tolerant attitudes or psychoses with it.
<br>
<p>Once your mind is in there you can indulge in a little self betterment, 
<br>
tweaking your numeracy skills, improving your memory, enlarging the pattern 
<br>
recognition area in what was your visual cortex... but that happens later, 
<br>
and only if desired.

<p>I doubt that screwy belief systems can ever be guarded against in the 
<br>
upload process. Their brain structure almost certainly &quot;looks&quot; the same as 
<br>
those that support rational thought patterns. In fact putting such 
<br>
safeguards in place would themselves probably be a very dangerous thing, 
<br>
able to be too easily perverted. (No gay guys or lesbians can upload as 
<br>
they are obviously sick, as are socialists, and blacks and Jews are 
<br>
subhuman so are not worth the space. Ugh!! You can see how this could go.)
<br>
<p>But you shouldn't need to guard against people wanting to upload anyway. 
<br>
Once there, they have an infinity of infinite virtual universes available 
<br>
to them. There is little possibility of clashes for resources as the 
<br>
virtual worlds would enable them to live quite literally as gods. Most 
<br>
won't need or want to know about the outside world.
<br>
<p>Back in the &quot;real&quot; world: does anybody seriously expect that the human race 
<br>
that instantly puts down any dog that dares to bite a human will ever 
<br>
tolerate any machine intelligence that even raises its voice to humans? 
<br>
There is no way that AIs will ever be allowed to become a threat to humans. 
<br>
They will supersede humanity quietly, in spite of their best efforts to 
<br>
help us. We need never worry about force. We are much more likely to be 
<br>
pampered to oblivion.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
