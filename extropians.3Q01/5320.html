<p>Don't &quot;thnk&quot; too hard!  :-)
<br>
<p>For those who haven't met him, Louis is my brother.  We are identical mirror
<br>
twins, but don't make the mistake of assuming that we probably have the same
<br>
politics or attitudes.  Despite some of the discussions around here,
<br>
genetics don't dictate everything.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I also think you have an inflated idea of what a hate crime is.  Hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; give tougher sentences on criminals who commit violent crimes.  They do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; arrest people for mere words or ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would disagree with this.  The hate crime law does not give tougher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentences based on the violence of the crime.  They give tougher sentences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on what the perp was thinking.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that the sentence is based on what the perp was thinking.  More
<br>
specifically, they give tougher crimes based on &quot;intent&quot;.  This is the same
<br>
as drug laws that punish drug possessors with &quot;intent&quot; to sell.  It is hard
<br>
to prove intent.
<br>
<p>My point was that hate-crime laws are not equal-rights laws.  They do not
<br>
give extra positive things to minorities.  Instead, they give extra negative
<br>
things to criminals.  It would be more direct to argue whether criminals
<br>
deserve these harsher sentences rather then to argue whether minorities
<br>
deserve the &quot;perks&quot;.
<br>
<p>The original comment I was referencing claimed that hate crimes laws equaled
<br>
extra rights for gays or blacks.  Hate-crime laws were raised as an example
<br>
of how gays are getting more rights than straights under equal-rights laws.
<br>
My point was that these are not equal rights laws, they are tougher
<br>
sentencing laws.  They do not give anything to gays or blacks.  They give
<br>
something (negative) to convicted criminals.
