<em>&gt; &gt; Actually, nuke plants with a containment are claimed to be engineered to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *Claimed* to be.... That`s the problem. Maybe the US nuclear plants are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safe, which I cannot believe. German Environment secretary said last week,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case of a Boeing 747 crash, the containment of Biblis nuclear plant near the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; city of Frankfurt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might prevent a meltdown, but is not supposed to provide an overall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protection. German Government always boasted of having built the safest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plants in the world. And lately built plants do have a concrete shield of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost 2 meters and might withstand a plane crash, but Biblis doesn`t seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be safe at all. And it is the most dangerous reactor in the heart of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as far as population density is concerned.
</em><br>
<p>I see a bunch of assertions.  Where are the facts? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The attacks on nuclear plants are a serious problem. And obviously no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Government official has ever thought about an *intentionally initiated*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crash. Imagine a Boeing 747, heading from Frankfurt to the USA is going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be hijacked and with the full load of fuel is flown at full speed into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Biblis containment. I bet the concrete shield will not withstand that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impact.
</em><br>
<p>How is this obvious?  Again, stopping plane hijacking and use as
<br>
missiles is just not that hard a problem.  Certainly not hard
<br>
enough to risk WWIII by continuing screwing around in the
<br>
MidEast just for the sake of a little oil.
