<p><em>&gt; Grasshopper:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have to allow for metaphors and a few enigmas in the Bible. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example what is the Biblical &quot;unicorn&quot;? And, is the Book of Jonah one long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Divine comedy? I laugh a lot when I read it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; POC
</em><br>
<p>Party, granted the book of Jonah is a drama/comedy, as is the book of
<br>
Job.  The bible surely contains other plays besides these.  Suspect the
<br>
reason these books made it into the bible is that there were plenty
<br>
of copies made, from the time it was first written, so that the actors
<br>
could memorize their lines.
<br>
<p>Regarding the biblical unicorn, mentioned 9 times in the old testament,
<br>
the term was translated from the Hebrew rem or re'em, and is now
<br>
thought to be a reference to the wild ox.   Caesar found these in
<br>
Gaul and described them as follows:  &quot;These re'em are scarcely  less
<br>
than elephants in size, but in their nature, color and form are bulls.
<br>
Great is their strength and great is their speed...  The size and shape
<br>
of their horns are very different from our oxen.&quot;
<br>
<p>I have even heard the speculation that the notion of unicorns came
<br>
about from traveler's descriptions of the rhinoceros.  The notion
<br>
of a horse with one horn poking out of its forehead is a modern
<br>
invention, modern meaning in the time frame of the 1610 translation
<br>
of the King James bible.
<br>
<p>Regarding snake handling, Ill pass on a bit of wisdom.  Poisonous
<br>
snakes have evolved the technique of coiling up and striking from
<br>
that posture.  They can strike fairly accurately at a distance of up
<br>
to about a third to perhaps half their length, if coiled.  If a snake is
<br>
not coiled, it cannot effectively strike, or at least not hit a target.
<br>
<p>When a snake is picked up in the middle or aft of middle, its primitive
<br>
reptilian brain has never developed (for some curious reason) the
<br>
reasoning ability to figure out which muscles to fire in order to reach
<br>
over and bite you.  It may accidentally get it right, so I am not
<br>
suggesting you pick up a snake.  Please do not test this out by
<br>
grabbing the next available snake.  I am suggesting how the religious
<br>
zealots do it.
<br>
<p>Even Non-poisonous snakes sometimes attempt to bite in self
<br>
defense.  I have handled non-poisonous snakes, and they too
<br>
seem to get a bit confused when you pick them up off the ground.
<br>
If you ever see a video of snake handlers, notice that they do not
<br>
grab the snake and leave him on the ground, for then it might be
<br>
able to reach back and bite.  They grab the snake and pick it
<br>
up.  Then it kinda hangs there wondering what to do next.
<br>
But do leave it to the religious zealots, for they are many and
<br>
extropians are few.
