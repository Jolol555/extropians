<em>&gt; How They Won and How Winning Changed Their Lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also see the article:   Inheritance and Sloth by James K. Glassman, in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; October 11, 1999 of Forbes.  Some excerpts:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What happens when someone gets a barrel full of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cash he hasn't earned himself? Does he work less, work the same, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work more? &quot;What we found was that the more you get thrown at you, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more likely you are to get out of the labor force. And, if you stay in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the labor force, you work less.&quot; The research, published in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quarterly Journal of Economics in May 1993, concluded that Carnegie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was right. &quot;For example, a single person who receives an inheritance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of about $150,000 is four times more likely to leave the labor force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a person with an inheritance below $25,000.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>Well, DUH. How likely are you to be able to do much more with less than
<br>
$25k than pay off debts and/or buy a new car? There is no incentive to
<br>
leave the labor force with such a small inheritance.
<br>
<p>I'd also like to see what they mean by 'leaving the labor force'. Do
<br>
they mean that the individual permanently retired? I doubt it, for
<br>
$150,000. Did they instead start a small business? I suppose if you are
<br>
a business owner, you are not considered a 'worker' per se, but it
<br>
hardly means you've stopped working, you've just stopped working for
<br>
other people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the story
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't end there. A year later, the trio, using the same data,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; published another paper, this time in the Journal of Political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Economy. The second piece of research looked only at entrepreneurs who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; received inheritances. The question this time was whether they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more likely to stay in business for themselves if they received large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bequests. The answer: Yes! The authors found that 32.6% of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entrepreneurs who received small inheritances were out of business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; four years later, but the attrition rate fell to 23.5% for those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; received more than $150,000.  (These figures are in 1982 dollars; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent sums today are $43,000 and $260,000.) More striking, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revenues of companies run by entrepreneurs who received bigger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inheritances grew 20% faster.
</em><br>
<p>Another 'well, DUH' conclusion. This doesn't say anything about
<br>
lotteries, though.
