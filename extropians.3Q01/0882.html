<p>
Samantha and Amara have defended spirituality, synchronicity,
<br>
and (I think) religiosity.  I want to get down to the truth
<br>
of what's really going on here.
<br>
<p>I had a friend over the course of a couple of decades who
<br>
did the same thing.  Despite having some of the deepest
<br>
conversations of my life with him, I never did understand
<br>
why.  Perhaps the answer will emerge in this medium.  Perhaps
<br>
an answer will emerge if we try.
<br>
<p>To me the questions are,
<br>
<p>1. Why do some people gladly debunk what they see as clear
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;falsehoods where others, equally skeptical, don't want to?
<br>
<p>2. Why do the latter embrace terms, e.g., &quot;spirituality&quot; and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;synchronicity&quot; overwhelmingly used by people who mean
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things completely different from them?
<br>
<p>About the latter question, there is no shortage of words and
<br>
phrases in English to distinguish shades of belief.  Articulate
<br>
people (which these people invariably are) could easily always
<br>
find suitable substitution phrases---but they didn't do so, and
<br>
mostly resist doing so.  Why?
<br>
<p>Now a semanticist might retort, &quot;because the term in question
<br>
has so many favorable semantic links, that it's very useful
<br>
for the purposes of communication&quot;.  But if this were the case,
<br>
then you'd see people who use terms like &quot;God&quot;, &quot;spirituality&quot;,
<br>
and &quot;synchronicity&quot; qualifying their remarks.  In other words,
<br>
the terms would always be followed by words like &quot;in the sense
<br>
of...&quot;, or &quot;-like&quot;, or surrounded by scare-quotes.  But it 
<br>
doesn't happen.  Why?  (Apologies to Samantha here: she has
<br>
made it clear that she does have a lot of beliefs that are
<br>
pretty far away from materialism---beliefs not supported by
<br>
any scientific theories.)
<br>
<p>So can anyone explain what is going on?
<br>
<p>Lee
