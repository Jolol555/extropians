<em>&gt; Are you saying that they aren't thinking it through at a deep enough

</em><br>
<p>Whom, the chemists? They're very aware of it, because it is one of the
<br>
factors which can dominate yield, and push a reaction quantitively towards
<br>
and undesired alternative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Molecular Receptor Engineering, esp. 3.5.5 regarding the limits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of atomic positional accuracy.
</em><br>
<p>I've just skimmed it. It's not about diamondoid receptor design, it's
<br>
mostly about the bulk around the cavity, and the supporting structure
<br>
inferring sufficient rigidity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes, but you're not trying to make deep cages, and you're not trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stick stuff to a surface.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can assemble deep cages from the inside out and sticking a methyl
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group onto a molecule *is* sticking it on the surface.  I *will*
</em><br>
<p>Curved surface, as a shallow cage is all surface. Nature doesn't do highly
<br>
crosslinked polymers the enzyme way, because the enzyme can't bind to the
<br>
surface of the reactive moiety without interfering with the structure it
<br>
is depositing upon, plus each deposition changes the surface and thus
<br>
makes complementary binding by a single enzyme impossible.
<br>
<p>Plus, of course, once deposited, crosslinked structures are a bitch to
<br>
remove, especially in a defined way, so you can consider them to drop down
<br>
like bricks outside of the homeostatic equilibrium, once made.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; admit there are going to be some very difficult, perhaps even impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assembly problems without a programmable nanoassembler.  But the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phase space of what you can assemble by tacking things onto each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other or assembling things as nested hierarchies would seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be some reasonable subset of what you can assemble atom by atom.
</em><br>
<p>There's a large space of possibilities nature hasn't sampled and which we
<br>
can, sure. Despite proximal probe nanorobotics making great headway
<br>
recently, engineering biology to bootstrap nanotechnology still remains a
<br>
very hot topic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Chemists do random polymer libraries now, too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was unaware of that.  Must make a pretty gooey mess.
</em><br>
<p>And how. They're even doing sugars now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; They're molecules, not machines, though. Very different from biochemistry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Machines are subset of all the possible sets molecules.  Nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has produced &quot;machines&quot;.  Polymerases, ion channels and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proteosome are some that immediately come to mind.  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are splitting hairs if you consider enzymes to not be machines.
</em><br>
<p>No, you got me wrong. Molecular biology is all about machines. It's just
<br>
polymer chemists (by virtue of one of my hats I'm supposed to be one)
<br>
don't consider polymers as machines, because they can't make them, and,
<br>
worse, unaware that molecules and assemblies thereof can be machines..
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Not your typical computer scientist. They understand bits, but not atoms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was thinking the A-life people.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, these do understand bits allright. But even your typical ALifer
<br>
doesn't understand that atoms are much messier and much more difficult to
<br>
manipulate objects than bits.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that is because there is so much money in it due to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pharmaceutical industry.  As soon as you develop some skill set in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; area you get sucked off into a commercial effort.
</em><br>
<p>I've noticed some of that effect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think Goddard is on the right track with this.  And if Nano@Home
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picks up some steam and feeds into what Goddard et al are doing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the simulations then I think your vision may be realized.  One thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is for sure -- with a multi-teraflop machine coming online nanomachine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations will be doable.  If the simulations say they should work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thats going to up the pressure on the synthesists to actually build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to confirm what the simulations predict.
</em><br>
<p>Crossing all available digits here, and not only binary.
