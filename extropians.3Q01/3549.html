How can I be a Dynamic Optimist with all this information, as I'm quite
<br>
protractedly laid off myself.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does &quot;Hayek's Law&quot; condemn the U.S. to a Japanese-like L-shaped recession?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are we in a recession, and if so, what shape will it have--V, U or L? It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be six months, or maybe a lot longer, before we know the answers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those two questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The official government story is the economy is still expanding. But don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put too much faith in that. &quot;When the Bureau of Economic Analysis first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimated real gross domestic product growth for the third quarter of
</em><br>
1990,
<br>
<em>&gt; it reported a positive number of almost 2%,&quot; says Randell E. Moore, editor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Kansas City, Mo.-based Blue Chip Economic Indicators Survey. &quot;It wasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until after the first of the following year that the 1990 third quarter
</em><br>
was
<br>
<em>&gt; revised to a negative number.&quot; So you can't be reassured by the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the average forecast of the 50 economists Moore tracks is a slow but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive 1.8% real growth in 2001. &quot;The consensus typically doesn't
</em><br>
forecast
<br>
<em>&gt; recessions,&quot; warns Moore.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Houses are still being built and cars are selling well. But whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industries, including capital goods, advertising and telecom, are in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own recession. Layoffs in June totaled 125,000; company after company
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reports billion-dollar losses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So let's look on the dark side. If we're about to enter a real recession,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will it be a V-shaped recession like in 1980? That would mean a quick
</em><br>
break
<br>
<em>&gt; followed by rapid rebound. Or will it be a U-shaped recession like in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1981-82, in which the economy stalls and takes a painfully long time to
</em><br>
get
<br>
<em>&gt; going again? Or will it be an L-shaped one--a crash followed by a
</em><br>
protracted
<br>
<em>&gt; period of slow-to-no growth? Example: Japan in the 1990s, after the
</em><br>
1984-89
<br>
<em>&gt; bubble.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jay N. Mueller, economist at Menomonee Falls, Wis.-based Strong Capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Management, is an optimist (he still projects 1.5%-to-2.5% growth in 2001)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who nevertheless worries about several potential causes of L-shaped
</em><br>
trouble:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; . The low personal savings rate, which sank to -1.3% in early 2001.
</em><br>
Capital
<br>
<em>&gt; gains financed spending. But now many investors have capital losses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; . The high tax burden. The combined federal, state and local take was
</em><br>
32.6%
<br>
<em>&gt; of GDP in 2000, significantly above the World War II high of 30.8%.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; . The high debt burden. Business debt is 64.4% of GDP, up from 53.4% in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1994; interest on mortgage and consumer debt now consumes a near-record
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 14.3% of disposable income.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; . Excessive business investment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This may seem an odd concern. But excessive or misallocated investment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (&quot;malinvestment&quot;) is at the heart of a business-cycle theory that, at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time of the Great Depression, was a serious competitor with Keynesianism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Named after the birthplace of its two major proponents, Ludwig von Mises
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; F.A. Hayek, &quot;Austrian Economics&quot; has attracted new attention with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discrediting of Keynesianism--and with the unusual characteristics of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postboom economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The world economies have struggled this year in accordance with Hayek's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Law,&quot; says Mark Skousen, an occasional FORBES contributor and editor of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; Austrian-oriented financial newsletter Forecasts &amp; Strategies. &quot;Hayek's
</em><br>
Law
<br>
<em>&gt; states that the economy takes a long time to recover after an
</em><br>
unsustainable
<br>
<em>&gt; boom (1995-99). The excesses of the previous boom create an investment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure that cannot be easily dismantled and transferred to new uses.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's news to modern Austrian economists that Hayek had a law. But they do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see a point to Skousen's coinage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The expansion of the late 1990s and subsequent downturn are better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explained by Hayek's theory than by any other business-cycle theory,&quot; says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Roger W. Garrison, economics professor at Auburn University and an adjunct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scholar at the independent Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Ala. &quot;The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificiality of the boom probably dates to early 1996, when the Federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reserve lowered interest rates even though the unemployment rate was at or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; near its 'natural,' or 'full-employment' level. The misallocations of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; late 1990s entailed overinvestments in future-oriented and highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speculative projects--dot-coms and the like.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Garrison also notes that the economy, ominously, seems no longer to be all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that responsive to Federal Reserve stimulation. &quot;All these features are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent with Hayek's theory,&quot; he says.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another Mises Institute adjunct, Frank E. Shostak, chief economist for MAN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Financial Australia in Sydney, Australia, argues that the severity of U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distortion shows in the record-high ratio of capital-goods investment to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal consumption (see chart, below). He predicts &quot;a severe liquidation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of capital goods production.&quot; Maybe you should short
</em><br>
semiconductor-equipment
<br>
<em>&gt; manufacturers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Depressing? Two more, even nastier, worries from the dark side:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; . The strong U.S. dollar. Continued strength may choke manufactured
</em><br>
exports.
<br>
<em>&gt; A break, on the other hand, may choke off foreign capital imports, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently finance American government and industry to an unprecedented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; . International weakness. Not only is there recession in some key markets,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like Mexico, but there are also potential crises, as in Argentina and
</em><br>
Japan.
<br>
<em>&gt; AIG International economist Bernard Connolly has told clients: &quot;The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions seem to be falling into place for a global growth panic over
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; next couple of months.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Austrian economists still have a healthy respect for the power of monetary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy. Skousen even says he expects some short-term recovery because of
</em><br>
Fed
<br>
<em>&gt; interest rate cuts. But it will be &quot;an artificial recovery that cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sustained.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So: V, U or L? Distinguished Chicago school economist Milton Friedman, now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at Stanford's Hoover Institution, thinks it will be a sort of V: &quot;We are
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; a mild recession, and there is a good chance that we will bottom around
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; end of this year and go into a relatively mild expansion.&quot; Under the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances, that's a somewhat bullish thought.
</em><br>
