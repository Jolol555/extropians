<em>&gt; This assumes a worse case scenario that other societies change slower

</em><br>
<p>Agreed, *but*...we also find no lack of inertia, beauracracy, and
<br>
excessive secrecy strongly throttling back the potential use of
<br>
research once completed (to the point where it must be done over and
<br>
over again, at much wasted cost), that basically negate the advantages
<br>
the military sector of a society may have.  I submit the modern
<br>
American military as a prime example (since that's the one I'm most
<br>
familiar with).  If we can get the same advantages without these
<br>
disadvantages...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; How do we know whom to attack in retaliation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Actually, refusing to retaliate will probably work wonders as far as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; convincing most of the world not to attack (or keep attacking) us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You will set yourself open to attack, because unless you demonstrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your superiority, they will assume that your reluctance means you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have weaknesses you do not want them to know. Merely not retaliating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will simply encourage more attempts, unless you demostrate your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relative superority (such as by defeating the enemy without taking a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single life).
</em><br>
<p>Ah...you underestimate the value of diplomacy and PR:
<br>
<p>* Earth nation attacks
<br>
* We fight the attack off
<br>
* Instead of counterattacking with our own military, we broadcast to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the nation's press agencies, &quot;Call your dogs off!  We're the good
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;guys here!&quot;
<br>
* Eventually, popular support for any such offensive will wane in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;face of this.  Only the most dictatorial countries can continue to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;attack for long under these circumstances...and with their efforts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;focussed on us, their neighbors may well be tempted to invade,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;especially if they've been seeing the same broadcasts from us and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;thus have popular support to stop the war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You seem to have slightly misunderstood my point here.  In any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society, there will be some societal conditioning (norms, commonly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; held beliefs that sometimes get coded into law, et cetera).  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; saying, shape those beliefs so that no one would want to go back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think no rational person would want to leave this colony and return
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to crazy Earth. However, we should always prepare for the unexpected.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed...and in such a situation, we should strive to make sure that no
<br>
rational person would indeed want to leave.  If it ever gets to the
<br>
point where rational people start leaving, especially in significant
<br>
quantities, that's a very visible symptom of a problem that probably
<br>
needs to be fixed ASAP.  (And directly halting emigration won't help:
<br>
see East Germany during the Warsaw Pact years.  If rational people want
<br>
to leave badly enough, they'll find ways.)
