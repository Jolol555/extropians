<em>&gt; deal to Ruger or Kahr or Smith and Wesson, perhaps, but a mighty big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insult to the Constitution...and to the Founders, some of whom were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gun makers.)
</em><br>
<p>This is incorrect. According to the BATF's own interpretations of the
<br>
NFA of 1934 and the GCA of 1968, construction of a non class II or III
<br>
weapon (i.e. anything other than a fully automatic weapon or silencer,
<br>
etc) it is fully legal for a private individual to construct for their
<br>
own private use, they do not need a manufacturers license and they do
<br>
not have to put serial numbers on their firearms.
<br>
The recent case of the Maadi-Griffin is about Stewart making the kits
<br>
for sale to others putting too much work into the parts, which made the
<br>
customers mere assemblers of previously manufactured parts. The man
<br>
making the kits thus violated the above described interpretation. The
<br>
rights violating thing is that the BATF will not issue a ruling on how
<br>
much work the private user must put into the firearm for it to be
<br>
considered manufactured by them, thus failing to set a standard unfairly
<br>
deters otherwise law abiding people from even venturing into this area
<br>
of home hobbying. In this case, the BATF is acting extra-legally to
<br>
regulate something they have no authority over.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tangential to this issue, but intersecting it, is the issue of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; licensing in general. More and more employment requires that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state issue a permission slip. As with the cloning arguments seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, the debate is usually couched in terms of &quot;public safety.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Though how the licensing of fortune tellers, here in Santa Cruz, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a matter of public safety is quite mysterious.) The real issue, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; readers of my stuff will know, is the creation and support of guilds:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; licensing is a rent-seeking mechanism.
</em><br>
<p>This licensing does fit into a libertarian scheme as well, where one
<br>
would obtain the lowest insurance premiums on one's liability insurance
<br>
if one's skill is certified by some credible third party.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; To cut to the chase, we are seeing a transition to a world of:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- licensed and approved members of professions. Lawyers, doctors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accountants, geologists, tax preparers, fortune tellers, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineers and programmers (in more and more states). At this rate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uncle Sam will have to give his blessing for any activity other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purely amateur or leisure activity. This is NOT what the Constitution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is about. (And please don't anybody cite the &quot;commerce clause&quot;: the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1964 landmark case arguing that interstate commerce was affected by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rib joint not serving blacks--hence making their discrimination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policies subject to Congressional rule--was pretty bogus even back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then. Arguing that a programmer needs to be licensed, regulated, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlled because he might sell a program across state lines is even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more bogus. People often lose sight of the forest for the trees.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Now, the Constitution DOES, in fact, authorize congress to regulate
<br>
interstate commerce, while each state has its tenth amendment authority
<br>
to regulate intrastate commerce to whatever degree its citizens deem
<br>
appropriate. US v. Lopez is a far more recent case than the writer cites
<br>
above, but even that still declares that regulating behavior with direct
<br>
impact on commerce is completely constitutional. I suggest the writer
<br>
look to that decision, as the most recent significant commerce clause
<br>
decision, for further guidance.
<br>
<p>With the internet, it is guarranteed that anyone with a website
<br>
promoting their skill as a programmer is, in fact, engaging in
<br>
interstate commerce. Whether you actually have customers in other states
<br>
is immaterial, you are literally advertising your services across state
<br>
lines, which is, in fact, regulatable under the commerce clause the
<br>
first time someone from another state browses your website, or when your
<br>
website is indexed by a search engine spider.
<br>
<p>However, there is a significant difference between regulating and
<br>
banning. One is not the other. Banning one form of interstate commerce
<br>
is not regulating it, since with the act of banning, no such commerce
<br>
does occur. The proper 'original intent' means of instituting an
<br>
effective ban is to impose a prohibitive tax upon undesired activity.
<br>
This was properly applied with the National Firearms Act of 1934, which
<br>
did not ban machine guns or silencers, it merely imposed a $200.00
<br>
federal tax on the sale and transfer of such devices. Since silencers at
<br>
the time retailed in hardware stores for about $5.00, this was a
<br>
significantly prohibitive tax of 4000%. At the same time, machine guns
<br>
were selling for $25-125.00 in the same corner hardware stores, so a
<br>
$200.00 tax on the purchase of one was also a significant deterrent
<br>
against their purchase.
<br>
<p>Thus a proper 'regulatory' response to the desire to control the
<br>
proliferation of technology would be to tax it at a level commensurate
<br>
with the estimated costs of allowing such technology to get into the
<br>
hands of bad people. This is the only sort of response which could
<br>
withstand a court challenge, with the only possible defense being one
<br>
which utilizes the principle that exercising one's rights cannot be
<br>
taxed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -- to a world where broad areas of research are banned or restricted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to controlled institutions. Seen with CBW research, and now cloning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How long before it carries over to other areas in biology? Why not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restrict computer virus research? Or nanotech research?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Some of these areas are even &quot;dangerous.&quot; Imagine Ben Franklin being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrested for &quot;conducting banned research into electricity&quot;? &quot;We are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ordering a timeout on Dr. Franklin's dangerous experiments with kites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and keys. We have it on good authority from our own experts that Dr.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Franklin might hurt himself. And, as we know, lightning causes fires.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Man was not meant to know such things...unless we in government are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing the work. Dr. Franklin should consider this a warning shot.&quot; As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an exercise, make up a list of all of the other kinds of research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which might have been banned on the grounds that it might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous to the researcher or, someday, to others. &quot;But these flying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contraptions will no doubt crash and kill many innocent people. All
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are requiring is a &quot;timeout&quot; on this forbidden research by these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wright brothers.&quot;)
</em><br>
<p>Very salient examples indeed. As in my own example above, restrictions
<br>
must be properly based upon an excise framework to withstand repeated
<br>
court challenges, and even then, excessive taxes upon the use of such
<br>
technology can be challenged under the 'cruel and unusual punishment'
<br>
clause. If its wrong to punish convicts cruelly and unusually, doing so
<br>
to law abiding citizens should be doubly so, so any tax regieme would
<br>
have to prove the validity of its own numbers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- the &quot;ban on bomb-making instructions&quot; proposed by the usual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspects is a variant on this issue. If such a ban is passed into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law, and upheld, how long before it carries over to requiring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encyclopedia editors excise articles on bombs, ANFO, and Astrolite?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How long before court transcripts are censored to remove forbidden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge? 
</em><br>
<p>Such information is now restricted in the US from being displayed on the
<br>
internet, which is unenforcable given the internet's international
<br>
scope.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The next point shows where this takes us:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- and as with &quot;precursor chemicals,&quot; chemicals which _could_ be made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into methamphetamines or Sarin or other banned items, there will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bans on &quot;precursor knowledge.&quot; This is probably exactly what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening now with the Rael group and their early work on human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cloning. Odds are excellent that they are at least several years away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from actually attempting a human cloning. It's the groundwork, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precursor knowledge, that the government is now cracking down on. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very disturbing trend.
</em><br>
<p>THe problem is that real examples like Aum Shinrikyo are of sufficient
<br>
magnitude that they trigger the 'police or chaos' response that
<br>
revolutionary terrorism is intended to accomplish, and government seems
<br>
to have no problems with playing the game to gain more power. The fact
<br>
that Rael group is obviously a bunch of wackos is specifically intended
<br>
to trigger a similar response in people, and I would not be at all
<br>
surprised to find out that the Rael group is playing the 'agent
<br>
provovateur' game in this regard, just as they played the government's
<br>
game in promulgating the ufo garbage to help the gov't cover up its top
<br>
secret aircraft work by labeling witnesses as flying saucer loonies.
