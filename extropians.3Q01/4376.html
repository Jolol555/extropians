<em>&gt; &gt; I don't think DNA can be copyrighted, so this particular way to prevent

<em>&gt; &gt; that US courts have ruled against turning someone into a parent without

<em>&gt; &gt; his or her consent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Correction, US courts have ruled against turning someone into a parent without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her consent, but in the case of his consent, US courts have not ruled against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, and men have indeed been turned into parents without their consent.
</em><br>
<p>And the courts actually support it. Women have the right to consent to
<br>
be parents at any time, men don't have any right to consent. So much for
<br>
'equal protection under the law'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so copyright protection isn't really necessary. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this wouldn't prevent large-scale cloning of celebrities, since you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can create one illegal clone, get his consent, and then all subsequent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; clones will be legal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not according to US law, where otherwise lawful acts, dependent upon unlawful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acts, thereby become unlawful.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but the reverse also applies in the parental consent ring. For
<br>
example, a teenage boy was asked by an adult woman to father her child,
<br>
with an agreement that she'd never ask for any support or anything from
<br>
him. She later abrogated this agreement on the grounds that with him
<br>
being a minor, the contract could not be consented to by him, yet when
<br>
he counterclaimed statutory rape as a means of escaping responsibility
<br>
for the child, the courts found in favor of the mother.
<br>
<p>In a similar case, a fellow was passed out, drunk, in a bed, when a
<br>
woman came in an had sex with him while he was asleep, later fathering
<br>
his child from that one sexual act. Her rape of him therafter made him
<br>
financially responsible for the child, according to the opinion of the
<br>
court.
<br>
<p>If abortion is permitted to women in cases of rape, should not men be
<br>
afforded an equal means of eliminating the responsibility that was
<br>
forced on them?
<br>
<p>If women are permitted to steal a man's DNA without consent, and later
<br>
force them to pay child support, I would not be surprised at all that a
<br>
similar crime could be perpetrated by cloning. Keep your hairbrushes in
<br>
a safe, fellows. Incinerate your condoms, underwear, socks, etc.
<br>
<p>This sort of absurd legal conundrum is tantamount to a thief breaking
<br>
their leg while breaking into your house, and suing you for medical
<br>
expenses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (It does cause an 18-year delay though, or however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; many years until the illegal clone reaches age of consent.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By that time the evolutionary phase transition will have rendered organic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carbon units obsolete, and biology will have transcended organic chemistry. As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a consequence, cloning will have become a moot issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I wonder if we might see anti-cloning technology that actually would work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such technology already exists. It's called abortion.
</em><br>
<p>Well, a proper court precedent to discourage this would be to give the
<br>
DNA owner full custody while giving the cloner full financial
<br>
responsibility with no visitation rights.
