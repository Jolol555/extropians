The insurance industry isn't very complicated - you can insure anything
<br>
with virtually any pay-off restrictions provided you find an underwriter.
<br>
So, the answer to your question in theory is &quot;yes&quot; and in practice is
<br>
&quot;find an underwriter&quot;.  I'm sure Lloyds of London would do it, they'll
<br>
do almost anything :-)  I'm sure an insurer would be happy, if you gave
<br>
them stats on your odds of being frozen, to adjust a standard life 
<br>
insurance policy to have reduced payments for the reduced chance of
<br>
payoff.  You'd just need to find a flexible underwriter...

<p>Natasha's post gave me a wacky idea.  What if an insurance policy
<br>
could be set up that would pay only if we get cryosuspended?
<br>
<p>Reason:  many of us here have no descendants and being objectivist
<br>
and largely atheist, have no interest in what becomes of our earthy
<br>
remains or our estates should we not be preserved for whatever
<br>
reason.  (I can imagine a disturbingly large number of ways that
<br>
even an Alcor bracelet-wearer could expire without getting
<br>
preserved: perishing in a terrorist attack, disappearing without
<br>
a trace, crime victim, determined suicide, etc.)
<br>
<p>Have we any insurance experts?  Would such a policy be
<br>
set-upable?  Would it be much cheaper than a standard
<br>
policy?  Half?  Two thirds?  Have we numbers available
<br>
on persons who were signed up for cryosuspension who
<br>
did not get preserved upon their demise?  spike
