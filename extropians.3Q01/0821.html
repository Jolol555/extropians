<p><p>Of course, and good health (with accompanying good looks) helps people to live

longer, which in turn allows them to have lots of friends. Circular analysis?
<br>
Maybe. But there's a lot of interaction and feedback between cause and effect
<br>
involved as well.
<br>
<p>Trying to use a particular aspect of the rich interplay of human social
<br>
organization (to the exclusion of other aspects) to prove validity of personal
<br>
belief, indicates the bias connected with such belief.
<br>
<p>There's not just a placebo effect implied in the health benefits of
<br>
church-going. It may also involve a panacea effect, as believers attempt to
<br>
apply religiosity to solve all problems.

<p>Stay hungry,

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
