<p>Thank you, that's nice of you to say.  Sorry about the crummy formatting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The idea that light could traverse millions of lightyears without losing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy always seemed to me a dubious one. Because light can't lose energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in its intensity like sound does, it would need to lose it in its
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonderful post.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I guess light could be redshifted for several reasons...Doppler shift
<br>
recessional velocity, climbing out of gravity wells...and then there's the
<br>
absorption and remission of light as it travels through atmospheres or space.
<br>
<p>A redshift from the interaction of photons with atoms in the galactic and
<br>
intergalactic media has been denied because the resulting angular dispersion
<br>
would cause their images to become blurred, and our images of other galaxies
<br>
are, indeed, not blurred.
<br>
<p>Physicists understand that when a beam of light passes through the atmosphere, a
<br>
fraction of the photons interacts with the medium and loses energy to it,
<br>
undergoing angular dispersion. This is known as Rayleigh scattering after
<br>
British physicist John Rayleigh. I guess most physicists assume that the rest of
<br>
the light, which suffers no dispersion, passes through the medium without
<br>
interaction. Given the density of the atoms and molecules of the atmosphere,
<br>
however, this seems improbable.
<br>
<p>At a distance of 100 meters, for example, it is everyday experience that light
<br>
is transmitted through calm air without any noticeable angular dispersion and
<br>
does not produce any visible fuzziness - even when images are observed through a
<br>
telescope. The index of refraction of air (n=1.0003) shows that interactions or
<br>
collisions of photons on air molecules are such that the
<br>
photons are delayed by 3 centimeter in a trajectory of 100 meters, with respect
<br>
to transmission in a vacuum. It would seem that  a large number of
<br>
photon-molecule collisions would be needed to explain that delay of 3 cm.
<br>
<p>A sensible inference from this evidence is that most interactions involve an
<br>
atom or molecule absorbing a photon and reemitting it in the forward direction,
<br>
and that these interactions are inelastic; that is, the reemitted photons have
<br>
lost some of the original energy to the atom or molecule, and hence their
<br>
wavelengths are longer.
<br>
<p>In space, where the gas density is lower by orders of magnitude, the same
<br>
phenomenon takes place. A photon undergoes some  interaction due to the index of
<br>
refraction, with no angular dispersion, as it is absorbed and reemitted
<br>
traveling through space. Rayleigh scattering producing diffusion in all
<br>
directions, is enormously less frequent just as in the atmosphere. Hence, almost
<br>
all interactions of photons with gas molecules should take place without any
<br>
measurable angular dispersion.
<br>
<p>Experimental confirmation of this theory of the redshift has been claimed in
<br>
several instances. For example, in the case of the Sun, where the theory has
<br>
been applied to the redshift anomaly associated with the solar chromosphere.
<br>
When spectroscopic measurements are made of light from the center of the Sun's
<br>
disk and compared with those from the limb (edge of the disk), the latter are
<br>
found to be redshifted with respect to the former - Above and beyond the Doppler
<br>
shift that arise from the Sun's rotation. This anomaly was first reported in
<br>
1907.
<br>
<p>Attempts have been made to explain this redshift as a Doppler effect on the
<br>
basis of the motion of masses of gas in the photosphere and chromosphere, or
<br>
such motions in the solar granules (convection cells).
<br>
<p>If, however, the redshift arises from the increasing number of photon-atom
<br>
interactions between source and observer as the spectroscope samples positions
<br>
nearer the limb, the theory mentioned here applies, and provides an accurate
<br>
prediction of the observed curve [see graph at
<br>
<a href="http://www.newtonphysics.on.ca/BIGBANG/Bigbang.html">http://www.newtonphysics.on.ca/BIGBANG/Bigbang.html</a>]. The theory is also
<br>
successful in explaining the absence of redshifting for several spectral lines
<br>
in terms of their known origin in very high layers of the Sun, and in explaining
<br>
a stronger redshift for the iron line at 5,250 angstroms in terms of its known
<br>
origin in a deeper layer.
<br>
<p>Is there enough matter in space to account for the observed redshift in terms of
<br>
the theory offered here?  Perhaps not, but our
<br>
ability to detect such matter is still very imperfect. Almost all of our methods
<br>
of detection are  selective and can detect only one kind of matter. Most methods
<br>
use spectroscopy to detect  radiation emitted or absorbed by the matter. There
<br>
are strong reasons for thinking that there is much more matter in space than has
<br>
been observed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The universe is shaping up to be a real beauty for transhumans: a truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite playground!
</em><br>
<p>Yea baby!
