<p>Ja but I made the mistake of assuming anything that is natural
<br>
is not pollution.  But when you think it over, *most* pollution
<br>
is natural.  Plankton blooms have been with us since always,
<br>
(granted they are made worse when fertilizer is dumped into the
<br>
sea), dust storms far preceded the use of the plow, volcanoes
<br>
spewed ash, and if one is allergic to pollen, flowering plants are
<br>
the worst polluters ever to evolve.
<br>
<p>The environmentalists gave Reagan no end to headaches for
<br>
saying that Redwood trees pollute the air, but he may not
<br>
have been too far off the mark, especially if one considers
<br>
all the hydrocarbons they emit.  Redwoods have natural
<br>
pesticides, so these trees dump uncontrolled quantities of
<br>
pesticides into the environment.  You can smell them, can
<br>
you not?
<br>
<p>With sufficiently advanced technology, I can envision a world
<br>
truly free of pollution.  Natural pollution would be controlled
<br>
or eliminated.  spike
