<p>I usually object, gently and politely, to people when they try to send me 
<br>
Word documents, pointing out that it is a great carrier of macro viruses, 
<br>
creates extremely inefficient oversized documents, and is generally not 
<br>
backward compatible with itself (not everybody has the funds to run out and 
<br>
buy a new copy of Word in order to be able to read documents created by the 
<br>
latest version). I just ask them to save the document as flat text, or RTF 
<br>
format, or html. My preferred format is html. Html is readable on 
<br>
anything... even my little Palm!

<p>Hey, this is a really interesting thing I like to point out to people they 
<br>
say that Microsoft, love it or hate it, is here for good. I reply that it 
<br>
ain't necessarily so, and ask them &quot;What about CP/M?&quot; I then await their 
<br>
puzzled look so that I can explain to them that it was only recently that 
<br>
CP/M was ubiquitous -- everybody thought that operating system was here to 
<br>
stay. But now just 15(?) or 20(?) years later hardly anybody has even heard 
<br>
of it. Microsoft are not in it for the long haul -- too much bad karma.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
