<em>&gt; Well, they obviously have human interests (those of their stockholders)
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>They don't even have the interests of their stockholders at heart; 
<br>
what they have is a set of rules that are *assumed* to benefit the
<br>
stockholders and which they are required to follow. 
<br>
<p>For example, corporations are required to file accounts on a quarterly
<br>
or annual basis. Their performance is then evaluated entirely in 
<br>
terms of profitability on those time scales. It is possible for a 
<br>
company to really badly compromise the long-term interests of its
<br>
shareholders (e.g. by pissing in the commons the shareholders live
<br>
in) while remaining consistent with the strict interpretation of their
<br>
rules.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you don't like the interests expressed by a particular company, buy
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>When was the last time you brought out a corporation you didn't get
<br>
on with?
<br>
<p>(And when was the last time you took an arbitrary law as holy writ?)
<br>
<p>Corporations exist to serve the common good. End of story. Of course,
<br>
arbitrarily shutting them down or overruling their self-interest is
<br>
a great way to undermine private enterprise, which is broadly speaking
<br>
a Bad Thing. However,  companies only operate within the framework 
<br>
of the market -- human beings operate in a broader context, and we
<br>
need a way to deliver signals to companies when their actions have
<br>
serious adverse consequences outside the market.
<br>
<p>Saying that the only way to deal with a company that (for instance)
<br>
emits lethal pollution or bribes politicians to pass laws that encroach
<br>
on the commons is to buy out the shareholders strikes me as the height
<br>
of irresponsibility. And don't tell me that corporate manslaughter
<br>
laws work -- if they did, the entire board of every tobacco company
<br>
would be serving a life stretch right now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Was the WSPQ (World's Shortest Political Quiz) this loaded, and I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To my (non-American) eyes the answer is &quot;yes, it was&quot;.  Be scared!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why didn't you point out that it was loaded at the time?  No one
</em><br>

<em>&gt; The definition of a liberal is one who is so fair minded that he/she
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Communist/Green/Black Panther/Feminazi Party.
</em><br>
<p>Naah. It reflects the British mainstream, more or less accurately. I
<br>
figure it's biased a little to the left on the economic/social issues,
<br>
and a little to the libertarian on the control/anarchism axis -- although
<br>
this might be my own bias showing.
