<em>&gt;Exactly. A very recent news article showed that drug companies

<p>I don't want to defend the drug companies here, but this does not mean that
<br>
the advertizing is not socially useful.  For example, it lets people know
<br>
about the products.  Also, some of the so called ad money went, according to
<br>
drug company spokespeople to giving out free samples.
<br>
<p>That said, I think the real problem with drug companies is not so much their
<br>
budgets or how they divide, but the fact that they basically have a
<br>
protected market here in the US.  With the FDA and perscription drug laws,
<br>
the costs for entry into that market are prohibitively high.  Are you
<br>
willing to go along with getting rid of these regulations, which only seem
<br>
to slow down innovation and drive up costs?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There must always be a first step. The main problem is that business
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has planted in the brains of us Americans that the economic indicators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that indicate good opportunity for business, must also necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mean that things are good for Americans.
</em><br>
<p>Suggest some measures.  I don't think standard of living is the only measure
<br>
people go by these days.  To be antibusiness or anticapitalist is not
<br>
something new.  It's been around for a long, long time and has never really
<br>
gone out of fashion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Slaves are good for businesses. They work rather cheaply. But not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so good for the slaves...
</em><br>
<p>If that's so, how come slavery isn't practiced more widely today?
<br>
<p>Why was the South poor and the North rich before the Civil War?
<br>
<p>Why don't we see a lot of business going on in the Sudan, where slavery is
<br>
still practiced?  It should be an economic powerhouse by that line of
<br>
thinking.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
