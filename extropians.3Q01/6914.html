some

willing
<br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can be willing to sacrifice your OWN life.  You don't get to decide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether to sacrifice SOMEONE ELSE'S life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are known exceptions to this rule.  I talked about one of them when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I said that I would, in theory, back a ground war in Afghanistan and Iraq
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to remove their governments from power.
</em><br>
A deontologist about sacrificing others would say that it is morally
<br>
obligatory never to sacrifice someone else's life, a consequentialists
<br>
weighs the possible good that might result from sacrificing others. On this
<br>
issue you are consequentialist it seems. Deontologists would disagree that
<br>
there are exceptions, and thus that they are well known.
<br>
<p><p>(In an
<br>
<em>&gt; entangled world it is possible for moral principles to directly conflict,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so we cannot be morally comfortable this side of the Singularity, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's important to remember that all such conflicts are still bugs in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Universe, and must be minimized rather than embraced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It is hard to imagine anyone disagreeing with you here. We might add another
<br>
seeming truism that neither can the moral bugs in the universe be evaded.
<br>
There is obviously no truly ethical solution to our current crises, only a
<br>
choice among sad alternatives. But of course true morality will remain a
<br>
mere  ideal until humans participate in superintelligence, or
<br>
superintelligence participates in the human.
