<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; That example doesn't seem to work!  I can just imagine you going

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; across a large river, drinking the water, using it to water your
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Chief!  This stuff isn't H20!&quot;.  You'd then probably conclude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that not all water in the universe has the same chemical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; composition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I dont follow this, what do you mean the officer runs over and says its not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; H2O? If its a compound similar to water and acts in the same way, it still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is what it is. What else could it be? If its compound X, then its molecular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; structure might be different. My use of it doesnt change its identity or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; water's.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I don't understand is why there persists this notion that physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws and even the elements will be discretely different on other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planets. This isn't a new notion to my knowledge, its been around at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least since H Beam Piper wrote his story &quot;Syllabary&quot; (where humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploring a martian civilization figure out how to translate martian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the remains of a martian table of the elements, and the reporter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with them asks them why martians don't have different elements...) but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have thought that people would have gotten over such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ludicrousness.
</em><br>
<p>That's why I said &quot;very different galaxy&quot; to try to maximize the
<br>
alienness that *might* be encountered.  We don't know that all
<br>
elements were cooked in equal proportions through out the 
<br>
universe, and, though I agree that the chance is pretty slim,
<br>
it's not impossible that we would find *somewhere* in the universe
<br>
a substance that also had the usual characteristics of H2O we
<br>
find in daily life.
