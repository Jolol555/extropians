Agreed.

<p><em>&gt; But what is infinitely more scary is a second possiblity:  that

</em><br>

<br>
Naah. This quiz doesn't actually imply that the people who set it
<br>
support these positions; it's designed to establish whether you,
<br>
the person who's sitting the quiz, supports those positions. To that
<br>
extent, it's a success. What would be most scary would be if, say,
<br>
it characterised you as a left-wing authoritarian, for example --
<br>
a position that's radically far away from one you'd self-identify
<br>
with, if I'm not mistaken.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In other words, what is really scary is when even slight injustices
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Eh?
<br>
<p>I don't follow you. You seem to be confusing the political compass
<br>
quiz (which is aimed at people who come from a culture that is not
<br>
your own, where political discourse is framed in different terms --
<br>
for example the &quot;nigger&quot; word is merely considered rude, and what
<br>
you call a &quot;liberal&quot; would probably be at home in the conservative
<br>
party) with an expression of the ideologies it's polling.
