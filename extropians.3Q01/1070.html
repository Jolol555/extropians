</em><br>
<p>If the theory was true, &quot;something strange&quot; would have already been
<br>
recorded by mall surveillance cameras, or sheer coincidence would have
<br>
generated some kind of psychic phenomenon during a press conference.  Or
<br>
is there a reason why the flaws in the Matrix only appear to groups of a
<br>
few believers and only when the video cameras are turned off?
<br>
<p>Using my psi-is-bunk hypothesis, I predict that transparency will fail to
<br>
capture any psychic phenomena, that the advocates will go on believing
<br>
anyway, and that what they cite as evidence will shift even further into
<br>
the realm of alleged past victories and present reports of unverifiable
<br>
subjective experiences.
<br>
<p>As communications technology advances, the impressiveness of reported
<br>
psychic phenomena decreases in strict lockstep.  Where past psychics could
<br>
apparently perform huge miracles on demand in front of crowds of
<br>
thousands, present-day psychics are apparently limited to small unreliable
<br>
phenomena performed for tiny groups of believers when the video cameras
<br>
are turned off.
<br>
<p>I'll formalize the statement:  &quot;If alleged reports of a phenomenon grow
<br>
steadily less impressive with proximity to the present day and the advance
<br>
of communications and recording technology, then the phenomenon is not
<br>
real, the reports are the product of strictly memetic forces.&quot;  That
<br>
behavior is uniquely predicted by the memetic hypothesis.
