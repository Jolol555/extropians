<em>&gt; My usage of the term needs criticism:  &quot;A racist is someone who is

<em>&gt; automatically antagonistic towards someone else just because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that person's race.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I think this matches my definition.  It depends on how extensive
<br>
&quot;antagonistic&quot; needs to be.  Crossing to the other side of the street to
<br>
avoid one race and not another would seem slightly antagonistic or rude.  I
<br>
would classify this as slightly racist.  It is too bad that a decision is
<br>
made on race, but a stranger in a strange neighborhood probably shouldn't
<br>
try to be nice and polite to strangers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Is there any good reason to split hairs with these terms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to practice prejudice and discrimination while claiming not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be racist?
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Harvey, please give some of the people here more credit than that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like you, many really do want to come to the truth about a very
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  I retract any implication that people here are trying to do this.
<br>
It is my own limited thinking that prevents me from seeing a good reason to
<br>
do this.  In my mind racism is the belief, prejudice is an assumption made
<br>
on that belief, and discrimination is an action based on that assumption.  I
<br>
don't see any value in trying to define scenarios where actions can be
<br>
defined to take place without assumptions, or where assumptions can be
<br>
defined to take place without beliefs.
