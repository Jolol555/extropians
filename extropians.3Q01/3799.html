<p><em>&gt; [Lee Corbin wrote]

<em>&gt;&gt; My usage of the term needs criticism:  &quot;A racist is someone who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; automatically antagonistic towards someone else just because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that person's race.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You asked for it ;) I think it could be argued that someone could in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that a particular race is inherently superior without taking any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action based on that.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't mean to imply that action had to be taken.  Thanks for the
<br>
correction.  It should now read
<br>
<p>&quot;A racist is someone who automatically feels antagonistic towards
<br>
someone else just because of that person's race.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think its the philosophy itself that is the problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actions are predated by thoughts, thoughts are framed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within a philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so.  The philosophy comes last in people,
<br>
if ever.  The philosophy is constructed and rationalized
<br>
after the thoughts.  As for thoughts, sometimes they precede
<br>
action, and sometimes are preceded by action.
