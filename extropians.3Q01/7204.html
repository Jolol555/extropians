<p>I used to jump all the time and can see some problems with chutes.
<br>
Parachutes are very expensive first of all (2500 to over 5K dollars each),
<br>
also it takes a good deal of training to learn to use one correctly. Also,
<br>
in the city with a lot of big buildings, I dont even want to think about the
<br>
wind shear around those buildings.
<br>
<p>Rope is MUCH safer, even if they were just tied on and lowered down by
<br>
others. Maybe some type of winch should be on each floor that could be used.
<br>
Also, with the adrenal levels where they was when the buildings were on
<br>
fire, I can assure you, those people could have climbed a 100 story rope
<br>
before they would have wanted to jump. You may have had a problem with the
<br>
seriously overwieght people holding their own weight up, but theres a limit
<br>
to the extent that anyone can go to try to make something safe. Designing an
<br>
escape route for someone that weighed 800lbs may not be cost effective. All
<br>
I can say is that the seriously heavy people should take that into
<br>
consideration when choosing their lifestyle.
