For the benefit of &quot;Randy Smith,&quot; who evidently did not read the article, here it is again.
<br>
Exodus from Africa
<br>
Thousands of Africans have abandoned their homes in search of a better life in Europe. The journey is long and dangerous and may not be successful. African journalist Sorious Samura fled the violence in his country, Sierra Leone, for London. He later returned to document the violence there in an award-winning documentary, &quot;Cry Freetown.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Samura has now turned his focus on the arduous trek that Africans are making and why they risk their lives for an uncertain future. In &quot;Exodus &gt;From Africa,&quot; Samura traces the steps of his fellow Africans leaving their homes and families behind for the promise of Europe.

<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><em>  &gt;From: &quot;J. R. Molloy&quot; &gt; &gt; Little wonder, then, that the European Commission, the executive body 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; &gt; of the 15-nation European Union, has said zero-immigration policies 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; &gt; are out of step with reality and declared: &quot;Our aim is to open as 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; &gt; large a debate as possible on immigration and asylum.&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt; 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; &gt; [Translation: our aim is to .... hit em hard with more blackmail and 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; &gt; propanganda!] 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;Does &quot;blackmail&quot; include reparations schemes? 
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In some respect, yes, I suppose it does.  The problem is that blacks were not really compensated for slavery.  And let me tell you somthing--they resent it, many of them. I have in the past, and still am, in some respects, been in close proximity ot many blacks.  They as a rule do not like white people.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As Burch pointed out, they never got their 40 acres and a mule (in most cases).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But of course this diverges from the point I was making: business lobbies want to have more labor available in America. They want to pay less for labor.  Govt is very much the hand puppet of business. Senior citizens vote, and they are afraid of being without Social security, and so the corporate media threatens them with the loss of that unless immigrants are allowed in and thereby increase the labor supply.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is the essence of a ponzi scheme, but the old folks don't really care; they are easily frightened, and most of the rest of the citizenry are either oblivious, or they want more immigrants b/c they stand to gain (some fairly small fraction actually benefit by my (and others') estimation; or, they are afraid to speak out for fear of being demonized as a bigot. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have a point to make, or what...?
