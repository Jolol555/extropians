</em><br>
<p>After all thats been said, Im with Zero on this.  I *like* my profile,
<br>
and have no reason to hide it.
<br>
<p>Note that I do not urge others to throw away their privacy.  I
<br>
recognize there are some very legitimate reasons for maintaining it.
<br>
<p>Since Im out, Im all the more motivated to fight the new world
<br>
order (whatever that is) and fight those who would take away
<br>
freedom.
<br>
<p>I even put my blood on it: I donated a blood sample to DNA dot com.
<br>
About 3 years ago, I stared running my mouth about  trying to
<br>
gather a group of info-nudists, who would reveal their DNA and
<br>
every health habit.  Then some time later, DNA dot com advertised
<br>
they were collecting samples to try to discover genetic links between
<br>
DNA and various diseases.  For this to work, they need to know your
<br>
health habits, and I told all, I held nothing back.  (Fortunately they
<br>
didnt ask about my Jar Jar Binks doll.)  I realize I am taking a
<br>
chance: the info *could* fall into the hands of the insurance
<br>
company, etc.  Evil could happen.  But I decided the
<br>
potential good outweighs the risks. DNA dot com
<br>
is welcoming volunteers.  spike
