<p>Maybe so. Me, I do the nontheism thing most of the time
<br>
in my own head but I don't proselytize.

<p>Olga, we're just on different spots on the nontheism circle,
<br>
as I see it. I might be able to get under some folk's radar.
<br>
I favor sheaves of strategies, and I'm happy with there being
<br>

<br>
<p>Did you ever see the movie _Dogma_? Did you enjoy it?
<br>
Would you believe that Kevin Smith, the auteur, claims
<br>
to still be a practicing Catholic?
