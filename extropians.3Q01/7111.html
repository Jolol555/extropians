<p>Then why is it that in every country where muslims are only a fraction
<br>
of the population, rather than the overwhelming majority, they are one
<br>
of the largest, if not the largest creators of violence? One such
<br>
exception USED to be the United States, and it can be said that almost
<br>
none of those muslims who perpetrate violence here were born here, or
<br>
are even citizens. But, for example, in my local area, four of the six
<br>
murders that have occured in Hanover in the last 20 years were committed
<br>
by muslims. How can there NOT be stereotypes that result?
<br>
<p>Granted, in many areas, the cause is anti-muslim prejudice. Bosnia is a
<br>
significant example of this. However, the situations in Kosovo and
<br>
Macedonia seem to be as much the result of the infiltration of armed
<br>
muslim guerrillas from out of the country with an intent on creating
<br>
strife. In the Phillipines, Indonesia, the central asian republics (the
<br>
'stans), western china, Chechnya, several european nations and a number
<br>
of african nations, there are significant violent muslim movements that
<br>
seem to regard violence as the first option to right the wrongs they
<br>
perceive themselves to be victims of.
<br>
<p>Nor is muslim society a non-violent society. Women are frequently
<br>
murdered in muslim society for things as small as what they wear, who
<br>
they choose to associate with, or for having premarital sex, and such
<br>
murders as seen not as crimes, but as an accepted form of social
<br>
regulation.
<br>
<p>You will get plenty of people saying that Islam is a religion of peace,
<br>
that it does not condone the killing of innocents. But that term is very
<br>
slippery. Who is 'innocent'? By muslim society, a girl who has
<br>
premarital sex is not innocent. By muslim society, a person who supports
<br>
an infidel who fights to be treated equally is not innocent. In muslim
<br>
society, there are believers, and there are infidels. Infidels are
<br>
second class citizens, and do not have the right to be treated like
<br>
believers, though there is lip service to other 'children of the book'
<br>
(jews and christians). An infidel who insists on asserting their rights
<br>
over those of a believer is automatically wrong.
<br>
<p>By muslim law, infidels are not presumed to be innocent until proven
<br>
guilty, they are guilty until proven innocent.
