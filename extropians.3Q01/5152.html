Russell Blackford could easily start 10 threads with his remarks
<br>
on adultery, disloyalty, brutality, political correctness,
<br>
divisiveness, racism, diversity, separatism, and zenophobia!
<br>
<p>I wish I could buy the time to engage in all ten!  For what it's
<br>
worth, I have mixed feelings only about political correctness
<br>
(say given a healthy positive regime fighting for its life),
<br>
diversity, separatism, and zenophobia.  Diversity is important
<br>
for economic reasons alone (Adam Smith attributed our prosperity
<br>
to division of labor alone), but is IMO harmful when it brings
<br>
about divisiveness, and separatism and zenophobia also have 
<br>
their place IMO in most of the historical situations of the 
<br>
past four hundred years.  Possibly including ours.

<p><em>&gt; Let's go through them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Adultery: well, I've expressed support from time to time for the principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of polyamory, so I obviously have a reservation about this one. However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's no doubt that in many contexts adultery is disloyal and destructive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so I didn't quibble about its inclusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Disloyalty: A characteristic I dislike very strongly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brutality: Likewise, almost as much.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Political correctness: This one is complex, but I generally agree that what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *I* call political correctness (which we could discuss) is a bad thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, political correctness is only a sub-set of left-liberal ideas or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social democratic ones - as you know, I am not opposed to all such ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Divisiveness: Another hard one. Principled dissent, disagreement and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument are good things. But &quot;divisiveness&quot; to me means more than than; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means creating division for its own sake, being disruptive, not being a team
</em><br>
<em>&gt; player. I thought that was what you meant and agreed it was a bad thing (ie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is something I dislike and invite others to).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Racism: Something I strongly dislike.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Diversity: The only one I like without qualification (and it's not the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as &quot;divisiveness&quot; as I understand it).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Separatism: To me this means the idea that indigenous peoples in countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as Australia and the US should form their own countries, separating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the Commonwealth or the union. That's what the word usually means over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here. It might mean something else over there. With that meaning, I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's a lousy idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Xenophobia: I *like* people from other countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, with a reservation about how we should think about adultery, and with my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretations of what these words mean, I thought this was a pretty good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list of things to dislike - with the glaring exception of &quot;diversity&quot;.
