</em><br>
<em>&gt; political and social force throughout that region.  You want to propose some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means of decreasing the West's dependence on fossil fuels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Question: What would you propose?
</em><br>
<p>Lots and lots and lots of nuclear power plants.
<br>
<p>To be specific:
<br>
<p>1)  Streamlined regulatory requirements for the construction of nuclear
<br>
power plants.  That doesn't mean looser safety boundaries; it means less
<br>
paperwork.  Adding an engineer to a project makes it safer; adding a
<br>
bureaucracy does not.  My impression is that most of the extraordinary
<br>
expense and construction time associated with nuclear projects is the
<br>
result of bureaucracy.  Turn it over to the engineers.
<br>
<p>2)  If I'm not an anarchocapitalist, it must mean that I want increased
<br>
funding for nuclear R&amp;D.
<br>
<p>3)  If I'm not an anarchocapitalist, then I must think it's appropriate
<br>
for the government to help fund nuclear projects on the grounds that
<br>
achieving France-like nuclear usage means less dependence on foreign oil
<br>
and greater wartime flexibility for the economy.  The real Eliezer
<br>
Yudkowsky predicts that these subsidies will backfire, be spent in the
<br>
wrong place, and probably interfere with the real plants.
<br>
<p>A secondary point would be orbital solar power satellites, and associated
<br>
cheaper launches to get those satellites into space.
<br>
<p>I'd say something about telecommuting, except that my libertarian self
<br>
doesn't see what government has to do with that, and my Extropian self
<br>
thinks that using less power isn't the answer here.
<br>
<p>That's my answer, anyway.  If you need *the* answer, I'd ask Jerry
<br>
Pournelle.
