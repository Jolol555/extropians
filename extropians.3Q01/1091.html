<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:
<br>
Crosslink-breaking drug ALT-711 to be tested for hypertension
<br>
<p>Alteon Corporation has announced a phase 2B trial of their anti-crosslink
<br>
drug ALT-711 to be tested in patients with isolated systolic hypertension.
<br>
Systolic hypertension, characterized by a high systolic and normal
<br>
diastolic blood pressure reading, has recently gained attention as the
<br>
most common form of hypertension in individuals aged 50 and older.  An
<br>
elevation in systolic blood pressure has been associated with a high risk
<br>
of cardiovascular and all cause mortality.
<br>
<p>ALT-711 is one of a new class of compounds called advanced glycosylation
<br>
endproduct crosslink breakers.  These drugs have the ability to break
<br>
crosslinks caused by glycosylation, which is the binding of sugar to
<br>
protein molecules. The resultant crosslinkage destroys the elasticity of
<br>
tissue over time, leading to a loss of function. Glycosylation-induced
<br>
damage occurs more frequently with age and with diabetes. Crosslinkage in
<br>
the vacular system creates hardening of the arteries, or arteriosclerosis.
<br>
When blood vessels cannot expand, blood pressure becomes elevated.
<br>
<p>The new trial has been named SAPPHIRE, which stands for Systolic And Pulse
<br>
Pressure Hemodynamic Improvement by Restoring Elasticity.  Four hundred
<br>
fifty patients age 50 and older with isolated systolic hypertension in
<br>
forty sites in the US will receive the drug for six months in addition to
<br>
the medications they are currently taking.  In a previous trial of ALT-711
<br>
in cardiovascular disease patients, participants experienced increased
<br>
elasticity of the vascular wall and lower pulse pressure.
<br>
<p>The drug has proven effective in all species tested. Robert C deGroof PhD,
<br>
Senior Vice President of Scientific Affairs at alteon commented, &quot;It is
<br>
important to emphasize that our data thus far has been consistent across
<br>
all species that we have tested. In preclinical evaluations, ALT-711
<br>
reversed stiffening of the aorta in rodents,canines and non-human
<br>
primates, similar to what recently has been observed in humans. The
<br>
SAPPHIRE trial has been designed to confirm all of these results and to
<br>
further determine effects of ALT-711 over a longer period of time and a
<br>
wider range of dosages.&quot;
<br>
<p>ALT-711 does not interfere with natural glycosylation sites or peptide
<br>
bonds, and only breaks abnormal crosslinking. As there are no approved
<br>
drugs that treat the stiffening of the arteries that leads to isolated
<br>
systolic hypertension, ALT-711 will offer a new pharmaceutical therapy for
<br>
this undertreated condition, as well as for other cardiovascular disorders
<br>
associated with aging.
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
Prevention ignored in half of stroke and heart attack survivors
<br>
<p>A study published in the July 9 2001 issue of Archives of Internal
<br>
Medicine showed that many survivors of stroke and heart attack are not
<br>
taking measures to prevent a second event. The study was conducted by
<br>
researchers at the University of Buffalo Toshiba Stroke Research Center
<br>
and Department of Neurosurgery who analyzed data collected from 17,752
<br>
people from 1988 to 1996 who took part in the National Health and
<br>
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). NHANES was conducted by the CDC
<br>
to estimate the prevalence of chronic disease and identify risk factors.
<br>
<p>The data revealed that 53% of the 1,252 stroke and heart attack survivors
<br>
who had uncontrolled hypertension prior to their cardiovascular event were
<br>
still hypertensive after the event, and 46% who had high cholesterol
<br>
previous to their heart attack of stroke failed to control it afterward.
<br>
And as testimony to the power of addiction, 18% of smokers did not give up
<br>
their habits.

<br>
<p><p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Hypertension
<br>
<p>A startling statistic in the May 4, 1999, edition of The New York Times
<br>
revealed that only 18% of people with high blood pressure (hypertension)
<br>
are successfully treated to achieve normotensive ranges. Untreated
<br>
hypertension carries enormous health risks, such as increased risk of
<br>
heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and eye disease, yet fear of
<br>
medication side effects and improper prescribing by physicians are
<br>
contributing to an epidemic of hypertension-induced disease.
<br>
<p>&quot;Blood pressure&quot; can be defined as the pressure or force that is applied
<br>
against the artery walls as blood is carried through the circulatory
<br>
system. It is recorded as a measurement of this force in relation to the
<br>
heart's pumping activity, and is measured in millimeters of mercury
<br>
(mmHg). The top number, or systolic pressure, is the measurement of the
<br>
pressure that occurs when the heart contracts or beats. The bottom number,
<br>
or diastolic pressure, is the measurement recorded between beats, while
<br>
the heart is at rest. The systolic number is placed over the diastolic
<br>
number. For example, 110/70 (read as &quot;110 over 70&quot;) means a systolic
<br>
pressure of 110 mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 70 mmHg. The systolic
<br>
number is always the higher of the two numbers.
<br>
<p>High doses of fish oil concentrates have lowered blood pressure in some
<br>
people. There are cardiovascular as well as other health benefits
<br>
associated with taking fish oil. A study published in the October 1997
<br>
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition stated that &quot;fish oils have been
<br>
shown to lower blood pressure in hypertensive subjects.&quot; According to a
<br>
January 1999 Journal of Nutrition study, the fatty acid DHA
<br>
(docosahexaenoic acid, obtained directly from fish oil) was shown to alter
<br>
the membrane fatty acid composition as well as the amount of ATP released
<br>
from vascular endothelial cells, and also decrease plasma noradrenaline.
<br>
The doctors who conducted this study stated that these factors may
<br>
ameliorate the rise in blood pressure normally associated with advancing
<br>
age. The Journal of Vascular Research (January 1998) corroborated these
<br>
findings by showing that the EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) fatty acid
<br>
fraction of fish oil, when administered to aged rats, increases the
<br>
release of ATP from the vascular endothelial cells, leading to repression
<br>
of the blood pressure rise seen with advancing age. The October 1997
<br>
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition stated that &quot;fish oil has a mild
<br>
blood pressure-lowering effect in both normal and mildly hypertensive
<br>
individuals.&quot;
<br>
<p>Several studies suggest that garlic may have protective effects against
<br>
cardiovascular diseases. One cross-sectional observational study reported
<br>
in Circulation, October 1997, tested the hypothesis that regular garlic
<br>
intake would delay the stiffening of the aorta related to aging. Chronic
<br>
garlic powder intake was shown to attenuate age-related increases in
<br>
aortic stiffness. Arterial stiffening with age is one cause of
<br>
hypertension. The doctors conducting this study stated, &quot;These data
<br>
strongly support the hypothesis that garlic intake had a protective effect
<br>
on the elastic properties of the aorta related to aging in humans. Garlic
<br>
supplements can be found at a wide range of prices and potencies, some not
<br>
even standardized and containing no certifiable amounts of active
<br>
ingredients.

<p>Super GLA/DHA
<br>
<p>Most people fail to obtain the optimal balance of essential fatty acids
<br>
from their diet.  That is why dietary supplements such as fish, primrose
<br>
and borage oils have become so popular among health conscious people.
<br>
Fatty acids serve as building blocks of nerve cells and cell membranes.
<br>
Without adequate levels of the friendly fats, dangerous saturated fats
<br>
will replace essential fatty acids within cell membranes, reducing
<br>
membrane fluidity and efficiency, and thereby starting a process of
<br>
premature aging and disease development.  By taking the right proportions
<br>
of essential fatty acids, we can maximize the production of beneficial
<br>
prostaglandins while minimizing production of harmful ones (such as
<br>
prostaglandin E2).
<br>
<p>Deficiencies of essential fatty acids have been linked to a wide range of
<br>
common disorders including:
<br>
<p>Cardiovascular disease
<br>
Hypertension
<br>
Elevated LDL cholesterol
<br>
Elevated triglycerides
<br>
Insulin resistance (leading to type II diabetes)
<br>
Dementia
<br>
Memory Loss
<br>
<p>To assure optimal fatty acid intake, the Life Extension buyers' Club has
<br>
designed a combination supplement consisting of GLA and DHA.

<br>
<p>Fats for Life
<br>
<p>Imagine a kind of fat that could help reduce cholesterol levels, lower
<br>
blood pressure, fight dementia and slow down the aging process. This fat
<br>
would be better than any known drug. Best of all, it is not a fantasy but
<br>
a reality. We are talking about certain polyunsaturated, natural fatty
<br>
acids, whose beneficial effects have been documented in thousands of
<br>
studies over the last decade. Of crucial importance, however, is taking
<br>
the right essential fatty acids in the correct balance.
<br>
<p>Fat is necessary for life. It is a key component in body chemistry and
<br>
energy storage. Knowing the difference between the beneficial essential
<br>
fatty acids (EFAs) and the harmful fats is of crucial importance for
<br>
health and longevity. Extensive research has made it clear that a reduced
<br>
or imbalanced intake of EFAs plays a significant role in the development
<br>
of many cardiovascular, neurological, metabolic and other age-related
<br>
degenerative diseases.
<br>
<p>This research has singled out two particularly beneficial fatty acids, GLA
<br>
and DHA, and pointed to an ideal balance between them that could guard
<br>
against disease and age-related disorders in many-fold ways. These key
<br>
fatty acids protect the cardiovascular system, lowering blood pressure,
<br>
raising good (HDL) cholesterol while lowering bad (LDL) cholesterol and
<br>
triglyceride levels. They reduce stress reactions, and may ameliorate
<br>
insulin resistance. GLA helps reverse the effects of aging on fatty acid
<br>
metabolism, while DHA is essential to the development and maintenance of
<br>
brain functions, being of crucial importance for children, as well as for
<br>
the elderly in prevention and treatment of dementia.
<br>
<p>The richest known source of GLA is borage oil (23% GLA), while DHA is
<br>
plentiful in cold water fish. GLA and DHA make a wonderful team for health
<br>
and longevity.

<p>In the News:  Blood Pressure Drug Reverses Sexual Dysfunction
<br>
<p>When treating blood pressure using drug therapy, The Life Extension
<br>
Foundation long ago recommended that members ask their doctors to
<br>
prescribe either Cozaar or Hyzaar.  These drugs are known as angiotension
<br>
II receptor antagonists because of their unique mechanism to block the
<br>
receptor sites of cells involved in inducing vascular constriction.
<br>
Hypertension is often caused by arterial inelasticity, also known as
<br>
vascular constriction.
<br>
<p>While old-line anti-hypertensive drugs such as the calcium channel
<br>
blockers continue to be heavily promoted to doctors, Life Extension
<br>
members were told years ago that Cozaar or Hyzaar were the superior class
<br>
of drugs. Some studies suggest that short acting calcium channel blockers
<br>
increase mortality,(1-3) while the angiotension II receptor antagonist
<br>
drugs like Cozaar and Hyzaar are remarkably safe and effective.
<br>
<p>A new study has just come out indicating that the active ingredient in
<br>
Cozaar and Hyaar (losartan) can significantly improve sex lives of men who
<br>
suffer from sexual dysfunction. This makes sense based on the beneficial
<br>
mechanism of action these drugs induce on the vascular system.
<br>
<p>It is important to note that these improvements only occurred in those who
<br>
reported sexual dysfunction to begin with. In other words, Cozaar does not
<br>
act as an aphrodisiac in those with normal sexual function, but for those
<br>
whose sex lives are compromised by hypertension, Cozaar was shown in this
<br>
study to produce significant sexual-enhancing effects.
