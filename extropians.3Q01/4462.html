Robotic Form and Function: Creatures and Humanoids

<br>
<p>Robotic beasts and machines
<br>
<p>Many of our robots will have forms dictated by their tasks, environments or
<br>
even our imaginations.  We can expect to see robotic insects, dogs, and birds
<br>
as well as robotic cars, boats, and perhaps washing machines. Robotics may
<br>
represent the greatest unmet technological expectation of the twentieth
<br>
century, but many of those expectations will likely begin to be realized early
<br>
in the twenty-first.
<br>
<p>Advances in artificial intelligence technologies are critical to this
<br>
progress. One example is situated machine learning. Reinforcement learning can
<br>
be used for an unsupervised, learning-with-critic approach where mappings from
<br>
precepts to actions are learned inductively through trial and error. Other
<br>
approaches may include evolutionary methods that begin with an initial pool of
<br>
program elements, and then use genetic operators such as recombination and
<br>
mutation to produce successive generations of increasingly successful
<br>
controllers.
<br>
<p>These approaches (as well as others) will teach robots to adjust parameters,
<br>
exploit patterns, evolve rule sets, generate behaviors (and aggregations of
<br>
behaviors), devise new strategies, predict changes in the environment, and
<br>
even exchange this knowledge with other robots. Such robots can acquire new
<br>
knowledge, as well as adapt existing knowledge to new circumstances, and
<br>
thereby solve problems in ways we humans may not understand. Indeed, emergent
<br>
behavior, rather than being suppressed by careful design, may instead be
<br>
encouraged by equally careful design.
<br>
<p>As robots become more pervasive, then like automobiles they are likely to
<br>
become increasingly complex.  Indeed, some robots may be comprised of millions
<br>
of parts.  If fast, cheap, rapid manufacture of these robots is to occur, it
<br>
may be necessary to remove humans from the process altogether.  Jordan Pollack
<br>
and his colleagues at Brandeis are using commercial CADCAM simulators together
<br>
with a genetic algorithm to evolve the body and brains of simple robots.  They
<br>
have succeeded in automatically designing, improving, and creating a real
<br>
robot with only trivial human intervention.  So far, the work has focused
<br>
solely on creating a robot for locomotion but, eventually, this approach may
<br>
allow cheap, near-perfect solutions to be evolved and deployed, even for
<br>
complex tasks requiring unintuitive solutions.
<br>
<p>Humanoid Robots
<br>
<p>Humanoid robotics includes a rich diversity of projects where perception,
<br>
processing, and action are embodied in a recognizably anthropomorphic form in
<br>
order to emulate some subset of the physical, cognitive, and social dimensions
<br>
of the human body and experience, with the goal of creating a new kind of
<br>
tool.  Such a tool would be intended to work not just for humans but also with
<br>
them.  Humanoids will be able to work safely along side humans in typical,
<br>
everyday environments, as well as the more daunting environments of space and
<br>
underseas, and thereby extend our capabilities in ways we cannot at present
<br>
imagine.
<br>
<p>Indeed, humanoids may prove to be the ideal robot design to interact with
<br>
people.  After all, humans tend to naturally interact with other human-like
<br>
entities; the interface may well be hardwired in our brains.  Their
<br>
human-like, robot bodies will allow them to seamlessly blend into environments
<br>
already designs for humans.  While we humans have historically adapted to the
<br>
limitations of our machines, here the machines will be designed to adapt to
<br>
us.  Humanoids will not only provide a new way for us to interact with
<br>
machines, but may also serve as an intuitive filter for humans to interact
<br>
with an increasingly ubiquitous and pervasive information environment.
<br>
<p>Humanoid robots that can incrementally acquire new knowledge from autonomous
<br>
interactions with the environment will accomplish tasks by means their
<br>
designers did not explicitly implement (or perhaps even conceive of), and will
<br>
perhaps thereby be capable of adapting to the unanticipated circumstances of
<br>
an unstructured, dynamic environment.  Already, humanoid robots have
<br>
demonstrated basic task decomposition necessary to carry out complex commands
<br>
given through gesture and speech.  Humanoids have also demonstrated the
<br>
ability to adapt, to orchestrate existing capabilities, and to create new
<br>
behaviors using a variety of machine learning techniques.
<br>
<p>Humanoid robots may well rekindle a new inspiration for artificial
<br>
intelligence as they motivate research toward intelligent, autonomous systems.
<br>
Already, a growing number of robotics researchers have found that the human
<br>
form provides an excellent platform upon which to enable real-world learning.
<br>
A ''similar'' body facilitates learning based upon imitation, by making it
<br>
easier to map the human's action onto the robot.  In fact, it may be that
<br>
human-like intelligence actually requires a human-like body.  As a minimum,
<br>
the anthropomorphic form factor of these robots enables them to easily
<br>
interface with existing technology and infrastructure with minimal disruption.
<br>
Hence, humanoids appear to be a uniquely appropriate form factor by which to
<br>
gradually introduce 'intelligent' robots into new application domains.
