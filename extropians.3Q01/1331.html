How Hot Is It In Hell?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a true story)
<br>
<p>A thermodynamics professor had written a take home exam for his
<br>
graduate students. It had one question:  &quot;Is Hell exothermic (gives
<br>
off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?  Support your answer with a
<br>
proof.&quot;
<br>
<p>Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law
<br>
(gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or
<br>
some variant.
<br>
<p>One student, however, wrote the following:
<br>
<p>First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time.  So,
<br>
we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate
<br>
they are leaving.  I think that we can safely assume that once a soul
<br>
gets to Hell, it will not leave.  Therefore, no souls are leaving.
<br>
<p>As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different
<br>
religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state
<br>
that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell.
<br>
Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do
<br>
not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people
<br>
and all souls go to Hell.  With birth and death rates as they are, we
<br>
can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.
<br>
<p>Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because
<br>
Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in
<br>
Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are
<br>
added. This gives two possibilities:
<br>
<p>1). If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls
<br>
enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase
<br>
until all Hell breaks loose.
<br>
<p>2). Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase
<br>
of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until
<br>
Hell freezes over.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So which is it?
<br>
<p>If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan during my
<br>
Freshman year, &quot;That it will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with
<br>
you,&quot;  and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded
<br>
in having sexual relations with her, then #2 cannot be true, and so
<br>
Hell is exothermic.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student got the only A.
