<em>&gt; How many Americans have been killled by bad technology (techno-terrorism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you will) over the past decade compared to those killed by human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists? By preventable traffic fatalities and preventable pollution,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.
</em><br>
<p>Traffic fatalities are between a half to a third of what they were 10-15
<br>
years ago. Pollution is also far less than 20-30 years ago. I'm old
<br>
enough to remember rivers flowing with slicks on them, the only fish
<br>
living in them were eels, where rusty drinking water was a common
<br>
occurence in the public water system, and where the exhaust of every car
<br>
could visibly be seen in any weather conditions, among many other signs
<br>
of a choking world. That we made the world better was by our own choice,
<br>
and any deaths that continue to occur do so because we generally feel
<br>
that while conditions may not be as good as they can be, they are good
<br>
enough to go about our daily business. Any improvements we make in the
<br>
future will also be because we CHOOSE to make it so. 
<br>
Terrorism and the deaths it causes are not the choice of those it
<br>
victimizes, but that is also a matter of how poorly most people consider
<br>
and calculate risks in their lives. We can do better, but it is not our
<br>
fault that these things occur. We need to do better, and it is evident
<br>
that the risks are far higher than most had assumed. Many of us did not
<br>
want to recognise the risks, because we like to live in a world that
<br>
relies on trusting our fellow humans will always be good. Others trusted
<br>
the wrong people far too much. Now we must learn to delineate between
<br>
other human beings and other citizens. If the events of the past few
<br>
weeks have shown anything, we can still trust our fellow citizens to do
<br>
great things and to care about each other. We can also learn that most
<br>
people in the world feel the same way, but there is also a sizable
<br>
population of people who do not get it, do not want to get it, and will
<br>
either kill us or be killed before they get it.
