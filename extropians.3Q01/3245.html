<em>&gt; &gt; Well, my personal opinion is that education is the prime problem, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the prime solution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, most school educations don't include courses on how to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it in the real world, especially for students from disadvantaged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backgrounds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any ideas on making USEFUL educations available--not necessarily just for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor kids, but for all kids who're interested? It might be a worthwhile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropian project.
</em><br>
<p>Well, one thing I've noticed that is different between the US
<br>
educational system and those of european and other countries that rate
<br>
higher is that the US system tends to treat every student like they need
<br>
either a college prep curriculum or else glorified nose wiping.
<br>
Vocational training at the high school level is almost non-existent in
<br>
the US today.
<br>
<p>There seems to be this prevailing notion in Education university
<br>
departments that 'mainstreaming' is of paramount importance, that
<br>
preparing kids for being functional adults isn't, and that providing
<br>
'special ed' programs for the low end students is more important than
<br>
providing advanced training for smart kids, to the point that AP classes
<br>
are seen as extraneous, a frivolity seen only in wealth school
<br>
districts.
<br>
<p>In recent years, schools have treated 'computer class' as the sole
<br>
vocational training worthy of treatment by high schools, as if there
<br>
isn't a huge demand for skilled machinists and other trades people, and
<br>
often at the expense of those programs that do remain in those areas.
<br>
<p>Educators are focused on 'education' as some catch all suitcase term,
<br>
when they actually ignore, or are completely incompetent to teach
<br>
specialized courses, from math and computers to machining, carpentry,
<br>
and auto mechanics. I personally think that 'education' should only be a
<br>
minor for college students seeking to become teachers in grades K-12,
<br>
that they should have their major in a real skill area like math,
<br>
history, or english, etc. Even those who wish to become university
<br>
professors in Education should have a specialty in a real skill area
<br>
beyond 'education'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know a public school teacher in Lockhart, Texas who's using gardening as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way of reaching kids who don't like books. I interviewed some of the kids
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a magazine article and was told by several of them that they used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hate going to school but now enjoy it because of the garden (they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growing all sorts of plants, including food, useful stuff such as gourds,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and native ornamentals), and were in the process of installing a fish pond.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When kids have a reason to learn, they'll learn. These kids had been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inspired by the garden to learn about botany, weather, genetics, chemistry,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; folklore, economics, design, math, and more. We're a poor community, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the students are from homes where there are no books at all.
</em><br>
<p>Your last statement here is the telling one. As I've said, the primary
<br>
problem with educating minorities and other poor kids is that education,
<br>
knowledge, etc tends to have little or no respect in their homes. The
<br>
absence of books from the home is highly indicative of this.
<br>
<p>Frankly, I consider any parent with less than 100 books in their home to
<br>
be guilty of child neglect. Any parent who thinks that books aren't
<br>
necessary for raising kids is not fit to be a parent.
