From: Anders Sandberg:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The renaissance involved trying to create something new that unified
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the old knowledge with the new scientific/economic/artistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discoveries, and then change society accordingly
</em><br>
<p>'Trying' might not be the best word...    :-)
<br>
<p>The areas of arts, literature, music, philosophy, politics,
<br>
economics, science, each underwent major developments from
<br>
1300-1700, which occurred at staggered (not coinciding) times. I
<br>
don't know if the experts are still debating what caused the
<br>
Renaissance, but my art history texts state that that the
<br>
Renaissance was the first period in history to be aware of its own
<br>
existence to coin a label for itself. Moreover, it divided the past
<br>
on the basis of *human achievements*. &quot;Individualism&quot;, first set in
<br>
the Greek times, emerged anew, only the Renaissance people didn't
<br>
want to just recreate again, what the Greeks accomplished. Instead,
<br>
the Renaissance people wanted to build on those ancient ideas and
<br>
then take those ideas further into new directions.
<br>
<p>It's fun to look at a Time-Line of some of the events occuring
<br>
during those early Renaissance years. On the heels of the Black
<br>
Death (1340s):
<br>
<p>Literature: Petrarch (1300s): the first &quot;humanist&quot;
<br>
<p>Technology: The Guttenberg printing press developed (1445) and
<br>
demand began for different kinds of books
<br>
<p>Political: Constantinople fell to the Turks (1453), Columbus
<br>
discovers America (1492), Hundred Years' War ends (1453)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I see many similarities with today:
</em><br>
<p>Yes
<br>
<p><em>&gt;we need a new renaissance to unify the old knowledge with the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discoveries and then find ways of changing our societies accordingly.
</em><br>
<p>Yes
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The fact that there are people trying to bridge the two cultures and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;create a new synthesis isn't enough, as long as they stand fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alone and unsupported. What made the daring transdisciplinary work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the renaissance so important was that it took place in a cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;context where it gained support and influence - the actual number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humanists, scientists, artists and engineers were fairly low, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they affected society profoundly through various channels.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, The conditions in Italian civilization seemed to be primed for
<br>
the first Renaissance seeds to germinate and flower. The revival of
<br>
the ancient Greek and Roman works by the humanists would not have
<br>
gone very far if it wasn't united with the culture and genius of the
<br>
Italian people. Then from Italy, the Renaissance spread to the rest
<br>
of Europe like a breath of fresh air. Wonderful!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We need to find the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;modern counterparts of these channels of reaching into society and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for creating a cultural context that promotes synthesis.
</em><br>
<p>Then let's start, (as the Italians did), with the Greeks, shall we?
<br>
<p>With the Greeks, we find that science, research, and the acquisition
<br>
of knowledge remain apart from religious and political authority.
<br>
With the Greeks, we find that military power operates under, and is
<br>
checked by, civilian control. We find a constitutional and
<br>
consentual government. We find that private property and free
<br>
economic activity are immune from government. With the Greeks, we
<br>
find the notion of dissent and open criticism of government,
<br>
religion and military. With the Greeks, we find a strong harmony
<br>
between man's word and deed based on the man's ethos and pact with
<br>
himself, which ultimately, determines his own destiny. With the
<br>
Greeks, we find a trust in the &quot;polis&quot;, to provide the check against
<br>
a human's huge ability for harm and destruction.
<br>
<p>It's a good place to start, isn't? Presently I'm aware of several
<br>
places in the world where scholars are working hard to educate the
<br>
public about the value of Greek ideas, and also to influence
<br>
politicians to adopt many of these ideas. We can educate ourselves
<br>
and others, as well.
<br>
<p>Once basic principles have been adopted (which is up to the
<br>
individual), then we can look at other aspects of our cultures to
<br>
build the connections to forge a synthesis. I'll go on to Natasha's
<br>
comments about this.
<br>
<p>Natasha says:
<br>
<em>&gt;The numerous electronic art conferences approach this synthesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Anders. In fact, for the past decade, these conferences have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inviting scientists to give key talks.
</em><br>
<p>About forging links between science and art, which would play a role
<br>
in the next 'Renaissance',
<br>
<p>Here I think that it's important to notice, recognize, accept, and
<br>
support scientists who are &quot;synthesists&quot;. You won't often find these
<br>
people in mainstream science circles. You might find them through
<br>
their published books, but I don't think that you will find many in
<br>
the normal universities and research laboratories. The reason for
<br>
this is that, even though I know that many scientists have a strong
<br>
aesthetic sense (I've noticed especially a strong correlation with
<br>
scientists being musicians), the scientific activities and funding
<br>
structure do not encourage scientists to be generalists. The
<br>
scientific-art synthesists are actually the generalists, who cross
<br>
often scientific boundaries and who see a larger picture and carry a
<br>
&quot;vision&quot;. They are the Feynmans, Dysons, Deutsches, Drexlers,
<br>
Minskeys, Mandelbrots, Barrows, Goulds, Asimovs, Dewdneys,
<br>
Pickovers, Knuths, Kernighans, Dawkins, for example. If we continue
<br>
to pay attention to these kinds of people, discussing their
<br>
activities, and encouraging those activities, each in our own way, I
<br>
think that is a good step in the right direction. I'm not saying
<br>
that all of these people are artists, but they are the kind of
<br>
people who sythesize well, leading to flowers which can bloom, to
<br>
bring about the next 'Renaissance'.
<br>
<p>Next, as Anders said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sure, I am merely reiterating the same concept. But I think it needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be restated again and again among ourselves, so that more of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actually go out and create this Enlightenment. While there are many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stellar examples of both renaissance persons and people actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;promoting the new enlightenment among us, there should be far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people doing it!
</em><br>
<p>We can do it ourselves! The Greeks were do-ers, and so are we, yes?
<br>
<p>How about this, Anders: Now that the 'Globalization' has set about
<br>
some currency simplification to bring about the Euro, let's ask the
<br>
people of the world to agree next on some standards for office
<br>
supplies and electrical power. Think how it would simplify our
<br>
lives! We wouldn't have to waste extra time and attention for
<br>
different countries: formatting documents differently, punching
<br>
holes differently, using different sized envelopes, paper, holders,
<br>
folders, staplers, file cabinets, making different-sized business
<br>
cards, having the right electrical adapter and power converter. We
<br>
could spend that valuable time on creating a high-quality object of
<br>
interest, instead.
<br>
<p>(she says, grumpily, after recognizing this weekend that she must
<br>
reconstruct a nontrivial part of her US photo darkroom to work in
<br>
Germany)
<br>
<p>By the way, I really like examples of artists who have some
<br>
knowledge of science, or scientists who have some experience with
<br>
art, creating and presenting a piece of scientific artwork. Even if
<br>
the viewer of the piece does not recognize or understand the
<br>
scientific aspects, the artwork still plants a seed in the viewer's
<br>
mind. That is, an image that goes into the viewer's subconscious,
<br>
and then gurgles happily away. I've been thinking alot of the
<br>
&quot;Longest Art Gallery&quot; of the Stockholm subway system that you
<br>
(Anders) showed me a few weeks ago, in particular the piece near the
<br>
KTH exit: a geometrical idealized representation of the event
<br>
horizon of a black hole. Is a description of that artpiece written
<br>
up anywhere? Does the average subway-goer who exits from that stop
<br>
know what that artpiece represents? I would gues that after a person
<br>
passes under those geometrical objects a hundred times or so, he/she
<br>
would eventually become curious and want to learn more.
<br>
<p>More about planting seeds, as Natasha says:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The best way to &quot;infiltrate&quot; the environments which you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;referring to is to be there. It is not a game plan, it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;presence. Ideas permeate best at the comfort zone level where people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do not feel pressured. Going into an environment and pushing an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agenda is usually met with a counter force. Going in an introducing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an agenda through persuasive credibility and a collaborative spirit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is usually met with a welcome.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely. Also, approaching people from the side of the arts, in
<br>
order to discuss strong philosophical ideas is often more
<br>
comfortable for everyone, as well. Even if learning about their
<br>
worldview is not your original intention. For example, engaging new
<br>
people in discussions about music, films, books, can naturally lead
<br>
to nice discoveries of their personal political and philosophical
<br>
views. Once they are talking and sharing their views, then you can
<br>
too.
<br>
<p>Now let's assume that we are carrying some deep principles in our
<br>
hearts and minds, and that we are &quot;doing&quot; the things that we love in
<br>
our daily lives, and along the way, planting seeds about our
<br>
passions. As stated earlier, the Renaissance would not have occured
<br>
if the individual efforts took place in isolation, therefore let's
<br>
pay attention to the connections. One very big thing that we have
<br>
today that our ancestors did not have is the Internet. Sitting on
<br>
top of the Internet are layers on top of layers of some fascinating
<br>
experiments regarding people links and connections. I'm stating the
<br>
obvious, I know, but I'll say it anyway, use these connections! The
<br>
next Renaissance needs our Internet connections.
<br>
<p>To end this note, let me present an idea. Create a list of
<br>
&quot;Renaissance Books.&quot; In this list are particular books that made an
<br>
impact on you (or on people close to you) which synthesize
<br>
ideas or else could be a solid connection node for synthesizing other
<br>
ideas. In some of these books, valuable ideas could be hidden in
<br>
fictional stories or poetry. The goal of thinking of such a thing,
<br>
simply, is to recognize those efforts by &quot;synthesists&quot;, and to help
<br>
forge connections (different areas, or to help between old and new ideas).
<br>
I made my own list yesterday and had fun with it. I'll give my own
<br>
&quot;Renaissance Library&quot;,  if anyone is interested.
