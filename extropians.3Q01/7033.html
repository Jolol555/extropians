</em><br>
<p>Greg, I hope I am not missing your point here, but it seems clear to me 
<br>
that the justification of violence via religious text is true of most 
<br>
religions...not the least of which being Christianity.  You know as well as 
<br>
I do that the general focus of a religion is determined by how such text is 
<br>
interpreted by those who preach it, and the following allusions to text in 
<br>
the Koran apply equally to text in the Bible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   The simple and undisputable fact is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there is clear and explicit language in the Koran that:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &lt;&gt; endorses the use of violence against &quot;unbelievers&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &lt;&gt; requires that Islamic countries institute legal discrimination against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-Muslims
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &lt;&gt; demands unequal treatment of women
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How do we, as a free people, come to terms with these facts? How do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moderate Muslims rationalize their calls for peace and tolerance in light of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the clear and unambiguous text of their scripture to the contrary?
</em><br>
<p>In the same way the average Westerner does: by finding passages that can be 
<br>
appropriately interpreted to mean the opposite of others.  Any culture 
<br>
--Western, Muslim or otherwise-- that bases its beliefs almost solely on 
<br>
the writings of a single book can not make *any* rational justifications 
<br>
whatsoever, so long as they are guided by religion.  The primary difference 
<br>
I have detected between the way Western civilization conducts itself and 
<br>
the way Muslim etc. conducts itself is that the former claims to have 
<br>
religious imperative but seems to make the most rational choice regardless 
<br>
of that claim.  Eastern religions tend to have much more of a narrow focus 
<br>
which their proponents adhere to more strictly.  I don't see this as a 
<br>
problem with the books (Bible vs. Koran, Bhagavad Gita etc.) so much as a 
<br>
problem with the narrowness of interpretation...and such interpretation, as 
<br>
you mention, has formed some Eastern cultural law.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   How can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;democracy flourish in cultures where a religion based on that scripture is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enshrined in law? These are the hard questions that our contemporary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cultural relativism apparently makes it impossible to ask.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that democracy *can* flourish in those countries without 
<br>
widespread cultural assimilation.  It brings up the more difficult question 
<br>
of whether people are more willing to quell culture for the sake of 
<br>
politics or quell politics for the preservation of culture.
