<em>&gt; The project IS progressing well.  The Timeship is the brainchild
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Saul Kent and his business partner Will Faloon.  They are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; founders and owners of the Life Extension Foundation, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multi-million dollar online health supplement company.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.lef.org">http://www.lef.org</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saul and Will are going to spend $180 million dollars of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own money to pay for the construction of the Timeship!!  These
</em><br>
<em>&gt; men mean business. :)  Somehow, I can't envision the Timeship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being built if it were dependant on donations from us! :(
</em><br>
<p>Much as I hate commenting on how anyone else spends their money, one can't
<br>
help but imagine that this $180 million would create a far greater good for
<br>
the life extension movement if it were to be used to create a foundation
<br>
with the sole goal of pushing life extension further into the mainstream.
<br>
You can look on that as seeding for more money to come back later...
<br>
<p>That said, the LEF site claims $2 million in research grants put out each
<br>
year, AIR. These two figures seem a little out of order. If they can throw
<br>
$180 at what is essentially a symbol filled with some good tech, corpsicles
<br>
and laboratories, why can't they have thrown ten times as much at basic
<br>
research and publicity over the past few years since the FDA graded their
<br>
legal nastiness back down to merely malignant? Back seat driving on my part,
<br>
but I'm curious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From where I sit, the whole timeship thing carries with it an air of retreat
</em><br>
from the world, lock yourself up, elitism thing. Which is quite possibly a
<br>
perception that would be cured by a discussion with any of the people
<br>
involved, but there you have it: that's how it comes across to me, the
<br>
uninvolved.
<br>
<p>So my (biased -- <a href="http://www.longevitymeme.org">http://www.longevitymeme.org</a>) frustration is that we have
<br>
an essentially fringe movement (life extension), an organization that has
<br>
made great inroads in de-fringing and making respectable at least the
<br>
health-vitamin-supplement-tweaking portion of life extension, and which then
<br>
considers the timeship project to be the best foot forward!
<br>
<p>Until life extension is a mainstream topic -- as well known and thought
<br>
about as AIDs prevention, for example -- then so much of this work all seems
<br>
futile. In order to make rapid enough progress for most of us, we are going
<br>
to have to engineer a sea change in the way in which the world views aging.
<br>
If we don't, then we're going to be dead. Possibly frozen, but nonetheless
<br>
frozen and dead and in a society that doesn't have a whole lot of interest
<br>
in keeping us frozen, or in reviving us, if that's even possible.
<br>
<p>So: cart before horse. Societal engineering first, then you'll have a
<br>
society willing to build as many timeships as you like.
