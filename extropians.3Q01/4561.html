<em>&gt; That said, their AI theory most certainly appears to suck, and I would put

</em><br>
<em>&gt; incoherent babblings they've achieved are every bit as dumb as they
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity.
</em><br>
<p>I was disturbed by their examples, as well.  They claimed that they were
<br>
nonsensical in the sense of a child's ramblings.  That did not appear to me
<br>
to be the case.  Children do not randomly make non sequitur.  They play
<br>
games, have imaginary friends, and change topics frequently.  But they do
<br>
not accidentally pull up the wrong information from their brain and spew it
<br>
out in answer to the wrong question.  I also didn't understand the concept
<br>
of the computer wanting bananas on a trip.  Unless this is an android that
<br>
simulates eating and has taste sensors, this is meaningless.  How did the
<br>
computer &quot;learn&quot; to &quot;like&quot; bananas?  If it can't eat, how does it &quot;like&quot;
<br>
them.  This does not compare to a child who likes bananas.  I found the
<br>
examples to be more counter-examples of AI.  (Unfortunately!)
