<p>What i am now wondering are the evolved human features that allow the 
<br>
irrational
<br>
constructs to exist an important or even essential component of sentience.
<br>
<p>### The book &quot;Religion explained&quot; (I forgot it's author's name), recently
<br>
discussed on this list, gives some coherent, detailed and quite compelling
<br>
answers to this question.
<br>
<p>Our evolved neural mechanisms, mainly devoted to the analysis of social
<br>
interactions (intuitive psychology) are prone to recognize certain ideas as
<br>
&quot;salient&quot;, leading to many inferences, and therefore likely to be
<br>
remembered. These ideas evolve over time and gain sophistication, co-opting
<br>
many parts of our brain in their spread. What starts as a vague idea of
<br>
&quot;ancestors&quot; who know of our misdeeds and can be bargained with, develops
<br>
over a few thousand years into a complicated system of rules and fantasies,
<br>
intricately linked to the fabric of the society, and supported by secondary
<br>
types of interactions (coalition building, formation of memetic &quot;brand
<br>
names&quot;, like Christianity, and others). 
<br>
<p>Good book. I knew religion was silly since I was 7 years old but now I know
<br>
why it is so persistent.
<br>
<p>The AI, if executed properly, could be just as impervious to Rev. Falwell's
<br>
blandishments as the staunchest infidels on our list, if not more.
