<p><em>&gt;It makes me feel sad that some people feel so unconcerned at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought of wiping away a whole segment of society. Don't they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remember why public school exists? There is this waving of arms
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and saying &quot;Leave it to the magic of the free market -- that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fix it.&quot; But all it will fix is that the rich will have less tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to pay and the poor will go without education... and backwards we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;march to the bad old days.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think anyones out to eliminate education, but many of us
<br>
have problems with both its lack of success, and the way it's
<br>
currently paid for.
<br>
<p>In the system I'm currently proposing (a flat tax structure)
<br>
everyone would pay something for education, but the bulk of the
<br>
cost would be borne by the parents. If you want to have a half
<br>
dozen kids fine, but be sure to check your wallet first...
<br>
<p>There is nothing backward in this.
