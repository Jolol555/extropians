<p>It is going to be economical soon after we'll establish a teleoperated

bridgehead on the Moon. So, the real problem for deploying cheap cheap

energy everywhere is about developing industrial processes in a hard
<br>
vacuum, and packaging that into a boostrap sequence deployable with
<br>
current or near-future technologies. So, somebody build a lunar simulator
<br>
(cum teleoperation latency) the size of a tennis court, allocate a budget,
<br>
and let smart people play with it.

<p>The launch problem is really tough. It is really more interesting working
<br>
with what you have.

<p>You, personally? ExI? Excuse me, by definition you're asking for resources
<br>
which few 0.1% of the world command. What makes you think you're going to
<br>
wind up one of the 'leet?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It has been theorized that low gravity may retard natural aging, or at
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This is bogus, of course. Staying in LEO damages you, and not only due to
<br>
the noise and the chemical contamination. Monkeys are not built for space,
<br>
not even microgravity.
