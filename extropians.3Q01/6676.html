<em>&gt; Jason Walker is mistaken. I do not think that the United States should give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one inch to terrorism WHEN OUR INTERESTS AND PRINCIPLES ARE AT STAKE. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America has no interest in being allied with Israel. Nor do we have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant commonality of values. Israel is more like the hated Muslim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries than like the United States. Morally speaking, the Jews in Israel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are no better than their neighbors. Do the Arabs torture and assassinate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their enemies? So do the Israelis. Are the Arab states run by terrorists and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass murderers? So is Israel. (Shamir was a terrorist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Begin a terrorist, Barak a trained assassin, and Sharon is a butcher.) Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arab states sponsor terrorism? So does Israel. Are Arab countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-capitalist? So is Israel. Are Arabs tribal and collectivist? So are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jews. Do Muslim states base their laws on revealed religion? Some of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do. But so does Israel. Do most Jews and Arabs actively take part in these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policies? No. Do most of them give their tacit consent? Absolutely.
</em><br>
<p>The US sponsors terrorism, is partially anti-capitalist, etc.  I
<br>
guess the US is more like Israel and the Muslim countries than ...
<br>
what?  They're all the same!  That's silly.  I condemn the US
<br>
government every chance I get, but it's clear that it's much, much,
<br>
much better than the average terran government, and the government
<br>
of Israel is at least much better than average.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;So we tell the Americans as people, and we tell the mothers of soldiers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American mothers in general that if they value their lives and the lives of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their children, to find a nationalistic government that will look after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their interests and not the interests of the Jews.
</em><br>
<p>Israel is not the only US interest in the region, and isn't what
<br>
got us into hot water with Bin Laden.  Try containing the USSR and
<br>
maintaining access to Persian Gulf oil.
<br>
<p>I think Greg Johnson's arguments are asinine and sound rather
<br>
bigoted, though we may agree on the best course of action:  stop
<br>
meddling.
