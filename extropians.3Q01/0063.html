You don't need all the ice to melt to have an interesting flood. In 1949 there was an
<br>
eruption of the Cumbre Vieja volcano in the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa,
<br>
it created a huge fissure across the western side of the island that is gradually getting
<br>
wider. Someday it will break off and when it does 500 billion tons of rock will fall
<br>
two and a half miles to the bottom of the sea. The bad news is that this will create a wave
<br>
2,100 feet high moving at 450 mph, the good news is that by the time this wall of water
<br>
reaches the east coast of Canada and the USA 8 hours later it will only be 160 feet high,
<br>
so it will only go inland on average about 12 miles. There is pretty good evidence that this
<br>
sort of thing happened before, 120 thousand years ago a large part El Hierro also in the
<br>
Canary islands fell into the sea, this may explain puzzling chevron shaped ridges and
<br>
2000 ton boulders in odd places in the Bahamas. There is also a fissure on the
<br>
big island of Hawaii that will do a similar job on the Pacific someday.
