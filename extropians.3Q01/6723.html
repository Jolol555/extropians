<p>I'm not very well informed on Afghanistan, but based on the thoughtful
<br>
and well-researched pieces we've seen on this list I believe that
<br>
your characterization of the situation is incorrect. In essence, the
<br>
US and Pakistan supported a genuine pan-islamic movement to help the
<br>
Afghans free themselves from the Soviets. We weren't very picky about
<br>
who these people were. The net effect is that we bankrolled the creation
<br>
of a pan-islamic organization of in excess of 100,000 fighters. After
<br>
they had succeeded in their original goal, many of them went home.
<br>
Others, influenced by a variety of political and religious forces,
<br>
are now doing a bunch of other stuff. Some of them are now anti-US
<br>
fanatics. Very few of these people are the original Afghans.
<br>
<p>The Afghans are not by inclination or history islamic fundamentalists.
<br>
Those Buddhist statues had stood for more than 500 years before the
<br>
Taliban destroyed them. The Taliban was one of several fundamentalist
<br>
groups whose influence grew as a direct result of outsiders who were
<br>
part of the pan-islamic fight against the Soviets. It is not too far
<br>
wrong to say that the Taliban are a puppet government imposed on
<br>
Afghanistan by Pakistan.
<br>
<p>Basically, is it completely morally wrong to make war on the Afghans.
<br>
There are already a lot of Afghans who are fighting a civil war
<br>
against the Taliban. It may be acceptable to declare war on the
<br>
Taliban if they refuse to disavow bin Laden, but not on the Afghan
<br>
people.
<br>
<p>Our true enemy is that part of the pan-islamic organization that
<br>
switched from fighting the Soviets to fighting the US. The problem
<br>
is identifying them. They are now dispersed across the Islamic world,
<br>
and they are causing more problems for Islamic governments than they
<br>
do for us, even including the horrible events of 911.
