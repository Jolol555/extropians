<p>How big business bankrolls the sick trade in human body parts
<br>
Organs for sale - Israeli patients pay £100,000 a time for illegal
<br>
transplants in Istanbul
<br>
By Sue Lloyd-Roberts in Chisinau, Moldova
<br>
07 July 2001
<br>
In Europe's poorest country a predatory trade in body parts is
<br>
flourishing ­ paid for in part by Israeli health insurance companies ­
<br>
in order to feed the surging demand for transplant organs.
<br>
<p>The sale of body parts is illegal in every country except China and
<br>
Iran. But an investigation reveals that the production line starts in
<br>
Europe's most impoverished country, the republic of Moldova, and ends
<br>
up in Israel, via Turkey.
<br>
<p>One of the victims of this cruel trade, called Sergei, described how
<br>
an agent in the Moldovan capital, Chisinau, tricked him into
<br>
surrendering a kidney two years ago, after luring him to Turkey with
<br>
the promise of a job.
<br>
<p>When the job failed to materialise, the agent, Nina Scobiola, said
<br>
Sergei would have to sell blood to raise the bus fare back home. She
<br>
guided him to a private hospital on the outskirts of Istanbul and a
<br>
jab in the arm followed. &quot;My whole body was aching,&quot; he said, when he
<br>
came round. &quot;I couldn't get up. I had a feeling that something was
<br>
missing inside me.&quot;
<br>
<p>As the anaesthetic wore off, Sergei said, the agent simply walked
<br>
into the hospital room and said: &quot;We've taken a kidney. There's
<br>
nothing you can do. I'll give you £1,800 for it. Otherwise, get
<br>
yourself out of your predicament on your own.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sergei took the money and returned to Moldova. &quot;Six months later, all
<br>
I had left to remind me was a stamp in my passport and a pain in my
<br>
left side.&quot;
<br>
<p>The racket run by Ms Scobiola in Istanbul and a second Nina in the
<br>
village of Mingir is well known to the Moldovan police, and has left
<br>
many young men in the region with only one kidney. Most sell them
<br>
voluntarily. &quot;I am ashamed that we are doing this. We are a disgrace
<br>
to our country but there is no other way out of the situation,&quot; said
<br>
one villager, Vladimir, who willingly sold his kidney.
<br>
<p>The situation in post-Soviet Moldova, a country squashed between
<br>
Romania and Ukraine, is one of no jobs and no prospects. If a young
<br>
man wants to marry or buy a house he has only one asset of commercial
<br>
value to the world ­ his body parts.
<br>
<p>Veleriu Galit, of Moldova's Department of Organised Crime, said
<br>
the &quot;Two Ninas&quot;, as they are called, have the trade sewn up. One
<br>
procures the men in Moldovan villages. Then she calls Ms Scobiola in
<br>
Turkey. &quot;Once Scobiola gives the go-ahead, Nina puts them on a bus to
<br>
Turkey where the operations are carried out,&quot; said Mr Galit. &quot;The
<br>
doctors are Turkish. The recipients are mainly Israeli.&quot;
<br>
<p>The donors all remember the doctor who carried out the operation.
<br>
Yusuf Somnez is a kidney surgeon, trained at the Istanbul University
<br>
Hospital, who darts from one private clinic to another as the police
<br>
close in. After a Turkish television documentary in 1997 exposed his
<br>
activities, the Istanbul Health Authority banned him for life from
<br>
working in the public health sector. To pre-empt him, they refuse to
<br>
license any private clinic in the city to carry out kidney transplant
<br>
operations. But Dr Somnez keeps going.
<br>
<p>Ayan Mimaroglu, of the Turkish fraud squad, said the doctor was a
<br>
shrewd operator. &quot;He gets the donors to sign papers saying that they
<br>
are donating their organs voluntarily.&quot; He is ideally situated in
<br>
Istanbul, with an infinite supply of desperately poor, potential
<br>
donors in impoverished Moldova to the north and a queue of
<br>
desperately ill kidney patients in wealthy Israel, to the south-east.
<br>
One donor said he overheard a nurse saying 35 Israelis were waiting
<br>
in Istanbul for a new kidney from Dr Somnez. Each one was being
<br>
charged £100,000.
<br>
<p>Professor Jonathan Halevy, director of the Israeli Transplant Centre
<br>
in Tel Aviv, said he was embarrassed that his compatriots had created
<br>
this production line. Israel has a donor problem, he said, as few
<br>
carry donor cards, owing to &quot;a deep-seated belief among most Israelis
<br>
that they must go whole to the grave&quot;.
<br>
<p>Mike Levinsky was one of the first to go to Istanbul to be operated
<br>
on by Dr Somnez. &quot;I was aware that to pay for a kidney transplant is
<br>
illegal everywhere,&quot; he said. He did not meet the donor, even though
<br>
he was in the adjacent room at the hospital. Was he curious about the
<br>
man whose part he has inside him? &quot;No.&quot;
<br>
<p>Israeli insurance companies, known as Sick Funds, are partly financed
<br>
by the government. As a result, public money is helping to finance
<br>
illegal kidney transplants abroad. Professor Halevy admitted this. &quot;I
<br>
can't deny it and I condemn it,&quot; he said. &quot;But the Sick Funds are
<br>
facing an enrolee who says: 'I have no chance of a transplant in
<br>
Israel ­ at least pay me what you would have paid my hospital in
<br>
Israel.' They give him the money, usually about £25,000, towards
<br>
buying a new kidney.&quot;
<br>
<p>The sale of body parts remains anathema to most medical
<br>
establishments, although some doctors say that with 5,000 patients
<br>
waiting for kidney transplants in the UK, the idea should be
<br>
discussed.
<br>
<p>Back in Moldova, the donors are not reconciled to their loss. &quot;What
<br>
can I say to the Israeli who got my kidney?&quot; Sergei said. &quot;Even
<br>
though they got it through deceit, what is done is done. Let him be
<br>
healthy, but let it be on his conscience.&quot;
