This is part of a discussion, but I think it's enough for you to get the
<br>
gist of his position.  What do people on this list think?

Subject: OWL: Never Again
<br>
<p>Jason Walker is mistaken. I do not think that the United States should give
<br>
one inch to terrorism WHEN OUR INTERESTS AND PRINCIPLES ARE AT STAKE. But
<br>
America has no interest in being allied with Israel. Nor do we have a
<br>
significant commonality of values. Israel is more like the hated Muslim
<br>
countries than like the United States. Morally speaking, the Jews in Israel
<br>
are no better than their neighbors. Do the Arabs torture and assassinate
<br>
their enemies? So do the Israelis. Are the Arab states run by terrorists and
<br>
mass murderers? So is Israel. (Shamir was a terrorist,
<br>
Begin a terrorist, Barak a trained assassin, and Sharon is a butcher.) Do
<br>
Arab states sponsor terrorism? So does Israel. Are Arab countries
<br>
anti-capitalist? So is Israel. Are Arabs tribal and collectivist? So are
<br>
Jews. Do Muslim states base their laws on revealed religion? Some of them
<br>
do. But so does Israel. Do most Jews and Arabs actively take part in these
<br>
policies? No. Do most of them give their tacit consent? Absolutely.
<br>
<p>There is NO REASON to take sides in this conflict. And if the WTC bombing
<br>
wakes America up to this fact, then so be it. I'd prefer that we wake up now
<br>
than after a nuclear or biological or biochemical attack. As strange as this
<br>
may seem, the WTC attack was designed to get attention, not to inflict
<br>
maximum casualties. Much of the population of NYC could have been killed
<br>
with anthrax. But that would not be as telegenic as the WTC collapse.
<br>
<p>It is not an act of cowardice to admit that one has been wrong. Indeed, it
<br>
takes far more courage to admit one's error than it does to persist in it
<br>
and compound it with calls for the nuclear annihilation of the Muslim world.
<br>
<p>How do we make sure that it NEVER AGAIN occurs? Here's one answer:
<br>
<p>&quot;So we tell the Americans as people, and we tell the mothers of soldiers and
<br>
American mothers in general that if they value their lives and the lives of
<br>
their children, to find a nationalistic government that will look after
<br>
their interests and not the interests of the Jews.
<br>
<p>&quot;The continuation of tyranny will bring the fight to America, as Ramzi
<br>
Yousef
<br>
and others did. This is my message to the American people: to look for a
<br>
serious government that looks out for their interests and does not attack
<br>
others, their lands, or their honor. And my word to American
<br>
journalists is not to ask why we did that but ask what their government has
<br>
done that forced us to defend ourselves.&quot;--- Osama bin Laden, May 1998
