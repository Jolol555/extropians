<em>&gt; No, no, no... not &quot;direct truth&quot; -- rather direct _experience_.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; A name for it?? How 'bout existence. Yeah, that's it... The name of my

</em><br>
<p>Good answers, but I still feel like I am missing something.  I also call my
<br>
position &quot;the scientific study of existence&quot;.  However, your statements seem
<br>
to have assumptions or previous references that I am missing.  I don't
<br>
understand all your statements, but they do seem to be consistent and
<br>
repeatable:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When the brain observes, listens, and feels without commenting...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By direct experience in the absence of thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience is direct and may occur without any thought happening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience displaces the ordinary stream of thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct and unfiltered by thinking about it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct experience in the absence of thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diluted by thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If one remembers it, then that one will not ask for evidence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if one persists in forgetting, then evidence is not possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The kind of memory referred to here is the kind that one experiences when
</em><br>
one &quot;remembers oneself.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; as the brain comes to recognize and acknowledge the unity of reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it understands that control is an illusion.
</em><br>
<p>I can't quite parse all these statements together into a viewpoint, but they
<br>
do seem consistent and somehow all related together.  It almost sounds like
<br>
you think reality is one way and then people think about it too much and
<br>
talk themselves into a different viewpoint than reality would originally
<br>
indicate.  Is this part of your viewpoint?  Is this where your list of
<br>
useless hypothesis derive from, all the distracting theories that complicate
<br>
direct observation of reality?
<br>
<p>I know I am expending a lot of words to say I don't understand your post.  I
<br>
am not questioning or attacking your position.  It sounds interesting, but I
<br>
know that I have not grasped it.  I probably have missed previous relevant
<br>
posts, and am trying to understand a discussion in the middle.  I am trying
<br>
to catch up.
