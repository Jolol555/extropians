<em>&gt; ``The bottom line is that sometimes when people get a hunch, it's not

</em><br>
<em>&gt; University of New York at Stony Brook. ''It's because people are in a

</em><br>
<p>Bad interpretation! Bad interpretation! 
<br>
<p>The study showed that people that are good at noticing their visceral
<br>
signals are better at detecting conditioned aversion, not that this has
<br>
anything at all to do with the enteric nervous system. It is a nice
<br>
support for Damasio's somatic marker hypothesis for emotion, though.
<br>
Your subconscious emotional learned reactions affect the vagus nerve
<br>
(which innervates both the heart and the guts), and this creates a
<br>
somatic response you notice as a feeling. No need to have the gut learn
<br>
anything.
<br>
<p>That said, the enteric nervous system is pretty cool. It seems to have
<br>
some learning abilities and might even have limited pattern recognition
<br>
for different food types. It is crammed with transmittor substances (if
<br>
you can find a substance used there, then it is usually used in the
<br>
brain too) despite having a fairly simple worm-like layout. 
<br>
<p>When uploading, it might help to make the virtual body feel normal if
<br>
you upload the enteric system.
