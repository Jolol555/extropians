<p>Though I don't like the way you say it, you may be partially correct; 
<br>
however, the Latin American peasants you denounce also bring with them the 
<br>
willingness to do jobs that very few born Americans would want to do...and 
<br>
for less money.  Ask your average American if he or she would be willing to 
<br>
shovel a farm's worth of cow shit for a week for $200, and I think you know 
<br>
what the answer would be.  Ask your average Hispanic the same question, and 
<br>
many would jump at the opportunity.  The presence of Latin American 
<br>
immigrants is more of a benefit to the economy than a detriment as I see 
<br>
it; I could be wrong.  You may renounce their presence now, but if they 
<br>
were all to suddenly disappear, you will realize how much you have taken 
<br>
the work they do for granted.
<br>
<p>As to your contentions about their &quot;peasant culture&quot; and &quot;peasant 
<br>
brain[s],&quot; why should you care?  You don't have to be assimilated into that 
<br>
culture, any more than you have to be assimilated into the culture 
<br>
instilled by the Catholic church.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, regarding the immigration of educated software professionals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;i.e., HIB's, I myself work with many H1Bs, albeit often remotely via
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phone and email etc., so in some way, my own living derives from them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But I recognize that American citizens would take those jobs were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there no H1Bs.
</em><br>
<p>Is that so?  And if so, do you think that an American will always do a 
<br>
better job than an immigrant?  I had the misfortune of being born fifteen 
<br>
miles on the wrong side of the US/Canada border.  I didn't have the choice 
<br>
of being Canadian or American, and it is a question of geography as much as 
<br>
anything else that it is very difficult for me to attain permanent 
<br>
residency in perhaps the world's best country, USA.  I have abilities in a 
<br>
multitude of areas, but even now I have very few options open to me in the 
<br>
US due to my specific immigration status.  And I love this country.  As the 
<br>
COO of Kryos Biomedical and the Operations Officer etc. of Extropy 
<br>
Institute, I am most certainly not taking jobs away from Americans; one of 
<br>
the jobs was essentially not able to be filled by any American, and the 
<br>
other required a keen interest in an obscure area.
<br>
<p>Divorced from my obvious personal bias, I think it is a dangerous game to 
<br>
close the border(s) (which you may not be proposing), and it breeds both 
<br>
cultural arrogance (&quot;We can do it ourselves...we don't need those 
<br>
*outsiders*&quot;) and xenophobia.  To me, neither of those traits seem very 
<br>
favorable.
