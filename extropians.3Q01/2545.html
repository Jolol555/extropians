</em><br>
<p>You probably have in mind a &quot;solution&quot; in which
<br>
one day someone takes strong action and everyone
<br>
must agree to this action, or else!  Fortunately,
<br>
where there is great freedom and liberty, no one
<br>
can take such strong action.  (The fact that the
<br>
American Federal Government sometimes does send
<br>
soldiers to achieve any ends it desires within
<br>
the boundaries of the United States, despite the
<br>
overwhelming wishes of the people living in the
<br>
affected area, is a testimony to the fact that the
<br>
U.S. does not enjoy great freedom and liberty.)
<br>
<p>So, sorry.  All I could do would be to suggest 
<br>
weak, rather wimpish processes involving memes,
<br>
education, and evolution so long as the consti-
<br>
tution is being strictly adhered to (that is,
<br>
without people reading into it things that are
<br>
not literally there).

<p><em>&gt; #### You hit a sore point here - despite my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proclivity for free market based actions,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; of dealing with organized, localized, entrenched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pockets of arrogant nastiness - as in racist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communities, states, or countries.
</em><br>
<p>If people (e.g. black people) are systematically
<br>
being denied the right to vote in a discriminatory
<br>
way, the disenfranchisement could be or should be
<br>
against the Constitution of the United States.
<br>
But, for example, if strict literacy requirements
<br>
were, shall we say, being used to keep as many
<br>
poorly educated blacks as possible from voting,
<br>
this should not violate the constition so long
<br>
as the tests are administered fairly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For almost anything else I think the good way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the free market way but here I am stumped.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can somebody help? 
</em><br>
<p>If you're a strong ally of liberty, and you favor
<br>
everyone lawfully obeying the Constitution, then
<br>
you should be stumped, as I explained to Olga above.
<br>
<p>But if the entrenched nastiness is so severe that
<br>
life would be better elsewhere, my advice is to 
<br>
move.  In theory, I can imagine this.  For example,
<br>
let's suppose that you enjoy tobacco enormously,
<br>
and the denial of personal freedom in the U.S.
<br>
advances even further than it has.  Then you might
<br>
consider emigrating to Australia (do they let smokers
<br>
in?) or Ireland (do they let immigrants in at all?).
<br>
<p>Likewise, a black person suffering under Jim Crow
<br>
legislation in the U.S. south has to (a) become a
<br>
political activist to try to slowly get the laws
<br>
to change, (b) move to another state where discri-
<br>
mination is less, or (c) engage in a very risky
<br>
armed uprising (thereby becoming a traitor to the
<br>
United States), or (d) emigrating.  Sensitive black
<br>
people in the 1920's or 1950's, I would recommend,
<br>
would find (a) or (b) in their own best interest.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  Now if we just didn't have that pesky &quot;freedom&quot;
<br>
thing, the solution would be simple.  The government
<br>
merely gives an order &quot;It is against the law to treat
<br>
anyone differently on account of race (except for 
<br>
affirmative action)&quot;, and then simply arrest all
<br>
violators and send them to a labor camp in Alaska. 
<br>
Simple.  Effective.  Clean.  Appealing.  But also
<br>
extremely unfortunate, to put it mildly.
