<p><em>&gt; [But] there are different types of racists as well. Those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who think that someone needs to meet a lower standard just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of their skin color to get the same job or to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepted into college, or someone who thinks that someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who is 7 generations separated from their enslaved ancestors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deserves 'reparations', is themselves a racist:
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily.  I agree that this is *sometimes* the case,
<br>
but a person can realize that, statistically, black people are
<br>
often less qualified than, say, Asians, and &quot;deserve&quot; to have
<br>
a helping hand.  This person *need not* be a racist.  I.e.,
<br>
it's possible that they do not believe that the statistical
<br>
inferiority came about through inherent (in the strong sense
<br>
of inevitable) traits, but rather conditionally.  You and I
<br>
would agree that whatever human beings &quot;deserve&quot;, sometimes
<br>
it is and sometimes it is not what is best for them and for
<br>
everyone in the long run.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; they are assuming that the black person is inferior to the white person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that they are incapable of attaining the same level of achievement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the same standards of performance,
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  That is exactly what they are assuming.  Of course, I'm
<br>
sure that you know that they amplify on this to assert that the
<br>
causes of this incapacity are racism or poverty or whatever.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or that their life was somehow oppressed because their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great-great-great-great grandparent happened to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a slave (rather than, say, a serf).
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Their argument becomes very awkward at this point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These sentiments about affirmative action and reparations arise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the liberal white person from the same opinions (no matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how guiltily felt) about the inferiority of black people that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results from stereotypes and ignorance, feelings that blacks are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow less capable of achievement as individuals than whites.
</em><br>
<p>It all depends on how methodical those opinions are:  again, if
<br>
they believe that the inferiority is statistical in nature, such
<br>
as for example, the inferiority of my people (from western Nebraska,
<br>
as compared to urban Jews), and is traceable to historical conditions,
<br>
that's one thing.  But if they deeply and unconsciously fear that it's
<br>
much stronger and broader (i.e., they are racist) then that's another.
<br>
Now I better stop... and quickly exclaim that there are many liberals
<br>
who deny any differences whatsoever, statistical or not.  They live
<br>
in denial, and attribute *all* differences between *all* people
<br>
everywhere to discrimination and racist attitudes on others' parts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just as the KKK racist discriminates by hate and exclusion, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberal racist discriminates by guilt and coddling, and both do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a basis of skin color rather than the character of the individual.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Exactly so.  And they appear to have no idea of how
<br>
much harm they do to everyone---especially to the intended
<br>
beneficiaries of their discrimination.
