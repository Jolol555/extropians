<em>&gt; Externalities included (more-or-less), nuclear is easily the cheapest dense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy source available to us today.  Virtually all other energy sources are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more expensive per kWh, even without taking externalities into account.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only power source that could trump nuclear price-wise is geothermal (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries that have good geothermal possibilities), but there are some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logistical and inertial difficulties involved with that.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, wind power, given good siting, can deliver for 5 cents a kwh
<br>
or less (while nukes average about 9 cents/kwh or so). While each site
<br>
is intermittent (to varying degrees), enough sites of various
<br>
performance allows for a consistent low cost capacity. However, there is
<br>
a limit to how much wind we want (and the skyline issues as well are a
<br>
significant NIMBY factor) to exploit.
<br>
<p>Renewables, like nuclear, have huge up front capital costs with low
<br>
operating costs. Unlike nuclear, they don't have significant end of life
<br>
costs. The externalities of nuclear power has been artificially inflated
<br>
by the federal government's refusal to fulfill its commitment to have a
<br>
long term high level waste storage site built by 1980. Additionally,
<br>
concrete used in construction of nuclear plants has contained
<br>
radioactive fly ash, a waste product of coal power plants which is not
<br>
properly paid for by coal consumers, which results in nuclear power
<br>
consumers paying for the externalities of coal power plants. This is not
<br>
an issue when utilities own both types of plants, but does unfairly skew
<br>
the numbers agains nuclear. As a result of all these issues, nuclear
<br>
externalities have been approximately two to three times higher than
<br>
originally estimated when consumer surcharges on nuclear power were
<br>
instituted, but it is still the only power source that is required to
<br>
pay its externalities. If coal were required to do so, it would easily
<br>
be four times more expensive than it currently is, while oil and gas
<br>
would be twice as expensive as current prices.
