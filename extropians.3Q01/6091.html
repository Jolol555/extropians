<em>&gt; Interesting that the Empire State Building took a direct hit of an american
</em><br>
<em>&gt; air force bomber with a much more explosive fuel (aviation gas) than jet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fuel and  damage was minimal. Makes you wonder about building standards and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building permit enforcement today.
</em><br>
<p>John Young, an architect, gave this explanation on another mailing list:
<br>
<p>:The WTC towers had a distinctive structural system which utilized
<br>
:the exterior wall framing for lateral bracing -- a so-called lattice
<br>
:framework. This allowed minimization of internal lateral bracing
<br>
:and opened up the floor plans. You can see the effect of that when
<br>
:the buildings collapsed, with the lattice framework crumbling and
<br>
:the interior imploding. The lattice works so long as it remains
<br>
:intact as a system: if a part of it goes, then the whole system
<br>
:goes.
<br>
:
<br>
:The planes punched holes in the lattice, one tower punched
<br>
:on two sides, maybe the other too. Portions of the lattice of
<br>
:the second tower briefly remained standing after the collapse,
<br>
:then fell.
<br>
:
<br>
:The system was considered daring at the time of construction, for
<br>
:it distributed loads more efficiently than legacy column-and-beam-
<br>
:supported systems. Probably the legacy systems would not have
<br>
:totally collapsed due to damage at upper floors, although floors
<br>
:above the damage would have come down if columns were
<br>
:weakened.
