<p>MAD will serve us well, until it fails.  We might have the UIM by then,
<br>
but we might not.
<br>
<p>What I have not seen is some kind of timeline that shows the intermediate
<br>
steps that need to be accomplished before the UIM is born.  Any major
<br>
project has something like this, but Ive not seen one for AI.  Does such
<br>
a thing exist?  Are there milestones we should be looking for?  spike
