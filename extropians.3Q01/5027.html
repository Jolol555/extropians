</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Depends on the state. The US was a collection of 13 independent states.
<br>
Vermont, for example, had outlawed slavery from the very beginning in
<br>
the 1780's.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Christianity had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; put a severe dent in slavery in Europe a long time before, with serfdom
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www2.prestel.co.uk/littleton/jmslaver.htm">http://www2.prestel.co.uk/littleton/jmslaver.htm</a> (admittedly part
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; was responsible for the decline of slavery in Europe.  My summary:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic and military conditions such as the decline of Rome and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Turks closing off slave markets to Italian traders caused the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decline of slavery in Europe; Christian officials were silent on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the matter or apologists for slavery until well after its decline;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the African slave trade was operated by and praised by Christians;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deists and rationalists initiated anti-slavery sentiments in western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europe and America.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but deism and rationalists of the enlightenment were more
<br>
influenced by christianity than any other source, including philosophers
<br>
like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, etc. and most of them did, in fact,
<br>
consider themselves to be christian men, regardless  of whether modern
<br>
day 'Christians' would consider the policies they espoused to be such.
