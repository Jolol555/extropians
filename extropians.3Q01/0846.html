Hal &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Kosko%20on%20AI%20in%20L.A.%20Times&In-Reply-To=&lt;200107111728.LAA07041@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">hal@finney.org</a>&gt; reported on Kosko's article in the L.A. Times:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Chip minds will have a bit-based omnipotence because they could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   create entire virtual worlds simply by imagining them. Let's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   forget that the world we see &quot;out there&quot; is but an illusion in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   neural circuitry of our brain's visual cortex.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arggg!  Why do so many smart people talk in such ambiguous
<br>
meaningless terms?  Of course Dennett, who claims we have no qualia -
<br>
it just &quot;seems like we do&quot;, would take an ambiguous and meaningless
<br>
statements like this as indicating that the &quot;out there&quot; we think
<br>
exists doesn't really exist.  But a representationalists, like myself,
<br>
would take this ambiguous statement as meaning our knowledge of what
<br>
is out there does really exist, as something constructed out of qualia
<br>
in our brain, the &quot;illusion&quot; being simply that our perception that
<br>
this conscious knowledge appears to be &quot;out there&quot; when in reality it
<br>
is simply in our brain.  Why can't he say one way or another, which of
<br>
these interpretations he is talking about, or if by this he means
<br>
something entirely different from either of these views.  How can
<br>
anyone be expected to make any kind of rational sense out of such
<br>
meaningless and ambiguous statements?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Even our subjective sense of time will change. We find the second a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   meaningful unit of time because electrical signals travel so slowly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   through our nerves. Chip time, or &quot;nanotime,&quot; will be millions or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   billions of times faster. One second of brain time will equal years
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   or even decades of chip time.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me he is making a categorical and ambiguous error
<br>
here also.  He is confusing two drastically different things and
<br>
ambiguously talking about them as if they were the same thing.  There
<br>
is a big categorical difference between how fast our brain hardware
<br>
can operate and how our brain represents the conscious perception of
<br>
time passage.  Sure, given faster conscious phenomenal hardware, it
<br>
might be possible to change our representations of the passage of time
<br>
such that the qualia that once represented one second, can now be used
<br>
to represents a nanosecond...  But again, conscious representations of
<br>
time, and what it is phenomenally or consciously like are very
<br>
different things than how fast you can switch a switch for which it
<br>
doesn't matter what the switch is &quot;like&quot; or what it is fundamentally
<br>
composed of.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's no wonder we haven't really discovered what consciousness
<br>
is yet.  Even though it's obviously just right there, we're still just
<br>
so &quot;unclear on the concept&quot; that we can't even talk about it in any
<br>
kind of meaningful and unambiguous way.
<br>
