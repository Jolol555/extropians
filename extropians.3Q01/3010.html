<p><em>&gt; We don't have list rules against uncomfortable subjects.  We do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have list rules against ad hominem.  Stating that blacks cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve as well as whites is ad hominem.  It attacks the person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as invalid rather than discussing any person's actions, topics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories, actions, statements, etc.  It was persuasive rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than objective.
</em><br>
<p>Making a *statistical* statement concerning the ability of 
<br>
different groups is not an ad hominem attack against anyone,
<br>
in my opinion.  Facts, no matter how unpleasant, should not
<br>
in any way be proscribed from a discussion list:  the intent
<br>
of the rule that you refer to, is to warn off one poster 
<br>
from making a *personal* attack against another.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If someone had attacked a particular list member by claiming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [his or her] race was inferior instead of attacking their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific actions, statements or claims, this would violate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the list rules.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  It would be as if I were to attempt to rebut your
<br>
arguments by making some allusion to your I.Q., or to 
<br>
your weight (gee, Harvey, hope you're not overweight :-),
<br>
or your nationality.  Even though these might be factual,
<br>
they should violate any list's rules.  But to make some
<br>
claim, for example, that &quot;Californian Asian children are
<br>
as much smarter, statistically, than white children as
<br>
white children are smarter than black children&quot;, is
<br>
neither ad hominem nor against list rules.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My analysis was objective, precise and complete.
</em><br>
<p>Well, :-), that remains to be determined.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Now I notice, for the first time that I can recall, statements
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; such as these being made without any quoting of the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sources.  This is very peculiar.  I think the explanation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that the original source (Fred Reed's essay) is heavy on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; innuendo and implication, and doesn't so easily yield up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; quotable examples.  But this just makes discussing it only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; more difficult, not impossible.  If we are to find the truth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; then such effort must be undertaken.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; However, for the sake of completeness of the record, let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me clearly quote exact passages from the article:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; owe me for three bicycles. Maybe it's a small thing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I'm tired of losing bicycles.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;feemelkeebome&quot; is stretching it. The errors were of this sort.[...]
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Without thinking, I asked, &quot;What color is your teacher?&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I can yell at an ignorant white teacher, but not at a black one.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; To expect blacks to meet standards is racist.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; People in, say, Switzerland can walk their streets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after dark.  We can't.  Why?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; - they never caught the killers, but - what you reckon, Johnny?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   [were they old white people]?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; [White people invented positron-emission scanners... Air-conditioning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Roads. Writing. The wheel. Complicated stuff like that.  Medicine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tractors. Shoes. Houses.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd love to see blacks study, earn degrees on their merits, prosper.
</em><br>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt; These statements make these racist assumptions (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order of the above quotes):
</em><br>
---------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt; - unseen bicycle thieves are assumed to be black
</em><br>
<p>Yes!  (Then again, it's *possible* that Fred Reed was living at the
<br>
time in an area where the odds were overwhelming.  But still...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - poor teachers are assumed to probably be black
</em><br>
Yes.  But as I wrote before, there isn't anything necessarily
<br>
racist about this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - countries without crime problems are assumed to be so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   because of a lack of blacks
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  That is racist.  Any such statement would have to be
<br>
enormously qualified not to be racist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - unsolved murders are assumed to be committed by blacks
</em><br>
Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - all technology inventions are assumed to be made by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   whites and not blacks
</em><br>
<p>No.  That the vast majority of inventions did not occur in
<br>
tropical regions is factual.  If Fred Reed implied &quot;all&quot;, then 
<br>
I think that his point has to be understood in the context of
<br>
the claim that he was making about the wisdom of reparations.
<br>
It has to be so understood, that is, if we wish to always use
<br>
the principle of charity, and read unclear passages in their
<br>
best light.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - all [of] western civilization [is] assumed to be due
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   to whites and not blacks
</em><br>
<p>See preceding comment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - all value in Microsoft Word is assumed to be due to Microsoft's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   white employees and none of their black employees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - basic tools such as roads, writing, the wheel, shoes, houses
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   are assumed to have been invented by whites but not blacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - the wheel is assumed to have been invented by a white and not a black
</em><br>
<p>No comment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - blacks are assumed to be incapable of study
</em><br>
<p>Here is what Fred Reed wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't wish stick houses on anyone. I'm glad you have the benefits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electricity, clothes, and daytime TV. I'd love to see blacks study, earn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degrees on their merits, prosper.
</em><br>
<p>See?  He did not at all imply that they were incapable of study.
<br>
The worst that can be read into the paragraph is the assertion
<br>
that they do not in fact study.  This would be silly and racist,
<br>
if taken literally.  But if the implication is that black people
<br>
study less than whites, and too seldom at that, this is probably
<br>
true.
<br>
<p>Now I am *not* defending Fred's statements here: I am holding
<br>
up to criticism Harvey Newstrom's assertions about some of these
<br>
statements, namely, that they contained racist assumptions.\
<br>
To continue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - degrees earned by blacks are assumed to be given without merit
</em><br>
<p>No.  The implication is that too often, or sometimes, degrees
<br>
have been obtained by blacks without merit, or at least more
<br>
often than is the case with non-blacks.  This is probably true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - blacks are assumed to be unable to prosper
</em><br>
<p>No.  You are stretching here.
<br>
<p>Let me thank you again, Harvey, for having made so much that was
<br>
implicit and difficult, explicit and easy to see.  At least three
<br>
times above, I gave an unqualified &quot;yes&quot;.  You could have restrained
<br>
yourself to making your best case; as Russell said, you were a bit
<br>
too elaborate.  I know, once you get rolling, it's difficult not
<br>
to pile on---I've done it myself, and only weakened my point as
<br>
as consequence.
<br>
<p>Jerry had written (not me)
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Well I grant you the post didn't contain anything on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; order of: &quot;All niggers are shiftless, lazy, criminals who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; have made no worthwhile contribution to society&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; But it did say this!  A point-by-point analysis of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement above shows that the article did exactly claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything you said.  It called them blacks for &quot;niggers&quot;...
</em><br>
<p>Jerry's statement is factually true.  Yours is a polemical
<br>
exaggeration.  It *is* possible to not write like that.
<br>
(I do thank some readers who have caught me doing it, on
<br>
occasion.)
<br>
<p>To summarize, citing only Harvey's *valid* assertions
<br>
about some claims in Fred Reed's piece being founded
<br>
on racist assumptions:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- unseen bicycle thieves are assumed to be black
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- countries without crime problems are assumed to be so
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of a lack of blacks
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- unsolved murders are assumed to be committed by blacks
<br>
<p>All indeed do seem to be present in the piece and racist
<br>
(to me).  Harvey's other assertions were highly questionable,
<br>
and often untrue.  But again, thanks for the elucidation.
<br>
<p>Lee
