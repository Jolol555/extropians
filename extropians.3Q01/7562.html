</em><br>
<p>Jonas, I don't think the discussion is too much off the mark.
<br>
There has been a tragedy prompted by slanted religious memes.
<br>
This has been an unextropic event of major proportions that
<br>
seems likely to seriously impact the future path of humanity.
<br>
How we deal with this event may play a critical role in how
<br>
we may have to deal with future events using more advanced
<br>
WMD involving bioterrorism or nanoterrorism.
<br>
<p>Most of the discussion on how to prevent future occurences like
<br>
this and how to combat specific problems has been pretty good.
<br>
<p>However, the suggestion under discussion in this thread needs
<br>
a reality check.
<br>
<p>What was the population of Berlin during the airlift?
<br>
A few million?  What is the population of Afghanistan?
<br>
28 million.  That looks something like 28000 *tons* of
<br>
food per day.  The payload capacity of a C5 is ~92 tons
<br>
and the C17 is even less at 77 tons.  So you are talking about
<br>
something like 300+ air missions per day.  The British SkyCat
<br>
1000 (dirigible) could handle 1000 tons per mission but it is slower.
<br>
You also have a problem of distributing the food to the various
<br>
population centers that might require more missions.
<br>
<p>I can't easily come up with numbers of how many C5's the U.S.
<br>
has but I suspect it isn't enough to supply the amount of
<br>
food required.  The right way to do this is via a truck
<br>
convoy with the obvious problem that you will need to
<br>
control the roads over which the trucks travel.
<br>
