<p>Your post mirrors my concerns to a large extent. There was a time
<br>
when I did my best to challenge bad thinking and pseudoscience on
<br>
this list and the swedish transhumanist list. But the problem is that
<br>
no matter how much time and personal energy you have, they will run
<br>
out when dealing with the true believers and the people who believe
<br>
in posting stuff about government UFO-coverups just &quot;because it is
<br>
fun&quot;. So now I try to stay away from that, using my precious time on
<br>
other projects where I think it will do more good. But it is a
<br>
lose-lose scenario, because not doing anything about the posts will
<br>
fill the searchable, web-indexed archives with junk that *will* (and
<br>
to some extent already does) haunt our public image. 
<br>
<p>The problem of how much time one should spend on checking facts and
<br>
assumptions, and how wild world models one allow oneself, has no
<br>
easily answerable solution (I actually think it is uncomputable). At
<br>
the same time we all need to come up with our own individual answers,
<br>
and we have a right to choose how strict our epistemologies are. In
<br>
the long run we all by having a spread in the population of answers
<br>
to this problem - while some people waste time on wild speculations,
<br>
they sometimes come up with good ideas, and while others keep their
<br>
reality models so strict and simple that they sometimes ignore new
<br>
ideas they make sure they do not fall for false ideas.
<br>
<p>The same could be said for discussion forums. Some are strict, some
<br>
are very loose. The question is what level to put this particular
<br>
forum on; what do we see as the purpose of the extropians list, and
<br>
how much do we value false positives vs. false negative errors in our
<br>
thinking?
<br>
<p>I would say the extropians list is intended to further the
<br>
development of extropianism - not transhumanism in general, but this
<br>
particular brand. Also, since extropianism is a practical philosophy
<br>
oriented towards actually achieving its goals rather than just
<br>
discussing them this means the list should be a tool for implementing
<br>
extropy in the real world. Debate and speculation have their places
<br>
here, but in the end they all should lead towards (or at least not
<br>
counteract) the actual creation of an extropian future. 
<br>
<p>Since we take an empirical and pan-critical approach (or at least
<br>
something like it, for you doubters out there) we should keep the
<br>
discussions here at the level which in the past most efficiently have
<br>
led towards the realisation of our goals. To me (and this is of
<br>
course a very debatable point where empirical evidence would be
<br>
welcome) the period when extropian thinking advanced most efficiently
<br>
was during the early time when the list was fairly homogeneous and
<br>
well educated about the basics. Homogenity itself is no virtue, but
<br>
having a forum where some basics are widely agreed on (and probed for
<br>
further improvements) combined with less overhead due to constant
<br>
clashes is very likely far more efficient than the current situation.
<br>
Achieving such a state would require a stricter moderation/membership
<br>
policy, losing diversity and introducing a higher risk for
<br>
group-think. Clearly such problems have to be balanced by the
<br>
benefits (how?).
<br>
<p>As for pseudoscience and loose thinking, maybe one way handling it
<br>
would be to set up an epistemic policy on the list. Such a policy
<br>
would suggest proper standards for what claims could be posted and
<br>
how much empirical or scholarly backup is proper. For example,
<br>
&quot;Posting of claims contradicting known or widely accepted physical
<br>
phenomena must be backed up by at least one independent empirical
<br>
study&quot;. While I do not think such an epistemic policy needs to
<br>
involve punishments for disobeying it, the existence of an accepted
<br>
standard of posting that could be invoked when someone makes a
<br>
spurious claim would likely have some effect. Setting up the policy
<br>
would by its nature be a fairly heated subject, but maybe it could be
<br>
managed by first allowing a smaller team to develop the core and then
<br>
put it up for a debate, like we did with the Transhumanist
<br>
Declaration.
