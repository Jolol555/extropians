<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reviews by the predictably leftie movie reviewers all hated the fact

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Some did.  Others just disliked the fact that all real humans were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; depicted as universally inhumane, regardless of the humanity of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; mechas - and portraying any such trait as common to every single human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; does, IMO, reasonably violate &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; in most cases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So I suppose Nazi Germany is just too evil to be believed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Godwin's Law.  ;P
</em><br>
<p>;P blah blah blah. Since the issue of luddite versus artificial person
<br>
is the same issue, I'm not sure if this applies...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. As I've heard it, most Germans at the time were treating Jews as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second-class citizens, but not as objects to be completely disposed of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like so much diseased cattle.  Only a small minority inside Germany
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knew of the Final Solution, at least until after the war when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Allies informed the rest.  This is consistent with my observations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people in my own life.
</em><br>
<p>Only a small minority were found to have sufficient documentation that
<br>
they knew. You'd have to be a raving idiot to live within a few miles of
<br>
the ovens to NOT know what was going on. The fact is that Jews who were
<br>
found to be carrying contraband (false ID, firearms, foreign money, etc)
<br>
were not arrested, they were shot. Additionally, there are now proven
<br>
cases (like the recently discovered situation in Poland) where the
<br>
civilian population rounded up the Jews and killed them, later claiming
<br>
the Nazis did it.
<br>
<p>Jews had always been second class citizens prior to the Nazis. For
<br>
example, generations earlier, when the first German censuses were done
<br>
that  included the Jews, they were given German surnames made up by
<br>
census counters, frequently of rather disparaging nature (i.e. Einhorn,
<br>
'one horn' which is a reference to the penis). It was only under the
<br>
Nazis that they were actually treated as cattle, with brands (the yellow
<br>
star of david patch on all clothing), stripped of property, and herded
<br>
into cattle cars in public.
