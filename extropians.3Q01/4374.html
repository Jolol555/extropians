<p>Are you sure about this? Wouldn't assigning different rights to men and

women violate the Equal Protection Clause?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not according to US law, where otherwise lawful acts, dependent upon unlawful

</em><br>
<p>Are you saying that illegal clones would not have the right to clone
<br>
themselves? Why not, since it wasn't their fault that they were illegally
<br>
cloned. By applying this logic, people who are conceived as a result of
<br>
rape would not be allowed to procreate.

<p><em>&gt; By that time the evolutionary phase transition will have rendered organic

<p>Maybe, but you will still have similar problems with other people stealing
<br>
your design specs and building clones of you without your consent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I wonder if we might see anti-cloning technology that actually would work.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such technology already exists. It's called abortion.
</em><br>
<p>How is abortion going to protect you from being cloned? Are you going to
<br>
go around testing every fetus and abort those that are your clones?
