<p>
To all:
<br>
<p>PLEASE TONE DOWN THE RHETORIC!
<br>
<p>So it is clear, my personal opinion, while still obviously in its formative
<br>
stages, supports the use of force by the U.S. (and its allies, if they &quot;have
<br>
the stomach for it&quot;).  I will likely post my evolving &quot;war plan&quot; at some
<br>
point soon, but only if it can be discussed in rational, courteous terms.
<br>
<p>In the meantime, to folks who aren't in the U.S. or who counsel not taking
<br>
action with military force, please understand that what has happened here
<br>
has triggered a wave of emotion in this country unprecedented in 59 years.
<br>
Arguably, the response is greater than what happened after Pearl Harbor (I
<br>
sorely miss my father, with whom I would so love to discuss the comparison).
<br>
I appreciate that those who support a less violent reaction have been
<br>
sensitive to this, and I hope that you will continue to be so.
<br>
<p>To those who have been beating the war drum, PLEASE calm down.  I have been
<br>
venting similar sentiments with my very close friends in a more private and
<br>
emotionally intimate forum.  May I suggest that you do the same?  It is a
<br>
perfectly natural thing for us male hominids to gather with our hunting
<br>
party around the fire to thump our chests and revel in talk of revenge.  By
<br>
all means do it, but please not at THIS hearth.  It is emotionally unhealthy
<br>
to not express these feelings, but I ask for restraint in this forum.
<br>
