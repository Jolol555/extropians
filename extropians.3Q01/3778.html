<p>While most of your statements here are very laudable, Joe, your last
<br>
displays an apples and oranges analogy.
<br>
<p>While there is no connection between having a gun rack in your pickup
<br>
truck and being a racist (there are plenty of people with gun racks who
<br>
are not), advocating a specific, authoritarian-leaning political policy
<br>
is totally different from owning an item like a gun rack.
<br>
<p>Your phrase about 'folks who wish reasonable restrictions' would only be
<br>
consistent if you said something like: &quot;kinda like considering all
<br>
southerners who advocate segregation to be racists or all folks who wish
<br>
reasonable restrictions placed on gun ownership to be commie pinkoes.&quot;
