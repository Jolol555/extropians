<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;You DO NOT have the right to take other peoples property (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;have the government take it for you). You must rely on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;voluntary contributions and charity if you want to be moral.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However do you get around? It must be rather limiting, restricting your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; routes to avoid any roads paid for by taxes. Or do you drive along (or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the bus or train) in a state of crushing and unremitting guilt?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Guilt??  He's talking about the politicians and the voters
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who took the money.  Annoyance, or perhaps the feeling of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being abused, is probably what he feels when using the roads.
</em><br>
<p>Nozick has an interesting essay on this somewhere in his _Philosophical 
<br>
Explanations_.
<br>
<p>Personally, I don't make a good libertarian because I can see no principled 
<br>
way to restrict government activities in the field of building social 
<br>
infrastructure like roads, public schools, etc, and collecting taxes to pay 
<br>
for it. This is not an argument for big government, which can be opposed on 
<br>
various bases, just a view that there is no knock-out argument in favour of 
<br>
minarchy. I think it can be shown that any pure minarchist position such as 
<br>
Jerry Mitchell seems to be advocating collapses into either anarchism or 
<br>
classical liberalism, once a serious attempt is made to defend it.
<br>
<p>I do think there is something damn close to a knock-out argument against 
<br>
passing laws based on the reasoning that &quot;we don't want you to exercise your 
<br>
freedom in certain ways that we find immoral&quot;. That, however, is a classical 
<br>
liberal view, not strictly a libertarian one.
<br>
<p>Cheers
