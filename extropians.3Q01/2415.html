<p><em>&gt; &gt; just human nature), is there any good reason not to attempt to found and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nurture a purposeful religion? By this I mean one dedicated to -- for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; example -- either building or funding the building of God/a god
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (== true AI)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or achieving immortality. (Both very Gnostic goals, but Gnosticism had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nice long run of things).
</em><br>
<p>[snip]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It allows for tapping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into a wellspring of human motivation;

<em>&gt; promise(/suggest/hypothesise) later
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; happiness/other benefit in exchange for resouces now. A number of

<p><em>&gt; I have thought about this many times.  It might even be possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to organize such an endeavor so that the normal tithes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributions are used directly to fund projects making for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precisely the sort of future and results that the religion had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as, or as necessary to its goal states.  The adherents to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion could be workers, beneficiaries and share-holders in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common of these projects.
</em><br>
<p>In theory, that was what many orders of monks approached back in the day.
<br>
Economic communes with a stated (if somewhat fuzzy) purpose, turning out
<br>
products that would supposedly aid that purpose.
<br>
<p>[church of the immaculate data haven snipped]
<br>
<p>Not a bad idea for an end run around the current less than optimal legal
<br>
threats.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A religion based strongly in actual scientific and technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tools for making many of the promises and deep desires of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity actualities could pull a lot of the best from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traditional religions and also give an overhaul vision and since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of purpose to many techies out there who are relatively cynical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and are missing such a unifying image of what their work is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about and leads to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A lot of fun and some quite serious good could well come out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soemthing like this.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed. So why don't you try? Write the principia, build a website,
<br>
publicize a bit at a time. Invoke the Great God of Viral Meme Propagation. A
<br>
Church of Open Source would probably do pretty well right now in the current
<br>
atmosphere of cold war -- you strengthen by opposing, as MS is finding out.
<br>

<br>
<p>Larry Wall speaks so carefully and so directly in the interview that I found
<br>
it entertaining just to listen to Wall have a conversation with two people
<br>
whom are basically Open Source ignorant.
<br>
Several times he is asked to respond to strange and/or cliched metaphors
<br>
about Open Source (primitive tribe, priesthood) and himself (Prometheus,
<br>
&quot;man behind the curtain&quot;, Wizard) that put him at a loss for words -- as if
<br>
they're tempting him into admitting &quot;Yes! okay I'm just a cult leader and
<br>
these are my dutiful minions&quot; -- and he points out that what they think is
<br>
counterintuitive (why give stuff away free? why let people read your code?
<br>
how is there convergence in what seems to be a committee... aren't
<br>
committees prone to dissent?) maybe isn't so counterintuitive...
<br>
<p>And the interviewers start to understand the philosophical differences
<br>
between closed source and open source. They really picked up on the
<br>
significance of asking &quot;Why not?&quot;. He really blows their minds with some
<br>
deep thoughts about the importance of sharing software ideas.
<br>
<p>I think that the general message they get is that Open Source isn't a
<br>
business model, it's at least an ethic, and might even be a religion.
<br>
<p>So, ./ers, if your Open Source faith is waning, or you're looking for
<br>
someone to convince you that Open Source is in fact the path of the
<br>
righteous, then hear the preaching of the Reverend Larry Wall of the Church
<br>
of Open Source... and be amazed.
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>...but not much else. The field is primed and wide open.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is now a bit harder to establish a religion legally.  The IRS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has some pretty finicky guidelines on what they consider to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;legitimate&quot; religion.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure we can all guess at where the blame lies for that.
