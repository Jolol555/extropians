<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; What I didn't mention was the years in the early 19th century when
</em><br>
there
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was &gt; &gt; &gt; both public AND private education equally available in the
</em><br>
U.S.
<br>
<p>Olga:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You also forgot to mention that (during the time you depict) it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *illegal* for some people in the U.S. to even learn to read.
</em><br>
&nbsp;Mike:
<br>
<em>&gt; Just what the HELL does that have to do with it?
</em><br>
<p>If you've ever played any children's games, you know there are Rules of the
<br>
Game.  I propose that one cannot win the game of &quot;Education Checkers&quot; by
<br>
ignoring all the other pieces on the board (poor people, women, slaves,
<br>
etc.).
<br>
<p>Sounds like one more
<br>
<em>&gt; case of the whiny liberal resorting to a last ditch attempt at labelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her opponents racist to escape a losing position.
</em><br>
<p>Because you cannot stealthily whisk a few pesky checker pieces out of sight
<br>
in order to win the game, it is you who hold the losing position - on the
<br>
grounds of cheating.  And just to show you how *ultra*liberal I can be:  I
<br>
won't even subtract any extra points from you for your tired use of the
<br>
phrase &quot;whiny liberal.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or are YOU implying that the descendants of those who were prohibited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from learning to read are inherently less able to be educated today????
</em><br>
<p>I have no idea what you mean, or how I may have implied this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That sounds like a pretty racist opinion to me.
</em><br>
<p>I thought you were asking me a question?  Thanks for your kindness in
<br>
providing a ready-made explanation for me, but I'm still not giving you a
<br>
free pass to cheat at checkers.
<br>
<p>Olga
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; So tell me again how public education and the government helped the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; poor people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Gladly.  Public education does not sanction discrimination based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; religion, ethnicity, class, and what have you (that is to say, it has
</em><br>
truly
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; become more democratic lately - if only in the last few decades - and,
</em><br>
in my
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; view, the bulk of good it does by this very fact alone puts it ahead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; private education).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Private education cannot discriminate thus (except for religion) either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many private schools offer scholarships to gifted poor kids to attend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their schools. There is this thing, see, called financial aid.... I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggest you get rid of the ComIntern originated memes against private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizations that seem to be embedded in you.
