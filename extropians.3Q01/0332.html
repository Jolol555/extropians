<p>Hmm. Funny, though, how even the incredibly intelligent seem unable to
<br>
follow the simple logic beyond the current parlous transitional situation. 
<br>
<p>*Nobody* wants to live to 120 if that means 40 years as a vegetable, or
<br>
slow physical and mental decay. The goal of life extension is *drastic
<br>
cellular repair and maintenance*, in the first instance, and *enhancement*
<br>
as a likely next step from there.
<br>
<p>It's like moaning, `Oh, what's the point of being cryonically preserved
<br>
after death? You'll never be able to move or talk again, all frozen stiff
<br>
like that!' Biostasis is intended a temporary condition, obviously. And
<br>
current life extension methods, primitive as they are, should be regarded
<br>
as a way to hang on (`like grim death', as they say) until genomics,
<br>
proteomics and/or nanotech yield methods for (1) stalling and then
<br>
repairing existing damage, and (2) maintaining [regained] youthful health
<br>
perpetually, or until a better option comes along (such as, for example,
<br>
uploading into a more fluent body or life-space).
<br>
<p>The fear of Tithonus, who in myth grew ever older and more feeble, to his
<br>
terrified despair, is a rudimentary failure of imagination. We'll get past
<br>
it, just as we got over the fear of Icarus.
