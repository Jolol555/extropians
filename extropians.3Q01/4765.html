<p><em>&gt; Humans are responsible for themselves, and even if others dislike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their choices they have a right to make them as long as their freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't interfere with the freedom of others.  This tends to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional when it comes to originating children, but the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments that make it ethical within this framework to genetically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modify children also allows parents who have notable genetic flaws to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pass them on - it might be bad, but forbidding it or imposing force to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent it is far worse. 
</em><br>
<p>Quite so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Suppose that a small community has on its hands someone who can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or won't support himself, and lies about on main street annoying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the productive citizens who pass by (who find that they must feed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; him to keep him alive, and wear earmuffs to keep his insane shouting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from driving them nuts).  Now [should] this small community have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; [legal] right to to seize this person, hospitalize him, and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sterilize him?  As a member of a small, rather isolated community
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; typical of many in the history books, I would cautiously endorse such actions.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the only case where this might be ethically acceptable from my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position would be if ... he was not acting as an autonomous person any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more and the treatment would restore his autonomy.  Sure, drawing lines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here is notoriously tricky, but it is possible to do. Forcing autonomous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persons that do not infringe on the rights of others is a very bad thing to do. 
</em><br>
<p>In our current, complex societies, I agree.  But I guess we disagree on some
<br>
real cases that have come up historically, and possibly will come up again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Well, this is a huge *IF*, but *if* I had a real nation, and cared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about whether it itself prospered and thrived in a competitive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world, then the only immigrants that I'd allow were those of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same cultural background as my own people, and who would seemlessly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fit in, without fracturing the society into different groups.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, you do that. I, the benevolent ruler of the neighbouring nation will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow your tired, poor huddled masses to immingrate freely. OK, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to be messy, but which nation do you think will be richest and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most dynamic 300 years after its funding? 
</em><br>
<p>Just because the U.S. has gotten away with this over the last 250
<br>
years doesn't mean it's universally practical.  The U.S. had no
<br>
powerful neighbors, and came into being just before the first time
<br>
in history it was possible for typical families to feed and clothe
<br>
ten kids apiece.  If France, say, had taken up your suggestion in
<br>
1500, France would have soon ceased to exist.  It would have turned
<br>
into another Poland or Yugoslavia or worse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why do you think IQ would help societies?  Remember that it is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weakly correlated to anything useful.
</em><br>
<p>I think that IQ is *very* useful.  To quote an example given by the
<br>
hated and heretical &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, consider a busboy.  An intelligent
<br>
busboy will be more efficient in the restaurant than one who is dull,
<br>
because the intelligent one will make fewer unnecessary trips to the
<br>
kitchen and in other ways simply organize his work better.  There
<br>
really are only a few tasks where intelligence does not add efficiency,
<br>
and the more advanced a society is, the truer this becomes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All in all, I think the IQ issue is pretty irrelevant here. What really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters in the current thread is the ethics of forcing vs. supporting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change in reproduction for some global goal. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it's very hard to think of any historical situation in which 
<br>
forcing a change in the way people reproduce would be productive.
<br>
One can even go back to ancient Sparta in its contest with Athens
<br>
to see the disadvantages.  I confess, however, that if I had been
<br>
an Athenian, what the Spartans were up to would have scared me to
<br>
death; just as I used to really worry that the Soviets were going
<br>
to win the cold war because of their greater focus and uniformity.
