<p>To cherry-pick a little, what of, say, medical treatments for various

projected future tech (namely, understanding the software of the human

</em><br>
<p>I never said this would be soon.  Plus, I'm trying to explain the

thought chain; I don't necessarily fully agree with it (though I do to
<br>
some extent).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;   * I believe that they are aware of this oncoming time, therefore I

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then go ahead and back it up.
</em><br>
<p>How much proof do you want?  Let's start with this from
<br>
<a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2001/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20010623_ucraina-meeting_en.html">http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2001/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20010623_ucraina-meeting_en.html</a>
<br>
to see what is regarded as the most important thing in a certain high
<br>
religious officer's opinion for scientists to keep in mind:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And in a special way for you, men and women engaged in scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;research, may the fearful social, economic and ecological catastrophe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Chernobyl serve as a permanent warning!  The potential of technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must be wedded to unchanging ethical values, if the respect due to man
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and his inalienable dignity is to be guaranteed.
</em><br>
<p>Unchanging ethics, even if the basis for prior ethical constructs is
<br>
found wanting?  (&quot;Slavery was just fine in the 1600s, so it's ok now.&quot;)
<br>
Note that the ethical values that lead to Chernobyl (putting a very low
<br>
priority on potential high risks) were, themselves, found lacking.  Or
<br>
is the message that scientists should always live in fear of the
<br>
potential of their own work (as opposed to, say, acknowledging and
<br>
dealing with it)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; * Among the options that have occurred to me to resolve this problem,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   the most appealing is to hasten the demise of these religions through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   making people no longer believe them, thus largely negating the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   religious powers' influence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If religion was your primary worry this might make sense.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't.  The established state and economic powers are the one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who will notice the potential threat and act first and most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively.  Your energy is misdirected.   Some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious focus and sentiment can actually be turned to the aid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of most of our causes with a bit of imagination.  Come out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trumpeting that you will destroy all religion though and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will probably be squashed quite quickly.  Your more powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemies will help quite happily while making it look as if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; came from the religious.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;shrugs&gt;  Here, I definitely disagree with the thought chain I posted.
<br>
(I probably made a mistake in phrasing the thought chain from the first
<br>
person.)  However, each worry
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; ...which leads to the debate as to how to do such a thing.  Personally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; my own thought chain offers a different solution: hasten debunking via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology, both by exploring how exactly this happens (a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understanding of science can already offer much immunity from religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; memes) and by getting the relevant advanced technolgies into many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have a good understanding of science.  Believe me, it is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a effective an antidote.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I've found that it is, at least the ones people have tried to
<br>
indoctrinate me with.  Then again, maybe that's because the
<br>
indoctrinations have usually required belief in what I had previously
<br>
learned was absurd and easily disproved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; peoples' hands (thus making it easier to obtain said good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understanding, through frequent interaction with demonstrations of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; principles - for instance, experiencing memories copied into one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brain by purely physical processes, which would not be possible if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;soul&quot; which contained such was purely nonphysical).  A person can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who says?  This would actually demonstrate very little.  And of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course we can't do this today.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;shrugs&gt;  Ok, I'm guilty of stretching for an example there.  Possibly
<br>
a better one: demonstration that machines can do physical labor on
<br>
behalf of people, through lots of people having cars and/or riding
<br>
trains, buses, et cetera.  Or a demonstration that the &quot;natural&quot; body
<br>
is not the best possible host for our minds: prosthetics that do better
<br>
than natural equivalents (which we have, but only for certain broken
<br>
natural parts, though this covers both broken-by-use, arguably
<br>
artificial, and broken-at-birth, unarguably natural).
