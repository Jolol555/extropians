<p><em>&gt;As a side note, how many on this list are emotionally devastated by this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attack?  I know I am.  I was last in the WTC on September 2nd.  I spent
</em><br>
most
<br>
<em>&gt;of yesterday in a state of utter disbelief and shock -- though happily I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accounted for all my friends and loved ones who lived or worked in the
</em><br>
area.
<br>
<p>It seems like more than a side note. I was certainly devastated - and I
<br>
hadn't been in the WTC since 1984 or in  NYC (or the US) since 1997. I do
<br>
have friends who live/work in NY and others currently travelling in that
<br>
part of the US.
<br>
<p>I also scarcely know where to begin in responding to the very good posts of
<br>
Greg Burch and Adrian Tymes, among others
<br>
<p>Greg said
<br>
<p><p>The irony of calling on god - the nearly universal reaction of America's
<br>
political leaders - was completely lost on the media.  NONE of the talking
<br>
heads on the tube noted it.  Oh well . . .
<br>
<p>The root problem is not US foreign policy, as some here have suggested.  It'
<br>
s that there is a widely distributed culture of fanaticism in the Islamic
<br>
world.  It focuses on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but it certainly has
<br>
other objects, as well.  Consider that the savagery of the Taliban has
<br>
basically nothing to do with the on-going crisis in the Levant.  Examples
<br>
can be found from Algeria to Indonesia that have nothing to do with
<br>
Palestinian nationalism.  That culture of fanaticism has secured the &quot;sacred
<br>
high ground&quot; throughout the Islamic world.  As a result, there is no secure
<br>
middle ground in politics or culture in the Islamic world.  This is because
<br>
Islamism is truly totalitarian, or &quot;culturally hegemonistic,&quot; to borrow a
<br>
phrase form Marxist rhetoric, i.e. it makes claim to relevance to and
<br>
dominance over every aspect of life.  Contrary to the claims of
<br>
Arab-Americans and others today, and in the days that follow, that the
<br>
9/11/01 attacks don't represent &quot;true Islam&quot;, in fact they do.  They
<br>
represent precisely the aspects of Islam that made it the most successfully
<br>
viral meme in human history.
<br>
<p>And herein lies the ultimate, gut-wrenching irony and threat: Our political
<br>
and cultural leaders cannot condemn this root cause of the problem.  On the
<br>
one hand, it would likely be ineffective.  Condemnation of Islamism would be
<br>
interpreted by Moslems all over the world as the simple rhetoric of
<br>
inter-religious bigotry and ompetition.  In other words, condemning Islam
<br>
for what it is would be heard by Moslems as the same kind of rhetoric that
<br>
has fueled inter-religious wars throughout history, no different than the
<br>
kind of pronouncements made by leaders on both sides of the European
<br>
religious wars of the Reformation.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the modern dogma of cultural relativism makes any kind of
<br>
public judgment of one culture by another impossible.  Any condemnation of
<br>
Islam for the fertilizer of fanaticism that it is would be interpreted by
<br>
the shapers of our own culture as chauvinism.  Thus, our public discourse is
<br>
condemned to a fundamental impotence: We cannot as a civilization even TALK
<br>
about the root cause of the problem.
<br>
<p>========================================================================
<br>
<p>As Adrian says, there's some more to it than that, but I agree with Greg's
<br>
comments as far as they go. It is difficult to have a robust public debate
<br>
about religious fanaticism because of politically correct/post-colonialist
<br>
etc attitudes that are overwhelmingly predominant among journalists,
<br>
academics etc. The issue of intolerant cultures is a huge one here in
<br>
Australia, one we cannot discuss openly except at the crude level of
<br>
talkback radio, with so many people from Muslim countries wanting to flee
<br>
here from repressive regimes. I was against our government's approach to the
<br>
Tampa crisis last week (which now looks insignificant), and I tend to favour
<br>
immigration from Asia and the Middle East,  but we do need to be able to
<br>
talk openly about cultural issues (in this sense) without being considered
<br>
racist.
<br>
<p>All that said, I also agree with the thought that we do need, long term,
<br>
some kind of non-hostile way to address the problem of religious
<br>
fundamentalism, Muslim or otherwise. Islam does not have to be as bad as we
<br>
are experiencing it in current times as a geopolitical force. Historically,
<br>
Christianity was probably worse but has been tamed to some extent by
<br>
rationalist and (classical) liberal ideas.
<br>
<p>I'm afraid I can't contribute much to this discussion. I need to fly out to
<br>
Europe (getting in a plane now seems like a very different prospect than it
<br>
did two days ago!) very soon and have some nasty deadlines to meet before
<br>
that, which mean I'll be dropping off the list in a day or so for about two
<br>
months. I'll still be able to check this e-mail address and my hotmail
<br>
account occasionally on my travels if anyone needs/wishes to contact me.
