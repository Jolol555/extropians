Paisano!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, just to be clear where I'm coming from, I am employed as a lawyer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in one of Australia's most prestigious firms (though about to enter early,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if possibly temporary, retirement!!) so perhaps I know *something* about
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; law &lt;g&gt;, though this is hardly conclusive evidence. I have extensive
</em><br>
formal
<br>
<em>&gt; study under my belt in both law and philosophy, with *very* high grades,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including first class honours results in both Property Law and
</em><br>
Jurisprudence
<br>
<em>&gt; (ie philosophy of law). I have read extensively in these fields and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally in political and ethical philosophy (as you'd know, the subject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters of jurisprudence and political philosophy are largely the same, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least overlap very heavily). I have thought about the issues at great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; length over the years and sometimes with all too much earnestness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have probably been too self-deprecating in some of my comments (but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't claim to have all the answers).
</em><br>
<p>Seriously, I'm getting ready for a big trial right now, but I certainly
<br>
welcome more lawyers on the list, and look forward to being able to engage
<br>
in some good discussion with you in the future.  What sort of practice do
<br>
you have?
<br>
<p>And congratulations on the early retirement -- you survived &quot;a life in the
<br>
law&quot;.
<br>
