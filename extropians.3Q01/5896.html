</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition and his development in these areas appears to be accelerating
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; father confided in me this afternoon, though, that the boy is lagging in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading skills: He's bored with what he's given to read at school and, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his parents are very fine people, they have only a modest education and are
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest him in some science fiction, his father's eyes lit up and he
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's the only problem: I don't know what to suggest for a super-bright
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10-year-old in 2001.  I was cutting my teeth on RAH's and Bradbury's (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other one)juveniles at that time and fairly quickly graduated to His Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Blessed Insightfulness, the Serene Maestro of Serendip.  What's good these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; days?
</em><br>
<p>Don't know what his reading level is, but Azimov is always a good
<br>
starter, and RAH and Bradbury are also good. I don't read juvies these
<br>
days, so I don't know of any, but I'll bet that you can't go wrong with
<br>
Star Trek and Star Wars series novels if the kid is a good enough
<br>
reader.
