<em>&gt;From: &quot;Mitchell, Jerry (3337)&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:Jerry.Mitchell@esavio.com?Subject=Re:%20Paying%20for%20Schools&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108291425.HAA06379@well.com&gt;">Jerry.Mitchell@esavio.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Every benefit modern workers enjoy was earned for them by Union
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;labor. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Really? I dont remember my stock options being paid for in blood,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or the extra vacation days above the minimum either. 
</em><br>
<p>The operative words here are &quot;I don't remember&quot;, that's because
<br>
these rights and a whole bunch of others you probably take for
<br>
granted were earned by the efforts of union members long before you
<br>
were born.
<br>
<p>8 hour work days, 40 hour work weeks, sick time, vacation time,
<br>
overtime pay, health benefits.... The list goes on and on.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;You need to learn that supply and demand work for LABOR as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;products. If labor is short, they HAVE to up pay and benefits to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;keep workers. Yeah, it was tough at first, but I put forth that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the labor movement had just let the industries grow until there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was a labor shortage, you would have had the same result and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probably the workers would have had far MORE benefits then today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By artificially extracting resources from the buisnesses, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;caused an aberation in the market that caused buisnesses to grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more slowly, thereby preventing them from producing jobs as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quckly. This resulted in the balance of supply and demand of labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;taking even longer to come into balance. They cut their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;throats.
</em><br>
<p>Actually you'll find I understand supply and demand as well as a
<br>
host of macro/microeconomic theory as well.
<br>
<p>Tough? People were starving to death while others made millions.
<br>
Businesses didn't start handing out benefits from the goodness of
<br>
their hearts, these rights had to be earned by struggle, our
<br>
predecessors fought and died for each and every one.
<br>
<p>Their is no labor shortage if you are the only business in town
<br>
(monopsony) think West Virginia mining town, think Hershey
<br>
Pennsylvania, think Flint Michigan.
<br>
<p>Labor shortages are a modern problem, although skilled labor
<br>
probably always has been, especially labor willing to work for what
<br>
you're willing to pay. Note the surge in H-1(a) visas to allow high
<br>
tech workers from other countries to displace high tech workers
<br>
here, holding down the cost.
<br>
<p>Early unions forced business to be competitive for labor, not the
<br>
other way around.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I never said that all the old buisness owners were angels, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dont hear you telling the story of how teamsters were gentle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-violent protestors either. How many people did they kill or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maim for crossing picket lines (when those people crossing were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just trying to make enough to feed their kids)?
</em><br>
<p>What do you think was happening to the children of those on the
<br>
picket line? Steak and lobster every night? These people were and
<br>
are fighting for survival.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Everone that wants to slam these &quot;Evil Capitalists&quot; need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kissing their feet for providing jobs for all those people that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would have otherwise starved. Buisnesses no more set the price of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;labor then they do for sneakers.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not condemning capitalists or capitalism, I AM a capitalist.
<br>
But I refuse to ignore the past or current excesses of individuals
<br>
or corporations, or the technical shortcomings of capitalism
<br>
itself, and I continue to successfully negotiate for a fair share
<br>
of the profits.
