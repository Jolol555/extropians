<p>Have seen the movie &quot;Rollerball&quot;, Lee?
<br>
<p>How likely is it that a few mega-corporations will offer anybody free 
<br>
choice when they can carve up the world into non-competing groups? We are 
<br>
already racing headlong toward that arrangement now. Already when several 
<br>
companies dominate a field they often don't really compete -- they politely 
<br>
agree upon what they think they can get and fix the prices. How much less 
<br>
likely do you think it will be when governments can no longer break up 
<br>
monopolies or unhealthy concentrations of power? Do you think the simple 
<br>
system of a free market offers any solution to consolidation of power into 
<br>
fewer and fewer hands?
<br>
<p>Capitalism is great as far as it goes, but it has that same failing that 
<br>
most other systems have: all the power ends up in a few hands. Those hands 
<br>
can be benevolent or malevolent. If anybody can tell me a way out of that I 
<br>
am all ears.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;the more [societies] are under centralized control---the worse they are.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is exactly my point.
<br>
<p><p>I will repeat my standard disclaimer: I am not anti-capitalist. I am just 
<br>
against the use of it as a replacement religion. Religions of any color are 
<br>
unhealthy.
<br>
<p>I actually might desist from chatting on this thread much anymore. It makes 
<br>
me look like a pessimist. In actual fact, I really do think we will find a 
<br>
solution (I have a feeling it is in the open-source movement somehow). Also 
<br>
I feel like it is a bit like arguing with religious believers, with my 
<br>
point being continually missed. It is really not that big a point that I 
<br>
should take up this much time... all I wanted to do was just to sound a 
<br>
note of caution.
<br>
<p>And I have got no work done.  :-(
<br>
I have to work so I can realise my own capitalist aims.  :-)
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
