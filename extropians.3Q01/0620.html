I think we'll learn a lot about chip implants when Professor War-borg does
<br>
his next experiment early next year. If I understood it correctly, this
<br>
time he is going to determine if the afferent connections work well enough
<br>
to upload significant amounts of information directly from chip to
<br>
brain. Anyay, the article is in Wired, Feb/01.

<em>&gt; (that link may not work after today):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    The movie &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; raises the wrong questions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    about our future with computers because it gets the technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    wrong. It will be far easier to make us more like computers than to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    make computers more like us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Chip implants will make that possible because chips have so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    advantages over brains and robots.  Brains are wet and have random
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    wiring. They need sugar and oxygen and sleep. They risk stroke and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    need a special cooling system for their thick skull-based housing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    ...So the real question is not whether robots will replace humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    but whether chips will replace brains.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    That question may raise many ethical issues, but the answer to it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    surely yes. ...  Moore's Law ...  chips in 2020 or so will have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    raw processing power of the human brain and will forever exceed it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    after that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course he is glossing over the tremendous difficulties involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in interfacing a chip to the brain in such a way that it can provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningful information, especially if it is going to extend our memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so that chip-based memories and data &quot;feel&quot; normal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    The distant but inevitable step is not just to back up the brain but to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    replace it outright. Then the music of the mind will play on a digital
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    instrument with almost godlike powers. Such chip minds will have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    bit-based omniscience because they could access all knowledge and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    all databases at the speed of light and never forget any of it. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    could easily relive and edit and alter any past physical or emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    experience and do so with the same &quot;real&quot; intensity as when someone's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    flesh first experienced it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Chip minds will have a bit-based omnipotence because they could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    create entire virtual worlds simply by imagining them. Let's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    forget that the world we see &quot;out there&quot; is but an illusion in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    neural circuitry of our brain's visual cortex.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Even our subjective sense of time will change. We find the second a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    meaningful unit of time because electrical signals travel so slowly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    through our nerves. Chip time, or &quot;nanotime,&quot; will be millions or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    billions of times faster. One second of brain time will equal years
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    or even decades of chip time. This will give chip minds a bit-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    approximation of eternity. That also will mean a robot with a chip
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    mind would find brain-based humans frozen as if they were clay models
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    in a time-lapsed animation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This part isn't consistent with the idea of chip implants, or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chips replacing the brain within a biological body.  Apparently he must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be talking about an upload scenario.  Obviously you wouldn't want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replace your brain with a chip going billions of times faster if your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body is still going about its business the same old way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought this inconsistency weakened the article somewhat.  While I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can understand that presenting the idea of uploading would undercut the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attractive picture he is painting, it's confusing at the end as we picture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our bodies standing around frozen while our minds zoom off into infinity.
