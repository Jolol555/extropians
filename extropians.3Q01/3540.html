<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;Joe, I welcome anyone checking the archives, your story (1200 e-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;mails in three days) is a complete fabrication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;I went to considerable lengths onetime to post a list demonstrating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;that there is an existing federal gun control law covering everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;of your objections.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; But no databases to enforce them, such as I proposed (a purchase-prohibited database including violent criminals and the mentally defective and/or deranged), which would make it harder for the irresponsibles more likely to backshoot to obtain the quick 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and easy means to committ long-range mass murder, while still preserving the rights of sane and law-abiding citizens to purchase, keep and bear in anonymity (unregistered).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Once again, Joe, you continue to promulgate your lies and propaganda.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There IS in fact, a purchase prohibited database. It is called the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'National Insta-Check System', which is part of the Brady Act. You have,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in fact, been told of its existence innumerable times in the past, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you persist on ignoring. The fact that you continue to ignore our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pointing this fact out to you is rather indicative of your true
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intentions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
The difficulties with the present system are its spotty ability to access state and local databases; most convictions and committments are not exercised under federal auspices, so a plethora of people who shpuld not, based upon their past irresponsible behavior, be allowed to keep and bear fall through the cracks.  This problem will be fixed in the future, within three years, I'd say, but it is far from fixed now, and was even farther from being fixed when the original debate took place.  As of now, waiting a few days for state and local info. to filter through (until insta-check is truly comprehensive) would seem to be the prudent course to take.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;You decided to completely ignore this and go off on a rant about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;gun shows instead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Columbine (and the purchase of weapons used in it at a gun show) had a lot to do with the tenor of that time, and sales at gun shows, flea markets and pawn shops should have to go through the same checking and verification procedures that gun shops are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expected to observe; the loophole should be closed.  Eve John McCain agrees with this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yet there is NO 'loophole'. Anyone who is a dealer must use the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Insta-check system at gun shows, another fact which YOU, as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;McCain and HCI and AGS and VPC all continue to ignore and lie about in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their, and your, propaganda. The fact that your pronouncements seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be verbatim quotes from HCI and VPC websites and ads belies your true
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intentions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Actually, I'm remembering reading my newspaper.  And as I said before, Insta-check is not yet comprehensive, that is, it doesn't yet access state and local databases.  When it does, I'll have no problem with it, and in fact will applaud it.  And my true intentions are to keep weapons out of the hands of irresponsibles as much as possible, while at the same time keeping it as easy as possible for responsible people to obtain them.  Anything else you read in is just ascribable to your pronounced tendency to paranoia about vast left-wing conspiracies, kinda like a RW Hillary Clinton Doppelganger.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;You continue to rant, and name call when its been pointed out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;numerous times this is against list rules.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; And 'socialist', 'collectivist', 'statist', 'pinko', and the rest of the RW club's preferred list of epithets do not qualify, hmmmm?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As ANYONE on this list can attest, it was you who started the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sniping fest. I believe that you got all hot under the collar because we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were posting historical facts about how gun control laws are always used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by fascists and other left wing authoritarians when they plan on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enslaving people and committing genocide. If you took our recitation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these facts to mean we were labeling you as one such, none such labeling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was intended, unless, of course, you really are such a person....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fascists tend to continually lie, ignore the facts, and spout vile
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accusations and slander against their opponents as well....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hmmmmmmm.......
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
(Mike says as, at the same time he insinuates vile accusations and slanders against me, who he perceives as an opponent, rather than just someone pissed off by his uncouthities....hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...)
<br>
Yaknow, fascists just couldn't stand to have plural viewpoints on issues; sound like anyone we both know?
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;Typical Joe Dees tactics. Your actions speak for themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; As have yours and those of your droogz.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;I saw something interesting in one of your other posts though, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;claim to be a former Veteran. Please elaborate, this will be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;easy thing to check.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Done in another post.  And were you ever in the military?  Howzabout Mikey and the rest of the Flak Pack?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;USAF, 1988-1990, Aircraft Electrical and Environmental Technician on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;F-15 and F-111D aircraft, among others, in the 318th FIS at McChord AFB
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the 37th EMS at Cannon AFB, also anti-sniper security ajutant on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;few assignments.
