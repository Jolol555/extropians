<p>Love your sense of humor, Michael Butler!
<br>
<p>As for me, I've already decided to take what's left of my marbles and go
<br>
home (i.e., I've spent all I have on the subject -- &quot;all gone&quot;).
<br>
<p>I second the motion - re Russell Blackford's eloquent post expressing his
<br>
reservations about &quot;getting bogged down in interminable, energy-sapping
<br>
debate with people whom I basically think of, or want to think of, as
<br>
transhumanist allies.&quot; (Dear Russell, your thoughfulness, intelligence and
<br>
humanity radiates through your writing.  I appreciate you very much, for
<br>
what it's worth.)
<br>
<p>And Damien - what can I say? - if there is a &quot;fauxever&quot; heaven, people like
<br>
Damien would make it worthwhile and interesting and fun - love and
<br>
happiness.  Conversely, (and I regret saying this):  if there's a &quot;fauxever&quot;
<br>
hell, it will be filled with Ayn-Rand-collective drones.  I would
<br>
regretfully have to commit electronic hara-kiri.  I'm speaking through the
<br>
pox of my own imagination and non-enhanced brain now, so please pardon my
<br>
lack of foresight about the as-yet-unimaginable future where &quot;miracles&quot; will
<br>
never cease, I'm certain, and everyone will be warm,  fuzzy and downright
<br>
amusing (I cannot live without off-the-cuffs, preferably on the droll side).
<br>
<p>This is not good-bye, by any means.  I'm not leaving the list, and I'm not
<br>
going to lurk (but maybe for a while).
<br>
<p>Until we meet again,
<br>
Olga
<br>
<p>P.S. Eliezer, if you can straighten me on what I perceived as a little
<br>
inconsistency regarding your &quot;sentient&quot; view of yourself, I would appreciate
<br>
it.  If you decide not to bother, that's cool.  I may have misunderstood, in
<br>
any case.
