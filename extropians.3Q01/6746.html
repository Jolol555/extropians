The military and reconnaissance agencies have already considered these types
<br>
of devices.  Although technology in the private sector has greatly increased
<br>
in the last few years, it is still far behind top-secret military
<br>
technology.  A spy satellite in orbit, with a larger and more sophisticated
<br>
camera, can probably get better resolution pictures than these small devices
<br>
up close.  For going inside buildings or into tunnels, the reception becomes
<br>
the next big limiting factor.
<br>
<p>Besides, what is it that you think we will get a picture of?  These kinds of
<br>
drones can't get close enough to bug a meeting.  Such transmitters can be
<br>
detected with radio-reception devices.  If the drones have to stay far away,
<br>
we could do little more than map locations or detect movements of people and
<br>
equipment.  We already have this capability today.  I'm not sure what exact
<br>
benefit these little birds add to our satellite net that we already have.
<br>
<p>I guess the real problem is not one that can be solved with technology.
<br>
It's not that we don't have the spy tools that work.  The problem is that we
<br>
don't know where to look.  We can point a spy satellite to any specific spot
<br>
on earth, and get a resolution down far enough to read license plates.
<br>
That's too much detail.  We can't watch every tent in the Middle East at
<br>
once.  Like with these little drones, we would need intelligence of where to
<br>
spy.  As with all technology, doing something is easy, figuring out what to
<br>
do is hard.  I don't think there is a technology problem to be solved here.
<br>
I think there are procedural and operational problems.
<br>
<p>I know it is fun to speculate on these kinds of devices, but it is naive to
<br>
think that our military and government haven't already looked into these
<br>
mundane kind of devices.  I doubt anything we dream up on this list now will
<br>
be advanced enough or could be implemented fast enough to participate in the
<br>
current crisis.  I personally think it would be more interesting to think
<br>
about future responses with future technology, which is unpredictable and
<br>
new enough that we might have a chance to develop some new ideas.
