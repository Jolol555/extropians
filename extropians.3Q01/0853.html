<em>&gt; For me, that is not as important as the answer to the question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Is it *good* for *me*?&quot; For a number of things in my life I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet understand the working details, however, I use those things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nevertheless.
</em><br>
<p>It may be good for you in the short term, but in the long term it may handicap
<br>
you. An analogy is morphine. It may be good for you during a surgical
<br>
treatment, but watch out for the addictive danger.
<br>
<p>Likewise religiosity (or the softer drug, synchonicity) may help folks get
<br>
through a difficult situation, but let's not kid ourselves about the potential
<br>
harm it can do if inloaded over an extended amount of time, and as soon as
<br>
practical, let's try to wean the patient from the medication.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The premise in my (and other authors) definition of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'synchronicity' is that an objective value exists irrespective of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether it is acknowledged by the observer, but the meaning appears
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only when the observer is open to it.
</em><br>
<p>That sounds a lot like good timing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But is it my imagination or is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really true, you ask?
</em><br>
<p>It's really true: Learning new material when you're open to it (good timing)
<br>
promotes efficient education.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you view synchronicity as a meaningful coincidence between an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external event and an internal readiness for being aware of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; event, then synchronicity acts as a bridge to our unconscious mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or, at least, to the very edge of our conscious mind. Why is that?
</em><br>
<p>You said it yourself. It's coincidence, which means the co-incidence of two
<br>
events, in this case your readiness for it, and the external event.
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; Heh.. I happen to think that the smell of garlic and onion is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of the most divine smells in the Universe...
</em><br>
<p>Me too. &quot;Synchronicity&quot;? No, just similar tastes.
<br>

<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
