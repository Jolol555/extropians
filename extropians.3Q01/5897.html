<em>&gt; &gt; The fact is that at this point in time, extending human life produces no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; positive return on investment. Retirement ages are fixed, so any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extension in human life only increases the demand for social security
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; funding and the further increase in confiscatory taxation that funds it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uh.  Is anyone going to force you to actually retire?  I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think so.
</em><br>
<p>Me? Not likely, but most of society does, and will continue to do so.
<br>
When the Social Security system was set up with a retirement age of 65,
<br>
the average life expectancy was only 62. Today expectancy is 76 and
<br>
rising, yet the retirement age is still 65 and is only going up by 2
<br>
years over the next decade. The social security system is only failing
<br>
because the retirement age is not being indexed to life expectancy.
<br>
<p>If, instead, they increased the retirement age by one year for every two
<br>
years of increased life expectancy, making retirement at 72 today, the
<br>
system would be well balanced out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The VA has very good stats on this (don't have a link at present), but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the DoD found in the 80's that their programs to get veterans and aging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; active duty personnel to quit smoking and drinking resulted in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; explosion in VA costs as vets lived far longer, and at far greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expense to the military retiree health care system, than if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; remained addicted and just conveniently died off several years after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; retirment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you are proposing we kill people off with major booze and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tobacco habits to save a few bucks?
</em><br>
<p>No, of course not, but these figures expose the lie that is made that
<br>
eliminating such voluntary activities will reduce the cost of the
<br>
retirement system. They won't, instead they will vastly increase the
<br>
costs, and thus lead us further into higher taxation and nanny statism.
<br>
Beware the claims of advocacy groups like this, they know that larger
<br>
bureaucracies means more opportunities for advocacy groups to feed at
<br>
the public trough.
<br>
<p>Instead, I think that if people are stupid enough to engage in such
<br>
activities to the detriment of their life expectancy, it is their
<br>
freedom to do so and we shouldn't try to make them feel guilty about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you want a return on your tax dollar, index the retirment age to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; average life expectancy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't want any tax dollars that I need to worry about getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a return on personally.  And I don't support government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mandating when people will retire one way or the other.  And I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't support the Social inSecurity program.
</em><br>
<p>Well, good, but so long as it does exist, I think that idiots should be
<br>
free to reduce my tax burden for me by conveniently dying off due to
<br>
their own preferred behaviors. I'm not in the mood to tell them to stop,
<br>
and I don't think anybody else should either.
