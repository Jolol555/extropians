</em><br>
<p>Not really.  You have been on the list long enough that I know deliberate
<br>
trolling is not your style.  I was really defending against Mike's assertion
<br>
that only liberals were failing to respond to this debate.  Of course, my
<br>
examples of how the original posters were likewise failing to respond would
<br>
appear to be an escalation of finger pointing.  Any assertion of &quot;not me&quot;
<br>
looks very much like &quot;it's them&quot;.  I didn't mean to get into the blame game.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My apology was regarding your interpretation of events.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks.  You had nothing to apologize for, and it was magnanimous to do so
<br>
anyway.  I did not feel personally attacked, and do not get as emotional as
<br>
some people.  However, I do have a tendency to pile on and make a million
<br>
points at once.  When I'm done, it does appear to be a huge diatribe against
<br>
a topic when I really just meant to point out a few items.  (It is the
<br>
frustrated writer wannabe in me.  I like to write.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I haven't cried foul, as far as I can see. OTOH, it is true that, to date,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I haven't completed my reply to your comments, Harvey. There are a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of reasons, none of which are relevant to the list. When the dust settles,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll get to it. That might be some time from now, but I will.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that you haven't cried foul.  In fact, it may be that Mike cried
<br>
foul on behalf of the original posters, and I attributed it to a whole
<br>
group.  I responded to Mike's conservatives vs. liberals post, and probably
<br>
fell into lumping all the original posters together.  I also remember a few
<br>
postings that were misattributing their quotes of other people.  So it is
<br>
very difficult to keep track of everybody's position.
