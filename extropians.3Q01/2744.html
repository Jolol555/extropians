<em>&gt;This is simply wrong, and shows a lack of historical knowledge with respect

</em><br>
<em>&gt;if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you study, you will find many more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lots of ethnic groups suffered from slavery and persistent abuse in this

</em><br>
<em>&gt;because they are the only good example of a group that didn't &quot;correct

<em>&gt;a generation or two, why haven't the blacks?  The superlatives that you 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the tragedy that the blacks suffered are equally applicable to other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ethnic groups in this country; you either aren't aware of it or you are
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I sense either legitimate ignorance, or intentional trolling.  I'll give you 
<br>
the benefit of the doubt and assume the former.  &quot;Lots of ethnic groups 
<br>
suffered from slavery?&quot;  Not quite.  There were, of course, indentured 
<br>
servitude and unfair exploitation of labor by business which were not 
<br>
race-based.  But non-black &quot;slavery?&quot;  Simply, no.  There may have been the 
<br>
odd individual slave of any ethnicity (as there continue to be to this very 
<br>
day), but only blacks were bought and sold into life-long slavery as a race.
<br>
<p>Indentured servitude and the like were based upon economic status.  If you 
<br>
had no other means of income you worked for free for a certain finite period 
<br>
of time, after which you were free to go - usually with a pocket full of 
<br>
change for your trouble.  Slavery was based on race only.  If you were 
<br>
black, you were chattel - regardless of whatever skills or abilities you 
<br>
possessed.  And for the great majority there was no buying your way to 
<br>
freedom.  As long as you were black, you were property.
<br>
<p>Concerning no other race than blacks did the law expressly provide that the 
<br>
members of that race had &quot;no rights&quot; which any white man was bound to 
<br>
respect.  There really is no dispute about it if you know the least bit 
<br>
about early US history.
<br>

<p>Life is good.  Refuse to die.
