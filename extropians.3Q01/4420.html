<p><em>&gt; Robert is right, but I don't think this small technical error

<p>What is the argument? I don't have the URL.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; similarity between flagellar and electrical motors is, however,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct that unlike macro-scale motors, the flagellar motor is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magnetic. It is apparently electrostatic, and/or may rely on changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in shapes of proteins; the details are not known.
</em><br>
<p>What's the argument? That you can't make NEMS motors? That's nonsense,
<br>
we've got MEMS motors already -- which happen to be electrostatic -- and
<br>
we've got linear actuators made from telescoping concentric buckys --
<br>
which -- gosh -- also happen to be electrostatic. Even Nanosystems already
<br>
said you need to go electrostatic, not electromagnetical, as that doesn't
<br>
scale.
<br>
<p>So you can most assuredly make electrostatic motors with graphenes, and
<br>
the darn thing would have rpms in GHz range, if appropriately sized.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, the proton gradient itself is presumably maintained by molecular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pumps powered by ATP, so there is a sense in which Whitesides'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement can be interpreted as being correct.
</em><br>
<p>Again, what is the argument?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think it would be relevant here to list the specific criticisms that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whitesides made based on this misconception of submarine size, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to show that they would not be relevant.  It seemed that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; main point made by Whitesides with regards to the size of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; submarine was the difficulty in navigation due to Brownian motion.
</em><br>
<p>Well, bacteria manage to navigate nicely using flagellar propulsion within
<br>
animal cells, so I don't see why an array of electrostatic motors with
<br>
bucky or sapphire fibers sticking out wouldn't make for a rather speedy
<br>
nanosub.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However he is wrong about the Brownian effects since the subs would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much larger than he assumes.  Also, Freitas suggests that the nanobots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be able to travel at 1 cm/sec (100 times faster than the 100-200
</em><br>
<em>&gt; microns per second of sperm).  This is fast enough to negotiate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capillaries and small blood vessels without much difficulty.
</em><br>
<p>You can of course stick and crawl, or burrow through tissue, too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your references rely pretty heavily on Freitas.  Another article I like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is Merkle's hydrocarbon metabolism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/hydroCarbonMetabolism.html">http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/hydroCarbonMetabolism.html</a>, which is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best article I've seen to address the &quot;grabbing atoms&quot; issue.  He shows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific molecular structures for reactive tools which can be used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; add or remove hydrogen and carbon atoms, as well as to build more of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tools.
</em><br>
<p>The problem with this is that you use reactive moieties attached to rigid
<br>
rods which imply bulk (which he sidesteps by showing them as quadratic
<br>
blocks), which have to touch down at a surface (one hemisphere of space is
<br>
hence unaccessible). Several of the moieties much be present at the site
<br>
simultaneously, which is difficult to steric hindrance which he refers to
<br>
as the fat fingers problem. Plus you have to cycle the rods, retracting,
<br>
recycling and protruding them again in a rapid oscillation, which implies
<br>
you have to minimize bulk, or be slow and burn a lot of juice.
<br>
<p>This is unelegant. What would make more sense is a nanolithoprinter, using
<br>
a flexible hollow (e.g. graphene) duct to transport monomers and a head
<br>
with an aperture aligning them and activating them with a current pulse,
<br>
at least initially (when you've got a cluster bristling with radicals you
<br>
can just firehose your allenes at it, and they will stick). That may not
<br>
give you atomic control, but when do you really need atomic control? I see
<br>
no showstoppers even if you can deposit only a tiny subset of all possible
<br>
structures, as long as the repertoire is sufficiently rich.
<br>
<p>Once you have got your computronium, you can burn ridiculous amounts of
<br>
simulation time to fit the optimal paradigm, and optimize it into
<br>
ridiculous dexterity, here you're only constrained by raw physics, and
<br>
local physics looks so far extremely friendly to hackers.
