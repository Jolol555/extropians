&lt;I think that the best option is secession of some small population US
<br>
state. Look at the Free State Project (<a href="http://www.freestateproject.org">http://www.freestateproject.org</a>),
<br>
which seeks to get 20,000 libertarian minded people to move to one state
<br>
to tip its political balance toward libertarian policies if not outright
<br>
secession. Current top candidates are New Hampshire and Alaska, among
<br>
others like Wyoming, etc. Note that the secessionist party in Alaska
<br>
allegedly got 25% of the vote in the last election, and New Hampshire
<br>
has elected more libertarian state legistlators (25) in the last ten
<br>
years than any other.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say Alaska would be the best bet.  620,000 population.
<br>
Not sure whether that includes military personnell.  You'd have to be
<br>
prepared for some shenigans involving absentee voting by all the 
<br>
military personnel who spent a tour in Alaska and declared it their
<br>
home of record to get the resident stipend :)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's arguably the best state to go it alone, geographically isolated,
<br>
plentiful rescources, not sharing a common border with the states is 
<br>
helpful.  But maybe the most important part is only Hawaii has a 
<br>
better legitimate legal justification for seccession.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing about a statewide referendum on the &quot;4 choices&quot; wouldn't
<br>
be nearly as difficult to pull off as trying to get a plurality in Wyoming.
<br>
To say nothing of trying to run an independant country out of New 
<br>
Hampshire.
