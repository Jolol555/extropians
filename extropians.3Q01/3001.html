<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:  News exclusive to our ezine readers
<br>
Two hundred-fifty million year old living organism found
<br>
<p>The finding of a viable bacteria spore trapped within an ancient rock
<br>
crystal, has caused scientists to question whether some bacteria are
<br>
immortal.  In a letter published in the October 2000 issue of the journal
<br>
Nature, scientists announced the finding of a bacteria spore within a brine
<br>
inclusion in a salt crystal which was dated at  250 million years old or
<br>
older.  In an accompanying &quot;News and Views&quot; commentary entitled,
<br>
&quot;Microbiology:  A case of bacterial immortality?&quot; author R John Parks of the
<br>
University of Bristol asked, &quot;If bacteria can survive for this length of
<br>
time, why should they die at all?&quot;
<br>
<p>Spores are resistant structures formed by bacteria that are known to survive
<br>
for long periods.  Although researchers have found and cultured live spores
<br>
from ancient rocks and coal, the possibility of contamination of the sample
<br>
with bacteria from an outside source has rendered these results
<br>
questionable.  In the 1990s, scientists found bacteria inside a bee
<br>
preserved in amber that was between 25 and 40 million years old.  The
<br>
surface of the amber was sterilized prior to removing the spores to
<br>
eliminate the possibility of outside contamination.  The spores were
<br>
subsequently cultured and found to be viable.
<br>
<p>In this latest finding, the bacteria push back the age of the longest-lived
<br>
organism on earth to ten times that of the previous discovery.  Researcher
<br>
Russell H Vreeland and colleagues utilized stringent sterilization
<br>
procedures on the surface of the sample and on the drill apparatus, and
<br>
drilled into the fluid inclusion.  The bacteria (of the genus Bacillus) was
<br>
inoculated into a growth medium, where it then grew.  Because of the extent
<br>
of sterilization procedures used, Vreeland estimates the chance of
<br>
contamination as one in one billion.
<br>
<p>In the Nature commentary, replication of these results is urged to ensure
<br>
their full acceptance.  However, the author admits that the implications of
<br>
the finding are profound.  The discovery of a 250 million year old life form
<br>
has prompted the speculation that immortality could be possible for at least
<br>
one species.  It remains for researchers to discover what it is that enables
<br>
them to survive.
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
Low DHEA levels predict death in male smokers
<br>
<p>DHEA is a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands, whose levels may be
<br>
correlated with longevity. Levels of the hormone are higher in men than in
<br>
women and have been negatively correlated in men with increased short term
<br>
mortality in one study. In another study, published in the July 3 2001 issue
<br>
of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers utilized
<br>
data from the PAQUID program, a prospective cohort study of 3,777 elderly
<br>
individuals living in southern France. Six hundred twenty-two participants
<br>
in the current study had their blood tested for DHEA sulfate at a one year
<br>
follow-up, and 346 were tested after eight years, with 290 of these used in
<br>
the statistical analysis. Participants were interviewed in order to obtain
<br>
sociodemographic information, smoking status, wine consumption, physical
<br>
activity and medical parameters such as current medication use, personal
<br>
history of disease, physical function disability and subjective health
<br>
perceptions. Cognitive function and depression were also assessed.
<br>
<p>Interestingly, DHEA Sulfate levels were found to increase in one third of
<br>
the subjects while declining in two thirds. The rise in DHEA in this
<br>
minority could possibly be due to subclinical impairment of kidney and liver
<br>
function, but this was not explored. The researchers found no correlation
<br>
with health parameters collected initially and DHEA levels. However for men,
<br>
the risk of death at ten year followup was doubled when the initial DHEA
<br>
sulfate level was low. This risk increased for male smokers, with low DHEA
<br>
sulfate levels emerging as a reliable predictor of death in this group. The
<br>
authors question if tobacco could lower DHEA sulfate or if low DHEA sulfate
<br>
levels are an indicator or potentiator of cardiovascular disease related to
<br>
smoking.

<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
DHEA replacement therapy
<br>
<p>In 1981 the Life Extension Foundation introduced DHEA
<br>
(dehydroepiandrosterone) through an article that described the multiple
<br>
antiaging effects this hormone might produce. The general public learned
<br>
about DHEA in 1996, as the benefits of DHEA were touted by the news media
<br>
and in several popular books.  DHEA obtained credibility in the medical
<br>
establishment when the New York Academy of Sciences published a book
<br>
entitled DHEA and Aging and summarized in their journal, Aging (Dec. 29,
<br>
1995, 774:1-350). This highly technical book provided scientific validation
<br>
for the many life extension effects of DHEA replacement therapy.
<br>
<p>DHEA replacement therapy involves the supplementation of the hormone to
<br>
restore serum levels to those of a 21-year-old. DHEA is a precursor building
<br>
block that allows our bodies to more easily create hormones that may be in
<br>
decline because of age, disease, prescription medications, or other factors.
<br>
Hormones such as testosterone and estrogen as well as serum DHEA levels
<br>
begin to decline between 25 and 30 years of age and may be reduced by 95% of
<br>
youthful peak levels by age 85.
<br>
<p>In the journal Drugs and Aging (Oct. 1996), an analysis of previous studies
<br>
on DHEA showed that:
<br>
<p>In both humans and animals, the decline of DHEA production with aging is
<br>
associated with immune depression, increased risk of several different
<br>
cancers, loss of sleep, decreased feelings of well being, and increased
<br>
mortality.
<br>
<p>DHEA replacement in aged mice significantly improved immune function to a
<br>
more youthful state.
<br>
<p>DHEA replacement has shown a favorable effect on osteoclasts and lymphoid
<br>
cells, an effect that may delay osteoporosis. (Editor's note: DHEA has been
<br>
shown in other studies to promote the activity of bone-forming osteoblasts.)
<br>
<p>Low levels of DHEA inhibit energy metabolism, thus increasing the risk of
<br>
heart disease and diabetes mellitus.
<br>
<p>Studies in humans show essentially no toxicity at doses that restore DHEA to
<br>
youthful levels. DHEA deficiency may expedite the development of some
<br>
diseases that are common in the elderly.

FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>DHEA 15 mg capsules
<br>
<p>The Life Extension Foundation has been investigating DHEA for more than 20
<br>
years. Only The Life Extension Foundation publishes a DHEA Protocol that
<br>
enables people to use DHEA safely by providing specific dosing and blood
<br>
testing schedules. In more than 2,000 published studies, DHEA has been shown
<br>
to have a role in improving neurologic function, immune function, stress
<br>
disorders, hormonal modulation and numerous diseases associated with normal
<br>
aging.
<br>
<p>The most remarkable finding about DHEA comes from a human study by S.S.C.
<br>
Yen and associates at the University of California, San Diego, in which 50
<br>
mg a day of DHEA over a 6-month period restored serum levels of DHEA in both
<br>
men and women to youthful ranges. DHEA replacement was associated with an
<br>
increase in perceived physical and psychological well-being for both men
<br>
(67%) and women (84%). Increases in lean body mass and muscle strength were
<br>
reported in men taking 100 mg a day, but this dose appeared to be excessive
<br>
for women.
<br>
<p>DHEA (50 or 100 mg per day) was also shown to significantly elevate insulin
<br>
growth factor (IGF). Aging causes a decline in IGF levels that contributes
<br>
to the loss of lean body mass, as well as to excess fat accumulation,
<br>
neurological impairment and age-associated immune dysfunction.

<br>
<p>DHEA 25 mg capsules
<br>
<p>The Life Extension Foundation sells DHEA that conforms to the following
<br>
specifications:
<br>
<p>99.9% purity (European-derived DHEA)
<br>
<p>Micronized (for maximum absorption and utilization)
<br>
<p>Manufactured under GMP conditions.
<br>
<p>A DHEAS (dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate) blood test should be taken 3-6
<br>
weeks after beginning DHEA therapy to help determine optimal dosing. Some
<br>
people neglect to test their blood levels for DHEA and wind up chronically
<br>
taking the wrong dose. When having your blood tested for DHEA, blood should
<br>
be drawn three to four hours after the last dose. DHEA testing may save you
<br>
money if it shows that you can take less DHEA to maintain youthful DHEA
<br>
serum levels.
<br>
<p>The standard blood test to evaluate DHEA status is one that measures DHEAS.
<br>
The DHEAS is calculated in micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) of blood.
<br>
<p>The youthful ranges of DHEA sulfate are as follows:
<br>
<p>Men     400-560 mcg/deciliter
<br>
Women   350-430 mcg/deciliter
