<p>Ah, but the key perspective is &quot;as long as they do not initiiate
<br>
force against you&quot;.  We are past that point.  They are initiatiating
<br>
force against us in an unextropic perspective that seems to involve
<br>
the support of brain-washed individuals in Afganistan and Pakistan.
<br>
<p><p>### The &quot;brainwashed&quot; Pakistanis???
<br>
<p>What percentage of Afghanis, do you think, are &quot;brainwashed&quot; and eagerly
<br>
waiting to spill some American blood? Is it 100%? Maybe 5%?
<br>
<p>Is it the Afghanis who initiated force, or maybe the Saudis (looking at the
<br>
Wahabbi names on the list of terrorists and the source of their money)? Why
<br>
don't you suggest vaporizing Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Palestine? After all,
<br>
there are hardly any proponents of the Singularity there, whatever it means.
<br>
<p>How many smart and nice Afghanis (there must be some, wouldn't you agree?)
<br>
would you be willing to sacrifice to kill the bad ones?
<br>
<p>I'm really looking forward to some mathematically precise answers.
<br>
<p>Terrorists, and those who instrumentally support them (as opposed to just
<br>
liking the mayhem), can be personally targeted by justice precisely because
<br>
terror is the sacrifice of innocents, for whatever the terrorists think is
<br>
important. Terrorists and their instrumental supporters, and only them, are
<br>
forever defiled by the blood of their victims. Only they may be retaliated
<br>
against, nobody else. In real life there will be always some &quot;collateral
<br>
damage&quot; but it must be kept to the absolute minimum (how to compute that
<br>
minimum is a subject for another post).

I must only say that I am shocked and amazed.  If one cannot voice
on the extropian list thoughts, ideas and opinions that one has
for the maximization of the evolution of our society -- then we
are doomed. 
<p>### Well, at least your post led to a barrage of criticism, showing that
your opinions are not representative of the Extropian attitude.
