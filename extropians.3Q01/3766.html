<p>&lt;&lt; And like the phonograph and the holograph there was a suspicion
<br>
&nbsp;that the recording could be recovered. It would certainly require ingenuity,
<br>
&nbsp;but the important thing was that there would be a natural mechanism that
<br>
&nbsp;could eventually be discovered. &gt;&gt;
<br>
And that's the intriguing part, is there a natural mechanism for this? I can 
<br>
only suppose that there is, and will be looking on the cryogenics list for 
<br>
more info. I may have found one poster who appeared to be physics oriented, 
<br>
if not actually a physicist, so I will see if anything comes of it.
<br>
<p>I am also on the David Deutsch list, which is a lot like Wei Dai's Everything 
<br>
List-both are very dry, and both are Multiple-World oriented. Even when David 
<br>
Deutsch posts himself, its a sleeper (zzzz-zzzzz). Multiple World Theories, 
<br>
as you already know, impose an &quot;immortality&quot; based on &quot;luck&quot; from the 
<br>
observers' persecutive. What we wind up with (eventually) are observers who 
<br>
survive sequentially and exist forever. Mitch¹ dies at one in worldline one, 
<br>
Mitch¹ººººº dies in exponential years. I understand this, but it seems to be 
<br>
too egocentric and antisensical, in the way the world we live in operates. 
<br>
<p>As you've already guessed, I am more interested in a Frank Tipler, or really, 
<br>
Hans Moravec-style re-creation of ourselves, and am suspicious/hopeful, that 
<br>
there may be a better mechanism for restoring the info properly, rather then 
<br>
random logical analysis (however wonderful that truly is!).
