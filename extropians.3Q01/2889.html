<p><p>Lets face it, man is not made to communicate electronically
<br>
<p>Cell phones and e-mail may have become common forms of communication in
<br>
the 21st century, but centuries of evolution have made face-to-face
<br>
communication man?s preferred method, says Dr. Ned Kock, director of the
<br>
E-Collaboration Research Center in Temple University?s Fox School of
<br>
Business and Management.
<br>
<p>&quot;There is a principle from evolution theory called the ?repeated use
<br>
principle,? which argues that we have to repeatedly use a medium of
<br>
communication, an organ, or a task so that our biological apparatus
<br>
becomes optimized to use that tool or perform that task,&quot; says Kock.
<br>
&quot;Since we have communicated during most of the past three to five million
<br>
years by using face-to-face interaction, you have to conclude that we have
<br>
optimized our biological apparatus for that type of communication.
<br>
<p>Kock argues that a lot of today?s electronic communications takes us too
<br>
far away from face-to-face communication, and requires increased cognitive
<br>
effort on our part. &quot;For example, a telephone allows us to use tone of
<br>
voice,&quot; says Kock. &quot;It?s synchronous, so we have immediate feedback on
<br>
what we say.&quot;
<br>
<p>But, Kock points out, since the telephone doesn?t allow one person to see
<br>
the other, a bit more cognitive effort is required when communicating over
<br>
the telephone, as opposed to face-to-face. &quot;Now, if we go to e-mail,
<br>
there?s considerably more cognitive effort required than over the
<br>
telephone,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>Kock did a study in which he compared twenty groups performing complex
<br>
tasks--ten groups interacting by face-to-face, and the other ten via
<br>
e-mail. The study indicates that the amount of time cognitive effort
<br>
(measured as &quot;time&quot;) required to convey a certain number of ideas via
<br>
email is between 5 and 15 times than required to convey the same ideas in
<br>
a face-to-face conversation.
<br>
<p>&quot;In a typical conversation, we exchange hundreds, maybe thousands, of
<br>
words. If you measure the time it takes for that conversation to take
<br>
place, and then try to have the same conversation over e-mail and measure
<br>
the time that takes, you would get a time that is considerably higher than
<br>
the face-to-face conversation,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>Kock contends that it is our innate schemas that make us view it as more
<br>
difficult to communicate through any medium other than face-to-face. &quot;We
<br>
have optimized our biological communication apparatus for face-to-face
<br>
communications,&quot; he continues. &quot;As we move away from it, the more
<br>
cognitive effort is needed.&quot;
<br>
<p>Man?s ability to learn, which is the highest in the animal kingdom, may
<br>
eventually serve as a counterbalance to our predisposition to use
<br>
face-to-face communications.
<br>
<p>&quot;In other words, if we use e-mail for very complex communications for
<br>
many, many years, and we avoid face-to-face communications, obviously,
<br>
we?re going to become good at using e-mail for that type of
<br>
communications,&quot;  says Kock. &quot;But our predisposition toward face-to-face
<br>
communications won?t go entirely away.&quot;
<br>
<p>Where is this leading us? Kock believes to the point that we are trying to
<br>
make electronic communications as close to face-to-face as we can.
<br>
<p>He points out that some successful online companies like LivePerson.com
<br>
are developing technologies that give a company?s online customers the
<br>
impression that they?re dealing with a live person over the Web.
<br>
<p>&quot;What is the reason for that?&quot; questions Kock. &quot;The reason is because we
<br>
tend to spend less cognitive effort in communications activities when we
<br>
have face-to-face like interactions. Even if those face-to-face-like
<br>
interactions are virtual.&quot;
