WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Economists said a global economic contraction was
<br>
almost assured as world stock markets plunged, the U.S. dollar spiraled lower
<br>
against the yen and euro, and oil and gold prices soared after terror attacks
<br>
on landmarks in New York and near Washington.
<br>
<p>Analysts speculated the catastrophic events could deal a hammer blow to U.S.
<br>
confidence and could send already wary investors fleeing to gold and other
<br>
assets which benefit in uncertain times.
<br>
<p>President Bush said in a televised address to the nation that the world's
<br>
richest economy would carry on despite what he called ``evil, despicable acts
<br>
of terror.''
<br>
<p>``Our financial institutions remain strong and the American economy will be
<br>
open for business as well,'' Bush said.
<br>
<p>For years the United States has been seen by investors everywhere as a safe
<br>
haven -- a place where trillions of dollars could be invested, offering
<br>
returns typically better than those available in Europe and elsewhere.
<br>
<p>But terrorist attacks that caused both towers of the World Trade Center to
<br>
collapse and left the U.S. Pentagon in flames could have a devastating effect
<br>
on confidence in the U.S. economy, which was already teetering on the
<br>
precipice of recession, economists said.
<br>
<p>Markets were shut across the United States, which attracts almost two-thirds
<br>
of all global capital flows, in the wake of the attacks and were to remain
<br>
closed on Wednesday.
<br>
<p>This added to the uncertainty about how American markets would react to the
<br>
tragedy.
<br>
<p>``A full-blown global recession is highly likely,' said Sung Won Sohn, chief
<br>
economist at Wells Fargo (news/quote) &amp; Co. in Minneapolis.
<br>
<p>``Recently, the economy has been on a high wire act, straddling between a
<br>
recession and an anemic growth;damage to confidence will push us into a
<br>
recession,'' he said.
<br>
<p>HELP BEING READIED
<br>
The world's major central banks issued statements saying they stood ready to
<br>
act to counter any potential market turmoil.
<br>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve said it was open and operating and that its discount
<br>
window would provide liquidity as necessary -- a tacit admission that it
<br>
stands ready in crisis mode. Federal Reserve Bank of New York President
<br>
William McDonough, speaking in Switzerland, said the U.S. central bank would,
<br>
''provide that liquidity which is needed.''
<br>
<p>Later, the European Central Bank said it also stood ready to provide liquidity
<br>
to keep financial markets functioning.
<br>
<p>Japan's Ministry of Finance said it had provided extra liquidity after the
<br>
U.S. attacks and that it stands ready to take appropriate foreign exchange
<br>
actions as needed.
<br>
<p>The Nikkei stock index in Tokyo opened Wednesday's trading sharply lower,
<br>
plumbing levels not seen in 17 years and losing more than 6 percent.
<br>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, who was traveling in Tokyo, sought to
<br>
reassure markets, saying he has every confidence in the financial system's
<br>
ability to weather the latest challenge.
<br>
<p>``Our nation's financial markets are strong and resilient,'' O'Neill said in a
<br>
statement issued from Japan, where he will remain until further notice.
<br>
<p>``In the face of today's tragedy, the financial system functioned
<br>
extraordinarily well, and I have every confidence that it will continue to do
<br>
so in the days ahead,'' he said.
<br>
<p>The closure of markets on Wednesday will mark only the second time the New
<br>
York Stock Exchange has shut for two consecutive days, the last being in honor
<br>
of the end of World War Two in August of 1945.
<br>
<p>Economists said there could be untold damage to the U.S. financial system,
<br>
noting many key stock market players in the World Trade Center buildings were
<br>
likely killed.
<br>
<p>Sohn said he expects a ``stampede'' of sell orders once American stock markets
<br>
reopen, and a run on insurance companies, possibly crippling the financial
<br>
system and forcing the U.S. Fed to cut interest rates even further.
<br>
<p>The Fed has already cut rates seven times this year by a total of three full
<br>
percentage points to try to reignite sputtering economic growth.
<br>
<p>GLOBAL RECESSION?
<br>
The unprecedented assault on key symbols of U.S. military and financial might
<br>
came as growth around the globe slows to a crawl. The U.S. economy is barely
<br>
growing, Europe's is slowing rapidly and Japan's actually contracted in the
<br>
second quarter.
<br>
<p>Kevin Logan, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in New York summed
<br>
up the feelings of many, saying Tuesday's events meant, ``it won't be business
<br>
as usual'' anymore.
<br>
<p>``People will begin to invest and spend less as they try to determine what the
<br>
future will bring. I can only imagine the stock market is very vulnerable,''
<br>
he said.
<br>
<p>Before the attacks, the International Monetary Fund had expected global growth
<br>
of just 2.7 percent this year, down from almost 5 percent last year, with the
<br>
risk of a global recession rising -- the top item on the agenda at the
<br>
upcoming meeting of leading industrial nations in Washington later this month.
<br>
<p>Economists said the worst-case scenario could be a massive capital flight out
<br>
of U.S. assets -- something that could crush already weak U.S. stock prices
<br>
and banish the American economy into its first recession in more than a
<br>
decade.
<br>
<p>``The major risk is panic in the financial markets,'' said Kathryn Kobe, an
<br>
economist at Joel Popkin &amp; Co. in Washington. ''If for some reason the United
<br>
States is no longer seen as a safe haven for capital...there could be some
<br>
very large capital movements.''
<br>
<p>Oil prices, regarded as one of the culprits behind the slowdown that began
<br>
late last year, spiked more than 10 percent on Tuesday before closing up
<br>
nearly 6 percent on the day at a over $29 a barrel -- a shift eyed nervously
<br>
by analysts, who said higher oil prices would also hamper economic growth.
<br>
<p>Parts of the U.S. economy, notably the manufacturing sector, are already in
<br>
recession. But consumers have remained confident, helping prop up the broader
<br>
economy. However, economists said that faith will be rocked by Tuesday's
<br>
events.
<br>
<p>And the tumble in stock prices -- if sustained when the New York stock market
<br>
eventually reopens -- could further injure confidence and spending, which in
<br>
the United States has remained intact in the face of the slowdown.
<br>
<p>The U.S. economy grew only 0.2 percent in the second quarter and analysts
<br>
feared that the attacks could finally turn that paltry growth rate negative.

<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
