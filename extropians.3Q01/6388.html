<em>&gt; &gt; The way to get rid of terrorism against us is to make the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would say the repercussions are already on that level. The problem is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the sane terrorists, it is the insane ones. No threat whatsoever can
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; also the production of strong resistance, which will come back and haunt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you later.
</em><br>
<p>What repurcussions?  We have been attacked abroad over and over
<br>
again with only token response.  We have done nothing thus far
<br>
on this latest and far more escalated attack.  The repurcussions
<br>
may not stop the insane but they will certainly give great pause
<br>
to those who arm, feed, shelter, supply and aim the suicidal at
<br>
us.  Beyond that if they are truly beyond reason completely and
<br>
beyond constraint then they deserve to be hunted down like the
<br>
deranged and dangerous fiends that you are declaring that they
<br>
are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is worth thinking of game theory here: you need a strategy that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promotes trust and cooperation, while discourages defection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The game Tuesday was little but strike hard and fast and dare
<br>
the other side to respond at all.  If they do not then strike
<br>
even harder next time.  Gather all the glory for boldly
<br>
emasculating and harming the Great Satan in its lair.  This
<br>
cannot be allowed to go unpunished and or underpunished.  That
<br>
would be to forfeit. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There is no way a free, individual rights afffirming, secular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government could help but piss off those countries and inviduals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of very different mindset.  Our very existence pisses them off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There is no way to appease such.  We can only make clear that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when they attack us we will respond as to an act of war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have heard the term &quot;act of war&quot; bandied around so much the last days
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I fully expect that it will now lose any meaning except outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal circles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The old terminology of conflict needs new words to deal with &quot;war&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between nations, groups and individuals. It is not just for nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anymore.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>There are real nations supporting and cheering such actions. 
<br>
Nations that have made real threats to us and our citizens and
<br>
who have trained and cultivated terrorists and used them against
<br>
us.  Iran and Afghanistan are two such nations.  
<br>
<p>It is not a figure of speech in the least.  We have been
<br>
viciously attacked and will respond to this true act of war. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; In short we are largely hate for our good before we are hated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for any actual evil we have, may have or will commit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a way, yes. The US gets distrusted because of its power, and every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single move that can be criticised or viewed as evil will be used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support the anti-american view. So before you rush off to decisively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retailiate against an enemy, think of the long term effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Discouraging future attacks should be the main goal, and this depends on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) how discouraged people get by seeing what happens to attackers, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) how angry people get by seeing what the US does. There is a balance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to strike here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The long term effect of playing it diplomatic and making only
<br>
token response is screaming from all communication channels. 
<br>
Such responses over decades led directly to the events of
<br>
Tuesday.  I want to do more than &quot;discourage&quot; future attacks.  I
<br>
want to remove the groups who are the threat and the governments
<br>
who support such threats.   They can be angry but they will
<br>
respect us or else.  We are not the aggressor.  They are.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The way to deal with the general problem is of course to deal with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; root cause. We need to make people see the good aspects of the US - by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promoting open societies, by allowing other countries to participate in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trade, open borders and so on. To a large extent this is what has worked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well for the US, but it is important to make people in general see this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and avoid closing down trade, borders and societies out of fear of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>When we do many of these things we are hated for our &quot;cultural
<br>
imperialism&quot;.  We are hated as a clear threat to those who would
<br>
rule by an Iron hand of fundamentalist law in a backwards
<br>
theocracy.  We are hated by those who love the familiar, despite
<br>
its relative misery, more than progress and freedom. 
<br>
<p>I agree that we should not become a closed society.  But we also
<br>
cannot be a soceity if we allow others to attack us and ours
<br>
with relative impunity.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; There will always be opponents, rational or not, but when whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies embrace openness they will have a harder time getting help,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hiding and gaining converts.  No amount of military intervention can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever achieve that to the same extent. At least not without turning the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US into exactly what people fear it might be.
</em><br>
<p>Whole societies will not embrace openness just out of
<br>
enlightened self-interest.  I wish it were so but it is not. 
<br>
Some societies are in the way of their people's being able to
<br>
choose anything at all and attack directly other societies who
<br>
are open.  When they attack us they will be brought low.  This
<br>
is simple and deadly logic than even the most willfully blind
<br>
cannot escape seeing.  If, that is, we do not pretend the world
<br>
and those behind Tuesdays events, are other than what they are. 
<br>
<p>The US has too long been interested in opinion polls more than
<br>
the defense and integrity of its own people.   This needs to
<br>
end.
