<em>&gt; &gt; Did *anyone* on this list vote for the current president/government

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good point.  Extropians are not the only ones (not imputing that Charlie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stross said this - he did not) who are not herd animals (e.g., most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people I've known in my life have been liberals, but do not exhibit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;copycat&quot; traits).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having been around freethinkers (nontheist variety) for a couple of decades,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've heard them explain: &quot;you can't herd atheists ...&quot; (usually, when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consensus can't be reached, and therefore policy can't be established,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resulting in yet another splinter group, and another, and another - each one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smaller than the previous, each with their own distinctive un-herd-like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; features).  Naturally occurring nanolunkhead nontechnology, you might say.
</em><br>
<p>Except of course, that those remaining in the groups adhere, quite
<br>
herdlike, to the dictated doctrine, and always have a base set of
<br>
assumed doctrine that is common to all. Conversely, those of us who are
<br>
more libertarian don't mind consorting with people who differ on a
<br>
number of issues (Except, of course, for those pesky Objectivists ;) ).
<br>
How is a hundred herd-like groups any different from one? Of course,
<br>
with the fewer leaders in a large group, its far easier to identify who
<br>
it is that needs a smack upside the head.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Granted that Extropycats don't follow the herd.  But, then again, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; un-herd-like behavior its own herd-like behavior?  That is to say, are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropians gathering under the Black Sheep Uncolaition? [I've deliberately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misspelled that last word - reference is to a couple of old soft drink
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commercials, not the word &quot;coalition.&quot;]
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that any herd behavior is per se wrong. What is wrong is
<br>
to impose consequences for un-herd-like behavior. Whether it is
<br>
ostracizing someone who differs with you on a small point of doctrine
<br>
despite formerly being a close friend, or else putting them up against
<br>
the wall and shooting them, this is the real sin commited by some herds.
<br>
The old 'resistance is futile, you will be assimilated' mantra is the
<br>
turn-off.
