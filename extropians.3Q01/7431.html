<p>Florida Executive Order - Marshall Law
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just some quick facts (no rumors what-so-ever) concerning the Bush family
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;brothers, Governor &quot;Jeb&quot; of Florida and President &quot;G.W.&quot; of Washington
<br>
&nbsp;City, with regards to the events of 9-11:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday, September 7, &quot;Jeb&quot; signed Florida Executive Order No. 01-261 which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;states, in part:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I hereby delegate to The Adjutant General of the State of Florida all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary authority, within approved budgetary appropriations or grants,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to order members of the Florida National Guard into active service, as
<br>
defined
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by Section 250.27, Florida Statutes, for the purpose of training to
<br>
support
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;law-enforcement personnel and emergency-management personnel in the event
<br>
of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;civil disturbances or natural disasters and to provide training support to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;law-enforcement personnel and community-based organizations relating to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;counter drug operations. This Executive Order shall remain in full force
<br>
&nbsp;and effect until the earlier of its revocation or June 30, 2003.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This Fla. EO places the Florida National Guard, a unit of the Federal U.S.
<br>
Army, in control of all Florida law
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;enforcement (State FDLE, County Sheriffs, and local PD's) and the Florida
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Emergency Management department (Florida's FEMA under federal FEMA
<br>
&nbsp;control) Remember, this was 4 days before the WTC disaster.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Governor &quot;Jeb&quot; then signed Florida Executive Order No. 01-262 immediately
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;after the second WTC tower fell.  Florida was the first STATE to declare a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;State of Emergency&quot; and did so before New York State or the Federal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Washington City leaders did, yet there were no &quot;terroristic&quot; incidents
<br>
that had taken place in Florida.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Florida EO 01-262 states, in part:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I hereby declare that a state of emergency exists in the State of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Florida... The authority to suspend the effect of any statute or rule
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;governing the conduct of state business, and the further authority to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;suspend the effect of any order or rule of any governmental entity... The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;authority to seize and utilize any and all real or personal property as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;needed to meet this emergency... The authority to order the evacuation of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;any or all persons from any location in the State of Florida, and the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;authority to regulate the movement of any or all persons to or from any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;location in the State; The authority to regulate the return of the
<br>
&nbsp;evacuees to their home communities... I hereby order the Adjutant General
<br>
to
<br>
&nbsp;activate the Florida National Guard for the duration of this emergency.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no declared expiration of this Florida Executive Order.  In case
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you haven't figured it out yet, Florida is now under martial law and will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;remain so until this EO is revoked.  The people of Florida were warned
<br>
&nbsp;about this in 1998 when their State Constitution was changed to allow this
<br>
to
<br>
&nbsp;take place, but no-one listened. See &quot;Martial Law Now Legal in Florida&quot; at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://209.123.142.199/lawgiver/flaconst.asp">http://209.123.142.199/lawgiver/flaconst.asp</a> .
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you plan on vacationing in Florida, (or if, unfortunately, you live in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Florida), remember that you have entered into a  Martial Law State under
<br>
the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;control of the Washington City &quot;brothers&quot; and federal troops. It appears
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that &quot;2001 is not a space odyssey&quot; it is &quot;deja vu - 1865&quot;.

<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;EXECUTIVE ORDER NUMBER
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;01-261
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Florida National Guard has the statutory responsibility to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;provide support to law-enforcement personnel and emergency-management
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;personnel in the event of civil disturbances or natural disasters; and
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Florida National Guard has the responsibility to provide
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;training support to law-enforcement personnel and community-based
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;organizations relating to counter drug operations; and
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Florida National Guard must train to meet such
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;responsibilities; and
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Florida National Guard is funded for any such training by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;budgetary appropriation or grants before any such training; and
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Florida National Guard must conduct such training in active
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;service of the state, as defined by Section 250.27, Florida Statutes (also
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;known as active military service and state active duty) for members of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Florida National Guard to be covered by Section 250.34, Florida Statutes;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, as Governor, I may delegate the authority contained in Section
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;250.06(4), Florida Statutes, to order training to help respond to civil
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;disturbances, natural disasters, and counter drug operations to The
<br>
&nbsp;Adjutant
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;General of the State of Florida; and
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the State of Florida that I
<br>
&nbsp;delegate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;such authority, so that the Florida National Guard is adequately trained
<br>
&nbsp;to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;meet its obligation to help respond to civil disturbances, natural
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;disasters, and counter drug operations and so that members of the Florida
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;National Guard performing such training are covered by Section 250.34,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Florida Statutes; and
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Governor may order the Florida National Guard to provide
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;extraordinary support to law enforcement upon request and such a request
<br>
&nbsp;has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;been received from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;assist FDLE in performing port security training and inspections.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, I, JEB BUSH, as Governor of Florida, by virtue of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;authority vested in me by Article IV, Section 1(a) of the Florida
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Constitution, and by Section 250.06(4), Florida Statutes, and all other
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;applicable laws, do hereby promulgate the following Executive Order, to
<br>
&nbsp;take
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;immediate effect:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 1.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon the foregoing, I hereby find that the public welfare requires
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Florida National Guard train to support law-enforcement personnel
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and emergency-management personnel in the event of civil disturbances or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;natural disasters and to provide training support to law-enforcement
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;personnel and community-based organizations relating to counter drug
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;operations.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 2.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I hereby delegate to The Adjutant General of the State of Florida all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary authority, within approved budgetary appropriations or grants,
<br>
&nbsp;to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;order members of the Florida National Guard into active service, as
<br>
&nbsp;defined
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by Section 250.27, Florida Statutes, for the purpose of training to
<br>
&nbsp;support
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;law-enforcement personnel and emergency-management personnel in the event
<br>
&nbsp;of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;civil disturbances or natural disasters and to provide training support to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;law-enforcement personnel and community-based organizations relating to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;counter drug operations.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Florida National Guard may order selected members on to state active
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;duty for service to the State of Florida pursuant to Section 250.06(4),
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Florida Statutes, to assist FDLE in performing port security training and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;inspections. Based on the potential massive damage to life and property
<br>
&nbsp;that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;may result from an act of terrorism at a Florida port, the necessity to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;protect life and property from such acts of terrorism, and inhibiting the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;smuggling of illegal drugs into the State of Florida, the use of the
<br>
&nbsp;Florida
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;National Guard to support FDLE in accomplishing port security training and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;inspections is &quot;extraordinary support to law enforcement&quot; as used in
<br>
&nbsp;Section
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;250.06(4), Florida Statutes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adjutant General shall not place members of the Florida National Guard
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;into active service for longer than necessary to accomplish the purposes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;declared herein.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This Executive Order supersedes Executive Order Number 01-17. Executive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Order Number 01-17 is hereby revoked.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This Executive Order shall remain in full force and effect until the
<br>
&nbsp;earlier
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of its revocation or June 30, 2003.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and have caused the
<br>
&nbsp;Great
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seal of the State of Florida to be affixed at Tallahassee, the Capitol,
<br>
&nbsp;this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;7th day of September 2001.

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;EXECUTIVE ORDER NUMBER
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;01-262
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Emergency Management)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, on September 11, 2001 a combination of persons unknown carried
<br>
&nbsp;out
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a series of terrorist acts resulting in the destruction of the World Trade
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Center in New York City and an explosion at the Pentagon, costing the
<br>
&nbsp;lives
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of many persons and resulting in injuries to many more; and
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the scale of the destruction and the coordination, orchestration,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and timing evident in these acts of terrorism suggest that they may be
<br>
&nbsp;part
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of a larger pattern of acts of terrorism; and
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, I, JEB BUSH, as Governor of Florida, by virtue of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;authority vested in me by Article IV, Section 1(a) of the Florida
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Constitution and by the Florida Emergency Management Act, as amended, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;all other applicable laws, do hereby promulgate the following Executive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Order, to take immediate effect:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 1.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the foregoing conditions, I hereby declare that a state of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;emergency exists in the State of Florida. I further find that the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;precautions needed to protect the State from a recurrence of such
<br>
&nbsp;terrorist
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;acts require a coordination of efforts by a number of agencies, and that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;central authority over these activities will be needed to ensure such
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;coordination.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 2.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I hereby delegate to the Department of Law Enforcement the operational
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;authority to coordinate and direct the law enforcement resources and other
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;resources of any and all state, regional and local governmental agencies
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Department may designate to take the precautions needed to
<br>
&nbsp;protect
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the State of Florida from terrorist acts. I hereby place all law
<br>
&nbsp;enforcement
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;resources under the operational authority of the Department of Law
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Enforcement while this Executive Order remains in effect, and I hereby
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;designate the Commissioner of the Department of Law Enforcement as
<br>
&nbsp;Incident
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Commander for this emergency.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I hereby designate the Interim Director of the Division of Emergency
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Management as the State Coordinating Officer for the duration of this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;emergency, and as my Authorized Representative. In exercising the powers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;delegated by this Executive Order, the State Coordinating Officer shall
<br>
&nbsp;lend
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;all available operational support to the Commissioner of the Department of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Law Enforcement, and shall confer with the Governor to the fullest extent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;practicable. In accordance with Sections 252.36(1)(a) and 252.36(5),

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of any order or rule of any governmental entity, to include, without
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;limiting the generality of the foregoing, any and all statutes and rules
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which affect budgeting, printing, purchasing, leasing, procurement, and

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The authority to direct all state, regional and local governmental
<br>
&nbsp;agencies,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;including law enforcement agencies, to identify personnel needed from
<br>
&nbsp;those
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;agencies to assist in meeting the needs created by this emergency, and to

&nbsp;this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;emergency to the extent that literal compliance with such statutes, rules,

&nbsp;&nbsp;and orders may be inconsistent with the timely performance of emergency
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;response functions.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I hereby give all agencies with employees certified by the American Red
