Oh oh, this one slipped by me.  Lee, never mind about George and affirmative
<br>
action, you've answered here, and I thank you.

I've never
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can't force me to take resp-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; onsibility for acts committed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other people who look like me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's really &quot;guilt by association&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not trying to force you to take responsibility for something you have
<br>
not done personally.  If you live in the U.S.A., you are profiting from some
<br>
the prosperity which is still tricking down to us from slave labor (by
<br>
institutions built by slave labor, by companies which have direct and
<br>
indirect ties to the prosperity of companies which operated on slave labor,
<br>
including stocks).  Because of your white skin (I am assuming this) you are
<br>
&quot;automatically&quot; privileged in many ways.  I'm not saying you should feel
<br>
guilty, but I am suggesting that maybe you can feel some compassion for a
<br>
situation that was created - not by you or me, granted - but that exists,
<br>
nevertheless, and is sad beyond words (a sadness which has reverberated for
<br>
hundreds of years, a sadness for many blacks which is still cruelly real
<br>
today).
<br>
<p>After all, the USA has given reparations for Jews, and to the Japanese.  But
<br>
slavery - which existed for so much longer and was unprecedented in its
<br>
cruelty, dealing with selling human beings like chattel - no talk of
<br>
reparations, no memorials, hardly any acknowledgment.  Of course, all the
<br>
people who dealt directly with slavery are gone, but we are still a
<br>
prosperous nation, and we can afford to say &quot;thank you,&quot; and &quot;we're sorry
<br>
for what was done to you,&quot; and acknowledge the contributions made by slaves.
<br>
<p>Olga: &gt; &gt; .. if you don't think that that may just be one of the
<br>
contributing reasons why &quot;not all
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; groups are exactly equal to all other groups in every way ...&quot;
</em><br>
Lee: &gt; But I do believe that it was a
<br>
<em>&gt; contributing factor.
</em><br>
Olga:  But who's responsible for
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this state of affairs?
</em><br>
Lee:&gt; Not me.
<br>
<p>No comment.
<br>
<p>Olga
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; And think about this:  if whites had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gone through what blacks had to go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; through for those hundreds of years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our &quot;pecking&quot; order may have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in reverse order at this stage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the game.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no doubt about it.  Color
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of skin can't be magical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; One thing you never responded to, Lee, and that was my quip about
</em><br>
George W.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Bush.  Even though I was being sarcastic, it was still a serious
</em><br>
question.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I read loud and clear that you are opposed to affirmative action.  But,
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; see, we have affirmative action for white people (that's what I meant
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; imply when I said that George W. Bush is an Affirmative Action Baby
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; (&quot;AAB&quot;)).  Why aren't you opposed to affirmative action for white
</em><br>
people?
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Did George W. Bush get into the White House on his own merit?  Or is he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; (gasp ... groan ... slap on forehead!) an ... AAB?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Affirmative action, in the case of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education, means including people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of one group at the expense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people of another group who have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher scores, simply because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people in the first group have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wrong skin color, or other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethnic/religious identity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am opposed to affirmative action for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; white people.  (E.g., at Berkeley, where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going just by scores, 60% of the students
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be Chinese, even though they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only 7% of the population.)  I am opposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to affirmative action for any group.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; George W. Bush may have been favored
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of his father's influence, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that he may have had other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantages independent of his ability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Please take that sentence literally---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every word counts.  Please don't read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any more into it than is there. Thanks.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But since he was not discriminated for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or against in his admission to college
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of his group (i.e., race, eth-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nicity, or religious background) I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see why you would call that affirmative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action.  Moreover, &quot;AA&quot; is a policy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implemented in the U.S. for the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time in the 1960's.  I do not think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite correct to say that because Jews
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were discriminated against, in the 1920s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for college admission, that there was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a policy of affirmative action in favor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of whites; it's simply true that Jews
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were discriminated *against*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The words &quot;affirmative action&quot; came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from government bureaucrats who came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up with a euphemism for &quot;favoring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people of one particular race at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expense of other people&quot;.  It was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later broadened to mean &quot;favoring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people of any race besides caucasian&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, no, George W. Bush is not an AAB,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; despite his many &quot;unfair&quot; advantages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thank you for actually quoting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question that I had omitted to answer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
