From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20NEWS:%20Ageing%20recession%20warning&In-Reply-To=&lt;008201c13182$957ea8e0$835c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Of course, economics in the middle to late century will also be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affected by other factors such as whether AI enables largescale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automation
</em><br>
<p>Large scale automation in the private sector has resulted in government bloat,
<br>
as displaced workers help to ratchet up bureaucratic fiefdoms. If government
<br>
is _not_ automated to the degree private industry has been, accelerating AI
<br>
becomes more susceptible to assimilation by military forces, because unlike
<br>
government, the armed forces energetically pursue the replacement of personnel
<br>
with machines. The military has a particularly effective anti-ageing treatment
<br>
that it refers to as &quot;termination with extreme prejudice.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Notice that nobody has said that maybe the retirement age ought to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; move up. So beside anti-aging treatments we might need anti-pension
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatments :-)
</em><br>
<p>Been there, done that. It's called inflation without cost of living
<br>
adjustments -- also an effective anti-ageing treatment, as it replaces older
<br>
workers with younger ones (the older workers disappear, nobody knows where
<br>
they go).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The old have much money invested in long-term investments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as pension funds, which might mean a tendency for capital to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more risk-aversive.
</em><br>
beside anti-aging treatments we might need anti-pension
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the first world enters ageing recessions, it is very likely that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least parts of the third world can capitalize greatly on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relative youth of their populations. And it is if course a great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument for opening up borders and allowing immigration - it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very likely the US is going to remain the economic powerhouse of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy if the predictions this article makes come true, simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thanks to the relatively high immigration.
</em><br>
<p>Just the opposite will happen when young biotech scientists in the US emigrate
<br>
to countries which do not limit stem cell research, and these emigrants are
<br>
replaced by immigrant farm laborers, unskilled workers, and fugitives from
<br>
across the border. Socio-economic upheaval predicted by savvy futurists (which
<br>
outdistance the predictions this article makes) argues for rational
<br>
consideration of the decline of nations and the continued rise of
<br>
technologically protected corporate entities. This is more extropic than the
<br>
alternative, viz., runaway escalation of industrial-military AI to protect the
<br>
assets of aging wealthy families, pensioned politicians, and the faith-based
<br>
establishment.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
