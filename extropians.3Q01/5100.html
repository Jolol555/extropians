J.R. said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Ideas that are good enough to have persuaded _you_ of their worth ought to
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt;good enough to stand on their own &lt;snip&gt; without being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bolstered by association with social democrat/ic politics. What makes an
</em><br>
idea
<br>
<em>&gt;a &quot;liberal&quot; idea, as opposed to being an idea that promotes health,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prosperity, beauty, freedom, practicality, excellence, and competence?
</em><br>
AFAIC,
<br>
<em>&gt;really good ideas transcend the left/right, liberal/conservative
</em><br>
dichotomies,
<br>
<em>&gt;so calling an idea &quot;liberal&quot; is no worse than calling one &quot;conservative.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I entirely agree. I'd be happy to second the proposal that we all work on
<br>
such a basis.
<br>
<p>My probem is that the word &quot;liberal&quot; gets used as an insult or a put-down,
<br>
as in &quot;liberal schmalz&quot; (which was what I reacted to), especially when
<br>
people are arguing with Olga or Miriam. I guess Olga and Miriam can look
<br>
after themselves, but there is this tendency on the list to suggest that
<br>
people like them are wrong *because* of their liberal qualities. There
<br>
sometimes seems to be a background assumption that social demcratic ideas
<br>
ipso facto lack legitimacy.
<br>
<p>This *may* be because some of the leaders of the extropian movement have
<br>
strong libertarian views, but I don't see any necessary connection when I
<br>
read the extropian principles.
<br>
