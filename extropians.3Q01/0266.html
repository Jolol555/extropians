<em>&gt; &gt;I would hazard to guess -- but confess ignorance here:) -- that, in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;past, most fires, too were small and contained.  It wasn't like London
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;burned done once a decade.  You make it sound as if it did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What we would need to do is find out if government fire codes have had the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;impact you believe they have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When towns were built mainly of wood large fires were common (ie up to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 17th century). They became much less frequent as other materials were more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widely used. However this didn't require government fire regulation codes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same effect was achieved by insurers and by the use of restrictive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; covenants in building leases which stipulated that materials such as brick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or stone be used in any construction. (The insurers also had their own fire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engine sevices, interestingly). So this was achieved by voluntary agreement,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as you say. 
</em><br>
<p>However, there is far more to building codes than just fire prevention:
<br>
earthquake, flood, hurricane, as well as simple accident prevention. The
<br>
building and fire codes that your local governments institute are not
<br>
conjured out of thin air. In fact, the original fire codes were, in
<br>
fact, instituted by insurance company fire chiefs and building
<br>
inspectors. Today, non governmental groups like the ICBO (International
<br>
Conference of Building Officials), BOCA, etc meet regularly to refine
<br>
their codes, which are called 'model codes': they have no weight of law,
<br>
but insurance companies rely on them, and most all state, county, and
<br>
local governments base their own building and fire codes on these model
<br>
codes, revising their own codes every 4-12 years as the groups issue new
<br>
versions with changes that have been debated and voted on by the members
<br>
from all over the country and the world.
<br>
<p>These codes are not instituted by fiat, they are not promulgated out of
<br>
thin air. They are typically studied with detailed scientific
<br>
experiments, with reports issued and significant peer review done before
<br>
conclusions are drawn and proposed code changes are written based upon
<br>
the newest research.
<br>
<p>I suggest that those interested in this attend an ICBO meeting (or one
<br>
of any other building code group). Subscribe to their publications,
<br>
which are as detailed as any scholarly journal.
