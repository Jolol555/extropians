</em><br>
<p>I think there is an important difference between cybergnosticism as I
<br>
described it and simply accepting uploading as a good idea. We all seem to
<br>
agree that being digital and movable is a more practical form of existence
<br>
for human flourishing than being tied to a certain computational matrix. But
<br>
do you view the material world as something inherently bad, and the uploaded
<br>
state as inherently good? A cybergnostic would do this, although many people
<br>
who are in practice cybergnostics have not thought through these issues very
<br>
carefully and simply reflexively say that uploading is good. Once you start
<br>
to pick at the question *why* uploading is a good thing, then much of
<br>
cybergnosticism evaporates.
