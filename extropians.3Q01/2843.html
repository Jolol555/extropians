<em>&gt; A couple food stamps and a bottle of ripple.
</em><br>
<p>I've spent 4 years as lurker on this list and this is the most viciously
<br>
racist comment I've ever seen, although I've seen a lot that is offensive
<br>
from Mr Lorry this tops them all. I tend to agree with Alex Bokovs analysis
<br>
of how this list operates, what he misses is that so-called libertarianism
<br>
dogmatism and rigidity quickly descends into intolerance and bigotry as we
<br>
are now seeing.
