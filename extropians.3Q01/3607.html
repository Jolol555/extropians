Urgent need to ban cloning, say NZ advisers
<br>
<p>CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand, Aug 9 (AFP) -
<br>
Foreign researchers could attempt to clone a human in New Zealand unless
<br>
legislation banning the practice is put in place urgently, the Independent
<br>
Biotechnology Advisory Councilwarned Thursday.
<br>
<p>The group advises the government on science issues.
<br>
<p>The caution follows the announcement by an Italian doctor, Severino
<br>
Antinori, that he plans to begin the process of creating cloned babies for
<br>
infertile couples by November.
<br>
<p>Antinori gained worldwide notice by helping a 62-year-old woman have a child
<br>
in 1994 with the aid of artificial insemination.
<br>
<p>IBAC chairwoman Anne Dickinson said legislation was urgently needed.
<br>
<p>&quot;If we don't put legislation in place we become a target country for people
<br>
to do things they're not allowed to do in their own countries,&quot; she warned.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's a big issue overseas and New Zealand is just catching up.&quot;
<br>
<p>The shape of New Zealand legislation would depend on how people saw the
<br>
ethical issues.
<br>
<p>&quot;If they regard an embryo as human life, that is just the same as you or me,
<br>
then they won't want that sort of research. If they see it simply as a ball
<br>
of cells, then they will take a different view,&quot; Dickinson said.
<br>
<p>A spokesman for Attorney-General Margaret Wilson said the government had yet
<br>
to take a position on the issue.
<br>
<p>It would make a decision this month on two bills dealing with human cloning
<br>
that were being considered in select committee, the spokesman said.
<br>
<p>One of the bills is government backbencher Dianne Yates' Human Assisted
<br>
Reproductive Technology Bill, which has languished in select committee since
<br>
<p>Yates also said there was great urgency to pass a law and that Antinori
<br>
could attempt to clone a human in New Zealand next month under the present
<br>
regime.
<br>
<p>&quot;At the moment the health select committee is totally preoccupied and bound
<br>
up with cannabis,&quot; Yates said.
<br>
<p>&quot;I think the future of the human race is more important and am hoping more
<br>
urgency will be given to this matter. The brave new world is upon us.&quot;
