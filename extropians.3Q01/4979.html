<em>&gt;From: &quot;Randy Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:randysmith101@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20US%20Science%20Education%20Sucks&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108260439.f7Q4dCB16405@pheidippides.md.chalmers.se&gt;">randysmith101@hotmail.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Please humor me and my ignorance of the details involved, I will ask a lot
<br>
of questions in trying to understand the situation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Actually, the immigration of all those mexican peasants does indeed matter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to us all, especially those of us who are planning to be frozen if old age 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aint cured pretty soon.  The substantial MAJORITY of immigrants, mexicans or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;otherwise, are &quot;peasants.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I would expect a majority, but is it SO marked? I'd expected a lot of
<br>
poor urban dwellers with low-skill job abilities would be a big component
<br>
of immigration. They are probably more aware of the potential benefits of
<br>
going to the US than a peasant, or so I would imagine in my ignorance,
<br>
and extrapolating from what I've seen in the emigration patterns of Argentina
<br>
and neighbouring countries.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From my observations, peasants don't run much of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a country. Mainly, they live in kleptocracies. I don't want the USA to be a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kleptocracy. I doubt cryonics would be legal for the common man in the USA 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were uneducated peasants to abound in the USA.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, they live in kleptocracies. But they suffer the abuses, instead of
<br>
benefitting from them. Given that, I can't imagine why would they feel
<br>
inclined to create a kleptocracy in the US. They may lack a lot of
<br>
sophisticated political ideas and practice, but they should be able to
<br>
recognize kleptocracy is a no win game for them. Were they benefitting
<br>
from it, wouldn't they just stay in their countries? Also, how would
<br>
the uneducated peasants keep you from enjoying cryonics? I thought those
<br>
of them that are illegals wouldn't be able to vote or such, and those
<br>
who can, well I just can't see them worrying much about the issue one
<br>
way or another...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Another thing, no one really invited them, except those that make money from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them, and that is really the minority in the USA. YOu say my own ancestors 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were immigrants, too? That is a non sequitir: I may own a house, and at some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point in the past, I did not own that house. Does that make it OK for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;someone else to move in without my permission?
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough, it should be your call to keep them out. All I have to say,
<br>
though, is that considering the way things are going in Mexico and Central
<br>
America, you better be prepared to build a really expensive and complex
<br>
border barrier system. I can imagine this might hurt your commerce, though.
<br>
It will probably require you to get quite violent about enforcing things,
<br>
and I would imagine that is going to have all kinds of consequences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you are going to have immigrants, at least get educated ones. And then, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in that case, you have serious concerns about them competing with current 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;citizens for jobs.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I can imagine this is a tricky point. On one hand, importing talented
<br>
people will benefit your country, but I can imagine the locals wouldn't
<br>
feel too happy at first. Do the current immigration policies encourage or
<br>
discourage talented immigrants from going to the US?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We own this country, we get to voice our own opinions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freely, and we get to make the rules. The kinds of countries where common 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;men do not get to make the rules and voice opinions....that is the kind of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;country from whence the peasants came.  Let them stay in their beds, etc...
</em><br>
<p>Again, this can easily become for said peasants a matter of cost-benefit:
<br>
getting into the US seems certainly lots cheaper, both on an individual and
<br>
group sense, than headbutting against the kleptocracy and risking all kind of
<br>
nasties (in the worst case) or a lot of wasted time and still being dirt
<br>
poor (in the usual case). Can you really blame them for doing so?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Another thing, most of the mexican immigrants are indians, and they are the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;uneducated peasants who get the grunt work that would be going to US 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;citizens otherwise.  I am part indian, so therefore by the current calculus 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of racial political correctness, I get to criticise them.
</em><br>
<p>Indians or mestizos? I would have thought mestizos were a bigger component.
<br>
Also, I wonder about the competition for jobs, can you elaborate? Wouldn't
<br>
US citizens be glad to leave the grunt work to the immigrants, and aim for
<br>
other jobs of a more pleasant nature? As for the political correctness issue,
<br>
it is a US feature that I'm still unable to understand at all, so you don't
<br>
need to worry about me thinking you can't criticise them on that account.
<br>
