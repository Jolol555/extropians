<p>The rational mind cannot prevail.  What it can do is form a 
<br>
partnership.  The understanding of what the true requirements of 
<br>
the mental structures within which it operates enables it to adjust 
<br>
the demands that it makes.
<br>
<p>I recommend a variation the the Korzybski pause.  His theory of why 
<br>
this was a good idea was hopelessly naive.  The practice, itself, 
<br>
has much to recommend it.  If one can form the practice of asking 
<br>
oneself, &quot;Which of my ends does this further, and how does it 
<br>
further them?&quot;  Then one has taken a large step.  Don't insist on 
<br>
an answer.  Just stop for a few seconds to contemplate the 
<br>
question.  This sets a mental process in motion.  Over time, and 
<br>
not that long a time ... months, rather than years ... significant 
<br>
changes occur.
<br>
<p>OTOH, there do tend to remain difficult problems.  One example that 
<br>
bothers me a lot is my weight.  But there doesn't seem to be any 
<br>
easy connection between how much I want to eat and what I should 
<br>
eat.  It's much easier to adjust the selection of things that I 
<br>
choose to eat.  But then there's a large social element, here, that 
<br>
also tends to get in the way.  (It's one thing to address this kind 
<br>
of problem within oneself, it's another matter entirely to try to 
<br>
synchronize this with someone else.  I consider this a currently 
<br>
unsolved problem.)
