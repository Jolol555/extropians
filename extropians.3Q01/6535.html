how's this for a counter meme
<br>
<p>An open society has its costs, Americans never expect to have freedom for
<br>
free,  however defending the Freedoms that make this Great Country the
<br>
beacon of liberty for all the world cannot be had by destroying those very
<br>
freedoms we cherish, and is a self inflicted wound to the American spirit.We
<br>
shall not be intimidated into destroying those freedoms hard won with blood
<br>
and sacrifice, that we solemnly vow to protect.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I consider that the most extropic way of handling these technologies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Me too. But since &quot;we now are essentially back to square one with the
</em><br>
clipper
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chip,&quot; the most extropic alternative available to us (and our allies)
</em><br>
_now_ is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to infiltrate that &quot;select controlling group&quot; that you mentioned,
</em><br>
because it
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is very unlikely that we'll be able to persuade politicians to give
</em><br>
clipper
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chips equivalent user control to that enjoyed by owners of automobiles.
</em><br>
So, if
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you and Max More were on that &quot;select controlling group&quot; (and a
</em><br>
controlling
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; group of some sort will almost certainly emerge to fill the vacuum of
</em><br>
power),
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; why then I'd feel we're moving in the correct direction. Of course, &quot;the
</em><br>
ideal
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; controller is nobody&quot; -- but you know that is not going to happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are falling into a deterministic trap here: since the idea is making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rounds again you believe it will become a bill, that bill is going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get passed and implemented. But remember that the clipper chip was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *crushed*. The fact that this idea was defeated once means that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually going to have a harder time today than it would if it was an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely new concept with a clear background. Sure, it will get a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help from the current mood, but it is not an irresistible power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Although my ambitious side does like the idea of me and Max being part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the controlling group - in this case I guess that would be NIST, NSA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or some high level court - &quot;infiltrating&quot; them is of course a total pipe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dream. You won't get a chance to control a technology if you lie about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your intentions to the surrounding administration. Remember, in our kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of society you actually have to give reasons for your actions when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do them as part of an administration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A far more realistic approach to stop this technology is to raise hell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it - explain to proponents why it won't work and why it will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nasty side effects, get the non-initiated to understand what is wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with it and why it should not be supported.  Convince other nations to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not accept the standard. Develop other technologies that makes even the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introduction of the technology irrelevant. If it is passed, then work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against the laws, even to the point of civil disobedience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Notice that this is messy, real world things that have to be done. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no way of achiving it by wishing for the technology to be in wise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hands (and mine definitely aren't; I think I could make a fairly nasty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictator a la Trevor Goodchild if I got the chance - don't let me!).
