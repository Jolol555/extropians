<p><em>&gt; Its easier to send an ICBM on its course 35 minutes around the world
</em><br>
<p>That assumes: 1) you have ICBM capabilities 2) you're willing to reveal
<br>
your position, thus giving the enemy time to bring soft targets
<br>
underground and having some of deliverly vehicles intercepted, and the
<br>
launching ground saturated with a counterstrike.
<br>
<p>The umbrella is useless if a superpower gets pissed at you (because even
<br>
if you get absurdly lucky and intercept 90%, the rest of it will still
<br>
oversaturate you), and it's doubly useless if anyone else is going to
<br>
launch an attack against you.  Because anyone else is probably not going
<br>
to use an ICBM, and is not going to go through the whole huff-huff-huff
<br>
gauntlet-flinging-chivalry overhead, but simply hits you where it hurts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; then it is having someone in place ( constantly) to set-off a suitcase
</em><br>
<p>You don't have them in place, even stealthily installed. Nukes age, people
<br>
talk. You just bring them into country by the usual means, synchronously,
<br>
so that interception risk and hence forewarning is minimal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; nuke-which invariably has Less Killing Potential, then a Mirved Nuke.
</em><br>
<p>Suitcase nukes are hi-tech. The people who have them, typically keep them.
<br>
I'd rather expect something DIY the size of a small truck, or a ship
<br>
container.
<br>
<p>And the MIRV paradigm is doubly applicable for a stealth attack. Here you
<br>
have the best placement potential, especially if you have skyscraper and
<br>
other things high above. Civilian aircraft is also very handy here (the
<br>
nuke can be placed at optimal height, and is almost naked but for the
<br>
flimsy aircraft, very different as compared to a skyscraper), possibly
<br>
manned with a suicide mission pilot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if the Mirv warheads are loaded with gene-spliced anthrax, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alone, might guarantee a greater killing capacity then a suitcase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuke, simply because one may strike at several separated locations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather then punishing New York City, or Washington, DC.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. You don't use a nuke, and you do a stealthy attack. If the
<br>
pathogen choice is right, it will days before you realize you're under
<br>
massive attack.
<br>
<p>You don't have to kill 98% of a megacity. It's absolutely sufficient to
<br>
get at few 10-100 k to generate a veritable Bedlam. Purpose served,
<br>
mission accomplished.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Typically, the suitcase nukes have a detonation yield, of some 1-5
</em><br>
<p>Forget suitcase nukes. Nobody is going to use them, at least not yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; killions, which is smaller then the Hiroshima strike of 20 kilotons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the Nagasaki stike of 12 kiloton yields. The &quot;Davy Crocket&quot; level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backback nukes, developed in 1956 were designed to detonate at 1/2
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kiloton-1kiloton level explosions. These were the &quot;landmine&quot; nukes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would be used to eliminate a Soviet on-slaught through the Fulda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gap in Germany.
</em><br>
<p>...in Germany, where cities are just a few kilotons apart...
