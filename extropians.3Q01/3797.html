<em>&gt;&gt; Racist:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this captures a lot of it. But it might not be antagonism - someone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who feels friendly contempt, or who feels pity for an &quot;inferior&quot; race, would 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, I concur.  The wordier version should read, &quot;One who is antagonistic,
<br>
or feels pity or contempt (or admiration or respect) for someone else based
<br>
entirely on that person's race alone.&quot;
<br>
<p>I'm deliberately keeping this at the personal level.  I will allow that
<br>
someone may have great respect for (or disdain for) an entire *group*
<br>
of people---as a statistical group---without necessarily being a racist.
<br>
It is merely necessary, in this latter case, that their prejudice does
<br>
*not* extend to the numerous exceptions of their general admiration
<br>
or contempt.
<br>
<p>For example, I have enormous respect for the intelligence and
<br>
intellectual capabilities of those who trace their entire ancestry
<br>
to the Hungarian Jews once living in the Carpathian mountains.  But
<br>
in order not to be a racist, I must admit that a particular person
<br>
of this group might turn out to be quite dumb, and to be capable of
<br>
entirely forgetting about his or her ancestry.
