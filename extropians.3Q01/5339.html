&quot;You claim tire installers are making 50K? how about some proof, and
<br>
by the way if it wasn't worth it the company wouldn't pay it....&quot;
<br>
<p>They dont, instead they close up shop and move south, where the same job can
<br>
be performed just as well in a cheaper environment.  Then, of course,
<br>
everyone complains that these greedy corporations are stealing jobs from the
<br>
US and giving them to mexico, of course these same people turn around and
<br>
buy cheap imported clothed, electronics goods, and cars.  Very few of them
<br>
are willing to pay the extra money for a product required to pay the average
<br>
american worker.  
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Like given that without government intervention companies can form
<br>
monopoly/monopsonies and completely distort the prices in a market.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Either a monopoly or a monopsony can control the price of either
<br>
goods or labor.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p>only to a limited extent, see my previous objections to monopolies and price
<br>
fixing.
<br>
<p>But those things never last.  Even when price fixing, say four companies get
<br>
together and agree to charge $5 for thier product, which cost $1 to
<br>
manufacture and distribute, they now share the market equally.  It will
<br>
always be in one of the companies best interest to undercutt the others.  If
<br>
those four companies each shared 25% of the market then it would be in one
<br>
of the companies best interest to now charge $4 for thier product since they
<br>
may take a far greater percentage of the market.  If the market is not
<br>
equally shared by all companies, then it is not in the companies that are
<br>
not recieving an equal share's best interest to continue with that
<br>
agreement.  Also, other companies who might not be making a competing
<br>
product would then decide to since they could undercutt all the price fixing
<br>
competitors and take the whole market.  In this way price fixing never
<br>
lasts, and it can never go past a certain point in price anway.  If all the
<br>
companies who sell milk decided to charge $4 a gallon, would you still drink
<br>
it?  $8?  $32?  There is always a limit that anyone will pay for a product,
<br>
even in a monopoly the price is kept in check.  
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>Again, people will only pay a certain price for certain items, and no more.
<br>
This is why ketchup does not cost $100 per bottle.  Nobody would pay it,
<br>
even if all the ketchup companies decided to price fix at that, people would
<br>
switch to a different condoment.  If that was price fixed as well, they
<br>
would switch to nothing.  In the end, no amount of artifical impositiong of
<br>
demand, which is a valid part of capitalism, will convince the average
<br>
consumer to work 40 man-hours to pay for a bottle of ketchup.
<br>
<p>&quot;Lets try a modern day example. Suppose Microsoft was the only
<br>
software company in the world. Do you think anyone would be getting
<br>
stock options and bonuses or relocation allowances, or would
<br>
programmers be working for minimum wage.&quot;
<br>
<p>Do you think those people would continue working for microsoft?  Or would
<br>
they quit and start thier own software company?  Do you think that other
<br>
companies wouldnt then decide to enter the software market given the
<br>
potential profit margins?  Pointing out why free markets wont work by
<br>
imagining a world where only one producer is allowed isnt valid, as no such
<br>
world would exist.
<br>
<p>Regards
