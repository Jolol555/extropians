<p>I think that in general it is a good idea to come up with dreadful
<br>
scenarios in order to make sure they don't happen. But one should think
<br>
a bit about to whom one spread them (not that I think Bin Laden et al
<br>
subscribe to this list - too high noise level :-). As Adam Ierymenko
<br>
said, &quot;I can think of lots of creative terrorist actions.  So can anyone
<br>
else with half a brain.  Thankfully, most terrorists aren't that bright.
<br>
Don't share your brain with terrorists&quot;. But share it with others.
<br>
<p>That said, I think the feds *might* be interested in visits anyway. I
<br>
saw some report that one of the new antiterrorist proposals included
<br>
&quot;giving advice to terrorists&quot; as terrorism. I wonder how far the
<br>
transitivity goes? If I tell you that tankes with ammonia are
<br>
transported across Lake Mälaren, and you suggest that if somebody blew
<br>
them up it would make an awful damage, and then somebody did it, would I
<br>
become a terrorist? And the newspaper telling me about the tanker?
