<p>Well, monkey business it clearly is (I think this goes in the Creative
<br>
Tautology bag), and it is funny, in the classic pathetic humor style.  Yes, it
<br>
will all sort itself out with time, and most of the folks that are getting
<br>
&quot;up&quot; about this have no clue about the truly promethean impact of the things
<br>
we see coming in the next 20 years.  Galileo knew the solar system would keep
<br>
turning even if he recanted, and that there was no way to stop people from
<br>
knowing about it, eventually.  There is no way to stop people from finding out
<br>
that cells are machines, and although complex, are just patterns of atoms that
<br>
have self propagation 'potential'.  However, for this to be generally
<br>
understood, we will have to wait a bit more.
