<em>&gt; If you are going to treat kids as property, as you seem to be doing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then it's an inherent component of property ownership to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for the upkeep of your property.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, those government lands and parks needs some serious landscaping,
<br>
their nothing but overgrown weed farms, most are even preserved in that
<br>
manor!!! Sell em off to someone that can take care of them. Talk about
<br>
wasted resources...
<br>
<p>Still though, who defines the &quot;proper&quot; state of a peice of land. Maybe I
<br>
just dont like cutting my grass.	
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you don't pay property taxes or use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxes, your property can be taken away, for example.
</em><br>
<p>Id hardly call taxes &quot;upkeep&quot;, more like &quot;tribute&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintain your property such that it becomes a nuisance to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; owners, it can be confiscated from you. If you insist on treating kids
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as property, then there is an indeniable responsibility component to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ownership of children. If you produce kids (but cannot pay for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upkeep to keep them fed, clothed, housed, educated, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socialized such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they do not become nuisances to other individuals in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community), such that other people (the taxpayers of a welfare system)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are paying for that upkeep, then they are no longer YOUR 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kids, they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the taxpayer's kids, and you are merely their custodian, a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be revoked at the whim of the proper owners of the kids 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in question.
</em><br>
<p>Totally agree here! I never said they had a right to KEEP them. I just said
<br>
you cant go around sterilizing people. Damn right they have a legal
<br>
responsibility to maintain their kids.
