<em>&gt; &gt; I can see two options for the US at the moment. Either go

</em><br>
<em>&gt; for dark times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; indeed, because it is a war waged for the sake of vengence, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; answered with equal measure of the self same hatred. It is a war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wrong.  It will be a war to end the threat of such terrorism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not for simply vengeance.  It does not even require any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular hatred.  Just a firm determination to wipeout the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>And the method? How would one nation propose to wipe out &quot;the threat of
<br>
terrorism&quot; by declaring war on another?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That may or may not be doable but I am pretty tired it is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about &quot;vengeance&quot; and that we would be fueled by the same sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of hate and all the rest of the shallow bs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It seems pretty obvious that any kind of conventional war could not touch
<br>
&quot;the threat of terrorism&quot;. A silly idea. If the war effort is fueled by
<br>
anything, it is certainly not rationality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Or, the US can go find the guilty parties now, and bring 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to justice, by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the book. Try them, before the eyes of the entire world. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Show that the moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; highground isn't just something used to control the weaker 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries, but in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fact is a standard to which everyone must hold themselves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accountable, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those few countries that need not. I can only imagine what such an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; impressive action would do to unite the peoples of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world in proceeding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into what could become humanity's first century of civilisation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no international justice sufficient to the task and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is doubtful that you could get the real powers behind these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events and all those capable of and desirious of similar and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse atrocities in a peaceable, non-military manner.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>That perpetrators may not be easy to bring to justice legally may be so. If
<br>
nothing else, it would be an excellent opportunity to bring to light the
<br>
problems with the existing system, so that it could be fixed in this current
<br>
cooperative climate.
<br>
<p>A couple of points to add, though:
<br>
- The true perpetrators are dead, for the most part.
<br>
- &quot;...and all those capable of and desirious of similar and worse
<br>
atrocities...&quot; . Hmm, good old though crime. Are you seriously suggesting
<br>
killing people just because they might in the future decide to be
<br>
terrorists? According to whose judgement?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But there is still bloodlust to satisfy, and a question of jingoism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; answerable only in the basest terms. There is nothing I can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say to modify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any of that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am tired of the accusation, as I've set.  Do a bit deeper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis and you will see that the threat of the next level or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two of escalated terrorism would destroy a lot of freedom  and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slow down everything a lot, perhaps catastrophically so.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a huge sword hanging over the heads of us all.  We do need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do something to deal with this threat.  That goes far beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply bloodlust.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - samantha
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Killing people and breaking stuff, until you can figure out something
<br>
intelligent to do, doesn't jump out as the best course of action to me. I
<br>
would expect more sensible suggestions from extropians.
