<p>Sure, but the problem is nontrivial. Symbolic algebra and especially
<br>
analysis is rather hairy when you get to the details. Doing a bit of
<br>
derivation, substitution and pattern matching is a typical computer
<br>
science course exercise, but when you want to get performance, the
<br>
ability to handle integration, differential equations and start linking
<br>
with with numerical analysis the detail-devil jumps out with his
<br>
pitcfork bifurkation. Just take a look at the papers at
<br>
<a href="http://dft.if.uerj.br/odetools.html">http://dft.if.uerj.br/odetools.html</a> and
<br>
<a href="http://www.SymbolicNet.org/areas/GB_and_CS/index.html">http://www.SymbolicNet.org/areas/GB_and_CS/index.html</a>, or the quick
<br>
explanation at <a href="http://www.SymbolicNet.org/areas/factorization/index.html">http://www.SymbolicNet.org/areas/factorization/index.html</a>
<br>
<p>BTW, there seems to be some downloadable software at
<br>
<a href="http://www.SymbolicNet.org/ftpsoftware/ftpsoftware.html">http://www.SymbolicNet.org/ftpsoftware/ftpsoftware.html</a>
<br>
<p>and a version of venerable MACSYMA is apparently going gnu:

<em>&gt; Consider this: They do use programmatic mathematical notations to

</em><br>
<em>&gt;My version has more of a programmatic than a maths structure.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
This is the true engine of progress in computer science (or any other
<br>
field): hey, he did something in a way I think I can do better! Lets
<br>
make a better program!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, if you actually look at what I now have in mind, it would
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;This consists of a subtle but important difference. Maybe he had

<br>
As a computer scientist, I would suggest looking beyond what computer
<br>
language to use and instead try to formulate the *problem* you are
<br>
trying to solve more clearly. Once the problem is defined, you can
<br>
select a language or (more likely) write your own.
