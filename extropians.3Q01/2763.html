<p><em>&gt; Damn!, you do impress me with your dedication to stay current!  I wonder

</em><br>
<p>Well, I like to stay current on the latest scientific breakthroughs with 
<br>
signifigant potential for impact. Until the advent of the transhumantech 
<br>
mailing list, this was *the* best place for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also wonder...  How many of you have significant others who get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irritated(or just plain angry!) about all the time spent reading and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replying to the extrolist?  Please fill me in here.
</em><br>
<p>My significant other was sufficiently curious about the things I told her 
<br>
I was reading here, that she joined the list. &lt;waves!&gt;
<br>
<p>Of course, she's something special...
