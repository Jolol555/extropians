<br>
TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Meet Hal. Like any 18-month-old toddler, he likes
<br>
bananas, toys and playing in the park. He especially enjoys bedtime stories.
<br>
<p>But while other children are flesh and blood, Hal is actually a chain of
<br>
algorithms -- a computer program that is being raised as a child and taught to
<br>
speak through experiential learning in the same way as human children.
<br>
<p>``He is a curious, very clever child, someone that always wants to know
<br>
more,'' said neuro-linguist Dr. Anat Treister-Goren who is Hal's ``mommy'' and
<br>
readily admits her attachment.
<br>
<p>``Some kids are more predictable than others. He would be the surprising
<br>
type,'' she said. Treister-Goren talks to Hal and reads him stories in much
<br>
the same way a mother teaches her young child to learn about colors, food and
<br>
animals.
<br>
<p>``I build his world on daily basis,'' explained Treister-Goren.
<br>
<p>She heads the training department at the Israeli-based Artificial Intelligence
<br>
(AI), where she inputs information and language ability through conversations
<br>
with Hal and works with computer experts who fine-tune his algorithms to
<br>
enhance performance.
<br>
<p>The privately owned company, which is run by Israeli high-tech entrepreneur
<br>
Jack Dunietz, aims over the next 10 years to develop Hal into an ``adult''
<br>
computer program that can do what no program has ever done before -- pass the
<br>
Turing test.
<br>
<p>The British mathematician Alan Turing is one of the founders of computer
<br>
science and the father of artificial intelligence. More than 50 years ago he
<br>
predicted the advent of ''thinking machines.''
<br>
<p>But in Turing's time, computers were slow and cumbersome devices, utterly
<br>
incapable of fulfilling his vision.
<br>
<p>Turing, who died in 1954, left behind the benchmark test for an intelligent
<br>
computer -- it must fool a person into thinking it is human. No computer
<br>
program has ever succeeded.
<br>
<p>If, or when one does, it will open a Pandora's box of ethical and
<br>
philosophical questions. After all, if a computer is perceived to be as
<br>
intelligent as a person, what is the difference between a smart computer and a
<br>
human being?
<br>
<p>HAL FOOLS LANGUAGE EXPERTS
<br>
<p>Today's chatbots -- a computer program that has a persona and a name and chats
<br>
with you -- are incapable of dealing with changes in context or abstract ideas
<br>
and succeed only at momentarily tricking people regurgitating pre-programmed
<br>
answers.
<br>
<p>But Hal has fooled child language experts into thinking he is a toddler with
<br>
an understanding of about 200 words and a 50-word vocabulary which he uses in
<br>
short, infantile sentences.
<br>
<p>``Ball now park mommy,'' Hal tells Treister-Goren, then asks her to pack
<br>
bananas for a trip to the park, adding that ''monkeys like bananas,'' a detail
<br>
he picked up from a story on animals in a safari park.
<br>
<p>When Hal was ``born,'' he was hardwired with nothing more than the letters of
<br>
the alphabet and a preference for rewards -- a positive outcome -- over
<br>
punishments -- a negative one.
<br>
<p>The pre-programmed preference for rewards makes Hal strive for a correct
<br>
response. Treister-Goren corrects Hal's mistakes in her typewritten
<br>
conversations with him, an action Hal is programmed to recognize as a
<br>
punishment and avoids repeating.
<br>
<p>Named after the smooth-spoken computer Hal 9000 from the science fiction cult
<br>
film ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' the scientists and language specialists at AI
<br>
see Hal as the first step toward the computer of the movie.
<br>
<p>``All of us strongly believe that machines are the next step in evolution,''
<br>
said Dunietz. ``The distinction between real flesh and blood, old-fashioned
<br>
and the new kind, will start to blur.''
<br>
<p>Dunietz's ambition is to develop a computer that functions as an assistant,
<br>
doing all sorts of time-consuming chores.
<br>
<p>Going to Japan for a holiday? The computer will book your ticket, choose your
<br>
seat on the plane, organize a hotel and arrange for a rental car to await you
<br>
at the airport.
<br>
<p>``We can have a personal assistant, a slave, a friend who doesn't really
<br>
suffer by being delegated these tasks,'' he said.
<br>
<p>You will not need a mouse or keyboard to operate the computer as it will
<br>
function when you converse with it.
<br>
<p>``It is going to be the next user interface, the last user interface,''
<br>
Dunietz said, explaining that it will replace the mouse, computer pointing
<br>
devices and the Microsoft Windows environment.
<br>
<p>``Machines will be extremely human-like in many respects and particularly the
<br>
most important respect which is the ability to communicate like humans,''
<br>
Dunietz said.
<br>
<p>THE STUFF OF SCIENCE FICTION
<br>
<p>For years intelligent computers have featured in Hollywood productions such as
<br>
``Star Trek'' and most recently in Steven Spielberg's ``A.I. Artificial
<br>
Intelligence,'' a film about a robot boy called David who dreams of being
<br>
human.
<br>
<p>But intelligent machines have remained the domain of science fiction books and
<br>
movies even though AI's chief scientist Jason Hutchens believes the computer
<br>
technology of today is powerful enough to produce artificially intelligent
<br>
computers.
<br>
<p>``It's just that we don't know the secret yet,'' said Hutchens, an Australian
<br>
who won the prestigious Loebner artificial intelligence prize in 1996.
<br>
<p>``Our goal is the holy grail of artificial intelligence, it's to get a
<br>
computer program that can use language,'' he said. The idea is to educate Hal
<br>
gradually, the way a child learns, through trial-and-error and rewards when he
<br>
performs well.
<br>
<p>Hutchens explains that most artificial intelligence projects involve
<br>
programming a set of language and grammatical rules and inputting thousands of
<br>
pieces of information that we take for granted such as a table has four legs,
<br>
or apples grow on trees.
<br>
<p>``Those systems just haven't exhibited the kind of creativity that Hal has
<br>
exhibited and they certainly don't learn from their experience,'' he said.
<br>
``If we were to compare them head-to-head in a language learning scenario, Hal
<br>
would come out on top.''
<br>
<p>What Hutchens's team of mathematicians, computer scientists and engineers are
<br>
doing is essentially reinventing the wheel. They have adopted Turing's concept
<br>
of creating a child computer and raising it to be an ``adult computer.''
<br>
<p>``Instead of trying to produce a program to simulate the adult mind, why not
<br>
try to produce one which simulates the child's? If this were subject to an
<br>
appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain,'' Turing
<br>
wrote.
<br>
<p>AI is doing this by combining Hutchens's team of scientists with
<br>
Treister-Goren's team of learning specialists and linguists in a high-tech
<br>
environment near Tel Aviv.
<br>
<p>WILL COMPUTERS TAKE OVER THE WORLD?
<br>
<p>Hutchens believes it will take about a decade to develop Hal's language and
<br>
communications skills from that of a toddler to an adult. In the meantime
<br>
Dunietz hopes to start producing primitive versions of Hal by as early as next
<br>
year.
<br>
<p>``We believe that human beings are complicated machines, computers are also
<br>
machines, and we should be able to do with computers what human beings can
<br>
do,'' Hutchens said.
<br>
<p>The firm's philosophy is simple. If it looks intelligent and it sounds
<br>
intelligence, then it must be intelligent.
<br>
<p>``If you perceive other people are intelligent without knowing how their
<br>
brains work and if you were to meet a robot that is indistinguishable in human
<br>
appearance and indistinguishable in behavior then you would think it was a
<br>
human being,'' Hutchens explains.
<br>
<p>Science fiction aficionados are aware of the potential downside to Hal, whose
<br>
namesake in Stanley Kubrick's ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' killed off most of its
<br>
crew during a space mission.
<br>
<p>``Every technology which is very significant, very powerful, has a lot of
<br>
potential to change things is equally dangerous as it is promising,'' said
<br>
Dunietz, who believes his Hal will be a non-menacing version of Kubrick's
<br>
computer and will be the first intelligent machine.
<br>
<p>``These new entities are going to be more human than human. They are going to
<br>
be pro-human to the extent that they will take themselves as such,'' he said.
<br>
``They will be human-like.''
