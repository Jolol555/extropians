I'd like to add to and expand the Chinese thread by posting a recent
<br>
article 
<br>
on that country's geopolitical position from the excellent Jane's
<br>
Online. 
<br>
Should be of interest to those that have followed the discussion:

<br>
<p>The China-Pakistan alliance
<br>
<p>Despite differing political, economic, ideological and social systems, 
<br>
Pakistan and China have developed enduring strategic ties since their 
<br>
relationship was first established 50 years ago.
<br>
<p>Besides political and diplomatic co-operation, the two countries are 
<br>
extensively involved in wide-ranging defence co-operation, particularly
<br>
in 
<br>
the controversial area of nuclear weapons and missile technology.
<br>
<p>The present period of shifting regional and global balances of power has
<br>
<p>provided the two countries with greater opportunities to strengthen
<br>
their 
<br>
alliance than ever before. Now intelligence reports indicate that secret
<br>
<p>talks on nuclear development are currently underway.
<br>
<p>It is against this background of growing convergence of their interests
<br>
that 
<br>
the recent visit to Islamabad of Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji must be
<br>
viewed. 
<br>
The following developments are worth noting:
<br>
<p>1. Sharing the Chinese vision of a multi-polar world, Pakistan's
<br>
military 
<br>
chief executive, General Pervez Musharraf, expressed his opposition to
<br>
the 
<br>
regional dominance of India and global influence of the USA and called 
<br>
instead for a greater Chinese role in international affairs. By
<br>
rejecting 
<br>
the US National Missile Defence (NMD) programme in the presence of the 
<br>
Chinese leader, he has made clear Islamabad's strategic support for
<br>
Beijing 
<br>
- which is also opposed to the US' plans.
<br>
<p>2. General Musharraf also unequivocally expressed the view that &quot;the 
<br>
Pakistani people hope and pray that Taiwan will reunify with the
<br>
mainland of 
<br>
the motherland before long&quot;.
<br>
<p>3. In return, commenting on Pakistan's internal affairs, Premier Zhu
<br>
Rongji 
<br>
praised Musharraf for promoting stability and economic development, thus
<br>
- 
<br>
albeit indirectly - endorsing his military regime.
<br>
<p>4. The visiting Chinese leader also offered Beijing's support for 
<br>
Islamabad's position on the Kashmir issue.
<br>
<p>5. In addition to signing many economic agreements (along with $250
<br>
million 
<br>
worth of credit), Beijing has also extended assistance in developing 
<br>
Pakistan's nuclear power infrastructure and other core industrial
<br>
sectors. 
<br>
Rongji further announced that Pakistani imports would be given priority
<br>
in 
<br>
order to remove the trade imbalance between the two countries.
<br>
<p>6. Even more importantly, the two countries signed agreements construct 
<br>
jointly the deep-sea Gwadar Port on the Makran Coast in Baluchistan.
