</em><br>
<p>Last times I was evaluated I was an EN?P. The &quot;?&quot; was because I was evenly matched
<br>
high-thinking, high-feeling.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the Enneagram, which I'd never heard of, I'm afraid, I find I am a type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5, backed up equally by types 3 and 8.
</em><br>
<p>Well, there are lots of different interpretations of the Enneagram. I found lots
<br>
of 3 and 8 in myself, but discovered my baseline after cross-referencing many sources.
<br>
The variability in these interpretations bugs me, so I'm not advocating the E-stuff
<br>
outright. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Astrologically, I am a Leo.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; My experience is that the Myers-Briggs thing gives very convincing results
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yep, same here; I'm always careful to employ the whole &quot;natal horological astrology&quot;
<br>
term, though, since there might very well be some subtle things going on in the solar 
<br>
system that can be expressed in astrological terms. But the sign I was born under?
<br>
Hrmph.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Judgment reserved on the Enneagram.
</em><br>
<p>I'm beginning to think, from my reading, that there are too many Enneagrams to
<br>
justify the use of the definite article. There might be a pony in there somewhere,
<br>
but there's a whole lot of horseshit. It's a bit like &quot;air, fire, earth and water&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you have theories about other frequent participants? If it comes to that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what would you have guessed about me if I hadn't just revealed all?
</em><br>
<p>Nope, not as list participants. &quot;The margin is too small to contain it.&quot;
<br>
People I've met f2f, I might be willing to take a read on.
<br>
<p>I haven't got enough of a baseline for you--but the EP-IJ differences would
<br>
seem to suggest some &quot;dynamic tension&quot; might be possible between us.
<br>
Have sparks flown on your side? :)
<br>
<p>BTW, &quot;fanboy libertarianism&quot;, as used by Tim Maroney, might have lost something
<br>
in translation. 
<br>
<p>FYI, a &quot;fanboy&quot; is a stereotype, VERY distinct from a fan, and even more
<br>
distinct from a faaaan.
<br>
<p>A &quot;fanboy&quot;, in its original meaning, is the fat fellow with the uncomfortable, 
<br>
fat, strident, hair-trigger, poorly-socialized, get-a-life, self-unaware, 
<br>
occasionally-borderline personality you see not infrequently 
<br>
at comics conventions. Media examples may be found in abundance.
<br>
<p>Many of these creatures espouse hard-line libertarianismish things. There is
<br>
crossover into gaming conventions, etc. But it's a strict subset--
<br>
Tim's comment does not refer to the body of SF fans in general, neither 
<br>
&quot;First Fandom&quot;, nor the later crops.
