<em>&gt; * Among the options that have occurred to me to resolve this problem,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   the most appealing is to hasten the demise of these religions through
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   making people no longer believe them, thus largely negating the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   religious powers' influence.
</em><br>
<p>Hear! Hear!
<br>
<p>That exactly expresses the sentiment intended by the term &quot;debunk.&quot;
<br>
If we debunk religiosity, then this murderous poison and hocus-pocus can no
<br>
longer manipulate the general public.
<br>
<p>Imagine a world where power mongers can no longer incite the public to war for
<br>
some religious meme.
<br>
<p>Imagine no John Lennon, I wonder if you can. Of course you can't!
<br>
<p>Imagine there's no countries
<br>
It isn't hard to do
<br>
Nothing to kill or die for
<br>
And no religion too
<br>
Imagine all the people
<br>
Living life in peace...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...which leads to the debate as to how to do such a thing.  Personally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my own thought chain offers a different solution: hasten debunking via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology, both by exploring how exactly this happens (a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of science can already offer much immunity from religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memes)
</em><br>
<p>That's why I posted the info about
<br>
Why God Won't Go Away: Brain Science and the Biology of Belief
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; and by getting the relevant advanced technolgies into many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peoples' hands (thus making it easier to obtain said good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding, through frequent interaction with demonstrations of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles - for instance, experiencing memories copied into one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain by purely physical processes, which would not be possible if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;soul&quot; which contained such was purely nonphysical).  A person can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; silenced by a number of means (bullet, court order, inflicted poverty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.); a widely spread meme is more difficult to displace (which works
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both for and against us).
</em><br>
<p>I suspect one of the reasons policy makers don't ban AI research, and/or
<br>
projects which could lead to it (wouldn't that make Bill Joy joyous!), is that
<br>
they don't believe it's possible. Try to tell a Congress critter about the
<br>
evolutionary phase transition that human-competitive AI will usher in, and
<br>
they'll label you a wacko.
<br>
<p>That may also explain why some corporations downplay use of the term
<br>
&quot;artificial intelligence&quot; -- they don't want to scare people or cause
<br>
controversy. So they refer to AI agents as &quot;autonomous systems,&quot; or &quot;evolvable
<br>
machines,&quot; etc.
<br>
<p>I'd think it better to try to outlive religiosity instead of debunking it (Let
<br>
the religionists waste _their_ time with that crap), except that anti-cloning
<br>
laws prove that they won't let us do that. It's a war all right -- and we
<br>
didn't start it.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
