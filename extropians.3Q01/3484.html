<em>&gt; Why is this stuff on the Extropians List?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Claremont Institute is not only a conservative organization, but it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically a religious conservative organization. 
</em><br>
<p>Why do you seem to always start off your denounciation of any post you
<br>
disagree with by claiming that the website that is hosting the
<br>
information is owned by some allegedly extreme right wing organization?
<br>
While I agree with many of your points, Harvey, this is not a proper
<br>
debating tactic, as you and others continually claim in response to some
<br>
of my posts....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see why this is posted to the Extropians List.  Even for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purported goal of fostering new thinking, it seems to be off-topic.  Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should we evaluate Lincoln and his &quot;controversial&quot; policies?  Why should we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expose liberals as espousing a false history while touting conservatism as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the true historical basis of civilization?  Why should we discuss natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights and the source of true morality?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why does there seem to be an attempt to remake Extropians into a religious,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racist, radical right-wing movement?  What does any of this stuff have to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Extropianism?
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me that outside of a couple people asking the list for their
<br>
opinions on outside information of this sort, the only people who are
<br>
'remaking' anything are those of a more liberal stripe who whip out the
<br>
tar brush so rapidly any time someone says something they don't agree
<br>
with.
<br>
<p>There is a significant degree of conversation here recently about
<br>
racism, trust, liberty, etc. where many people are genuinely interested
<br>
in getting down to brass tacks about things. Practicing ostracism
<br>
instead contributes nothing, and simply adds to the shrillness of the
<br>
debate.
<br>
<p>I am not interested in any way in making Extropy into a relgion, a
<br>
racist group, or a radical right wing movement, contrary to what some
<br>
here claim. I am staunchly a libertarian, and natural law is very much a
<br>
libertarian concept. I agree that claims by the right that natural law
<br>
comes from God is NOT libertarian, and not extropian either, but I did
<br>
not see anything of this sort in the post that Harvey responded to
<br>
either.
