<em>&gt; &gt; I also think you have an inflated idea of what a hate crime is.  Hate crimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; give tougher sentences on criminals who commit violent crimes.  They do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; arrest people for mere words or ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would disagree with this.  The hate crime law does not give tougher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentences based on the violence of the crime.  They give tougher sentences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on what the perp was thinking.
</em><br>
<p>I think you have misread what Harvey wrote, in saying that you disagree.
<br>
Nothing you have written is inconsistent with what Harvey said.
<br>
<p>He did not say that the tougher sentences are based on violence of crimes,
<br>
as you suggest.  He said that the idea of hate crime laws is to increase
<br>
sentences, not to arrest people for certain words.  (I have lost the
<br>
context of his remarks, but perhaps someone had suggested that hate
<br>
crime laws involved arresting people for saying hateful things.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The point being this:  He gets 20 years for murder.  Why should he get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another 10 because of what he was thinking?  The woman is just as dead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of his thought process.  Also, many people worry that this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criminalizing certain thoughts.  They say (and I agree) murder is illegal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We don't need to (or want to) delve into what the guy was thinking.
</em><br>
<p>Several factors go into determining what the appropriate punishment is
<br>
for a crime.  Intent is one of those, as in our distinctions between
<br>
the various classifications of homicide.  First degree murder requires
<br>
premeditation; second degree murder requires malice; beyond that you have
<br>
voluntary manslaughter, such as in the heat of passion, or involuntary
<br>
manslaughter, from a reckless act.  Below that is negligent homicide.
<br>
All of these are fundamentally based on what the killer was thinking.
<br>
<p>It may be that society believes it is &quot;more evil&quot; to do certain acts with
<br>
a specific intent, and hence more deserving of punishment.  Racism has
<br>
been the cause of terrible evil over the centuries, and society may want
<br>
to see it punished more.
<br>
<p>Or it may be a pragmatic matter, that there is a major social problem of
<br>
violence being perpetrated for specific reasons, and in order to deter
<br>
this class of violence, the punishment is increased when those specific
<br>
reasons apply.
<br>
<p>I agree that it can be problematic to determine intent.  The burden of
<br>
proof should certainly be on the prosecution.  However I don't think we
<br>
should rule it out as a factor in considering the punishment for a crime.
<br>
