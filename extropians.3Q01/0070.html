<em>&gt; One area I thought worked well was when school kids all vehemently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insisted that air pollution was getting worse, and then Stossel showed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charts that showed major pollutants getting better.  However some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his other charts did not work so well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In discussing global warming, he showed a chart with temperature increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the past 100 years.  But then he pulled back to show it over a larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; span of several hundred years, and present temperatures were no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highest, things had been much higher a few hundred years ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think this is correct.  The chart's temperature axis read -32,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -34, -36 degrees down the vertical axis.  What was this a chart of?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I got the impression this was some polar region.  I think if you look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worldwide average temperatures then the recent temperatures are unusually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high even over the past 1000 years.  This chart was up so briefly that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably most viewers were unaware of the oddity.
</em><br>
<p>Well, his point, if you were paying attention, was that most of the
<br>
warming was occuring at the poles, so his chart, likely, was presenting
<br>
temperature changes at the poles, which do, in fact average their annual
<br>
temperatures heavily into the minuses. Also, I was under the impression
<br>
that the chart covered the last 10,000 years, not last 1000 years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In another example, an activist complained about the use of recombinant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bovine growth hormone (RBGH).  She said that the U.S. was the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industrialized country to allow its use.  Later she simplified that to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the U.S. was the only country which allowed it.  Stossel challenged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her and put up a quickly-scrolling list of other countries that allowed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the use of RGBH.  There were 20 or more and it made her look bad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if you looked closely at the list, all were Third World countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Venezuela, Mexico, etc., all poor nations.  The United States was the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First World country that I saw.  So in fact the activist was basically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct in her initial statement, although the streamlined version of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the message was not right.  But I felt that Stossel was trying to snow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the viewers by putting up the list so fast that most people couldn't read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it carefully.  (I Tivo'd the show so was able to view it at my leisure.)
</em><br>
<p>Could you post the list of countries? I'd hardly consider Mexico and
<br>
Venezuela undeveloped countries. They are industrialized, and Venezuela
<br>
is actually a rather rich country, not poor at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had a lot of other complaints too, as when Stossel would subtly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; switch the question being discussed, starting from the question of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether global warming is occuring and whether man is causing it, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then saying no, many scientists don't agree that global warming will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be harmful.  Both statements are true: there is a consensus that warming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is occuring and that it is very likely due in part to human activities;
</em><br>
<p>No, there is not a consensus among scientists, just among those with the
<br>
same agenda.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and there is much less consensus about the net effects of the warming,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because some will be good and some will be bad.  Stossel emphasized the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second point and let it be assumed that the disagreement covered the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other issue as well.
</em><br>
<p>Sure. If it is actually occuring, and its not actually a bad thing (who
<br>
can complain about millions of square miles of tundra becoming
<br>
productive agricultural acrage? Who can complain about the fact that if
<br>
sea levels rise, this will actually INCREASE the amount of coastline,
<br>
and therefore more seashore fore everybody....)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All in all I don't know how well Stossel has helped his cause with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show.  One interesting point is that probably a lot more people watched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it due to all the publicity gained by pulling the interviews with school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children at the last minute (interviews with other kids were substituted).
</em><br>
<p>And I think he got points for doing that in a way that illustrated the
<br>
manipulativeness of the greens.
