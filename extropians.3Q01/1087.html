<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Gary Lindsey
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barbara Wilson
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PASADENA, CALIF. - Computer chips today are small and getting smaller.
<br>
They're the reason devices like personal computers and cell phones keep
<br>
shrinking. But the limits of current technology might be just over the
<br>
horizon, according to some experts.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're reaching the point where we can no longer extend the
<br>
microelectronics technologies we've developed,&quot; says Barbara Wilson, chief
<br>
technologist for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. &quot;The
<br>
current estimate is we have about 10 to 15 years, after which time unless we
<br>
figure out how to work in the nanotechnology region you're not going to get
<br>
a computer that's going to be any better than the one you had last year.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new system at JPL is pushing the limit on what's possible right down
<br>
to the molecular level. For example, a document containing thousands of
<br>
names can now be shrunk to fit on the point of a pin.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We Have To Make Everything Small'
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NASA has a particular interest in nanotechnology given the high costs
<br>
in putting conventional spacecraft into orbit or beyond.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If you think about the fact that it costs $1 million or so to put a
<br>
kilogram package on the surface of Mars you can recognize how precious every
<br>
gram is that we send out there,&quot; says Wilson. &quot;We have to make everything
<br>
small. We have to put a whole laboratory on a chip essentially.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilson says that nanotechnology could also become important in keeping
<br>
space travelers healthy -- for instance, during a three-year trip to Mars.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;On an extended space voyage, you can't abort and go to a hospital,&quot;
<br>
says Wilson. &quot;You're stuck out there, sort of like some of the examples
<br>
we've had in the Antarctic recently. When we look into the future what we
<br>
hope is to do is have microscopic diagnostics right inside your system
<br>
because these things can be small enough to be totally not interfering with
<br>
the rest of your biological system.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean to the rest of us? It's hoped that those
<br>
microscopic devices could detect and destroy harmful micro-organisms before
<br>
they cause illness. But until then, nanotechnology has a lot of growing up
<br>
to do.
