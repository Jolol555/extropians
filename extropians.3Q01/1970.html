Alex responded:
<br>
<p>Couldn't this kind of studies be funded commercially? I see several
<br>
possible sources of income. First, private health information services
<br>
would like to be first with useful decision heuristics, especially if they
<br>
can gain from people referring to these studies (a reliable information
<br>
service would likely have to give literature citations to remain accredited
<br>
and convincing, so even when competing services refer to &quot;drug X is better
<br>
than Y&quot; they would have to include links to the originating/sponsoring
<br>
service).
<br>
<p>#### The cost of obtaining useful, reliable medical information is huge. How
<br>
much would a private medical information service have to charge to be able
<br>
to pay for all the studies it wants to inform people about? I would think
<br>
that that access to the information would be very expensive and at the same
<br>
time it would be too easy to freeload - unless you want to impose and
<br>
enforce gag rules on the users of the service (doctors, nurses), a study
<br>
result, worth 1 000 000 dollars (nothing unusual nowadays) could be
<br>
communicated in less than a minute of talking during morning rounds, even
<br>
spreading as gossip - and all the nonpaying residents, patients, would use
<br>
it to their advantage. So the persons who wanted to get newest results would
<br>
pay enormous sums, while anybody willing to wait a few days (literally),
<br>
would get it free.
<br>
<p>Those nice, informative LEF news bulletins would cost you 1000$ apiece if
<br>
not for the NIH.
<br>
<p>-------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Second, many drug companies would be interested in efficacy
<br>
trials (sure, they might risk having the worse drug, but not supporting a
<br>
trial could be even worse PR).
<br>
<p>##### I doubt it. Drug companies avoid head to head comparisons like the
<br>
plague, unless they are sure they win (and before actually doing the study,
<br>
usually you don't know). Also, they don't fund studies on drugs in the
<br>
public domain, like warfarin and aspirin, which are the mainstay of
<br>
treatment now.
<br>
<p>--------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Third, of course all the current non-profit
<br>
organisations would still likely be interested in funding some of these
<br>
studies: everything from the NIH to patient organisations.  The testing
<br>
could be handled by a third party testing organisation to minimize bias,
<br>
perhaps with standardized oversight and procedures.
<br>
<p>##### NIH is not a nonprofit. It's a government agency, one of the very few
<br>
that save lives but still a government, tax-funded unit.
