Falwell apologizes to gays, feminists, lesbians
<br>
September 14, 2001 Posted: 2:55 AM EDT (0655 GMT)
<br>
<p><p>LYNCHBURG, Virginia (CNN) -- The Rev. Jerry Falwell said late Thursday he
<br>
did not mean to blame feminists, gays or lesbians for bringing on the
<br>
terrorist attacks in New York and Washington this week, in remarks on a
<br>
television program earlier in the day.
<br>
<p>On the broadcast of the Christian television program &quot;The 700 Club,&quot; Falwell
<br>
made the following statement:
<br>
<p>&quot;I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists,
<br>
and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an
<br>
alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, all of them
<br>
who have tried to secularize America. I point the finger in their face and
<br>
say 'you helped this happen.'&quot;
<br>
<p>Falwell, pastor of the 22,000-member Thomas Road Baptist Church, viewed the
<br>
attacks as God's judgment on America for &quot;throwing God out of the public
<br>
square, out of the schools. The abortionists have got to bear some burden
<br>
for this because God will not be mocked.&quot;
<br>
<p>But in a phone call to CNN, Falwell said that only the hijackers and
<br>
terrorists were responsible for the deadly attacks.
<br>
<p>&quot;I do believe, as a theologian, based upon many Scriptures and particularly
<br>
Proverbs 14:23, which says 'living by God's principles promotes a nation to
<br>
greatness, violating those principles brings a nation to shame,'&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Falwell said he believes the ACLU and other organizations &quot;which have
<br>
attempted to secularize America, have removed our nation from its
<br>
relationship with Christ on which it was founded.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I therefore believe that that created an environment which possibly has
<br>
caused God to lift the veil of protection which has allowed no one to attack
<br>
America on our soil since 1812,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Pat Robertson, host of the 700 Club program, seemed to agree with Falwell's
<br>
earlier statements in a prayer during the program.
<br>
<p>&quot;We have sinned against Almighty God, at the highest level of our
<br>
government, we've stuck our finger in your eye,&quot; said Robertson. &quot;The
<br>
Supreme Court has insulted you over and over again, Lord. They've taken your
<br>
Bible away from the schools. They've forbidden little children to pray.
<br>
They've taken the knowledge of God as best they can, and organizations have
<br>
come into court to take the knowledge of God out of the public square of
<br>
America.&quot;
<br>
<p>National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Executive Director Lorri L. Jean
<br>
bristled at the idea that gays and lesbians had anything to do with the
<br>
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that may have left
<br>
thousands dead, and demanded an apology from Falwell.
<br>
<p>&quot;The terrible tragedy that has befallen our nation, and indeed the entire
<br>
global community, is the sad byproduct of fanaticism. It has its roots in
<br>
the same fanaticism that enables people like Jerry Falwell to preach hate
<br>
against those who do not think, live, or love in the exact same way he
<br>
does,&quot; she said.
<br>
<p>&quot;The tragedies that have occurred this week did not occur because someone
<br>
made God mad, as Mr. Falwell asserts. They occurred because of hate, pure
<br>
and simple. It is time to move beyond a place of hate and to a place of
<br>
healing. We hope that Mr. Falwell will apologize to the U.S. and world
<br>
communities.&quot;
<br>
<p>Falwell told CNN: &quot;I would never blame any human being except the
<br>
terrorists, and if I left that impression with gays or lesbians or anyone
<br>
else, I apologize.&quot;
