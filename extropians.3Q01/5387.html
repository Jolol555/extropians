<p><em>&gt; &gt; Spielberg says: &quot;I don't want to live the day when my laptop jumps off

the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;I want to say: Don't let it happen. It would be awful if one day a

</em><br>

<p>Syndicated Clarence Page also weighs in with the same point of view re the

Israeli &quot;AI&quot; child (discussed on this list a couple of weeks ago).  It seems

the prevailing point of view is the comparison of real &quot;flesh-and-blood&quot; vs.
<br>
cold artificial intelligence (however, note that when it comes to

superstition [e.g., &quot;God&quot;] v. real &quot;flesh-and-blood&quot; materialism,
<br>
superstition wins hands down):

<p>... how about trying virtual kids?
<br>
Thursday, August 30, 2001
<br>
<p>By CLARENCE PAGE
<br>
SYNDICATED COLUMNIST
<br>
<p>WASHINGTON -- Scientists in Israel are &quot;raising&quot; a computer program as if it
<br>
were a child, according to news reports. As a parent, I have a simple
<br>
question for those scientists: Are you sure you want to do this?
<br>
<p>The company called Artificial Intelligence reportedly loves its little
<br>
bundle of electronic joy. The company claims the program, nicknamed &quot;Hal,&quot;
<br>
has learned about as much language as an 18-month-old child. It reportedly
<br>
has learned to like toys, bananas, &quot;playing in the park&quot; and bedtime
<br>
stories.
<br>
<p>&quot;He is a curious, very clever child, someone that always wants to know
<br>
more,&quot; said neurolinguist Dr. Anat Treister-Goren who is Hal's &quot;mommy&quot; and
<br>
readily admits her attachment, according to Reuters.
<br>
<p>I am sure the scientific possibilities here are tremendous. Maybe someday
<br>
future humans will be able to download their own virtual baby, the way some
<br>
people download music today.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, aren't computers frustrating enough without programming one to
<br>
behave like a child?
<br>
<p>Sure, computer rearing is easy now. The program is young, cute, vulnerable
<br>
and innocent. No diapers to change. No post-midnight feedings. No spit-up on
<br>
the shoulders of your nice new suit. No colic.
<br>
<p>But just wait until it hits its &quot;terrible two's,&quot; the age when a child, once
<br>
it has learned how to talk, quickly learns how to talk back.
<br>
<p>Ah, such an amazing rosy joy lights up in a child's eyes once it discovers
<br>
the empowering little word, &quot;No.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Would you like some more mashed potatoes?&quot; I asked my son at the dinner
<br>
table one evening during this treacherous stage of life.
<br>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; he barked indignantly from his elevated perch atop a telephone book.
<br>
<p>&quot;Would you like some more applesauce?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;No!&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Would you like some ice cream?
<br>
<p>&quot;No. ...&quot; He stopped for a moment, realizing he had been had. Then,
<br>
responded, &quot;Yes!&quot;
<br>
<p>Gotcha!
<br>
<p>Thus begins years of increasingly sophisticated levels of argumentation and
<br>
debate. A battle of wits immediately ensues between parent and child that
<br>
does not end until, oh, maybe never.
<br>
<p>Wait, for example, until time comes for that little computer to go to
<br>
pre-school and all it wants to do is rest on its pudgy little algorithms and
<br>
watch the Cartoon Network.
<br>
<p>&quot;You need to get an education.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;This is educational.&quot;
<br>
<p>Before you know it, if its plug is not pulled, the computer is entering its
<br>
teen years, a time of ennui, mercurial moodiness, identity crises and the
<br>
firm conviction that one's parents are the dumbest creatures on the planet.
<br>
<p>At least, you probably won't have to worry about your computer asking for
<br>
the keys to the car.
<br>
<p>But what if it starts dialing up its computer friends behind your back?
<br>
<p>What if it makes a deal with your car's computer to run off to Silicon
<br>
Valley for the weekend?
<br>
<p>How are you going to punish your teen computer by ordering it &quot;grounded&quot;?
<br>
&quot;Grounding,&quot; in electronic lingo, is a good thing for sensitive computer
<br>
circuits.
<br>
<p>And, if your cyber-tyke gets through that rough teen patch, what about
<br>
college? Somehow the thought of a &quot;My Kid Is an Honor Computer at MIT's
<br>
Artificial Intelligence Lab&quot; bumper sticker doesn't have much zing to it.
<br>
<p>Besides, as my parents might well have asked, does it know enough to come in
<br>
out of the rain?
<br>
<p>So far, computer scientists have programmed computers to solve math
<br>
calculations that would dazzle Albert Einstein. But they've taken only baby
<br>
steps in conquering the mundane, everyday form of intelligence that we
<br>
humans call &quot;common sense.&quot;
<br>
<p>For example, the Web site for Cycorp, an artificial-intelligence company
<br>
based in Austin, Texas, calls itself &quot;the leading supplier of formalized
<br>
common sense.&quot;
<br>
<p>Cyc (pronounced like &quot;psych&quot;) products, the site says, have &quot;an immense
<br>
multi-contextual knowledge base&quot; and a highly efficient &quot;inference engine&quot;
<br>
to capture &quot;a large portion of what we normally consider consensus knowledge
<br>
about the world.&quot;
<br>
<p>The result? &quot;Cyc knows that trees are usually outdoors, that once people die
<br>
they stop buying things, and that glasses of liquid should be carried
<br>
rightside-up.&quot;
<br>
<p>Way to go, Cyc. Have a cookie. And don't get your circuits wet.
<br>
<p>Frankly, I still prefer to raise kids the old-fashioned way. It's
<br>
frustrating, but it's also fun.
