<p><em>&gt; It was different between different nations, but many of the eugenics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proponents did lobby for various government initiatives that in many

</em><br>
<em>&gt; various european nations were one result, for example.
</em><br>
<p>This thinking is not as extinct as some might think.  A judge recently
<br>
demanded that a certain man who kept fathering children and then not
<br>
paying child support desist from his procreative activities.  Ultimately,
<br>
IMO, it's who pays the bills that should have the choices.  As for
<br>
compulsory sterilization (or hospitalization), I really do have mixed
<br>
feelings about the following:  a small community has on its hands 
<br>
someone who can't or won't support himself, and lies about on main
<br>
street annoying the productive citizens who pass by (who find that
<br>
they must feed him to keep him alive, and wear earmuffs to keep his
<br>
insane shouting from driving them nuts).  Now does this small community
<br>
have a right to (i.e., do the people reading this agree that it's okay) 
<br>
to seize this person, hospitalize him, and even sterilize him?  As a
<br>
member of a small, rather isolated community typical of many in the
<br>
history books, I would cautiously endorse such actions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I recall the right-wing William Shockley proposing that we pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; $1000 per I.Q. point below 100 to people to not have children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If I had a real nation, and I cared about whether it prospered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in a competitive world, I think that I'd go along with his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; proposal!
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Would you allow immigration?  Think about it.  And how do you make sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people with &lt; 100 IQ don't cheat on the tests to get lower scores? 
</em><br>
<p>Well, this is a huge *IF*, but *if* I had a real nation, and cared
<br>
about whether it itself prospered and thrived in a competitive 
<br>
world, then the only immigrants that I'd allow were those of the
<br>
same cultural background as my own people, and who would seemlessly
<br>
fit in, without fracturing the society into different groups.
<br>
<p>If so many people cheat that it's a problem, well, then over time we
<br>
obviously select against such people!  :-)   Yes, I know that this 
<br>
might take too long, and these arguments are moot in the light of
<br>
the transcendental technological advances almost bound to be made
<br>
by any people who reach the first stages of industrialization.  But
<br>
speaking purely theoretically, if our patriots were so intent on
<br>
getting ten or twenty thousand dollars once in their life that they'd
<br>
forego reproduction, then that's fine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seriously, the idea is of course rather pointless because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heritability of intelligence is not that strong and the generation time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of humans is long, so when you would get your genetic change outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factors such as intelligence amplification would likely be far larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than any genetic benefits. Not to mention the issues whether high IQ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really helps a nation better than free trade or an open society. 
</em><br>
<p>High IQ in most historical epochs would definitely help a society,
<br>
but yes, perhaps not so much as free trade and openness do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not to mention the ethical problems with a government using tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money to reward lack of intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>The funds could be raised voluntarily.  In the 20th century it's hard
<br>
for us to appreciate doing things without a strong government, but
<br>
every time that Benjamin Franklin or others in his city wanted any
<br>
community projects undertaken, thing done, they'd go around door to
<br>
door getting &quot;subscriptions&quot;.   In most cases, that's how things 
<br>
should be done.  Freedom has worked very well, every time it's been
<br>
tried, so far as I know.
