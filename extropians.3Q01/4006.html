<p>
On the politics of agriculture: IMO, government subsidy of agriculture is
<br>
THE main reason for the continued use of inefficient and wasteful
<br>
agricultural methods. In the near future, this gov't policy could lead to a
<br>
lower standard of living for most Americans and possibly even to serious
<br>
water and food shortages.
<br>
<p>I found the following NYT article interesting mainly because it implies that
<br>
people are going to make the wrong choices in the near future with respect
<br>
to water use and conservation. Because so few people are directly involved
<br>
in agriculture, ignorance seems to be the rule rather than the exception,
<br>
even among people who are generally knowledgeable and intelligent.
<br>
<p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/12/national/12WATE.html?todaysheadlines">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/12/national/12WATE.html?todaysheadlines</a> (text
<br>
of first page below)
<br>
<p>Note especially the following paragraphs:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Farms use a majority of American water. At a time when most farms are
<br>
subsidized by the government — failing to make money in a global market —
<br>
many water experts say it is inevitable that water to meet future needs will
<br>
have to come from agriculture. The same amount of water it takes to support
<br>
just 10 farm jobs can support 100,000 high-tech jobs, said Peter Gleick, a
<br>
water expert with the nonprofit Pacific Institute in Oakland, Calif. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Note three things: First, present methods of farming are not efficient and
<br>
not profitable. Current food prices don't represent the true cost of
<br>
producing food by conventional farming methods, because the ag industry is
<br>
subsidized by federal and state governments. Second, the author of this
<br>
article implies that we can simply do away with farming. I wonder if he's
<br>
only temporarily overlooked the source of food, or if he's one of those
<br>
people who think food comes in boxes and plastic wrap and has never looked
<br>
beyond that (or perhaps he's in favor of importing most of our food). Third
<br>
(by implication), conventional farming methods use LOTS of water.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Mr. Pickens plans to pump water from the Ogallala and pipe it to cities in
<br>
Texas. In Southern California, a private company, Cadiz, is negotiating with
<br>
the agency that provides water for 17 million people to store water from the
<br>
Colorado River in a Mojave Desert aquifer and then sell it back in dry
<br>
years. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The Ogallala Aquifer is &quot;fossil&quot; water, not a rechargeable aquifer. Some
<br>
parts of this huge underground water source have already dried up,
<br>
compelling many west Texas ranchers to shut down their operations. It's
<br>
presently being rapidly depleted through agricultural irrigation. This is an
<br>
instance of the extent to which people grasp at temporary solutions to
<br>
long-term problems rather than making a logical assessment of the assets
<br>
available and the best use to which they can be put.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Global warming, which has been blamed for increased evaporation rates of
<br>
surface water and low mountain snowpack that feeds major rivers like the
<br>
Colorado and the Columbia, is cited by many scientists as the biggest single
<br>
culprit in some of the emerging water shortages&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Global warming may well be responsible for some of the developing water
<br>
shortage, but I hate to see it pointed to as the biggest single culprit.
<br>
This makes it too easy for people to decide there's nothing anyone can do
<br>
about the situation.
<br>
<p>Food production methods will necessarily change in the coming years, but the
<br>
rate of change is being held back by government subsidies. In many cases,
<br>
farmers are required to use conventional farming methods in order to get the
<br>
subsidies.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Since food and water are prerequisites of all human activity, encouraging
<br>
the development and use of more efficient agricultural methods should be one
<br>
of the highest priorities for those who value human life. Ending ag
<br>
subsidies is a step in the right direction.

<br>
<p>Near Vast Bodies of Water, Land Lies Parched
<br>
<p>By TIMOTHY EGAN
<br>
<p>OUTH ELGIN, Ill. — People who live at the emerald edge of this Chicago
<br>
suburb have noticed that something seems out of whack this year. The water
<br>
that once sustained a little pocket of life — beavers, muskrats, frogs and
<br>
cattails — has disappeared, and the land around it looks puckered, despite a
<br>
wet spring.
<br>
<p>A dried-up wetland was odd enough in a township that gets as much rain as
<br>
Seattle every year, in a region where floods are a fact of life, and the
<br>
summer humidity can make it seem like being inside the mouth of a dog. But
<br>
it could foretell something bigger, even more out of character, according to
<br>
a study that has stunned people in the Chicago metropolitan area.
<br>
<p>Parts of six counties in a region that borders one of the world's largest
<br>
freshwater sources, Lake Michigan, could be in for serious water shortages
<br>
within 20 years, the report by a regional planning commission said. And
<br>
while the June report surprised people who live near a lake system that
<br>
contains one-fifth of the world's surface fresh water, it did not surprise a
<br>
handful of corporations that have been saying that water will be for this
<br>
century what oil was for the last.
<br>
<p>This year, with shortages appearing in places that have never doubted the
<br>
future of their supply, many parts of the country have discovered water may
<br>
indeed be a commodity more precious than oil.
<br>
<p>Cities are cutting deals to siphon water from far away, destinies are being
<br>
reshaped and species put in peril by new plans to dip straws into
<br>
underground rivers or withered rivers.
<br>
<p>A general warming trend, sprawl that covers the sponge of land that normally
<br>
replenishes the nation's vast underground reservoirs, and the growing
<br>
demands of agriculture and expanding cities are the reasons most often cited
<br>
for accelerated water shortages.
<br>
<p>The problem, which used to be limited to the arid West, has dominated
<br>
community concerns in some of the most unlikely places.
<br>
<p>Florida's reservoirs below and above ground are badly depleted and becoming
<br>
briny with saltwater seepage. The water shortage is so bad in parts of the
<br>
state, despite a recent tropical storm, that people have been hauled into
<br>
court and fined for violating strict water rationing standards.
<br>
<p>In Kentucky, more than half of the state's 120 counties ran short of water
<br>
or were on the verge of shortages this year before heavy rains brought
<br>
relief.
<br>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest, where water is the master architect of a lush
<br>
land, too little water has been promised to too many people, leaving farms
<br>
and wildlife to wither in places like the Methow Valley in Washington or
<br>
Klamath Falls, Ore. — precursors of coming water clashes, according to many
<br>
experts. And a report released Thursday found that even in the suburbs
<br>
around Seattle, on the wet side of the Cascade Mountains, demand for water
<br>
is outstripping supply, raising the prospect of shortages within 20 years.
<br>
<p>Some major American cities in the Southwest, including El Paso, San Antonio
<br>
and Albuquerque, could go dry in 10 to 20 years. But a number of towns in
<br>
New England and the well- watered half of the Midwest are also facing the
<br>
prospect of running out of water in a generation's time.
<br>
<p>Here in the Great Lakes region, a fourth year in a row of declining water
<br>
levels has caused millions of dollars in losses for shipping companies,
<br>
marinas and other businesses and prompted further restrictions on future
<br>
water withdrawals for expanding suburbs.
<br>
<p>&quot;A lot of people just can't believe that we may be running out of water,
<br>
living this close to the Great Lakes,&quot; said Sarah Nerenberg, a water
<br>
engineer with the Northeastern Illinois Planning Commission, which conducted
<br>
the study on shortages.
<br>
<p>The federal government, which controls water to 31 million people in the
<br>
West but has far less control elsewhere, has offered little guidance for
<br>
struggling regions. In the absence of single power broker, a veritable
<br>
free-for-all has emerged, with private companies and individual states and
<br>
cities cutting their own deals.
<br>
<p>In northeast Kansas, for example, the water shortage is so severe that state
<br>
officials are discussing plans to build a pipeline, costing as much as $200
<br>
million, to the Missouri River to keep the area from going dry. But most of
<br>
the water in the Missouri is already spoken for, other users say, setting up
<br>
the kind of conflict that is endemic to the West.
<br>
<p>Some of the other big rivers that have long sustained American communities,
<br>
from the Ipswich in Massachusetts to the Rio Grande in the Southwest, are
<br>
running thin. The Rio Grande, drawn down by farmers and fast-growing cities
<br>
in New Mexico and Texas, is down to a bare trickle where it snakes through
<br>
Big Bend National Park in Texas. It is so braided with chemicals and salt
<br>
that fish, birds and animals that use it are dying, park rangers say.
<br>
<p>The problem in Chicago's suburbs is typical of the predicament facing other
<br>
traditionally wet areas. Water looks abundant here in Kane County, for
<br>
example, which lies between the nation's biggest river, the Mississippi, and
<br>
one of its biggest lakes, Michigan. But appearances are deceptive.
<br>
<p>Most of the nation's fresh water — about 60 percent — is out of sight. It
<br>
comes from below ground, in rivers and pools known as aquifers. These
<br>
aquifers are being depleted at the same time that surface water in lakes and
<br>
rivers is stressed by growing demands and heat.
<br>
<p>Many of the nation's biggest aquifers, such as the 175,000-square-mile
<br>
Ogallala in the southern Plains, have long been depleted by farming. To the
<br>
east, the underground river that brings water to the nation's most bountiful
<br>
rice crop, in Arkansas, will be dry in less than 15 years, hydrologists say.
<br>
<p>Global warming, which has been blamed for increased evaporation rates of
<br>
surface water and low mountain snowpack that feeds major rivers like the
<br>
Colorado and the Columbia, is cited by many scientists as the biggest single
<br>
culprit in some of the emerging water shortages.
<br>
<p>Last December, federal researchers said a gradually warming climate could
<br>
reduce levels in the Great Lakes by five feet at the end of the century, but
<br>
they also noted that the lake levels fluctuate, regardless of climate
<br>
changes. And a strict agreement signed by the governors of all the states
<br>
surrounding the Great Lakes and two Canadian provinces has made it unlikely
<br>
any new communities can tap into the big basin of fresh water.
