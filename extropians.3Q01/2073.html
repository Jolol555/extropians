<br>
both forces, it's just that the damage caused by the complete misuse of the 
<br>
free markets idea by the local establishment overshadows anything else for 
<br>
now. I don't see my country going anywhere until the establishment actually 
<br>
lets markets act instead of just pretending they do.
<br>
<p>Carlos,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps there is even less difference between us than we believe.  I 
<br>
see our poor class also being hurt badly and don't expect any improvement our 
<br>
until so called ruling class accepts truly free markets instead of the psuedo 
<br>
free market being peddled not.  I am skeptical.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent twenty years as a management consultant.  I estimate the 
<br>
average productivity in our manufacturing plants at no better than about 50%. 
<br>
&nbsp;Worse, I see us switching to foreign labor, automation, and foreign plants 
<br>
-- the first two are being operated at about the same level of productivity 
<br>
as we had before.  I have not seen the foreign plants operate but based on 
<br>
the manufacturing expertise of the few I have seen sent over there I expect 
<br>
them to be even worse than our domestic plants.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you a couple of fast examples.  Just before retiring I did 
<br>
an assignment for a plant owner.  He had one shear press that set the 
<br>
operating speed for his entire plant.  After checking I found the press was 
<br>
actually producing 17% of the time.  Sorry my memory boggled -- that was two 
<br>
presses each at 17% of the time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took several months to raise actual output of a welding department 
<br>
50%.  The owner thought I was wonderful.  I asked that my assignment be 
<br>
extended one day as I wanted to see what percentage of the time the welders 
<br>
had a welding gun in their hands.  I found I have gotten the welders up to 
<br>
34% utilization.  Yes, I shared that with my client.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also seen expensive automation purchased and operators allowed 
<br>
to restrict operation to roughly four or five hours per day.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I expecting things to get better?  No, I retired, that indicates my 
<br>
expectations.
<br>
