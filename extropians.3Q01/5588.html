<p>But you haven't done that...  amd you can't do that by
<br>
merely stringing together a few syllables.  
<br>
<p>Anomalous data is what demonstrates the existing
<br>
answers are incomplete (to show they are actually
<br>
wrong you'd still have to come up with something
<br>
better).  Where's the data?  I need data, not hot air
<br>
and hand waving.
<br>
<p>It is exactly this kind of thing that has made me lose
<br>
interest in philosophy.
<br>
<p>I simply don't care how many angels can dance on the
<br>
head of a pin.
<br>
<p>At least when science asks us to believe something
<br>
that is counter intuitive, it provides not only an
<br>
explanation, but also experimental data.
<br>
<p>As soon as you demonstrate to me that people with
<br>
different beliefs get different outcomes for the same
<br>
experiment, I'll give your theories a bit more
<br>
attention.
<br>
<p>Until then they are the equivalent of the gigantic
<br>
invisible purple alien who sits atop the world trade
<br>
center and controls the thoughts of everybody in New
<br>
York.
