&nbsp;
<br>
Most times it has been mentioned here, it has been either Oceania-style
<br>
floating structures on international waters, or buying some discreet little
<br>
island somewhere. Most proposals are just of the kind &quot;oh, it would be
<br>
neat&quot; with very little practical details. I think you will find more
<br>
carefully thought out ideas in libertarian circles, including settling as a
<br>
tribe in Somalia and using the lax regulations of a certain Costa Rican (?)
<br>
province. At least the Somalia attempt is being implemented right now.  Oh,
<br>
Sealand is another example, of course. It is operational, but not exactly
<br>
the most likely emigration target.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This is a kind of safety valve - suddenly the debate got too close to

</em><br>

<br>
<em>&gt; I think this concept has very high importantance if we want to succeed.

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, we may find it easier to move mountains than to move somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;narrow-minded and perhaps not too intelligent people from one side of an
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;tactics to &quot;brainwash&quot; them).
</em><br>
<p>Why do you think that everybody who is not of your opinion is narrow-minded
<br>
or unintelligent? OK, that was not what you meant, you probably just meant
<br>
the real luddites of whatever ideological color, but to succeed culturally
<br>
you don't have to convert them. Instead take a look at the normal people
<br>
around you, with opinions all over the place but by definition average
<br>
intelligence and education. Do you think it is extremely hard, nearly
<br>
impossible to convince them about what you believe? If you do, then you
<br>
don't have much confidence in your own ideas. These people are an enormous
<br>
power, and if they can be shown that what you propose is ethical and
<br>
practical, then you will have great support. 
<br>
<p>Moving physical mountains is just engineering and is indeed easily
<br>
solvable, especially given sufficient money. But setting up safe havens is
<br>
not just engineering, it is also a question about politics, law, economics
<br>
and in the end culture - just the things you think are exceedingly hard to
<br>
deal with. If you think bioconservatives are troublesome and narrow-minded,
<br>
just look at the politicians and international institutions you would have
<br>
to deal with if you tried to set up your own independent nation. 
<br>
<p>If you really think the powers of darkness are after you to the extent that
<br>
it makes eminent sense to flee to a suitably built-up guoyt in the Pacific,
<br>
why do you think they would not come after you? Remember that calls for
<br>
bans on cloning are not just calls for local bans, but global ones. And the
<br>
same would go for technologies with even greater ethical or physical
<br>
&quot;explosive&quot; potential. At this point one can start arguing about the
<br>
amounts of armaments necessary for a stand off against the rest of the
<br>
world, or some more clever political solution. And again you get dragged
<br>
into the swamp of politics, debate and making sure many others think that
<br>
your island is something great and worth supporting politically and
<br>
economically. So what you have really achieved is going a few thousand
<br>
kilometers and built a lot of (hopefully cool, at least) stuff in order to
<br>
acheive exactly the same thing you would need to do if you stayed in
<br>
whatever nation you live in and worked on making at least part of that
<br>
place progress-friendly. 
<br>
<p><p>A side note: this tendency to assume that everybody who doesn't agree with
<br>
us is either misinformed, stupid or narrowmindedly zealous is another thing
<br>
to look out for. We do it all the time. The greens do it all the time.
<br>
Clearly it is not entirely true, and the people who see through it and
<br>
manage to speak to the people who can indeed be made to change their minds
<br>
or at least see your point of view are going to be the memetic winners.
