I had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I am speculating; and I thank you for your interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; observations.  But historically there has been a pattern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of political extremism in Europe that American has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thankfully spared.  I don't think that you can deny that.
</em><br>
<p>to which Michael Butler replied
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think I can understand it. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consequently, I can neither confirm or deny it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you mean that the US hasn't had land wars across its face
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every few decades, you're right. Beyond that, I am baffled.
</em><br>
<p>Please see Mike Lorrey's post for examples.  The political
<br>
extremism of which we speak, e.g. that in Russia, Italy, 
<br>
Germany, and recently in Yugoslavia really doesn't seem to
<br>
have a counterpart in the Americas.  The explanation may be
<br>
so simple as the fact that democracy has been prevelent in
<br>
the U.S. for three hundred years.
<br>
<p>But I really appreciated Tiberius Gracchus's suggestion
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Many of the people who  migrated to North America from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europe hundreds of years ago were more susceptible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious fervor, and that susceptibility was passed down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culturally and/or genetically...
</em><br>
<p>and Mitch's:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...Perhaps religiosity, or sexual behavior, or drugs?  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Americans] are weird regarding that, in part, because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Anglo-Saxon predominant culture emphasized worries about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sex and sobriety, and they were primarily the founders of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm. The other major nation exhibiting Victorian sensibilities
<br>
was also free of aberrant political behavior.  Of course, it
<br>
would have to be &quot;from the people&quot;; efforts of the Soviet Union
<br>
to instill prudence, surface conformity, and abstinence in its
<br>
people never had a chance.
