<em>&gt; Good.  Then we totally agree.  All that remains is for you to explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically what was in the article that you question---rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just the web site it came from or who the author is affiliated with.
</em><br>
<p>Please accept my sincerest apologies that I simply do not have time to
<br>
research every point in this article or any of your other repeated articles.
<br>
I'm not even sure what specific points I could focus upon first to try to
<br>
speed this debate up.  In fact, I'm not even clear on what points you are
<br>
trying to make with these articles.
<br>
<p>Are you trying to prove that blacks are inferior to whites, blacks have
<br>
lower IQs than whites, and blacks commit more crimes than whites?  Are you
<br>
trying to prove that God has not been disproved, that this was always a
<br>
Christian nation, that our laws are all based on the Bible, and that a
<br>
specific religion is the best path to Truth?  Are you trying to prove that
<br>
conservatives have a longer history than liberals, or a more valid history
<br>
than liberals, or more of a claim to American history than liberals?  Are
<br>
you trying to prove that science is not the only or best way to truth, and
<br>
that nonscientific ways should be considered with equal authority as
<br>
science?  Or were all of these side-issues unrelated to some other point
<br>
that you were trying to make that got lost in the clutter?
<br>
<p>If you could present your viewpoints in a more direct manner, I am sure you
<br>
would find yourself receiving more direct responses.  Try stating specific
<br>
theories you propose or specific questions you would ask, without going
<br>
through all of these supporting documents first.  Otherwise, I can't afford
<br>
the time to do all this research just in case you might have an idea that I
<br>
would be interest in supporting or refuting.
