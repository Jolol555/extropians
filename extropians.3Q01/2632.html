<em>&gt;I sympathize with your country's plight. I would be interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your views as to how it could be resolved.
</em><br>
<p>As I probably mentioned in previous e-mails about this matter, I think
<br>
there is not much anyone can do for the time being. The chance that
<br>
privatizations and opening of markets could have provided seems wasted
<br>
in the corruption and incompetence of the local establishment. I really
<br>
have no idea. I guess we would need huge foreign investments in really
<br>
dynamic areas (not more basic services or agroindustries, which are in
<br>
any case in the hands of oligopolies). Can't see how to convince that
<br>
kind of capital to move in, with the political and social mess. The
<br>
infrastructure is quite apalling, though, particularly for high-tech
<br>
endeavours. Education levels are dropping horridly too, due to the
<br>
puny funding the state can afford on the area. I'm worried that
<br>
young people will be in general quite unable to face complex jobs.
<br>
So in brief, hell if I know... We seem to be stuck between stagnation
<br>
and disaster, and for a long long time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would like to recommend an excellent book I am reading &quot;The Lexus
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and The Olive Tree&quot; by Thomas Friedman as a place to perhaps gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a new perspective.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I had already jotted it down for a reading, hopefully soon. Thanks...
<br>
<p>-Carlos
