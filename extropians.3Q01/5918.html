This all seems rather odd. The article being criticised seems to have been
<br>
published 11 years ago under Max's original name, if I understand the stuff
<br>
at the bottom correctly (or was it published even earlier, with Lloyd's
<br>
supposed rebuttal appearing in 1990?). Things have moved on a long way since
<br>
then. I wouldn't have expected anyone to discuss an issue such as the nature
<br>
of the state in terms of memes back in 1990, even though the meme meme &lt;g&gt;
<br>
was obviously around.
<br>
<p>Actually, I'm not sure that it's a useful way of looking at the problem even
<br>
now. The word &quot;meme&quot; has its uses, as with Reason's Longevity Meme site. But
<br>
I'm sceptical about &quot;memetics&quot; as an explanatory system. What does Lloyd's
<br>
reference to memes add to O'Connor's reference to behaviour and thinking in
<br>
the para quoted?

<em>&gt;Max T. O' Connor in his article Deep Anarchy referenced
</em><br>
<em>&gt;below tries to make the case that the State does not exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;His bottom line seems to be:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'&quot;The State&quot; is really nothing more than statist behavior and belief - and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elements of this can be found in almost everyone. I have argued that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is no boundary which can divide off some behavior as constituting &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;State&quot; from other behavior. This point can be made more forceful by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;considering the wide range of statist behavior and thinking found in
</em><br>
society
<br>
<em>&gt;(or &quot;society&quot;!). If it were possible to order these instances along a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spectrum we might arbitrarily draw a line beyond which we would say the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;collection of behaviors was &quot;the State.&quot; However, apart from the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it would be arbitrary (unlike the division of eagle parts from non-eagle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parts), there is no single dimension to be ordered into a spectrum. People
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can be more or less statist at different times and in very different and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incomparable ways.'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lloyd Again:  However, this ignores the theory of memes.  Memes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are ideas that spread from one mind to another as a contagion.  These
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideas form systems...we could say, a &quot;memetic field&quot;.  Individuals in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statist memetic field consitute of State to the extent they are in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resonance with the State's memetic field.  It is a matter of degee.  QED
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;More from Lloyd:  Strange that an extropian would forget the theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of memes.  Memes are to Social Organisms (A State is a special type
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of social organism along with ethnic groups, races, religions, etc.) as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Genes are to Biological Organisms.
