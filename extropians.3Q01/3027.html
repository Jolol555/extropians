</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolutely true.
</em><br>
<p>Remember Ronald Bailey's article about how the anti-technology movement
<br>
is starting to think about how to stop nanotechnology? On the other
<br>
hand, Eric Drexler told an amusing anecdote at Extro 3 about how he had
<br>
run into one of the founders of EarthFirst! and got him *optimistic*
<br>
about nanotechnology as an environmental solution (let's hope there is
<br>
no causal relationship between these two events). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, it's not just cloning. We've already entered the &quot;singularity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shadow&quot;, folks, the time when the prospect of transhuman technologies - the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shadow of the looming Spike ahead - causes intellectual ferment and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political opposition. We've got to play our part in this ferment. At the 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't think of much to do at the moment except, from a personal viewpoint, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become as embroiled in the issues as I can in the public debate, using 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources such as this list to help me, and to encourage others to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likewise (and offer my help!). Oh, and try to be/sound *very* reasonable. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some of the anti-tech arguments will not simply be theocratic bullshit and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will make sense. We need to deal with this patiently.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. This cannot be repeated often enough. We need good arguments
<br>
and presentations, and right now we seriously run the risk that our
<br>
collective efforts are ruined by individual pro-transhumanist but media
<br>
illiterate people, or even worse pro-transhumanists with bad arguments. 
<br>
<p>One thing that might be helpful is having organisations enabling
<br>
concerted campaigns, lecturing services and media training. Another
<br>
thing that we also need is a deeper ideological debate, making us better
<br>
at arguing from our first principles and far more consistent. 
<br>
<p>One problem I have noted on this (and other transhumanist) lists is that
<br>
whenever serious issues in current society comes up, someone pipes in a
<br>
suggestion like &quot;lets all move to a remote island and set up a
<br>
libertarian state&quot; (or utopian socialist state or something similar).
<br>
This is a kind of safety valve - suddenly the debate got too close to
<br>
home and reality for comfort, so one can save onself by indulging in a
<br>
fantasy. Which unfortunately tends to distract the real debate by
<br>
getting into all the devilish details of sea construction, libertarian
<br>
constitutions and which island has the nicest climate. Another version
<br>
of this reaction is to get trapped into conspiracy theories about how
<br>
the Powers That Be try to suppress us (unfortunately we do it much
<br>
better ourselves ;-) instead of getting into a real political or
<br>
cultural analysis. We need to get over this kind of distraction.
<br>
<p>Well, if all else fails, read up on <a href="http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/InfoWar/">http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/InfoWar/</a>
<br>
and start implementing the Concordat. But if we would have to do that,
<br>
then we have already failed memetically. I think we can do far better
<br>
in the real world.
