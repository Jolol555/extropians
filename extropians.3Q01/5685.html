<em>&gt; Most of the countries that score higher than US kids on tests do so

</em><br>
<em>&gt; kids out around the 6th or 7th grade, sending the achievers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; university prep high schools, and those that don't to vocational high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schools. The kids that take these comparison tests are only from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; university prep high schools, not the vocational ones, which is why they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; score so high.
</em><br>
<p><p>While they don't exactly advertise it, most of the top public school
<br>
districts in the U.S. do this too, with the predictable results that they
<br>
look very, very good academically.  People who either cause trouble or
<br>
aren't making the grade are diverted to a second-tier school (nobody goes
<br>
there unless they are sent there by the school district) that attempts to
<br>
turn them into productive members of society rather than academic
<br>
superstars.  Having spent a few years in one of these school districts (in
<br>
the good school :^), I can say that it really does make a noticeable
<br>
difference, both in the quality of the students AND in the quality of the
<br>
teachers.  Even though it was a public high school, we had numerous PhDs
<br>
teaching in their fields of expertise while living in a large metropolitan
<br>
area (San Diego).  The difference between the senior year in that high
<br>
school and the freshman year at the university was surprisingly narrow,
<br>
largely because the standards in high school were uncharacteristically high.
<br>
Most other schools I attended were not like this at all.
<br>
<p>Most school districts in the U.S. do *not* separate the sheep from the goats
<br>
as it were, but it is how most of the &quot;top&quot; public schools became &quot;top&quot;.  It
<br>
has more to do with parental involvement in the school district than
<br>
anything, as they are the ones that insist things be run this way.
