</em><br>
<p>Well, cooking up a transhumanist neoaristotelian system is not something
<br>
that can be done in an afternoon (Waldemar has spent some effort in
<br>
convincing me about this, finally succeeding by lending me Rasmussen and
<br>
van den Uyl - ouch! :-). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suppose we might need to begin a few steps back with the function of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leading an active life in accordance with reason, and what this might now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involve. Certainly, the particular virtues (and vices) that Aristotle
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; since Aristotle was not a thinker who was oriented to moral reform.
</em><br>
<p>One development that might be interesting to link with the aristotelian
<br>
idea of reason as the human end with the renaissance humanist view of
<br>
the human as a being not just endowed with freedom but also the freedom
<br>
to change and shape itself (as expressed beautifully by Mirandola). If
<br>
we extend the idea of the human as a rational animal to the idea of the
<br>
human as a rational self-changing animal we get a lot of transhumanism
<br>
into the system right at the start. This view of human nature as
<br>
basically processual (we are not so much human beings but human
<br>
becomings) seems to fit well with modern perspectives on how the body
<br>
develops, how the brain self-organises, learns and shapes itself through
<br>
interactions with the environment, evolutionary epistemology a la Popper
<br>
and the informational paradigm that seems to be growing in the sciences
<br>
today.  W can reach happiness not just by reason, but also by growing
<br>
(although strictly speaking these are just two sides of the same
<br>
concept, the general adaptability of the human mind).
<br>
<p>I think quite a few &quot;new&quot; virtues can be derived from this extended
<br>
concept of the human. A local :-) example would be the extropian
<br>
principles. While they are not per se virtues (rather good things to
<br>
strive towards), they encompass virtues. If we look at the comments in
<br>
the principles practical optimism is described as a mean against
<br>
pessimism and unfounded optimism. Self-transformation is it is expressed
<br>
a mean between personal stasis and unfounded dreams of greatness.
<br>
Perpetual progress is a mean between accepting unnecessary limits and
<br>
railing against unyielding limits. Intelligent technology is the virtue
<br>
of using technology properly. Self-direction balances independence with
<br>
being controlled by others. Rational thinking is a mean between
<br>
dogmatism  of any kind and paralysing scepticism. Open society is not a
<br>
virtue per se, but rather a striving for societies where virtues of this
<br>
kind can be developed, and hence implies a certain responsibility for
<br>
creating and maintaining one's society.
<br>
<p>Transhumanism does not just deal with actualizing human potential, but
<br>
also extending human potential (to its own fullest potential). There
<br>
might thus even exist meta-virtues dealing with the potential increase:
<br>
how much effort to spend on fulfilling my current potential and how much
<br>
on enlarging this potential?
