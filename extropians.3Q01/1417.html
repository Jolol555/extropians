Hi Reason,

<p>I am surprised. Do you really think that is the only reason power becomes 
<br>
concentrated?
<br>
<p>What about when a small company tries to enter a market, the big players 
<br>
reduce their prices to below cost so as to put the new entrant out of 
<br>
business? That is a tactic very often used.
<br>
<p>How about this one: the big player buys the small startup.
<br>
<p>There are plenty of other tactics too, that are not so above-board.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;All monopolies are unstable;
</em><br>
<p>In the long run, I agree with you. What I think worries most people is the 
<br>
incredible damage to the people and the economy that they can wreak along 
<br>
the way. Sure, they have to fall eventually, but they could last hundreds 
<br>
of years... do you think the next generation should have to deal with that 
<br>
legacy?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;Look at the much less regulated computer and software industry. It's in a
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I am amazed that you would choose Microsoft here; they are a great example 
<br>
of the kind of error that capitalism is prone to. They are corporate 
<br>
bullies that produce a substandard product, yet they have grown to 
<br>
incredible riches through shrewd marketing.
<br>
<p>Have you read the Halloween documents?

<br>
<p>The best thing that has come out of the computer industry is the 
<br>
open-source movement, which is a strange combination of socialism and 
<br>
capitalism, yet is neither. It seems to need a certain threshold of general 
<br>
wealth in which to grow, so it probably needs capitalism as its 
<br>
springboard. Some of its greatest strongholds are counties which most 
<br>
successfully combine socialism and capitalism. It has a very strong 
<br>
affinity with libertarianism, yet also with anarchist ideals and social 
<br>
responsibility. It values the individual more highly than any other system 
<br>
that I know of.
<br>
<p>I actually hope that somehow open-source will give us the model for moving 
<br>
forward into the future. I am not sure how yet, but it sure feels like it 
<br>
combines the best of all worlds.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;Someone earlier said that power ends up in the hands of those with control
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of resources sooner or later in whatever system you're in. Very true. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;big advantage of capitalism over other forms of economic government is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is doesn't attempt to get people to act in non-natural ways. Why fight the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tide?
</em><br>
<p>Because of the abuse by those natural accumulations of power.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;You want a form of government that works with the way in which groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of people will act, otherwise you end up with a big mess on top of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;normal way in which people act. Communism as was practiced in the USSR for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example...the underlying real social interaction was all about accumulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and exchange of resources.
</em><br>
<p>Very few countries actually practice communism. Certainly the USSR didn't. 
<br>
As far as I can see, communism is a system that only seems to work in very 
<br>
poor societies. Although I gotta say the kibbutzes(sp?) in Israel seem a 
<br>
pretty neat anomaly.
<br>
<p>The USSR most resembled an enlarged bureaucratic corporation.
<br>
<p>But, yes I agree with you.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;the more [societies] are under centralized control---the worse they are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, this is exactly my point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And the reason decentralized control is good is above: it's a very good way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(indeed, probably the only way with the computing power available now) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;flow with the desires and actions of the governed.
</em><br>
<p>I can't argue with that. That's what I want too. What worries me is that 
<br>
capitalism with its pricewars, mergers, and buyouts always ends up 
<br>
centralising power... just as all other systems do. It is a bit more 
<br>
promising, and delivers a heck of a lot along the way, sure, but I can see 
<br>
it ending up in the same place.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,

<br>
herself from this sticky thread :)

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
