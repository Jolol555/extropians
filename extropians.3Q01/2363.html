Olga Bourlin shared with us:
<br>
Having worked my way through college ... and working, for some years as a 
<br>
single parent, at a full-time job where I babysat another working woman's 
<br>
children at night (in exchange for having my children babysat), rousing my 
<br>
children from sleep to take them home at 2:15 a.m. in the morning (FYI, I 
<br>
don't believe in alimony or child support on principle) ... and at another 
<br>
time (children grown, but one still in college) having two full-time jobs 
<br>
for over three years ... I know something about working and being 
<br>
responsible. (This is not presented as argument, merely as background.)
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>Olga, since you made this statement onlist I will ask you publicly... WHY do 
<br>
you not believe in child support on principle???
<br>
<p>My own mother did not ask(or sue) my biological father thirty-three years 
<br>
ago when he decided to walk away from his responsibilities.  She felt it was 
<br>
all &quot;her responsibility&quot; and did not want to &quot;bother&quot; him.  My father should 
<br>
have been VERY bothered and done his share no matter what!  I am still very 
<br>
angry about this.  We knew poverty because of his cowardice and addiction to 
<br>
the uninterrupted &quot;good life.&quot;  And my father had a good job, and no other 
<br>
children to support.  Personally, I am very happy to see how things have 
<br>
changed since that time.
<br>
<p>As a man I do believe some men really get taken to the cleaners in divorce 
<br>
court.  And for a woman to get alimony for more then a few years(to upgrade 
<br>
her work skills) is generally rediculous.  But, child support is about the 
<br>
children and deadbeat dads make me want to grind my teeth in anger.  Olga, 
<br>
you and your children deserved better.
<br>
<p>sincerely,
<br>
<p>John
