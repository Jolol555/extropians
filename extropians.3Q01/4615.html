<p><em>&gt;Parents who parent do in fact pay for their own childrens'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education, and then soldier on to pay the taxes that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;provide for the twelve years' warehousing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indoctrination that the hinds' get gets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The notion that state schools benefit all segments of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society because they provide universal literacy, knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the historical basis of the culture, and understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the mechanisms of citizen participation may have had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some past relation with reality but these don't be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;days.
</em><br>
<p>I'm no fan of public education.  Particularly the LAUSD and I'd rather eat 
<br>
worms than send my kids to public school in L.A.  But there is a *large* 
<br>
segment of society that cannot afford to pay for the education of their 
<br>
kids.  If public school education were to be suddenly eliminated... well, 
<br>
that would be the equivolent of saying &quot;let them eat cake.&quot;  And in that 
<br>
event I would not send my kids to their private school unless they were 
<br>
accompanied by a contingent of armed guards.

<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
