<em>&gt; Usually undernourished people's immune systems shut down and they die of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pneumonia, tuberculosis, or some other infectious disease. Tuberculosis is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becoming quite a problem in Mexico lately and in certain poor areas of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S.A.
</em><br>
<p><p>Tuberculosis isn't just a problem in poor areas.  Just about *any* area with
<br>
a high population of recent immigrants, particularly illegal ones, has a
<br>
general problem with this disease.
<br>
<p>In the greater Silicon Valley area, the incidence of TB is higher than in
<br>
many third world countries.  People in wealthy neighborhoods who lead normal
<br>
cushy lives are testing positive for TB in this area.  In the last 6 months
<br>
I know of two very well-off (unrelated) individuals who tested positive for
<br>
TB despite testing negative a year prior.  Nothing in the lifestyle of these
<br>
people would suggest that they should contract TB.  The fact that TB testing
<br>
is becoming a routine health check in the Bay Area indicates the severity of
<br>
the problem.
<br>
<p>The problem is being caused almost entirely by the virtually unchecked
<br>
influx of illegal immigrants from Mexico, which is practically being
<br>
encouraged by the Federal government these days.  Regardless of what you
<br>
think of illegal immigration, it is in fact posing a huge health risk to the
<br>
people that live in the border regions.  The fact that TB and other diseases
<br>
directly linked to illegal immigration are approaching epidemic levels in
<br>
border regions supports the argument frequently leveled that the cost of
<br>
having open or loose borders with Mexico outweigh the costs to the people
<br>
that live on this side of the border.  In a sense, the U.S. and Mexican
<br>
governments have been colluding in a way that allows Mexico to impose huge
<br>
external costs on the people who live in border states to the benefit of the
<br>
Mexican government and a few political/economic interests in the U.S.  It is
<br>
no wonder that the people in these states are severely pissed about it.
