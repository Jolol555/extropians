<br>
<p><p>World War III
<br>
<p>By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/13/opinion/13FRIE.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/13/opinion/13FRIE.html</a>
<br>
<p><p>JERUSALEM -- As I restlessly lay awake early yesterday, with CNN on 
<br>
my TV and dawn breaking over the holy places of Jerusalem, my ear 
<br>
somehow latched onto a statement made by the U.S. transportation 
<br>
secretary, Norman Mineta, about the new precautions that would be put 
<br>
in place at U.S. airports in the wake of Tuesday's unspeakable 
<br>
terrorist attacks: There will be no more curbside check-in, he said. 
<br>
I suddenly imagined a group of terrorists somewhere here in the 
<br>
Middle East, sipping coffee, also watching CNN and laughing 
<br>
hysterically: &quot;Hey boss, did you hear that? We just blew up Wall 
<br>
Street and the Pentagon and their response is no more curbside 
<br>
check-in?&quot;
<br>
<p>I don't mean to criticize Mr. Mineta. He is doing what he can. And I 
<br>
have absolutely no doubt that the Bush team, when it identifies the 
<br>
perpetrators, will make them pay dearly. Yet there was something so 
<br>
absurdly futile and American about the curbside ban that I couldn't 
<br>
help but wonder: Does my country really understand that this is World 
<br>
War III? And if this attack was the Pearl Harbor of World War III, it 
<br>
means there is a long, long war ahead.
<br>
<p>And this Third World War does not pit us against another superpower. 
<br>
It pits us - the world's only superpower and quintessential symbol of 
<br>
liberal, free-market, Western values - against all the 
<br>
super-empowered angry men and women out there. Many of these 
<br>
super-empowered angry people hail from failing states in the Muslim 
<br>
and third world. They do not share our values, they resent America's 
<br>
influence over their lives, politics and children, not to mention our 
<br>
support for Israel, and they often blame America for the failure of 
<br>
their societies to master modernity.
<br>
<p>What makes them super-empowered, though, is their genius at using the 
<br>
networked world, the Internet and the very high technology they hate 
<br>
to attack us. Think about it: They turned our most advanced civilian 
<br>
planes into human-directed, precision-guided cruise missiles - a 
<br>
diabolical melding of their fanaticism and our technology. Jihad 
<br>
Online. And think of what they hit: The World Trade Center - the 
<br>
beacon of American-led capitalism that both tempts and repels them, 
<br>
and the Pentagon, the embodiment of American military superiority.
<br>
<p>And think about what places in Israel the Palestinian suicide bombers 
<br>
have targeted most. &quot;They never hit synagogues or settlements or 
<br>
Israeli religious zealots,&quot; said the Haaretz columnist Ari Shavit. 
<br>
&quot;They hit the Sbarro pizza parlor, the Netanya shopping mall. The 
<br>
Dolphinarium disco. They hit the yuppie Israel, not the yeshiva 
<br>
Israel.&quot;
<br>
<p>So what is required to fight a war against such people in such a 
<br>
world? To start with, we as Americans will never be able to penetrate 
<br>
such small groups, often based on family ties, who live in places 
<br>
such as Afghanistan, Pakistan or Lebanon's wild Bekaa Valley. The 
<br>
only people who can penetrate these shadowy and ever-mutating groups, 
<br>
and deter them, are their own societies. And even they can't do it 
<br>
consistently. So give the C.I.A. a break.
<br>
<p>Israeli officials will tell you that the only time they have had real 
<br>
quiet and real control over the suicide bombers and radical 
<br>
Palestinian groups, such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad, is when Yasir 
<br>
Arafat and his Palestinian Authority tracked them, jailed them or 
<br>
deterred them.
<br>
<p>So then the question becomes, What does it take for us to get the 
<br>
societies that host terrorist groups to truly act against them?
<br>
<p>First we have to prove that we are serious, and that we understand 
<br>
that many of these terrorists hate our existence, not just our 
<br>
policies. In June I wrote a column about the fact that a few 
<br>
cell-phone threats from Osama bin Laden had prompted President Bush 
<br>
to withdraw the F.B.I. from Yemen, a U.S. Marine contingent from 
<br>
Jordan and the U.S. Fifth Fleet from its home base in the Persian 
<br>
Gulf. This U.S. retreat was noticed all over the region, but it did 
<br>
not merit a headline in any major U.S. paper. That must have 
<br>
encouraged the terrorists. Forget about our civilians, we didn't even 
<br>
want to risk our soldiers to face their threats.
<br>
<p>The people who planned Tuesday's bombings combined world-class evil 
<br>
with world-class genius to devastating effect. And unless we are 
<br>
ready to put our best minds to work combating them - the World War 
<br>
III Manhattan project - in an equally daring, unconventional and 
<br>
unremitting fashion, we're in trouble. Because while this may have 
<br>
been the first major battle of World War III, it may be the last one 
<br>
that involves only conventional, non-nuclear weapons.
<br>
<p>Second, we have been allowing a double game to go on with our Middle 
<br>
East allies for years, and that has to stop. A country like Syria has 
<br>
to decide: Does it want a Hezbollah embassy in Damascus or an 
<br>
American one? If it wants a U.S. embassy, then it cannot play host to 
<br>
a rogue's gallery of terrorist groups.
<br>
<p>Does that mean the U.S. must ignore Palestinian concerns and Muslim 
<br>
economic grievances? No. Many in this part of the world crave the 
<br>
best of America, and we cannot forget that we are their ray of hope. 
<br>
But apropos of the Palestinians, the U.S. put on the table at Camp 
<br>
David a plan that would have gotten Yasir Arafat much of what he now 
<br>
claims to be fighting for. That U.S. plan may not be sufficient for 
<br>
Palestinians, but to say that the justifiable response to it is 
<br>
suicide terrorism is utterly sick.
<br>
<p>Third, we need to have a serious and respectful dialogue with the 
<br>
Muslim world and its political leaders about why many of its people 
<br>
are falling behind. The fact is, no region in the world, including 
<br>
sub-Saharan Africa, has fewer freely elected governments than the 
<br>
Arab-Muslim world, which has none. Why? Egypt went through a whole 
<br>
period of self-criticism after the 1967 war, which produced a 
<br>
stronger country. Why is such self-criticism not tolerated today by 
<br>
any Arab leader?
<br>
<p>Where are the Muslim leaders who will tell their sons to resist the 
<br>
Israelis - but not to kill themselves or innocent non-combatants? No 
<br>
matter how bad, your life is sacred. Surely Islam, a grand religion 
<br>
that never perpetrated the sort of Holocaust against the Jews in its 
<br>
midst that Europe did, is being distorted when it is treated as a 
<br>
guidebook for suicide bombing. How is it that not a single Muslim 
<br>
leader will say that?
<br>
<p>These are some of the issues we will have to address as we fight 
<br>
World War III. It will be a long war against a brilliant and 
<br>
motivated foe. When I remarked to an Israeli military official what 
<br>
an amazing technological feat it was for the terrorists to hijack the 
<br>
planes and then fly them directly into the most vulnerable spot in 
<br>
each building, he pooh-poohed me.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's not that difficult to learn how to fly a plane once it's up in 
<br>
the air,&quot; he said. &quot;And remember, they never had to learn how to 
<br>
land.&quot;
<br>
<p>No, they didn't. They only had to destroy. We, by contrast, have to 
<br>
fight in a way that is effective without destroying the very open 
<br>
society we are trying to protect. We have to fight hard and land 
<br>
safely. We have to fight the terrorists as if there were no rules, 
<br>
and preserve our open society as if there were no terrorists. It 
<br>
won't be easy. It will require our best strategists, our most 
<br>
creative diplomats and our bravest soldiers. Semper Fi.
