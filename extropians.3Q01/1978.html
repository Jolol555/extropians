This seems so obvious to me, but why don't those of you who are atheists in want of a &quot;warm and loving&quot; church experience go attend your local Unitarian Universalist church?  I realize Unitarians tend not to &quot;rock the roof&quot; with singing and full-sized bands, but having attended one on occasion I can say they are inclusive and provide lots of food for the mind and &quot;spirit.&quot;
<br>
<p>And for that matter, why couldn't some enterprising UU minister model his/her church in some ways after the Pentacostal model?  Not completely, of course, but just in terms of fellowship, music and loud and exciting sermons.    
<br>
<p>If I were a somewhat different person, I would go to a Unitarian seminary and upon graduation start up a transhumanist UU church.  And we would rock the house... : )  
<br>
<p>&quot;Brother Yudkowsky, TESTIFY of the coming singularity!!&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;AMEN!!&quot;
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
