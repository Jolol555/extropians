I had written, partially tongue in cheek because kids are
<br>
already compelled to attend school
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Olga writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I've already written that reparations to blacks not [!]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; be in cash payments, but in making certain that poor black
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; kids get good schooling in order to help put them on a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; equal playing field.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; One thing that might be done is to forcefully compel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (I know, it's not very libertarian) all black children
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to complete twelve years of schooling at public expense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'd go along with that.
</em><br>
<p>Zero Powers responds
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you mean a quality education such as can be found in your typical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upper-middle class white suburban neighborhood?  Or do you mean the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incarceration that passes for education in many black neighborhoods?
</em><br>
<p>Quite seriously now, I do not believe in the use of force
<br>
to compel parents or guardians to send their children to
<br>
school.  (Again, under desperate circumstances of national
<br>
survival in hypothetical cases, that would change.)
<br>
<p>However, if it is to be granted that states do tax their
<br>
citizens to support public schools, then I believe that
<br>
all schools within a state should be funded equally.  I
<br>
do not know why some schools receive more, exactly.  But
<br>
I'll wager that hardly ever is there a difference within
<br>
a state approaching a factor of two.
<br>
<p>Now will you please answer?  Why is it that when several
<br>
thousand dollars per student is being spent on schools in
<br>
black neighborhoods, this turns out to be &quot;merely incarceration
<br>
that passes for education&quot; as you wrote?  And one more question,
<br>
if you will: do you think that busing, while it was popular,
<br>
did any good?
