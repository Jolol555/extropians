Damien said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;what I'm addressing is the issue Lee raised: the social merits
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of (as I paraphrased it, perhaps unfairly) `inculcating the personal values
</em><br>
<em>&gt;appropriate to the frontier or the 1930s or 1950s'. That is a broader
</em><br>
<em>&gt;social issue, which could only take effect over the next couple of decades.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm saying that with the Spike on the way (which, granted, you dispute) we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probably don't have time--and, more to the point, that subsidizing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incompetent poor at the risk of ruining their moral fiber is a chance worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;taking, since their moral fiber will be toast anyway.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not actually too worried about paying my taxes for &quot;the incompetent 
<br>
poor&quot; or for public infrastructure. On other lists, I often feel like the 
<br>
token mad libertarian, but on this one I sometimes feel a bit like the token 
<br>
&quot;commie&quot;.
<br>
<p>I'd support a guaranteed minimum wage if we could get the economics of it to 
<br>
work, which I can hear a number of people on the list say is a big &quot;if&quot;. In 
<br>
a world of abundance produced by nanotech, it might not be such a big &quot;if&quot; 
<br>
at all.
<br>
<p>I made a comment earlier that I could not see a principled way to stop 
<br>
governments from spending money on schools etc. J.R. shot back a remark 
<br>
about toll roads and private schools, but my thoughts were not about whether 
<br>
there are practical private alternatives to public infrastructure. It was 
<br>
about the central question of political philosophy: the limits of political 
<br>
obligation. I actually think that it's damn hard justifying the state *at 
<br>
all*.
<br>
<p>Now, minarchists want to justify the state but only in so far as it provides 
<br>
protection of life and property, enforces contracts, and keeps out the bad 
<br>
guys in the geographic region next door (or across the other side of the 
<br>
world these days). A minarchist state would have a military, police, a 
<br>
minimalist legal system and a system of courts, but not much more. For 
<br>
example, Nozick's opening chapters of _Anarchy, State and Utopia_ try to 
<br>
steer a middle course between philosophical anarchism and Leviathan, and to 
<br>
justify something like this. I am pretty convinced that they fail. See 
<br>
Robert Paul Wolff's classic article &quot;Robert Nozick's Derivation of the 
<br>
Minimal State&quot; and see what you think.
<br>
<p>I think that the supposedly knock-out, in-principle arguments for 
<br>
libertarianism or minarchism don't work. As far as I can see, we are left 
<br>
with a choice: either we agree with the philosophical anarchists that the 
<br>
problem of political obligation is basically not solvable at all; or we 
<br>
solve it using underlying concepts that are going to give the state more 
<br>
discretion to pass laws, spend money and raise taxes than some of us might 
<br>
want.
<br>
<p>I don't have a clear solution, but I think we are forced back to very deep 
<br>
values such as benevolence and care, as well as the key liberal value of 
<br>
freedom (which needs a lot of unpacking, even if we confine ourselves, as 
<br>
I'm inclined to do, to &quot;negative freedom&quot;). In the upshot, I favour severely 
<br>
limited government but don't rule out on in-principle grounds, i.e. grounds 
<br>
arising from a theory of political obligation, a range of government 
<br>
activity that goes well beyond minarchy. I do reject a lot of government 
<br>
activity that other people (off this list!) consider legitimate, but I'm 
<br>
afraid that the arguments I make are fairly complex.
<br>
<p>I add that the problem of political obligation is at least semi-independent 
<br>
of the economic virtues of either pure capitalism or the current 
<br>
mercantilist system (corporations in cahoots with governments). I can live 
<br>
with the mercantilist system quite happily but don't see how it can be 
<br>
*justified* &lt;g&gt;. Indeed, some kinds of libertarianism would lead to the 
<br>
conclusion that an unregulated capitalist system is the answer, but that the 
<br>
corporate form is not legitimate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From my viewpoint, all this is by the by. I've been trying to keep out of 
</em><br>
the debate about political and economic systems, even though I am interested 
<br>
in the issue and have sufficient libertarian sympathies to be happy enough 
<br>
in the electronic company of Lee, Daniel, Spike, Mike and J.R., etc. I'll 
<br>
continue to resist getting too caught in this thread.
<br>
<p>Anyway, when it gets down to the attitude we should take to the &quot;incompetent 
<br>
poor&quot;, my heart is with Damien, wherever my jurisprudential theorising may 
<br>
be. I'm not too worried about taking away incentives and so on where I see 
<br>
people in real trouble. I might run a pretty tough welfare state if I were 
<br>
in charge but I certainly wouldn't abolish the welfare state.
<br>
<p>None of the above has as much rigour as I'd like, but it'd take several 
<br>
thousand words to nail this down and I, um, don't have a lot of incentive 
<br>
&lt;g&gt; to write them at the moment, when my thoughts are currently more focused 
<br>
on bioethical issues.
<br>
