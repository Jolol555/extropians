<em>&gt; &gt;Well, I expect to change your mind with one question: If a liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;education is to make a citizen fit to live in a democracy, why is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it that there are more citizens than ever who are completely UNFIT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to live in a democracy, and it is ENTIRELY the fault of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;educational system?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike what we have in schools today is education by political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberals, which is a completely different thing from a classic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberal education. &quot;Liberal&quot; in the educational sense is almost the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposite of &quot;liberal&quot; in the political sense.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but this is now. When we handed over the reins to the teachers
<br>
union and the gummint, 95% of the kids were getting some significant
<br>
amount of classical liberal education. Now the number is around 30-40%,
<br>
and that is specifically because of the public educational system. If it
<br>
were'nt for private schools, that number would be around 10-20%. This
<br>
decay is specifically the fault of the public school system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Skilled non-degree jobs go begging to be filled, machinists being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;just the easiest to point to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tell me about it, we've been trying to hire replacement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communications electricians for months with little success. People
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't as interested in these jobs as they used to be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this is besides the point, we still need people who are highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; educated and good critical thinkers in this country, every citizen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be so equipped.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course this is what politicians fear most.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, which is why giving politicians control of our kids education
<br>
is definitely a case of leaving the fox in charge of the henhouse.
