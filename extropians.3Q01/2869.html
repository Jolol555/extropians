<em>&gt; &gt; Actually, it is totally libertarian to pay such taxes, but only if they

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Refusing to pay your externalities is not libertarian, and IS imposing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; force on others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would remain to be proven that such taxes actually reflect externalities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But even so, the libertarian way of dealing with externalities is through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property rights and voluntary agreement -- not through taxes.  See, e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Roy Cordato's _Welfare Economics and Externalities in an Open Ended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Universe_ and Robert Ellickson's _Order Without Law: How Neighbors Settle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Disputes_.
</em><br>
<p>Ultimately, in the anarcho-capitalist end of the libertarian spectrum,
<br>
you would be correct. However, the only recognizable difference between
<br>
a libertarian government and a libertarian ungoverned territory is that
<br>
you will have to deal with various insurance providers who will mitigate
<br>
this, i.e. only a difference of monopoly versus free market providers of
<br>
externalities mitigation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Note for those who don't know what externalities are:  They are costs or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits passed on to others without their consent.  Usually, the ones of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest are negative externalities -- i.e., costs passed onto to other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without their consent.  An example is air pollution.  People usually don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complain about positive externalities.  An example is someone beautifying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their property.  This might provide benefits to his or her neighbors -- in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms of property value increase, a more esthetically pleasing neighborhood,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the like.)
</em><br>
<p>In a libertarian context, if, for example, I improve my property, I
<br>
could go to each of my neighbors that would benefit from my
<br>
improvements, and say: &quot;either pay your share of the value of my
<br>
improvement, or sign this waiver of your right to litigate against my
<br>
improvements, or we go to court&quot; (obviously in a more polite manner than
<br>
this).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; A libertarian government properly focuses its revinue gathering on use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; based taxation, while fascist governments focus on confiscatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; taxation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; A libertarian government would not be able to tax period.  It might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; to charge user fees, but these would be for services the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; delivers.  A government doesn't deliver a service by forcing people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pay a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; tax.  This would include registration fees.  What if I don't want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; register?  (A libertarian government might disavow protecting, say, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; car
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; against theft or vandalism if I don't register it, but it would not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; to use force to make me register.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A libertarian government would impose taxes to account for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; externalities, and would properly funnel those externality fees to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mitigate the damage created by those externalities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This claim needs a lot more justification than that.  How would a government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find out what really were externalities?  (Would it be able to determine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this any better than the market?  If so, how?  If it could do this, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; submit, it would be a case for socialism.  Not that that's bad in itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it makes me think it's not possible.)  How would it find out their exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount?  (If it charged more, it would be aggressing.  If it charged less,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then, by your standards, it would be allowing aggression.)
</em><br>
<p>Well, for example, gasoline makers/sellers would have to pay the cost of
<br>
CO2 mitigation, which they could pass on to their customers however they
<br>
wished:
<br>
<p>a) flat rate per gallon
<br>
b) graduated amount based on the vehicles own consumption and emissions
<br>
<p>Similarly, roads could all be privatized today with remote smartcard
<br>
technology paying tolls to road owners remotely, or simply collected by
<br>
an autoclub / road cooperative based on the vehicle's milage. Vehicles
<br>
which do not provide milage data or billing information get stopped by
<br>
private cops until they provide a billing address and/or insurance
<br>
provider that checks out, and failure to pay results in vehicle
<br>
impoundment.
<br>
<p>Remember, libertarians society DOES NOT lack coersion, it simply applies
<br>
coersion to those who attempt to initiate it themselves. Self defense is
<br>
justified in all situations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if it could overcome these very real knowledge problems, would its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incentives be in the direction of actually limiting itself to this and only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this?
</em><br>
<p>We obviously cannot hash all of these things out here. Considering the
<br>
level to which insurance providers already deal with these sorts of
<br>
problems day in and out, I don't think this would be all that difficult.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; That said, your semilibertarian -- and it is that: only partly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; libertarian -- government might be better than what we have now in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; on Earth, but it falls short of the principles you claim to be upholding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; It mgiht be a good interim setup, between today's welfare state and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; tomorrow's libertarian society, but it should not be the goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; SOrry, a society that does not create some means of properly mitigating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; externalities is not, and cannot hope to be in any way, libertarian.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The proper way of mitigating _negative_ externalities is through defining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property rights and through voluntary agreements.  E.g., if my next door
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighbor decides to throw a party that will interfere with my sleep, he and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can come to an understanding that I'll have some warning and maybe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the music won't go past midnight.  (Or he might invite me over.  Not all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems are so easily solved, but force should not be the first line of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem solving in these cases.)
</em><br>
<p>Of course, but this assumes the individual has all voluntary agreements
<br>
ironed out ahead of time, or has the concientiousness to do so through
<br>
their PPL. When individuals go around blithely acting without such
<br>
agreements set, they need to either provide a means to come to an
<br>
agreement, or else deal with force acting in self defense against their
<br>
own initiation of force, imposing externalities on people.
