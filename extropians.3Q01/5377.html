<br>
<p><em>&gt; To say that a theory is approximately true might commit one to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some notion of verisimilitude but why certainty? 
</em><br>
<p>Because why use the word &quot;approximately&quot; unless one was trying
<br>
to prevent the listener from thinking &quot;absolutely&quot;?  That all
<br>
of our theories are, OF COURSE, only approximate should not
<br>
need to be said.  To even think differently reveals a sore
<br>
misapprehension of how things work.  We should unhesitatingly
<br>
say &quot;planets move around the sun in ellipses&quot;, &quot;ice melts at
<br>
32 degrees Fahrenheit&quot;, &quot;continents float on underlying strata&quot;,
<br>
&quot;heavy objects fall at the same rate as light objects&quot;, and all
<br>
the other very hard-won pieces of scientific knowledge.
<br>
<p>So you think that some of these are simply true, and don't
<br>
need further elaboration?  Then work on this one:  &quot;heavy
<br>
objects in the Earth's gravity do *not* fall at the same
<br>
rate as light objects, but actually fall faster&quot;.  This is
<br>
true, but is stupid and useless sophistry (as I'll explain
<br>
in another paragraph, below).
<br>
<p>Kepler's discovery that planets move in ellipses is so wonderful,
<br>
so profound, and so revolutionary that it is a crime to say
<br>
&quot;planets move only *approximately!* in elliptical orbits&quot;.
<br>
Perfect accuracy for sentences is a chimera.  &quot;The Earth is
<br>
round&quot; actually conveys more intelligence per syllable than
<br>
&quot;the Earth is approximately spherical&quot; does.  
<br>
<p>As promised, if you didn't figure it out, the reason that some
<br>
pedantic moronic sophist could argue that heavy objects fall
<br>
faster than light objects is that if we take into account the
<br>
tiny force of the objects on the Earth as well as the
<br>
force of the Earth on the objects, we see that F is slightly
<br>
greater in the case of the heavy object!  But, as I say, anyone
<br>
who burst into an elementary school room and shouts &quot;That's wrong!&quot;
<br>
when the teacher says that heavy and light objects fall at the
<br>
same speeds, should be prosecuted.
