<p>I think you hit upon several of JR's useless concepts above. Scientific
<br>
psychology began exorcising them after 1879 and by the time of Watson's
<br>
seminal 1913 Psych Review paper, the ghost in the machine had been
<br>
thoroughly exorcised. If it cannot be reliably observed and therefore
<br>
measured it aint in the domain of science. AI researchers often chase
<br>
after ghosts because they haven't studied real human intelligence and
<br>
especially the work of 5 generations of smart people who dedicated
<br>
lifelong careers to spelling out observable-measurable-testable
<br>
intelligence. If you discover some kind of observable-measurable-testable
<br>
intelligence which is significant and hasn't been reported since 1879,
<br>
then rush to get your ideas published in a psych journal. You will be
<br>
famous. It is as likely that this will happen as the discovery of a new
<br>
species of mammal at this time. But don't give up...Sasquatch hunting is a
<br>
big tourism draw in BC.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, if you have a machine which gives the answers/solutions a la
<br>
JR's definition (which is as good as any) then it meets the human
<br>
equivalency criterion. Period. Now let's go back to Hawking. All kinds of
<br>
math-like tests are used to assess human intelligence. Is there any reason
<br>
a robo-mathematician couldn't answer all question and give all solutions
<br>
as well as Hawking?
<br>
