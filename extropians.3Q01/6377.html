<em>&gt;From: Miriam English &lt;<a href="mailto:miriam@werple.net.au?Subject=Re:%20Rotting%20in%20hell&In-Reply-To=&lt;200109131937.MAA20085@well.com&gt;">miriam@werple.net.au</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;That is a little unfair. They have been serious about peace for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very long time.
</em><br>
<p>This is a ridiculous statement. Everything they've been doing for
<br>
years, especially the last year, has been the exact opposite of
<br>
peace. Rock throwing? Terrorist attacks?
<br>
<p>What they want is to have their way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Try cramming a heap of US citizens into a tiny and deprived space
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with appalling restrictions upon their normal movement, with most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of what you would consider essential rights taken away by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;faceless, brutal soldiers and see if those US citizens would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;peaceful. *Of course* some of the  Palestinians have gone for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;violent solution, what else could be expected? Many normally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enlightened members of this list have been braying for incredible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and truly terrifying violent solutions lately.
</em><br>
<p>You have a double standard.
<br>
<p>It's perfectly understandable to you that the Palestinians use
<br>
violence and terrorism to try and achieve their aims, but those who
<br>
have to use violence to defend themselves are the bad guys
<br>
<p>I'll ignore the braying remark for now, next time it's sig file
<br>
time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The Palestinians are just people. They are the same as the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the other side of the border. When you forget that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people then you can justify atrocities... exactly the same way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those fools who rode the airplanes into the WTC did.
</em><br>
<p>I see them as people, people who won't listen to reason, people who
<br>
think they can get away with using terrorism for political aims.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The image of them cheering is hard to get rid of.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Which is probably why the clip was played over and over again...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or maybe I am wording that wrongly. I should probably say that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;viewers were played by those that screened the tape of those kids.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It was guaranteed to get a nasty reaction. It almost certainly was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not representative. So, why do you think they showed it?
</em><br>
<p>Actually I only saw it once, but that was enough. It was being
<br>
broadcast by international media and was picked up here. 
<br>
<p>The theatrics of the Palestinians happened after we know they saw
<br>
broadcasts of American reaction to the dancing in the street bit.
<br>
<p>Which is why it carries little weight here.
