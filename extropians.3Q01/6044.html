<br>
<p><p>Visitors traditionally test a city's pulse by polling its cabbies. Too poor
<br>
for this method, I spy on bus drivers. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sole passenger, I drowsed as the Sydney driver punched his radio tetchily
<br>
from one pop music grab to the next. He lingered at a news spot, until a
<br>
scientist started telling us about the algal bloom running amok in local
<br>
waterways. `I don't *give* a shit,' cried the driver in fury, and smote the
<br>
boring wretch into oblivion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for science as a spectator sport.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Professor Stephen Hawking's quite difficult treatise on
<br>
quantum cosmology, A Brief History of Time, has sold some 10 million copies
<br>
world-wide. Hawking argues that the universe, while finite, has no
<br>
boundaries in space or time, that it is a self-caused `vacuum fluctuation'
<br>
out of nowhere. A Spielberg movie of the book combines visual splendor with
<br>
the pathos and courage of its crippled, voiceless author. Unless a lot of
<br>
horror fans are misreading Stephen Hawking for Stephen King, something
<br>
startling (and commendable) is going on here. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is Hawking just the latest victim of misplaced hopes in a world where
<br>
science displaces God? White and Gribbin start with Shirley Maclaine's
<br>
pilgrimage to the shrunken sage. Perhaps Hawking's book `has sold so well
<br>
because it has been latched on to by a lost generation of post-yuppie
<br>
Greens who see it as a symbol of new-age wisdom, that it somehow takes on
<br>
semi-religious importance in their minds.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Producer David Hickman confirms this opinion: `The most exciting thing
<br>
about cosmology is the fact that it interfaces metaphysics and conventional
<br>
science. It's very interesting that Stephen has attracted a lot of
<br>
attention over the religious aspects of his work, as well as the fact that
<br>
he is close to a number of physicists with deep theological concerns.' 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Of course,' observe White and Gribbin, `Hawking finds such notions
<br>
hilarious.... Throughout his work, Hawking's early agnosticism had become
<br>
more overtly atheistic, and with his no-boundary theory he had effectively
<br>
dispensed with the notion of God altogether.' Hawking's spectacularly
<br>
devoted wife Jane, by contrast, is a devout Christian, and his amused
<br>
dismissal of religious faith is certainly one reason why their 25-year
<br>
marriage came to an end in 1990 when he left to live with his nurse.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quantum mechanics, with its intractable challenges to common sense, has
<br>
been colonized lately by cabalists. See here, they say, causality itself -
<br>
the very principle of conventional reason - breaks down in the realm of the
<br>
very small. Cosmology tells us that the universe was once compressed to the
<br>
size of a sub-atomic particle, and hence subject to quantum weirdness. The
<br>
brain itself uses near-quantal neurons. Doesn't this free us from rigid
<br>
patriarchal determinism, loosing the joys of quantum mysticism?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Only to the sloppy and the mischievous, who borrow no more than the
<br>
trappings of this arcane discipline.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his magisterial life of Niels Bohr, the pioneer who oversaw the
<br>
invention of quantum methods in the 1920s and 1930s, Professor Abraham Pais
<br>
declares at the outset: `I hope that the present account will serve to
<br>
counteract the many cheap attempts at popularizing this subject, such as
<br>
efforts by woolly masters at linking quantum physics to mysticism.' 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bohr was explicit. He insisted that his new quantum methods could be
<br>
presented `without risking being misunderstood that it should be the
<br>
purpose to introduce a mysticism which is alien to the spirit of natural
<br>
science.' 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor was his central idea of complementarity - that fundamental entities
<br>
are neither waves nor particles, but either, depending on the experiment
<br>
you perform - prompted by oriental philosophy, as books like The Tao of
<br>
Physics assert. True, Bohr took the Yin-Yang symbol for his coat-of-arms,
<br>
but the icon was suggested by the wife of a colleague. And Bohr held no
<br>
brief for faith. `He was sorry for the role religion played,' said his
<br>
wife. `He thought it was not good for human beings to hold on to things
<br>
which were, as nearly as one could see, not true.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the furthest extreme from this demand that all things must be graspable
<br>
by pure reason is the dazzling work of Srinivasa Ramanujan Iyengar, a
<br>
virtually self-taught Indian mathematical genius born two years after Bohr
<br>
(in 1887). The Dane Bohr was a patrician in a nation separated by language
<br>
and culture from the German and Anglo-American strongholds of physics, and
<br>
his genius delivered him the Nobel Prize in 1922 (at 37) `for his
<br>
investigations of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating
<br>
from them'. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramanujan (pronounced Ram-AHN-uh-jum) was an impoverished Brahmin who died
<br>
of tuberculosis at 32, two years before Bohr got his prize, who `grew up
<br>
praying to stone deities; who for most of his life took counsel from a
<br>
family goddess, declaring it was she to whom his mathematical insights were
<br>
owed; whose theorems would, at intellectually backbreaking cost, be proved
<br>
true - yet leave mathematicians baffled that anyone could divine them in
<br>
the first place.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three lives, each radiant with intellectual power and an aesthetic
<br>
grandeur no non-specialist (like me) can ever truly appreciate, circle upon
<br>
each other, twisting through a hidden dimension of poignancy and resonance.
<br>
If Ramanujan's life began unpromisingly and ended in stupid tragedy, it had
<br>
astonishing triumphs. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This slate-scribbling mathematician, too poor for paper, erasing his
<br>
errors with one dirty elbow as he sat cross-legged, failing his studies,
<br>
managed even so to attract the notice of G. H. Hardy, a leading English
<br>
mathematician. Hardy fetched him to the dreaming quads of Cambridge, got
<br>
him the glory of Fellowship in the Royal Society, toiled with others to
<br>
turn Ramanujan's exotic notation into standard publishable form. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet he failed to see that Brahmin dietary restrictions, in a country
<br>
without abundant sun, fruit and vegetables, were slowly killing his friend.
<br>
If piety destroyed Ramanujan, it spat upon him after his death. `At the
<br>
funeral, most of his orthodox Brahmin relatives stayed away.' He had
<br>
crossed water in going to England and, too ill for purification ceremonies,
<br>
`was still tainted in their eyes.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, religious experiences evoked Ramanujan's finest work on infinite
<br>
series. `After seeing in dreams the drops of blood that... heralded the
<br>
presence of the god Narasimha, the male consort of the goddess Namagiri,
<br>
&quot;scrolls containing the most complicated mathematics used to unfold before
<br>
his eyes&quot;.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powerful insight often has irrational roots. Pivotal breakthroughs in
<br>
atomic physics were the fruit of mistakes. `In retrospect,' Pais says,
<br>
`these many successes are all the more fabulous and astounding because they
<br>
are based on analogies - atomic orbits similar to the motions of the
<br>
planets around the sun, and spin similar to the rotation of the planets
<br>
while orbiting - which are in fact false.' 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the physicist Sommerfeld produced a crucial formula which was
<br>
correct though its derivation, Pais notes, `is wide of the mark. With good
<br>
reason... this derivation has been called &quot;perhaps the most remarkable
<br>
numerical coincidence in the history of physics&quot;.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precisely because science advances in fits and starts from error, Stephen
<br>
Hawking, today's equivalent of Bohr and Ramanujan, favours the method of
<br>
conjecture and refutation. The source of good ideas is irrelevant; what
<br>
counts is whether a notion can withstand ferocious criticism. Hawking's own
<br>
brief history is a cascade of wonderful ideas advanced, demolished (usually
<br>
by himself), replaced, tested under renewed pressure, replaced again... Yet
<br>
his goal is a Theory of Everything.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all this ceaseless remaking, paradox battles paradigm. As Kitty
<br>
Ferguson puts it in her small, lively book (better written and less
<br>
expensive than the Viking collaboration, weighed down by White's shockingly
<br>
amateur prose), `two great scientific theories taken together seem to give
<br>
us nonsense; empty space isn't empty; black holes aren't black; and a man
<br>
whose appearance inspires shock and pity takes us laughing to where the
<br>
boundaries of time and space ought to be - but are not.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My bus driver will not be impressed, but for many others these books -
<br>
especially Kanigel's capable and moving double portrait of Ramanujan and
<br>
Hardy - will enrich heart no less than mind, sparking imagination in a
<br>
pleasure deep as music or art can offer.
