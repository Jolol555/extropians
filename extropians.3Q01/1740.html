<p>This is all really besides the point:  until MNT et al comes to pass,
<br>
the basic resources necessary for a comfortable life will be
<br>
scarce--by necessity (and even then I would imagine that all sorts of
<br>
laws meant to prop-up present wealth will fight against it). 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The reason for this is that the worth of the green money held in the
<br>
bank (and the various equivalents thereof (real estate etc)) have
<br>
worth only to the degree to which they are desired by other human
<br>
beings.  If I have much money in the bank, but there is lessening
<br>
desire for it by others, then my money is worth less.  In order for
<br>
the value of my money to increase, I must increase the demand for it.
<br>
One way to do that is to ensure that the cost of things that
<br>
constitute a &quot;comfortable life&quot; remain as costly as possible.  
<br>
<p>An example is housing.  Given the relative level of sophistication of
<br>
manufacturing methods, I would wager that comfortable homes could be
<br>
cheaply manufactured in Mexico and shipped here. Never mind the
<br>
current model/style of moble home:  simply consider the possiblities
<br>
in the realm of very cheap modular housing.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;But prevailing laws prevent that.  Look as an example at the many
<br>
laws against the placement and moving of mobile homes.  I doubt you
<br>
are even aware of the scope and magnitude of these laws. And never
<br>
mind zoning and housing associations...
<br>
<p>These laws act to prop up the values of current ocuppied and future
<br>
homes--at the expense of those without a home.  So now the 60% or so
<br>
of people own homes in the USA can prop-up their own wealth... at the
<br>
expense of others. Many of these &quot;others&quot; can be seen sleeping under
<br>
bridges.
<br>
<p>The recent  removal of barriers to immigration into the USA help to
<br>
prop up property values and therefore preserve the wealth of those
<br>
that are land owners, and conversely, help to empty the pockets of
<br>
those that are not landowners.  Those green pieces of paper fly out of
<br>
the pockets of the landless and into the pockets of the landed. With
<br>
more people coming into the country, more green pieces of paper are
<br>
flying.  
<br>
<p>Medical care is another of the pillars of a &quot;comfortable life&quot;.  I
<br>
note that the physician lobby acted a few years ago to limit the
<br>
supply of doctors.  The accompanying propaganda was laughable...
<br>
<p>I could go on and on. But the main idea is that the resources held by
<br>
anyone are valued by the scarcity of those resources.  That should be
<br>
obvious!  Therefore in order for the vast of majority of wealth to
<br>
exist, there MUST be scarcity of resources.  Of course there are
<br>
exceptions due to the unstoppable advance science and manufacturing
<br>
methods: cheap computers,etc...
<br>
<p>Ehrenbach is completely right (in her recent book _Nickled and Dimed_
<br>
which detailed her sojourns as a low paid worker) when she said that
<br>
we all exploit these low paid workers.  In fact, our own wealth and
<br>
status depends upon their presence. If they were not poor and working
<br>
to obtain the resources we possess, much of our wealth would be
<br>
worthless.... just pieces of green paper.
