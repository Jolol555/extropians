<p>A Scientist's Art: Computer Fiction
<br>
<p>By KATIE HAFNER
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AN DIEGO -- VERNOR VINGE, a computer scientist at San
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diego State University, was one of the first not only to
<br>
understand the power of computer networks but also to paint
<br>
elaborate scenarios about their effects on society. He has long argued
<br>
that machine intelligence will someday soon outstrip human
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>But Dr. Vinge does not publish technical papers on those topics. He
<br>
writes science fiction.
<br>
<p>And in turning computer fact into published fiction, Dr. Vinge
<br>
(pronounced VIN-jee) has developed a readership so convinced of
<br>
his prescience that businesses seek his help in envisioning and
<br>
navigating the decades to come.
<br>
<p>&quot;Vernor can live, as few can, in the future,&quot; said Lawrence
<br>
Wilkinson, co-founder of Global Business Network, which
<br>
specializes in corporate planning. &quot;He can imagine extensions and
<br>
elaborations on reality that aren't provable, of course, but that are
<br>
consistent with what we know.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr. Vinge's 1992 novel, &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot; (Tor Books), which
<br>
won the prestigious Hugo Award for science fiction, is a grand
<br>
&quot;space opera&quot; set 40,000 years in a future filled with unfathomable
<br>
distances, the destruction of entire planetary systems and doglike
<br>
aliens. A reviewer in The Washington Post (news/quote) called it &quot;a
<br>
wide-screen science fiction epic of the type few writers attempt any
<br>
more, probably because nobody until Vinge has ever done it well.&quot;
<br>
<p>But computers, not aliens, were at the center of the work that put Dr.
<br>
Vinge on the science fiction map - &quot;True Names,&quot; a 30,000-word
<br>
novella that offered a vision of a networked world. It was published
<br>
in 1981, long before most people had heard of the Internet and a year
<br>
before William Gibson's story &quot;Burning Chrome&quot; coined the term
<br>
that has come to describe such a world: cyberspace.
<br>
<p>For years, even as its renown has grown, &quot;True Names&quot; has been out
<br>
of print and hard to find. Now it is being reissued by Tor Books in
<br>
&quot;True Names and the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier,&quot; a
<br>
collection of stories and essays by computer scientists that is due out
<br>
in December.
<br>
<p>&quot;True Names&quot; is the tale of Mr. Slippery, a computer vandal who is
<br>
caught by the government and pressed into service to stop a threat
<br>
greater than himself. The story portrays a world rife with
<br>
pseudonymous characters and other elements of online life that now
<br>
seem almost ho-hum. In retrospect, it was prophetic.
<br>
<p>&quot;The import of `True Names,' &quot; wrote Marvin Minsky, a pioneer in
<br>
artificial intelligence, in an afterword to an early edition of the work,
<br>
&quot;is that it is about how we cope with things we don't understand.&quot;
<br>
<p>And computers are at the center of Dr. Vinge's vision of the
<br>
challenges that the coming decades will bring. A linchpin of his
<br>
thinking is what he calls the &quot;technological singularity,&quot; a point at
<br>
which the intelligence of machines takes a huge leap, and they come
<br>
to possess capabilities that exceed those of humans. As a result,
<br>
ultra- intelligent machines become capable of upgrading themselves,
<br>
humans cease to be the primary players, and the future becomes
<br>
unknowable.
<br>
<p>Dr. Vinge sees the singularity as probable if not inevitable, most
<br>
likely arriving between 2020 and 2040.
<br>
<p>Indeed, any conversation with Dr. Vinge, 56, inevitably turns to the
<br>
singularity. It is a preoccupation he recognizes with self-effacing
<br>
humor as &quot;my usual shtick.&quot;
<br>
<p>Although he has written extensively about the singularity as a
<br>
scientific concept, he is humble about laying intellectual claim to it.
<br>
In fact, with titles like &quot;Approximation by Faber Polynomials for a
<br>
Class of Jordan Domains&quot; and &quot;Teaching FORTH on a VAX,&quot; Dr.
<br>
Vinge's academic papers bear little resemblance to the topics he
<br>
chooses for his fiction.
<br>
<p>&quot;The ideas about the singularity and the future of computation are
<br>
things that basically occurred to me on the basis of my experience of
<br>
what I know about computers,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>&quot;And although that is at a professional level, it's not because of some
<br>
great research insight I had or even a not-so-great research insight I
<br>
had. It's because I've been watching these things and I like to think
<br>
about where things could go.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr. Vinge readily concedes that his worldview has been shaped by
<br>
science fiction, which he has been reading and writing since
<br>
childhood. His dream, he said, was to be a scientist, and &quot;the science
<br>
fiction was just part of the dreaming.&quot;
<br>
<p>Trained as a mathematician, Dr. Vinge said he did not begin &quot;playing
<br>
with real computers&quot; until the early 1970's, after he had started
<br>
teaching at San Diego State. His teaching gradually shifted to
<br>
computer science, focusing on computer networks and distributed
<br>
systems. He received tenure in 1977.
<br>
<p>&quot;Teaching networks and operating systems was a constant source of
<br>
story inspiration,&quot; Dr. Vinge said. The idea for &quot;True Names&quot; came
<br>
from an exchange he had one day in the late 1970's while using an
<br>
early form of instant messaging called Talk.
<br>
<p>&quot;Suddenly I was accosted by another user via the Talk program,&quot; he
<br>
recalled. &quot;We chatted briefly, each trying to figure out the other's
<br>
true name. Finally I gave up and told the other person I had to go -
<br>
that I was actually a personality simulator, and if I kept talking, my
<br>
artificial nature would become obvious. Afterwards I realized that I
<br>
had just lived a science fiction story.&quot;
<br>
<p>Computers and artificial intelligence are, of course, at the center of
<br>
much science fiction, including the current Steven Spielberg film,
<br>
&quot;A.I.&quot; In the Spielberg vision, a robotic boy achieves a different sort
<br>
of singularity: parity with humans not just in intelligence but in
<br>
emotion, too. &quot;To me, the big leap of faith is to make that little boy,&quot;
<br>
Dr. Vinge said. &quot;We don't have evidence of progress toward that. If it
<br>
ever happens, there will be a runaway effect, and getting to
<br>
something a whole lot better than human will happen really fast.&quot;
<br>
<p>How fast? &quot;Maybe 36 hours,&quot; Dr. Vinge replied.
<br>
<p>Dr. Vinge's own work has yet to make it to the screen, although
<br>
&quot;True Names&quot; has been under option for five years. &quot;It's been a long
<br>
story of my trying to convince studio executives to really consider
<br>
the work seriously because it seemed so far out,&quot; said David Baxter, a
<br>
Hollywood writer and producer who is writing the screenplay with
<br>
Mark Pesce, co-creator of Virtual Reality Modeling Language, or
<br>
VRML. &quot;But as time has passed, the world has started to match what
<br>
was in the book.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the meantime Dr. Vinge has been providing scenarios in the
<br>
corporate world as well. He is one of several science fiction writers
<br>
who have worked with Global Business Network in anticipating
<br>
future situations and plotting strategies for several major companies.
<br>
<p>Mr. Wilkinson, the co-founder of Global Business Network, said
<br>
that Dr. Vinge's work with the group provided &quot;an unbelievably
<br>
fertile perspective from which to look back at and reunderstand the
<br>
present.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;It's that ability to conceptualize whole new ways of framing issues,
<br>
whole new contexts that could emerge,&quot; Mr. Wilkinson said. &quot;In the
<br>
process he has contributed to the turnarounds of at least two
<br>
well-known technology companies.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr. Vinge, shy and reserved, is hardly a self-promoter. He
<br>
scrupulously assigns credit to others whenever he can. And although
<br>
he insists that much of his work is highly derivative, his fans do not
<br>
necessarily share that view.
<br>
<p>&quot;The thing that distinguishes Vernor is he's a scientist and all of his
<br>
stuff makes sense,&quot; Mr. Baxter said. &quot;It's all grounded in the here
<br>
and now.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr. Vinge is now a professor emeritus at San Diego State, having
<br>
retired to devote his time to his writing and consulting. Over lunch
<br>
at a restaurant not far from the university, he described a story he
<br>
was working on.
<br>
<p>&quot;Well, there's a recovering Alzheimer's patient,&quot; Dr. Vinge began,
<br>
before being interrupted and asked how one could be a recovering
<br>
Alzheimer's patient.
<br>
<p>His eyes brightened. &quot;You can't,&quot; he said, and a sly smile crossed his
<br>
face. &quot;Yet.&quot;
