<p>There's fiber, and there's fiber. Monomode is nice, but the new hollow
<br>
core fiber promises to be able to lick the NLO effects setting an upper
<br>
limit to fibre's capacity.
<br>
<p>I'm still surprised that fiber is not seen as a basic infrastructure, such
<br>
as gas, electricity, canalization. The costs of the fiber itself is
<br>
relatively insignificant, if compared with the earthworks, and the people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; years of Moore's Law-like doubling of bandwidth/utility demands maxes

<p>Bandwidth grows runs rings even around Moore. I hope we'll be getting
<br>
hollow fibre and purely photonical switches soon.

<p>CAT 5 or CAT 7? Even with copper, there are differences. Of course, right
<br>
now I wouldn't lay copper anywhere, unless budget limited. Fiber, at the
<br>
very least multimode fiber (good for up to 10 GBps at short range).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was installing the hookups in the President's office and chatting with

<p>The speed of the network is not terribly important, once you're past a
<br>
certain threshold. Of course, that threshold is pushed back continuously
<br>
due to the protocol bloat..
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Nah, you gotta account for Moore's law, see, where bandwidth doubles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every year and a half. Right now you guys have a 1 mb/sec network that's
</em><br>

<p>If they'd use CAT 7 instead of CAT 5 they could upgrade to GBit Ethernet,
<br>
when the NICs and the switches become more affordable (right now they're
<br>
an order of magnitude more expensive, and the switch costs/port are even
<br>
worse).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; employer had not either accounted for this doubling, or else had not
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; or those who were aware of it were keeping their mouths shut, expecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such info to not get out until the network was bought and installed....)
</em><br>
<p>For many small companies, 10 MBit coax will still do. Anything is better
<br>
than sneakernet.
