<p>Um... Ortega may be digestible if one would be willing to go through a lot
<br>
of old Latinamerican left-wing fossil ideology. At least he seems basically
<br>
decent, if of dubious use for the kind of problems we have in the region.
<br>
Now, Chavez... *shudder* The guy is a goon, an opportunist, and a sly
<br>
version of what is worst about traditional authoritarian nationalism in
<br>
LA. Asking one to choose between the globalization oligarchy and this
<br>
kind of localist creep is like giving one the option of choosing between
<br>
being hanged or shot. In the end, we are equally &quot;dead to the future&quot;.
<br>
<p>(A brief Argentine digression: we have around our country the same kind
<br>
of character as this Chavez fellow. They have dabbled into politics, with
<br>
relative success on local elections. To be honest, they scare the living
<br>
daylights out of me, and if such people would get to power in Argentina
<br>
(a not too far possibility, considering the mess we are in and how
<br>
gullible scared people can be there) I would very much give my country
<br>
for lost for any practical purposes and several decades to come.)
