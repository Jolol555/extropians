<em>&gt; One question I had was how long the immunity lasts. If you were vaccinated

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>I called the immunization division of my state's department of health. The
<br>
woman I talked to said that there is some residual immunity even after ten
<br>
years (one might get the disease but would have a milder case than someone
<br>
who had never been vaccinated) and that a 2nd vaccination is thought to
<br>
strenghten the immunity, though she didn't know of any specific research
<br>
done on this. I was first vaccinated when I was a small child and again when
<br>
I was in my mid 20's and visited a country where small pox had not yet been
<br>
eradicated. I had no reaction to the second vaccination, which indicated I
<br>
was still immune after more than 20 years.
<br>
<p>I was interested in getting a vaccination for my daughter, who was born
<br>
after small pox was eradicated world-wide and was told that there is no
<br>
serum available for the general public. None at all, not for any price, not
<br>
anywhere in the world.
<br>
<p>I asked if cow pox still exists &quot;in the wild&quot; and didn't get a clear answer.
