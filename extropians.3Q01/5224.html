<em>&gt; &gt;I entirely agree, and thank you for pointing that out. In contrast to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;capitalism, one might consider the educational benefits of socialism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;especially famous socialist teachers such as Stalin, who taught 30,000,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;people how to die, or National Socialist Adolph Hitler who graduated tens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;millions in his special education classes. Then there was the Maoist brand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;socialist education that taught many more millions of  students how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;starve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to death..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Responsible and intelligent people should always remember the lessons that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;socialism teaches.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think anyone here is advocating socialism.  I certainly am not.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are alternatives other than unregulated markets on one hand and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totalitarian socialist regimes on the other.  Though die hard libertarians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will disagree, free enterprise mixed with a spoonful of socially responsible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regulation can go a long way.
</em><br>
<p>Why slaughter the productive cow when you can chain her and hitch her
<br>
teats up for milking, eh? What makes you think the cow prefers, or
<br>
thrives best under, either alternative? I'm sure there were some slave
<br>
laborers under Speer who thought they were getting a better deal than
<br>
those already in the ditch. Why, they should even be grateful for the
<br>
opportunity to serve in a socially responsible, regulated way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unrestrained capitalism (think early industrial US) leads to huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discrepancies in the distribution of wealth, which leads to social unrest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (think the early labor movement) and even upheaval (think French
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Revolution).
</em><br>
<p>This is a misrepresentation. The French Revolution (and all revolutions,
<br>
generally) arise from the upper class members in power who conflict
<br>
violently with middle and upper class members who are not in power. The
<br>
masses are generally pawns in the political game of the factions.
<br>
Whoever offers the most largesse from the public purse generally wins,
<br>
unless the opposition posesses superior generalship in the field.
