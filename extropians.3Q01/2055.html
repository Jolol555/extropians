<em>&gt; Wow.  An extropian complaining that an elaborate analysis of the

<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...My attitude is to draw tentative conclusions

</em><br>
<p>(Seems your attitude attepmted divergence during the SETI/ASTRO

<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, a more complex model can *validate* a simpler one...

<p>Not according to Anders...but, whatever.

Earth Likely to Warm 4-7 Degrees by 2100
<br>
New estimates of sulfur dioxide and other emissions, along with updated
<br>
information on carbon storage, ocean circulation, radiation, and other
<br>
components of the earth system have improved computer models of the
<br>
earth's
<br>
climate and led the IPCC to both raise and widen its estimated range of
<br>
global temperature increase. The latest range of 2.5-10.4 degree F is up
<br>
significantly from the panel's 1995 estimates of 1.4-6.3 degree.
<br>
<p>In their analysis Wigley and Raper attempted to interpret the likelihood
<br>
of
<br>
the new estimates, taking into account the wide uncertainties about
<br>
future
<br>
human activities and the climate's response to them. They identified the
<br>
main sources of uncertainty and estimated the probability of their
<br>
values
<br>
falling within defined ranges. They then used these results to &quot;drive&quot; a
<br>
simplified climate model and combined the various model results into
<br>
probability ranges for temperature increases

World land database charts a troubling course
<br>
AMSTERDAM -- Over the past 300 years, in an ever-accelerating process,
<br>
humans have reshaped the terrestrial surface of the Earth. In doing so,
<br>
humanity has scripted a scenario of global environmental change with
<br>
impacts
<br>
that promise to be at least as severe as global climate change,
<br>
scientists
<br>
reported here today, July 11

<p>Watch global warming happen in real time - on Mars
<br>
Though there has been a fair amount of evidence that the Earth's
<br>
atmosphere
<br>
is undergoing global warming, the process is slow enough that there are
<br>
plenty of skeptics, including some very influential people, who argue
<br>
that
<br>
it may not be happening at all.
<br>
Global climate change does occur, however, and sometimes so quickly that
<br>
you
<br>
can watch it happening. Just look at our neighbor, Mars: within the last
<br>
month, the global atmospheric temperature of Mars has increased by
<br>
approximately 50 degrees Fahrenheit, according to data being received by
<br>
the
<br>
Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on NASA's Mars Global Surveyor
<br>
spacecraft.
<br>
<p>The cause of this sudden shift is a giant dust storm that has snowballed
<br>
and
<br>
now has enveloped almost the entire planet, absorbing a lot of the Sun's
<br>
energy in the upper atmosphere.
<br>
<p>&quot;It started out as a large dust storm in the southern latitudes in late
<br>
June,&quot; said Arizona State University's Korrick Professor of Geology
<br>
Philip
<br>
Christensen, the principal investigator for TES. &quot;The dust trapped
<br>
sunlight
<br>
and heated the atmosphere locally. As this warm air flowed to regions
<br>
where
<br>
the air was still cool it generated winds which raised more dust into
<br>
the
<br>
atmosphere.
<br>
<p>&quot;By the end of the first week in July, most of the planet was enveloped
<br>
and
<br>
our readings of atmospheric temperature had increased by about 30
<br>
degrees
<br>
Centigrade.&quot;
<br>
<p>TES is an instrument designed to take detailed readings of energy
<br>
emissions
<br>
in the infrared range (heat energy) to aid in studying Mars' geology and
<br>
atmosphere. A movie showing the instrument's readings over the last
<br>
month,
<br>
tracking the expanding dust storm and the accompanying increase in
<br>
atmospheric temperature, is available on the web at:
<br>
<a href="http://tes.la.asu.edu">http://tes.la.asu.edu</a>.
<br>
Curiously, just as Earth's global warming may theoretically cause the
<br>
opposite thermal effect on some parts of the planet, so Mars' current
<br>
heat
<br>
wave is likely to bring on a big chill further on down the road.
<br>
<p>&quot;In the end, the cloaking of the entire planet with dust is probably
<br>
going
<br>
to cool down the surface of Mars significantly and ultimately shut this
<br>
entire weather system down again,&quot; said Christensen. &quot;It's kind of like
<br>
what
<br>
we imagine would happen with a nuclear winter on Earth.&quot; In fact,
<br>
Christensen points out, it was another global dust storm observed on
<br>
Mars in
<br>
the early 1970's that gave astronomer Carl Sagan and others the idea of
<br>
the
<br>
kind of catastrophic climate change that might be caused by a global
<br>
nuclear
<br>
war.
<br>
<p>&quot;Mars' atmosphere is a much simpler system than Earth's,&quot; Christensen
<br>
cautions, &quot;since it is much thinner and lacks most of the water that we
<br>
have
<br>
in ours, trapping energy and moderating changes. &quot;Still, it provides us
<br>
with
<br>
an interesting model for how global climate changes can occur, albeit
<br>
much
<br>
more quickly than on our planet. Nonetheless, some large scale changes
<br>
here
<br>
could be abrupt as well.&quot;
