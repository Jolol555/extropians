<p>I often wonder how much of USA's &quot;knowledge wealth&quot; is due to accepting 
<br>
immigrants. Early on, USA accepted people from all over the world, so it 
<br>
became a melting pot of ideas. Later this grew again during the second 
<br>
world war when Hitler and Mussolini scared a lot of the wealthy and 
<br>
brightest people away from Europe. At its height the British Empire was a 
<br>
center for bright minds from all over the planet. Earlier than that The 
<br>
Roman Empire joined people together. The Persian empire did the same thing 
<br>
and was a fertile place for minds to grow.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that the place is almost irrelevant, as is the political 
<br>
structure. What seems most important is that people can gather and share 
<br>
ideas. Maybe with the internet now we will see this become a planet-wide 
<br>
phenomenon.
<br>
<p>As to monetary wealth, I wonder how much is due to plundering the poorer 
<br>
nations of the planet, like my English ancestors did. You know, that old 
<br>
trick of installing a puppet government which bleeds off wealth to the 
<br>
foreign overlords and brutally suppresses any local revolts (think of 
<br>
Indonesia, for instance).
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
