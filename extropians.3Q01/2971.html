<em>&gt; I'm not sure you have a complete grasp of the Sysop Scenario. It is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about &quot;forcing&quot; anything at all. No one is forced to modify their mind,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or live a libertarian life. The whole point is everyone is free to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what they want, live the way they want, etc. It is volition-based. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is about protecting what you want and how you want to live.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would not call it a libertarian or any other society. Some people may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form governments or societies inside of it, others may not participate at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all and focus on individual pursuits. Yet they all can still interact with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other without any possibility of stepping on each others toes (unless they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want their toes stepped on).
</em><br>
<p>I think you miss my point: how does the Sysop Scenario prevent a group of
<br>
people/entities using their &quot;freedom&quot; to dismantle the Sysop Scenario and
<br>
set up their own form of managing things in which people/entities have no
<br>
freedom at all?
<br>
<p>The only way that you can prevent this is through use of force and coercion
<br>
by the Sysop.
<br>
<p>(And my original point was that if you don't have the freedom to destroy the
<br>
society, then it's not a truly libertarian society, which is why a truly
<br>
libertarian society can't exist).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have yet to see a better solution to the issue. At some point the matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (as in atoms) must fall under someone's control, and personally I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relish the idea of having to constantly protect myself from everyone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who can't be trusted with nanotech and AI. All it takes is one Blight to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wipe us out. That kind of threat does not go away as humans progress to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanity, rather it increases in likelihood. What is the stable state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if not Sysop or total death? There may be some other possibilities, can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you name some?
</em><br>
<p>The most likely outcome is just as it is now -- you will be constantly
<br>
having to protect yourself from entities that can't be trusted. Just that
<br>
the tech involved will be somewhat more sophisticated. It's dynamism in
<br>
action -- things constantly changing. The Sysop Scenario sounds like wishful
<br>
socialist central-planning type thinking...although there's nothing to say
<br>
that central planning couldn't work if you have sufficient processing power.
<br>
But it's not a free society.
