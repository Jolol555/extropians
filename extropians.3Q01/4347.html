<em>&gt; For example a genetically engineered self-destruct mechansism that causes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a cell's DNA to be wiped as soon as it is detached from the body. How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feasible would this be?
</em><br>
<p>David Zindell's Neverness series has characters very worried about
<br>
the crime of having their DNA stolen and clones made, which they call
<br>
&quot;slelling&quot;.  It wasn't clear to me what the big deal was though.
<br>
<p>Maybe a far-sighted crimintal should go around now and yank some hair
<br>
out of passing celebrities (DNA in the hair roots) and freeze it for
<br>
later use.
<br>
<p>As for technological counter-measures, shutting down the DNA would
<br>
presumably kill the cell, so you wouldn't want to make it too sensitive.
<br>
In most systems false alarms are far more common than real ones, and it
<br>
would be embarrassing to die because of a glitch in whatever mechanism
<br>
told your cells they were still part of your body.
<br>
<p>Therefore any self destruct will probably take some time to operate,
<br>
and it is possible that it could be frozen and/or disabled by the thief
<br>
before it manages to destroy the DNA.  It sounds like a difficult problem
<br>
to do well.
