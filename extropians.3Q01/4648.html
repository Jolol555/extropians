<p>You see no evidence of such fraud in this latest editorial?
<br>
<p>Well, did you see any evidence of fraud *in the text* of the
<br>
posted article??   Sorry to post it again, but here it is.
<br>
Where is the evidence of fraud *here*??  Where are the signs
<br>
of a religious inclination even??  You're not being consistent!

<p>Claremont Institute Precepts: Planet of the Abes
<br>
By Glenn Ellmers
<br>
<p>It is no longer spoiling the surprise, I hope, to reveal
<br>
the ending of the new Planet of the Apes movie: As Mark
<br>
Wahlberg, the human astronaut, returns to modern-day earth
<br>
his craft lands in Washington D.C.-specifically, he crashes
<br>
right into the Lincoln Memorial.  He seems to be safe and
<br>
sound, back in the good old USA, until he discovers that
<br>
the nation's capital is now controlled by our simian
<br>
rivals, and Abraham Lincoln is an ape!
<br>
<p>Many conservatives, surely, would not think a Washington
<br>
D.C. populated by monkeys an altogether offensive
<br>
metaphor.  And some would even revel in the Great
<br>
Emancipator portrayed as a brutish, war-mongering sub
<br>
human.  Indeed this was a common caricature of Lincoln
<br>
during the Civil War.  Even today, Lincoln's reputation
<br>
among conservatives remains a source of unending
<br>
controversy- as our recent quarrel with Joe Sobran attests.
<br>
(For details, see, claremont.org, empoweramerica.org, and
<br>
lewrockwell.com.)
<br>
<p>Though Sobran does not compare Lincoln to a simian beast
<br>
(to be fair, he also has words of praise), his critique of
<br>
Lincoln is severe.  &quot;Lincoln launched a bloody war against
<br>
the South, violating the Constitution he'd sworn to
<br>
uphold.&quot; But quite apart from the various and sometimes
<br>
complicated historical arguments about secession and &quot;state
<br>
sovereignty,&quot; Sobran's anti-Lincolnism is wrong because it
<br>
completely misidentifies the origins of our current
<br>
occupying army: i.e., the legions of liberals who, like the
<br>
apes in the movie, exercise an unnatural dominion over
<br>
human society.  Today's liberals don't, of course, look
<br>
like apes. Indeed, they are the beautiful people of our
<br>
time. But in their attitudes toward human liberty, the
<br>
enviro-thug gorillas, chimpanzee professoriate, and
<br>
orangutan feminists do seem almost of another species from
<br>
the men who wrote the Constitution and Declaration of
<br>
Independence.
<br>
<p>So is Lincoln, as Sobran and others claim, the prime
<br>
primate; the originator of unlimited government, social
<br>
engineering, and anti-constitutionalism?  Or does modern
<br>
liberalism have an altogether different source?   If we
<br>
conservatives are to preserve our rights, our liberties,
<br>
and indeed our humanity we must know the nature and basis
<br>
of the thing we are up against.  This question, then, of
<br>
liberalism's origin, is of the utmost importance.
<br>
<p>In the movie, the apes did not become dominant by any
<br>
natural process.  They were created as the products of
<br>
scientific engineering by humans, who-at their peril and
<br>
ultimate destruction-challenged nature's order.  In one of
<br>
the highlights of the movie, Charlton Heston plays the
<br>
dying father of the ape leader.  In his last words he
<br>
reveals that &quot;in the time before time,&quot; humans had been the
<br>
natural superiors and apes the inferiors.  This is the
<br>
great secret of the ape society.  Maintaining this secret
<br>
is one of the keys to the apes' control over humans.  No
<br>
less today do our apes-liberals-maintain a secret about
<br>
their own origins and purposes.  Only by exposing it can we
<br>
hope to understand and overcome the greatest obstacle to
<br>
reclaiming our country.
<br>
<p>Sobran says his criticisms of Lincoln are meant to set the
<br>
historical record straight.  In fact, his claim that big
<br>
government and social engineering began in the 1860s
<br>
preserves the liberals' self-justifying myth.  Whatever
<br>
else he may present in his indictment, Sobran cannot
<br>
attribute to Lincoln the idea that the Constitution was
<br>
merely an 18th century document, and therefore out of date;
<br>
that natural rights were a &quot;fantasy;&quot; that modern life
<br>
because always changing-required a government that was
<br>
always growing; and that &quot;progress&quot; meant there was nothing
<br>
permanently true or right.  But these were precisely the
<br>
opinions voiced by the leading American philosophers,
<br>
journalists, and politicians in the Progressive Movement.
<br>
It was John Dewey, Herbert Croly, and Woodrow Wilson-not
<br>
Abraham Lincoln-who gave us the principles and practice of
<br>
the modern leviathan state.
<br>
<p>Within a generation, however, liberals realized that such
<br>
radical and honest talk revealed too much.  They needed to
<br>
disguise their purposes in more patriotic language. One of
<br>
the first to recognize this was Franklin Roosevelt, who
<br>
spoke of modernizing the Constitution instead of rejecting
<br>
it.  And rather than repudiating the natural rights of the
<br>
Declaration, liberals would come to speak of &quot;adding&quot;
<br>
rights-rights found not in our natural equality as human
<br>
beings, but created in and dispensed from Washington.  Now
<br>
here is the secret: despite the softening of the rhetoric,
<br>
the liberal project remained the same.  Americans would no
<br>
longer be citizens exercising sovereign control over their
<br>
government, but a mass of raw materials to be worked upon
<br>
by the government.
<br>
<p>This project finds no foundation in Abraham Lincoln, and
<br>
Mr. Sobran does conservatives no favor by confusedly
<br>
placing it there.  Space does not permit a complete
<br>
rehearsing of the arguments, but I refer you to Charles
<br>
Kesler's brief and excellent article, &quot;Getting Right with
<br>
Lincoln&quot; at
<br>
<a href="http://www.claremont.org/publications/kesler010121.cfm">http://www.claremont.org/publications/kesler010121.cfm</a>
<br>
<p>Professor Kesler shows that in his dedication to the
<br>
principles of the Declaration of Independence and
<br>
Constitution Lincoln is a valuable ally to modern
<br>
conservatism.  Let us be sensible enough to enlist such
<br>
formidable help, and clear-eyed enough to see the true
<br>
adversary.  The apes are gaining.
