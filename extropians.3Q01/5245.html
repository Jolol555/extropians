<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, I don't like diversity at all (except economic diversity).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It leads to group consciousness and divisiveness.  Many people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thus just simply can't help but think of themselves as &quot;this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jew&quot;, or &quot;this black woman&quot;, or &quot;this gay person&quot;, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This has not been my experience at all.  I find most people strongly
</em><br>
dislike
<br>
<em>&gt; being pigeon-holed into a classification.  Jews don't like being treated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different because they're Jews.  Blacks don't like being treated different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they're blacks.  Women don't like being treated different because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're women.  Gays don't like being treated different because they're
</em><br>
gay.
<br>
<em>&gt; That's the whole point behind equal rights, to treat different groups the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same.  Religion, race, gender and orientation shouldn't matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe diversity will help people become more comfortable with
</em><br>
different
<br>
<em>&gt; cultures.  It should lessen the problem rather than increase it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Besides, I don't know how you can dislike diversity.  People are diverse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you wish they weren't?  Do you wish all those groups you mentioned
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; be more like straight white males?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe divisiveness and group consciousness is the historical norm.
</em><br>
More
<br>
<em>&gt; diversity and mixing of cultures will help people to stop classifying
</em><br>
people
<br>
<em>&gt; by race or orientation as much.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since self-organization, freedom, individuality, competition, free-market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and sometimes evolution are considered to be primary Extropian principals,
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; find it hard to imagine an Extropian framework that does not seek to
</em><br>
promote
<br>
<em>&gt; diversity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, it doesn't apply to you, then, if you don't so strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; identify with being a woman, or a lesbian, or whatever, to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; point that it suppresses your own unique individuality.  I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; grant that most of those who do not appreciate diversity will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see you first as a whatever---but, sad to say, most of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who *do* appreciate diversity will also see you first as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whatever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A common misconception about &quot;them&quot; or any other group.  Let's assume you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are a straight white male.  Do you self-identify your racial purity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whiteness so much that it suppresses your own unique individuality?  Are
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; so male that you are the same stereotypical guy that every other male
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stereotype is?  Are you so identified as being straight, that you are not
</em><br>
an
<br>
<em>&gt; individual?  I think it would be rather silly if you were.  If your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; race, gender and orientation don't prevent you from being an individual,
</em><br>
why
<br>
<em>&gt; should you project this limitation onto other races, genders or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orientations?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And the more difficult question is:  to what degree do you feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more comfortable with others who are women and lesbians (not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; redundant, it turns out)?  Here is the horror:  you *do* have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more in common with them and so *must* have *some* comfort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; derived from that.  There is the fiendish &quot;reverberant doubt&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a notion derived from what Hofstadter wrote about some game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theory tableux:  when not with a woman or a lesbian, you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to wonder, &quot;does this person see me as different and perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cannot help but doing so and is perhaps asking him/herself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;does this person see me as different and perhaps cannot help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but doing so and is perhaps asking him/herself &quot;does this person...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe you are projecting your own thoughts onto others.  Do you find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself uncomfortable in the presence of women?  Do you prefer the
</em><br>
presence
<br>
<em>&gt; of men because you worry about how women view you?  Do you feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncomfortable among Jews or blacks?  Do you prefer to be among &quot;your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind&quot;?  If so, you should realize that not everybody feels this way.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not, why do you assume that everyone else must?  Part of the concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diversity is that everybody is different.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, that seems correct to me.  Wish us all luck, because we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are going to need it, pace Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sounds ominous.  Do you think diversity is going to cause something
</em><br>
bad
<br>
<em>&gt; to happen?  Why do we need to wish us all luck?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
All good comments, Harvey ... and at the very end -- GOOD QUESTION.
<br>
<p>Yes, please enlighten us, Lee.
