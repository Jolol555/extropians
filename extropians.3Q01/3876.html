<p><em>&gt;I have always thought that the definition at www.transhumanism.com is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;offical&quot; and it says, as Natasha previously mentioned, that &quot;trans&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in transhuman comes from &quot;in transition&quot; - phase between being human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and transhuman. As I understand this, any modifiement - now matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how small - that works better than normal allows you to use the title.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This would then exclude contact lenses as they seldom improve one's vision
</em><br>
beoynd normal.
<br>
<p>Actually, the transition is from being human to becoming posthuman, not
<br>
from human to transhuman.  You are correct about the contact lens as not
<br>
being a transhuman augmentation in that it does not improve a human beyond
<br>
what is &quot;normal.&quot; 
<br>
<p>(From my earlier post: &quot;Transhuman would more fully reflect both the
<br>
physical and the mental.  The brain is part of the body.  The senses
<br>
interact with the brain by sending messages.  By enhancing the senses, we
<br>
are enhancing the brain.  The cognition (reasoning) you are thinking about
<br>
seems to be a purely intellectual process, which is certainly important in
<br>
defining humans, but we are not just intellectual beings.  However, if we
<br>
had a genetic treatment that allowed us to be physically ageless but we
<br>
were no smarter or more intellectual than before, we would undeniably be
<br>
transhuman because agelessness is outside the limits of our genes,
<br>
regardless of an average IQ.  Further, part of intelligence is social
<br>
intelligence in dealing with people effectively. Example:  If we could
<br>
enhance the ability of  person A to see person B's blood flow and then to
<br>
watch it heating up through an augmented visual extro-vision which  would
<br>
give a person A more advantage - new sensory ability, this sensory ability
<br>
would  be considered beyond human. It is not a cognitive thing, but a
<br>
sensory thing.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Thus, &quot;a person who has a genetic malfunction and is given a synthetic
<br>
enzyme would be  at early transhuman stage.  A person who is born a man and
<br>
has not only a sex change but also hormone therapy could also be considered
<br>
a transhuman if he/she so desired. The issue would probably be the
<br>
alteration of what it is to be human or, on an individual basis, what it is
<br>
to be that person (with his or her genetic makeup) which has been altered.&quot;)
<br>
<p>Regarding the FAQ at <a href="http://www.transhuman.org">http://www.transhuman.org</a>, it is quite good and has
<br>
some excellent information.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But IF previous definitions aren't offical and usage of these terms isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clear, this discussion is very important. '
</em><br>
<p>The definitions are accurate, but as we noted earlier on this thread, words
<br>
do change and we need to keep up with the times.  Totally changing a
<br>
definition from the ordinal meaning and usage of the word would be
<br>
disconcerting and a mistake.  However, regarding definitions for
<br>
transhuman, I think that WTA's FAQ came from my web site
<br>
<a href="http://www.transhuman.org">http://www.transhuman.org</a>  which was co-sponsored by FM', or from my book,
<br>
I can't remember. I know Ander's did. Extropy's definition states &quot;Someone
<br>
actively preparing for becoming posthuman. Someone who is informed enough
<br>
to see radical future possibilities and plans ahead for them, and who takes
<br>
every current option for self-enhancement.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It is about the name of the philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;after all. I agree with Elizier that word transhuman has strong emotional
</em><br>
effect so
<br>
<em>&gt;overusage should be avoided but I think that distinction between a
</em><br>
transhuman and
<br>
<em>&gt;posthuman should also be clear. If the terms were understood as I mentioned,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think both requirements would be filled - for now, that is.
</em><br>
<p>I'm confused with Eli's current issues.  Perhaps I am so accustomed to the
<br>
word transhuman that it is ingrained in my mind.  Also, when I explain it
<br>
to people I do so in a way that is as unthreatening as possible.  I even
<br>
gave a lecture on transhumans at an elementary school.  The kids really
<br>
liked the idea.
<br>
<p>What I do think could and often does cause a strong emotional affect is
<br>
using Uploads, superintelligences,  and even Singularity.  But, Singularity
<br>
will become more acceptable if we don't scare the pants off of people when
<br>
we discuss it.  I think Ray Kurzweil does a splendid job of this.  Hans
<br>
Moravec scars the pants off me when I talk with him about becoming a bush -:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But then, why couldn't this definition then also include memes? If
</em><br>
transhumanist
<br>
<em>&gt;attitude attitude somehow helps - and if improvements were available today,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it certainly would help to take advantage of them - this attitude would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;also be an improvement - a self-acquired one - making you transhuman. And
</em><br>
also,
<br>
<em>&gt;judging from the difficulities most people have dealing with techno-optimism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the word &quot;beoynd human&quot; would also apply as well. :)
</em><br>
<p>I do think the transhumanist attitude is very helpful in developing an
<br>
understanding about change and acclimate to change. 
<br>
<p>Thanks for your input,
<br>
<p>Best,
