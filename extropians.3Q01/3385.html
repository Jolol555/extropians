<em>&gt; Why do you believe what you do? Why do I? We'd all like to believe that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have arrived at the conclusions most tenable after dispassionate logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analyses.
</em><br>
<p>I have had a few pyschology courses that pretty much stated that 90% of what
<br>
we believe is already in place by the time we are about 5 or 6.  One of the
<br>
ideas of &quot;reparenting&quot; is that we have to go back and re-think this because
<br>
we are relying on conclusions made by a child.  Even if that child is
<br>
ourselves, they are likely to be incorrect.
<br>
<p>I agree with this view.  That's why people often have a violent break-up
<br>
when they diverge from their family or their church.  The ties are really
<br>
more emotional than logical.  Finally when logic overcomes our assumptions
<br>
and forces us to face that we do NOT believe the way we have been acting, it
<br>
is a very emotional experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The recent presidential election snafu also gave me pause in considering
</em><br>
why
<br>
<em>&gt; we believe what we do. I don't see any particular consonance between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative or Republican thought and not wanting recounts, on the one
</em><br>
hand,
<br>
<em>&gt; and liberal or Democratic thought and wanting recounts, on the other. Yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's my impression that a large majority of people who had opinions as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether recounts should be undertaken had the opinion that was most likely
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; aid their favored candidate's election.
</em><br>
<p>I have seen this a LOT.  Many people simply cannot separate hypothetical
<br>
from what is happening now.  In those recounts, the majority of people
<br>
wanted rules that helped their candidate.  Most of those claimed that the
<br>
rules were &quot;logical&quot; and that they would want the same rules even if the
<br>
candidates roles were reversed.  I don't think so.  I think they started
<br>
with the knowledge of who they wanted to win, and whether concious or not
<br>
liked or disliked rules based not on logic, but whether it would help their
<br>
side.
