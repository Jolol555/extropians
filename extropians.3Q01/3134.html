<p><em>&gt; Or perhaps logic and reason is not the end and be all of ways to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fruitfully understand and make wise choices.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, absolutely.  I made a glancing reference to emotions, but as
<br>
you may know emotions evidently play a key role in our *reasoning*
<br>
processes.  I intend to post more about that soon.  (I have a lot
<br>
of good intentions.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; When I am comfortable saying that, I can then proceed to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; more difficult abridgment, &quot;The Fred Reed piece was racist.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Now after I say it a few times, it gets a lot easier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; In just this way, we can employ our rationality to help ourselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; move forward.  In this way, we can allow, as you put it, reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; into our lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you really think this is an example of anything highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admirable, especially of an example of the benefits of reason? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How so?  I don't get it.  Honest examination leads to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion for sure but was it really at all difficult to do?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Because (a) the process of political polarization that
<br>
I explained in several previous posts (b) the implied criticism
<br>
of beliefs of some people on this list who were being beleaguered
<br>
from all quarters, and I was &quot;piling on&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think in terms of &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot;.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am one who has embraced many intellectually, emotionally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychologically and spiritually painful positions in my life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I believed that honesty and being fully alive required it. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How could I do anything else when I know what dishonesty brings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from trying that all together too many times?  
</em><br>
<p>It is very easy for most people to avoid embracing many 
<br>
painful positions of the kinds you describe.  You are
<br>
indeed very fortunate that you couldn't bring yourself
<br>
to do anything else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't have &quot;ideological opponents&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>That's very unusual for one who has thought a good
<br>
deal about politics, at least here in the U.S.
<br>
