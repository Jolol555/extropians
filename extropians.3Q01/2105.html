<p><em>&gt; The various proposals for bringing a more critical eye to factual

<p>Two things are required for people to appreciate such tools:  one
<br>
is temperament.  Anyone with a political axe to grind, or who feels
<br>
so passionately about issues that he or she is not often objective,
<br>
will have little use for tools that can also be used by &quot;the enemy&quot;.
<br>
<p>Second is simply having adequate intelligence.  By this I don't mean
<br>
that if they were properly motivated, ordinary people would find such
<br>
tools beyond them; I'm merely saying with the usual motivation we
<br>
humans possess, many of us lack the necessary intelligence.  For example,
<br>
if I were much smarter, then the &quot;overhead&quot; of finding out all about 
<br>
these tools would be less.  This means: if all our I.Q.s tomorrow
<br>
were doubled (say by some genetic engineering), these tools would be
<br>
used by more people.
<br>

<br>
<p>Because of its usual objectivity and clarity, I indulge by quoting
<br>
the remainder of Hal's post:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ct forwards,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Global climate change does occur, however, and sometimes so quickly that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you can watch it happening. Just look at our neighbor, Mars: within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; last month, the global atmospheric temperature of Mars has increased by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; approximately 50 degrees Fahrenheit, according to data being received by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on NASA's Mars Global Surveyor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; spacecraft.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's funny how our observations and interpretations are guided by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the current political landscape.  In the 1970s there was talk of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impending ice age, and the 1980s brought the nuclear winter scare, so the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emphasis on the Mars dust storms was the resulting *fall* in temperature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today the worry is global warming, so we read about the sudden *rise*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in temperature on Mars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine the headline 20 years ago being Mars Dust Storms Raise Temperature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 50 Degrees.  That would have been no more possible than to see one today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about a sudden drop in temperature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hope that someday we will have improved our communications technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the point that news can be disseminated with much less concern about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political implications.  Of course the net is a great step forward.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20 years ago there would have been no way for us to express our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerns about these issues, except perhaps through letters to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; editor.  Distributed virtual communities allow for sharing of news and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information outside the control of the great political and economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powers.  Talk radio and magazines offer other avenues.  But we still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't have an integrated system where these two worlds can coexist:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the official, respectable, politically correct one, and the anarchic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diverse, uncomfortable and unflinching world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The various proposals for bringing a more critical eye to factual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reporting have never come to fruition.  Xanadu, Crit mediator and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; web-commentary systems, back links, Drexler's fact forums, all have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remained nothing but toys.  Maybe the world's just not ready for them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But Slashdot has been reasonably successful despite the often abysmal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quality of their moderation system (which attempts to select and highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher-quality commentary).  Perhaps it will eventually grow to add some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parallel mechanisms to help to integrate parallel viewpoints into a story.
</em><br>
