<p>I would only have needed enough to pay my rent,

which was 50 dollars a month in 1983, and another

200 would feed me.  I dont eat much.  But there was

no 250 a month back then.

<p><em>&gt; I would have never abandoned playing chess, reading SF,

<p>Leeeeee!  You play?  Cool, we should do some email
<br>
chess.  Cool, where were you at E5?  Have an rating?
<br>
I meant in chess, not in carousing.  {8^D

<p><em>&gt; So I would suggest that *at the present time* a substantial

</em><br>
<p>Heres how we work this: set up a pool that anyone can
<br>
contribute whatever amount they want.  Then at the end of
<br>
the month we distribute it evenly among all who want a share
<br>
of this guaranteed income.  Note the guarantee only applies
<br>
to the share, not the actual amount.  How much do you
<br>
suppose that amount would be?  spike
