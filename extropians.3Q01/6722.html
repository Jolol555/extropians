<p>
Excellent analysis from Charlie Stross.
<br>
<p>I would like to comment that much of the disagreement about &quot;terrorism&quot; seen
<br>
on the list recently is due to people using the same word to mean different
<br>
things and then discussing at cross purposes. When discussing, remember,
<br>
First - define your terms.
<br>
<p>The Oklahoma bomber, the Unibomber, the Northern Ireland IRA, the Basque
<br>
terrorists, etc. are what I would call &quot;domestic terrorism&quot;. They have a
<br>
grievance against their own government/country and take illegal actions to
<br>
try to obtain some kind of compromise/change of policy. In this type of
<br>
terrorism the government in their own country is already engaged in opposing
<br>
them and trying to stop/reduce their illegal activities. As some people have
<br>
commented, this type of terrorism is difficult to eliminate totally, as the
<br>
terrorists are part of the community and melt away to become invisible.
<br>
<p>However, this is not the type of terrorism that happened in New York and in
<br>
our discussions we just add confusion if we bring in the problems of dealing
<br>
with internal terrorism.
<br>
<p>The 9-11 terrorist attacks were &quot;state-supported&quot; terrorism. This is where
<br>
one country uses terrorists to attack another country without declaring war.
<br>
&quot;State-supported terrorism&quot; is what the USA and NATO are now setting out to
<br>
remove from our world. It might be a long job. But if examples are made of
<br>
one or two countries then other rogue governments might well decide that
<br>
&quot;state-supported terrorism&quot; is a suicidal policy and cease following that
<br>
path. (Pakistan is already showing a remarkable turnaround in their public
<br>
statements). One by one, rogue governments should be given the choice - Do
<br>
you want to support international terrorists or do you want the USA and NATO
<br>
to destroy your government?
<br>
<p>Note that I do not expect that the USA or NATO will &quot;bomb the countries to
<br>
dust&quot; as someone put it. There is no need. The rogue government and any
<br>
known terrorist bases will be destroyed and possibly some of their military
<br>
resources as well. Then, when the next government/leader arises they should
<br>
be offered the same choice, along with offers of development aid to rebuild
<br>
if they renounce the support of international terrorism. Ongoing supervision
<br>
by technical experts who are also assisting the country rebuild would of
<br>
course be necessary to ensure that they really had disowned international
<br>
terrorism. The USA and NATO have no interest in the religion or social
<br>
systems of the Middle East countries and have no desire to &quot;take-over&quot; these
<br>
countries. But they are now prepared to say that they will not allow
<br>
governments to support international terrorism.
<br>
<p>The Israel/Palestine situation seems to me to be more like domestic
<br>
terrorism and therefore irrelevant to discussions about how to stop
<br>
international terrorism.
<br>
<p>The immediate response depends on finding out who was to blame for the
<br>
9-11attacks. It is up to the FBI to gather evidence. As we are now
<br>
approaching military action, any public information is likely to be
<br>
disinformation to avoid giving warning to possible targets. The Taliban and
<br>
Bin Laden have frequently been mentioned and by their own statements and
<br>
previous actions probably deserve to be attacked. The Taliban has indeed
<br>
provided bases for the Bin Laden terrorist group.  As several people have
<br>
commented, removing the tyrannical Taliban government will help the Afghan
<br>
people far more than it will help the USA.
<br>
<p>Bin Laden has now denied any involvement in the 9-11 attacks (although
<br>
he has been connected to previous terrorist actions). Actually, I am
<br>
inclined to give him the benefit of some doubt in this case. At least to the
<br>
extent that he did it on his own. He may have provided some men or materials
<br>
to assist another organisation but I doubt if his group has the resources to
<br>
carry out this attack. Remember we are looking at a five year plan involving
<br>
50 or more people who infiltrated the USA. This is more like a military
<br>
special ops attack from a foreign country.
<br>
IMHO I believe the real culprit could well lie elsewhere.
<br>
<p>We shall soon know, and I hope they receive just retribution.
<br>
<p><p>Regards, BillK
