<p>PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS WILL PROMPT TOUGH CHOICES
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from THE LIGHTHOUSE &quot;Enlightening Ideas for Public Policy...&quot; Vol. 3,
<br>
Issue 27 July 9, 2001
<br>
<p>Although a proposed Patients' Bill of Rights is intended to protect patients
<br>
from abuses of the health care bureaucracy, it is likely to raise health
<br>
care costs and prompt health care bureaucrats to make tough choices that may
<br>
be diametrically opposed to patients' interests.
<br>
<p>According to economist Roger Feldman, editor of AMERICAN HEALTH CARE
<br>
(Independent Institute, 2000), the Patients' Bill of Rights will likely make
<br>
health-insurance premiums increase. Add to that the outlays (as high as 30
<br>
percent) that many HMOs spent on new equipment, drugs and facilities, and it
<br>
becomes clear that health care costs won't be falling anytime soon.
<br>
<p>With medical costs continuing to rise, and market-based approaches to
<br>
cost-containment being abandoned in favor of regulatory approaches, public
<br>
policy will increasingly revolve around such delicate questions as: Who
<br>
should decide where health care resources are allocated? How will spending
<br>
decisions change when the current Medicare surplus is eaten up by Medicare
<br>
spending?
<br>
<p>During the presidental campaign, Feldman writes, both parites &quot;sidestepped
<br>
the interplay of public and private responsibilities in health care. Now
<br>
that the campaign is over, for the sake of those who rely on health care
<br>
services, the [Bush] administration and the public must be ready to face the
<br>
tough questions.&quot;
