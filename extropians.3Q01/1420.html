<em>&gt;The point of a defensive system in a military theater is as you describe.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The point of a population defense system against WoMD has to be to stop all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or probably all incoming missiles.  If you stop 90% of 20 missiles, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;threat has not been countered.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;That doesn't have to be the point of a population defense system. Stopping
<br>
a single accidentally launched missile doesn't sound like a frivolous goal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A system in development that stops 20% in five years and 40% in 10 years 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and 60% in 15 years doesn't deter attacks on population.  It may serve to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deter attacks on hardened military targets promising retaliation.  If we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;build hardened military targets promising retaliation, any enemies we have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will notice that those tools can be used for offense as well as defense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'd like to hear how developing a system like this promotes stability in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the period in which it's an imperfect shield.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I suspect it promotes stability by reducing the chance that a conventional
<br>
war would escalate into a nuclear war. I claim that the biggest danger of
<br>
a major nuclear war comes from the losing side of a conventional war trying
<br>
to scare the winning side into a truce by launching a single nuclear missile
<br>
and gambling that the winning side will be too cautious to retaliate with
<br>
a nuke. With an SDI that will probably stop the first few missiles, a
<br>
nuclear strike that would be designed to be as threatening as a single
<br>
missile is now would produce less certain results and would end up looking
<br>
a lot more like an all-out attack, so would be more likely to be detered
<br>
by MAD logic.
<br>
&nbsp;For stopping an all-out attack by a country like Russia, I don't forsee
<br>
SDI ever making a serious claim to replace MAD.
