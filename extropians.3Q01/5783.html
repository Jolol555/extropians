<em>&gt;From: &quot;J. R. Molloy&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jr@shasta.com?Subject=Re:%20Hawking%20on%20AI%20dominance&In-Reply-To=&lt;F201G6onZJ1X6ewxqea000074a9@hotmail.com&gt;">jr@shasta.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;How sad...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another great brain succumbs to the myth of the monstrous machine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The fact that genetic engineering can't possibly keep up with the evolution 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machine intelligence apparently escaped Hawking's notice. He also ignored 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;electronic systems can become biological ones, completely independent of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organic chemistry. The flaw in Hawking's advocacy of human intelligence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;artificial brains is screamingly obvious in that Hawking's human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;itself failed to recognize and acknowledge the faster timeline of AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(compared
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to improving humans by increasing the complexity of DNA).
</em><br>
<p>I think it's safe to say Hawking is no dummy.  I'd think twice before 
<br>
dismissing his ideas on any scientific subject.  But, my personal admiration 
<br>
aside, from the short blurb on the site it does not appear that he wants to 
<br>
augment human learning in the hope of keeping up with the pace AI learning.  
<br>
Rather, it seems to me, that what he is proposing is some sort of symbiosis 
<br>
between the biological and artificial intelligences.
<br>
<p>Silicon, for all its good properties, does have some drawbacks.  When a 
<br>
computer crashes, all is lost unless there has been a recent save to 
<br>
&quot;non-volitile&quot; memory.  Our memories are a seemless integration between RAM 
<br>
and ROM.  Not to mention the built-in multiple redundant redundancies which 
<br>
let you keep going even after something so disruptive as a stroke.  Although 
<br>
these advantages will increasingly be replicated in computers and, at some 
<br>
point, I imagine that the only thing the bio-brain would add to the 
<br>
synth-brain would be slowness.  At that point we pathetic meat-puppets had 
<br>
better cross over and abandon the bio-brain, or get seriously left behind.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
