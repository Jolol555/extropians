Miriam, centralization is driven by economics. For a great many things,
<br>
<p>The economic benefits of centralization outweigh the economic costs.
<br>
When the economic environment changes, this cost ratio changes. 911
<br>
was an extreme example of a change in the (perceived) costs of
<br>
centralization. Manhattan is an example of physical centralization.
<br>
Trains and huge airports are much more centralized than the road system.
<br>
Huge power plants are much more centralized than small plants or
<br>
local generation. Networks with high-speed backbones are more
<br>
centralized than grids. City water is more centralized than wells.
<br>
<p>In essence, you cannot make a universal qualitative argument in
<br>
favor of decentralized systems: you need to look at the economics,
<br>
and that means using your calculator or speadsheet.
<br>
<p>If you wish to pay for redundancy, you first decide how much you
<br>
you want. Basically, you can get redundancy by dividing your
<br>
resource into N pieces and then adding an extra piece (N+1 redundancy.)
<br>
in general, the cost of your solution is the cost of the extra piece
<br>
plus the cost of the additional interconnection and control plus (or 
<br>
minus) the &quot;efficiency ratio&quot; associated with building more smaller
<br>
units rather than fewer big ones.
<br>
<p>For office buildings, the equations still work, but tragically we
<br>
cannot actually have backups for the workers, since each worker
<br>
is a unique human. Even in the economic sense, workers are not
<br>
interchangeable. However, we can still cut our failure risks using
<br>
the above redundancy model since surviving workers from other offices
<br>
can and do fill in as best they can.
<br>
<p>I am a Systems Architect, and I've been one for more than 15 years.
<br>
My field is data communications switching, so I usually worry about
<br>
the number of processing elements in a switch or the redundancy of
<br>
a network topology. It is traumatic to apply my discipline to
<br>
911, but the analysis nevertheless stands.
