<em>&gt; Eliezer's gloss on sexual selection is much too negative.  It implies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it's usually subject to hijacking, rather than usually based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that is not a &quot;cheap signal&quot;.
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<em>&gt; I think all the examples referred to in the gloss (antlers, peacock's tail,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence) have been justified reasonably well as expensive signals that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are good fitness markers.  If they were not so, it's likely that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process Eli described would have been able to hijack the signals, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end up driving the species extinct.  Doesn't the fact that these species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue to survive give us some reason to believe that sexual selection, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguably stupid, isn't destructive in the observed cases?
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made you decide to present this topic in such a negative light?
</em><br>
<p>What a strange notion.  First off, I have no particular emotion about
<br>
sexual selection, in case you were wondering.  I care about the structure
<br>
of evolutionary forces because evolution is the source of human cognition,
<br>
plus a case of wry humor for the possibility that human intelligence
<br>
happened not because it was so useful and powerful but because a bunch of
<br>
apes wound up with the self-propagating delusion that intelligence was
<br>
sexy.
<br>
<p>The reason why the possible dysgenic nature of sexual selection is
<br>
emphasized is because it's so important for evolutionary theorists to
<br>
realize that evolution does not always operate to produce greater
<br>
fitness.  As an exception to the surface rule, pondering it helps us to
<br>
understand the real, deeper rules that truly underly evolution.
<br>
<p>It doesn't matter whether sexual selection focuses on signals that are
<br>
cheap or expensive.  The point is that sexual selection will give more
<br>
weighting to those signals than their environmental fitness would warrant
<br>
because of the extra weighting for reproductive fitness.  If you view
<br>
evolution as a flawed version of a normative goal system with
<br>
environmental fitness at the top, then &quot;sexual selection&quot; is a systemic
<br>
flaw that tends to greatly increase the strength of certain subgoals for
<br>
no particular reason.  To the extent that there is only so much selection
<br>
pressure to go around, then sexual selection is usually dysgenic - unless,
<br>
by pure unplanned coincidence, sexual selection drives a species out of a
<br>
local minimum and into previously unexplored but fruitful areas of the
<br>
fitness gradient.  This is probably what happened with humanity and
<br>
intelligence.
