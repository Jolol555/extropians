<em>&gt;  That doesn't have to be the point of a population defense system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stopping a single accidentally launched missile doesn't sound like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frivolous goal. 
</em><br>
<p>While not frivolous, it doesn't remove the threat.  If someone tries for 
<br>
nuclear blackmail, (or wants to take vengence on civilians) being able to 
<br>
stop 90% of their missiles won't stop them if they have a few.  And while 
<br>
it would reduce the casualties, it wouldn't reduce the value of the threat, 
<br>
or significantly reduce the quality of the revenge.
<br>
<p>As you reinforce, the value does depend on what the goals of the defender 
<br>
are.  I'll admit that Redell &amp; Nelson's points (on which I base most of my 
<br>
arguments) were rooted in cold war strategies, which assumed that the 
<br>
opponents were armed, dangerous, and willing to fire if the value of their 
<br>
arsenal was threatened.  In that situation, working toward population 
<br>
defense undercut the value of the the oponent's arsenal, moving him closer 
<br>
to firing preemptively.  The current level of relative peace does change 
<br>
the strategies.
<br>
<p>That said, there are still many cases in which having a not-perfect 
<br>
defensive shield encourages attacks, and many in which it encourages 
<br>
potential attackers to invest in an arms race.  I haven't seen anything in 
<br>
this discussion to make me think we're much closer than 20 years to 
<br>
creating a near perfect interdiction system given the approaches SDI 
<br>
considers.  If we (the gov't) save the billions of dollars that SDI 
<br>
proposes to spend on deploying partially effective systems in the short 
<br>
term, we (the people) will have more money to spend developing technologies 
<br>
that may make this whole approach obsolete.
