<p>&lt;&lt; Quite possibly true, although it'd be much harder in some cosmologies than
<br>
&nbsp;in others -- there doesn't seem to be all that much literature on the
<br>
&nbsp;cosmological equivelant of landscaping and architecture. The big questions
<br>
&nbsp;would seem to be how to engineer energy differentials and what to do about
<br>
&nbsp;the decay of fundamental particles. Tipler goes into that in fair detail for
<br>
&nbsp;the big crunch model.

<p>Your remark brings to mind a concern of mine, a pet peev-why so many 
<br>
astronomers cosmologists and physicists seem to self censure themselves 
<br>
regarding speculation. They surely seem to do this, as if every conjecture 
<br>
requires a peer-review, as if every supposition, has to match up with 
<br>
collective thinking. If I had the money, I'd hire scientists to produce a 
<br>
work akin to what Moravec Tipler Linde and a few other have so far done.
