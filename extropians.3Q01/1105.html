<em>&gt; &gt; Samantha, I do think you're being too tolerant here.  Can you give me an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; example of a correct conclusion or useful strategy that can be arrived at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by being religious and cannot be arrived at in any other way?  Actually,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; let me ease that requirement; can you show me a strategy or knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which is easily *invented* by religion but is harder to arrive at through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rationality?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is life only about &quot;correct conclusions&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know.  But I don't think that incorrect conclusions have any part
<br>
to play in it.  And the human mind, as we are all fond of saying, is
<br>
complicated.  If a way of thought - whatever its other effects - leads me
<br>
to form incorrect conclusions, not just of a temporary and transient type,
<br>
but of a long-lasting and self-rationalizing type, then it isn't worth
<br>
it.  I'll stick with rationality in the here-and-now, and if there's some
<br>
irrational element that's really important, I'll get around to it after
<br>
the Singularity, when it isn't so dangerous.
<br>
<p>Actually, I *don't* believe that any ways of thought that lead to
<br>
incorrect conclusions will turn out to be ultimately important.  I think
<br>
that &quot;being in harmony with the Universe&quot;, a &quot;clear pool&quot;, an undistorting
<br>
mirror, i.e., correct conclusions, is the sigil of all things worthy of
<br>
care.
<br>
<p>But that's really almost irrelevant.  A human being is a seed, in the same
<br>
way that present-day civilization is a seed.  Most of my effort goes into
<br>
protecting the civilization, rather than myself, but I can't really know
<br>
what's worth defending unless I at least think about what I'd be defending
<br>
if I was defending myself.  And the answer, on an individual level, and on
<br>
a civilization level, is that what must be defended above all is
<br>
potential.
<br>
<p>So I tend to be really unfond of self-reinforcing incorrect beliefs that
<br>
will probably lead a great many people to refuse to take part in the
<br>
Singularity for utterly wrong reasons.  I'm very suspicious of your
<br>
assertion that there might be something to be valued in spirituality,
<br>
unless you can give me an example of something specific to be valued.  I
<br>
expect value only when I have reason to do so.  But people often &quot;want&quot; to
<br>
see value, in one of the many awful cases where human thinking distorts
<br>
the premises to make the conclusions less uncomfortable.  I see that as a
<br>
negative force in the Universe.  So I'm suspicious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a different way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking at my life,  what I am doing, what we are all doing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what can come of it integrates into something that strengthens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my ability to contribute maximally and may help others to do so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then that is in itself quite important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can a vision of the type of future you wish to create come only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from rationality or do you need to add quite a few different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elements and include a large dose of what you would most like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see, do what you can to weave it into a unity and then look for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tools and memes to encourage it to come into being?  Is this all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a rational process or are only rational tools such as science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and logic allowed in forming the vision and in encouraging it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into reality?
</em><br>
<p>I think perhaps you underestimate the powers of rationality.  Perhaps you
<br>
have, in your life, drawn on spirituality in places where I have learned
<br>
to draw on rationality.  I hope not.  As far as I'm concerned, I've
<br>
achieved what I've achieved because of my determination to always walk the
<br>
path of rationality, including in places where rationality is not commonly
<br>
used because it looks a little difficult.  And the reason is that I had
<br>
enough past experience to predict that even if the path of rationality
<br>
looked a little difficult, sticking to the problem and not giving up at
<br>
first glance would yield results eventually.  So far, this strategy has
<br>
always paid off really big.
<br>
<p>In particular, rationality has the power to judge which &quot;arational&quot;
<br>
elements of the mind are important, whether or not they're too dangerous
<br>
to be used, and where their place is in the larger scheme of things.  One
<br>
of the things I really object to is the idea that rationality is somehow
<br>
&quot;incomplete&quot;, that there's something outside rationality that has the
<br>
power to dictate whether I should be rational, rather than the other way
<br>
around.  I've simply never found anything like this.  I've never found
<br>
anything even close.
<br>
<p>What I have found, though, is that rationalizers and rationalizations of
<br>
all kind are very fond of making this claim, with respect to flawed ways
<br>
of thinking that my rational mind can easily understand, encompass,
<br>
visualize, and accurately predict.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Religions are great tools for weaving visions.  For good and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ill.  They are also quite good for cohering societies devoted at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different levels to common goals.  And I believe some of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems have quite a lot to say about letting go of your current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mental/emotional lockstep and redefining and reintegrating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself.  This is a very important skill for what most of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contemplate doing and becoming.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I use rationality for that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Even so, I wouldn't want to be religious because, to my mind, it's better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be rational and strive to improve that rationality than to do something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that has short-term benefits but is crippling in the long term.  But what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm asking for here is an example of even a short-term cognitive benefit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and by that I mean &quot;coming up with a right answer&quot;, and not alleged lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stress levels and so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isn't this a bit circular?  You say it is better to be rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and improve that rationality but exactly what is that to you and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what do you use to validate that conclusion as best?  What makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you believe that all spirituality/religion is crippling in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long term?  In point of fact it seems not to be so for many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spiritual/religious-ly inclined people.
</em><br>
<p>Do they still believe wrong things?  Are they ready to give up those wrong
<br>
beliefs if they are disproved?  Or are they more likely to doubt the
<br>
(correct) disproof and even begin to inveigh against the Bayesian
<br>
Probability Theorem itself?  It is this perniciously self-protective
<br>
quality that I refer to as &quot;crippling&quot; because it results in people
<br>
digging themselves deeper into their holes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is the 'right answer&quot; the only thing important?  I growing into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a saner, more caring, more generous person of less worth than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting some cognitive &quot;right answer&quot;?  Is living life with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inner calmness even in the midst of the most strenuous and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hectic activity so worthless that that without any extra &quot;right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer&quot; is of no worth?
</em><br>
<p>I use rationality for that, too.
<br>
<p>I have lived my life according to the principle that if you pursue the
<br>
right answers, other things come to you; if you pursue other things at the
<br>
expense of truth, then you will simply wind up building stronger and
<br>
stronger shackles for yourself, and you will achieve neither truth nor
<br>
those other goals that were so important to you.
<br>
<p>My answer, then, is that I don't know whether &quot;correctly modeling the
<br>
Universe&quot; is the ultimate meaning of life, but I very definitely know that
<br>
correctly modeling the Universe is important to protecting this
<br>
civilization as it heads into Singularity, and even without that, I would
<br>
still never step aside from the path of correctly modeling the Universe
<br>
even if it made me temporarily happy, because I would fear that by doing
<br>
so, I was destroying a part of my own potential.
<br>
<p>I think that the best thing I can do to protect the potential of others is
<br>
to encourage them to use self-criticizing systems like rationality, and
<br>
argue against any suggestion that some other system is somehow &quot;outside&quot;
<br>
rationality.  In practice, the sole use of that belief is always to
<br>
protect mental wrongnesses from healthy ways of thinking.  Of course
<br>
mental cancers want to avoid the slings and arrows that are sent their
<br>
way, so of course people who haven't learned to think painful thoughts are
<br>
very happy with the idea that their pet theories are magically immune to
<br>
the discomforts that are being provided by their own innate intuitions and
<br>
external sources such as scientists.  But I view discomforting intuitions
<br>
as part of a healthy mind, and discomforting scientists as part of a
<br>
healthy society.
<br>
<p>I'll say it again:  Painful thoughts are part of a healthy mind.  But it
<br>
is equally true that it is human nature to avoid painful thoughts.  And
<br>
the conclusion is that those who love sanity, and wish to engender sanity
<br>
in others, should argue against those ways of thinking whose sole motive
<br>
force is their power to deflect healthy painful thoughts.
