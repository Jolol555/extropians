<p>&quot;Evidence compels us to consider that consciousness may 
<br>
operate as a *nonlocal* field. The Global Consciousness Project 
<br>
(GCP) takes this possibility a step further, proposing that the fields 
<br>
generated by individual consciousness would interact and combine, 
<br>
and ultimately have global dimensions&quot;
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------
<br>
<p>[very random mini-thoughts]
<br>
<p>Pauli wrote (to Heisenberg), about the EPR experiment: 
<br>
&quot;Quite independently of Einstein, it appears to me that, 
<br>
in providing a systematic foundation for quantum mechanics, 
<br>
one should start more from the *composition and separation*
<br>
of systems than has until now (with Dirac, e.g.) been the case.
<br>
&nbsp;- This is indeed - as Einstein has correctly felt - a very fundamental 
<br>
point in quantum mechanics ......&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Following Jarrett, Shimony, Howard, Cushing, etc.) the original 
<br>
Einstein-Bell locality condition [for a composite system in a joint state the 
<br>
joint probability of outcomes for measurements of observables is equal to 
<br>
the product of the separate probabilities] seems equivalent to the conjunction 
<br>
of two *independent* conditions: a *locality* condition and a *separability* 
<br>
condition.
<br>
<p>*Locality* = Given two systems A and B, space-like separated, the state 
<br>
of A cannot be influenced by events (measurements) on B, and viceversa.
<br>
<p>*Separability* = Two systems, separated by some spatio-temporal interval, 
<br>
possess their own separate states, regardless of their previous history,
<br>
and  the joint state is completely determined by their own separate states.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Now Aspect (et al.) showed that the Einstein-Bell locality condition is violated. 
<br>
It means that either the *locality* condition is violated or the *separability* condition
<br>
is violated (or both). The violation of *locality* implies superluminal comunication.
<br>
Eberhard, Page, Ghirardi (et al.) showed that QM implies (just) the violation 
<br>
of the *separability* condition.
<br>
<p>Note that a perfect *deterministic* quantum theory, which is able to reproduce 
<br>
all QM predictions, does not violate *separability* alone but also - and especially -
<br>
the *locality* condition. Which means: superluminal signals.
