</em><br>
<p>It think that this is a moot point: government (and anyone else) has no way
<br>
of accurately assessing whether any action is actually doing anyone any good
<br>
or not. There isn't even a sensible way of measuring &quot;good.&quot; So there is a
<br>
complete disconnect between intent and effect. If anyone (including
<br>
government) benefits, it was completely accidental.
<br>
<p>Doing bad things seems to be much easier for a government (in the sense that
<br>
its easier to ensure that the target actually does have something bad happen
<br>
to it), but again you have the problem of disconnect between intent and
<br>
effects. Plus which everyone else will suffer eventually.
