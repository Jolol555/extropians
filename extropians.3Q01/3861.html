<p><em>&gt;I read a short article today about Leon Kass, Bush's choice to head  his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;bio-ethics&quot; panel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The explicitness and aware depth of his bio-ludditism is something I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not seen before in the mainstream.
</em><br>
<p>And I say:
<br>
<p>Since the cloning of Dolly in 1997, Leon R. Kass has been one of the most 
<br>
vocal and passionate proponents of a ban on human cloning. He has advocated 
<br>
this position in a book, written with James Q. Wilson (_The Ethics of Human 
<br>
Cloning_, AEI Press 1998), and in two articles published in _The New 
<br>
Republic_: “The Wisdom of Repugnance” (June 1997) and “Preventing a Brave 
<br>
New World” (May 2001).
<br>
<p>These various publications show a considerable overlap in Kass’s material. 
<br>
_The Ethics of Human Cloning_ is essentially a debate between Kass and 
<br>
Wilson, another socially conservative thinker, but one with a more relaxed 
<br>
attitude to the prospect of cloning, so long as its use is confined to 
<br>
married couples. This book includes an expanded version of the original 1997 
<br>
_New Republic_ article, while “Preventing a Brave New World” repeats 
<br>
thoughts and paragraphs, from both versions of the earlier article, and from 
<br>
other material in _The Ethics of Human Cloning_. However, the new article 
<br>
adds aditional arguments and sometimes inserts new material amongst the old 
<br>
in a manner that suggests an intention to shore up the original arguments as 
<br>
far as possible. Thus the new article appears to be an attempt to present 
<br>
the author’s strongest, most carefully considered case against human 
<br>
cloning, based on his thinking and experience over several years.
<br>
<p>Kass’s importance in the cloning debate and the nature of the latest article 
<br>
would be sufficient to justify a careful inspection of the arguments that it 
<br>
contains. More importantly, however, the article makes radical claims with 
<br>
implications that go far beyond a debate about human cloning or other 
<br>
controversial reproductive technologies. Kass's main focus is that human 
<br>
cloning should be banned as an initial action in what he foresees as “a long 
<br>
battle against eugenics and a post-human future.” He also describes this as 
<br>
“the occasion for deciding whether we shall be slaves of unregulated 
<br>
innovation, and ultimately its artifacts, or whether we shall remain free 
<br>
human beings who guide our powers toward the enhancement of human dignity.” 
<br>
He is perfectly explicit that a ban on human cloning should be enacted as a 
<br>
positive step by the legislature in controlling what social mores and 
<br>
practices will, or will not emerge, in the future. Related to this wish to 
<br>
steer our society forcibly away from a “Brave New World” scenario, he 
<br>
advocates a ban on human cloning as a means of establishing that the onus is 
<br>
on those who wish to introduce “this major departure—or any major major 
<br>
departure—in human procreation” to make out “a compelling case” for this to 
<br>
be allowed.
<br>
<p>In arguing this way, Kass assumes that we may freely repudiate the classical 
<br>
liberal position, in which the state should remain essentially neutral in 
<br>
moral disputes among its citizens, offering a framework in which diverse 
<br>
visions of the good can be pursued, but declining to lend its might to 
<br>
favour one vision over others. He evidently feels free to state expressly 
<br>
that we should ban human cloning in order to foreclose a version of the 
<br>
future that he finds morally repugnant but which he believes may eventuate 
<br>
without the denial of anyone's freedom, simply through the accumulation of 
<br>
individual decisions and the operation of market forces. Although he does 
<br>
not argue why the state has a role in preventing such outcomes, it is 
<br>
essential to his whole argument that it should act to do so, by legislative 
<br>
prohibitions if needed. Kass’s assumptions are fundamentally at odds with 
<br>
the classical liberal ideal.
<br>
<p>The most frightening aspect of Kass’s analysis is that it could be used as a 
<br>
rationale to ban any technology or practice that is widely considered 
<br>
immoral, or whose adoption by a component of the society might encourage a 
<br>
reshaping of mores in a manner that is at odds with those prevailing today. 
<br>
For example, it could have been argued in the early 1960s that the 
<br>
contraceptive pill should be banned because its availability would lead to 
<br>
the acceptance of more casual attitudes to sex than those of the time. If 
<br>
the pill had been banned on these grounds in the jursidictions of liberal 
<br>
states, such as the US and ustralia, this would have been an official 
<br>
attempt to suppress alternatives views of sexual morality. Kass is now 
<br>
asking us to do something similar, taking actions designed to suppress the 
<br>
views those who support what he refers to as a “Brave New World” or a 
<br>
“post-human future”.
<br>
<p>Later in his essay, he refers to “some scientists and biotechnologists, 
<br>
their entrepreneurial backers, and a cheering claque of sci-fi enthusiasts, 
<br>
futurologists, and libertarians” as being “delighted” by our society’s 
<br>
supposed movement to a Brave New World. He lists a number of “transforming 
<br>
powers” as “already here”, including the contraceptive pill, in vitro 
<br>
fertilization, Ritalin, Viagra, Prozac and “to leave this vale of tears, a 
<br>
little extra morphine accompanied by Muzak.” I am not sure whether this last 
<br>
reference is to palliative care or to active euthanasia, and my puzzlement 
<br>
stems from a difficulty in reading Kass’s writing: he uses highly emotive 
<br>
language, hurling about adjectives such “dehumanizing” and “disgusting”, and 
<br>
freely uses metaphors even when it is not clear what they stand for. 
<br>
However, it is clear that Kass believes we are already in the process of 
<br>
creating the kind of society that he considers highly undesirable. His 
<br>
concern is not limited to the possibility of a “post-human” future in the 
<br>
strong sense that we may be superseded by artificial intelligences operating 
<br>
in robot bodies or in virtual reality (Kass's views are far more extreme 
<br>
than those of Bill Joy). In Kass’s world-view, the dreaded post-human state 
<br>
of society is already, to an extent, with us.
<br>
<p>In short, *the President is being guided by an explicit and knowing enemy of 
<br>
transhumanism*.
<br>
<p>Sorry, but I have to say that I saw this coming. Then again, I'm an 
<br>
Australian. *I* didn't vote into power a guy who was likely to use Leon Kass 
<br>
as his bioethical guru (not that Gore would have been much better, I 
<br>
suppose, and not that the situation is so much better here).
<br>
<p>Anyway, we all have to understand that it's not just Kass. Kass's views are 
<br>
far more common than you think, and far more resonant with the community 
<br>
than transhumanism. The question is what to do about it. (Thanks for getting 
<br>
us focused on something important, zeb.)
