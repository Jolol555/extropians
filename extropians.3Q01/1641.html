<p>It is a real classic. Unfortunately, I regard it as a &quot;dark side&quot;
<br>
classic (fitting website for it).
<br>
<p>One have to remember that it was written long before Axelrod's studies
<br>
of iterated prisoners dilemmas and during the height of the technocratic
<br>
paradigm where the only way of ensuring safety and prosperity was
<br>
centralised control. 
<br>
<p>This morning I was going through _När Var Hur 1973_ (&quot;When What How&quot;), a
<br>
fairly comprehensive swedish yearbook. I found an article about
<br>
technology in the year 2000. It was quite amazing: it talked about
<br>
composite materials, how computers would be used in design and
<br>
manufacture, that television and computer would meld together into a
<br>
single media (with over 50 channels! :-) sent using fiber optics over
<br>
computer networks.  A small sections about how enzymes would
<br>
revolutionize everything was totally wrong, but if you replace the word
<br>
&quot;enzyme&quot; with &quot;nanomachine&quot; you would get a fairly good description of
<br>
early nanotechnology. It seemed to be a very good extrapolation of then
<br>
current trends into the present - but the author claimed that none of
<br>
these systems would be possible without a stringent technology
<br>
assessment system, regulating what was invented and how it was applied.
<br>
So the biggest mistake was not in extrapolating technology, but in
<br>
extrapolating *how technology is developed and applied*. 
<br>
<p>I think the author of this article and Hardin make the same mistake.
<br>
They see a problem, note that the methods of solving the problem at
<br>
present are not enough, and then deduce that the problem must be solved
<br>
using their favorite paradigm. But there are often many ways of solving
<br>
problems, many of which are entirely alien to the current paradigm. We
<br>
have moved beyond planned inventions and centrally regulated resources
<br>
in many ways - but many people are still looking more qat the past for
<br>
their policies. Hence it is important to read and understand Hardin so
<br>
that we can counter the naive interpretations of his ideas that are
<br>
still very prevalent.
