I'm not sure what Charles is asking for.
<br>
<p>(1) I assume there is a power in the US constitution that enables federal 
<br>
research funding, probably with delegation to the executive branch. If so, 
<br>
the President can use this selectively, no? What am I missing?
<br>
<p>As for the ban on human cloning, that sounds harder, coz...
<br>
<p>(2) In the US or Australia, you have to find a constitutional head of power 
<br>
(such as the interstate commerce clause, which has been read *very* widely 
<br>
by the courts in the US) before the federal legislature can enact any law at 
<br>
all. Otherwise, legislative power is left entirely with the states, which 
<br>
can enact laws on any subject. (In Canada, the situation works in reverse: 
<br>
the provinces have enumerated powers with a default power to the national 
<br>
legislature to enact laws on anything.)
<br>
<p>It is widely commented upon here that it is not clear what power the federal 
<br>
legislature has to ban human cloning. It may have to fall back on the 
<br>
foreign affairs power, but I'm not aware what international treaties we may 
<br>
be party to that would require us to pass such legislation. Someone in the 
<br>
US might well ask the same question.
<br>
<p>My gut feeling is that there *are* issues about an appropriate head 
<br>
legislative power to support the relevant provision passed here in the 
<br>
Genetic Technology Act and that similar issues might arise with the 
<br>
legislation being dealt with currently by the US Congress. I would assume 
<br>
that these would get tested eventually.
<br>
<p>Or is Charles talking about...
<br>
<p>(3) a constitutional *restriction* on power, as opposed to the availability 
<br>
of an appropriate head of legislative power in the first place? If that's 
<br>
what he means, he may be right, though it's very open to argument. In the 
<br>
Martha Nussbaum and Cass Sunstein book _Clones and Clones_, Sunstein's 
<br>
contribution is a brilliant piece in which he writes two imaginary Supreme 
<br>
Court opinions, one for and one against the proposition that reproductive 
<br>
cloning (like contraception and abortion) falls within the supposed implied 
<br>
constitutional right of &quot;privacy&quot; in the US Bill of Rights. Anyone 
<br>
interested in *this* aspect of the US constitutional situation should start 
<br>
with Sunstein's piece.
<br>
<p>Any US journalist who wants a serious academic opinion on all this should 
<br>
approach Sunstein (I assume he's still at the University of Chicago) and see 
<br>
if he's prepared to comment.
<br>
