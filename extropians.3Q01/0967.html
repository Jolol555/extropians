In a case of bedfellows about as strange as they come, the ACLU has
<br>
joined with House Majority Leader Dick Armey, Republican from Texas,
<br>
to call for a halt to the use of facial recognition technology as a part
<br>
of government surveillance of American citizens.
<br>
<a href="http://www.aclu.org/news/2001/n071101a.html">http://www.aclu.org/news/2001/n071101a.html</a> reads:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past several days, a troubling expansion in the way
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technology is being used in the surveillance of ordinary Americans
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has come to light. In response, we are today joining together to call
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on all state and local governments to stop using these dangerous
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technologies now before privacy in America is so diminished that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it becomes nothing more than a fond memory.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majority Leader Armey will ask the General Accounting Office
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to study the extent to which the federal government is funding
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;facial-recognition technologies. In addition, he will ask the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relevant House Committees to hold hearings on law enforcement use
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of surveillance technology. The ACLU supports these requests.
<br>
<p>I doubt that Armey and the ACLU agree on much.  It's amazing how these new
<br>
issues are cutting across traditional political divisions.  Even with
<br>
the stem cell issue, Catholics are giving cover to Republicans for
<br>
support of research in this area, while the Protestant Right continues
<br>
to adopt an absolutist stance against it.  I wonder what new divisions
<br>
and realigments we will see as technology moves on.
<br>
