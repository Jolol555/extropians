<em>&gt; Sorry, but that is censorship if it is not at least tried to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; publish the works of a best selling author.  If she is &quot;barking

<em>&gt; mad&quot; by British norms (though I hardly think you speak for all

</em><br>
<p>Censorship, by definition, is action carried out by a government to
<br>
prevent publication or dissemination of ideas.
<br>
<p>There _is_ government censorship of literature in the UK; it's called
<br>
the Obscene Publications Act (1958), and it's applied primarily to sexual
<br>
material. There's a secondary categoriy of censorship imposed by the 
<br>
Race Relations Act -- actual incitement to racial violence is an offense,
<br>
and this can include written (or musical) material.
<br>
<p>Guess what: I'm not a fan of the OPA. I want to see it abolished. And I
<br>
think the RRA is badly flawed and over-broad in its reach.
<br>
<p>However, there's nothing in the OPA or the RRA about politics. Nor are
<br>
there any laws or regulations banning Rand from the UK. As Damien has 
<br>
pointed out -- and I stand corrected on this -- Rand was published 
<br>
over here ... before my time.
<br>
<p>She just appears to have slipped out of print, and stayed there for at 
<br>
least the last twenty-five years.
<br>
<p>* Is it &quot;censorship&quot; if an author doesn't try to sell reprint rights to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;their work after it goes out of print?
<br>
<p>* Is it &quot;censorship&quot; if an author dies and their executors don't try to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sell reprint rights to their work abroad?
<br>
<p>* Is it &quot;censorship&quot; if an author or their agents submit their work to a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;publisher and the publisher declines to print it because they don't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;think they can market it effectively?
<br>
<p>If you can assert with a straight face that any of those three situations 
<br>
constitute censorship, then I submit that you've got an excellent career
<br>
ahead of you in politics.
