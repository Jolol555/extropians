<p>Well, I have a little bit to add on that: I have an IQ of 160, as many
<br>
IQ tests will attest, yet the school counselors told my parents that my
<br>
IQ was only 125. I've heard similar stories from many other people who
<br>
are geniuses, and it's my opinion that the old &quot;IQ of 125&quot; is one of
<br>
those little scams that the teaching establishment does to eliminate
<br>
special treatment of genius kids.
<br>
<p>Those same counselors claimed I had the same IQ as my older brother, but
<br>
he was a dope to the point that we were taking the same math classes in
<br>
high school even though I was two years younger, and I was tutoring him
<br>
on the homework. I got A's on tests, he got C minuses on tests.
