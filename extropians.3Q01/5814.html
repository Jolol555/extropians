<br>
<p>Map inset sidebars:
<br>
<p><p>AFRICA
<br>
<p>Ethiopia loses northern Eritrea and Tigre to secession and southern
<br>
Ogaden to Somalia.  Kasai and mineral-rich Katanga secede from Zaire.
<br>
Sudan splits into two.  South Africa splits into three pieces,
<br>
creating &quot;Azania&quot; and &quot;Zululand&quot; in the process.
<br>
<p><p>ASIA
<br>
<p>In Russia, new states emerge in the Far East, the Urals, and East and West
<br>
Siberia; assorted small ethnic enclaves such as Tatarstan and Dogeston gain
<br>
independence, and places like Kaliningrad, Tuva and Buryat become virtually
<br>
independent autonomous zones.
<br>
<p>India loses Punjab and part of Kashmir, Afghanistan breaks into at least
<br>
three ethnic pieces.  A large part of Kazakhstan secedes to join Russia.
<br>
<p>Despite the longstanding dominance of the Han Chinese, Tibet and Xinjiang
<br>
move out on their own.  Taiwan is absorbed, while Inner Mongolia merges
<br>
with independent Mongolia.  Three new areas, Inner, North and Southeast
<br>
China, gain autonomy, while developed Guangdong and Shanghai become
<br>
quasi-independent economic hubs more like present-day Hong Kong than
<br>
Beijing.  The Philippines loses Muslim-dominated Mindinao.
<br>
<p><p>AUSTRALIA
<br>
<p>Breaks up into four pieces, giving birth to new states like &quot;Swanland,&quot;

in the north.
<br>
<p><p>EUROPE
<br>
<p>Samiland is carved from the northern Lapp-populated area of Norway,

<br>
<p>Vast change, explosion of new nations foreseen
<br>
<p>By Robin Wright
<br>
Los Angeles Times
<br>
<p>WASHINGTON --- Imagine a world in which Scotland gains independence from
<br>
the United Kingdom and Italy divides in half.  Russia and China both
<br>
fragment into a dizzying array of new states, and Canada disappears
<br>
altogether.
<br>
<p>Along the way, a host of new states --- including Samiland, Pushtunistan
<br>
and Zululand --- are born.
<br>
<p>And those are only a few of the possibilities that a panel of eminent
<br>
political geographers predict for the next decade as the world map is
<br>
redrawn.
<br>
<p>The scope of coming changes in the world's frontiers will be among the
<br>
most profound in history, they say, and the pace may set a record.
<br>
<p>&quot;What we're dealing with is the re-creation of countries,&quot; said William
<br>
Wood, the State Department's chief geographer.
<br>
<p>Over the next 25 to 30 years, the world roster may increase by 50 percent
<br>
or more.
<br>
<p>&quot;There'll be more than 300 countries,&quot; predicted Saul B. Cohen, past
<br>
president of the Association of American Geographers.
<br>
<p>Some of the changes these geographers foresee may seem logical probabilities;
<br>
others appear outlandish conjectures.  But they are made by people whose
<br>
occupation is studying the relationship of physical geography and national
<br>
borders to political culture, sociology and history.
<br>
<p>Moreover, in context, their forecasts for the turn of the century are
<br>
hardly out of line.  Even before the Summer Games in Barcelona were over
<br>
last year and the 172 teams that competed there headed for home, for
<br>
example, Olympic planners had started preparing for more than 200
<br>
participating states at the 1996 Atlanta Games.
<br>
<p>The political geographers do not agree on all the details of the future
<br>
world map.  But they do agree that recharting the globe will be the
<br>
byproduct of several concurrent trends, ranging from the powerful pull
<br>
of ethnicity and the spread of democracy to changes in the very concept
<br>
of a modern state.
<br>
<p>First, some borders will be altered as nations break away from
<br>
traditional states, as has happened painfully in Yugoslavia over the
<br>
past year and peacefully in Czechoslovakia.
<br>
<p>&quot;Borders of present countries or so-called natural boundaries will
<br>
increasingly lose their importance when they do not correspond to
<br>
well-recognized linguistic and territorial identities,&quot; said Fabrizio
<br>
Eva, an Italian geographer.
<br>
<p>Second, other new countries will be added as the last colonies become
<br>
independent countries --- the dominant trend during the second half of
<br>
the 20th century and evident most recently when the Soviet empire's
<br>
collapse spawned 15 new states.
<br>
<p>&quot;We are now in a major new phase of demands for 'self-determination' ---
<br>
demands which, if all are acceded to, will result in significant changes
<br>
to the world's political map at both state and sub-state levels,&quot; said
<br>
David B. Knight, chairman of a special Commission on the World Political
<br>
Map of the International Geographers Union.
<br>
<p>On a third and more sweeping level, the new lines on a map will be
<br>
produced by fundamental changes in the role of states, largely in
<br>
response to economic and social pressures and political alienation.
<br>
<p>&quot;The current changes in the political and economic geography of the world
<br>
are as significant as what the world went through after the Treaty of
<br>
Westphalia,&quot; said George Demko, a geographer and director of the
<br>
Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College.
<br>
<p>That 1648 peace accord, ending Europe's Thirty Years War, was a turning
<br>
point in the rise of modern states.
<br>
<p>&quot;As we're challenging the traditional ideas of state sovereignty,
<br>
globalizing economies and communications, and breaking up the last
<br>
empires, the geography of the world is unhooking old connections and
<br>
hooking up new ones,&quot; Demko said.
<br>
<p>&quot;Along with borders, the dynamics and functions of states will change, too.&quot;
<br>
<p>Much of the first two phases in the global reconfiguration may take place
<br>
within the next decade, but this part of the process is likely to last
<br>
well into the 21st century, geographers said.
<br>
<p>And the countries that emerge from the process may bear little
<br>
resemblance to today's states.
<br>
<p>&quot;Many states won't have armies, only police.  And some (new) states will
<br>
allow dual citizenship with former host countries, as in the Baltics with
<br>
the Russian population, or ethnic groups with their place of origin,&quot;
<br>
Cohen said.
<br>
<p>A stratified system of governance and power is likely to replace
<br>
traditional states.
<br>
<p>&quot;At the top will be a stronger United Nations or an equivalent body
<br>
responsible for peace, environment and other global issues,&quot; predicted
<br>
Julian Minghi, U.S. representative to the Geographical Union's
<br>
Commission on the World Political Map.
<br>
<p>He places such regional groupings as the European Community on the
<br>
second tier, while the tiny ethnically and linguistically based
<br>
miniature states of the future will be the lowest level.
<br>
<p>Already, at least 17 regional blocs --- from Latin America's Southern
<br>
Cone Common Market to Central Asia's Economic Cooperation Organization
<br>
--- are reshaping the globe.  The latest is the new continental pact
<br>
forming the North American Free Trade Agreement, completed earlier
<br>
this month among the United States, Canada and Mexico and awaiting
<br>
confirmation by those countries' legislatures.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's a bit radical,&quot; Minghi conceded of the idea that today's large
<br>
countries will break up to become tomorrow's tiny states.  &quot;But it's
<br>
what we're evolving toward.&quot;
<br>
<p>To avoid being marginalized in traditional states, for example,
<br>
communities are increasingly likely to seek smaller alternatives that
<br>
are more familiar, convenient and accountable to them, a trend more
<br>
important in larger or densely populated states.  The possibilities
<br>
range from Canada's Quebec to Iraq's Kurdistan.
<br>
<p>The dimensions of change are almost certain to provoke an international
<br>
debate over the next decade on a basic issue: Should the world's current
<br>
powers give priority to the right of self-determination, thereby
<br>
potentially threatening the current configuration of states?  Or should
<br>
they be committed to preserving territorial integrity --- potentially
<br>
at the expense of individual rights?
<br>
<p>The United States was founded on the principle of self-determination, but
<br>
since the onset of global change in 1989, Washington has supported
<br>
territorial integrity in both Yugoslavia and Iraq --- largely due to
<br>
fears of fragmentation and its rippling effect both in the Balkans and
<br>
the Persian Gulf.
<br>
<p>&quot;The tendency now and in the future will be to preserve the status quo,&quot;
<br>
said the State Department's Wood.  &quot;The United Nations is the best
<br>
example.  Its member states are recognized governments with control
<br>
over defined space.&quot;
<br>
<p>But experts at this month's 27th International Geographical Congress
<br>
in Washington suggested self-determination often will prevail.
<br>
<p>More than ever before, &quot;political movements are inclined toward a
<br>
subdivision within states,&quot; said Eva, the Italian geographer.
<br>
<p>Because up to a third of the world's current states face border
<br>
challenges either from neighboring nations or from minorities at home,
<br>
geographers already are urging steps to prevent repetitions of the
<br>
bloody conflict in what used to be Yugoslavia.
<br>
<p>&quot;What we will need is a U.N. commission on border modification to
<br>
adjudicate and initiate negotiations before fighting erupts,&quot; said
<br>
H.J. de Blij of Georgetown University.
<br>
<p>In the longer term, the political geographers think the importance of
<br>
borders will actually wane, as economic and technological interdependence
<br>
span not only states, but continents.
<br>
<p>&quot;The notion of boundaries as we've known them, in terms of absolute
<br>
sovereignty and legalities, will in time dwindle,&quot; Minghi said.
<br>
<p>In the meantime, however, the number of states will grow.
<br>
<p>&quot;For the next decade, we cannot stop the trend,&quot; Eva said.  &quot;Afterward,
<br>
the wish for cooperation will prevail.
<br>
<p>&quot;I am a pessimist for the next decade, but I'm optimistic over the
<br>
long term.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>PREDICTING HOW THE WORLD WILL SHAPE UP
<br>
Los Angeles Times
<br>
<p>A Log Angeles Times panel of political geographers offered several rules of
<br>
thumb about what physical features help determine whether a state will work
<br>
or fail.  Among them:
<br>
<p>* Long, thin states are problematic --- &quot;Elongated states run infrastructure
<br>
risks that more compact states do not have,&quot; said H.J. de Blij of
<br>
Georgetown University's Foreign Service Institute.  Over long distances,
<br>
highways, air links, social-service facilities and other basic needs
<br>
are costlier and less efficient.  Remoteness also spawns alienation.
<br>
<p>Example:  Italy may split between the industrialized north and the rural
<br>
and poorer south.
<br>
<p>&quot;In northern Italy, there's a strong anti-Rome movement.  People aren't
<br>
anti-Italian, but they don't want to subsidize a massive bureaucracy,
<br>
throwing money away on the south,&quot; said Julian Minghi, U.S. representative
<br>
to the International Geographical Union's Commission on the World
<br>
Political Map.  &quot;They want a separate economy and cultural identity
<br>
in the north.&quot;
<br>
<p>* Topography can spell trouble --- If ethnic, social or economic
<br>
disparities correlate with stark differences in a country's topography,
<br>
it can exacerbate pressure for border changes.
<br>
<p>Example: Peru is seen as a candidate for partition dividing the interior
<br>
mountains --- home to poorer Indians and mestizos --- and the comparatively
<br>
affluent, European-dominated coast.
<br>
<p>* Large states tend to have large problems --- &quot;On the one hand, large
<br>
states have a variety of resources and a lot of people to recruit for
<br>
the army,&quot; Minghi said.  &quot;But at the same time, they have a tremendous
<br>
area to defend and to integrate politically.&quot;
<br>
<p>Examples: India, Russia, Kazakhstan, Sudan, Zaire, China, Brazil and Canada.
<br>
<p><p>[INSET]
<br>
RE-MAPPING NORTH AMERICA
<br>
<p>Some may think of the U.S. borders as some of the most permanent in the
<br>
world, but even the United States is not immune from forces that a panel
<br>
of political geographers sees reshaping the globe.
<br>
<p>UNITED STATES AND CANADA
<br>
<p>The western United States and Canadian provinces integrate their economies
<br>
with Asia's Pacific Rim.  Alaska, British Columbia, Washington and Oregon
<br>
also may be emboldened to create their own &quot;zone,&quot; either autonomous or
<br>
independent.
<br>
<p>Geographers tentatively dub the new state, stretching from the Arctic's
<br>
Beaufort Sea to the sunny climes of northern California, &quot;Pacifica.&quot;
<br>
<p>Even after losing &quot;Pacifica&quot; and &quot;Angelica,&quot; the United States may be
<br>
vulnerable to further splits.  A map designed by Stanley D. Brunn, an
<br>
International Geographical Union panelist from the University of Kentucky,
<br>
divides America into nine other independent or autonomous zones, not
<br>
necessarily coinciding with current state boundaries.
<br>
<p>They include Gulf Coast Zone, pulling together Florida with the
<br>
southern parts(ports?) of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, and an
<br>
industry state grouping all of Michigan and Wisconsin, northern chunks
<br>
of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, and western Pennsylvania.
<br>
<p><p>CANADA
<br>
<p>Canada is wrangling to keep Quebec part of the country.  Over time,
<br>
Canada's stranded Maritimes could join the United States, while Alberta
<br>
and Saskatchewan merge and go on their way and the Indian- and
<br>
Eskimo-deominated north joins a polar confederation.
<br>
<p><p>UNITED STATES AND MEXICO
<br>
<p>On the other U.S. border, the increasingly fuzzy demarcation line between
<br>
the United States and Mexico could evolve into another new zone,
<br>
tentatively called, &quot;Angelica&quot; by geographers.  The rest of Mexico
<br>
may then fragment into three or more parts.
