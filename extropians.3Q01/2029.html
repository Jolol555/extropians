</em><br>
<p>Yes, I can see that this is the essential question from your viewpoint, and 
<br>
it is obviously a legitimate one.
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt;Does the answer evade the fact that taxes are collected by

</em><br>
<p>Good point. Ultimately all laws, including laws for the collection of taxes, 
<br>
are backed up by the coercive power of the state. I don't see how anyone 
<br>
could argue with you here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How do they argue that theft is ok?
</em><br>
<p>Well, hold on, though. Taxation is not literally theft. Within the norms of 
<br>
the legal system, taxation is justified by law. You may say that such laws 
<br>
are immoral or whatever, but the issue isn't whether tax is *actually* 
<br>
theft. It's not. The issue is surely whether such taking by the government 
<br>
is *morally equivalent* to theft, notwithstanding that it is underpinned by 
<br>
legislation etc. I think you have to agree with me on this just as a matter 
<br>
of fact (if you don't, we probably can't take it much further). However, 
<br>
you'll probably think I'm nitpicking. I could understand if that were your 
<br>
response, but I'm not sure that it is just nitpicking. The fact is that 
<br>
decisions have been made through the legal system as to what is theft and 
<br>
what isn't and a lot of people would assume that there are pretty good moral 
<br>
reasons for the distinctions that the system makes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Do they try to say taxes isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stolen money? This goes completely against my understanding of reality and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they will have to do some BIG time explaining to show me that one.
</em><br>
<p>Well, no, it isn't stolen money (see above). Again, what counts as 
<br>
&quot;stealing&quot; is defined by the norms of the legal system. The issue is whether 
<br>
those laws are open to moral criticism, whether having laws that allow for 
<br>
taxation is immoral, whether it is morally acceptable that the legal system 
<br>
does *not* count taxation as theft. So far you haven't given me an argument 
<br>
as to why you consider these things to be the case. I can *think* of 
<br>
arguments, but I can't see anywhere where you put one.
<br>
<p><p>Ill
<br>
<em>&gt;listen, but don't be surprised at me being skeptical. Something that goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against my logic to that extent, I will be sure to examine closely.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but it's &quot;your logic&quot;. :-)  I doubt that I could convince you that 
<br>
taxes are, or can be, morally permissible, but I'm just trying to understand 
<br>
why you are so sure they are not. I would think that you'd have to start off 
<br>
with a theory about when something becomes your property in a sense that 
<br>
precedes the norms of the legal system (after all, those same norms allow 
<br>
for taxes (!!!), so you have to rely on something deeper). And do you say 
<br>
there can never be a civic *responsibility* to give up some of your property 
<br>
(as defined) to contribute to the infrastructure of the society as a whole 
<br>
or to care for people in need? Do you say that there are never any values 
<br>
that can override your right to hang on to your property, no matter what 
<br>
moral catastrophe may be involved (you gave an example of someone about to 
<br>
physically melt down with a new form of cancer not having any moral claim 
<br>
over you)?
<br>
<p>I think I can see the internal logic of your position but I'm still not 
<br>
entirely sure what values underpin it, why anyone else should be convinced 
<br>
by what you say. Is it possible, for example, that your theory of property 
<br>
underpinned by a theory of desert (as in &quot;I deserve to have/keep this money 
<br>
because I worked for it&quot;; or &quot;I deserve this land because I've mixed my 
<br>
labour with it&quot;)? Do you believe that property that is acquired within the 
<br>
norms of the legal system is always deserved? Or do you think there is some 
<br>
kind of rougher fit between those norms and what should really be recognised 
<br>
as property? In that case, in what circumstances (either theoretical or in 
<br>
our actual society) is it or is it not deserved?
<br>
<p>See, most people, though they try to minimise their taxes in ways allowed by 
<br>
the law, don't see this particular kind of taking of their property as 
<br>
essentially immoral. Perhaps they see a kind of social duty to give 
<br>
something to pay for infrastructure that is available for everyone. Of 
<br>
course, they may be deluded. Perhaps this is actually a very inefficient way 
<br>
of providing for infrastructure! But assume that is not always the case. (Or 
<br>
is your political theory partly based on an economic theory that public 
<br>
expenditure is always wasteful and that there is no such a thing as market 
<br>
failure?)
<br>
<p>Just following through, what if the taxes are used to pay for your country's 
<br>
defence forces or for the police? Is that okay? Are there *any* exceptions 
<br>
to your opposition to taxes? Do you have a theory about when such exceptions 
<br>
are allowable? You may say &quot;no exceptions at all&quot;, for all I know. I'm just 
<br>
asking.
<br>
<p>I understand the points in the rest of your post but they don't answer the 
<br>
kinds of questions I'm asking.
<br>
<p>FWIW I can get impassioned about specific political issues, particularly 
<br>
when there are attempts to ban things on so-called &quot;moral&quot; grounds (I think 
<br>
there's a whole new batch of issues here, but your position must go beyond 
<br>
those issues, I think). Still I don't have any objection to paying my 
<br>
(lawfully minimised) taxes if they are spent on government programs that I 
<br>
think are reasonable. Yes, I am a bit inclined to say that your position is 
<br>
extreme, but I'm not strident about it. For all I know, you may be able to 
<br>
answer my questions and demonstrate that your position is absolutely 
<br>
correct.
<br>
<p>Over to you
<br>
<p>Regards
<br>
<p>Russell
