Lee quoted Spike:
<br>
<em>&gt; I say to hell with privacy (my own, not other people's). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dont flinch, dont blush, live open, upload, share the files
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with anyone who cares to read them.  spike
</em><br>
<p>And responded:
<br>
<em>&gt;I'll add that it is something that we easily could get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;used to, and I think that we'll be better off for it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;too.
</em><br>
<p>I don't disagree with this point of view, but it's a long-term view as far 
<br>
as I can tell.  As I've said repeatedly in discussions on this topic, it's 
<br>
the short term that concerns me in this discussion.  We can't get to our 
<br>
grand and glorious future except by surviving the short and medium term.  
<br>
Right now, many people are getting burned because society's institutions 
<br>
assume some things are secret, and that whoever knows the secret is the 
<br>
person who should have access to an account.  Since privacy is being 
<br>
eroded, the wrong people have access to too many things, and as a result, 
<br>
assets are being stolen, credit ratings are being sullied, and all manner 
<br>
of other bad things are happening.
<br>
<p>When we get to a society in which people understand how much care has to be 
<br>
taken to identify the rightful owner of something, or to correctly identify 
<br>
someone in order to store information about a transaction, and they 
<br>
understand how much reliance it is reasonable to place in those records, 
<br>
we'll do fine.
<br>
<p>The two things I'm most concerned about are (1) the backlash from people 
<br>
who are afraid of progress or uncomfortable with transparency (because 
<br>
their world view is based in recent past ability to protect privacy), and 
<br>
(2) the kinds of regulation those people will impose in order to keep the 
<br>
privacy situation from getting worse (in their view).  It could get 
<br>
seriously draconian in the medium term, and could make it very hard to work 
<br>
on some of the kinds of things we favor.
<br>
<p>Too much celebration of transparency, especially in terms of inevitibility 
<br>
and &quot;you'd better get used to it, 'cause you won't be able to stop it&quot; will 
<br>
fan the flames and make the backlash worse.  I've been trying to find ways 
<br>
to get the people I talk to to consider the possibility that change might 
<br>
happen and think about whether that future would be acceptable.  So far, I 
<br>
have had inconsistent successes.  Other than people who already &quot;get it&quot; on 
<br>
most subjects, throwing transparency in people's faces hasn't worked for me.
