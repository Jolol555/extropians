Actually, Fred Reed DOES state much more racist, sexist and homophobic things in other essays; you can check out a bunch of them at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.fredoneverything.net/ColMenu.html">http://www.fredoneverything.net/ColMenu.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm still waiting on someone to say what the racists statements,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; tones, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; attitudes have been said here. I haven't heard anyone make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; any racists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; statements. I haven't heard anyone say that any particular race was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; inherently superior. I've heard bigoted ones, and I've heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; discriminatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; I know this may seem like nitpicking definitions, but its important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; that words keep their meanings else more confusion erupts. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; your going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; use the word racist, please have the common courtesy to know what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; it means,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; and how it differs from bigoted and discriminatory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Examples:  The article clearly blames welfare, crime, large police
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; departments, violence and fear on blacks only.  It claims 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; without blacks do not have these problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ive gone back and tried to locate the original artical, but I think Ive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already deleted it, so I cant verify your particular interpretation of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;descriptions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Look, I dont believe that genetics play into peoples behavior per se, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do believe theres some major cultural differences. My problem is, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;called racist when a white person even brings up the fact that blacks have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disparate percentage of crime or other cultural problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  It clearly states that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; author could determine the race of the bad teacher by the bad skills,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; obviously because only blacks would show such poor skills 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; while whites would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Maybe he was privy to &quot;actual&quot; statistics that verify a larger percentage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;teachers that are black are underqualified, I dont know. If thats the case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then he could say with a statistical probablity that such a thing is true. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dont recall him saying his premonition on this 100 percent, but I could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The article clearly attributes an unsolved murder and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; unsolved thefts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to blacks under the assumptions that whites wouldn't commit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; those crimes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Once again, this could be a statistical statement... and whites most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certainly COULD have commited it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The article clearly attributes civilization, science and the wheel to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; whites.  It claims that technology, such as Microsoft 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; products, are produced
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; by whites.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Once more statistical. Blacks most certainly are capable, but it turned out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that whites generally beat them to the punch on most the inventions of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last few centuries. Theres a hundred theories, but one Ive read lately was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the book &quot;Germ, Guns, and Steel&quot; (I may have that backwards). The book does
</em><br>
<em>&gt;its best to explain why the Spaniards started conquering in South America
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and not the inverse and other disparencies. His statement that Microsoft was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;produced by whites is correct. Bill Gates is in fact....White (just ribbing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ya there, blacks similarly trained and in a similar position would have made
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it just the same).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The author does not even seem to imagine that any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; blacks could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have ever contributed to any technology company such as Microsoft.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I dont know that we can invade his mind to say what he actually believes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thats blacks are incapable of such inovation. I dont belive that, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wouldnt conclude that someone else belives that simply because they had made
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the observation that historically, whites have produced more inventions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Furthermore, the author claims that blacks are incapable of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; duplicating the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; achievements of whites.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If he said that, I would disagree and say hes wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; He expresses the desire that blacks 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; were capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; studying or achieving academic degrees by their own merit, as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; if blacks were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; incapable of higher learning, and implying that all academic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; degrees earned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; by blacks were faked.  The author claims that only whites can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; achieve higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; levels of academic or civilized achievement, while blacks are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; incapable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; achieving the same level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Once again, I would disagree with him if that was what was exactly said. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will note that theres a certainly tendancy for grade dilution these days,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but thats not just race based. Its my opinion based on my reading that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;degrees are easier to get then they were 100 years ago in general.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I am (in)famous on this list for playing devil's advocate, giving the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; benefit of the doubt, and for assuming the honest intentions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of posters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; But even I cannot imagine how anybody can seriously consider 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; real article and not a blatant hate-filled ad hominem attack. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that it violates many of the list rules and should not be on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Only the fact that it was not aimed at specific list members 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; has prevented
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; me from seeking a ban on this topic and the posters who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; distributed this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; garbage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Please dont get me wrong, I am not defending someone if they honestly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe that one race is inherently superior. I am simply trying to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;someone from being railroaded because they state facts, that while may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;true, are not politically correct. I didnt have the original email and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;havent heard any of the particulars you state here discussed. Just the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attacks on him in general for putting forth &quot;The Email&quot;. Your not going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find anyone more individualistic then me anywhere and I always try to look
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at a person as an individual then a group. But Im not going to pretend that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their arnt serious issues that need to be dealth with about certain groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of people (not just US based urban blacks). Well never solve them unless you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;identify them and face them head on.
