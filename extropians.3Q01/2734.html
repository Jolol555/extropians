<p>Well obviously!  Maybe my point was not clear.  My point is that you are 
<br>
expecting the libertarian government NOT to act rationally in its own 
<br>
self-interest.  This contradicts what libertarians want -- they want people 
<br>
to act rationally in their own self-interest.  Why would you expect a 
<br>
libertarian government to act altruistically, when you would not expect a 
<br>
business to act altruistically?
