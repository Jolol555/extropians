Mike quoted me quoting him
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt;If you choose to drive, or to walk beside a road, you are voluntarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;assuming the risk that you could be in an accident with another car that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;is out of your control.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Then quoted me:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; That's not the position in any legal system I know of. I'm not aware that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; volenti non fit injuria has ever been accepted as a defence in motor
</em><br>
vehicle
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; accident case--anywhere. We do *not* consent to negligent or reckless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; driving by (other) motorists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>And replied at some length, including:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think you are misunderstanding my words. Acceptance of risk is not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same as acceptance of responsibility. We do have a concept here in NH
</em><br>
<em>&gt;called caveat emptor: &quot;buyer beware&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, this is a principle in all common law systems, though increasingly
<br>
eroded by legislation and case law.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You engage in risky activity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;voluntarily, and cannot hold others responsible for your lack of due
</em><br>
<em>&gt;diligence, but you can hold them responsible for actions outside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;envelope.
</em><br>
<p><p>Actually, I agree with a lot of Mike's reply - I don't have time to dissect
<br>
it sentence by sentence. However, the original formulation I've quoted above
<br>
seemed to me a pretty extreme one, at least without all these
<br>
qualifications.
<br>
<p>However, to say that driving in a car is analogous to smoking, which I
<br>
*thought* Mike was arguing, you'd have to have a stronger principle than
<br>
this. The difference is that when you walk beside the road or get in a
<br>
vehicle you *don't take responsibility* for the negligence or recklessness
<br>
of others. You don't &quot;consent&quot;, as I put it. Sure, you can insure yourself
<br>
against it, but that doesn't make you responsible for it. For you may
<br>
acknowledge the risk, but I'd be disinclined to use Mike's word that you
<br>
&quot;accept&quot; it. This is underlined by the fact that many jurisdictions have
<br>
compulsory third-party insurance, whereas it is, to say the least, uncommon
<br>
for the state to require first-party insurance.
<br>
<p>When you take up smoking (particularly if you do so as an adult), by
<br>
contrast, you damn well ought to take responsibility for the consequences of
<br>
your decision to do so.
<br>
<p>Another contrast is with taking up a dangerous sport such as boxing. Here,
<br>
you actually do take responsibility for the consequences of someone else
<br>
deliberately trying to hurt you (whereas you're never responsible for the
<br>
action of someone else deliberately using their car as a weapon). What you
<br>
don't take responsibility for in a boxing match, however, is the consequence
<br>
of someone deliberately or negligently stepping outside the rules and giving
<br>
you a karate kick or something.
<br>
<p>On that note, if I've lost the thread of this discussion - or if I've read
<br>
too much into it - and this analysis is inapposite, I'm man enough to be
<br>
told so and take my lumps.  :)
