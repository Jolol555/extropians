<em>&gt; It makes me feel sad that some people feel so unconcerned at the thought of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; school exists? There is this waving of arms and saying &quot;Leave it to the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; education... and backwards we march to the bad old days.
</em><br>
<p><p>Did you completely ignore my last post on this subject?  I don't know what
<br>
things were like in Australia, but in the US we've have at least a century
<br>
of both purely private education and purely public education, and a long
<br>
period where the two overlapped.  There is a lot of well-recorded history on
<br>
the subject in this country, and education was considered extremely
<br>
important culturally in the Americas.  Education *was* better when it was
<br>
completely private and more poor people got a better education.  It isn't
<br>
really even in dispute.  Who's waving arms?
<br>
<p>What I didn't mention was the years in the early 19th century when there was
<br>
both public AND private education equally available in the U.S.  By the very
<br>
admission of the States at that time, the public educational system was
<br>
deplorable and people simply chose to continue using private education
<br>
versus going to the public schools offered by the State.  By the second half
<br>
of the 19th century, rather than admitting failure and giving up on public
<br>
education, the States started passing series of laws that essentially forced
<br>
poor people to attend the public schools and shut down most of the private
<br>
schools.  Typical government bureaucracy: rather than fixing the reason
<br>
people ignore the public schools, they simply force people to use the
<br>
inferior public schools.  And that is the legacy we have to work with.
<br>
Incidentally many of the (bad) ideas on public education instituted by the
<br>
various governments in this country were directly borrowed from the British
<br>
and other Europeans; prior to that, the U.S. had a somewhat unique
<br>
educational tradition that served it quite well.
<br>
<p>As I said, I don't know what Australia's history is, but in *this* country
<br>
the poor had educational opportunity even when it was purely a free market
<br>
system.  And by all the statistics, the poor received a better relative
<br>
education during that time than they ever have through the public school
<br>
system.  So tell me again how public education and the government helped the
<br>
poor people.
