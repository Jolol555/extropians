Has anyone heard of or tried EPrime speech? From what I read Aristotle
<br>
is credited with the metaphor, other forms of &quot;identity&quot; speech, and for
<br>
the most part essentialism. EPrime speech was created as an alternative
<br>
to &quot;Aristotelian Essentialism&quot; which forms much of the foundation of
<br>
Western thought.
<br>
<p>I did some reading on the subject and it was very enlightening. As most
<br>
have been able to tell I am against essentialism as much as a person
<br>
could possibly be, along with ontology and the rest of it. So I tried
<br>
doing the EPrime thing. I enjoyed it. Trying to avoid using the words
<br>
am, are, be, is, was, were, been, and being is quite a challenge. As was
<br>
the claim I sensed a small increase in mental ability, just trying it. I
<br>
am not willing however to put my entire life on hold while I retrain to
<br>
do without metaphors.
<br>
<p>I've gone through a couple of major changes in my life which moved me
<br>
away from essentialism and realism. Becoming an atheist was the first
<br>
thing, after years of being a religious zealot who prided himself on an
<br>
ability to maintain black and white thinking. The second change was my
<br>
submission at long last to object oriented computer programming, and
<br>
many of the new relational models in use today.
<br>
<p>I'm a bit in the middle on things. To present I have not succumbed to
<br>
being total mush. I still like a little definition, structure, identity,
<br>
or some synonym of that. But I've learned it's OK to make up my own. I
<br>
have come to think the problem is not definition as such, but authority,
<br>
and the force feeding of definitions and objectifications by society. A
<br>
person can have his own, and no approval is necessary.
<br>
<p>Frankly, I want no more of Aristotle's little packages, including any
<br>
human potential packages.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Today I' m going to bring up a fellow from Ancient Greece that should be discussed more: Aristotle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In the classical, Socratic tradition philosophy is a seeking of the right goals for both the lives of men and of governments. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Both Plato and Aristotle think that this is the purpose of philosophy. It means that  social sciences and political philosophy are closely related to ethics.
