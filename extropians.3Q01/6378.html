<div style='background-color:'><DIV>&nbsp;I'm reminded of a recent letter posted on vdare.com, commenting on the media coverage of the "Asian rioting" in England, which today looks fairly prescient.&nbsp; The writer points out that what was given the blanket description of "Asian" rioting in the media was, more precisely, rioting by Bangladeshi and Pakistani Muslims.&nbsp; He goes on to note that most of the trouble spots in the world involve Muslims in friction with non-Muslims.&nbsp; To his quick list I would add Nigeria, where Christian-Muslim fighting&nbsp;has been taking quite a toll recently, and unfortunately has escalated after 9.11.01.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Disclaimer: There have been a number of postings in recent months implying guilt-by-association, so I want to make clear that I do not advocate the views put forward by vdare writers.&nbsp; This letter, from an&nbsp;American&nbsp;Indian immigrant, is actually taking exception to one of their articles.&nbsp; This is one of a very wide variety of on-line periodicals I&nbsp;browse from time to time (I also read thenation.com, for example, although I'm not a leftist).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>(FYI, the letter was sent on July 22, 2001.&nbsp; The writer apparently wished to remain anonymous, identifying himself only as "Indian Immigrant").</DIV>

<DIV>TODAY'S LETTER: "Indian Immigrant" Comments On "Asian Rioting"</DIV>
<DIV>
<P>From: "Indian Immigrant"</P>

<P>In May, race riots erupted in Oldham and three other northern British cities when mainly Asian immigrants attacked white-owned shops and bars, burned cars and beat up cops and civilians alike.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I think in the interest of accuracy, you should look into who these "Asians" are. They are actually Pakistani and Bangladeshi underclass. (If there are any Chinese/Indian/Korean/Japanese rioting, that would be news to me.) It is my hypothesis that it is not so much their race as much as the Islamic religion which propels them to violence. Look at Palestine, Lebanon, Albania, Afghanistan,&nbsp; Chechnia,&nbsp; Pakistan, Kashmir etc., Wherever the unassimilated Moslems are in majority or near majority, they start developing friction with the native country people. One can ignore analyzing this phenomenon only at the risk of ignoring a major sociological global crisis of today which will only grow worse. After all the World Trade Center, Embassy bombings, Khobar towers, U.S.S. Cole etc. experience, one would expect you to&nbsp; do better than use a broad brush term like "Asian" to describe Islamic violence. It is about as precise as describing Balkan problem or British-Irish unrest as "European" rioting.</P></DIV>
