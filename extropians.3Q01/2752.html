<p><p>Huh?  In our system of law, the sins of the father are not visited upon the
<br>
son.  If my great-grandfather killed someone and profited by it, you can't
<br>
come after me for the murder.  And if you apply an &quot;ill-gotten gains&quot;
<br>
argument, you will have to quantify precisely how money I earned at my job
<br>
can be directly traced to an ill-gotten gain, since I never inherited
<br>
anything from my great-grandfather other than his name.
<br>
<p>It is as simple as that.  If you can directly trace any asset I own as an
<br>
ill-gotten gain from slavery, I suppose I could give it up to the rightful
<br>
owners without a problem.  But since I grew up and lived most of my life
<br>
destitute, with everything I own being the result of years of easily
<br>
documented sacrifice and hard work, I think you'll have hard time.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
