<p>Well, my point isn't particularly important. I was more interested in 
<br>
people's ideas on the origin of ideas, rather than any practical consequences 
<br>
of a resolution to that issue. I just felt like I ought to try to make some 
<br>
connection to the purpose of this list. Anyway, I didn't mean to imply that 
<br>
augmenting intelligence and changing the cultural climate are mutually 
<br>
exclusive means. In your example, if a group of chimps wanted to have 
<br>
human-level intelligence, and realized that many technological breakthroughs 
<br>
would be required to acheive this, they could either try to spread their 
<br>
ideas throughout chimp society, or they could seek out whatever minor 
<br>
intelligence improvements they could in order to be able to themselves come 
<br>
up with these breakthroughs. More likely, they'd do both. The question is how 
<br>
much of each energy to devote to each strategy (at the expense of the other).
<br>
This is all rather impractical anyway. We won't be able to resolve with any 
<br>
certainty the &quot;etiology&quot; of innovation.
