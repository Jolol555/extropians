<p>Here, here (I've been watching Masterpiece theatre tonight...)

<p>Yes of course -- take out the SOS response that actually
<br>
*increases* the mutation rate, then paste on some of the

Deinococcus radiodurans repair mechanisms, then do some

molecular modeling to improve the proof-reading.  You

can drive the error rate very low.

<p>I love it on those rare instances when I'm actually ahead
<br>
of Anders on the curve... :-)
<br>
<p>First you make the genetic code brittle in terms of no
<br>
&quot;redundancy&quot;.  To do this optimally, you have to study
<br>
the mechanisms driving transition &amp; transversion frequencies
<br>
(<a href="http://www.iona.edu/faculty/csackerson/genetics/mutation.htm">http://www.iona.edu/faculty/csackerson/genetics/mutation.htm</a>)
<br>
and &quot;rig&quot; the code such that the most likely mutations
<br>
generate either STOP codons or &quot;radical&quot; amino-acid changes
<br>
(i.e. + charge to - charge, hydrophobic to hydrophilic, etc.).
<br>
I haven't tried to do this yet -- I suspect to really
<br>
get it right requires a fair amount of simulation based
<br>
on existing genomes.
<br>
<p>It looks like one of the things you really want to do is
<br>
disable insertion sequences/retrotransposons (the July
<br>
20 Science paper on the virulent strain of S. pneumoniae
<br>
says its got a genome with 5% insertion sequences --
<br>
much higher than most bacteria).  So probably you want
<br>
to add in transcription sequences for anti-sense RNA
<br>
to any known sequences that can hop around.
<br>
<p>You can drive the mutation rate to very low levels if
<br>
you work on it enough.  Nature doesn't generally seek
<br>
really low mutation rates, so this is an unexplored
<br>
part of the phase space.

<p>It doesn't have to be a &quot;synthetic&quot; amino acid -- you can simply
<br>
delete the synthesis pathways for a couple of the more essential
<br>
amino acids.  If you have changed the &quot;code&quot;, then horizontal
<br>
gene transfers from existing organisms coding for those genes
<br>
isn't going to do you any good.
<br>
<p>Back to Anders:
<br>
<em>&gt; I wouldn't want to bet that for a given simple organic molecule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is *no* metabolic pathway in the biosphere that produces it.
</em><br>
<p>True, but if that pathway only exists in organisms found in deep
<br>
sea vents, its going to be hard to transfer it to a field in Iowa.
<br>
Plus(!), if the genetic code is different, the transfer of the
<br>
pathway is worthless.  The risk is the probability that the transfer
<br>
of &quot;random&quot; DNA is likely to produce a functional pathway in the
<br>
organism with an alternate genetic code.  If I transfer random bits
<br>
off of my Cisco router (with a 68000 processor) what is the probability
<br>
that I will get executable code on my PC?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Linda Nagata did a nice trick in her _Limit of Vision_ to show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how you could get around such a metabolic constraint on a GMO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both short term and long term
</em><br>
<p>I'll have to read that -- I'm suspicious that she may have leaped
<br>
the fence of statistical improbability.  If there your error rate is
<br>
10^-50, *it* can happen, but I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think one has to base the metabolic key on something more tricky to

</em><br>
<p>One or more patents are forthcoming... :-)

<em>&gt; I envision mass production of billions of nano components for

</em><br>
<p>Yep, one micro-organism per part.  Its more expensive than you
<br>
would think however to get there.  Its going to require a
<br>
non-trivial amount of software engineering to leap the gap.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It might not have the wide potential of hard drextech, but it

</em><br>
<p>You have to realize Eliezer, that the 40 trillion bacteria living
<br>
on or in your body *would* eat you, *if* they could.  Their &quot;creativity&quot;
<br>
potential hasn't reached the point where they pose a serious threat
<br>
to your continued existence.  The S. pneumoniae example I cite
<br>
above is a good example of evolution mastering &quot;creativity^2&quot;.
<br>
It isn't enough to simply be able to mutate random letters in
<br>
the genetic code -- several billion years of evolution may
<br>
have done that and not produced very much because most mutations
<br>
are dead-ends in the phase space.  When you learn how to take
<br>
&quot;working&quot; sequences, replicate them, and dedicate them to other
<br>
purposes, now you have speeded up evolution significantly.
<br>
<p>I'd predict that the Cambrian Explosion
<br>
(<a href="http://www.wf.carleton.ca/Museum/camex/1ahome.html">http://www.wf.carleton.ca/Museum/camex/1ahome.html</a>)
<br>
probably was associated with the development of retrotransposons.
<br>
(How else do you get to copy the homeobox genes resulting in
<br>
body patterning?)
<br>
<p>Now, &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; (ID) is about to produce &quot;creativity^3&quot;.
<br>
So I'd predict that since ID will be able to minimize creativity^1
<br>
and creativity^2 it is going to triumph big-time.  That isn't to
<br>
say that ID might not be able to produce creativity^3.5 --
<br>
but it isn't clear to me how one would do that without AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I'd still be worried about the new organisms learning how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce the synthetic amino acid on their own using chemical processes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if the original amino acid included a rare atomic type as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integral part of the chemistry, I'd still be worried about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organism learning to build a substitute.
</em><br>
<p>Enzymes have little ability to distinguish isotopes.  The
<br>
incorporation of isotopes into biomaterial is based on simple
<br>
statistical mechanics regarding the abundance of the isotopes and
<br>
their mobility (based on mass) of being more bio-available.
<br>
<p>Regarding the organisms &quot;learning&quot; how to produce a natural
<br>
(or synthetic) amino acid -- creativity^1 is going to take
<br>
a *long* time (with an alternate genetic code); creativity^2
<br>
has a better chance but it depends on the similarity of
<br>
the path to pre-existing paths and the rate of creativity^1.
<br>
Suppression of both levels of creativity is going to make
<br>
it difficult for the organism to &quot;learn&quot;.  (I'd say &quot;learn&quot;
<br>
is a poor description of the process -- &quot;discover&quot; might be
<br>
more appropriate.)
<br>
<p>Furthermore, there are ways you can engineer into organisms
<br>
&quot;fail-safes&quot; that would prevent them from deviating much from
<br>
their &quot;pre-programmed&quot; path without self-destructing.  Whether
<br>
these would be necessary is unclear to me at this time.
