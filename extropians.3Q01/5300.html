Here is the quote I was referring to yesterday:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underlying the gun control struggle is a fundamental division in
<br>
our nation. The intensity of passion on this issue suggests to me
<br>
that we are experiencing a sort of low-grade war going on between
<br>
two alternative views of what America is and ought to be. On one
<br>
side are those who take bourgeois Europe as a model of civilized
<br>
society: a society just, equitable, and democratic; but well
<br>
ordered, with lines of authority clearly drawn, and with decisions
<br>
made rationally and correctly by intelligent men for the entire
<br>
nation. To such people, hunting is atavistic, personal violence is
<br>
shameful, and uncontrolled gun ownership is a blot upon
<br>
civilization
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side is a group of people who do not tend to be
<br>
especially articulate or literate, and whose world view is rarely
<br>
expressed in print. Their model is that of the independent
<br>
frontiersman who takes care of himself and his family with no
<br>
interference from the state. They are &quot;conservative&quot; in the sense
<br>
that they cling to America's unique pre-modern tradition-a non-
<br>
feudal society with a sort of medieval liberty at large for
<br>
everyman. The these people &quot;sociological&quot; is an epithet. Life is
<br>
tough and competitive. Manhood means responsibility and caring for
<br>
your own.
<br>

<br>
Public Interest 45 (Fall 1976) P.61

<br>
America Adopt the Gun Controls of other Democracies? By David B.

<br>
<p>I feel this is a must read book to understand this issue.
