<em>&gt; I claim that Emlyn and Olga have accused the &quot;essay&quot; by Fred Reed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as being racist, and have posted questioning remarks about both it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and J.R. Molloy who unleashed it on this list.  I would appreciate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know what is seen as the worst of its racist claims, innuendos,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or remarks, so that something concrete could be focused upon, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we might perhaps all come to a consensus about.  (My own recall of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is a little vague, right now.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As an appendix to this post, I reproduce the &quot;essay&quot; in question.
</em><br>
<p><p>Good idea! The race baiters find it easy to throw around the accusation of
<br>
racism, but in this case they will find it impossible to prove. Racists are
<br>
despicable.
<br>
More despicable are liars who falsely accuse others of racism.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Thank you for speaking out, Emlyn!

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I searched out a few other Fred Reed articles, and he's a joke (in the
</em><br>
worst
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sense).   Fred Reed does not write satire (the concept seems too subtle
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; him) ... at bottom, he's serious as a heart attack about his beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (although J.R. Molloy may have meant it as satire ... I'm beginning not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be surprised at such things on this list, unfortunately).

<em>&gt; Fred Plops For Reparations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sells Out To Johnny Cochran
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see by the papers in the Yankee Capital that Johnny Cochran, and of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jesse and Al, are wheezing and blowing like a county-fair calliope with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaky boiler. They always are. This time it was about the need to pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reparations for the ravages trala of slavery. It got me to thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hate it when that happens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, I know I'm hard-hearted, and mean-spirited, and no damn good. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably my only virtue. But on consideration, I realized that they might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right. The ravages of slavery do run deep, and cause motingator trouble,
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt; no end in sight. I decided that compensation was only reasonable. Sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you don't like a conclusion, but you have to reach it. All right. I'll be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; man about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can pay me reparations, Johnny.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To start with, I figure you owe me for three bicycles. Maybe it's a small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing, but I'm tired of losing bicycles. Are we talking market value or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replacement? What I really want to be paid for is having to keep my latest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two-wheeler in my living room. Do you know how many times I've knocked the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fool thing over? And, oh, the scratch in my granddad's antique desk that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brake lever made. What's that worth?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Call it three grand. OK? Direct deposit would be nice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But . . . how do we dollarize cultural retrogression? God knows I appreciate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your offer of reparations, but I'm having trouble with the arithmetic. Help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A few years back, my middle-school daughter brought home a horrendously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misspelled science hand-out. Now, Johnny: You and I both know that it's easy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make a typo, and write &quot;phenylkeetone&quot; instead of &quot;phenylketone.&quot; But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;feemelkeebome&quot; is stretching it. The errors were of this sort. An
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of chemistry clearly had never rippled the serene surface of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; woman's mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without thinking, I asked, &quot;What color is your teacher?&quot; (If I had thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carefully, I would have asked, &quot;What color is your teacher?&quot;) My daughter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responded with an anguished, &quot;Da-d-d-d-y!&quot; She had made the connection, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knew she wasn't supposed to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've got no problem with black teachers, if they are competent. No problem
</em><br>
at
<br>
<em>&gt; all. But a teacher who is too ignorant to spell her subject, and too lazy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use a dictionary, ought to be flipping burgers. Simple burgers, with no
</em><br>
moving
<br>
<em>&gt; parts. Thing is, we can't fire ignorant teachers, Johnny, because of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lingering effects of slavery. I can yell at an ignorant white teacher, but
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; at a black one. To expect blacks to meet standards is racist. You can send
</em><br>
me
<br>
<em>&gt; the price of four years of tuition in a private school outside the country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the cost of permanent welfare? Subsidized everything? Enormous police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; departments? What do you figure? Just add it to your tab. Have you thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about setting up an endowment?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But here's a large ravage of slavery, Johnny: Fear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What price do we put on looking over our shoulders? On watching to be sure
</em><br>
we
<br>
<em>&gt; don't go one subway stop too far? Warning our girlfriends not to drive on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain streets? Checking the clientele of Seven-Eleven before going in at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; night?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People in, say, Switzerland can walk their streets after dark. We can't.
</em><br>
Why?
<br>
<em>&gt; What have we got that they don't, that might cause fear?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Elvis impersonators, Johnny. Yep. Switzerland doesn't have any Elvis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impersonators. Check for yourself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's fear worth? Is it a minimum-wage job? Forty-hour week or twenty-four
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hours a day? Benefits? Seniority pay as people grow older, weaker, and less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to defend themselves? You see the actuarial difficulty. Accounting is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more difficult trade than you might think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The white guy beaten to death 100 yards from my door last year - they never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caught the killers, but - what you reckon, Johnny? Do you figure it was
</em><br>
white
<br>
<em>&gt; Presbyterian women from the old-ladies' home? That's my guess. That's who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually does it. Anyway, you can send me $540 for the Sig 9mm pistol I
</em><br>
bought
<br>
<em>&gt; after blacks started moving into the neighborhood and crime went up. And
</em><br>
ammo,
<br>
<em>&gt; carry permit, Hydra-Shock rounds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, millions of honest blacks might write and say, &quot;Fred, we aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criminals. Why should we pay for what other blacks do?&quot; Splendid question.
</em><br>
But
<br>
<em>&gt; of course whites say, &quot;We don't have any slaves. Why should we pay for what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some other whites did?&quot; If it is a reasonable question for blacks to ask, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed it is, why isn't it a reasonable question for whites to ask?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But while you are in a mood to pay up, Johnny, let me introduce a useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept: Civilizational rent. You'll like this. It's such a good idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A culture is essentially software. No? Sure, there are physical embodiments:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positron-emission scanners, high-bypass turbofans, radar with Doppler
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beam-sharpening. Yet basically a culture is a body of knowledge, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft Word. (All right, throw in values. But I don't want to make this
</em><br>
too
<br>
<em>&gt; difficult.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; White guys invented these things at considerable cost. We had to. Europe
</em><br>
doesn
<br>
<em>&gt; 't have much low-hanging fruit, and it gets cold in the north. So
</em><br>
generations
<br>
<em>&gt; of people that I'm sure you're familiar with - Newton, Leibniz, Galois,
</em><br>
Gauss,
<br>
<em>&gt; Carnot, Dirac - did work that led to all kinds of useful . . . you know . .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Western civilization, it's called.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a result of slavery, you have been using our civilization without a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; license. (I know: You're having trouble with the idea of implied retroactive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptance of a license I invented five minutes ago. Microsoft would grasp
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; in a heartbeat. Anyway, I'm writing the column.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Further, you've been using it for a long time, Johnny. Air-conditioning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Roads. Writing. The wheel. Complicated stuff like that. Medicine. Tractors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shoes. Houses. I've spent time in Africa, where people live in stick things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that look as if a Cub Scout had built a campfire and forgotten to light it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're getting a deal here, Johnny.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't wish stick houses on anyone. I'm glad you have the benefits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electricity, clothes, and daytime TV. I'd love to see blacks study, earn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degrees on their merits, prosper. Think of the trouble it would save. But -
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; suggested by your manly desire to pay reparations -- you owe us licensing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fees. Granted, it's hard to set a price on a culture. But if Microsoft
</em><br>
Office
<br>
<em>&gt; goes for $250 at fire-sale prices, I guess a whole civilization is cheap at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $100K a copy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe we can do business, Johnny. I hope so. I can use the money.
