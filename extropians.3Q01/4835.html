</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK. :-) Do you remember why these people are called poor? It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they don't have money. Given the choice between putting food

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing and ensure that kids of the poor have a chance at a 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>Let me get the big question out of the way here:
<br>
<p>Do you have some way magic way that you are projecting the number of this
<br>
underclass would be worth caring about? If its less then 1 percent, then it
<br>
shouldn't erupt into this volcano of rioting and burning that's being
<br>
insinuated (I know, that's insensitive, but so is life).
<br>
<p>Now on to the economics of this.
<br>
<p>Id be willing to bet these poor people you talk about have cable TV, air
<br>
conditioning, play lottery, and generally have more money then you suspect
<br>
(at least that's the poor I get to see and know). Most of the state
<br>
lotteries are financed from incomes from below 25k a year. Sooooo, what we
<br>
have is a situation where the people most certainly DO have the money, but
<br>
choose to do stupid things with it. So, because I work hard, studied, and
<br>
now make a pretty comfortable living, the burden shifts over to me. My sin?
<br>
Hard work. What the primary feature they possess that enables them to raid
<br>
my wealth? Slothfulness and stupidity.
<br>
<p>On another note, they might have more money (if they didn't blow it all) if
<br>
you remove their taxes responsible for schools and education.
<br>
<p>The market ALWAYS seeks to balance itself. If producers won the game and
<br>
charge a million dollars for a spot in a school desk, guess what, no
<br>
students. If the consumer wins and pays 1 cent for the same desk, guess
<br>
what? No producers. The market works and the only alternative is human
<br>
judgment (which I have less faith in).
<br>
<p>Oh, now that I think about it, whose to say their wouldn't be FREE schools
<br>
for those suffering in squalor. Charity based organizations pop up
<br>
hospitals, libraries, and other structures all over the place, why not with
<br>
schools? They don't now because the government picks up the slack from
<br>
private industry (actually, the government has stolen most market).
<br>
<p>I put forth the premise that in such a society, there would be so much
<br>
productivity and wealth, you would have to hide to get people from throwing
<br>
decent jobs at you (as in now, even in a market slowdown, the US is
<br>
seriously needing immigrant workers because there's no one here willing to
<br>
do the work). At the point a society becomes primarily free market driven,
<br>
the only reason NOT to have enough wealth to live comfortably is because of
<br>
choice. In short, they made their bed and I'm not making it up for them. If
<br>
you can demonstrate that these people would constitute enough of a number to
<br>
really care about (damn being insensitive again), then I'm all ears on how
<br>
to teach them to work hard and smart as long as I am not forced to assist
<br>
against my will. Catch me on a good day and I can be quiet generous.
