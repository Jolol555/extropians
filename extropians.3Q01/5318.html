<em>&gt; Here is what Steven Weinberg says about Kuhn in this context:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;In his celebrated book...Kuhn went a step further and argued that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific revolutions the standards by which scientists judge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories change, so that the new theories simply cannot be judged by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the pre-Revolutionary standards.
</em><br>
<p>I'll look again, but my recollection is that Kuhn's sense of &quot;the new 
<br>
theories simply cannot be judged by the pre-Revolutionary standards&quot; 
<br>
weren't so much because of changes in scientists' standards about what 
<br>
makes good science, but because of contemporary scientists' choices about 
<br>
which questions were interesting.  I can easily imagine that those who want 
<br>
to undermine the scientific process would want to emphasize the former 
<br>
reading, which isn't very far from what (as I remember) Kuhn said.  The 
<br>
thing they don't realize is that the prevailing theories can't change until 
<br>
people come to accept that the new formulation of the problem gives a 
<br>
better picture of reality.  If scientists didn't change their minds about 
<br>
what problems matter, Newton couldn't have convinced people that falling 
<br>
apples and cannonballs fall for the same reason that planet move the way 
<br>
they do.  That's not changing standards in the sense that the critics mean.
<br>
<p><p>[The Weinberg quote continues (I've changed the inner quote marks so it's 
<br>
clear that Weinberg is quoting Kuhn.  If I've misinterpreted the 
<br>
punctuation, please let me know.):]
<br>
<em>&gt; [I]n the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chapter Kuhn tentatively attacked the view that science makes progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward objective truths: 'We may, to be more precise, have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relinquish the notion, explicit or implicit, that changes of paradigm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carry scientists and those who learn from them closer and closer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the truth.'  
</em><br>
<p>I'll have to look for the quote and figure out what the context was.  I can 
<br>
easily imagine a context that makes this unobjectionable.  If he says or 
<br>
implies that some paradigm changes are temporarily diverting, that wouldn't 
<br>
be a horrible mistatement if he also meant that in the long run, we do move 
<br>
closer.  I take that to mean something like the current tussle between 
<br>
different interpretations of quantum behavior might all be on the wrong 
<br>
track in some long term sense.  That doesn't imply that we don't currently 
<br>
have a better model than Bohr did.
<br>
<p>[this is Weinberg continuing after the Kuhn quote.]
<br>
<em>&gt; Kuhn's book lately seems to have become read (or at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quoted) as a manifesto for a general attack on the presumed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objectivity of science.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>[This is Lee continuing after the end of Weinberg's words.]
<br>
<em>&gt; I thought S.W. said more;  but in any case, that explains where Mike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was coming from, because what Kuhn is saying, even if he didn't mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to, is that the theories are changing just due to people and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies. 
</em><br>
<p>I object to your phrasing here.  &quot;what Kuhn is saying, even if he didn't 
<br>
mean to.&quot;  I would have said &quot;The way Kuhn's words are being read&quot;.  Lee, I 
<br>
think you are giving in to the deconstructionists techniques.  What Kuhn 
<br>
said and what he meant aren't changed because opponents of science can find 
<br>
evidence of their objections by torturing the text.  As Weinberg's words 
<br>
say &quot;Kuhn's book lately seems to have become read [...] as a manifesto.&quot;  
<br>
That's not the same as what Kuhn said.
<br>
<p>Kuhn certainly talked about scientific progress as a social process.  His 
<br>
major point was to indicate (As Tulloch and Buchanan did for politics) that 
<br>
the people participating in the process have their own agendas and that 
<br>
science only progresses through them.  We can still see (I don't remember 
<br>
to what extent Kuhn talked about this) that Science generally progresses 
<br>
even though it has to wait for the social processes to play out.
