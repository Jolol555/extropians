<p>&nbsp;Increased levels of forkhead box M1B transcription factor in transgenic
<br>
&nbsp;mouse hepatocytes prevent age-related proliferation defects in
<br>
&nbsp;regenerating liver.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Abstract:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forkhead box (Fox) family of transcription factors share homology
<br>
&nbsp;in the winged helix/forkhead DNA-binding domain and play important roles
<br>
&nbsp;in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, longevity, and
<br>
&nbsp;cellular transformation. Forkhead box M1B (FoxM1B) is a ubiquitously
<br>
&nbsp;expressed member of the Fox transcription factor family whose expression
<br>
&nbsp;is restricted to proliferating cells and that mediates hepatocyte entry
<br>
&nbsp;into DNA synthesis and mitosis during liver regeneration. Recent cDNA
<br>
&nbsp;microarray studies indicated that age-related defects in cellular
<br>
&nbsp;proliferation are associated with dimished expression of the FoxM1B
<br>
&nbsp;transciption factor. Here, we show that increased levels of FoxM1B in
<br>
&nbsp;regenerating liver of old transgenic mice restore the sharp peaks in
<br>
&nbsp;hepatocyte DNA replication and mitosis that are the hallmarks of young
<br>
&nbsp;regenerating mouse liver. Restoration of the young regenerating liver
<br>
&nbsp;phenotype is associated with increased expression of numerous cell cycle
<br>
&nbsp;regulatory genes that include cyclin D1, cyclin A2. cyclin F, cyclin B1,
<br>
&nbsp;cyclin B2, Cdc25B, and p55cdc. Cotransfection assays in the human
<br>
&nbsp;hepatoma HepG2 cell line demonstrated that FoxM1B protein stimulated
<br>
&nbsp;expression of both the cyclin B1 and cyclin D1 promoters, suggesting that
<br>
&nbsp;these cyclin genes are a direct FoxM1B transcriptional target. These
<br>
&nbsp;results suggest that FoxM1B controls the transcriptional network of genes
<br>
&nbsp;that are essential for cell division and exit from mitosis. Our results
<br>
&nbsp;indicate that reduced expression of the FoxM1B transcription factor
<br>
&nbsp;contributes to the decline in cellular proliferation observed in the
<br>
&nbsp;aging process.
