<p><em>&gt; Are there sound, scientific, a priori reasons for saying that there are no

</em><br>
<p>Jared Diamond gave an excellent argument as to why we should expect Europeans
<br>
to be genetically less intelligent than Native Americans, many Africans, New
<br>
Guinea highlanders, and aborigines.  For millennia Europeans have been
<br>
farmers, with their survival not terribly limited by intelligence.  The
<br>
primary cause of death was disease, meaning that the primary selection
<br>
pressure was for disease resistance.  
<br>
<p>The other groups mentioned, as hunter-gatherers (or mixed farmers and
<br>
foragers) actually had to think about finding their food: learn about
<br>
countless varieties of plants (witch knowledge in Europe), ditto for the
<br>
animals, along with behavior, breeding and migration patterns, and tracks.
<br>
Stupidity would have a strong correlation with collecting less food, which in
<br>
a small group would be obvious, and would probably lead to having fewer
<br>
children, at least for males.
<br>
<p>Of course, Europeans had the same behavior until only a few millennia ago.
<br>
But with &quot;being ravaged by plague&quot; replacing &quot;need brains to gather food&quot; at a
<br>
fairly intense level, we could expect some decline in European intelligence
<br>
due to random drift.
<br>
<p>The same could be said of many Asian peoples, only even more so, since the
<br>
Chinese for example have been agricultural and plague-ridden for longer than
<br>
northwest Europeans.
<br>
<p>Also leading to the conclusion that my Irish ancestors should have been
<br>
genetically smarter than my Jewish ones, the Mideast invented agriculture
<br>
first.
<br>
<p>The neat thing about science is that it doesn't always give you the answers
<br>
you expect.  Now if we could only test this theory somehow...
