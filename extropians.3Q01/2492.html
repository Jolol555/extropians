<p>
I found Cato's Policy Analysis on &quot;California's Electricity Crisis&quot; [1] to
<br>
be quite informative and very valuable.  My conclusions about the
<br>
causes were slightly different from those of the authors, but they did
<br>
provide important clues about what was going on.  The most important 
<br>
contribution (for me) was to resolve a conundrum that came up earlier on 
<br>
this list.
<br>
<p>My conclusions, after reading the paper are that the primary causes were
<br>
independent of the bad design of the restructured (not &quot;deregulated&quot;)
<br>
California market.  The prime contribution of the restructuring to the
<br>
crisis was to limit the prices paid by consumers, which made them even
<br>
more price insensitive than they were assumed to be.  This had the
<br>
effect of
<br>
ensuring that consumption wouldn't respond to wholesale price increases. 
<br>
The price increases were caused by a variety of factors outside of
<br>
California's control, and would have led only to short term price rises if
<br>
California's consumers had been able to react to rising prices.
<br>
<p><p>Shortly after the crisis became big news, several people on this list
<br>
became concerned about the auction rules used at the ISO. (See the
<br>
discussion rooted at [2].)  We heard reports that one cause for the
<br>
extremely high prices being charged to the utilities was that the ISO's
<br>
rules called for prices to be set every day according to the highest
<br>
clearing price in any of the hourly auctions throughout the day.  [3] At
<br>
the time, I tried to contact the author of a Reason article [4] that
<br>
revealed this tidbit, but were unable to get confirmation.  Some of the 
<br>
apparently authoritative sources we consulted said the price was set 
<br>
according to  daily maximums of hourly auctions, and others said the 
<br>
prices set by the hourly auctions held.   According to the details in 
<br>
this paper and some of its references, it now seems clear to me that the 
<br>
day-ahead Power Exchange was charging by first-price rules, but that 
<br>
choice (which, it is now clear to me, is correct) was undercut by the 
<br>
effect of the ISO's separate market for emergency power.  
<br>
<p>The first price rule smoothes the market.  If the market doesn't pay
<br>
suppliers by first price rules, the suppliers will game the system to try
<br>
to get the same prices.  It's better to pay by first price rules and give
<br>
them incentive to describe their price structure honestly.  Harvey and
<br>
Hogan [5] describe how the difference between the rules on the day-ahead
<br>
Power Exchange and the emergency supplies arranged by the ISO would lead
<br>
suppliers to try to bid the expected clearing price rather than their
<br>
costs of production.  This means that the market structure doesn't really
<br>
affect the averages prices paid over the long run; a badly designed market
<br>
mostly means inefficient bidding, and an inability to forecast.
<br>
<p><p>The report explains that the retail price controls mean that consumers
<br>
were more price insensitive than the politicians believed.  In the short
<br>
term, consumers can't change the kinds of appliances they have, and they
<br>
don't hear about prices until the end of the month, so the argument says
<br>
they can't react to changing prices.  The promised price reductions for
<br>
consumers who reduce their use by 20% or more, combined with the high
<br>
prices charged recently have resulted in more consumers reaching the
<br>
target than anyone expected.  Consumers react to prices after all!  :-)
<br>
<p><p>In the face of the demand insensitivity, there were a couple of unexpected
<br>
hits on the supply of power that moved the market from a relatively
<br>
price-sensitive part of the supply curve to a relatively insensitive
<br>
area. 
<br>
The weather was beneficial (wet in the winter and relatively cool in the
<br>
summer) from the mid-90s through 97, removing any incentive to build
<br>
more. 
<br>
In 98 and 99, the weather returned to normal, reducing reservoir
<br>
excesses. 
<br>
2000 was quite dry and the summer was the 6th hottest in 106 years.  This
<br>
meant that much less of California's power was coming from hydro.  In
<br>
addition, prices of natural gas rose nationally, and there were problems
<br>
with some of the natural gas pipelines coming into the state, reducing
<br>
access to supplies of natural gas, just when it was needed to replace the
<br>
missing hydro.
<br>
<p>All the efficient generators running in uncontrolled smog markets were
<br>
running flat out.  The marginal generators were either old and inefficient
<br>
(prone to more breakdowns than the average) or situated in LA. In LA,
<br>
restrictions on Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions led to a steep price curve
<br>
as additional plants came on line there.  Each plant had to buy emissions
<br>
permits in order to burn gas, reducing the supply of permits, and raising
<br>
the price of the remaining permits.  The price of NOx permits rose from $2
<br>
per pound in 1999 to $40 in 2000.
<br>
<p>If consumers had been price-sensitive, the huge rises in marginal costs 
<br>
would have led to marginal reductions in demand.  Instead, the utilities 
<br>
and the ISO reacted as if filling the demand was worth any price, which 
<br>
of course kept demand steady, and drove prices ever higher.
<br>
<p><p>The weather and pipeline problems were outside the control of the
<br>
architects of the restructuring and any of the actors in the power markets
<br>
last year and this year.  The Cato paper argues that the structure of
<br>
the 
<br>
market and the lack of long term contracts didn't actually contribute.  
<br>
Environmentalists and NIMBY effects weren't the constraining factor in 
<br>
the low number of new plants; even in their absence, the low 
<br>
opportunities for profit through the late 90s would have kept new 
<br>
producers from moving in.  
<br>
<p><p>The one factor (rising prices) that would normally have allowed demand to
<br>
react to supply prices was missing, and that allowed prices to go
<br>
sky-high.  The most important factor in fixing the problem is to remove 
<br>
the price caps.  Moving some customers to real-time prices would help
<br>
the 
<br>
situation.
