From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Atlantic:%20&quot;Coming%20to%20Grips%20with%20Jihad&quot;&In-Reply-To=&lt;002d01c13d75$abb33140$c8c8f418@southmount.com&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; Isn't that taking the analogy too far, and missing out what the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point is? The goal is a new enlightenment (and not just in islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations, preferably also here in the west!), we have to select ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards this goal that fit with reality. Unless the US invades
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghanistan or something similar, dictatorships are obviously out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question. But what about pressuring for democracy? What about giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support to the free press and pro-democratic groups across the middle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; east? What about opening a dialogue with islamic scholars (whose views
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often have far greater impact on culture and policy in their countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than our scholars could ever hope to achieve)? What about removing trade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tariffs against such nations? There are a lot of different options here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I am not questioning the goal. I am questioning--or at least drawing out an
<br>
implication of--Charlie's analogy. Using Japan as an anaology was supposed
<br>
to give us some reason for hoping that we can institute this goal. I am
<br>
merely pointing out that in the case of Japan a military dictatorship was
<br>
necessary. I don't disagree that this is the only means to achieve this
<br>
goal, I do wonder how effective in the short term (say &lt;20 years) more beign
<br>
measures might be. The sorts of measures you described have been
<br>
attempted--with varying degrees of enthusias--with China, inter alia. I
<br>
think there is some room for optimism that such means might eventually be
<br>
effective, but these are long-term projects. Having said this, however, I
<br>
should say that I am not totally against the idea of invading countries for
<br>
precisely this purpose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In effect, I think you are saying that we know best what is best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for them. (If not this only exacerbates the problem). You might even be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; right about this, but still there is the problem of instituting what we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think is best for them. After all, saying that they are ignorant in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; respect is part of what they do not like about the west in the first
</em><br>
place.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Any thoughts and getting from here to there?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Charlie's article was unashamedly universalistic: it claimed it is good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to live in a free, open society where human rights are respected. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an opinion that is seldom heard today, but I think it should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supported. Empirical evidence show that open societies work, become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prosperous, free and fairly safe, and beside this they have a solid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical foundation that doesn't necessarily have to contradict any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion (as well as they are compatible, no, nearly indispensable for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumansm).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In our postmodern culture such universalism is viewed with scepticism:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who am I to declare what is good for others? The realisation that other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultures may have valid points is often extrapolated to the incorrect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea that all expressions of all cultures are equally valid. Even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this ridiculous extreme is not accepted, many think that it is wrong to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not just impose ones own values onto another culture by force, but also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is wrong to impose it - even without deliberation - by exposure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or non-coercive means such as trade. This is the foundation for much of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the resistance in Europe agains &quot;American cultural imperialism&quot; -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Starbucks and Euro-Disney are seen by some intellectuals as an act of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural &quot;war&quot; (my quotation marks, not theirs).
</em><br>
<p>I of course agree. Sometimes the mistake is made that since we believe that
<br>
the individual ought to have the right to live according to his or her
<br>
conception of human flourishing that it follows that at the state level we
<br>
should allow other countries to follow their conception of what human
<br>
flourishing consists in. Clearly the latter does not follow from the former.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But cultures have always interacted. Ideas spread, customs mix and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structures are challenged. We should be happy about the creolization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that have brought forth greek philosophy, hellenism, indian art, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; netherlands, the US and rock music. Trying to keep a culture static and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; untainted by outside influences is equivalent to killing it by freezing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We should not try to impose our values with force on other cultures -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that never works - but we should show them the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas/things/institutions we have achived, why they work, how they work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and invite them to do better. The Japanese understood this long before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WW II - it might have taken them a gunboat to start the process simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by showing them what they had missed, but soon it had its own momentum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when they realized that they could learn and make something good out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what they learned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
The Japanese certainly knew about western industry well before WW II,
<br>
indeed, this was apparent to the world after 1904. It sounds like a
<br>
revisionist history to say that the had adopted much of the political/moral
<br>
values of the Enlightenment before the end of WW II. Thus, I think that the
<br>
Japanese are an excellent model of how imposing our values with force can be
<br>
done successfully. After all, the Japanese were not trusted with any
<br>
military force to speak of for a generation, this task being left to the
<br>
U.S. The lesson we should draw from Japan's case is that we need to deal a
<br>
crushing military blow to a country and then dominate them military for a
<br>
generation while the Enlightenment values have a chance to take root. As
<br>
brutal as this sounds, I must say I am not sure that Afghanistan would not
<br>
be better off in both the long and short term if this model was implimented
<br>
there. Mark
