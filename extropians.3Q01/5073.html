<br>
<p>&lt; The project studied the genes of 137 100-year-olds, and those of their
<br>
brothers and sisters aged between 91 and 109, to look for genes they had in
<br>
common. The search identified a section of &quot;chromosome four&quot; that appeared
<br>
to be the same in all the old people. It is believed to contain up to 10
<br>
crucial disease-fighting genes. 
<br>
<p>The results of the research, which was led by Thomas Perls, a geriatrician,
<br>
and Lou Kunkel, a geneticist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, is
<br>
being published by the National Academy of Sciences in America tomorrow. 
<br>
<p>It derived from research on fruit flies which has shown that there are only
<br>
a few genes that need to be altered to increase lifespan markedly. The team
<br>
correctly assumed that a painstaking comparison of human gene profiles
<br>
would lead to the discovery of similar factors in humans. &gt;
<br>
<p>etc
