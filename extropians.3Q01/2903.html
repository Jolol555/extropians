It doesn't work in the Bay area at all. I found that out earlier this year.
<br>
But I found that I talked almost exclusively to Irish, English, Antipodeans
<br>
or South Africans. Went to US and hardly spoke to any Americans. That was a
<br>
bit wierd.

<p><em>&gt; &gt; (Then I started to notice what an English accent does to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Texans, after which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I stopped paying attention to other things. I swear, it's like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clubbing baby
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seals, only you can't stop).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would you explain more about that?  I think that I may know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you are talking about, but I'm not sure.
</em><br>
<p>One day after landing: in Wendy's, cute guy starts chatting me up in the
<br>
queue after hearing me talk (&quot;oh my god, you're *english*). Clubbing ensues.
<br>
<p>Three days after landing: entering a pool hall (of that peculiar type found
<br>
in Texas where the waitresses are selected for appearance and wear those
<br>
oddball uniforms); the greeter shakes my hand and won't let go until I
<br>
remind her that she's still holding on.
<br>
<p>Four days after landing: I'm starting to wonder if accents have potential
<br>
military applications. The underlying reasons for the English having managed
<br>
to conquer half the known world are becoming apparent to me.
<br>
<p>.
<br>
.
<br>
.
<br>
<p>Two weeks after landing: the Brazilian girls. Don't ask. Apparently it works
<br>
on them too. Probably just as well the English never got to Brazil.
<br>
<p>etc, for an incident every couple of days for five years or so.
<br>
<p>It doesn't seem to work so well in the Bay Area, which is a good thing, I'm
<br>
coming to think. I guess I'm getting to that stage in life where the process
<br>
of eyes glazing over in some cute young thing I've just met provokes
<br>
exasperation. It's kinda hard to follow up &quot;like, oh my god, you're
<br>
*english*&quot; with a conversation about something (anything! please!) important
<br>
or meaningful.
