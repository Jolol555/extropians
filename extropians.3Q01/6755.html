</em><br>
<p>For many years the US held an arms embargo against Israel, leaving
<br>
Israel to buy Mirage and Mig fighters from France and the USSR, as well
<br>
as european and south african armor and artillery. It developed its own
<br>
small arms industry, building the various models of Uzi derived from a
<br>
Czech design, itself derivative of a Nazi machine gun (interesting
<br>
huh?). IAI also got into the fighter plane industry, developing it's
<br>
Kfir fighter planes based on Mig and Mirage technologies (both of which
<br>
are also direct descendants of the Messerschmitt 262 and the Heinkel
<br>
Volksjager jet fighters, the core of their jet engines is nearly
<br>
indistinguisable from those of the early Kfir fighters). 
<br>
<p>It was not until the late 60's/early 70's that we started selling planes
<br>
to Israel, F-4 Phantoms, F-5 Freedom Fighters, and I believe A-4
<br>
Skyhawks, and not in significant quantities until the late 70's, when we
<br>
equipped them with enough F-15's and F-16's to allow them to chalk up a
<br>
50 to 1 kill ratio in the air battles over the Bekaa Valley with Syria
<br>
during the Lebanon War. 
<br>
<p>We had also sold F-5's and A-4's to Jordan, Egypt, Kuwait, and several
<br>
other moderate arab states as soviet influence started waning over the
<br>
region in the 70's. While there is a complaint that we wouldn't sell
<br>
F-15's to, say, Saudi Arabia for a while, we did sell them to Egypt, and
<br>
keep in mind that tactically, an F-15 can be beaten by 2.5 F-5's (which
<br>
are significantly cheaper planes).
<br>
<p>In the mid 80's the Israelis then invested in US attack helicopters and
<br>
attempted to launch its own version of the F-16, a delta winged beauty
<br>
with a wholly new avionics and radar suite that was in excess of
<br>
anything the US had envisioned for its own Falcons. There was a big
<br>
fight with democrats in congress over this, and the program died out (as
<br>
did a similar program with Japan several years later).
