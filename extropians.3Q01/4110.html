</em><br>
<p>I can't speak for others, but here's the reason I care about the questions:
<br>
If blacks DON'T commit more crimes (for any given number of persons) than
<br>
whites, then our legal system discriminates against them, because more
<br>
blacks than whites are arrested, convicted, imprisoned, and executed.
<br>
<p>Although I'm not currently a member of a group that's discriminated against
<br>
by the criminal justice system, my concern is not merely altruistic. If our
<br>
system is set up to discriminate against certain categories of people,
<br>
there's no guarantee I myself won't someday BE a member of such an
<br>
unfortunate group.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevance to Extropians?
</em><br>
<p>Extropians anticipate living beyond the traditionally acceptable human
<br>
lifespan. In addition, some Extropians have, or at some point in the future
<br>
will have, undergone some form of bio-suspension. Although I tend to be an
<br>
optimist, I'm also a realist, and at the moment I think there's some greater
<br>
than zero probability that the human species is in for some traditional
<br>
rough times in the not so distant future. By traditional rough times I mean
<br>
economic depressions, shortages of food and water, shortages of medications,
<br>
microbial plagues. That sort of thing. In rough times it will be all too
<br>
tempting for people to decide that certain groups should be discriminated
<br>
against. It's not hard to imagine politicians pulling the plug on life
<br>
support systems for suspended people or making laws that people older than
<br>
85 are not entitled to medical care.
<br>
<p>This could happen anyhow, of course. But to the extent that the legal system
<br>
deals with people as individuals rather than as members of groups, it's less
<br>
likely to happen. Racism is one form of judging people as members of groups
<br>
rather than as individuals. Therefore, I'd like to acknowledge and
<br>
discourage racism.
