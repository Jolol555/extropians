Subject: Fw: Chomsky initial reaction
<br>
<p>from email from ZNet (Z Magazine): www.zmag.org
<br>
<p>including a note from Noam Chomsky replying to an email query:
<br>
<p>Chomsky note...
<br>
<p>Just got your message [from MA-ZMag]. Quick reaction.
<br>
<p>Today's attacks were major atrocities. In terms of number of victims
<br>
they do not reach the level of many others, for example, Clinton's
<br>
bombing of the Sudan with no credible pretext, destroying half its
<br>
pharmaceutical supplies and probably killing tens of thousands of people
<br>
(no one knows, because the US blocked an inquiry at the UN and no one
<br>
cares to pursue it). Not to speak of much worse cases, which easily come
<br>
to mind. But that this was a horrendous crime is not in doubt. The
<br>
primary victims, as usual, were working people: janitors, secretaries,
<br>
firemen, etc. It is likely to prove to be a crushing blow to
<br>
Palestinians and other poor and oppressed people. It is also likely to
<br>
lead to harsh security controls, with many possible ramifications for
<br>
undermining civil liberties and internal freedom.
<br>
<p>The events reveal, dramatically, the foolishness of ideas about &quot;missile
<br>
defense.&quot; As has been obvious all along, and pointed out repeatedly by
<br>
strategic analysts, if anyone wants to cause immense damage in the US,
<br>
including weapons of mass destruction, they are highly unlikely to
<br>
launch a missile attack, thus guaranteeing their immediate destruction.
<br>
There are innumerable easier ways that are basically unstoppable. But
<br>
today's events will, nonetheless, be used to increase the pressure to
<br>
develop these systems and put them into place. &quot;Defense&quot; is a thin cover
<br>
for plans for militarization of space, and with good PR, even the
<br>
flimsiest arguments will carry some weight among a frightened public.
<br>
In short, the crime is a gift to the hard jingoist right, those who hope
<br>
to use force to control their domains. That is even putting aside the
<br>
likely US actions, and what they will trigger -- possibly more attacks
<br>
like this one, or worse. The prospects ahead are even more ominous than
<br>
they appeared to be before the latest atrocities.
<br>
