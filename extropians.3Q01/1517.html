<p>My point was not that it is bad -- just that it happens. Power concentrates 
<br>
in fewer hands, and there is real danger in that.
<br>

</em><br>
<p>Well... it is not really a waste of resources if it protects us and the 
<br>
economy from the wastefulness and retarding effects of monopoly.
<br>
<p>Do you have a problem with laws that stop people shoplifting? That is a 
<br>
common way that people tend to act. Is it wasteful to spend effort on 
<br>
preventing theft?  :-)
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;I should emphasise that the only yardstick that I care about is the rate of

<em>&gt;technological advancement; a vigorous corporate environment in which

<em>&gt;except trying to compete with the incumbents -- this stops things from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advancing. Darwinism with healthy mutators, but regulation cuts down the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mutation rate.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that rate of technological advancement is one of the most important 
<br>
things... possibly *the* most important challenge.
<br>
<p>I just worry that unqualified enthusiasm for partial solutions could lead 
<br>
us to burn our bridges so that it becomes difficult or even impossible to 
<br>
get back a truly diverse marketplace.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;All monopolies are unstable;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In the long run, I agree with you. What I think worries most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; incredible damage to the people and the economy that they can wreak along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the way. Sure, they have to fall eventually, but they could last hundreds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of years... do you think the next generation should have to deal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with that legacy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What damage can a monopoly do if there's no regulation that prevents small
</em><br>
<em>&gt;competitors from arising at a fairly rapid rate? Monopolies spur the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;development of other companies and new technologies, because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;demonstrate the existance of a market.
</em><br>
<p>The whole point of monopolies is that they will do anything to retain their 
<br>
monopoly. Abolishing government and its ability to break up monopolies 
<br>
won't help. Monopolies happily trade at a loss for long periods in order to 
<br>
destroy small competitors. Monopolies use blackmail to stop other retailers 
<br>
from stocking the competing product.... and so on. The tiny barrier posed 
<br>
by regulations is nothing even compared to the investment capital required 
<br>
for production equipment, distribution channels, etc.
<br>
<p>I can't help feeling you have a bit of a blind spot here.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;  Sooner or later one of the newcomers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will take down the giant, and I think your timescale of centuries is way out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of proportion. Companies don't last much beyond decades in their chosen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;market even with all the help of a friendly government to keep the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;competition down.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that they are unlikely to last forever, and my guess may be way 
<br>
out, but it might not either. Neither of us can say. But it is a truly 
<br>
dangerous threat. It is no use saying that abolishing the governmental 
<br>
controls will make it all right, because you can not know that. You have to 
<br>
admit that governmental subversion is not the only way monopolies control 
<br>
their marketplace. Nobody knows how difficult it will be to get rid of them 
<br>
after the only other group powerful enough to break them up is eliminated.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;The damage that a monopoly causes when there is regulation to prevent new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;companies arising in their space is to retard and slow down development
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rates.
</em><br>
<p>True, but that is only one of the ways that monopolies hurt the economy, 
<br>
and the other ways happen regardless of whether there is a government or not.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; ...open-source...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My take on open source is more of an efficiency one: it's good because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technology doesn't end up lost in copyright when companies die, because it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spurs growth by making use of otherwise idle resources, because bugs are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shallow. And a million other reasons. Everything except documentation. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When the open source movement can figure a way to make documentation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happen well and happen early, without the intervention of a company, it'll 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conquer the world.
</em><br>
<p>I gotta agree with all that.  :-)
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;People will always abuse power (for any definition of the word 'abuse').
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They will also always seek to accumulate it. You cannot prevent this from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happening, so why try? It would be principled, but a waste of resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better devoted to other causes that would have more beneficial effects.
</em><br>
<p>You will always catch diseases, why bother trying to avoid them?
<br>
People will always die in car accidents, so what is the point of driving on 
<br>
the correct side of the road?
<br>
I can't believe you are saying this Reason!
<br>
<p>There *are* ways to mitigate this tendency to concentrate power. We already 
<br>
use some of them... some societies more successfully than others.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;Again, I think that this is a consequence of our inability to practice a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decent form of government. This leads to an inability to practice more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a hobbled, protectionist form of capitalism. Now if we had a libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;participatory democracy of the form described in Enders Game (to save myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some time typing here, damn I'm lazy), or at least some form of government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in which we did away with career politicians in favor of people who actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know something about each issue that needs addressing....
</em><br>
<p>Certainly, I am the first to agree that the government needs a shitload of 
<br>
improving. I just worry about this baby-bathwater thing.
<br>
<p>Hmmm... Enders Game... book? Orson Scott Card? I'll get it if you think it 
<br>
is a good'un. Even though I have plenty of fiction reading at the moment. 
<br>
Just bought the 4th Harry Potter book, all 600 pages of it. Delightful 
<br>
series that I heartily recommend. :-)
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;But that's a whole other thread to avoid getting into.
</em><br>
<p>Heheheh  :-)
<br>
<p>Best wishes,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
