<p><em>&gt; I wish the store managers who stayed up nights thinking about how they could

<em>&gt; I wish the &quot;immense concentration of knowledge [taking] place in the minds
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; stores&quot; would also develop some incentive to improve the quality of people's
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; stores.
</em><br>
<p>Well, as we say, &quot;wishes don't make horses&quot;.  What possible incentive
<br>
would anyone have to lie awake at night thinking of the best way to
<br>
treat farmworkers?   Now, yes, it's easy to imagine &quot;a man on horseback&quot;
<br>
as a recent poster put it, or a &quot;Stalin&quot; whose heart would be in the
<br>
right place; but over and over we learn what happens when that approach
<br>
is tried.
<br>
<p>I think that what is happening, Olga, is that you divine *your own*
<br>
motivations, and find them quite pure.  I agree.  I am certain that
<br>
you really do have the best interests of the farm workers in mind.
<br>
But you don't lie awake thinking of it at night.  Instead, just like
<br>
the rest of us, you lie awake thinking of your own problems, and it
<br>
is a horrible mistake to think that a great leader will do any
<br>
differently.  So all of his wonderful speeches about &quot;benefitting
<br>
the people&quot; are mainly power ploys to defeat his adversaries, gain
<br>
power from the (ignorant) crowds, and ultimately work towards his
<br>
own best interests.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While supermarket customers' &quot;body language, their shopping patterns, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of all, their buying habits&quot; may indeed be worthy of a specialized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; field of study, I'm afraid farmworkers' problems are all pretty much the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134331325_migrantkids19m.htm">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134331325_migrantkids19m.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p>Yes, their problems *are* just the same.  And your problems remain yours,
<br>
and my problems remain mine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nowhere is the need for children's programs more pressing than in this tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; town, population 2,609, where 96 percent of children live in poverty.
</em><br>
<p>Here is the fatal urge.  You read about some unfortunate situation such as this,
<br>
and you want to DO SOMETHING.  (Of course, it's really none of your business;
<br>
you actually spend most of your time worrying about your own *local* problems.)
<br>
Hence even if it means for a great leader, or the government, to TAKE IMMEDIATE
<br>
ACTION BY SEIZING ALL ASSETS OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE THAN THEY NEED, you
<br>
have an immediate sympathy for something, so long as it solves the problem.
<br>
<p>Look at the words in that paragraph I snipped:  the &quot;need for children's programs&quot;,
<br>
&quot;96 percent of the children live in poverty&quot;.
<br>
<p>Well, all sorts of people everywhere in the world and all throughout history have
<br>
**needs**.  We must not focus on the so-called causes of poverty, but rather focus
<br>
on how *anyone* ever escaped poverty.  To find out how wealth is created in the
<br>
first place, one must start with Adam Smith, or any thinker who really tries to
<br>
get at root causes.  Wealth was *never* created by taxing one sort of people and
<br>
benevolently bestowing it on those who have *needs* by means of &quot;programs&quot;.
