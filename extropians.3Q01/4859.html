<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Pancreatic cancer preventable?
<br>
<p>Cancer of the pancreas is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, with less
<br>
than five percent of those diagnosed surviving beyond five years.  The
<br>
disease is aggressive and difficult to treat because of its inaccessible
<br>
location and its closeness to other organs.  The August 18 2001 issue of
<br>
Journal of the American Medical Association published an article with an
<br>
accompanying editorial on the growing evidence that pancreatic cancer may be
<br>
a preventable disease for many individuals.  The researchers examined data
<br>
from 46,648 men who participated in the Health Professionals Follow Up Study
<br>
begun in 1986, and 117,041 women who were participants in the Nurses' Health
<br>
Study, initiated in 1976.  Subjects completed a questionnaire concerning
<br>
their health habits at the onset of the study and every two years for the
<br>
remainder of the ten to twenty year follow up.  Deaths were reported by
<br>
family members.
<br>
<p>During follow up there were 350 diagnoses of pancreatic cancer.  The data
<br>
showed a positive correlation between body mass index and the risk of cancer
<br>
of the pancreas. Individuals body mass index of greater than 30 kilograms
<br>
per square meter had greater pancreatic cancer risk than those with a body
<br>
mass index of 25 kilograms per square meter.   A positive association was
<br>
also observed between height and pancreatic cancer diagnosis.  Moderate
<br>
exercise, consisting of approximately one and one half hours of walking per
<br>
week, was associated with a 50% reduction in pancreatic cancer risk in both
<br>
men and women.  The inverse association between exercise and pancreatic risk
<br>
was more pronounced in those who were overweight.
<br>
<p>The researchers explained these results by noting that a high body mass
<br>
index indicative of being overweight or obese is associated with an
<br>
increased risk of hyperinsulinemia and diabetes.  Elevated insulin levels
<br>
have been shown to increase local blood flow and cell divison within the
<br>
pancreas.  Excessive insulin may also cause increased exposure to free
<br>
insulin-like growth factor 1, shown to promote growth in human pancreatic
<br>
cancer cell lines.  Exercise, by improving glucose tolerance and insulin
<br>
clearance rates, can reverse some of this risk.  An alternative explanation
<br>
for the link between obesity and pancreatic cancer rests on the fact that
<br>
the increased formation of DNA mutations found in pancreatic cancer patients
<br>
are also found in individuals who have a higher body mass index, due to
<br>
increased lipid peroxidation.
<br>
<p>As cigarette smoking has heretofore been the only well established risk
<br>
factor for this deadly disease, these findings are important .  Although
<br>
height is an uncontrollable risk factor, improving exercise levels and
<br>
maintaining a healthy weight are measures we can all take to help prevent
<br>
this and other lethal diseases.
<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Pancreatic cancer
<br>
<p>A review of epidemiological evidence on the relationship between nutrition
<br>
and pancreatic cancer found that, overall, fairly consistent patterns of
<br>
positive associations with the intake of meat, carbohydrates, and dietary
<br>
cholesterol have been observed. Consistent inverse relationships with fruit
<br>
and vegetable intakes and, in particular, with fiber and vitamin C, have
<br>
also been noted. (Ghadirian, Thouez et al. 1991; Ji, Chow et al. 1995; Howe
<br>
and Burch 1996)
<br>
<p>An article translated from the Japanese journal Gan No Rinsho compared 71
<br>
patients with pancreatic cancer to 142 community-based controls. They found
<br>
significantly decreased risks were associated with consumption of raw
<br>
vegetables and green tea. The risk increased significantly with consumption
<br>
of the fat of meat, boiled fish, coffee, black tea and alcoholic beverages.
<br>
(Goto, Masuoka et al. 1990)
<br>
<p>An article published in the American journal Epidemiology described a cohort
<br>
study of 27,101 healthy male smokers aged 50 to 69 years. 157 of them
<br>
developed pancreatic cancer during the 13 years of follow-up from 1985 to
<br>
1997. The adjusted hazards ratio comparing the highest with the lowest
<br>
quintile of dietary folate intake was 0.52 (95% confidence interval: 0.31,
<br>
0.87; p-trend = 0.05). Dietary methionine, alcohol intake, and smoking
<br>
history did not modify this relation. Consistent with prior studies, this
<br>
study shows that cigarette smoking was associated with an increased risk.
<br>
The authors conclude that these results support the hypothesis that dietary
<br>
folate intake is inversely associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer and
<br>
confirm the risk associated with greater cigarette smoking.
<br>
(Stolzenberg-Solomon, Pietinen et al. 2001)
<br>
<p>A basic protocol for pancreatic cancer might include the following:
<br>
Spes
<br>
Pancreatic enzymes
<br>
Green tea
<br>
Borage and/or fish oil
<br>
Genistein
<br>
Curcumin (turmeric) and Milk thistle
<br>
Quercetin
<br>
A high-quality multiple that includes antioxidants, selenium, beta-carotene,
<br>
and vitamins E and D
<br>
Perillyl alcohol should be carefully considered

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Folic acid and vitamin B12 capsules
<br>
<p>Folic acid has the following health benefits:
<br>
<p>Helps protect the chromosomes against genetic damage
<br>
<p>Can prevent atherosclerosis caused by excess homocysteine
<br>
<p>Has been shown in high doses to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease
<br>
<p>Is needed for the utilization of sugar and amino acids
<br>
<p>May prevent some forms of cancer
<br>
<p>Promotes healthier skin
<br>
<p>Helps protect against intestinal parasites and food poisoning
<br>
<p>The United States RDA of 400 mcg is needed for minimal health, but recently
<br>
it has been established that folic acid can prevent spina bifida, and women
<br>
of child bearing age should have more than RDA amounts in their diet.

<p>Super Curcumin with Bioperine
<br>
<p>Curcumin is a potent antioxidant extract from the spice turmeric that has a
<br>
wide range of health benefits with specific antiviral, anti-inflammatory,
<br>
anticancer and cholesterol-lowering effects. Cancer researchers are
<br>
developing agents that induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) as potent
<br>
anticancer drugs. In common with many of the nutrients in the Cancer
<br>
Treatment Protocol such as selenium, vitamin A, green tea and vitamin D3,
<br>
curcumin induces cancer cell apoptosis.
<br>
<p>In a wide range of cancer cells, curcumin has been shown to induce cell
<br>
shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation, and to block
<br>
cellular signal transduction. All of these are characteristic of
<br>
apoptosis-inducing agents according to an article published in the journal
<br>
Nutrition and Cancer (USA) (26/1/1996).
<br>
<p>Curcumin provides broad-spectrum effects throughout the body. In addition to
<br>
being a potent antioxidant, curcumin suppresses the enzyme COX-2.
<br>
Overexpression of COX-2 is related to the development of certain cancers and
<br>
chronic inflammatory diseases. By suppressing COX-2 curcumin is thought to
<br>
help prevent the development of colon cancer and alleviate arthritic
<br>
conditions. Curcumin also inhibits abnormal platelet aggregation that can
<br>
lead to a heart attack or stroke.

<p>LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE AUGUST 2001
<br>
An innovative approach to cancer therapy:  One doctor's perspective
<br>
<p>In this era of fast approaching changes in cancer treatment, an alternative
<br>
approach is gaining serious mainstream recognition. Developed by New York
<br>
City immunologist, Nicholas Gonzalez, MD, it focuses on the use of
<br>
biochemical individuality and the incorporation of pancreatic enzymes,
<br>
nutrition, detoxification and autonomic nervous system balance.
<br>
<p>As a result of successful findings in a 1993 National Cancer Institute pilot
<br>
program of his work, Gonzalez gained approval of a major $1.4 million dollar
<br>
grant from the National Institutes of Health. This large-scale five year
<br>
National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health program is being
<br>
conducted under the Department of Oncology and the Department of Surgical
<br>
Oncology at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. It chief
<br>
investigator is John Cabot, M.D., Chief of Surgical Oncology at Columbia.
<br>
This study will compare the effectiveness of the Gonzalez nutritional
<br>
approach in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma).
<br>
<p>Currently they are enrolling 72 to 90 patients, half of who will receive
<br>
chemotherapy with the drug gemcitabine, and half of whom will be treated
<br>
with the nutritional treatment program.  Readers who are interested in
<br>
obtaining further information regarding this study should contact Dr. John
<br>
Chabot or Michele Gabay, RN at (212) 305-9467 or go to www.dr-gonzalez.com
<br>
to learn more about Dr. Gonzalez and his practice.
