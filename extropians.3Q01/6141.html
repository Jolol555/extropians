Mike again we agree. That would not be a moral or political decision I would
<br>
want to have to make in a few mts.
<br>
<p>Again I have questions. American pilots at least used to be trained in air
<br>
maneuvers to force another plane to change direction, land etc. 
<br>
Basically a combination of playing chicken and drafting the other plane to
<br>
deny air the engines as well as deny lift ability. Have we given up this
<br>
class of pilot training?
<br>
<p>If so I think better pilot training is now called for.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;According to the White House and the Pentagon much earlier today, that

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Camp David is not a generally unpopulated area, and I think that given
