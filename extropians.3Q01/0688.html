</em><br>
<p>THere are various processes that could have placebo effects. I prefer to
<br>
look at 'placebo' as a scientists explaination for something he has not,
<br>
or is unwilling to, vigorously examine due to the narrow confines of
<br>
his/her experimental hypothesis, while other scientists will ascribe
<br>
what others would call a placebo effect to some causal agent without
<br>
proving any actual linkage mechanism beyond a synchronicity of events. A
<br>
case in point is one recently released which purports to show that low
<br>
level radiation from nuclear plants causes significant rates of fetal
<br>
congenital defects, by looking at a population local to a nuke plant
<br>
during its start up and shut down. They claim this 'low level radiation'
<br>
is the culprit, despite there being other more significant sources of
<br>
radiation, including the sun, radon in their homes, and the radioactive
<br>
fly ash in the concrete of the buildings they live and work in. They
<br>
also fail to consider that the rise in fetal defects could easily be
<br>
explained as a stress related phenomenon of media hype inducing
<br>
excessive paranoia in pregnant mothers. Another thing they fail to do in
<br>
the study is to look for similar rises and falls in fetal congenital
<br>
defects in populations around coal plants, since it is a proven fact
<br>
that the average coal plant puts out more radiation in its fly ash than
<br>
the entire commercial nuke industry does.
<br>
<p>In this instance, the likely actual culprit according to Occams Razor,
<br>
is stress related to media propaganda. Since stress is a known
<br>
contributor to cancer, it follows that it would also be a contributor to
<br>
developmental problems in fetuses.
