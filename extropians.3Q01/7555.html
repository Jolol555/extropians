<em>&gt; Jeff, I suspect that there would be a lot of infection with the &quot;minor&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as EBV, CMV etc that on a large scale would not be good. Also major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virus or other disease vectors (BSV,HIV and who knows what else)could be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spread.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is enough problems with whole blood products as it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One question I had was how long the immunity lasts. If you were vaccinated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infant and then re-vaccinated as a young adult and the second did not take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (no second scar) does that mean you had adequate protection from smallpox at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time of the second vaccination? And does that provide any indication of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protection as an adult?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Best Wishes
</em><br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thats a good question, Is the reaction to the vaccination and the 
<br>
resultant scar an indicator of the effectiveness of the vaccination ?. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was vaccinated I showed no reaction other than a small white 
<br>
lump around the injection sight. This went down within an hour and left no 
<br>
scar. Whereas everybody else without execption had a violent skin reaction 
<br>
leaving a scar around 3/4 inch in diameter.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean that I had a &quot;duff&quot; vaccination or could it be that for 
<br>
some reason I was already immune, or just a freak who immune system reacts 
<br>
differently ?.
<br>
