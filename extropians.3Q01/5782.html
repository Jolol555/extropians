<em>&gt; I haven't a clue what this story has to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with extropianism, but my neighbors think Im some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of kook, outside with a flashlight watching ants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walk up and down my garbage can.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Here's what it has to do with extropianism: I spent the last five hours
<br>
fighting a forty acre wildland fire between Manton and Shingletown. I did two
<br>
hose lays and watched while someone operated the pump. When I got back to my
<br>
car, the battery was too low to crank the engine, and I had to call the
<br>
station to get someone to come out and jump start it. While we're watching
<br>
ants and fighting fires (and Brian Phillips is going on about his Dinner with
<br>
Aztlan or whatever), Kurzweil, Hawking, and Minsky are trying to decide
<br>
whether to build intelligent robots or cyborgs to take our places. Who cares
<br>
what the neighbors think...We're all bozos on this bus. If extropy could talk,
<br>
it would whisper in song like a morning breeze. If extropy could touch it
<br>
would splash sweet lotion on my aching muscles, and the stream of it would
<br>
soothe, refresh and delight. If extropy could see it would observe immense and
<br>
timeless reveries of moonlit silence within each heartbeat, sturdy as earth
<br>
and sea, and delicate as starlight reflected in a child's eyes. September's
<br>
moon remembers shadows of the would-be-nows in feather-years of stillness and
<br>
dismay. September's moon knows the stillness of the will-be-thens in vaulted
<br>
unknown spaces of the bending land. September's moon knows the suchness of
<br>
stretching fibers in a body singing the quiet ecstasy of its tired endless
<br>
fullness. OK, I lied. It hasn't anything to do with extropianism, but maybe
<br>
Minsky can work his sphexish emotion machine with it somehow. Don't tell the
<br>
neighbors. &gt;yawn&lt;
