<br>
<p>Blood pressure reduction prevents second events even in nonhypertensive
<br>
stroke survivors
<br>
<p>In what has been called a landmark study published in the September 29 2001
<br>
issue of the Lancet, 6,105 stroke patients from Europe, Australia and Asia
<br>
experienced reductions of 25% to 50% in the risk of a second cardiovascular
<br>
event when given blood pressure lowering drugs.  The study, known as the
<br>
Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study or &quot;PROGRESS&quot;, tested
<br>
the ability of the ACE inhibitor drug perindropril combined with the
<br>
diuretic indapamide to prevent a second stroke or heart attack in this high
<br>
risk population.  While aspirin has demonstrated success in preventing
<br>
second coronary events, it cannot be used by hemorrhagic stroke survivors.
<br>
Hemorrhagic stroke is the type of stroke that occurs when a blood vessel in
<br>
the vein ruptures and bleeds.  In the present study, hemorrhagic stroke
<br>
patients experienced three-quarters the risk of stroke than controls.
<br>
<p>Although high blood pressure is a strong risk factor factor for stroke, over
<br>
two-thirds of strokes occur in people who are not hypertensive.  One out of
<br>
six stroke surivors suffer from another stroke or a heart attack within five
<br>
years of the intial event.
<br>
<p>Participants from 172 Asian, Australian and European centers were randomnly
<br>
assigned perindorpil and indapamide or a placebo and followed up for four
<br>
years.  Both hypertensive and nonhypertensive individuals receiving the drug
<br>
combination experienced a reduction in blood pressure. Ten percent of those
<br>
receiving the drugs experienced a stroke during follow-up compared to 14% of
<br>
the placebo group.  Major vascular events were also reduced.  One in every
<br>
eleven participants were able to avoid death or a major cardiovascular event
<br>
over the course of the study.
<br>
<p>&quot;It was thought that blood pressure lowering drugs were only useful for
<br>
patients with high blood pressure, but we have shown that perindopril and
<br>
indapamide have beneficial effects, not only for those with high blood
<br>
pressure, but also for the much larger number of stroke patients with normal
<br>
blood pressure,&quot; commented study chairman, Professor John Chalmers of the
<br>
University of Sydney.
<br>
<p>Chief investigator Dr Stephen McMahon summarized, &quot;The results provide clear
<br>
evidence of major health gains for these high risk patients. If the findings
<br>
are applied widely, many millions of stroke sufferers worldwide would be
<br>
spared unnecessary suffering . . . There is a strong case for making this
<br>
treatment available to most stroke patients, irrespective of their age and
<br>
blood pressure and irrespective of the other treatments they may be
<br>
receiving. The benefits are unusually large and occur in a wide range of
<br>
patients. There were very few side-effects.&quot;
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
<p>The &quot;What's Hot&quot; feature of Life Extension's website features the latest
<br>
news in the fields of health and medicine.  New items are posted each
<br>
Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
<br>
<p>Antioxidant vitamins prevent progression of hypertension in spontaneously
<br>
hypertensive rats
<br>
<p>In a study published in Hypertension: Journal of the American Heart
<br>
Association, researchers from the University of Montreal and Sungkyunkwan
<br>
University in Seoul, Korea, demonstrated the ability of vitamins C and E to
<br>
prevent the progression of hypertension in rats given a 4% sodium chloride
<br>
diet. High sodium diets are notorious for raising blood pressure, and salt
<br>
reduction is a frequent recommendation given by physicians to their
<br>
hypertensive patients.
<br>
<p>Stroke-prone spontaneous hypertensive rats were divided into groups who
<br>
received diets containing 1000 mg ascorbic acid per day, 1000 international
<br>
units vitamin E per day or a diet supplemented with neither vitamin. The
<br>
rats were studied for six weeks and had their blood pressure measured
<br>
weekly. At twenty-two weeks of age the animals were euthanized and blood
<br>
samples drawn. Small arteries were examined for the ability to relax, and
<br>
thoracic aortas were examined for the presence of the pro-oxidant superoxide
<br>
and the antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD).
<br>
<p>While hypertension progressed in the animals receiving the nonsupplemented
<br>
high sodium diet, the condition only increased marginally in the animals
<br>
receiving vitamin C or E, while body weights of all groups did not differ.
<br>
The media to lumen ratio and media thickness of the arteries of the
<br>
supplemented rats were significantly lower than that of controls. Vitamins C
<br>
and E increased the ability of the arteries to relax, indicating improved
<br>
endothelial function. They also lowered superoxide activity by decreasing
<br>
the activity of NADPH oxidase, and increasing that of SOD in the vasculature
<br>
of the animals studied.

<p><p>Antioxidants may be treatment of choice for hypertension
<br>
<p>The September 2001 issue of International Kidney published an article in
<br>
which the hypothesis was submitted that severe regional hypertension may be
<br>
due to inactivation of nitric oxide by a type of free radical known as
<br>
reactive oxygen species. Nitric oxide is a substance produced in the body
<br>
which aids in the relaxation of the blood vessels, helping to maintain
<br>
normal blood pressure. The researchers acted on the finding that in rats
<br>
with a severe narrowing of the aorta above the renal arteries, nitric oxide
<br>
synthase is upregulated in the heart, chest and brain, which may be caused
<br>
by nitric oxide inactivation by free radicals.
<br>
<p>The researchers in this study banded the aortas of rats above the renal
<br>
artery to mimic a condition found in humans in which elevated blood pressure
<br>
exists in the vasculature above a narrowed site. Another group of rats were
<br>
sham-operated as controls. Nitrotyrosine, a marker of nitric oxide
<br>
interaction with reactive oxygen species, and intra-arterial pressure were
<br>
measured after three weeks. The banded rats experienced a significant rise
<br>
in arterial pressure as well as increases in nitrotyrosine in the aorta
<br>
above the band as well as in the heart and brain compared to controls. In
<br>
the aorta segment below the bands where there was no change in blood
<br>
pressure, nitrotyrosine levels remained the same.

<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Hypertension
<br>
<p>A startling statistic in the May 4, 1999, edition of The New York Times
<br>
revealed that only 18% of people with high blood pressure (hypertension) are
<br>
successfully treated to achieve normotensive ranges. Untreated hypertension
<br>
carries enormous health risks, such as increased risk of heart disease,
<br>
stroke, kidney disease, and eye disease, yet fear of medication side effects
<br>
and improper prescribing by physicians are contributing to an epidemic of
<br>
hypertension-induced disease.
<br>
<p>&quot;Blood pressure&quot; can be defined as the pressure or force that is applied
<br>
against the artery walls as blood is carried through the circulatory system.
<br>
It is recorded as a measurement of this force in relation to the heart's
<br>
pumping activity, and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).
<br>
<p>The top number, or systolic pressure, is the measurement of the pressure
<br>
that occurs when the heart contracts or beats. The bottom number, or
<br>
diastolic pressure, is the measurement recorded between beats, while the
<br>
heart is at rest. The systolic number is placed over the diastolic number.
<br>
For example, 110/70 (read as &quot;110 over 70&quot;) means a systolic pressure of 110
<br>
mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 70 mmHg. The systolic number is always the
<br>
higher of the two numbers.
<br>
<p>Coenzyme Q10 (coQ10) and garlic provide aid in the reduction of blood
<br>
pressure. These supplements may also mitigate the underlying disease that
<br>
may be the cause of hypertension.
<br>
<p>In March 1999, the results of a randomized, double-blind trial among
<br>
patients receiving antihypertensive medication was published. Patients known
<br>
to have essential hypertension and presenting with coronary artery disease
<br>
were given 60 mg of CoQ10 twice a day. The doctors conducting the study
<br>
stated, &quot;Findings indicate that treatment with Coenzyme Q10 decreases blood
<br>
pressure, possibly by decreasing oxidative stress and insulin response in
<br>
patients with known hypertension receiving conventional antihypertensive
<br>
drugs (Journal of Human Hypertension, 1999 [March], 13 [3]:203-8)
<br>
<p>Studies continue in this area, with investigations pointing strongly toward
<br>
the benefits of garlic, fish oil, and coQ10 aiding in the treatment of
<br>
hypertensive disease. The amount of standardized garlic extract needed to
<br>
lower blood pressure is 1500 to 6000 mg per day. The amount of coenzyme Q10
<br>
needed to lower blood pressure is 200 to 300 mg per day.
