<em>&gt; &gt; So, let's take a look at how much of America could really be claimed by the descendants of slaves if basic Lockean and libertarian rights theory is fairly applied. It might end up being a lot more than 40 acres.

<em>&gt; Hmm. That raises an interesting larger question about Libertarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I hope somebody smarter than me can answer-- how would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transfer/sale/inheritance of stolen goods be handled in Libertopia?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does it automatically revert to the original owner if they can prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they are, or would 'posession is nine tenths' prevail? Also, do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarians support inheritance of debt?
</em><br>
<p>I would expect that those who paid the property taxes on the land for
<br>
the past 135 years could put a lein on it if it were seized for
<br>
reparations. I doubt that many african americans would be willing to
<br>
mortgage the land just to catch up on back taxes and would just quit the
<br>
claim on the land.
<br>
<p>Frankly, I'd like to see the federal government give away a chunk of the
<br>
30% of the US it owns 'in trust' to African Americans in reparations.
<br>
Those who are productive would go out and get to work improving the
<br>
land, those that aren't would sell their land on the open market at
<br>
steeply discounted prices for what they could get for it, and we'd be
<br>
done with this silliness once and for all.
