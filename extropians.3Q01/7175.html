From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Extropian%20principles&In-Reply-To=&lt;008901c141fe$8d652800$055d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; That people justify their actions by calling upon moral principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't mean moral principles are worthless.
</em><br>
<p>That's right, it means that moral principles are inadequate rather than
<br>
worthless as guides to human behavior. People often claim that they are
<br>
fighting for ideas, but notice that unless the ideas are connected directly or
<br>
indirectly to territory and/or resources, no fighting occurs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just look at what people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say they do in the name of democracy and freedom - do you hence consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy and freedom worthless because there are decidely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; un-democratic and anti-freedom acts done in their name? It is important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to distinguish surface from substance.
</em><br>
<p>Precisely so, and that's what I had referenced in earlier remarks. In the name
<br>
of democracy and freedom people have committed some of the most egregious and
<br>
entropic acts. Therefore we should note that it is not democracy and freedom
<br>
(or any other moral principles) per se, which actually motivate people.
<br>
However, the application of such principles can and does moderate real and
<br>
true motives which have their basis in biology. We should also recognize and
<br>
acknowledge what motivates people to apply moral principles is also grounded
<br>
in biology, viz., the desire for territory and resources which become
<br>
available upon such application. To phrase it plainly, people endorse and
<br>
promote principles which deliver territory and resources to those they deem
<br>
worthy of said possession. For example, the US gives lip service to democracy
<br>
and freedom while incarcerating a higher percentage of its citizens than any
<br>
other country in the world. So, as we can see, extropic principles do not
<br>
necessarily coincide with what some call moral priniciples. Rather than resort
<br>
to the specious practice of moralism (which, as we've noted, too often
<br>
eventuates in dishonest and entropic behavior), we instead administer our
<br>
territory and resources on the basis of extropic results and repercussions.
<br>
Bottom line: When it comes to moralism versus extropy, extropians decide in
<br>
favor of extropy.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
