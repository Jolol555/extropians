<em>&gt; &gt; And for long distances, the problem is the necessary tunneling depth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A train from NY to LA would be over 250 miles deep at the center.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The deepest hole which has ever been dug was less than 10 miles
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its far worse than that, as you go deeper it gets much warmer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe the deepest mines now have problems with plastic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deformation of the rocks and explosions where the pressure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can expel weakly bonded rocks.  So you have to line the tunnel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a strong material.  
</em><br>
<p>You also cannot go beyond the crustal lithosphere in depth. Once you hit
<br>
the zone between the crust and the outer mantle, you are dealing with
<br>
molten rock. The NY to LA route also has to deal with upwellings,
<br>
especially the major western US upwelling that peaks in the Yellowstone
<br>
area, but is actually a bit of a ridge from north to south that is
<br>
between 20-50 km below the surface. You would need VERY active cooling
<br>
to establish a hardened tube through this zone and maintain it. Needless
<br>
to say, it would be an interesting terrorism target to destroy.
<br>
Geological history shows that this upwelling has flooded most of the
<br>
western US with lava at different periods. Since we got into this
<br>
discussion, I think, as an alternative to the threat of using aircraft
<br>
as terrorist weapons, I think this kinda rules it out.
<br>
<p>This sort of system may work fine on the moon, where there are no
<br>
tectonics of any consequence, but I think that any such tube system
<br>
would have to remain pretty close to the surface on earth, using
<br>
geothermal power generated to overcome frictional losses, either from
<br>
rolling on track or via magnetic levitation. 
<br>
<p>You would also have to deal with drag from vacuum pressures. Since you
<br>
can never produce a perfect vacuum, there will be some gas within the
<br>
evacuated tube that will compress in front of a train capsule and expand
<br>
behind it, thus producing a drag on the system.
