</em><br>
<p>You know, Lee, after reading your replies to some posts for the last few
<br>
weeks, I note that you tend to take what people write very literally.
<br>
Speaking for myself, I often take poetic license in trying to impart the
<br>
essence of what I am trying to say - sometimes what I write is meant
<br>
figuratively, not literally.  In your reply above, you are asking about
<br>
&quot;what possible incentive&quot; would a person have to lie awake at night thinking
<br>
about ... farmworkers?   I was simply suggesting a &quot;looking at the forest&quot;
<br>
approach to your inspiring story about heroic supermarket marketeers.
<br>
<p>But since you brought up &quot;what possible incentive would anyone&quot; ...how about
<br>
being motivated by integrity, gratefulness, and caring?
<br>
<p>Now, yes, it's easy to imagine &quot;a man on horseback&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; as a recent poster put it, or a &quot;Stalin&quot; whose heart would be in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right place; but over and over we learn what happens when that approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is tried.
</em><br>
<p>I believe in the system of checks and balances.  The snipped part of my
<br>
query from yesterday initially asked (take this literally, please) for an
<br>
example of when in U.S. history was there a period when a halcyon
<br>
libertarian existence bloomed o'er all our lucky little lives.  Please
<br>
enlighten me on this question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that what is happening, Olga, is that you divine *your own*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivations, and find them quite pure.  I agree.  I am certain that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you really do have the best interests of the farm workers in mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But you don't lie awake thinking of it at night.  Instead, just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rest of us, you lie awake thinking of your own problems, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a horrible mistake to think that a great leader will do any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differently.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I don't know where you come up with this &quot;great leader&quot; concept -
<br>
I've never espoused anything like that.  As to the farmworkers' problems -
<br>
you're right, reading that article made me think of a problem *I* used to
<br>
have (before my children grew up) - i.e., virtually no childcare in our
<br>
country.  I've stated before I believe childcare from babyhood on would do
<br>
well being joined to our public school system.  I believe in &quot;family
<br>
values,&quot; you see.
<br>
<p>So all of his wonderful speeches about &quot;benefitting
<br>
<em>&gt; the people&quot; are mainly power ploys to defeat his adversaries, gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power from the (ignorant) crowds, and ultimately work towards his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own best interests.
</em><br>
<p>Begging your pardon -- whose wonderful speeches?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; While supermarket customers' &quot;body language, their shopping patterns,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; most of all, their buying habits&quot; may indeed be worthy of a specialized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; field of study, I'm afraid farmworkers' problems are all pretty much the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I was invoking a kind of literary device by using some of your ideas,
<br>
but turning them into another perspective.  (Not just tree, tree, tree ...
<br>
but forest, forest, forest.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here is the fatal urge.  You read about some unfortunate situation such as
</em><br>
this,
<br>
<em>&gt; and you want to DO SOMETHING.  (Of course, it's really none of your
</em><br>
business;
<br>
<em>&gt; you actually spend most of your time worrying about your own *local*
</em><br>
problems.)
<br>
<em>&gt; Hence even if it means for a great leader, or the government, to TAKE
</em><br>
IMMEDIATE
<br>
<em>&gt; ACTION BY SEIZING ALL ASSETS OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE THAN THEY NEED,
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; have an immediate sympathy for something, so long as it solves the
</em><br>
problem.
<br>
<p>As for this one, I'm with Miriam English (who recently wrote:  &quot;Helping the
<br>
poverty-stricken to have a chance at a good and comfortable future is not
<br>
just good for the poor, but good insurance for the rich.&quot;).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Look at the words in that paragraph I snipped:  the &quot;need for children's
</em><br>
programs&quot;,
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;96 percent of the children live in poverty&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, all sorts of people everywhere in the world and all throughout
</em><br>
history have
<br>
<em>&gt; **needs**.  We must not focus on the so-called causes of poverty, but
</em><br>
rather focus
<br>
<em>&gt; on how *anyone* ever escaped poverty.  To find out how wealth is created
</em><br>
in the
<br>
<em>&gt; first place, one must start with Adam Smith, or any thinker who really
</em><br>
tries to
<br>
<em>&gt; get at root causes.  Wealth was *never* created by taxing one sort of
</em><br>
people and
<br>
<em>&gt; benevolently bestowing it on those who have *needs* by means of
</em><br>
&quot;programs&quot;.
<br>
<p>No, wealth is created by using one sort of people and benevolently bestowing
<br>
&quot;needs&quot; (such as expense accounts, first-class air tickets, membership in
<br>
golf clubs, and all such necessary little perks) on another sort of people
<br>
by means of &quot;corporate tax breaks.&quot;
