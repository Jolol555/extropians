As some here know, my primary study of non-Western history and culture has been of China (my undergarduate degree was in Mandarin and Chinese area studies).  I have read some, but not nearly enough about Islam, Islamic history and the Middle East. I've been listing Islamic fundamentalism as one of a small list of primary threats to civilization for a decade now, based mainly on the relatively limited amount of reading I've done (which included a fairly thorough study of the Q'ran in my twenties) and following current events.   As I wrote to a group of close friends this morning, my reading for the last few years has focused on a deeper study of the Western Enlightenment.  That project is now on indefinite hold until I become better informed about Islam.  How will Amazon deliver all the books I ordered today?
<br>
<p>You say that very few modern Arabs read the entirety of the Q'ran.  It's actually a very slim book and of the three religions that have &quot;sacrelized the text&quot; (a term I have developed in my own study of religious memetics), Islam seems to be the most concrete in its apotheosis of the &quot;logos&quot; . . . so I wonder about that.  Anyway, I mean to find out.

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg Burch quoted: 
<br>
<p><em>  &gt; make the kids 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; literary experiences rich and positive. Maybe we can put our heads 
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;together 
<br>
<em>  &gt; and come up 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; with suggestions that could have a real impact. After all what could be a 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; greater Extropian 
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; project than the creation of an Extropian generation. 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in broad agreement with you, but feel that the project is doomed before 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it begins.  More about which as soon as I can find more time.  In the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;meanwhile, here are quotes from about the first 20% of the Q'ran that I 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;found particularly chavinistic and inciteful to bigotry and violence: 
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;####  Regarding the Q'ran quotes - very few modern Arabs actually read that book. As with all organized religions, the daily life is not a blind observance of the written rules (except in some small fundamentalist communities). Instead, the &quot;Book&quot; is excerpted, interpreted and adapted to suit those engaged in the power struggle.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In some places the outcome is rabid hatred (usually when additional factors interfere), in others it might be a  (relatively) benevolent and tolerant state (think Moorish Spain).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We can make more headway against religion by being patient, persistent, firm but not needlessly scornful.
