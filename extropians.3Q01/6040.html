Samantha said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I was surprised by a *plonk* over what amounted to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;misunderstanding
</em><br>
<p>Okay, fair enough. Since I hadn't got around to actually blocking Samantha,
<br>
I won't do so, especially as I have to withdraw from the whole list for a
<br>
couple of months in the next few days anyhow (going on a European vacation).
<br>
What she calls a misunderstanding I would have called yet *another*
<br>
ungenerous interpretation on her part of a post from a fellow list member.
<br>
But I'll happily accept &quot;misunderstanding&quot;.
<br>
<p>LIfe is currently too short to make enemies. Thinking about it, it'd be even
<br>
worse having enemies in a world of extended longevity.
<br>
<p>I doubtless have faults myself &lt;g&gt; - it's always easier to spot the mote in
<br>
someone else's eye - and I apologise to Samantha for losing my temper.
<br>
