<em>&gt; &gt; So, in memory of today's sad events I would like to challenge the

<em>&gt; &gt; members of the Extropian community to think long and hard about

<em>&gt; &gt; what ways might be used to create innovative solutions to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrorism that would increase trustability and personal security
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without imposing restrictions on freedoms (in other words, please,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; please lets not make it a debate about guns).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know that there's anything particularly innovative about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these two ideas (and one involves guns, sort of), but anyway:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * Arm and train all flight crew in antiterrorism measures.  If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   entire crew has handguns, you'll need a large number of terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   to hijack a flight.  The political hurdles facing this policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   should be relatively low, as we're not talking about arming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   private individuals, rather airline employees, who would only be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   armed while on duty.
</em><br>
<p>Agree in principle accept for two caveats:
<br>
1) regular handguns are a no-no in flight.  Explosive
<br>
decompression is not anyone's good time. It could easily lead to
<br>
losing the plane and all on board;
<br>
<p>2) Even one armed guard would be a huge and effective deterrent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * Make the cockpit, and perhaps the entire plane transparent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   the outside world in realtime:  audio and perhaps other feeds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   would be continuously be sent to the ground.  Any abnormality
</em><br>
<p>I assume you mean transparent in the sense of continuous
<br>
surveillance rather than actual transparency.  This could be
<br>
done.  The engines are already extensively monitored and
<br>
telemetry beamed by satellite to human engineers looking for
<br>
possible failures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   detected would immediately alert human monitors, who could take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   appropriate action, from negotiation to shooting the plane down.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   In the worst case, where the terrorists still succeded in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   fashion, we'd at least have a wealth of information about what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   happended and who did it, much more than we have now from a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   chance cell calls.  I'm not generally a fan of surveilance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   but I think privacy issues are of less concern on a plane since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   you're already identified and subject to search, and if applied
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   only to the cockpit, only the privacy of airline employees would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   be compromised, not that of private individuals/passengers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It should be applied to the entire plane (except for the
<br>
restrooms).
