<p>Well, what I don't understand why, if restricting your ability to yell
<br>
fire in a theater is a legally regulatable, that restricting the ability
<br>
of the media to bias the election cannot be similarly regulated. Our
<br>
right to vote, after all, is the lynchping of our entire system, and
<br>
nothing else should be allowed to interfere with the individuals right
<br>
to make their own decision. Liberals are always eager to talk about how
<br>
the courts are there to ajudicate boundary overlap of different rights.
<br>
In this case, the media's free press rights overlap the rights of every
<br>
voter to vote equally, unbiased by outside influences outside of
<br>
persuation on party platforms, etc. Which is to be considered greater? I
<br>
say the right to vote is more important.
<br>
<p>On election day, the right to vote should be treated sacrosanctly, with
<br>
all others subservient to that imperative for that day.
