<p>&lt;smile&gt;  Not yet... but there is one you can get to be

not-male.

<em>&gt; Gee, Loree, I don't know your wife at all, so I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Thinking we are about the same on... I might have a
<br>
slight edge.  She has a better education (BA) and as a
<br>
worker, she is definitely superior.  I am a bit more
<br>
creative.  All in all things balanced out.
<br>
<p>I believe her evaluations were better.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Did you notice any changes when you became not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; white male?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p>But you didn't answer my question.  Has your life been
<br>
impacted personally by affirmative action (e.g. did
<br>
you not get into the school of your choice, loose out
<br>
on a job or promotion simply because you were a white
<br>
male?)
<br>
<p>Most men don't recognize male privilege, most whites
<br>
don't recognize white privilege.  Having been both man
<br>
and woman, and having been married to two different
<br>
ethnic minorities and lived in ethnically diverse
<br>
urban communities most of my life, I have seen both
<br>
with my own eyes.
<br>
<p>In the 70's, 80's and 90's it's possible that the PC
<br>
crowd over did things... but equality of opportunity
<br>
for blacks and whites is still mostly a myth white
<br>
people tell themselves.
