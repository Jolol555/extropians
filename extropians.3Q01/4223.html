<p>Yes, but on the other hand it is exactly as it should be - we are not striving
<br>
to impose a definite ontology or posthumanity on everybody else, but rather
<br>
enable an evolutionary radiation in many different directions. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anders Sandberg writes

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, cybergnosticism - the material world is inefficient and impure, and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should strive to become pure information - is unfortunately rampant among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanists. But that doesn't mean it is a very workable philosophy, IMHO.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, why would one on principle strive to become &quot;pure information&quot;, as if there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was such a thing independent of the material world anyway?  Of course, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are many shortcomings to the material world; but we have known that for hundreds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of thousands of years, and take great pains to live in artificial realities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the time. 
</em><br>
<p>I think Waldemar had a good point in saying that cybergnosticism is a step away
<br>
from something. It is a way of hiding from some uncomfortable part of reality.
<br>
Which is of course what wearing clothes and having warm houses are about too,
<br>
in a way. The difference is that the cybergnostic is not striving for the
<br>
practical benefits but rather the ethical/aesthetic &quot;purity&quot; of not being
<br>
embodied. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anders continues,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As I see it, uploads are still going to be embodied. As I argued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at TransVision 00 in London, uploads might actually be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; obsessed with their bodies than we are currently!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This might occur for a while, but soon the innate slowness of the physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world would take its toll.  Since one can think, experience, and enjoy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions of times faster in virtual reality than when constantly inter-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acting with the &quot;real&quot; world, I expect my outside sensors not to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overly busy.
</em><br>
<p>This depends very much on the particular uploading scenario, and the
<br>
availability of computing power.
