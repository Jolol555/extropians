<p>Actually, the machines are in use to day to scan many thousands
<br>
of faces in real time from glimpses by cameras and identify with
<br>
high accuracy who the person is.  So we are at least well on the
<br>
way in limited domains.  But if a machine does your thinking for

you exactly what do you plan to do with your time?
