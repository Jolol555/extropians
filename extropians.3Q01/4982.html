</em><br>
<p>The Singularity Institute does not.  There are legions upon endless
<br>
legions of organizations devoted to damage control in the here and now. 
<br>
Most people aren't aware that any other kind of damage control exists. 
<br>
Those institutions have plenty of funding.  We don't and we are not
<br>
interested in eating our seed corn.  There is no reason for the
<br>
Singularity Institute to get involved unless there's an AI or
<br>
ultratechnology or Singularity aspect to the potential problem, something
<br>
that puts it out of reach of the people who would otherwise attempt to
<br>
deal with it.
<br>
<p>If/when we have a prototype AI, there may be certain classes of
<br>
here-and-now social problem that can only be solved by SIAI - for example,
<br>
if an infrahuman AI system in our possession is sufficient to turn a
<br>
then-modern PC into a better educational system than a current-day public
<br>
school, thus enabling us to solve the problem by throwing hardware at it. 
<br>
This would also constitute a legitimate rationale for SIAI's intervention.
<br>
<p>Finally, Brian Atkins is not the Singularity Institute.  When he sneezes,
<br>
the Singularity Institute does not blow its nose.  It takes a majority of
<br>
the Board, speaking in their official capacity, for that to happen.  Thus,
<br>
Brian is not obligated to watch his every word in case someone
<br>
misinterprets it.  Please do bear this in mind.
