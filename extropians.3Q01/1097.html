Samantha, I do think you're being too tolerant here.  Can you give me an
<br>
example of a correct conclusion or useful strategy that can be arrived at
<br>
by being religious and cannot be arrived at in any other way?  Actually,
<br>
let me ease that requirement; can you show me a strategy or knowledge
<br>
which is easily *invented* by religion but is harder to arrive at through
<br>
rationality?
<br>
<p>Even so, I wouldn't want to be religious because, to my mind, it's better
<br>
to be rational and strive to improve that rationality than to do something
<br>
that has short-term benefits but is crippling in the long term.  But what
<br>
I'm asking for here is an example of even a short-term cognitive benefit,
<br>
and by that I mean &quot;coming up with a right answer&quot;, and not alleged lower
<br>
stress levels and so on.
<br>
<p>I do want to strengthen my challenge a little bit beyond asking for an
<br>
instance of when a normally confused person will benefit from religion,
<br>
because some minds out there are so disorganized that essentially random
<br>
behavior sets are categorized as &quot;religious&quot; or &quot;rational&quot;.  I've known
<br>
people, for example, who thought that deliberate &quot;rationalization&quot; of
<br>
false beliefs was a recognized part of &quot;rationality&quot;(!).
<br>
<p>What I'm asking for, then, is a case where religion provides a cognitive
<br>
benefit to someone with moderate strength and depth of rationality.
