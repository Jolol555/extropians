</em><br>
<p>Well, that is just plain foolishness since it is counter
<br>
to all of the evidence -- governments kill far more citizens
<br>
that even crime (and armed honest citizens can defend themselves
<br>
from both.)
<br>
<p>Increasing the number of armed (concealed carry permits) reduces
<br>
crime.  No one has seriously considered attacking Switzerland
<br>
for hundreds of year -- practically all male citizens have an
<br>
ISSUED &quot;AUTOMATIC WEAPON&quot; in their homes and crime is lower than
<br>
almost anywhere.

<br>
<em>&gt; I know that its the habit of a lot of people to start quoting statistics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this one. Some stats are valid, others are questionable. I ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is something that should be defended on principle. I don't care if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guns do cause more crime. What I do care about is my right to self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defense.
</em><br>
<p>YES.
<br>
Actually, MORE GUNS LESS CRIME but that is -- as you say -- not
<br>
the point.
<br>
<p>The point is that WE have the right to defend our LIFE and our
<br>
LIBERTY though arms.  We have that right as long as we insist
<br>
upon that right and guard that right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Imagine a world with no guns, where intruders now break in your house
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knives and sticks. How do you defend yourself at that point? More knives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<p>Actually there is strong evidence that baring all guns successfully
<br>
-- which is likely impossible but assume it for a moment -- would
<br>
INCREASE crime against individuals AND increase injuries from such
<br>
crime.
<br>
<p>Without arms in private hands, only the BANKS and other places with
<br>
MONEY can afford the &quot;armed guards&quot; and even more criminals would be pushed
<br>
out of these niches to the streets where they would prey on the relatively
<br>
helpless.  
<br>
<p>If may even be safer to robbed by an assailant with a firearm than
<br>
a stick or a knife.  With the 'less' lethal weapons the attacker
<br>
is more likely to USE it for 'demonstation' purposes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; sticks? Try and figure the odds of you winning that kind of a fight, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average, Id say 50/50 (if there is only one of them). I have a right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defend myself using the most powerful reasonable tools allowable (no, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously don't mean nukes). When someone is in my house at night and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am
</em><br>
<p>Guns are egalitarian.  A 90lb woman of average strength is equal to
<br>
a large, strong, and PRACTICED male assailant IF she is armed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; responsible for protecting my family (not the police, or Interpol, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whomever), you can bet Ill take maximum precautions to protect my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family.
</em><br>
<p>In the United States it is a MATTER OF LAW that the police are
<br>
NOT required to protect you.  The police are charged with mainting
<br>
the PUBLIC (general) order, and finding the criminals AFTER the
<br>
crime.
<br>
<p>In general, ONLY THE POTENTIAL victim can reliably provent the crime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Understand what I'm saying, I don't care about statistics... You can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them any which way to Sunday and so can the other side. In principle it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong to remove the best means of self-defense from law abiding people,
</em><br>
<p>RIGHT
<br>
<p><em>&gt; because even if you could manage to get the guns out of the hands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criminals (impossible), it wouldn't change my situation of defending my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family a whit.
</em><br>
<p>RIGHT again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here's the possibilities once again...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have gun, intruder has gun.			Outcome 50/50
</em><br>
<p>No, I have excercised my intelligence and due diligence to 
<br>
PRACTICE with my firearm regularly, to ARRANGE my home to 
<br>
my defensive advantage, and the intruder does NOT know my
<br>
home or my WILLINGNESS to resist and protect my family.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You don't have gun, intruder has gun.		Outcome 5/95 your dead
</em><br>
<p>Give him your stuff.  Say thank you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You don't have gun intruder doesn't have gun.	Outcome 50/50
</em><br>
<p>No, it is worse, once you resisst without arms, you get hurt more
<br>
than by passive resistance (on average.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have gun, intruder doesn't have gun.		Outcome 95/5 you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; win
</em><br>
<p>He only gets the 5% if I am not doing what I am supposed to do.
<br>
<p>STAY ALERT.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So if you don't have a gun, your chances are 50/50 and 5/95 your dead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you do have gun your chances are 50/50 and 95/5 you win. Now you pick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best chance at surviving. (note: these don't count as statistics, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deduction :P )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if anyone wants to take this over to exi-freedom, Ill agree. That's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where this discussion belongs as has been stated in the past so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times.
