<p>Actually, that's not correct--the pro-GM industry has lost it through 
<br>
its own blundering incompetence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If GM foods are to continue to be a viable technology, we must be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;able to control it so that we decide whether it goes into our food 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or not. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, you know, another blundering bad-PR strike against these guys 
<br>
is their rabid insistence that there BE no labeling and, hence, no 
<br>
choice. 'You'll eat it and drink it and pay us to do it whether you 
<br>
want to or not,' has been their attitude from the start--just like 
<br>
the food-irradiation guys.
<br>
<p>And they wonder why people don't trust them...

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;From Reuters,

<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010704/ts/food_starlink_dc_1.html">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010704/ts/food_starlink_dc_1.html</a>

<em>&gt; This greatly disturbs me, and could be a setback to the food industry and GM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foods in general.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; StarLink corn was banned for human use, yet it was discovered in many human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products.  It is a form of yellow corn, but now is being found in white corn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products.  This makes it clear that we cannot keep contaminated products out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our food.  Even industry officials say that there is no way they can keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different kinds of corn separate.  Many industries actually switched to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; white corn to avoid using StarLink corn, and it still ends up in the food.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This demonstrates the industry's inability to follow laws or safety
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedures to keep contaminates out of food.  If anyone does develop a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really dangerous strain of food, it would appear that we would be unable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep it out of the general food supply.  This needs to be fixed and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addressed if we want to continue developing GM foods in a safe manner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am also disturbed by the way this problem was discovered.  A Florida
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person who had already had a bad reaction to StarLink corn in yellow-corn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products had the same symptoms when he ate the white-corn products.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deliberately switched to white-corn products to avoid StarLink, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reportedly had no way to guess that white-corn could ever contain StarLink.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He says that he recognized the side-effect symptoms as being the same, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he notified the FDA who confirmed the presence of StarLink.  This seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrate that the side-effects of StarLink are real and not imagined.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also is very bad PR if GM food is seen as being detectable by the health
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems of consumers who eat them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If GM foods are to continue to be a viable technology, we must be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control it so that we decide whether it goes into our food or not.  We also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need better tests to detect side-effects.  The industry insisted that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were no side-effects, and that reported effects were imagined, but here we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a serious counter-example.  These kind of events are going to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deciding factor for most consumers.  Scientific tests, studies and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanations simply cannot compete with customer experiences in these areas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a battle of memes, the anti-GM factions have won this round.
