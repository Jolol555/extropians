matter
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'll probably think I'm nitpicking. I could understand if that were your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response, but I'm not sure that it is just nitpicking. The fact is that
</em><br>

moral
<br>

</em><br>
<p>Wading in to the middle of this one...
<br>
<p>Legal is different from moral, but this does not speak to the issue.  Theft
<br>
can only be defined when there is some level of property defined.  Theft is
<br>
taking someone else's property without consent -- usually wittingly so,
<br>
e.g., when someone steals your car, knowing it belongs to someone (not
<br>
thinking it's just out there).  Since inside Lockean or Randian and most
<br>
other theories of property rights or even more generally just theories of
<br>
property without necessarily rights, there is no need for a state to define
<br>
property -- something becomes property or the title to it can be transferred
<br>
without need of a state to define it as such -- then the state is not
<br>
necessary to define theft.
<br>
<p>If you accept this, then it is possible for the state to steal.  Since the
<br>
state does not define theft or property, there's the possibility that state
<br>
actions can conflict with property.
<br>
<p>That many would prefer the legal definition -- because it makes life less
<br>
complicated, because they equate &quot;legal&quot; and &quot;moral&quot; or &quot;law&quot; with &quot;right&quot;
<br>
or &quot;legal recognition&quot; with &quot;ownership,&quot; because they don't have an viable
<br>
alternative to it -- is no argument here.  We could go over the extreme
<br>
examples that most people would agree where it's right to break the law, but
<br>
that would violate netiquette on the Nazis.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, no, it isn't stolen money (see above). Again, what counts as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;stealing&quot; is defined by the norms of the legal system. The issue is
</em><br>
whether
<br>
<em>&gt; those laws are open to moral criticism, whether having laws that allow for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxation is immoral, whether it is morally acceptable that the legal
</em><br>
system
<br>
<em>&gt; does *not* count taxation as theft. So far you haven't given me an
</em><br>
argument
<br>
<em>&gt; as to why you consider these things to be the case. I can *think* of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments, but I can't see anywhere where you put one.
</em><br>
<p>This is another point.  The law must be critiqued from some basis.  From
<br>
that of economic efficiency, taxation distorts the economy.  It must take
<br>
something away from what people would otherwise do, leading people to make
<br>
less efficient choices.  (E.g., the whole industries of tax accountants, tax
<br>
lawyers, tax consultants, and of tax shelters exists merely to deal with
<br>
taxes.  If there were no taxes, these efforts could be devoted to other
<br>
things.  E.g., the whole industry of currying for government grants -- for
<br>
whatever reason -- exists merely to go after money taxes have taken from
<br>
some.  If there were no taxes, these efforts could be devoted to making more
<br>
wealth instead of chasing after taken wealth.  See, e.g., Larry Sechrest's
<br>
&quot;Rand, Anarchy, and Taxes&quot; in _The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies_ 1(1) as well
<br>
as the follow up discussion of the issue in 2(1) of that journal.  See also
<br>
Sanford Ikeda's _Dynamics othe Mied Economy_ and Murray Rothbard's _Power
<br>
and Market_.  The last book has a chapter devoted to taxation.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From that of individual freedom, taxation must necessarily restrict freedom,
</em><br>
since it reduces the taxpayer's choices.  She must figure into projects she
<br>
would undertake -- if she has foresight -- that taxes will affect the
<br>
outcome -- either directly, as in a profits tax, or indirectly, through
<br>
others being taxed.  Some projects might not even be undertaken simply
<br>
because the tax pushes them from being profitable to be only break even or
<br>
unprofitable -- from an ex ante (from beforehand) position.  Some projects
<br>
thought to be profitable ex ante might be found to not be so ex post
<br>
(afterward) because some a tax makes them less so.  (As happens to people
<br>
who earn more income and then get less total money back because they're
<br>
pushed into a new tax bracket.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a social stability point of view, taxation reduces social coherence
</em><br>
because it separates people by force, into tax payers and tax payees.  Some
<br>
benefit, however modestly or greatly, from the collection of taxes (e.g.,
<br>
actual tax collectors -- who's job it is, the aforementioned tax industry,
<br>
people who receive any wealth redistribution (including not only subsidies,
<br>
but government contracts), and those who indirectly benefit because, say,
<br>
their competitors are harmed more than they are by taxes).  Some are harmed.
<br>
This creates or adds to antagonisms already existing in society.  In time,
<br>
people come to see each other as predators or victims.  (See part three of
<br>
Chris Sciabarra's _Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical_ for more on this form of
<br>
social conflict.  See also his _Total Freedom_.  His web site is at
<br>
<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/">http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/</a>)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, but it's &quot;your logic&quot;. :-)  I doubt that I could convince you that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxes are, or can be, morally permissible, but I'm just trying to
</em><br>
understand
<br>
<em>&gt; why you are so sure they are not. I would think that you'd have to start
</em><br>
off
<br>
<em>&gt; with a theory about when something becomes your property in a sense that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precedes the norms of the legal system (after all, those same norms allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for taxes (!!!), so you have to rely on something deeper).
</em><br>
<p>See above.  Remember, too, that while we live in a society with both
<br>
government and property, this does not mean that one is necessitated by the
<br>
other.  We also live in society with food and government, yet no one would
<br>
argue, I hope, that government is necessary in order for us to have food.
<br>
Also, Locke's, Rand's, Rothbard's, and many other theories of property have
<br>
no need for government to define property as property.  So, it's at least
<br>
theoretically possible to split the two.
<br>
<p>You might also want to read Robert C. Ellickson's _Order Without Law: How
<br>
Neighbors Settle Disputes_ for some historical examples of how people deal
<br>
with property in the absence of government.
<br>
<p>Finally, the legal norms for property in the US, at least, came from earlier
<br>
social customs, not earlier laws.  After all, the government could not,
<br>
initially, just insert itself into the process as naked aggression but had
<br>
to legitimize itself.  (Surely, some governments have ruled through plain
<br>
old naked aggression, but this does not make for a long rule.  Nor would it
<br>
go down well in more civilized areas.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And do you say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there can never be a civic *responsibility* to give up some of your
</em><br>
property
<br>
<em>&gt; (as defined) to contribute to the infrastructure of the society as a whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or to care for people in need?
</em><br>
<p>I think you're missing the point here.  Let's say there is such a
<br>
responsibility, it would still be an individual one and not one for some
<br>
agency to force on individuals.  Nor would such an agency have any more
<br>
knowledge or incentive to get it right -- to be sure that taxes actual go
<br>
toward the right projects or the right people in need.  In fact, once such
<br>
an agency had an individual at its mercy, the only limit would be not
<br>
whether it actually helped people out but how much could it extract before
<br>
they rebelled.  History seems to show us this is what happens.
<br>
<p>As for social infrastructure and charity, it remains to be proven that
<br>
government provides these better than people would voluntarily, e.g., in a
<br>
free market.  I've already cited sources on private road provision.  (See
<br>
Daniel Klein's papers on the subject at
<br>
<a href="http://lsb.scu.edu/~dklein/papers/default.htm">http://lsb.scu.edu/~dklein/papers/default.htm</a>)  You have to ask yourself,
<br>
how did these things happen before the government took them over?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you say that there are never any values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can override your right to hang on to your property, no matter what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral catastrophe may be involved (you gave an example of someone about to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physically melt down with a new form of cancer not having any moral claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over you)?
</em><br>
<p>This would still be a personal and individual matter.  How come people
<br>
naturally help out others in need?  How do parents put their kids through
<br>
college?  Why do some people give money to the homeless?  Etc.  Bringing the
<br>
government into the process does not guarantee the outcome you want.
<br>
<p>Okay, I'm going to do my best to stay off this thread...:/
<br>
<p>Cheers!
