<em>&gt; Robert Coyote asks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Is it possible that all the &quot;atrocities&quot; cause by Religion would just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; likely have happened for other reasons because religion was the excuse for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the acts, other excuses could have served the tyrants uses as substitutes?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If so, then why didn't the tyrants use some other excuse? Why did they choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religiosity? Tyrants can turn anything into religiosity it seems, except for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authentic science. Stalin made communism into a religion, and Mao Zedong did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximately the same. Call it what you will, it still needs debunking, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's still anti-science. And there's no need to put the word atrocities in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quotation marks. They were real atrocities (though I don't think I used that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term, so you're not quoting me).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me but one of the most horrid massacres in history, that
<br>
done by communist Russia and China against their own people, was
<br>
done in the name of science and rational social order.  Oh yeah,
<br>
I forgot, you'll call that religion too just so it will fit your
<br>
itty bitty theory.  OK.  I'll play.  Some would call the claim
<br>
that science and technology explains and has a handle on all
<br>
that is worthwhile and that all it (science) doesn't handle is
<br>
meaningless a religion or at least an arbitrary belief outside
<br>
the court of proof.  So heh, I guess you got me.  Whatever you
<br>
believe enough to use to excuse such shenigans must be
<br>
&quot;religion&quot;.
