<em>&gt; Subject: OWL: On Today's Events
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such events inspire incredible rage and bloodlust in even the most rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of us. But it is in moments of crisis that we are truly tested. We should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act swiftly and forcefully but rationally; we must find the *individuals*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for these acts and hold them accountable.
</em><br>
<p>This is not rational.  There are a few governments in the Middle
<br>
East who are our sworn enemies.  These governments fund and
<br>
shelter terrorist groups.  In some instance they use them as
<br>
their agents of war without having the guts to declare war.  The
<br>
actual individuals are not what we face but nations who stand
<br>
diametrically opposed to all western, progressive and secular
<br>
values and especially the US.  Forgetting that fact or that
<br>
these terrorist act on their bidding and/or support is quite
<br>
irrational and wishful thinking.
<br>
<p>In the past we have attempted to treat such things as matters of
<br>
individual criminality.  That has been a big mistake and is
<br>
quite dishonest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, we must not turn our anger inward and blame our own government for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these events. The events will speak for themselves. Our lives have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permanently changed and our government will change to reflect this either by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its choice or ours. This is a democracy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Blaming the victim is a sign of rationality???
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am proud to be an American. No act of cowardly violence upon us will take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that from me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Then will you defend it from those who hate you for it and are
<br>
sworn to destroy you and yours if they can?
<br>
