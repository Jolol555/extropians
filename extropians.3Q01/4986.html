<em>&gt; So, is there a way to redistribute money to the poorer people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the community to pay for good *food* for their kids, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keeping the advantages of competition, decentralisation, ..?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Food stamps good.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;School vouchers bad.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I never understood why.
</em><br>
<p>The answer is very easy:  in the case of *food*, we come from
<br>
a free-market solution that already works extremely well, so
<br>
naturally it's &quot;good&quot; to weaken it with food stamps.  Likewise,
<br>
we come from a socialist solution to education, which works
<br>
very poorly, of course, and so to weaken it by moving towards
<br>
freedom is &quot;bad&quot;.
