<em>&gt; It's hard to believe that a nutty group like this could have so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many members.  Of course we don't have any proof that they are 55,000.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rael could have just made that number up.  Maybe he's only got a couple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred.  That would make mores sense.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that would make more sense. Thanks for ameliorating my concern with how
<br>
susceptible humans are to irrational belief systems. Political organization
<br>
and the length of time in operation also play heavily on determining the
<br>
relative success of nutty (and occasionally, reasonable) groups. For example,
<br>
although completely nutty, Mormonism preceded Darwin by several decades, and
<br>
established a hierarchy of believers. Consequently, this tightly organized nut
<br>
group has a larger sphere of influence than evolutionary science (at least in
<br>
the US). Remember EMILY? Early Money Is Like Yeast, it rises. The same
<br>
principle works in the new economy (and in memetic migration): Give away
<br>
enough software early enough (no matter how mediocre), and it becomes the
<br>
standard, a la Windows.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
