I would appreciate it if someone who favors a guaranteed income would
<br>
respond to the following excerpt provided by Barbara Lamar from
<br>
<a href="http://www.odyssey.on.ca/~balancebeam/dadless/badwelfare.htm">http://www.odyssey.on.ca/~balancebeam/dadless/badwelfare.htm</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Canada's National Post, December 16, 2000, By David Frum  - an excerpt
</em><br>
<p>Mr. Chrétien's guaranteed annual income isn't merely a bad idea. It's a bad
<br>
idea that has been put to the test -- and flunked. Proponents of the
<br>
guaranteed income take pleasure in pointing out that it was devised by
<br>
Milton Friedman. What they neglect to add is that it was actually tried by
<br>
the Nixon administration in 1969. A large sample of poor working families in
<br>
Portland, Ore., were divided into two. Half were provided a guaranteed
<br>
income; half were left to use the state's existing social-welfare programs
<br>
if they needed and qualified for them. The author of the experiment, Daniel
<br>
Patrick Moynihan, then Nixon's favourite domestic policy adviser, admitted
<br>
later that he was shocked and horrified by the extent to which the
<br>
guaranteed-income families quit working and -- soon after -- broke apart.
<br>
<p>Nixon tried to solve the Portland problem by setting the guaranteed income
<br>
at a very low rate, so low that work would always be more attractive. But
<br>
this solution doomed the program politically: When it finally came to a vote
<br>
in Congress in 1971, conservatives voted &quot;nay&quot; because of the Portland
<br>
experience and liberals voted &quot;nay&quot; because the post-Portland Family
<br>
Assistance Plan (as this family-wrecking plan was euphemistically rebranded)
<br>
was too stingy.
<br>
<p>What Mr. Chrétien needs to grapple with is that the poverty problem in
<br>
Canada is the product of too much government, not too little.
<br>
<p>Brian Williams also writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I just wanted to mention an area the guaranteed income theorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to be missing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What happens to so-called minimum wage jobs?  Don't get me wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the jobs will still be there but they will go vacant, why work for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimum wage when you can make the same doing nothing?
</em><br>
<p>I don't recall that question being addressed either.
<br>
