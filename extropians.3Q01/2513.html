<p><p>As I've heard it, the only reason Native Americans weren't used as slaves
<br>
was that they were unable or unwilling to follow orders and had very short
<br>
useful lives. In fact, by the time the first African slaves were imported to
<br>
the Caribbean islands, the indigenous populations had been effectively wiped
<br>
out.
<br>
<p>Many different Native American peoples were entirely wiped out, their
<br>
cultures and languages lost forever (as just one example, the Karankawa
<br>
people, who used to come up from the Gulf Coast with the first north winds
<br>
of winter to the south central Texas place where I live to gather pecans,
<br>
were totally wiped out. The Spanish struck the first blows, but the job was
<br>
truly finished by the Americans who came to settle Texas in the late 1700's
<br>
and early 1800's)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I don't think you have a strong argument that the Karankawas suffered any
<br>
less than the black slaves, and in fact, even though their culture was
<br>
destroyed and they ceased to exist as a people, the Karankawas may well have
<br>
ancestors now living. These would be found among the Mexicans and US
<br>
citizens along the coastal areas of southern Texas and northern Tamaulipas.
<br>
<p>Affirmative action has, of course, been of benefit to some of these
<br>
people--at least the ones who are US citizens and who can speak fluent
<br>
English. More often than not, the Mexican ones are treated badly, sometimes
<br>
even killed, if they try to come across the border to find work. As one of
<br>
my mentors once told me, life is not fair.
