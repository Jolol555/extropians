<p>What I have in mind is a process much more surrupticious than that.
<br>
Sure, people from dramatically oppresive regimes may indeed value
<br>
the freedom they find elsewhere more than the natives.  But it's
<br>
quite possible that they bring with them cultural baggage that
<br>
subtly undermines the very freedoms they relish.  I have known
<br>
some folks from Eastern Europe who came to the U.S. emphatically
<br>
to escape Communism.  Yet these same people are appalled at what
<br>
other people are permitted to &quot;get away with&quot; here, seeing no
<br>
link between (admittedly) somewhat unrelated aspects of life.
