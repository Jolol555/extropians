To be honest, I got the quotation from Neil Gaiman's _American Gods_,
<br>
and
<br>
Neil's an expatriate Brit.  And I don't know who Agnes Repplier was.
<br>
<p>But at least you can be relieved some Americans can appreciate the

there was an Empire.

<p>Blind patriotism, yeah.  I can be proud of America too, and pick on some

current changes in Britain... of course, I have this cute habit of

claiming
<br>
the Netherlands are the vanguard of Western civlization.
