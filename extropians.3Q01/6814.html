<p><em>&gt;NATO will kill at least 10000 innocent people, women and children
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in Kabul.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of course it is easy. It will be even good for the economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;American and European people will cheer and USA will reelect Bush.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On the other hand, it will generate a lot of people in afghanistan
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who have lost their families, their houses, everything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A lot of people who have nothing to loose. Some million potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do you really believe that this is the proper way you to eliminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorism
</em><br>
<p>Of course this war will cause many &quot;victims&quot; to view the US as the &quot;bad guy&quot; 
<br>
and may even enlarge the ranks of would-be terrorists.  Logically, of 
<br>
course, I realize that a war of attrition is, in almost every respect, a 
<br>
horrible thing.  But sometimes a very bad alternative is still the best 
<br>
alternative.
<br>
<p>I know I have mentioned Hiroshima and Nagasaki as examples of &quot;positive&quot; 
<br>
outcomes from horrendous actions.  And I think the analogy holds.  Remember, 
<br>
the kamikazis were religious fanatics bent on killing the enemy at all 
<br>
costs, even at the cost of their lives.  But *very* few people are willing 
<br>
to attack their enemy at the cost of everything they hold dear, hearth, 
<br>
home, family, country and culture.  That's what was at stake for the 
<br>
Japanese if their aggression continued.  They hated to do it, but they 
<br>
knuckled under and submitted to unconditional surrender.
<br>
<p>I think we have the chance to obtain a similar result from anti-American 
<br>
terrorists if we can raise the stakes to them of continued aggression high 
<br>
enough.  It won't be pleasant, but if we stick with it, I believe it can be 
<br>
done.  And, in my mind at least, if that goal is reached the terrible toll 
<br>
will have been worth it.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
