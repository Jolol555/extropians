Extropes,  
<br>
<p><p>I find the entire governmental encryption-regulation
<br>
effort, and the wider discussion of same, profoundly
<br>
surreal.
<br>
<p>First the encryption capability is already out of the
<br>
bag, there's no going back.  So the regulatory effort
<br>
will only catch the feeble, the deranged, and the
<br>
legitimately dissident.
<br>
<p>I've spoken with Ralph Merkle, and he says a one time
<br>
pad is unbreakable.  Slightly inconvenient--a one time
<br>
pad--, since you have to distribute the pad securely,
<br>
which may require physical distribution.  But how
<br>
important is it to a big time &quot;criminal&quot; or
<br>
international adversary (ie &quot;terrorist&quot;) to achieve
<br>
mission critical coimmunications security? 
<br>
<p>As I understand it, more convenient cryptographic
<br>
methods are only negligably more breakable. 
<br>
Meanwhile, even as the cop/spooks are trying to get a
<br>
key to every lock on every barn door besides the one
<br>
that the horse is long since gone out of, as well as
<br>
every other door on the planet, which locks and keys
<br>
are of minimal legitimate use in stopping the bad
<br>
guys,  the flippin barn, not to mention the rest of
<br>
civilization, is in danger of burning down.  
<br>
<p>It's like generals who plan for the last war. 
<br>
Thoroughly effective eavesdropping on communication is
<br>
over.  It worked very well while it lasted, but that's
<br>
finished now. Get over it and find another way to get
<br>
the job done. 
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<br>
