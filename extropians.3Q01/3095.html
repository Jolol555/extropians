<em>&gt;Joe Dees scorches
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; There is, on this list, a roaming pack of socioculturally ludditic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; conservatives poorly disguised as libertarians, who routinely practice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; collective rugby scrum pile-on attacks on anyone they suspect might have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; possibly put forward something possessing the slightest whiff of the items 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Michael Wiik enumerates.  These are the people who tend to impart a rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; self-contradictory flavor to what is advertized as a forward-looking list, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are responsible for some progressives feeling that they have to keep their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; membership and participation here a 'dirty little secret', and for some others 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; not tarrying long.  Their jihadically intolerant take-no-prisoners blatantly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; memebotic scorched-earth warfare pogram has the unfortunate result of skewing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the median, or at least the most vociferously and frequently enunciated, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; opinion of this list to a point somewhere between John Birch and William Pierce.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Oh for heaven's sake, Joe.  In most cases that I've seen, those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pile-on &quot;attacks&quot; have merely been *many* people expressing their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
And you don't think these people talk to each other, and each cheer what the others write, and egg each other on?  It's like Rush and the Dittoheads here sometimes.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AND TALK ABOUT TAKING NO PRISONERS.  Look at what you wrote, Joe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now honestly,  do you not perceive that---even in the slightest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way---your criticism could just as easily be directed at your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;own post?   May we not lower the level of denunciation just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;little *here*---just for a while (I'm not calling for complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elimination of denunciation, by any means).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Of course the level of denunciation was high; I was giving a doppelganger object lesson in what I have been repeatedly dealt; phrases like 'pinko social collectivist hand-wringing bleeding heart commie LIBERAL&quot;.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;And Joe Dees believes that soon Eric will be accused of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;a troll.  This is completely incorrect, if not paranoid.  Very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;few people are accused of being trolls, and none are who provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;reasoned discourse (such as Eric is doing).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I did not make the statement in question to Eric.  However, I have been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; accused, by those trolling for progressives to slander, of trolling for retros 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to hand a reaming.  Such self-righteous-wing people seem to have a highly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; developed sense of psychological projection which proves to be rootless with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; respect to logical coherency or factual reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Let's count the emotionally loaded words in this.  (First, you *were*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;warning Eric about the libertarians on this list, I was not in error.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Please cite the post in the archives; I honestly don't remember doing so.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Okay.  1 - by those trolling    2 - slander   3 - &quot;self-righteous-wing&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(I think that Joe means right-wing).  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I mean self-righteously right-wing - the secular equivalent of the religious right, and just as absolutist, messianic and condemnatory.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And then there is the statement 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about his adversaries being (or projecting) logical incoherence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not being rooted in factual reality.  Your typos would diminish if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you became less emotional in all of this; you are among friends, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assure you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It was no typo; it is a statement that such psychological projections genuinely do not apply to those for whom they're intended, either in a logicval or factual sense, but are better suited to characterize their authors' dogmatic and hegemonistic tendencies.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(I will omit the part of Joe's post alluding in a sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that I did not entirely follow---and didn't attend to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very much, I confess---to people mailbombing him off
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some list or other.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It was a failed attempt to do so on THIS list; check it out in the archives.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;And what the devil is this &quot;accuse&quot; you of being a &quot;socialist&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;That's making it sound as though being a socialist or having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;some socialist beliefs is a necessarily reprehensible view, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;as though criticisms of those with socialist beliefs were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;devoid of real substance (but consisted only name-calling).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I understand what the person was saying even though I did not type the comment; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this particular extremist clique uses words like 'liberal', 'socialist', 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 'collectivist', etc., or the more vague yet ominous &quot;I know what you are&quot;, as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; if once they invoke these supposed curses, the person to whom they apply or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; misapply them is magically discovered, discredited and defeated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes!  Good, right!  I have seen libertarians do exactly what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say. They'll effectively dismiss arguments and posters by sentences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;containing such terms *without* supplementing those phrases by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rational explanation.  But then, on the other hand, some people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;write things like &quot;socioculturally ludditic conservatives&quot;, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So, you see, it happens from all quarters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I'd have to drop a Spruce Goose load of such denunciations to go to even begin to tilt the balance towards something remotely resembling parity around here.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; No one should expect to voice any view that is not subject to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; criticism, and to sometimes powerful, convincing, and yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; embarrassingly accurate criticism.  It's the price that should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; be gladly paid in the free exchange of ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; At least I am often granted the amusement of receiving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; misapplied and ineffectual ad hominem epithets as if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; actually said something about me rather than about their posters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Um, sorry.  What is your meaning here?  Did you think that that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statement was directed at you alone?  (JUST ASKING! No implication!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or were you referring to the general situation where you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amused by the name-calling people do to you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
#2.
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thanks,
</em><br>
