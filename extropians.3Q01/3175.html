[snipping headers...then I said]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I answered &quot;yes&quot; to all of those questions. Does this make me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idealistic or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  unrealistic? (Or possibly callous).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I mean, answering any of those questions with anything other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than yes means
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that you believe there are some aspects of life in which people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouldn't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  allowed to make their own decisions; shouldn't be allowed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rise or fall on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  their own merits. How does preventing this lead to a better society?
</em><br>
<p>[Then <a href="mailto:JoshCahoon@cs.com?Subject=RE:%20The%20World's%20Fastest%20Political%20Quiz&In-Reply-To=&lt;EPEELOAJBJFJPKFALCGKAELECDAA.reason@exratio.com&gt;">JoshCahoon@cs.com</a> said]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Re draft: It's not conceivable to you that a war, if won by a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side, would lead to a better outcome for humanity than if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other side won, and that a draft might affect the outcome?
</em><br>
<p>Different issue. This is to do with states, not individuals. As I mention
<br>
below, you seem to be valuing states considerably more than the individuals
<br>
that make them up. How is this good? Plus which, you assume that the
<br>
abstration of the state knows better than the people composing the state.
<br>
<p>Freedom of personal choice is important -- if not enough people are
<br>
volunteering to fight in a war organised by states, what does that tell you
<br>
about the disconnect between those who run the state and those who make up
<br>
the state?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Re free speech: It's not conceivable that public airing of military or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patented information might be bad for humanity? That it might not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be in the best interest of humanity to allow unrestrained libel?
</em><br>
<p>No. Secrets always lead to poor products (of all sorts, be that product
<br>
government or a pencil). Intellectual property isn't a good thing either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Re borders: It's not conceivable that a completely open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mexico-U.S. border
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would lead to a mass exodus from Mexico and might just possibly have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deleterious effects on one or both countries?
</em><br>
<p>If the border didn't exist in the first place, you wouldn't have this exodus
<br>
in waiting because an equilibrium would already have established itself. If
<br>
you did take it down: look at the Berlin wall coming down -- good or bad in
<br>
the long term for that part of the world? [Although possibly a bad example,
<br>
as regulation and government meddling over there makes it even harder to see
<br>
cause and effect than in the US].
<br>
<p>What are these deleterious effects anyway? And to people, please, not the
<br>
abstraction of country.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Re minimum wage: It's not conceivable that a repeal of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimum wage might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause greater poverty and other unwanted effects (such as more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inter-class
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strife)? Economics is no science. You ought not be so sure you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know with such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assuredness the outcome of tweaking the parameters.
</em><br>
<p>Oh dear, oh dear. Thesis: any and all attempts to artificially regulate
<br>
transactions lead to an overall poorer society.
<br>
<p>Even simpler: repealing the minimum wage allows companies with X dollars to
<br>
hire more people and pay individuals at or around minimum wage level what
<br>
the market decides that they are worth rather than what a small group of
<br>
people who are complete unconnected with the industry think that it is
<br>
worth.
<br>
<p>And the Darwinian view: how does guaranteeing someone a minimum wage provide
<br>
that individual any incentive to improve themselves incrementally? If it
<br>
takes X effort to rise above the minimum wage (compared to X/10 effort to
<br>
improve a sub-minimum wage incrementally), what do you think is going to be
<br>
the result of this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Re foreign aid: It's not coneivable that foreign aid might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long run for giver and receiver than its absence and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privately funded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign aid just might not be sufficient for this betterment?
</em><br>
<p>What is better for your self-improvement as a person: a) stuffing a dollar
<br>
in your pocket in exchange for a promise that you'll improve your life, or
<br>
b) mentioning that I like your cooking and will buy a pie for (the going
<br>
market rate of) a dollar?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Isn't it possible that you have allowed laissez faire to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the end in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your mind rather than a means? That you just might be in the grips of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideology?
</em><br>
<p>Not at all. [Although I just went and relooked at Any Rand's definition of
<br>
objectivism in a nutshell, and it seems I'm more objectivist than a few
<br>
years ago].
<br>
<p>I look at the faults in the world today:
<br>
<p>1) progress towards immortality and easier lives slowed by regulation
<br>
2) personal growth of individuals stunted by regulation removing incentive
<br>
to improve
<br>
3) freedoms taken away by regulations put in place by people who don't even
<br>
understand the issues they regulate
<br>
4) personal responsibility belittled and diminished
<br>
5) abstractions (countries, organizations) valued more than individuals
<br>
<p>and arrive at my own conclusions, thank you. Freedom is the answer: freedom
<br>
to fail or succeed on your own merits, to make your own deals, to grow as a
<br>
person because you have absolute responsibility over your own life.
