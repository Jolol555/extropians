<em>&gt; Every benefit modern workers enjoy was earned for them by Union labor. 
</em><br>
<p>Really? I dont remember my stock options being paid for in blood, or the
<br>
extra vacation days above the minimum either. You need to learn that supply
<br>
and demand work for LABOR as well as products. If labor is short, they HAVE
<br>
to up pay and benefits to keep workers. Yeah, it was tough at first, but I
<br>
put forth that if the labor movement had just let the industries grow until
<br>
there was a labor shortage, you would have had the same result and probably
<br>
the workers would have had far MORE benefits then today. By artificially
<br>
extracting resources from the buisnesses, they caused an aberation in the
<br>
market that caused buisnesses to grow more slowly, thereby preventing them
<br>
from producing jobs as quckly. This resulted in the balance of supply and
<br>
demand of labor taking even longer to come into balance. They cut their own
<br>
throats.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I sit here less than a block from the scene of the Haymarket square
</em><br>
<em>&gt; riot where union organizers were framed then hung for the terrible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime of trying to establish the 8 hour workday.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>I never said that all the old buisness owners were angels, but I dont hear
<br>
you telling the story of how teamsters were gentle non-violent protestors
<br>
either. How many people did they kill or maim for crossing picket lines
<br>
(when those people crossing were just trying to make enough to feed their
<br>
kids)?
<br>
<p>Everone that wants to slam these &quot;Evil Capitalists&quot; need to be kissing their
<br>
feet for providing jobs for all those people that would have otherwise
<br>
starved. Buisnesses no more set the price of labor then they do for
<br>
sneakers.
