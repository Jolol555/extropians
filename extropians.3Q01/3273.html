<em>&gt; &gt;This weeks New York Times Sunday magazine has an article about &quot;space war&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; King George II seems intent on drumming up support for a space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons platform.  This is interesting for a couple of reasons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, it looks likely to drive a massive wedge between the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and its current allies.  Nobody who can't afford to put up their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own orbiting weapons platform is going to be happy about the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing so.
</em><br>
<p>Since few of the US' current allies have nuclear weapons, those that
<br>
don't have no need to worry, and those that do are more concerned with
<br>
the perceived devaluation of their smaller stockpiles than in actually
<br>
reexamining the new strategic situation in the world. In otherwords,
<br>
nothing much seems to ever change with the european nations. I recall
<br>
that around the same time that the world was embarking on a three decade
<br>
spree of battleship building, the first aircraft ground attack mission
<br>
occured (in 1911 in the Italo-Turkish war, four bombs were dropped
<br>
rather inaccurately and with little effect, only 34 years before a
<br>
single air dropped bomb wiped out an entire city). The governments of
<br>
the world looked at air bombing of ground installations as somehow
<br>
unethical in 1911, less than a decade before strategic bombers were
<br>
constructed in large quantities, and 30 years before carpet bombing was
<br>
a standard military tactic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, it pretty much means the US is going to have to withdraw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the space treaty of 1965, which bans space weapons.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; latter is actually more interesting to me, because that treaty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also bans national claims of sovereignty over off-earth property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or else Neil Armstrong would have been saying the ancient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incantation, &quot;we claim this new land in the name of....&quot; when he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planted that American flag on the moon in '69) and, more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importantly, private claims of ownership on off-earth property.
</em><br>
<p>Moreover, the US never ratified the treaty until the first two years of
<br>
the Clintoon administration. It's history is one of the have nots/nevers
<br>
trying to socialize space and tell those that had the capability that
<br>
they couldn't do something that the have nots had no ability to enforce.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as I know there is no direct legislation banning such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ownership in the US -- so it looks to me like the US withdrawing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from that treaty would allow US corporations to do things like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; register mining claims or other claims on the moon or other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off-earth real estate, or a US expiditionary force to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a national claim of sovereignty over the Moon or Mars or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever the next time there's a government-sponsored landing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on either of those bodies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If someone actually tries it, we'll se an interesting test.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Although, perhaps not coincidentally, a space weapons platform
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orbiting Earth is also exactly what you need if you intend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *defend* claims of national sovereignty on the Moon, asteroids,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mars, etc.
</em><br>
<p>As opposed to, say, claims of world sovereignty over the US.
