<p>Well,  I stated that IQ is not correlated with useful effects for entire
<br>
nations (which was the original context in the previous thread). I admit
<br>
that it is correlated to academic achievements. 
<br>
<p>Honestly, can we say that academic success contributes to the success of
<br>
a nation? Being an avid academic I would dearly like this to be true,
<br>
but I don't think there is much evidence for it. Literacy is good, and
<br>
having free institutions and a strong middle class helps further
<br>
democracy and economic development. But does really help to have plenty
<br>
of Ph.Ds and professors? Scientific development likely correlates with
<br>
having universities, but since you can draw on the achievements of
<br>
others it is not clear that having a lead will give you a big advantage 
<br>
economically and politically.
