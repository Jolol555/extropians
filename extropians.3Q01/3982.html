<p>Mike this issue is even more difficult than the other racism topics we
<br>
have already discussed.  Inusrance companies are businesses and
<br>
businesses are in business to make money.  So who has the authority
<br>
to tell an insurance company who they must insure?  Who can dictate
<br>
what they can charge?
<br>
<p>This came up during the previous election, so if anyone has the facts,
<br>
do feel free to straighten me out.  Im not sure how much of the following
<br>
is true and how much is the traditional election year BS.  It was pointed
<br>
out that the governor of Texas presided over the state with the highest
<br>
proportion of medically uninsured in the nation (true?).  The governor
<br>
did not dispute the observation, however, it is well known that a huge
<br>
problem for Native Americans is a terrible predisposition to diabetes.
<br>
After all, for many generations they ate the kinds of foods that could
<br>
be hunted or trapped in the American west.  Now, suddenly, they find
<br>
themselves in our modern toxic-food environment: high calorie, high fat,
<br>
high sugar, freely available alcohol, etc.  The Native Americans have
<br>
a high rate of diabetes.  The statistics charts show it, and the delta is
<br>
huge.
<br>
<p>Insurance companies know that one diabetic costs them more money
<br>
than a typical cancer patient.  Consequently, in areas where there are
<br>
a lot of Native American and Hispanic, the insurance companies get
<br>
scarce = lower competition = higher prices.  Texas has a lot of Hispanic,
<br>
as does Taxifornia.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, those on the list who have the wisdom of Solomon, how
<br>
do we fairly and justly tell a health insurance company how to do business?
<br>
Since they already know that the cost and risk of insuring a person with the
<br>
name of Jesus Hernandez is in general higher than insuring one with
<br>
the name Michael Lorrey, and in fact there is a high statistical
<br>
correllation of diabetic-susceptibility with zip code, what is the
<br>
answer please?  spike
