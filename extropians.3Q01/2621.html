</em><br>
<p>Here is an example.  Suppose you and your friends want to have secure
<br>
communications over the net that are not detectable.  You could set up a web
<br>
cam on a motorized mount that sends out pictures of the natural environment
<br>
somewhere (robot astronomy is a great choice).  With some care, you can make
<br>
the low order bits of these pictures unpredictable, in which case you can
<br>
substitute noise bits from a good hardware random bit generator (usually
<br>
junction shot noise).  Next, you have to make sure that the encryption you
<br>
want to use for your data gives the same statistical distribution, such that,
<br>
only those with the key can tell that it is not just random noise.  Finally,
<br>
you substitute your encrypted message bits for the low order picture bits
<br>
above when you want to send messages.  This assumes that your friends are
<br>
tracking your web cam, and have software that extracts the bits and tests for
<br>
the existence of a message by decrypting.  Without the keys, snoopers can't
<br>
do traffic analysis on you, or even prove that you are sending anything
<br>
covert.
<br>
<p>As Eugene noted, if a bunch of folks start doing this, the cost of checking
<br>
for it is beyond any agency budget.  This is especially true if you only send
<br>
one message in a thousand frames.  Snoopers would have to spend time trying
<br>
to crack 999 frames of noise never knowing if a message was in one of those.
