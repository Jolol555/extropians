<em>&gt; In general, I dare say, if our economy shifted from a reward oriented society

</em><br>
<em>&gt; (where one receives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reimbursiment for contributing useful to the society), then we would not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this problem. Such a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; worrying about having to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>You are simply replacing one power structure with another, and one that
<br>
arguably has more power to be arbitrary and capricious.  First, who decides
<br>
what is &quot;useful to the society&quot;?  I guarantee that every power seeker will
<br>
be lining up for that job.
<br>
<p>Second, even if the decision of value isn't in direct question, how is
<br>
&quot;doing research&quot; a creation of real value?  Much research is the actual
<br>
determination if something has value.  If twenty people are doing research
<br>
on the same problem and only three come up with viable solutions, what do
<br>
you do?  If there is no payoff associated with the risk, then any crackpot
<br>
can &quot;research&quot; something important indefinitely for equivalent reward under
<br>
your system even if they don't produce results.  If you only pay researchers
<br>
for results, then it looks a lot like the capitalism you are indirectly
<br>
arguing against.  The accumulation of power and resources is often an
<br>
artifact of doing well-designed research; if you intend to prevent this,
<br>
then you end up with situations where you frequently end up paying people to
<br>
waste time.
<br>
<p>Can you address these issues? (Without resorting to behavior modification,
<br>
of course.)
