<p>Mike, I have to call you on this, because it *may* be one of those
<br>
classical examples where you extrapolating from what you know to
<br>
what you think you know (I'm obviously guilty of this as well as
<br>
a recent exchange with Harvey showed).  But playing list-cop,
<br>
I'm not going to let you slide by *that* easily.
<br>
<p>A discussion of Reactor &amp; Weapons grade materials:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://ccnr.org/plute.html">http://ccnr.org/plute.html</a>
<br>
<p>seems to indicate the main elements in weapons are either U-235 or Pu-238.
<br>
A quick examination of my Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 72nd Ed.,
<br>
pgs 11-28 to 11-131 (Table of Isotopes) seems to suggest that those two
<br>
isotopes only decay by alpha particle (He++) emissions which are easily
<br>
blocked from detectors.  The remainder of the decay energy balance
<br>
seems to produce x-rays or gamma-rays, so two questions arise:
<br>
<p>(a) Are X-ray machine detectors sensitive to the X-ray energy frequencies
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;produced by such decays?  (I've taken a course in CCD detectors
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their sensitivity to X-rays is X-ray frequency dependent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if I recall correctly.)  Also, this article:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ndtech.net/archive/newsletter15.html">http://www.ndtech.net/archive/newsletter15.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seems to suggest that there are at least 4 different types
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of X-ray detectors in common use.
<br>
(b) Are the decays of a few kg of radioactive material sufficiently
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frequent to produce a &quot;vaporous cloud&quot; on the screen as you suggest
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(when compared to the X-rays that the X-ray machine itself must be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;producing)?
<br>
<p>In short,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- do you know the physics and devices involved in your statement?;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- or have you seen them in action to be true?;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- or have you heard your claims from a reliable source?
<br>
[Anything else is an extrapolation and of questionable value.]
<br>
<p>You, like I, have a love of rhetorical debate, however if we are to
<br>
contribute to the list productively we have to bury the pleasure
<br>
of &quot;Jumping up and down on someone, yelling at the top of our
<br>
lungs, KILL, KILL, KILL&quot; and instead substitute it with a Joe
<br>
Friday mentality of &quot;Just the facts Maaam, just the facts&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, your comments may be completely accurate, and if so, I'd like
<br>
to know whether or not X-ray machines have been specifically designed
<br>
to allow the detection of radioactive materials (or whether this is
<br>
just fortuitous circumstance).  Note that I'm not disputing your general
<br>
position, as I've had my computer carry-on sniffed a number of times over
<br>
the last couple of years for &quot;plastique&quot;.  I have no doubt that surveys
<br>
for dangerous materials do occur, and that attempts to detect radioactive
<br>
materials or unusual explosive signatures does take place.  Things are going
<br>
to get pretty dicey however when the detection needs to recognize
<br>
particles that carry signatures that are extraordinarily close to
<br>
the bacteria present in our saliva.
