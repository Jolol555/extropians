I am on David Duke's ezine-type list. No discussion but you can send back
<br>
comments. As a philosopher-psychologist with half of his career spent in
<br>
clinical work, I had to coin &quot;WWW Syndrome&quot; for what I was
<br>
observing. &quot;Whining White Wussy&quot; syndrome. Also, WWW fits the never-ending
<br>
vocalizations of these people...waaaa, waaaa, waaaaaaa! Come on guys, buck
<br>
up. If you don't like the culture as it is, design your own.

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; There is current discrimination against white males, which we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; not going to ignore as we address these issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hey, I've read Warren Farrell, myself.  Certain biases against men, women,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ugly people, short people, fat people, poor people (and on and on and on)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exist, and those are all different subjects in their own right (but cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; BEGIN to touch the subject of &quot;white on black&quot; racism that has existed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our country).  As to the &quot;any white male can tell you&quot; - all right, let's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; start with the white alpha male currently residing in the White (no pun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intended) House - can he tell me the terrible trials and tribulations he's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gone through on his road to recove...eh, I mean, on his road to the White
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; House?  I wonder.  Wouldn't he qualify as an &quot;any&quot; male?  Any white male,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you say, huh?  (Get serious!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anecdotal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There actually are places in the U.S. where white people are overtly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discriminated against for the purest definitions of racism, though not many.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Specifically, if a white American has ever lived on an &quot;Indian&quot; reservation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or in an area that is predominantly native American, you will quickly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn what it means to be the &quot;nigger&quot; of society.  I'm talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blatant discrimnation and persecution by the local police and judicial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, preferential consideration being given to people that aren't white,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well as receiving generally poor treatment by the population at large.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, the vast majority of white people haven't lived in one of those areas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I have and it sucked.  My naturally excessive ego allowed me to ignore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and cope with what was an otherwise depressing environment.  In my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience it was comparable to the worst of the backwater Mississippi towns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (going the other direction), having some experience with those locales as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well.  Of course, all those places have one thing in common: they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; largely populated with small-minded twits.
