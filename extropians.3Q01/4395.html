</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; As for pseudoscience and loose thinking, maybe one way handling it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; would be to set up an epistemic policy on the list. Such a policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; would suggest proper standards for what claims could be posted and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; how much empirical or scholarly backup is proper. For example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Posting of claims contradicting known or widely accepted physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; phenomena must be backed up by at least one independent empirical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; study&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As Anders says, punishment is not really necessary: a simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;hey -- list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rules, please read [url]&quot; and general acceptance of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensible nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the list rules works nearly all of the time. If humans have this innate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; desire to conform and have rules, take advantage of it says I.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, but who decides what is 'known or widely accepted physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomena'? Should this also apply only to theories explaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomena, not the phenomena themselves? Do we now need a Board of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientific Correctness to decide what is and is not 'known or widely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepted theory about physical phenomena'? Also, should not individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who ARE scientists here, like Amara Graps or Robin Hanson, be allowed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post their own studies without having to reference one by other persons?
</em><br>
<p>Aiming for perfection and exactitude is admirable, but a common cause of
<br>
things not getting done. I would suggest that what we are aiming for is
<br>
getting rid of obvious clutter only. A list rule requiring a pointer to an
<br>
attributed manuscript that directly addresses the claim would at least go
<br>
some way to cutting down bandwidth hogs like a) posts by people that haven't
<br>
read any of the literature on the claim that they're posting, b) groundless
<br>
counter-arguments and follow-up posts that give references that should have
<br>
been in the initial post.
<br>
<p>Personally, I think that all lists should have the level of URL-inclusion
<br>
that this one does. It's good. The library is out there -- there's no excuse
<br>
not to use it, and no excuse to post from a position of lazy ignorance (as
<br>
opposed to say, determined opinion).
<br>
<p>[Having said that, I should probably run back and check my own posts for
<br>
lazy ignorance -- I know enough to know that I'm out of my depth in talking
<br>
philosophy, but then I try not to make claims :)].
<br>
<p>You should look on this whole thing more as a guideline to making threads
<br>
more efficient, I think. Getting bogged down in trying to define exactitudes
<br>
in a social system such as a list is pointless -- it is probably better to
<br>
have vague guidelines and let the list group mind come to an understanding
<br>
with itself.
