<p><p>This is simply wrong, and shows a lack of historical knowledge with respect
<br>
to the New World.  You do know that blacks were not the only slaves in this
<br>
country, don't you?  Why haven't you included the Filipino slaves from the
<br>
18th century?  Why haven't you included the Chinese, who've been in this
<br>
country almost as long as the blacks and were essentially treated as badly
<br>
until well into the 20th century?  And these are just some easy examples, if
<br>
you study, you will find many more.
<br>
<p>Lots of ethnic groups suffered from slavery and persistent abuse in this
<br>
country, many well into the 20th century.  You only think of the blacks
<br>
because they are the only good example of a group that didn't &quot;correct
<br>
themselves&quot;.  If the other &quot;underclasses&quot; managed to right themselves within
<br>
a generation or two, why haven't the blacks?  The superlatives that you heap
<br>
on the tragedy that the blacks suffered are equally applicable to other
<br>
ethnic groups in this country; you either aren't aware of it or you are
<br>
discounting their herculean efforts.
