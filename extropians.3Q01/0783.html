&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 41'st update of my fly longevity experiments. Except 
<br>
where indicated 1/4 tsp citric acid was added to all bottles, to prevent
<br>
pathogen growth on the fly food. No evidence of mold was detected. As with
<br>
Run #40 increasing the dosage of citric acid to 1 tsp appeared to offer
<br>
some benefit. However I am still not convinced that this is not due to
<br>
chance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor results with tartaric acid first detected in Run #37, are
<br>
replicated here. It does look like tartaric acid is much more toxic than
<br>
citric acid. By comparision acetic acid (white vinegar) looks to be
<br>
relatively non-toxic. Apple cider vinegar powder is mildly beneficial. How
<br>
much of the volatile acetic acid is retained in this powder is debatible.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very low dose lithium appears to be of no benefit, while extreme
<br>
sodium loading with sodium citrate is toxic. Both soy and whey protein
<br>
reduced longevity, but this may be due to dehydration from the
<br>
&quot;dry&quot; looking fly food.

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My personal testing of the satiating ability of various foods has
<br>
continued. This time I tried a low carb approach, by eating nothing but
<br>
white chicken breast meat for a day. Ad libitum intake was 1478 calories,
<br>
which is no different from other low palatability foods. Switching to
<br>
unsalted roasted peanuts increased intake significantly to 2689
<br>
calories. However there was evidence of malabsorption with this food, and
<br>
true calorie intake would have been lower than this figure. Unfortunately
<br>
I made the mistake of trying malvia verticellata tea on the day I tried
<br>
peanuts. This tea has a reputation for causing malabsorption. I couldn't
<br>
help but think about how common severe peanut allergies have become in the
<br>
last several decades. The peanuts I ate would have killed an entire school
<br>
bus load of peanut sensitive children. When I was a child, nobody that I
<br>
was aware of had any peanut allergies. Such is no longer the case.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up till now, with the exception of Astro's no-fat fruit yogurt, no
<br>
foods with a strong taste had been tested. I decided to try a highly
<br>
palatable calorically dense food, to see if intake would be
<br>
modified. Entering stage right is Christie's Chips Ahoy chocolate chip
<br>
cookies. I included 568 calories of chili, so as avoid a protein deficit,
<br>
but ate an unbelievable additional 3487 calories from the cookies, for a
<br>
total daily intake of 4055 calories with cookies and chili! It appears
<br>
that high palatability and high caloric density have a potent synergistic
<br>
effect on calorie intake. I am incredulous at the large difference in
<br>
calorie intake between cookies, and yogurt.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After separating tasty foods from those with little taste, it is
<br>
apparent that caloric density has little or no effect on intake, when
<br>
taste is not a confounding factor. Without the lure of palatability, it
<br>
appears my motivation for eating is solely for the calories, so density
<br>
does not matter. Small food volume may be the reason tasty cookies are so
<br>
much less satiating than tasty yogurt, but further experimentation will
<br>
have to test this hypothesis.
