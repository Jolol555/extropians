<p>Could be, and this is an interesting question, but they certainly do seem
<br>
to appear when the binary data recorders (well, ternary, actually) are on,
<br>
as I said, at PEAR:

<br>
<p>=========
<br>
In unattended calibrations these sophisticated machines all produce
<br>
strictly random outputs, yet the experimental results display increases in
<br>
information content that can only be attributed to the influence of the
<br>
consciousness of the human operator.  Over the laboratory's 20-year
<br>
history, thousands of such experiments, involving many millions of trials,
<br>
have been performed by several hundred operators. The observed effects
<br>
are usually quite small, of the order of a few parts in ten thousand on
<br>
average, but they are statistically repeatable and compound to highly
<br>
significant deviations from chance expectations. These results are
<br>
summarized in &quot;Correlations of Random Binary Sequences with Pre-Stated
<br>
Operator Intention: A Review of a 12-Year Program.&quot; (view PDF) 
<br>
<p>[ <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~pear/correlations.pdf">http://www.princeton.edu/~pear/correlations.pdf</a> ]
<br>
<p>A number of secondary correlations reveal structural features within these
<br>
human/machine databases. In many instances, the effects appear to be
<br>
operator-specific in their details and the results of given operators on
<br>
widely different machines frequently tend to be similar in character and
<br>
scale. Pairs of operators with shared intentions are found to induce
<br>
further anomalies in the experimental outputs, especially when the two
<br>
individuals share an emotional bond.
<br>
<p>================
<br>
<p>Could be bullshit, pure and simple, sure. So could the solar neutrino results.
<br>
<p>But for heaven's sake don't look at these data.
