<p><em>    &gt; I disagree.  You have to do the right thing for the right reasons.
</em><br>
<p>You're the president of the United States and have decided to invade landlocked
<br>
Afghanistan. You're talking to the Prime Minister of a bordering Islamic country,
<br>
you want him to let out airplanes fly over his territory. You know this additional air
<br>
support would save the lives of thousands of American soldiers, men that you as
<br>
Commander In Chief have ordered into harm's way. The Prime Minister says
<br>
&quot;Very well, you can use our airspace because I believe in the long run it will help Islam&quot;.
<br>
You say &quot;No, you're quite wrong! If this war is successful it will increase the probability
<br>
the Singularity will happen and that will destroy Islam utterly.&quot;
<br>
Wise move?
