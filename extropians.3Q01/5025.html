<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The simple fact is that a welfare mother is not likely to be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;afford
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to pay *anything* to educate her children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I think deadbeats who bring children into the world without the means to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;adequately support them should be punished for this unconscionable abuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;negligence, and the children should be placed with more responsible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;parents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A few questions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What of the inalienable right to procreate?  Should that be limited only to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fiscally fit?  Should that right be denied to the poor?  If so, why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't we just sterilize everyone living in poverty until they can prove that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are financially responsible enough to have the procedure reversed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sound a little Orwellian?
</em><br>
<p>Since the 'inalienable right to procreate' is in there with the vast
<br>
majority of our history of surviving as brutes in the wild, where an
<br>
inability to support and defend your family ended up with them being
<br>
eaten or dead (or both, not necessarily in that order), its rather
<br>
obvious that rights posess as an inalienable component of them the
<br>
responsibility on the individual to use them maturely and rationally.
<br>
<p>Children are not objects, they are people with their own real or
<br>
potential rights, and no parent should be able to place their own
<br>
desires ahead of their child's rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think children would be better off in foster care than with their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loving parents, simply because the parents are poor?  Have you ever known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone raised in the foster care system?
</em><br>
<p>I've known a number of such children. The problem with this argument is
<br>
that it is an argument of exclusion: you can't, by definition, know as
<br>
many kids who were in highly abusive households and were never removed,
<br>
because they generally are killed off at a far higher rate than those
<br>
who are removed and placed in foster care. So the question to ask is: is
<br>
being in foster care with unloving parents better for the child than
<br>
being dead from the 'care' of abusive parents?
<br>
<p>As a person who survived an abusive childhood, I have to side with
<br>
foster care. We got off rather lightly. Fortunately my parents were not
<br>
addicts or anything like that and got into counseling, and we have a
<br>
fine relationship today. I read in the papers of too many incidents of
<br>
self involved parents killing their kids left and right, from shaking,
<br>
drowning, dropping, suffocation, etc. and the justice system goes too
<br>
lightly on too many of these people, especially if they are teenagers.
