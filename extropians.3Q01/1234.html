<em>&gt;       &gt; &gt; Nukes are dirt cheap,  during the cold war there were about 100,000 on this small
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       &gt; &gt; planet and there could be that many again or more if this idiotic star wars thing gets built.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &gt; Says who?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vladimir Putin. He vowed that if we build this thing he will remove the single warheads on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his rockets and replace them with MIRV ones just like it was back in the bad old days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MIRV is a horrible invention, it makes missiles more deadly but it also makes them more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vulnerable as they sit in their silos because the other side has MIRV too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This encourages both sides to hit first.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know where you heard this, but both sides still use MIRVs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;If an H-bomb costs $10 million,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today H bombs are essentially free, the only expensive part is the U235 and Plutonium
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that has already been made. You only need a few pounds to make a bomb and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are thousands of tons of that crap around.
</em><br>
<p>Listen, one of the cheapest devices in the US arsenal is a Tomahawk, so
<br>
much so that they eat em like popcorn, and they still cost $750,000 with
<br>
conventional warheads. The 50-150kt nukes made for the Tomahawk cost
<br>
another $1-2 million a pop, and that is cheap compared to an ICBM nuke
<br>
that ranges from 200-500 kt and comes with its own IRV to ride in.
<br>
<p>This is not even counting the cost of the missile itself, which will
<br>
most definitely cost you abuot $10 million, back in the early 1980's.
<br>
Today, it would be more like $40 million or more per missile.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Lets say an H bomb can cause $1  billion in damage,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't be ridiculous, the explosion of 4 tons of fertilizer caused that much damage in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; World Trade Center, your estimate is off by at least 4 orders of magnitude.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not to mention that in seconds one bomb could kill more Americans than have died
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in all its wars put together, far more.
</em><br>
<p>So solly, John. Hurricane Andrew caused $26 billion in damage over the
<br>
entire state of Florida. A nuke concentrates its power in a much smaller
<br>
area, thus causing far less damage. A few locations like New York may be
<br>
high value targets, but I said 'on average' which takes into account
<br>
those warheads that have an equal chance of hitting East Cumquat, Iowa.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;and a country has 10,000  of them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the cold war both the USA and the USSR had between 50 and 60 thousand, each.
</em><br>
<p>Uh, no, the US had about 20,000 and the Soviets had about 30,000, tops,
<br>
at the peak, before either side even thought about sittind down at a
<br>
table.
<br>
<p>And all of this picking nits, John, is truly beside the point. If you
<br>
truly had an argument, you'd use the methodology I demonstrated with the
<br>
actual data.
<br>
<p>Moreover, you'd also have to acknowledge that Mr. Putin and the Russians
<br>
are about the last people on earth who can afford to waste even a
<br>
billion bucks on this stuff unless they sign onto our program. Russian
<br>
just cannot afford to 'build us into the ground' like you are saying. At
<br>
its peak, the total Soviet military budget was actually less than $100
<br>
billion, which took up about half its economy. They are in even worse
<br>
shape today and can't afford to keep their soldiers fed. What makes you
<br>
think that Putin's bluster is anything but that?
