<em>&gt; Once the outbreak became known we would likely have a tremendous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunkering down by people not traveling anywhere near locations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where there are known outbreaks.  The damage to economies might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be much worse than the damage from the smallpox itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is also true that one could probably scale up a crash vaccination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production program if required.  You could synthesize the required
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DNA vectors around the world and do bulk fermentation growth in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wine or beer manufacturing equipment.  You might not get the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vaccine out of it but something is better than nothing.
</em><br>
<p>Most Americans older than about 30-35 have been vaccinated for
<br>
smallpox.  It leaves a distinctive circular scar on the upper left arm.
<br>
Military personnel were vaccinated up until 1990.  Information from
<br>
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5010a1.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5010a1.htm</a>.  The vaccination
<br>
was gradually discontinued during the 1970s and ended entirely in
<br>
early 1980.  So young people have not been vaccinated.
<br>
<p>Does anyone know whether the protection from childhood vaccination
<br>
would help against the use of smallpox as a terrorist agent?  Is there
<br>
some technology to mutate the virus so that the vaccines don't work?
<br>
The reference above describes &quot;substantial but waning&quot; immunity after
<br>
ten years from vaccination.
<br>
<p>The article also says that the vaccine can be effective in preventing
<br>
or reducing symptoms if administered very shortly after exposure to the
<br>
smallpox virus.  This is the currently-planned public-health response, to
<br>
rush whatever stores of vaccine are available into an exposed population.
<br>
<p>I was looking online to see if there was any way to receive
<br>
smallpox vaccination, even if it were expensive.  Apparently the
<br>
vaccine is not available to the public under any circumstances
<br>
short of exposure.
<br>
<p>The smallpox vaccine is based on the vaccinia virus (which is where
<br>
the name &quot;vaccine&quot; comes from), so I don't fully understand why
<br>
concerns about smallpox virus availability required withdrawing
<br>
the vaccinia-based vaccine.  Recently more production was ordered,
<br>
but it will supposedly not be available until 2004, according to
<br>
<a href="http://www.healthresearchbooks.com/articles/vaccinations2.htm">http://www.healthresearchbooks.com/articles/vaccinations2.htm</a>.
<br>
<p>One would think that smallpox would not be the biological weapon of choice
<br>
against a population where perhaps half the people had been vaccinated
<br>
against it.  I'd like to get more informed information about our actual
<br>
risk against this particular disease.
