&nbsp;Weather Report
<br>
Cloudy, With Possible Tidal Wave
<br>
<p>By Fred Reed
<br>
<p>We should think about the Chinese. We are going to hear more from them.
<br>
Several lives ago, after Saigon fell, I was free-lancing around Asia, and went
<br>
to Taiwan to await the next war, which didn't come. I'd been there before, to
<br>
visit friends in the military. This time I stayed, signed up for intensive
<br>
Chinese at Gwo Yu R Bau, actually a newspaper but with a language school
<br>
attached. My abode was an apartment shared with a tiny Japanese mathematician
<br>
named Sakai, two Chinese graduate students, and Ding Gwo, a local kid who
<br>
wanted to be a rock guitarist.
<br>
<p>It wasn't the golf tour. In the winding warrens and back alleys, gringos were
<br>
sparse to none. I struggled for four months against four hours a day of
<br>
Chinese conversation, and gutted out the written language in off hours. It was
<br>
work, but soon I spoke a subset of the language, and could plough through a
<br>
pulp novel with lots of help from the dictionary. This allowed me to acquire a
<br>
girlfriend, a nurse whose family lived down-island in Pin Tung.
<br>
<p>As an introduction to the Chinese, it was nothing if not direct.
<br>
<p>These folk can be packaged as exotic. The sounds and smells of those densely
<br>
peopled labyrinths, the bustle and press, the open-fronted workers restaurants
<br>
with the flat white sheets of fish and tiny squid like gray vitamin pills with
<br>
fingers - these carry the credentials of the exotic. And my god, Wan Wha,
<br>
relic of a far older China, where the snake butchers worked. (The name means
<br>
&quot;Ten Thousand Glories,&quot; definitely a whitewash.) There, snakes hanging in
<br>
stalls were skinned and the blood squeezed into a glass to be drunk at a high
<br>
price by superstitious workers. &quot;Dwei shen-ti, hen hau&quot;: Good for the body.
<br>
<p>But this would be literary fraud. In truth the Chinese were as exotic as
<br>
potatoes, though not as mysterious. There were agreeable, courteous without
<br>
being neurotic about it, and concerned with the same things that concern us.
<br>
The girls were interested in the boys and the boys were interested in the
<br>
girls, who were not loose but certainly warm-blooded. Children played at
<br>
soldier and space men. People worried about paychecks, kids, grandma's heart
<br>
condition. Presbyterians are stranger.
<br>
<p>They were smart, though, and studious, and showing marked signs of economic
<br>
competence. This we need to think about.
<br>
<p>Of an evening I'd come home through tortuous alleys, where housing was cramped
<br>
and intimate and would have appalled an American, There, sitting at
<br>
crate-desks in the narrow ways to avoid the heat, children did their homework.
<br>
You don't see this in Brazil. We've all heard about Vietnamese valedictorians
<br>
in America. The difference between the Vietnamese and the Chinese is about a
<br>
billion two hundred million.
<br>
<p>At the time, every patch of jungle with a colonel and a band of torturers had
<br>
a Five Year Plan for economic development: Uganda on the march. Taiwan, almost
<br>
uniquely, had results. I saw the steel mill in Gau Sheng, the Jin Shan
<br>
reactors. On a story for the Far Eastern Economic Review, I interviewed a few
<br>
of the directors. Some Harvard, mostly MIT. Taiwan is now a serious high-tech
<br>
manufacturing power. Russian can't make a decent personal computer.
<br>
<p>They have all the pieces for a ferocious competitiveness. Hong Kong is New
<br>
York with slanted eyes: They can do entrepreneurial cut-throat hardball
<br>
business. The better American universities are heavily Chinese. These fit
<br>
naturally into a techno-industrial world.
<br>
<p>None of this is true of Arabs, Latinos, Africans.
<br>
<p>China is an enormous, old, and talented world that we know little of. When
<br>
Chiang Kai Shek fled the communists from the mainland, he brought a fabulous
<br>
amount of art. This was well, as the communists would have destroyed it. I
<br>
spent days in the museum in Taipei. This isn't the place for a disquisition on
<br>
Chinese art, but for subtlety, polish and, particularly, a feel for the
<br>
natural world they can match anything the West has done. Their work is
<br>
different, but it's very good. Even the writing, while awkward - they missed
<br>
an important boat by not going with an alphabet - has an odd beauty.
<br>
Hand-written characters almost wiggle and swim on the page.
<br>
<p>They are not a lightweight people.
<br>
<p>How the West got the jump on them, I don't know. Modern civilization is a
<br>
white European invention. Yet until, say, 1700 the Chinese were ahead. If the
<br>
mainland has in fact found the formula for sustained economic advance, as it
<br>
seems to have, in fifty years they will be ahead again. Yes, China has a lot
<br>
of peasant stupidity still, and inefficiency, and it's still a poor country.
<br>
So, not so very long ago, was Japan. So, not so very long ago, was the US.
<br>
<p>We are not going to like their rise. They can be every bit as domineering as
<br>
Caucasians, and will be. They are racially and nationally arrogant. So is
<br>
everyone else, but we are not accustomed to being on the receiving end. As a
<br>
nation they bear no love for us, remembering our participation in their
<br>
humiliation by the West in the 1800s. Few of us know of the Opium Wars, the
<br>
Boxer Rebellion, the legations. The Chinese, I suspect, do.
<br>
<p>We would be wise to be circumspect about military confrontation, particularly
<br>
over Taiwan. By linguistic convention we are a superpower. In reality we are
<br>
far weaker than most of us realize. The Chinese fought us to a standstill in
<br>
Korea, and the Vietnamese beat us, when we were militarily paramount. Today we
<br>
have neither the troops nor the will to fight a land war in Asia.
<br>
<p>By sufficient effort, by virtue of better airplanes and the Taiwan Straits, we
<br>
could hold off China for a while. Once committed, we would have no way of
<br>
leaving. There are bluffs to call, and bluffs not to call.
<br>
<p>Years after my time as a back-alley orientalist, I returned with my then-wife
<br>
and tow-headed daughter of maybe a year and a half. We stayed at the Grand
<br>
Hotel, a gaudy and wonderful confection on a hill in Taipei.
<br>
<p>The Grand swarmed with pretty Chinese maids, who were smitten by our
<br>
yellow-haired girl-child. They took her from my wife, not quite asking
<br>
permission, and for several minutes a golden tassel bobbed up and down on a
<br>
sea of dark hair. She disappeared into the kitchen, I think it was,
<br>
reappeared. All the staffs wanted to see this apparition. Finally they
<br>
returned our golden tassel to us. She was cooing and laughing. One of the
<br>
girls said, &quot;You have a beautiful daughter.&quot;
<br>
<p>I said they were intelligent.
