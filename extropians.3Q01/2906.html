I have (about 3 years ago) posted to this list argueing that the plaintext
<br>
puritans have got it wrong. I would much prefer a list of video postcards,
<br>
so I could see body language, tone of voice, verbal nuances etc. I post
<br>
rarely because I'm not altogether sure of how my posts will come across,
<br>
plus my spellings not too good :). But I'm quite happy to make a video of
<br>
myself because I feel I'm slightly more articulate in person than I am on
<br>
paper.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lets face it, man is not made to communicate electronically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cell phones and e-mail may have become common forms of communication in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 21st century, but centuries of evolution have made face-to-face
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication man?s preferred method, says Dr. Ned Kock, director of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; E-Collaboration Research Center in Temple University?s Fox School of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Business and Management.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;There is a principle from evolution theory called the ?repeated use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle,? which argues that we have to repeatedly use a medium of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication, an organ, or a task so that our biological apparatus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes optimized to use that tool or perform that task,&quot; says Kock.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Since we have communicated during most of the past three to five million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years by using face-to-face interaction, you have to conclude that we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimized our biological apparatus for that type of communication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kock argues that a lot of today?s electronic communications takes us too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far away from face-to-face communication, and requires increased cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort on our part. &quot;For example, a telephone allows us to use tone of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voice,&quot; says Kock. &quot;It?s synchronous, so we have immediate feedback on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we say.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But, Kock points out, since the telephone doesn?t allow one person to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other, a bit more cognitive effort is required when communicating over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the telephone, as opposed to face-to-face. &quot;Now, if we go to e-mail,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there?s considerably more cognitive effort required than over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; telephone,&quot; he says.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kock did a study in which he compared twenty groups performing complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tasks--ten groups interacting by face-to-face, and the other ten via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e-mail. The study indicates that the amount of time cognitive effort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (measured as &quot;time&quot;) required to convey a certain number of ideas via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; email is between 5 and 15 times than required to convey the same ideas in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a face-to-face conversation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;In a typical conversation, we exchange hundreds, maybe thousands, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words. If you measure the time it takes for that conversation to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place, and then try to have the same conversation over e-mail and measure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time that takes, you would get a time that is considerably higher than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the face-to-face conversation,&quot; he says.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kock contends that it is our innate schemas that make us view it as more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult to communicate through any medium other than face-to-face. &quot;We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have optimized our biological communication apparatus for face-to-face
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communications,&quot; he continues. &quot;As we move away from it, the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive effort is needed.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Man?s ability to learn, which is the highest in the animal kingdom, may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually serve as a counterbalance to our predisposition to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; face-to-face communications.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;In other words, if we use e-mail for very complex communications for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many, many years, and we avoid face-to-face communications, obviously,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we?re going to become good at using e-mail for that type of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communications,&quot;  says Kock. &quot;But our predisposition toward face-to-face
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communications won?t go entirely away.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where is this leading us? Kock believes to the point that we are trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make electronic communications as close to face-to-face as we can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He points out that some successful online companies like LivePerson.com
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are developing technologies that give a company?s online customers the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impression that they?re dealing with a live person over the Web.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;What is the reason for that?&quot; questions Kock. &quot;The reason is because we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to spend less cognitive effort in communications activities when we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have face-to-face like interactions. Even if those face-to-face-like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interactions are virtual.&quot;
