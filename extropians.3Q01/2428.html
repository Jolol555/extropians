<p>Lee - 
<br>
<p>Congratulations on getting me to de-lurk. That takes a lot.
<br>
<p>When you say that someone is &quot;quite wrong,&quot; a little specificity would
<br>
help. I can find nothing in Olga's statement that is untrue. Are you
<br>
saying that whites DIDN'T profit from slave labor? Or that slaves didn't
<br>
provide much of the labor to build the White House? When you say that
<br>
the Civil War wasn't fought to free the slaves, you're just dancing
<br>
around the issue, which in any case is merely tangential, at best. If
<br>
you next intend to suggest, as is popular in some circles, that the
<br>
issue of slavery wasn't the root cause of the Civil War, then it would
<br>
become painfully obvious that you are the one who is &quot;ignorant of
<br>
history,&quot; or at least have exposed yourself only to the most biased and
<br>
atavistic sources. Rather than clutter up the list with a lengthy post
<br>
on that tired subject I'll direct you to something I threw together on
<br>
this subject:
<br>
<a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~pierres/opinions/opinion050800.html">http://www.eskimo.com/~pierres/opinions/opinion050800.html</a>. I was kind
<br>
of hoping this would be cleared up by the close of the previous century
<br>
- now I'm shooting for 2100. The persistence of this type of BS is in
<br>
itself enough to disprove the myth of inevitable progress.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
