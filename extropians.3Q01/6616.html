<em>&gt; Does anyone see any flaws with this type of approach?
</em><br>
<p>Using this approach you might be able to detect movements of groups of
<br>
people and heavy equipment. However, in this case we would not be dealing
<br>
with groups and heavy equipment. We're talking about movements of two or
<br>
three people over terrain that's inaccessible by any sort of vehicle.
<br>
Suitcase (or van) bombs are likely not IN the mountains of Afghanistan where
<br>
bin Laden is supposedly hiding out. They're probably already in the US and
<br>
other locations where they're meant to be used.
<br>
<p>As far as face recognition software used from aloft, it would be of little
<br>
use. From above, you can't see a person's face if they're wearing a head
<br>
covering that obscures their face, even if you have the most sophisticated
<br>
cameras and software. Since one can't bring in vehicles or march large
<br>
groups of people over narrow mountain trails, bin Laden's people would have
<br>
to be fought on their own terms, and they're far better prepared for the
<br>
fight, since they know the terrain intimately, have supply bases set up
<br>
there and so forth. It would be a difficult task to drop supplies to our
<br>
people from the air because the terrain would make it difficult for the
<br>
ground troops to get to if it didn't land in exactly the right spot, and the
<br>
treacherous mountain winds would make it difficult to hit the right spot and
<br>
impossible to land even the most agile helicopter.
<br>
<p>The most effective means of stopping bin Laden would seem to me to be to cut
<br>
supply lines to the mountains and to interfere with communications in and
<br>
out. I don't think this will stop the terrorist attacks, at least not right
<br>
away, because they've already been planned and the men and equipment are
<br>
likely already in place. I think it would be necessary to have the support
<br>
of the ordinary people in rural Afghanistan. I wouldn't think they'd like us
<br>
much at the moment since our government has just spent $43 million to screw
<br>
with their main cash crop. One would have to do something to win their
<br>
friendship, because without their help I don't think supply lines can be
<br>
cut. I think indiscriminate bombing would be one of the stupidest moves we
<br>
could make and would play directly into bin Laden's hands.
