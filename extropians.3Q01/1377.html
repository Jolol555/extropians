Maybe not this week, but over the many years to come.  :-)

But I'm happy to revisit memory (and future) lane again
<br>
with you.
<br>
<p>Btw, if you're going to complain that we aren't reading

your papers, you should point out which paper(s) of yours
<br>
are most relevant.  It isn't obvious to me when I look at:

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;strategies, but it isn't visible externally). ...
</em><br>
<p>This summary of your position seems completely inadequate to me,
<br>
and I'm guessing to most of the rest of us.  I suspect that you
<br>
really need to write a paper directly on this specific topic,
<br>
where you elaborate your argument in detail.  We just don't get
<br>
it from your many quick summaries.
<br>
<p>Here are some examples of ambiguities.
<br>
<p>Consider very simple artificial life sims where the creatures
<br>
reach a complete optimization of their local &quot;matter&quot;.  How
<br>
does natural selection &quot;fail&quot; in this context?
<br>
Is there some analogous claim about conscious evolution that
<br>
you could verify in a simple artificial life sim, where some
<br>
creatures could self-modify?
<br>
<p>Humans have been self-conscious for millions of years, but
<br>
also evolved a lot during that time.  So consciousness seems
<br>
compatible with ordinary evolution.
<br>
<p>Humans are still changing, with some types reproducing more
<br>
than others.  Some types of our machines also get copied more
<br>
than others. Some types of AIs &amp; uploads will also presumably
<br>
reproduce more.  This makes it seem that humans and their
<br>
descendants are still participating in an evolutionary
<br>
variation and selection.   So how can you say that humans
<br>
have trumped natural selection?
<br>
<p>I think some bacteria are immortal.  That is, they divide
<br>
and may get killed, but are physically capable of living
<br>
forever in a friendly environment.  How is this different
<br>
from your claim that JB/MB have zero hazard functions?
<br>
<p>My main point here is to show you just how wide the
<br>
communication gulf here is.  And, for better or worse, it
<br>
is your job to bridge most of that gulf.  Maybe not here
<br>
and now, but at some point.
