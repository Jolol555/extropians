<em>&gt; How about a strong lightweight elastic tube, you fasten the tube

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; more energy it would use up,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I have actually seen a working version of this being tested.  It does not
<br>
work for very tall buildings.  The weight of many people going through the
<br>
tube quickly becomes too much.  Also, the friction of sliding through it
<br>
causes a lot of heat and damage to the tube and the people going through.
<br>
<p>The question of how to get down from a burning building is not really a new
<br>
situation.  I think helicopters hopping back and forth between rooftops is
<br>
probably the best evacuation method on a large scale.  Having separate
<br>
stairwells in all corners of the building, and a lot of shorter stairwells,
<br>
instead of combining all stairs into a central column spanning the full
<br>
height of the building, would be a good architectural recommendations.  If
<br>
the WTC had fire-escapes at all four corners, not all of them would have
<br>
been blocked off at once.
