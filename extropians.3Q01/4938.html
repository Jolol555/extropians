<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A public school system CAN be economically efficient if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is subject to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the same competetive pressures of the free market, and if all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people are given their freedom to choose (why is it left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wingers seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think we should have freedom of choice in some things, but not in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; others?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Assuming I am understanding what you meant by left wingers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and freedom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice) Mike, do you understand the difference between, say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a local police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; department and a local branch of the KKK?  A police sergeant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may belong to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the KKK group (there's the freedom of choice), but he cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represent the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police department while speaking for the KKK group (i.e., he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot wear his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police uniform, thereby giving the impression that the police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; department
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supports the KKK, although the police sergeant, as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual, can be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; member).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A democracy may support the right of groups like the KKK to exist, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local, state and federal governments cannot ask taxpayers to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parochialism of the kind the KKK represents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the same vein, private schools may exist in a host of flavors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (specializing in upper-middle class college prep, or employ a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creationist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curriculum, or have a foreign language emphasis, or be exclusive for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myriad reasons), but governments cannot ask taxpayers to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parochialism, so public schools are necessarily set at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;neutral,&quot; and open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to all citizens (and even non-citizens) of the United States.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>Good job Olga! You seem to have tripped over another great argument for
<br>
total privatization! I've thought about the impossibility of running a
<br>
public school system morally. You will necessarily force some of the parents
<br>
to pay for things that they don't want taught to their children. Stealing
<br>
cash and then funding an opposing philosophy with it is about as morally
<br>
bankrupt as it comes. I don't believe the same as the bible thumpers, but
<br>
Ill defend to the death their right to free speech about it OR to have their
<br>
own schools where they teach what they want. The constitution was designed
<br>
to protect unpopular speech, popular speech needs no protection.
