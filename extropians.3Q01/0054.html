If you haven't already seen the movie you might not want to read
<br>
the following.

</em><br>
<em>    &gt; above  kind of illogical cold and stupid thinking is the very
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; definition of  deathist.
</em><br>
<p>There are times when death is preferable to life, like an eternal life full
<br>
of misery and ugliness and pain, the very definition of David's life in the
<br>
movie. If that's what you mean by &quot;deathist&quot; then I'm a deathist and
<br>
proud of it.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; like ALL other popular discussion of the future, it is
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; entirely based on the &quot;Turing test&quot; view of lonely consciously
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; isolated beings.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what you're talking about. The movie asks for no more than
<br>
what every other movie has asked since the invention of photography,
<br>
that you form an opinion of the inner subjective state of a screen character
<br>
by observing the way the character behaves. Come to think of it, that's
<br>
exactly what we do with real characters not just movie characters.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Another utterly stupid assumption the entire plot hinged on
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; was the idea that once the mother spoke the special words to the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; android boy, it would suddenly drastically change him and forever lock
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; him into the mind set of only loving the person that spoke the words.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; The only thing that could be done to change such would be to destroy
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; the boy.  It's difficult for us to alter ourselves, but it's absurd to
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; think that an android couldn't be modified.
</em><br>
<p>Of course he could be modified, but if you asked David if he wanted to
<br>
undergo such a procedure so he'd no longer love his &quot;mother&quot; I'll but
<br>
he'd vehemently say no, I'll bet he'd fight you to the death. For one thing
<br>
such a modification would have to be so drastic he'd no longer be the
<br>
same person.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;Why would an  android have to go to talk to &quot;Dr. Know&quot; like he did?
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;Surely he would  be able to, if he didn't already have it - purchase
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;and install a  direct interface into the world of all internet knowledge
</em><br>
<p>Unfair! If you know how to depict that on screen in a visually interesting
<br>
manner then you're in the wrong line of work, you should be making movies.
