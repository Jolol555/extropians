<em>&gt; You are absolutely right.  But the margin is small.  The fact that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ALWAYS do it makes it totally consistent and repeatable, which is why they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are capable of correcting it as you noted above.  Their may be bias in their

</em><br>
<p>Yes, but what about the impact? Most people know that their one vote
<br>
will have little impact on an election either way. When the media report
<br>
the democrats are winning by even a small margin, this discourages
<br>
republicans from going and voting, expecting the election to be lost.
<br>
This is why final margins in 'called' elections are almost always larger
<br>
by a greater degree than the margin at the point the election is
<br>
'called' by the media's exit polls than when the media doesn't publicly
<br>
call it: Enough people on the side that is behind figure it is a lost
<br>
cause, and decide not to waste their time voting. Unless the party has
<br>
some means of shipping in voters on a moments notice (or in getting
<br>
people to vote twice, or vote for dead people: All Democrat tactics),
<br>
the act of calling an election before polls close creates a bias in the
<br>
final results. The fact that the media has a bias for Democrats means
<br>
that this will always benefit Democrats more than Republicans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is common in statistics.  A lot of sampling methods turn out to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biased on way or the other.  One theory for this particular bias is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberals are more likely to talk to liberal media, whereas conservatives are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less likely to trust or cooperate with the media.
</em><br>
<p>That's a nice neat way to let the media off the hook. I don't buy it. I
<br>
have personally seen exit pollers ignore people with conservative
<br>
leanings and select people who look 'liberal' to participate in exit
<br>
polls, whether its done by hair length, clothing quality, or skin color
<br>
is irrelevant, it is profile that is at least as wrong as the police
<br>
profiling of blacks that liberals complain of.
