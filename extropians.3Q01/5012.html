From: &quot;Olga Bourlin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:fauxever@sprynet.com?Subject=Re:%20Cultural%20Context%20(Was:%20US%20Science%20Education%20Sucks)&In-Reply-To=&lt;061b01c12e42$86bb8500$9865fea9@D6ZCKK01&gt;">fauxever@sprynet.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm with you, Carlos.  Even though I've been accused of being a nefarious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exponent of &quot;PC&quot; on this list, to tell you the truth I don't understand PC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself.  Having been an uncloseted atheist since I was a teenager, I've
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; exactly been &quot;PC&quot; on this and a score of other issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Charlton Heston (in that sucky Harvard speech that was posted to this list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earlier) talks about PC, but wants to impose another (his own) brand of
</em><br>
PC?
<br>
<em>&gt; PC is a pretty meaningless term, the way I see it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe PC is simply a knee-jerk response used to dismiss people with
</em><br>
certain
<br>
<em>&gt; differing political views.  But what does it really mean?  Without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifics, I don't think it's very useful.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think the term &quot;PC&quot; has a fairly specific meaning, but isn't
<br>
used rigorously by a lot of people who employ the term.  It's also had very
<br>
real impact on Western culture and I'm among those who feel that impact has
<br>
been almost entirely negative.
<br>
<p>As I use the term, &quot;PC&quot; applies to a set of ideas, values and goals
<br>
characterized by:
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt; post-modernist subjectivism
<br>
&lt;&gt; extreme cultural relativism
<br>
&lt;&gt; crypto-marxist condemnation of capitalism
<br>
&lt;&gt; antipathy to:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt; &quot;patriarchy&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt; Anglic culture
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt; exercise of American political and military power in the world outside
<br>
the US
<br>
<p>(Am I missing anything?)
<br>
<p>Now, the problem in the contemporary cultural scene is that this
<br>
constellation of cultural values and vectors is:
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt; almost wholly identified with &quot;the left&quot; (i.e. U.S. left-Democrats and
<br>
Social Democrats everywhere else)
<br>
&lt;&gt; at least in the U.S., became the dominant cultural foundation in academia
<br>
and, to a great extent in influential parts of the media
<br>
&lt;&gt; had a head-start as a fairly self-conscious ideology vis-a-vis the
<br>
reactive &quot;cultural conservative&quot; constellation that developed in response to
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>All of these factors came together -- again in the U.S., certainly -- to
<br>
create a mentality of &quot;siege&quot; in the last two decades among many people who
<br>
perceive &quot;PC&quot; to be a bad thing.  People who came of age in American
<br>
academia in the 1970s and 1980s, especially -- and did not buy into the PC
<br>
cultural paradigm -- correctly perceived that a major element of U.S.
<br>
culture had been essentially &quot;hijacked&quot; by a group of people whose values
<br>
and goals were very different from those who had created the institutions
<br>
that were being overtaken by policies and ideas shaped by &quot;the PC paradigm&quot;.
<br>
<p>Cultural phenomena often tend to operate &quot;out of synch&quot; with each other.
<br>
This seems to be the case with attitudes toward the PC paradigm.
<br>
Significant centers of cultural power have now coalesced around values
<br>
distinct from the PC paradigm, but many participants in those other cultural
<br>
streams still feel isolated and overwhelmed by the PC paradigm.
<br>
Unfortunately, almost all of those new cultural streams are reactive: &quot;The
<br>
Moral Majority,&quot; the nasty white power groups and the like.
<br>
<p>One phenomenon that I believe can be attributed in part to a reaction
<br>
against the inroads made by the PC paradigm into U.S. cultural institutions
<br>
is the renaissance of classical liberalism -- with its modern American label
<br>
of &quot;libertarianism&quot; -- in groups like the Cato Institute, publications like
<br>
Reason magazine, and renewed interest in both the origins of and the modern
<br>
expression of libertarian theory.  This trend is largely an attempt to
<br>
salvage the liberal foundation of Western culture in a way that is not
<br>
reactionary.
<br>
<p>Relative newcomers to the list should be aware that extropianism is, in a
<br>
very general sense, part of this latter cultural phenomena.  Although the
<br>
general cultural impetus that gave rise to the renaissance in liberal
<br>
thought (in the original sense of the word) at the end of the 20th and
<br>
beginning of the 21st centuries may have been reactive (to the seizure by
<br>
the proponents of post-modernism and the PC paradigm of the &quot;commanding
<br>
heights&quot; of cultural institutions), extropianism is NOT a &quot;reactionary&quot;
<br>
philosophy.  Unfortunately, too many people who are steeped in the
<br>
vocabulary of the contemporary polarization of political and cultural life
<br>
into &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; get confused about this.
<br>
<p>The other day I joined in condemnation of material that had come from an
<br>
essentially reactionary web site, pointing out that we have to see the
<br>
context in which something is offered to really understand the CULTURAL
<br>
SIGNIFICANCE of that material.  ASSESSING THE CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE OF
<br>
SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT FROM DETERMINING ITS TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD.  This is a
<br>
fundamentally important distinction that is being missed in almost all the
<br>
discussions about public policy and ethics here lately, from posts about IQ
<br>
tests, to discussion of financing and control of education, to the
<br>
reparations discussion, to the talk about what people mean when they use the
<br>
word &quot;Mexican&quot;.  Interestingly, I think we're seeing a real example of the
<br>
different styles of thought and discourse among &quot;the two cultures&quot;: In the
<br>
sciences, there's really no merit to talking about the cultural significance
<br>
of a proposition; it's either true or false, testable or not, fruitful or
<br>
not.  In the humanities and politics, truth, testability and fruitfulness
<br>
are important, but they aren't the whole story.
<br>
<p>Bearing this distinction in mind -- and the cultural history and context
<br>
discussed above -- might make for higher quality discussion here.
