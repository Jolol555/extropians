<p>In order to understand Islam, you must also understand the role of the
<br>
Koran and its interpretation. It is very different from the relationship
<br>
of the Bible to western society, and just finding quotes doesn't even
<br>
approach the complexity of muslim theology/law - in many ways they are
<br>
the same thing, while at the same time having clearly delineated domains
<br>
of applicability, a long epistemological tradition and methods of
<br>
resolving issues. See
<br>
<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/law/shariahintroduction.html">http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/law/shariahintroduction.html</a> for just a hint
<br>
of the complexity. Just as most Christians would say that their religion
<br>
has a basic prohibition against killing even when confronted with the
<br>
stories about ethnic cleansing in the Bible (explaining that the Old
<br>
Testament was superceeded by the new), Islam has similar layers of
<br>
re-interpretation and ethical praxis which makes just reading the Koran
<br>
somewhat misleading.
