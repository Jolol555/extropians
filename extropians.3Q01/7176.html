From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Re%20:%20Libertarian%20viewpoint%20on%20&quot;The%20new%20war&quot;?&In-Reply-To=&lt;008b01c141fe$8f42c1a0$055d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; The risk is that we get a lot of snooping that is technically legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thanks to legislation passed in a panic (by politicians fearful of jets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falling on their own heads!), but which is not done for the reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intended.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's right, and if that risk of snooping becomes real via new laws and
<br>
more invasion of privacy, then the terrorists have won -- they've destroyed
<br>
the freedom that has made the US a prosperous and safe society. So the
<br>
Libertarian position (and extropian as well) is to find other ways to defeat
<br>
terrorism without sacrificing freedom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a libertarian and minarchist, my view of the current events is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding and punishing those responsible is actually the job of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government - one of the few things it is intended for. It should have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right legal powers to do this, and do it in a way that helps the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests of the citizens. Nothing else. This means that 1) extending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal powers after a terrorist attack should only be done if there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compelling evidence that they will be necessary and useful in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future,
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and those legal powers should be temporary, being rescinded when no
<br>
longer necessary and useful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) hurting innocents in the process of finding and punishing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must be kept minimal. It is actually ethically better that a villain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; escapes that you (or your government, acting on your behalf) kills an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innocent.
</em><br>
<p>That depends on whether or not the escape tends to encourage other villains to
<br>
perpetrate similar crimes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Privacy might not be a sacred primary value, but there needs to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symmetry in power between the government and its citizens. If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government is given the right to snoop, then the accountability of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government must also be ratcheted up. This is not being done right now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite the reverse.
</em><br>
<p>That's the problem correctly identified by Ronald Reagan, who pointed out that
<br>
governments (and especially bureaucracies) expand to solve new problems, but
<br>
do not contract in response to their own obsolescence.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
