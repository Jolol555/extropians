<p>It's hard to believe that a nutty group like this could have so
<br>
many members.  Of course we don't have any proof that they are 55,000.
<br>
Rael could have just made that number up.  Maybe he's only got a couple
<br>
hundred.  That would make mores sense.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/010709/usnews/clone.htm">http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/010709/usnews/clone.htm</a> describes
<br>
problems Rael and the other cloning group are having with the U.S.
<br>
Despite the lack of U.S. laws about human cloning the FDA is giving them
<br>
a hard time and doing everything it can to stop them.  &quot;There's a timeout
<br>
in force,&quot; says an FDA official, emphasis apparently on the &quot;force&quot;.
