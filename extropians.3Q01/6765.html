Subject: TERRORISM: Is genocide the logical solution?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know that by raising this issue, I am going to take a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of flak.  But that is the purpose of the Extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list -- to engage in rational discussion of ideas -- even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if those ideas may seem repulsive at first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those of us who believe in the extropian/transhumanist perspectives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect that the world is likely to undergo a significant adjustment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of its perspective over the next 10-30 years.  These will include
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such developments as artificial intelligence, molecular nanotechnology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the elimination of aging and death and the feasibility of uploading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our minds into much more robust hardware.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We also know, from calculations that I and Eliezer (independently)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have done, that the annual cost between where we are now and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full manifestation of what we expect is feasible is of the order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 50 million lives per year.  That is approximately 10,000 times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the number of lives lost in the WTC attacks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to the CIA world fact book, the population of Afganistan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is ~25 million people.  In contrast the population of the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is 280+ million people and the world is 6+ billion.  It is highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlikely that the population of Afganistan will make a significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribution to the development of the advanced technological era
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we expect.  In fact their ongoing existence seems likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directed towards negatively impacting that development.  To the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent that the activities of individuals in Afganistan, or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support of such individuals by the leaders or population at large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delay the development of the era we anticipate, we can assign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a cost to it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From my perspective the analysis is relatively simple.  If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population of Afganistan, or the people supported by them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delay the onset of an era of advanced technological capabilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by 6 months or more, the value of their lives is negative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From a rational position, *if* the case can be made that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afgani position &amp; politics is likely to result in the diversion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of resources and delay the development of the technologies we anticipate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developing by more than 6 months, then a plan of genocide to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bury the country in rubble seems justified.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is this feasible?  It would appear to be the case.  100 Minutemann III
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ICBMs could launch 300+ Ktons each at Afganistan.  This roughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; translates to over 1 ton TNT/person.  While this is unlikely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kill everyone, it is likely to knock the population back to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sub-cave-person level and make a large negative impact on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feasibility of staging terrorist activities from that country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course the downside will be in the likelyhood that it may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in promoting individuals and countries in developing similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capabilities.  But of course once the line has been crossed, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are relatively few barriers towards the use of nuclear weapons to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue knocking down potential terrorists as needs require.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

While we are at it, I suppose we ought to figure out the likelihood posts
<br>
such as yours might cause a severe backlash against the transhumanist
<br>
movement. I guess if your post puts the movement behind even a few moments
<br>
then we might have to think whether it is rational to take you out. Now
<br>
where's my calculator?
