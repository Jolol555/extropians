<em>&gt; The man with the highest IQ ever may have been a fellow by name of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; known even though he took many IQ tests, the tests were just not up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the task, he was off the charts. Abraham Sterling, director of New York
</em><br>
<em>&gt; City's Aptitude Testing Institute said &quot; he easily had an IQ between 250

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what did this &quot;prodigious intellect&quot; accomplish in his 46 years?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He wrote a book about streetcar transfers, that's about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems high IQ and genius are not quite synonymous.
</em><br>
<p>Depends on how complex your streetcar system is, though, don't you
<br>
think? Such a tome would be highly useful for queueing and switching
<br>
theory, eh?
