THE PORNOGRAPHY OF COMPASSION AND THE COST OF EMPIRESeptember 18, 2001
<br>
<p>THE PORNOGRAPHY OF COMPASSION AND THE COST OF EMPIRE
<br>
by Thomas Fleming
<br>
<p>from <a href="http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/News/NewsTF091801.htm">http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/News/NewsTF091801.htm</a>
<br>
<p>It has been a few days since our morning coffees were interrupted by news of
<br>
an airliner crashing into the World Trade Center, several hours of non-stop
<br>
replays of planes crashing, skyscrapers collapsing, trapped office workers
<br>
jumping out of windows to their death, countless hours of cell phone calls
<br>
from doomed stewardesses and passengers, of human-interest interviews with
<br>
hysterical survivors and sobbing relatives, two full days of Peter and Tom
<br>
and Dan and Barbara and Shep talking constantly without saying anything more
<br>
significant than &quot;How did it feel,&quot; or &quot;Senseless and tragic.&quot;
<br>
<p>If we did not already know that there was something wrong in our national
<br>
character, our response to the events of September 11 would be enough to
<br>
convince any sane person: melodramatic commiseration, bewilderment, panic.
<br>
Many pundits and politicians are already talking about nuclear strikes
<br>
against Afghanistan (though the Israelis prefer Iraq), but this boldness is
<br>
hardly matched by the federal agencies that have kept most flights on the
<br>
ground for fear of a second round.
<br>
<p>What are the stark facts?  That probably Islamic terrorists, belonging to
<br>
organizations that routinely kill innocent people and have sworn an oath
<br>
against the &quot;Christian&quot; United States, succeeded in taking over several
<br>
airplanes and crashed three of them into three buildings, causing the death
<br>
of some thousands of people. It is a terrible thing to happen, for the
<br>
victims and their families, for the people living in New York and
<br>
Washington, and it raises serious questions, both about the competence of
<br>
U.S. intelligence and the wisdom of our foreign policy--questions that no
<br>
one either in the media or in government is likely to address.  But, and I
<br>
do not mean this cynically at all, 5 to 10,000 dead people is not the end of
<br>
the world for the global economic community that is absorbing the
<br>
sovereignty of national states.  The very least that we can say is that
<br>
death is the price of empire.
<br>
<p>Human life cannot be reduced to a set of statistics, but it is important to
<br>
keep things in proportion.  Something like 8 to 10,000 people die every day
<br>
in America, and that figure does not include the approximately 4,000 babies
<br>
killed by abortion. Roughly 150,000 people die every day around the world.
<br>
Perhaps 40 to 50,000 die every year in the United States in traffic
<br>
accidents, but we do not go into national shock for them.  Of course,
<br>
traffic fatalities are accidental, and the terrorist strike in New York and
<br>
Washington, D.C., was cold-blooded murder.  The President says this is a
<br>
war.  If that is true, the first obvious fact to note is that men die in a
<br>
war--5,000 Americans soldiers died at Antietam.  But soldiers are not the
<br>
only ones who die during war: How many civilians died when the allies
<br>
unleashed firebombs on Dresden or when the United States dropped nuclear
<br>
missiles on Hiroshima and Nagasaki?
<br>
<p>We speak so glibly of &quot;terrorism&quot; without reflecting on the obvious fact
<br>
that throughout history, most terrorism has been carried out by governments
<br>
and not by private conspiracies.  Terrorism is the attack on the lives of
<br>
non-combatants in order to demoralize a people and its leaders and change
<br>
their policies.  What was the Dresden firebombing, which killed 40,000
<br>
civilians, but an attempt to persuade the German people to repudiate their
<br>
government?  The object of the attacks on New York and Washington was not to
<br>
kill people but to demoralize our people and our government, and although
<br>
American businessmen are responding to the challenge with their customary
<br>
zest and courage, the American government is proving itself both morally and
<br>
intellectually incapable of understanding, much less dealing with the
<br>
crisis.
<br>
<p>The politicians and the commentators say they are shocked and outraged by
<br>
this callous disregard of human life.  But these same people, not long ago,
<br>
were justifying the U.S. bombing of civilians in Iraq and Yugoslavia and the
<br>
U.S. embargo of Iraq that has killed over 1.5 million non-combatants, and to
<br>
make matters worse, prominent politicians are calling for a no-holds barred
<br>
attack on nations--including their women and children--that harbor
<br>
terrorists. The cost in human life of Serbs killed in the NATO attack was a
<br>
mere 1,500, but 1,500 out of the Serb population of 8 million represents
<br>
roughly 20 to 40 times the maximum death rate projected for the World Trade
<br>
Center and the Pentagon.  You can't have it both ways.  If generic human
<br>
life is precious, that means the lives of Iraqis and Serbs and Afghans are
<br>
precious, not just the lives of Americans.
<br>
<p>It is precisely U.S. policies toward Muslim peoples that has got us to this
<br>
point: We support their enemy in the Middle East, while pampering Muslims
<br>
everywhere else in the world where they are practicing genocide against
<br>
Christians.  Osama bin Laden is not the problem.  The problem is an
<br>
international religion that defines itself by its hatred of Christianity and
<br>
that elevates the terrorist to the pinnacle of sainthood.  I do not think we
<br>
should be demonizing Muslims, but I do think we have to acknowledge that as
<br>
a group, to the extent that they are sincere in their faith, they are our
<br>
enemy.
<br>
<p>And what an enemy!  While we are hyping ourselves into hormonal hysteria
<br>
over the death of people we do not know, they are training for the next
<br>
assault.  As Srdja Trifkovic pointed out, imagine what sort of will these
<br>
terrorists possess, to spend months in the fleshpots of Florida with only
<br>
one thought: How to die killing the most Americans.  No group of communists
<br>
could possibly have been entrusted with such a mission.  For so many
<br>
intelligent men to will their own deaths is proof, living and dying proof,
<br>
both of their resolve and of the power of their religion.
<br>
<p>I do not envy them their contempt for human life.  Christianity teaches the
<br>
contrary message, the value of human life and the preciousness of human soul
<br>
s.  And, although Christianity is a universal faith, it does not (unlike
<br>
libertarianism) teach us to despise our neighbors and fellow-countrymen as
<br>
nothing more than buyers and sellers in a planetary economic system.  The
<br>
thousands of Americans who died so terribly in the WTC and the Pentagon are
<br>
important to us, not merely because they are generically human but because
<br>
they are American.  Unfortunately, they were working in a symbol of a global
<br>
system that seeks not to transcend but to destroy all petty loyalties to
<br>
nations and religions.
<br>
<p>No, the problem is not Osama bin Laden or even U.S. foreign policy in the
<br>
Middle East.  The larger threats are represented by insurgent Islam and by
<br>
an American leadership that views other nations and traditions as only so
<br>
much land to be homesteaded. The events of September represent one battle in
<br>
an ongoing war between two systems that seek to take over the earth:  Islam
<br>
and the post-Christian religion that leftists see as a planetary state and
<br>
&quot;conservatives&quot; see as benevolent American hegemony.
<br>
<p>The temptation is to make scapegoats of all the Muslims and Arabs (including
<br>
Christian Arabs) or blame the Israelis for getting us into this mess.  Mobs
<br>
have attacked Muslims on the street, and in Australia, the yahoos burned
<br>
down a Lebanese church.  What an irony for the Lebanese, to have escaped
<br>
Islamic persecution in Lebanon only to be persecuted as Muslims in a
<br>
Christian country.  If Christianity has anything to teach us, it is that
<br>
people are not &quot;symbols&quot; but human beings, and the fact that a human being
<br>
may work for George Soros in New York or live in Iraq or Afghanistan does
<br>
not provide the slightest justification for murdering him.  If we are to
<br>
draw any lessons from these past few days, it should begin with a national
<br>
self-examination of what we think we are doing in the world.  As our local
<br>
talk show host Chris Bowman said amid all the rejoicing the day the Berlin
<br>
Wall came down, &quot;If America is now the only remaining superpower, it means
<br>
we are the only remaining target for every terrorist group that is
<br>
dissatisfied with the way the world is going.&quot;
<br>
<p>September 11, 2001, is a graver crisis than December 7, 1941.  Of course FDR
<br>
did his best to get us into the war, but once we are attacked by Japan and
<br>
war was declared by Germany, the course of action was very plain.  Today,
<br>
however, we do not precisely know who the enemy is, and if we choose to
<br>
respond in kind, we may be facing more terrible acts of terrorism within the
<br>
United States.  More than rumor suggests that Islamic terrorists have
<br>
stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons.  Any coherent strategy would
<br>
include: 1) a courageous PR demonstration by American political leaders
<br>
going to New York and facing possible assassination, coupled with an
<br>
immediate return to normalcy; 2) a crackdown on Muslims entering the country
<br>
and a review of all non-citizens in America whose countries of origin are
<br>
the source of Islamic terrorism--this includes Pakistan, Syria, Egypt, and
<br>
Saudi Arabia and not just Iraq and Afghanistan; 3) a tough new policy in the
<br>
Middle East forcing the Sharon administration to withdraw all Israeli
<br>
settlers from occupied lands and return to Israel's original borders; 4) a
<br>
swift and violent response against the terrorists and their state
<br>
sponsors--but only once we have actually determined the facts.
<br>
<p>What we will do, in fact, will be the opposite.  We will rush to the support
<br>
of Israel without doing anything about the threat of Muslims resident in the
<br>
United States; we will refuse to impose a policy of ethnic profiling, but we
<br>
will strip ordinary Americans of their civil liberties; and we will probably
<br>
kill thousands of civilians who had nothing to do with the attacks.  Welcome
<br>
to the Bush family's New World Order.
<br>
<p>If we are to be an empire, so be it.  That choice is not up to me--and
<br>
probably not up to any of us.  But if the United States continues to walk
<br>
down this road, we had better throw away the crying towels and tear up all
<br>
those human-interest stories the networks are so fond of.  In the
<br>
cost-benefit calculation of empires, the death of 5 to 10,000 of our
<br>
fellow-citizens (an outmoded concept) counts for nothing.
