<p>
&nbsp;I'll reply here to all of the posts that were made in response to my letter
<br>
to NPR about Duncan Moon's report on Islam this morning.  And, in the
<br>
interest of economy (Newton knows we all need less text to read right now!)
<br>
I'll skip quotes, since the tenor of the replies to the list all seemed to
<br>
be similar, i.e. to the effect that my letter unfairly singled out Islam.
<br>
&nbsp;First, my credentials as an &quot;irreligious&quot; person needn't be established
<br>
here, as long-time subscribers know, so there can be no suspicion that I am
<br>
a secret opponent to Islam on the grounds of being adherent of another
<br>
faith.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Second, having read the Bible, I'm well aware that one can find a lot of
<br>
bloody-minded stuff in it - although primarily in the Old Testament.  My
<br>
personal scholarship isn't focusing on *comparative* religion right now, so
<br>
if anyone can offer up some bloody-minded quotes from the NT, I'd be happy
<br>
to see them.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Third, it's a historical fact that Christianity has been largely &quot;tamed&quot; in
<br>
the sense that - outside of a few notable localized exceptions like N.
<br>
Ireland, there are very few religiously-inspired wars being *initiated* by
<br>
Christians *on the basis of religion* these days.  Again, I'm open to seeing
<br>
examples to the contrary.  (There is a religious component to the Balkan
<br>
violence, but it's just as much simple ethnic tribalistic bigotry as
<br>
religious hatred.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Fourth, there is absolutely no question in my mind that there is a primary
<br>
component of religious motivation in the 911 attacks and in the continuing
<br>
threat that Al Quaida and its co-conspirators continue to present to the
<br>
civilized world.  As I've said already, there are certainly non-religious
<br>
causes for conflict in and arising out of the Islamic world, from the US
<br>
foreign policy decision to lie down with dogs in opposition to the Soviets
<br>
in Afghanistan, to the intractable problem of Palestinian nationalism.  But
<br>
there is *no* component of US foreign policy error in the bloody violence of
<br>
Islamic fundamentalists in Algeria, central Africa or Egypt, where wholly
<br>
internal struggles are going on by them against their own domestic &quot;satans&quot;,
<br>
i.e. non-fundamentalists and non-Muslims.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;So, yes, I'm singling out Islam. The Islamic world needs to do what Europe
<br>
did over the last 300 years.  It needs to tame its religion.  The sooner,
<br>
the better.
