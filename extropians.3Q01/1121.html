It has been a while since I read about Cyc but as I understand
<br>
it Cyc might very well understand &quot;ball&quot; as a &quot;spherical object
<br>
generally used in a variety of games and having various
<br>
properties depending on the game&quot; and &quot;red&quot; as the apparent
<br>
color of the ball and the relationship of red to other colors. 
<br>
But these are facts, definitions and relationships that are
<br>
part, I think, of what the project includes in their
<br>
ontologies.  
<br>
<p>Do they not go at least this far?
