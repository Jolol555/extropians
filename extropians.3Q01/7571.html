</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aluminum is tough and ductile, and the pressure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differential is only 14.7 psi. If the bullet rips a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long gash, as it penetrates the outer skin at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shallow angle, combined with strong (~700mph) airflow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forces impinging on the rough edges of the &quot;exit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wound&quot;, then perhaps, a large blow-out might occur.
</em><br>
<p>How do windshield cracks form (and why do many windshields fail as a
<br>
result)?
<br>
<p>They have a small nick from a bouncing rock on them, then the small
<br>
cracks produced slowly creep across the windshield from heating and
<br>
cooling of the sun and precipitation, as well as the very minor low
<br>
pressure stresses of 60 mph winds and ground vibrations.
<br>
<p>Sharp angles in any material act to focus stress at the apex of the
<br>
angle, and cracks are simply highly acute sharp angles in such
<br>
materials. This is the same reason why aircraft makers discovered in the
<br>
Comet airliner crashes that square windows focused stresses at the
<br>
corners, which is why all aircraft windows are now round.
<br>
<p>In the event of a bullet rupturing an aircraft pressure cabin, it would
<br>
peel outward 3-10 flanges of metal in its passing. It won't just punch a
<br>
round hole. The stresses of the wind outside passing at 600 mph
<br>
laterally across the hole, combined with the escaping gasses will all be
<br>
focused on the narrowest parts of the cracks between the flanges of
<br>
metal, causing the cracks to spread outward rather quickly.
<br>
<p>If you shoot through a window, only the window will open up, but that is
<br>
enough to suck out anyone within 2-6 feet without any real trouble. If
<br>
you shoot through the wall of the cabin, a much larger hole will result,
<br>
going a few feet to each adjacent rib and stringer in the airframe, and
<br>
perhaps beyond until pressure equalizes. If the plane does not slow down
<br>
rather quickly, the skin will continue to peel backward over time.
