<p>There isn't any need for that sort of communication to do

something like this.  Separate groups of terrorist, one group

per plane, with preset targets and syncrhonized watches would be
<br>
sufficient.

</em><br>
<p>Well, an investigation in how these planes were taken over is
<br>
certainly called for.  I wonder if various types of gas that
<br>
could knock out everyone not protected are guarded against
<br>
sufficiently by airport security.  That is one way I could think
<br>
of, off the top of my head, that this could be done without
<br>
firearms being on board.

</em><br>
<p>Precisely what incompetency do you have in mind?  That the
<br>
government is not watching all of us twenty four hours a day
<br>
with full control over all technology if we start acting in
<br>
really aberrant ways?
