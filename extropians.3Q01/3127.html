<em>&gt; &gt; Insight is the elimination of the ignorance which is the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An odd word to describe this; but all right, I understand that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are describing the momentary feeling when one's understanding and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceptions change.  Very well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Insight dispels that very center.  With the ignorance, perception is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not possible.  It's blindness in a way. What next? I am an ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human, with all my animal instincts, pleasure and pain and reward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and punishment and so on.  I hear you [Eugene] say this, and I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what you are saying has some kind of reason, logic and order.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; makes sense as far as we can see... Then how am I to have reason in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; my life?  How am I to bring it about?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who can say for sure?  But I'll put my amateurish two cents in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our instincts (definitely including our emotions) foment in most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of us commendable rational processes of finding what's so and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what's not.  Sometimes, of course, the results of this inquiry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not welcome.  One has uncomfortable feelings of dissonance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incompleteness, and lack of harmony, and some people simply shut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the door on those feelings and thoughts at once.  We, generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speaking, are not such people.  So what we can do is carefully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and repeatedly give internal voice to those unpleasant conclusions.
</em><br>
<p>Or perhaps logic and reason is not the end and be all of ways to
<br>
fruitfully understand and make wise choices.  There is not an
<br>
either/or here.  Nor is facing dissonance an automatic guarantee
<br>
of any virtue except not flinching from the unpleasant.  It is
<br>
certainly not a reliable sign one is on the right track.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my own case, to take a recent example, I must say over and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over, &quot;The Fred Reed piece had some definite racist passages.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I am comfortable saying that, I can then proceed to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more difficult abridgment, &quot;The Fred Reed piece was racist.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now after I say it a few times, it gets a lot easier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In just this way, we can employ our rationality to help ourselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; move forward.  In this way, we can allow, as you put it, reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into our lives.
</em><br>
<p>Do you really think this is an example of anything highly
<br>
admirable, especially of an example of the benefits of reason? 
<br>
How so?  I don't get it.  Honest examination leads to the
<br>
conclusion for sure but was it really at all difficult to do?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P.S. Standing challenge to any of you liberals out there:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; top that!  Confess how you have articulated to yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something as explosive as &quot;Fred Reed's piece is racist&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but with the shoe on the other foot, and how you, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though it was exceedingly painful, had to give huge aid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and comfort to your ideological opponents.  (P.P.S.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think any of them will.)
</em><br>
<p>I don't think in terms of &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot;.  But I am
<br>
one who has embraced many intellectually, emotionally,
<br>
psychologically and spiritually painful positions in my life
<br>
when I believed that honesty and being fully alive required it. 
<br>
How could I do anything else when I know what dishonesty brings
<br>
from trying that all together too many times?  
<br>
<p>I don't have &quot;ideological opponents&quot;.
