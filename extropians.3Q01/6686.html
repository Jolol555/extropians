<p>Perhaps I'm just stupid, but how?  AFAIK Israel doesn't include
<br>
access to Middle Eastern oil among its priorities.  Israel has more
<br>
than enough other military/diplomatic concerns, and appears to have
<br>
written off the region as a source for itself entirely, importing
<br>
from Mexico, Norway, and the UK says
<br>
<a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/israel.html">http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/israel.html</a>.  The US hasn't used
<br>
Israel as a base from which to attack countries that refuse to sell
<br>
or raise the price of oil.  Is there an implicit threat to do so?
<br>
If so, why didn't we when OPEC was strong, or during the gulf war?
<br>
Israel isn't even all that close the the main oil fields.  Jordan
<br>
and a bunch of desert lies between.  The Persian Gulf offers much
<br>
better access should the US wish to force producers to sell at a
<br>
price we set.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; oil is the objective, it'd be simpler to pay off/befriend Saudi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Arabia and Kuwait than to ally with Israel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They are not reliable allies.
</em><br>
<p>Not a problem.  They don't all have to be friendly at the same time.
<br>
I'd guess among Persian Gulf area oil producers, Kuwait is currently
<br>
most friendly to the US, Iraq the least.  Doesn't matter if that
<br>
gets shuffled.  It's all oil.  If oilless allies in the region help
<br>
somehow, there's also Turkey.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Israel is able to defend itself quite nicely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't believe it's ever had to defend itself without US support.
</em><br>
<p>They've mostly managed on their own.  What has the US provided
<br>
apart from money and intelligence?  (We provide hardware to everyone
<br>
in the region.)  US and Israeli troops have never fought together.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why would all of the Persian Gulf region countries stop selling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; oil unless we really, really pissed them off?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They wouldn't have to merely stop. They could create major problems by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply raising prices. Bin Laden has stated in a 1997 interview with ABC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; news that it is his intent, should he ever gain the power to do so, to raise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the price of oil substantially.
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<p>Bin Laden doesn't have the power.  He doesn't control Afganistan,
<br>
let alone the entire Middle East.  He'd have to bring down every
<br>
existing government in the Middle East to obtain that power.  The
<br>
only thing the US has to fear regarding access to oil is that Bin
<br>
Laden's ideology overtakes all of the major oil producing states.
<br>
That isn't going to happen without plenty of help from the US.
