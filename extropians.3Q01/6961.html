<em>&gt;From: Mike Lorrey &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20TERRORISM:%20Is%20genocide%20the%20logical%20solution?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200109172315.f8HNFFm22605@pheidippides.md.chalmers.se&gt;">mlorrey@datamann.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What is the population of Afghanistan? Ten million? How much time does
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it take for that many people in the world to die of other causes? 6
</em><br>
<em>&gt;months? A year? If the actions of those responsible for terrorism delay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the achievement of immortality by enough time that the number of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who die instead of becoming immortal exceeds that of those who stand in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;its way, then from a PURELY rational, cost/benefit point of view,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Robert's statement is entirely justified, but only if such action
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actually does result in saving that time.
</em><br>
<p>How would you actually know you saved time? I can't imagine any way
<br>
in which you might honestly show the savings will occur. If you indeed
<br>
possess such a capacity for foreseeing the cost/benefit balances of
<br>
so massive and complex actions as a genocide would have on the global
<br>
socio-economic-cultural system, and do it to the point where you can
<br>
actually show the saving in actual months associated with your actions,
<br>
then I will print this post and eat it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I know that this is a rather disgusting thing to say.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe for other readers here it is disgusting, I have a stronger stomach
<br>
than that. For me it's simply lunatic, and I would expect your actions to
<br>
wreck the advancement processes so much as to end up with human stagnation
<br>
or even extinction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In positions of leadership, people always have to make life and death
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decisions.
</em><br>
<p>Of course they have. And they tend to blunder as much as they hit right.
<br>
I'm very unconvinced you have either the information-gathering tools,
<br>
the correct models, or the predictive capabilities to actually defend
<br>
such things as &quot;genocide for cost/benefit rationality&quot;. And I would
<br>
also expect that if/when you acquire all the tools, models and capabilities,
<br>
you will find your cost/benefit rationality tells you you are wrong, and
<br>
what Eliezer posted is more or less the reason why you were wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In the case of terrorism delaying immortality: if you kill fewer people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than are saved by the resultant acceleration of the achievement of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;immortality, you are rationally justified. All that is left is a moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;debate over whether sins of commission are more wrong than sins of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;omission.
</em><br>
<p>I say that in your cost/benefit rationality you are compounding both
<br>
sins: committing genocide, and ommitting to account for the real
<br>
cost/benefits involved in your commission.
<br>
<p>Carlos
