<em>&gt; This last fact of the history of the evolution of Islamic culture is one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that has driven the despair I am coming to feel about the possibility that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can hope to see a milder form of Islam develop any time soon.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem is the totalitarian conception of shariah (protected by the doctrine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;bida&quot; or *the sin of innovation*, much more than the violent roots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islam.
</em><br>
<p>One site I read while reading up on Islam suggested that the islamic
<br>
concept of history is not so much progress as an unfolding and
<br>
re-expression of an already existing fixed truth. It suggested that
<br>
Kaaba is a good symbol - a fixed solid cube, which we might decorate and
<br>
circulate around, but is itself not changing.
<br>
<p>This kind of concept is of course antithetical to transhumanism in its
<br>
deeper sense as a seeking to change the fundaments of being human (and
<br>
the universe). It doesn't mean there has to be antagonism between
<br>
transhumanists and muslims, since we both can agree to disagree on this,
<br>
but it is a problem. Transhumanism &quot;light&quot; like seeking longevity,
<br>
improved standards of living and enhanced intelligence doesn't seem to
<br>
be a sticking point, since it would just be evaluated on its own
<br>
benefits from an islamic point of view. 
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; At any rate, I think that effort to try to develop memetic engineering tools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for moderating Islam is well spent, even though the task seems to be *much*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more difficult than a similar enterprise applied to Christianity.  Mohammed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was one sly fellow, building a much more robust memetic immune system into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the basic concepts of Islam.  It's a much simpler and more robust over-all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construct than Christianity.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I have always admired it for that. In computer language terms, it
<br>
is a far more clean implementation of monotheism than Christianity and
<br>
Judaism. 
<br>
<p>I guess one place to look for moderating factors is the liberal arab
<br>
states like Tunisia, and see what thinkers there have come up with.
<br>
They are far more likely than us to have noticed or come up with good
<br>
moderating ideas.
