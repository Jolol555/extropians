(Oops, I sent this out under wong heading, sorry for the duplication.)
<br>
<p>I'm glad this subject came up on the list because in working on the FAQ,
<br>
we need to better determine and explain what a transhuman is by today's
<br>
standards.  While I give credit to FM for his early definition and I
<br>
think that it should be respected and acknowledged, it seems that many of
<br>
us have different concepts on how we define transhuman.
<br>
<p>In replying to the posts, I gave a lot of thought to more than just the
<br>
obvious differences in interpretation.  I also considered my
<br>
background and both the professions and interests of others who have
<br>
responded.  While it stands to reason that there will be fuzzy areas
<br>
and even cross-overs between human/transhuman/posthuman, and there will
<br>
also be some subjective views based on our own unique areas of study and
<br>
interest, it would be best in light of Reason's comments that we don't
<br>
dilute the original definition too much.
<br>
<p>Today, I think Max More's philosophical understanding of the transhuman
<br>
period is beneficial.  It parallels my own in many ways, but we
<br>
still differ on several points pertaining to the transition period but
<br>
agree on others (he's a fine sounding board); that I'd like to bring up
<br>
at some point this weekend.  While I never fully agreed with FM, I
<br>
fully understand why we need to be clear in developing a more
<br>
finely-tuned understanding of the word. I'd also like to include Damien
<br>
Broderick' because it was Damien who wrote about transhuman some years
<br>
ago also.  While FM wrote in an ideological context, Damien in a
<br>
science fiction context,  myself in a cultural context, Max coverer
<br>
these ideas in his dissertation and afterwards very 
<br>
comprehensively.
<br>
<p>In the FAQ (Transhumanist) that I am working on, I think its
<br>
important  to include a number of ideas as well as agree on a
<br>
substantial representation of where we are today.

<br>
<em>&gt;From an essay I wrote some years ago:
</em><br>
<p>&quot;T.S. Eliot wrote about the risks of the human journey in becoming
<br>
enlightened or illuminated as expressed by the character Julia in his
<br>
play &quot;The Cocktail Party&quot; _The Complete Poems and Plays 1909
<br>
- 1950_, published by Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc., New York.
<br>
&quot;You and I don't know the process by which the human is
<br>
Transhumanised: what do we know of the kind of suffering they must
<br>
undergo on the way of illumination?&quot;
<br>
<p>Undoubtedly, there may be elements of angst in our evolutionary journey
<br>
of becoming transhuman and eventually posthuman, but not be the type of
<br>
suffering that many humans need to assuage the fear of having too much or
<br>
being too successful. Contrarily, the suffering transhumans experience
<br>
comes from the constraints of a short life span and the crippling nature
<br>
of death, not of the journey to enlightenment.
<br>
<p>The actual concept of transhuman as an evolutionary transition was first
<br>
expressed by FM-2030. His trilogy, _Up-Wingers, Telespheres_ and
<br>
_Optimism One_ (1973) constitutes the beginnings of the
<br>
transhumanist philosophy, as well as his contributing final chapter in _
<br>
Woman, Year 2000_ (1972) Ideas about humanity and evolution were
<br>
explored by Julian Huxley in his writings on evolutionary humanism in the
<br>
book &lt;i&gt;Evolution: The Modern Synthesis_ (1942) and Teilhard de
<br>
Chardin in &lt;i&gt;The Future of Man_ (1959). In 1966, FM-2030 (formerly,
<br>
F.M. Esfandiary) outlined an evolutionary transhuman future while
<br>
teaching &quot;New Concepts of the Human&quot; at the New School for
<br>
Social Research, New York City. Abraham Maslow referred to transhumans in
<br>
_Toward a Psychology of Being_, (1968), Robert Ettinger also
<br>
referred to transhumans in _Man into Superman_ (1972), my own
<br>
writings in the &quot;Transhuman Statement&quot; (TransArt) (1982), and
<br>
by Damien Broderick in _The Judas Mandala_ (1982). The ideas of man,
<br>
or the humans overcoming their limits has been a life-long desire of of
<br>
humanity through civilization. Today, we have the technological tools to
<br>
begin overcoming human limits. But this is not all. We need to develop
<br>
the mindset for which to explore the new technologies. FM-2030 used the
<br>
words &quot;multi-track&quot; to break though single-track thinking.
<br>
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, De Bono, William Calvin and Carl Sagan were also
<br>
creative thinking strategists who worked toward developing, each in his
<br>
separate discipline, ways to encourage new thinking patterns for the
<br>
human mind.
<br>
<p>The _Reader’s Digest Great Encyclopedia Dictionary_ (1966) defines
<br>
&quot;transhuman&quot; as meaning &quot;surpassing; transcending;
<br>
beyond&quot;. In the _Webster’s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary_
<br>
(1983), &quot;transhuman&quot; is defined as meaning
<br>
&quot;superhuman,&quot; and &quot;transhumanize,&quot; meaning &quot;to
<br>
elevate or transform to something beyond what is human&quot;. Yet, these
<br>
are not a complete and contemporary meanings.Today, we refer to
<br>
transhuman as meaning an evolutionary transition from being biologically
<br>
human toward our merger with technology, as set forth by FM.
<br>
<p>FM defined transhuman as &quot;a new kind of being crystallizing from the
<br>
monumental breakthroughs of the late twentieth century. ... the earliest
<br>
manifestations of a new evolutionary being.&quot; Later he authored the
<br>
book _Are You A Transhuman?_ (1989).
<br>
<p>Transhumanism has a slightly different beginning. Julian Huxley’s book
<br>
written in 1956, _New Bottles For New Wine_, contains the essay
<br>
&quot;TRANSHUMANISM&quot; which sets out to explain how humans must
<br>
establish a better environment for themselves. He also alludes to a new
<br>
species that the human might eventually become. The difference in
<br>
Huxley’s transhumanism and Max More’s transhumanism is that Huxley states
<br>
&quot;man remaining man but transcending himself.&quot; Transhumanism as
<br>
defined by Max More explains the overcoming of human limits and the
<br>
transformation from being human to becoming posthuman. Although Huxley
<br>
had a vision of a possible future for humanity, he single-tracked the
<br>
future when he saw man remaining man.
<br>
<p>How did the memetic spreading of transhumanity begin? What started as
<br>
futurist ideas taught by FM at the New School University eventually
<br>
became evolving ideas held by thousands of individuals linking across the
<br>
Internet. FM has an enormous following of individuals fascinated by his
<br>
particular visionary views. At the University of California Los Angeles,
<br>
FM brought together hundreds to discuss ways to &quot;flash foward&quot;
<br>
to the coming decades. Transhumanist Arts reached out to culture with
<br>
electronic arts and images of space and evolution. The cyberculture
<br>
became the most fertile breeding ground for people interested in
<br>
exploring new tools. Extropy Institute spearheaded extropian transhuman
<br>
influence academically, in print and throughout the Internet. The Extro
<br>
Conferences, meetings, parties, on-line debates, and documentaries have
<br>
continued to get the idea of the transhuman to the public.
<br>
<p>While the scientific community embraced the new concepts in human
<br>
evolution, the art community focused on exploring new tool of electronics
<br>
to enhance our senses and develop alternative realities. Soon
<br>
evolutionary memes such as extropy, nanotechnology, biotech, A-Life, AI,
<br>
SI, VR, transhuman, automorph, extreme-life, avatar, singularity, and
<br>
thoughts of new types of sexuality and genders arose. Like meme spores
<br>
infiltrating culture with words well known in the scientific world,
<br>
artists have been exploring the ideas of evolution and giving them the
<br>
art of life.
<br>
<p>Transhuman history is comprised of knowledge of events transforming our
<br>
species, and in particular, of our creativity, science and technology.
<br>
<em>&gt;From the earliest plebeian cultures—to the advanced complexities of
</em><br>
social systems—the future has been unfolding.
<br>
<p>Our evolution has been a cumulative process. Footprints across time have
<br>
left traces of our reach beyond ourselves for something better. Today we
<br>
are on the threshold of the present evolution - the
<br>
transhuman.
