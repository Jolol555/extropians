<em>&gt; &quot;I' ve been pondering some questions about the concept of singularity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its meaning in transhumanist philosophy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly the term is a bit difficult to trace sometimes, since it comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from Teilhard de Chardins thoughts of the Omega- point (now that is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shaaaky fellow, but more on TDC some other time) and also from the tiplerite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tradition, but I have seen also less &quot;mystical&quot; definitions of the term.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, not all of us think that a singularity is possible- but is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desireable as a philosophical concept to be present in the discourse?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I ask my self: isn't the concept of a singularity the last grasp of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christian escathologism?
</em><br>
<p>No.  And this question is really tired in many respects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That the concept of an unlimited development became a far too great leap,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you had to invent an end time?
</em><br>
<p>Leading question with nothing in evidence to suggest any such
<br>
thing.  The Singularity is not an End.  Perhaps the end of the
<br>
beginning. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A time after which progress would be so immense that discussion of it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be pointless, often with the discussion falling down into an abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradise.
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't fall into paradise.  It falls beyond a technological
<br>
event horizon.  It could go in directions that are paradisical
<br>
compared to now (but probably don't feel that way from inside
<br>
them at all).  But it well may not.  It is impossible to say but
<br>
some of us believe, that it may be somewhat possible to
<br>
influence which general way it turns out or at least increase
<br>
the odds of happier outcomes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But hasn't the introduction of escathology also introduced the concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immanentism in transhumanism, with all its perils?
</em><br>
<p>There was no escathology as such.  There is a danger of thinking
<br>
the Singularity is simply inevitable from here and thus that
<br>
there isn't a great deal of work to be done.  But getting there
<br>
and doing so without killing off humanity or large segments
<br>
thereof, much less having there be somewhat happy to the extent
<br>
we can make it so, certainly requires work.  If we all sit on
<br>
our laurels it is much more likely that pre-Singularity we will
<br>
invent just enough with poor enough ability to wisely order our
<br>
affairs that we will destroy ourselves.  
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Virtue is achieved through action, actions that may be very, very, very much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more complex than ours- but there is still action required to achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtue.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Omega- point seen as inert, thus it is not virtuous.
</em><br>
<p>It is not inert at all.  It is vibrant possibility that we can
<br>
reach if we are wise and industrious enough. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus the Omega point is not a state of Eudaimonia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could there also be a danger that the discourse about the concept of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Omega point damages transhumanist philosophy today? Sometimes when I listen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to discussions about a possible Omega point I get very afraid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It takes us out in very deep waters indeed, speaking about things we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very little knowledge of.
</em><br>
<p>There is reason to be afraid.  So what do you do out of your
<br>
fear?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; An indeed unknown future, that is very far ahead, while neglecting the path
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to it?
</em><br>
<p>Who is neglecting the path to it? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The truth is out there, but it is damned hard to reach.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with Anders that you seem to run together the concepts of Omega
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point and singularity--and the concept of singularity is often used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ambigously. But nevertheless, perhaps you might say something about how you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceive of 'eudaimonia'.
</em><br>
<p>The Singularity doesn't require saying a lot about the
<br>
perfectability of individual humans (or posthumans).  However, I
<br>
agree that the abilities we will possess and many of the
<br>
decisions along the road to Singularity require a great deal of
<br>
serious ethical thought and development.  
<br>
<p>As far as producing happiness, happiness is a somewhat slippery
<br>
concept.  At the really &quot;happy&quot; end of what is possible I
<br>
picture all human beings being able to live long enough (with
<br>
backups, longevity treatments, uploads, whatever) and with such
<br>
an outstanding degree of freedom to get to choose how far they
<br>
will develop and in what directions and to decide what they wish
<br>
to do, learn and be.  I cannot think of anything offhand that
<br>
would produce more potential for happiness than creating and
<br>
living such a possibility for oneself and all humans and other
<br>
sentients.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical life is attainable only be a few humans and indeed is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unintelligible to the mass of humanity, &quot;the many&quot;. That the philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life will remain unknowable to the many certainly seems to have the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; epistemological slant as some understandings of the singularity. 
</em><br>
<p>Given time and technology enough it is understandable by all who
<br>
wish or will wish eventually to understand what of it can be
<br>
understood.  Aristotle is limited by the perspective of inborn
<br>
capabilities and a fixed short lifespan.  There is no need for
<br>
these to be permanent limits even well before Singularity.  Thus
<br>
there is no need to divide humans into those who get it and
<br>
those who never will.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The unmoved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mover is not Christian, so so much for your &quot;companions in guilt&quot; argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed, one might think of the unmoved mover as the country cousin of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Omega point. Perhaps you could help by saying what you think the content of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;human flourishing&quot; is. As Aristotle points out, there are many theories on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this, when people are poor they say it consists in having wealth, when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are sick it consists in health, and so on. How do you concieve of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relation between virtues and human flourishing? How should we invoke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aristotle name if we give up what many commentators call his metaphysical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biology?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Why invoke anyone's name in particular?
