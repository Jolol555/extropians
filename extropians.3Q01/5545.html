<em>&gt; U.S. workers have increased their substantial lead over Japan and

<em>&gt;all other industrial nations in the number of hours worked each year,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;according to a report issued yesterday by the International Labor

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's 137 more hours or 3 1/2 weeks more per year than Japanese

<p>Deeply questionable figures. Let's take 50 working weeks in the year,
<br>
and 5 days per week; we get 250 working days. 1979 hours a year then
<br>
gives us an average 7.9 hours per working day.
<br>
<p>Now let's look at the UK figures. 1979 - 260 = 1719. 1719/250 = 6.87
<br>
working hours per day, or (6.87 x 5) an average 34.4 hour working 
<br>
week.
<br>
<p>Huh?
<br>
<p>Official figures in the UK suggest the average working week has been
<br>
creeping up, to more like 45 hours. (We keep getting bombarded with
<br>
earnest op-ed news features about it, along with hand-wringing about
<br>
workplace stress and the way people make more errors when they work more
<br>
than 44 hours a week.)
<br>
<p>So either the British are deeply, pathologically, ill -- taking 25% of
<br>
their worktime off sick -- or these figures are Just Plain Wrong.
<br>
<p>Given that the whole spin of the article eerily mirrors the aren't-we-
<br>
working-hard articles published in the UK, I suspect we're being 
<br>
subjected to dubious figures on all fronts.

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it all depends on whether you count posting on the
