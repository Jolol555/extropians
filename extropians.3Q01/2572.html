<br>
<p>No, he meant back.  Slavery was outlawed in 1865, but the rising costs
<br>
of just about everything, especially in Taxifornia, has transformed us into
<br>
virtual wage slaves.  So the slaves were gone for some time, and are
<br>
now back.

<p><em>&gt;   Having finally made a mistake, I demand you surrender control of the Singularity list to Spike Jones! ;)
</em><br>
<p>No, please!  Anything but that!
<br>
<p>The more I learn about the singularity, the more puzzling the entire
<br>
concept becomes to me.  I realized I had misunderstood the term
<br>
singularity when I saw Eli's definition as the point when machine
<br>
intelligence exceeds human intelligence.  It is not clear to me that
<br>
the accelerating bootstrapping process would automatically occur,
<br>
even if we get a super-capable machine.  I suppose it is because
<br>
I am failing to understand machine *motivation*.  I understand what
<br>
motivates humans, but I am at a loss to explain what would motivate
<br>
a machine.  spike
