<p>&lt;&lt; Allow me to substitute the word &quot;Communist&quot; for &quot;racist&quot; in Mitch's
<br>
&nbsp;statements.  It should be interesting to see the effect! &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Lee, I have no problem with using Communists as the target bad-guys. Both 
<br>
nazis and commies are utterly vile. I am paranoid about the Communist 
<br>
Chinese, I have seen the pile of skulls from the Khmer Rouge, I understand 
<br>
the 25 million died during Mao's Great Leap Backward, and I detest the 
<br>
shit-encrusted rogue, who called himself Stalin. All these baddies had their 
<br>
millions of willing supporters.  
<br>
<p>Sauce for the Soviet Goose is sauce for the Nazi gander. We can argue about 
<br>
context, and we should at some point, but we need to be secure from both 
<br>
White Racists, Black Racists, and or Commies. Propinquity!!
<br>
<p>Communist thinking, from an economic point of view is hideous. From a 
<br>
political point of view its horrid repression at best, and collective mass 
<br>
murder typically.
<br>
<p>I think now that we have drawn this line in the sad, and know what our 
<br>
personal true-north is.  I would prefer to get more people focused on the 
<br>
esoteric subjects as covered by Hans Moravec, but everyone seems bored.
