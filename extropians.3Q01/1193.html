</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd be impressed too, it would be a wonderful show. What would it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to do with defending your land against an enemy army? Zilch.
</em><br>
<p>Why the focus on a land invasion here?  The possibility of one for either
<br>
the US or Europe right now seems quite low.  (For the US, it's very low.
<br>
Canada and Mexico hardly seem capable of such an invasion and have no reason
<br>
to.  Nations that might want to [threaten to] mount -- China? -- an
<br>
amphibious invasion don't have the capability and are a long way from
<br>
developing it.  In fact, very few nations have this capability.)
<br>
<p>The stated purpose of the current ABM program is to stop either rogue state
<br>
missle attacks or accidental missle launches (from former Soviet nations and
<br>
China).  I'm not saying I think this is the best way to go about this, but
<br>
this is a lot different than &quot;defending your land against an enemy army.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;defensive technology has lagged behind offensive tech since crossbows went
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;through medieval armor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree,
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  Defensive technology was doing fine until about 1918 with
<br>
invention of the tank.:)  (Some might argue that early German successes in
<br>
WW2 actually set them up to believe the tank and offensive warfare could
<br>
solve all problems.)  Even now, it's debatable.  We haven't seen nations
<br>
that are roughly militarily, technologically, and economically equal go up
<br>
against each other.  If, e.g., Iraq or Serbia had the US level of
<br>
technological and military development would the recent wars with them have
<br>
turned out the same?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wish it were different but that's the way it is and I see no signs of
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; changing for the better. H bombs are just too big, too numerous, and too
</em><br>
cheap,
<br>
<em>&gt; there is no defense against them.
</em><br>
<p>This last point might true, but the current ABM program is not billed as
<br>
being able to stop a massive attack.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;blowing one up is a big reduction in enemy asset
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not so, most H bombs would just shake the charred bones and rubble around
</em><br>
anyway.
<br>
<em>&gt; If 99.9% fail to reach their target it doesn't matter, .1% is more than
</em><br>
enough to kill a nation,
<br>
<em>&gt; any nation. The defense must be virtually 100% perfect or it's not worth
</em><br>
building.
<br>
<em>&gt; Conclusion: it's not worth building.
</em><br>
<p>Let's talk about a more realistic example.  Suppose Norh Korea were to
<br>
launch three or four nuclear armed missles at the US's West Coast, say,
<br>
targetting Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle.  Stopping one
<br>
of those missles would save one city from any immediate damage.  Ditto for
<br>
an accidental launch from Russia or China.  That's the kind of scenario it
<br>
appears the new ABM program is built around.  Whether it's possible or worth
<br>
the effort is another matter.
<br>
<p>This is not to say I'm completely behind the program.  I just see a few of
<br>
John Clarks' criticisms of it, for the most part, as non sequitirs.  I do
<br>
see some relevance for his point about antagonizing current nuclear powers.
<br>
Even so, IIRC, the Soviets continued to build and upgrade nuclear weapons
<br>
after the signing of the ABM treaty.  The Chinese, IIRC, build their entire
<br>
arsenal afterward.  It's not so clear that the current state of affairs is
<br>
optimal or that achieves what its current supporters claim it achieves.
<br>
<p>What I think would work better against rogue states or in general for peace
<br>
would be for the US to disengage from regional conflicts -- e.g., from the
<br>
Middle East, the Balkans, Africa, and  East Asia -- as well as to actually
<br>
embrace laissez faire capitalism.  The former would make it less likely for
<br>
regional conflicts to turn global or to involve the US, making terrorism,
<br>
nuclear or not, less likely against the US.  Also, not pouring money, for
<br>
arms or to prop up unpopular regimes, into the regions would make them more
<br>
stable.
<br>
<p>The latter would make it more likely that goods and armies would cross
<br>
borders.  If the US stopped backing bad bank loans to the Third World and
<br>
funding some of the international institutions that promote economic and
<br>
political instability -- the UN, the IMF, the World Bank -- a lot of these
<br>
problems would be mininized and might disappear.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
