<em>&gt; &gt; That &quot;someone&quot; will be you. And you can, if you want, climb a simulated

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if I can do all of that, what would be the point of it?  If and when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the attractions of life within are too great, I'll give up my old ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I like the reality of life as it is.  I won't be going in because I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can climb different mountains, or because I can choose to climb any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mountain at any point in its history.  I surely won't go in and select
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;potentially fatal consequences&quot; version.  I'll go in because that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the people are, or that's where the interesting challenges are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I predict that when I do, I'll stop climbing.  I accept the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;potentially fatal consequences&quot; because it's inseparably part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience.  It's a reinforcement to keep a certain kind of honesty as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you climb.  When I climb indoors, that rule is suspended, and that makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it a very different sport.
</em><br>
<p>I am trying to understand what you mean, but it's difficult to see any
<br>
kind of rationality here. Do you consider climbing to be some kind of
<br>
spiritual experience, or is the thrill physically addicting or what? I
<br>
don't see a good reason to put yourself into that kind of lethal situation
<br>
when we are this close to the Singularity. If I had no hope for the future,
<br>
and was convinced I was eventually going to be worm food no matter what
<br>
then yeah I could see doing stuff like this. But anyway...
<br>
<p>When you're uploaded you can do interesting stuff like: back yourself
<br>
up, then shut yourself down and leave instructions for the OS to wake
<br>
you back up with no memory of being uploaded, and place you into a
<br>
Real-Earth (tm) sim. Then when you finally kill yourself you wake up
<br>
with your upload-experience memories back intact. In other words it
<br>
should theoretically be possible for you to both be safe, AND get the
<br>
kind of honest experience you claim to enjoy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For those of you have are familiar with Marc Stiegler's &quot;The Gentle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seduction&quot;, I've read the story and I believe that it's a reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model of how the world will change.  (Remember that the central
</em><br>
<em>&gt; character is also a lover of mountains.)  If you haven't read it yet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hold tight.  I've been working on Marc to post it on FictionWise or some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other such place where you can buy it in soft copy, since it's out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; print on paper.  This is a short story that is on most lists of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropian classics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer, do you have that?
