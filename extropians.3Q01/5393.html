<em>&gt; On the subject of time series for literacy rates:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry Mike.  You objected to Pat's sources of data and pointed to other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sources.  You then compared the recent statistics in your preferred sources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the earlier statistics in Pat's, and claimed that that showed the trend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you believed.  If his oranges aren't any good, you can't prove anything by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparing your apples to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't look for very long, but I didn't find time series at the URLs you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posted.  Can you say where the time series are buried, so we can tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to this (you claim) more objective standard what has happened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over time?  The interesting question is what has happened to levels of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literacy according to any unchanging standard of what it means to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literate.  If some unvarying standards show improvement and others show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degradation, we can argue about the merits of the different standards, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until we see a series that shows the same standard being applied at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different times, we haven't learned much about changes in literacy.
</em><br>
<p>www.nifl.org has their data all tied up in their Literacy Survey, which
<br>
is not very well presented on the site.  The problem with the standards
<br>
used in Pat's data is that they changed over time, so different years
<br>
data represents different standards. Today, 'illiteracy' is used only to
<br>
describe someone who cannot read, write, or calculate anything at all,
<br>
which rather obviously only applies to severely retarded individuals.
<br>
The NIFL more properly grades its subjects into 5 levels of relative
<br>
literacy, with level 1 being, as was defined, being able to read a
<br>
little but not enough for any really functional capabilities in society.
<br>
In prior decades, 'level 1' was what was considered 'illiterate'. I
<br>
think that their 21-23% numbers for level 1 people is rather damning,
<br>
and that there is little chance that Pat could fudge similarly high
<br>
numbers for any time in the 60's or 70's.
<br>
<p>My final point is that Pat cannot disprove my point by using such old
<br>
data. Until and unless he provides data from the late 80's or early
<br>
90's, he is making no valid argument against my points.
