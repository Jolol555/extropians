Surveillance software can detect abnormal behaviour

<p>New Singapore Software Can Beef Up Surveillance
<br>
<p><a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010727/tc/tech_singapore_software_dc_1.html">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010727/tc/tech_singapore_software_dc_1.html</a>
<br>
<p>SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore scientists have created new software which
<br>
may beef up surveillance efforts in the future by distinguishing between a
<br>
person's normal activities and suspicious behavior.
<br>
<p>The software created by researchers at the Nanyang Technological University
<br>
can tell the difference between people walking, talking and acting normally,
<br>
and abnormal behavior such as a fight or someone collapsing.
<br>
<p>The Singapore team recorded and classified 73 features of human movement,
<br>
such as speed, direction, shape and pattern.
<br>
<p>The features were then used with existing ``neural network'' software, which
<br>
can learn and remember patterns, to create a new program.
<br>
<p>``Each of the features is actually generated from a formula ...then the
<br>
learning software will be able to classify certain motion as normal or
<br>
abnormal,'' associate professor Maylor Leung told Reuters on Friday.
<br>
<p>``It's something new. No one has tried (developing it) and so far we are
<br>
successful,'' he said.
<br>
<p>Images fed to the software, such as from a surveillance camera, are analyzed
<br>
almost instantly and with 96 percent accuracy, Leung said.
<br>
<p>The software can trigger an alarm when unusual movements are detected,
<br>
making it well suited for surveillance.
<br>
<p>Creating the artificial intelligence needed to recognize complex human
<br>
motion has been a challenge, Leung said.
<br>
<p>It is difficult for the human eye to accurately judge motion, such as speed,
<br>
and even harder for a software program to do so, he said.
<br>
<p>Leung is looking for partners to commercialize the software. The research,
<br>
which took two and a half years, is pending publication in several technical
<br>
journals.
