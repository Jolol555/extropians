<p>
Here I've been so busy playing the free AI game that Sean Stewart has
<br>
written for this movie that I've forgotten to drop by.  I'd forgotten
<br>
how nice it is to be surrounded by intelligent extropians.  :)
<br>
<p>BTW, if you HAVEN'T played the game, or at least taken a look... well,
<br>
you're missing out, that's for sure.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cloudmakers.org">http://www.cloudmakers.org</a>
<br>
<p>Anyway, I'm now going to put in some spoiler space, since it's the
<br>
ending that deserves the most discussion.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>So, it was not Kubrick's original intention to resurrect David's mom
<br>
by use of a bit of her hair, only to have her die a day later.
<br>
<p>No, he'd intended a full-on Tiplerian simulated resurrection.  No hair
<br>
needed, thank you!  We'll just base her on your recollections of her,
<br>
David!  Now, isn't this wonderful?  You get to live in this simulated
<br>
house with your simulated mother in a simulated real boy body FOREVER!
<br>
<p>It's the ultimate perversion of what David has always wanted: he
<br>
wanted to become part of the Real, but instead, he ends his days
<br>
enjoying the Artificial.  That's Kubrick's sense of irony for you.
<br>
It's also rather hard science fiction.  (Hell, Tipler has predicted
<br>
that this will actually happen!)
<br>
<p>It is my belief that Spielberg was unhappy with irony of this kind,
<br>
and that this is why he'll always be a rather juvenile director.  I
<br>
think it was NOT his intention that David was living in a simulation
<br>
at the end of the movie.  I think it was his intention that David's
<br>
fortuitous hair-snatching managed to resurrect his mother, for Real,
<br>
if only for a little while.
<br>
<p>With that said, I don't think Spielberg's intentions have to dominate
<br>
our interpretation of the film.  The BEST interpretation of the film
<br>
is one in which Kingsley's character, the narrator/robot, is
<br>
unreliable, or at least deceptive.  He doesn't tell David that it's
<br>
all just a simulation; he fails to mention that they're only
<br>
resurrecting his mother for a day because that's all the energy
<br>
they're prepared to waste on him.  He just lets David believe that his
<br>
mother is Real.
<br>
<p>(BTW, there's no reason to think that simulation of this kind would be
<br>
cheap or easy... if Tipler's right and it turns out that we have
<br>
infinite resources available to put to the task, then more's the
<br>
merrier, but barring that, we should expect it to be quite costly, at
<br>
least at first.)
<br>
<p>One can just imagine Kingsley's character responding to my charges of
<br>
unreliability with Obiwan's old line: &quot;You're going to find that many
<br>
of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.&quot;
<br>
After all, didn't Tipler argue that simulated resurrection IS
<br>
resurrection?  Surely Kingsley's character could argue that, in a
<br>
sense, she really WAS resurrected.
<br>
<p>So, ultimately, if we simply interpret Kingsley's character as having
<br>
a Tiplerian point-of-view, according to which simulated resurrection
<br>
just IS resurrection, and in which David exists only in simulation,
<br>
the movie turns out better.  MUCH better than Spielberg ever
<br>
intended.  :)
<br>
<p>As for the rest of the movie... I think the majority of reviewers are
<br>
right about the film's being a general failure.  It failed to move me.
<br>
It failed to move anyone I know, actually, and since I've spent so
<br>
much of my time over the last few months playing the game, I've
<br>
unwittingly recommended it to quite a few people.
<br>
<p>The Flesh Fair was just muddled.  I had no feeling for the melting
<br>
robots... no time to develop an emotional bond to them.  That should
<br>
have been the easy part... but it didn't work.
<br>
<p>As Salon's reviewer pointed out, Spielberg bent so far over backwards
<br>
to get over his past that he undermined his foundations.  Take the
<br>
moon, for example.  The moon in E.T. (Spielberg's other, far better,
<br>
movie with initials in it!) was the symbol of ultimate freedom: with
<br>
alien powers on your side, you can fly to the MOON!
<br>
<p>But in this story, the &quot;moon&quot; is nothing more than a giant blimp used
<br>
by robophobic carnies... all the better with which to see the mechas
<br>
below and capture them for the Fair.
<br>
<p>Yet who felt terrified that David would be caught?
<br>
<p>I for one had no sympathy whatsoever for him when he decided to bash
<br>
David 2's brains out.
<br>
<p>In fact, throughout, I felt ambivalent towards David.  Liking him one
<br>
minute, disliking him the next, never really getting the chance to
<br>
make a connection with him.
<br>
<p>FWIW, I feel Monica's confusion.
<br>
<p>Anyway, despite all this, the game is... well, it's unimaginably
<br>
better than the movie.  I mean it.  There's just no comparison AT
<br>
ALL.  Go!  Go now!
