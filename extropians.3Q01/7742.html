</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; policy is the industrialized world's dependence on Middle Eastern oil.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recent briefings you have become despondent over the intractable nature of

<em>&gt; &gt; the conflict between the Enlightenment cultural values you hold as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientist and the Islamic revivalist movement that is the most dynamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; political and social force throughout that region.  You want to propose some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; means of decreasing the West's dependence on fossil fuels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Question: What would you propose?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oil will continue to be favored as long as it's far cheaper to use.  Given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; staggering investments already into finding alternative energy sources, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance of any pet project replacing oil is next to nil.  So the only solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to tax oil and natural gas heavily, to the point where imports aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary.  I don't know the numbers, but I'd guesstimate 3-4 dollars
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per gallon of gas equivalent would do the trick.  Most adjustments to reduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oil consumption, such as car gas mileage, transportation arrangements, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; siting decisions, have long lead times, so the taxes should be imposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gradually.
</em><br>
<p><p>I hope you are joking.  Nuclear is cost-effective now compared
<br>
to oil
<br>
without seriously killing an already ailing economy with an
<br>
arbitrary
<br>
and utterly unnecessary 100-200% tax on gas.  I can see why
<br>
anyone 
<br>
would propose something of this kind.  Especially since most of
<br>
our
<br>
energy needs are not for cars.
