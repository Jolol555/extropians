</em><br>
<p>Which re-introduces a query I posted yesterday: What meaning do people on
<br>
this list give to the term &quot;capitalism.&quot; My dictionary defines it as &quot;an
<br>
economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital
<br>
goods, by investments that are determined by private decision rather than by
<br>
state control, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that
<br>
are determined mainly by competition in a free market.&quot;
<br>
<p>This definition is not very useful without definitions for &quot;private
<br>
decision&quot; and &quot;state control.&quot;  Clearly, this definition assumes that the
<br>
practice of capitalism is consistent within the jurisdiction of a political
<br>
state, since the definition includes ownership of capital goods by
<br>
corporations, which are creations of the state. (in this context, it's
<br>
interesting to note that the U.S. Tax Code doesn't require that a Form 1099
<br>
be filed for corporate payees)
<br>
<p>Although the distinction between state and corporation is clear where the
<br>
corporation is very small (in terms of resources controlled) relative to the
<br>
state, the distinction becomes much less clear when corporations are as
<br>
large or larger than the state under whose laws they're registered.
<br>
<p>&quot;Minarchism&quot; might be a more useful term than &quot;capitalism,&quot; but I believe
<br>
that even minarchists would allow the existence of corporations.
<br>
<p>It would probably be useful to examine the various characteristics of
<br>
corporations (perpetual existence, limited liability, management separate
<br>
from ownership, etc.) to see which of these tend to undermine truly free
<br>
markets.
