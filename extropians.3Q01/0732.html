<em>&gt;From: &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20Life%20extension%20advocasy%20plans&In-Reply-To=&lt;200107101810.LAA15230@well.com&gt;">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;This prompts me to ask the question:  Is exercise an equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alternative to CR?  Or is it better to avoid excess calories in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the first place rather than burn them off later?
</em><br>
<p>To your first question the answer is clearly no. I was reading a
<br>
study awhile back where the researchers claimed that people who are
<br>
thin have the mistaken notion that they are in excellent physical
<br>
shape and don't need to exercise. If I remember correctly they were
<br>
suffering early fatalities at a greater rate than those who are
<br>
overweight.
<br>
<p>To the second, I say yes, avoiding is easier than getting rid of
<br>
excess calories. I speak from experience on treadmill day.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I use minimal exercise to keep my stomach flat and to keep my body
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lean.  I avoid trying to develop arm and leg muscles because I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt;afraid that increasing my metabolism, burning extra calories,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;producing extra mass and oxidizing more food to produce more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;energy might speed up the aging process.
</em><br>
<p>A little extra muscle is good, you don't have to go &quot;Arnold&quot; to be
<br>
healthy. I don't have the required proof handy though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I have researched nutrition, but do not know enough about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exercising metabolism to make an informed decision.  I know that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being overweight or out of shape is bad.  But after one is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shape, is it lifespan increasing or decreasing to try to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;muscular?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know if there is a definitive study on this, since Max is
<br>
probably the list expert on fitness perhaps he can comment. Some
<br>
exercise is essential, and I would argue that if you're not
<br>
building muscle you're losing it, there is substantial evidence for
<br>
that.
<br>
<p>I vote with Leonardo Da Vinci (who could bend horseshoes with his
<br>
bare hands) and say moderation in all things.
