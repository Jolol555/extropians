&quot;Jimmy the Greek&quot; Snyder probably thought his opinion on physical differences in athletes was scientifically based (he even gave his reason - forced plantation eugenics), and the baseball guy who said black &quot;didn't have the prerequisites&quot; (intelligence) to manage sports teams - a claim also made by bigoted football coaches as to why they didn't permit blacks to try out for quarterback - most likely thought that there was a test for that sort of thing.  Of course, blacks have now successfully managed many teams, now that they've been given the chance, just as black quarterbacks have played well now that they're allowed to try (Doug Williams won a Super Bowl), which proves that anecdotes and preconceptions are a poor substitute for genuine science.  It is not racist to observe that a greater percentage of blacks have the genes for sickle cell anemia, or that a greater percentage of Semites (both Jews and Palestinians) have the genes for Tay-Sachs syndrome, or that a greater perc!
