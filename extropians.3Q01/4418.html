Subject: Burnout
<br>
<p>Fred Chamberlain's very disturbing post, alleging that the stress of
<br>
Alcor administrative problems was a major factor causing Linda's
<br>
illness, suggests a particularly grim instance of a general tendency
<br>
toward burnout that has recurred throughout the history of cryonics.
<br>
<p>Curtis Henderson, cofounder of the Cryonics Society of New York, enjoyed a
<br>
comfortable life before he discovered cryonics in the late 1960s. As
<br>
Curtis has described many times, he was supported by a trust fund, had an
<br>
easy part-time job as an insurance adjuster, was married to a lovely wife,
<br>
had a pleasant home in Long Island, and even owned a private airplane. All
<br>
these attributes of his life were destroyed or damaged after he started
<br>
running a cryonics organization.
<br>
<p>Casualties have been piling up ever since, partly because cryonics rouses
<br>
intense passions by offering the tantalizing possibility of unlimited
<br>
future life. When the stakes are so high, any small dispute can turn into
<br>
a major confrontation. Moreover, resolving these differences is difficult
<br>
because cryonics attracts people who are not team players and find
<br>
compromise unsatisfactory.
<br>
<p>In my own limited experience, I have seen many people afflicted by stress,
<br>
unhappiness, and depression in cryonics, to the point where they give up,
<br>
burn out, drop out, or feel sufficiently rejected that they retreat,
<br>
temporarily or permanently. Examples include noted activists such as Mike
<br>
Darwin, Brenda Peters, Carlos Mondragon, Paul Wakfer, Steve Harris, Brian
<br>
Shock, Ralph Whelan, Tanya Jones, Steve Bridge, and others.
<br>
<p>I have escaped relatively unscathed myself, but possibly Fred regards me
<br>
as a contributory factor to Linda's stress, because I aired some
<br>
discontent about her policies publicly. If I exacerbated a difficult
<br>
situation, I do apologize. I hope it is obvious that my primary concern
<br>
was the welfare of the organization.
<br>
<p>However, I suspect that much or most of the unhappiness that people in
<br>
cryonics have inflicted on each other during the past 10 years was
<br>
perpetrated in the seemingly worthy desire to enhance or protect the
<br>
welfare of organizations.
<br>
<p>In the near future, I am told that Alcor seems likely to acquire Jerry
<br>
Lemler as its new President. I've met Dr. Lemler and like him a lot. In
<br>
fact, I think he's very good at being a likable guy. But I hope he
<br>
realizes that being likable won't necessarily provide any protection.
<br>
Former Alcor president Steve Bridge was just as likable, and Steve
<br>
certainly endured his share of stress.
<br>
<p>When Rodney King went on TV during the LA riots and complained, &quot;Why can't
<br>
we all just get along?&quot; his statement was seemingly heartfelt, but
<br>
meaningless. If people care strongly enough about an issue, and they feel
<br>
sufficiently angry or frustrated, they _can't_ all get along.
<br>
<p>I like to think that cryonics will be run more like a business,
<br>
eventually. Until then, I can only say how glad I am that Dr. Lemler has a
<br>
background in psychiatry. This will be a valuable attribute in managing
<br>
the factionism of socially dysfunctional people (a category in which I
<br>
include myself); but more to the point, it may enable Dr. Lemler to
<br>
protect himself more effectively than some of his predecessors.
<br>
