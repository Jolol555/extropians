<p>
In this time of troubles it's reassuring to know that one can turn off
<br>
the disturbing network news and catch lighthearted shows like Lexx on
<br>
the scifi channel. Lexx might be classified as a sci-fi comedy-drama,
<br>
though it is such a strange show that it defies conventional
<br>
categorizing. Lexx is a giant spaceship made from a mutated insect and
<br>
crewed by some plucky stowaways. Let's tune into the psyche of this
<br>
Canadian-German production via this quick synopsis:
<br>
<p>Just in this season (we're in season 4, about halfway thru 'Lexx comes
<br>
to Earth') we've seen a) the destruction of Pluto (target practice), b)
<br>
the obliteration of Orlando (a mistaken shot from the Lexx, despite the
<br>
target practice), c) the nuclear obliteration of Cuba (blamed for
<br>
Orlando for political reasons), d) possibly the most utterly tasteless
<br>
re-creation of the JFK assassination ever -- by the ATF, the instrument
<br>
of evil in this show -- (this time, the president's obese wife was
<br>
killed, flailing around in the back seat screaming for her life as
<br>
bullet after bullet slammed into her), e) the nuclear obliteration of
<br>
Newfoundland (the U.S. president's girlfriend fellated someone there,
<br>
and he got pissed), and f) the destruction of several other nearby
<br>
planets just for fun. I suppose I could add g) there's a minor
<br>
background plot with
<br>
the Earth under invasion by some sort of small life-form that seems to
<br>
prefer attacking by ramming itself into a victim's anus, in this way
<br>
giving freedom to a teenage girl who drove away laughing in glee after
<br>
both her parents were killed. (The first thing the aliens killed was an
<br>
old lady's cat).
<br>
<p>At this rate I wouldn't be surprised if they nova'd the sun by the end
<br>
of the season. BTW it's just a coincidence that the Lexx crew is on
<br>
Earth, the show is not about Earth; usually everyone is an alien.
<br>
<p>Many, many of the guest stars on this show are killed, often quickly and
<br>
all at once (or in a fast sequence), frequently in the final few minutes
<br>
of an episode. Sometimes with blade weapons that pass at high speed thru
<br>
multiple bodies. Even sympathetic characters are often killed, singly
<br>
and in large groups. Often casually, for no real purpose. In the 3rd
<br>
season, one of the most beautiful female characters was strapped to an
<br>
iron chair, covered head to toe with thick oil, and set afire. Her
<br>
character was quite reserved and fatalistic, but she died screaming
<br>
anyway.
<br>
<p>Of course even these scenes of horror pale before the 1st season's
<br>
killing of all humanity among a league of 20,000 planets to feed a giant
<br>
insect called the Gigashadow, or the 2nd season's destruction of an
<br>
entire universe. Fortunately no one had to experience that as all matter
<br>
in that universe had already been converted to replicating
<br>
death-machines under the command of an evil uploaded intelligence. The
<br>
3rd season was comparatively mild as only two populated planets were
<br>
obliterated. Of course, these were the only planets seen during this
<br>
season. (The people's souls though were reborn on Earth, and several
<br>
have already met bloody deaths).
<br>
<p>The characters are Xev, the love slave, who's frequent attempts to have
<br>
sex with anybody typically end in disaster (she ate her last potential
<br>
lover, leaving a bloody pile of grease and hair), Stan, the cowardly
<br>
security guard who's traitorous actions had already resulted in the
<br>
deaths of millions as 92 planets were obliterated based on data he
<br>
leaked, and Kai, the dead guy, who frequently kills people to protect
<br>
Xev and Stan
<br>
(and as a former assassin, has killed thousands). And a robot head
<br>
fixated on the dead guy. It's killed people too. Sometimes they cut away
<br>
from the main action to let the robot head say a love poem.
<br>
<p>Lexx (the ship) is a character too, and far from innocent, as in the
<br>
very first show where a prisoner is shown executed via
<br>
robotically-controlled bone saws, his guts and body parts plopping into
<br>
a clear plastic bag, which is then released to merge with hundreds of
<br>
others of similar fate on a conveyor belt, the camera then pulling back
<br>
to reveal a huge array of parallel conveyor belts, feeding thousands of
<br>
bodies a minute into this voracious meat-eating spaceship. Bon appetit!
<br>
And of course Lexx has a planet-destroying ray weapon which has seen
<br>
frequent use.
<br>
<p>Unlike most shows, Lexx frequently shows people falling from great
<br>
heights all the way till the splat at the end. Sometimes they bounce off
<br>
obstructions on the way down, with a wet sound and splotch of blood.
<br>
Early on this season, a bright young kid was more or less crucified on a
<br>
wall at a great height, till he escaped, machine-gunned several guards
<br>
(including some who helped him, at gunpoint, then killed just for
<br>
convenience), eventually carrying a sack of machine guns with him till
<br>
he tried to escape in a moth (Lexx auxillary craft) and fell out,
<br>
falling a couple hundred feet till the inevitable splat, while we
<br>
watched.
<br>
<p>Note that the Canadian and/or German sensibilities appear to allow
<br>
exposed female breasts on television, which appear on occassion in Lexx
<br>
and are of course fuzzed out for the american audience. Can't expose
<br>
people to that, no sir.
<br>
<p>The thing is, it's actually a pretty good show, often hilarious. And the
<br>
characters have kind hearts. Or at least Xev does. It's not their fault
<br>
death and destruction seem to follow them around wherever they go.
