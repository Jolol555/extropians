<p><em>&gt;You have to draw your lines very carefully in order to define such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a market.  Please give an example in which the customers don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have alternatives.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;disclaimer: I do not speak for SBC/Ameritech, my opinions are my
<br>
own &gt;
<br>
<p>I was thinking of telecom, especially since I sit in the middle of
<br>
one of the biggest data centers in the U.S. ;)
<br>
<p>The PLEC's (parasitic local exchange carriers) who deceptively
<br>
refer to themselves as &quot;competitors&quot; (the only thing they're
<br>
competing for is a share of RBOC generated profit) consistantly try
<br>
to argue that it would be prohibitively expensive to &quot;duplicate&quot;
<br>
existing infrastructure.
<br>
<p>We've got 80+ of them feeding on us at the moment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is similar to the case several years ago when the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was trying to decide whether to prosecute the three biggest makers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of breakfast cereals for monopolizing their market.  In order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consider that possibility, they had to ignore the fact that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have many other choices.  If the cereal companies raise prices too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;high, people will eat eggs or waffles, or (heavens!) make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sandwiches for breakfast.
</em><br>
<p>A good example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The only examples I know of are in telecom and other utilities in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which governments have traditionally imposed a monopoly in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to protect us from the dangers of a natural monopoly.
</em><br>
<p>Actually if you check the history (I have the archives here in my
<br>
building) the reason for granting the monopoly was if we agreed to
<br>
provide universal service.
<br>
<p>Universal service is the first thing disintegrating since the 1996
<br>
telecom act.
