<em>&gt; &gt;Well, it's good to see that people are taking these terms so lightly. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;must say I was rather stunned to see in the newspaper an article about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the first American team to play a match of cricket at Lord's in jolly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;ole' eland. They were a racially diverse team from East Los Angeles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;whose official team name is the Compton Homies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Given how much native americans hate having terms referring to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;themselves used in sports team names, I am rather surprised at this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;double standard...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd be very surprised if there aren't many Native American sports teams
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using names
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that refer to various aspects of native culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike i think what your failing to understand here is &quot;Cultural ownership of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's fine for ppl from a given community to use certain terms to describe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and others around them. Whilst for an &quot;outsider&quot; to use the same term is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insulting but more like too familiar. the same rule applies to all races
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and creeds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If i called someone US citizens &quot;White Trash&quot;, &quot;Trailer Trash&quot;, &quot;Cracker&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or &quot;Cheese Head&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd expect to get my Brit ass shot off or at least punched. :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But we both know that these terms are commonly banded about within those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular communities.
</em><br>
<p>Then why do you limeys always use the term 'Yank'? It's bad enough to
<br>
describe a northerner that way, but to call someone from the
<br>
Southeastern US a 'Yank' is, in fact, a grave insult.
<br>
<p>The term 'Yankee' properly applies generally only to residents of the
<br>
states of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. We consider it a descriptor
<br>
of thrift, economy, productivity, ingenuity and 'down to earth' living,
<br>
self restraint and modesty. It is by no means an insult here, and we
<br>
don't mind at all if 'flatlanders', 'city slickers', 'crackers',
<br>
'limeys', or 'eurotrash' describe us as such.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My problem with this kind of thing is the persistent use of the &quot;N&quot; word in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afro-American culture particularly music. With result it's becoming a commonly used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phrase in black communities around the world, my own relatives in the West Indies use it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all too often. I do feel however the use of this word within the black community only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weakens any argument against me and my relatives having to tolerate it's unfriendly use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So as you can see no double standard, just the typical usual somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peculiar workings of  ppls irrational cultures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (JOKING)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You should talk to more black ppl Mike, oh sorry you guys have &quot;ppl of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; color&quot; don't you. :)
</em><br>
<p>Ah, no, that is a passe term. 'African American' is the polite term,
<br>
'black' is generally used in verbal shorthand.
