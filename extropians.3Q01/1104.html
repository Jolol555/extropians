Samantha quoted
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I have no idea what brought this on, Samantha. Nothing I said in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;response to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Party of Citizens was an attack on you or even referred to you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<p>and said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What do you mean &quot;brought this on&quot;?  What this?
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;this&quot; I referred to was what struck me, rightly or wrongly, as a very 
<br>
defensive response to comments that were not directed at you.
<br>
<p>&lt;big snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; However, the aggressive attack on supposed &quot;scientism&quot; by Party of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - and the hackneyed claims about a scientistic &quot;religion&quot; - demanded a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rebuttal.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I agree it requires a rebuttal.
</em><br>
<p><p>We're at one on this point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Hopefully such will say what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*scientism* is and is not.  I do think there is something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;word does apply fairly to but not of the kind or to the degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that P.O.C. alluded to.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it's certainly not the same as a commitment to rational standards of 
<br>
inquiry and criticism in our search for explanations of phenomena and 
<br>
knowledge of the world.
<br>
<p>I realise these are not the only things we want. I once wrote (in an article 
<br>
published in _Quadrant_ magazine):
<br>
<p>&quot;I should add that evolutionary psychology and cognitive neuroscience are 
<br>
not about to put the humanities, in particular, out of business. At this 
<br>
stage, there is a banality in attempts by the likes of Steven Pinker and 
<br>
Edward O. Wilson to produce illuminating comment about the arts, based on 
<br>
evolutionary considerations. There are good reasons why the natural sciences 
<br>
cannot provide a substitute for humanistic explanation, even if we obtain a 
<br>
far deeper understanding of our own genetic and neurophysiological make-up. 
<br>
This is partly because reductive science is ill-equipped to deal with the 
<br>
particularity of complex events, partly because causal explanation may not 
<br>
be all that we want, anyway, when we try to interpret and clarify human 
<br>
experience.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sorry if I seem to be blowing my own horn by quoting from my own 
<br>
publications, but I don't think I could come up with a better formulation 
<br>
from scratch. I still believe the above, though I'd now perhaps try to 
<br>
qualify or re-word the bit about &quot;causal&quot; explanation. I've come to put less 
<br>
emphasis on causality as a feature in scientific explanations.
<br>
<p>If there is a use for the word &quot;scientism&quot; it might apply to the position of 
<br>
someone who entirely rejected the domain of aesthetic/cultural value (which 
<br>
is at least part of what you seem to mean by the &quot;spiritual&quot; domain). But 
<br>
even this would not be a &quot;religion&quot; as far as I can see, more a state of 
<br>
psychological impoverishment. Nor does it strike me as a position that could 
<br>
be derived from rational analysis of any kind. In any event, I have no basis 
<br>
at this stage for believing that anyone on this list is stricken with 
<br>
scientism as I've just defined it. If you, who have been here much longer, 
<br>
have a different perception, I won't argue - I'll leave that to others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Russ who is still prepared to be conciliatory to allies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am glad to hear it but I was really not offended by you or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anything you said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- samantha
</em><br>
<p>Okay, thanks for clarifying that. And there's not much in the snipped 
<br>
portion of your latest post that I would seriously argue with.
<br>
<p>Peace
