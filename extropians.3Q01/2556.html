<p>You probably have in mind a &quot;solution&quot; in which
<br>
one day someone takes strong action and everyone
<br>
must agree to this action, or else!  Fortunately,
<br>
where there is great freedom and liberty, no one
<br>
can take such strong action. &gt;
<br>
<p>Lee, I believe you may be overlooking the fact the the US Constitution, as
<br>
originally drafted, only attempted to assure the freedom of a certain group
<br>
of people.
<br>
<p>I would think that a true libertarian would have felt it his or her duty to
<br>
do whatever was necessary to overthrow a government based on such a
<br>
constitution (or to amend the constitution). I've always admired Nat
<br>
Turner's spirit.
<br>
<p>The situation in which some members of a society have been subject to
<br>
grossly unfair, crippling laws, is not the same as the one in which everyone
<br>
starts out with equal legal status. You may not have been to the southern US
<br>
during the 1950's when a person could be arrested for drinking from the
<br>
wrong water fountain or entering a public restroom (built, incidentally,
<br>
with tax revenues to which you contributed), so perhaps you don't understand
<br>
that there were actually LAWS enforcing arrogance, nastiness, and racism.
