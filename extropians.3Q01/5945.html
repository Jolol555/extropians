<p>I just did something I never expected to have to do ...
<br>
<p>Back in my youth, I made a career error and ended up qualifying as a
<br>
pharmacist. It took me a couple of years thereafter to realise how bad a
<br>
mistake this was for me, go back into academia, get a degree in something
<br>
I was _interested_ in (computer science), and start a new career.
<br>
<p>I've just sent a preliminary enquiry to the Royal Pharmaceutical Society,
<br>
asking about regulatory and educational requirements I'd need to meet
<br>
to go back into the profession. (I've got the Pharmacy degree and the
<br>
sheepskin to prove I'm allowed to deal in heroin and cocaine in the
<br>
course of my lawful business, but I've been out of it for a decade and
<br>
times have changed.)
<br>
<p>My reason? 
<br>
<p>I detested being a pharmacist. It damn near gave me a nervous breakdown
<br>
before I realised that I had the option of jacking it in and doing
<br>
something else instead. But if this law ends up going through, it's
<br>
liable to kill my preferred profession stone dead. I need to be able
<br>
to earn a living, and counting pills is better paid than secretarial work.
<br>
<p>Lest you think I'm exaggerating, consider that the implications of the
<br>
SSSCA bill would make it an offense to use a compiler or development
<br>
tools that _could_ circumvent a protection device. Can you spell &quot;licensed
<br>
software engineer&quot;? With random spot inspections to ensure that you're
<br>
not using any uncertified, dangerous, free software tools?
<br>
<p>This bill can't be allowed to go through and spread world-wide: it would
<br>
be a catastrophe.
