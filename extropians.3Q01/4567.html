<p><em>&gt;&gt; Childcare should be provided by the parents, not the government.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;In your opinion, who should provide for schools - the parents, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well? 
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely, why should non-parents foot the bill?
<br>
<p>Before I get branded an ogre let me explain.
<br>
<p>As a fairly recent convert to the idea of a flat tax (don't know
<br>
why it took so long!) I think everyone should pay the same
<br>
percentage. Now as far as schools are concerned, we would all pay
<br>
something, but parents would pay additional for each child for
<br>
every year they're in school.
<br>
<p>Fair and reasonable, and very free market.
<br>
<p>I think the care of children is the primary responsibility of the
<br>
parents, if they choose to have someone else care for their
<br>
children, then they can foot the bill.
<br>
<p>Also fair and reasonable.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;(While we're on the subject, I would also like to see schools get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;away from the agrarian model of having summer vacations - very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;retrograde.)
</em><br>
<p>I'm still out on this one, I want what's best for kids, but as a
<br>
kid I know I lived for summer vacation. Maybe shortening it a bit?
<br>
(compromise?)
