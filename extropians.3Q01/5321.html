<em>&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Mitchell, Jerry (3337)&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:Jerry.Mitchell@esavio.com?Subject=RE:%20Paying%20for%20Schools&In-Reply-To=&lt;000801c130b2$04b383b0$10031c18@cosmicv&gt;">Jerry.Mitchell@esavio.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Every benefit modern workers enjoy was earned for them by Union
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;labor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Really? I dont remember my stock options being paid for in blood,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;or the extra vacation days above the minimum either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The operative words here are &quot;I don't remember&quot;, that's because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these rights and a whole bunch of others you probably take for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; granted were earned by the efforts of union members long before you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were born.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Maybe then you can clarify the exact point in time and space that &quot;Stock
<br>
options&quot; and the days that are above the minimum were fought for and
<br>
achieved? While you at it, find out where they were forced to pay for my
<br>
relocation to a new city for this job.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 8 hour work days, 40 hour work weeks, sick time, vacation time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overtime pay, health benefits.... The list goes on and on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What about my company bonus? When did the evil buisness owners collapse to
<br>
the demands for this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;You need to learn that supply and demand work for LABOR as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;products. If labor is short, they HAVE to up pay and benefits to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;keep workers. Yeah, it was tough at first, but I put forth that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the labor movement had just let the industries grow until there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;was a labor shortage, you would have had the same result and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;probably the workers would have had far MORE benefits then today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;By artificially extracting resources from the buisnesses, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;caused an aberation in the market that caused buisnesses to grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;more slowly, thereby preventing them from producing jobs as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;quckly. This resulted in the balance of supply and demand of labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;taking even longer to come into balance. They cut their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;throats.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually you'll find I understand supply and demand as well as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; host of macro/microeconomic theory as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tough? People were starving to death while others made millions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Businesses didn't start handing out benefits from the goodness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their hearts, these rights had to be earned by struggle, our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predecessors fought and died for each and every one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Their is no labor shortage if you are the only business in town
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (monopsony) think West Virginia mining town, think Hershey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pennsylvania, think Flint Michigan.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Labor shortages are a modern problem, although skilled labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably always has been, especially labor willing to work for what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're willing to pay.
</em><br>
<p>Like I said, this &quot;modern labor shortage&quot; could have been reached MUCH
<br>
earlier if the market for labor wasnt distorted by labor unions trying to
<br>
artificially raise their pay rates above market value.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note the surge in H-1(a) visas to allow high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tech workers from other countries to displace high tech workers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, holding down the cost.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Early unions forced business to be competitive for labor, not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other way around.
</em><br>
<p>Only by controlling the supply of labor by force. What if a factory was
<br>
forced to pay people 3 dollars and hour, and they were forced to do so by
<br>
the union. Then here I come in. I need a job so I tell the company Ill do
<br>
the work for 2.50 and hour. The supply just lowered the value of the labor,
<br>
but wait, they cant hire me at that rate, the union wont let them. Too bad
<br>
too, the company had enough money budgeted in to accept me at that rate, but
<br>
cant afford me at $3. Guess Ill just have to go tell the kids no food this
<br>
month. If you dought this happens, look at the people working in the
<br>
automotive companies making 50K a year for bolting on wheels. Now THATS
<br>
insanity. The work isnt worth whats being paid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I never said that all the old buisness owners were angels, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;dont hear you telling the story of how teamsters were gentle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;non-violent protestors either. How many people did they kill or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;maim for crossing picket lines (when those people crossing were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;just trying to make enough to feed their kids)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you think was happening to the children of those on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picket line? Steak and lobster every night? These people were and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are fighting for survival.
</em><br>
<p>So lets just get them to throw a monkey wrench into the company machinery,
<br>
that ought to help create wealth a lot. Maybe their related to those
<br>
Luddites?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Everone that wants to slam these &quot;Evil Capitalists&quot; need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;kissing their feet for providing jobs for all those people that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;would have otherwise starved. Buisnesses no more set the price of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;labor then they do for sneakers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not condemning capitalists or capitalism, I AM a capitalist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I refuse to ignore the past or current excesses of individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or corporations, or the technical shortcomings of capitalism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself, and I continue to successfully negotiate for a fair share
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the profits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Technical shortcomings of capitalism? Like what? The fact everyone wasnt
<br>
millionares overnight? I hope you didnt expect capitalism to magicially make
<br>
everyone wealthy instantly, it takes time to build trade up to the levels
<br>
they are now.
<br>
<p>Let me summerize this in 2 points.
<br>
1. Labor unions OR buisnesses dont controll the price of labor.
<br>
2. Distortions in the market create inefficiencies and ultimately slow down
<br>
wealth creation.
