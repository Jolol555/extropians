<p>Do you have doubts that a Cessna or a lorry will be unable to deliver a
<br>
200 kg object? I'm pretty certain you can ship a piece of slightly
<br>
subcritical Pu239 with UPS, and no one would give a damn. If it needs be,
<br>
I'll just use a cartwheel.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Gee, if it's so easy why hasn't it happened yet. More sarcasm by

<p>Why are there no instances of properly done WOMD terrorism, yet? Well, you
<br>
have to be evil, irrational, wealthy and reasonably competent, and
<br>
marginally lucky. Such traits are more or less independently distributed,
<br>
though some of them are correlated. There's a probability of such an event
<br>
occuring, and with every passing year it is getting easier. So, this
<br>
hasn't happened, yet. Will this happen, eventually? It sure seems so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the way, you can't defend against every possible scenario.
</em><br>
<p>But I don't have to burn gigabucks on improbable scenarios, hein?
<br>
Would seem rather wasteful, if not entirely pointless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Biological warfare is considerably more difficult than most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe.
</em><br>
<p>Well, given a choice between aerosoling VX in the subway, or dumping MDR
<br>
anthrax spores into air ducts of said subway, or doing airburst during a
<br>
large sports game, or obtaining fissibles and building a few kTon nuke I'd
<br>
probably choose anthrax. VX would come a close second, nukes I wouldn't
<br>
even consider, until someone helpful would supply me with more or less
<br>
useful Pu, and even then I would have a hard time. I would be a lot more
<br>
comfortable with vacuuming off anthrax in a suit than trying to make a few
<br>
100 kg of VX with heavy protection in the desert somewhere. Have you ever
<br>
worn heavy protection for prolonged periods of time? It's not fun.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You continue to argue this point while continuing to ignore the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Why would a terrorist want to use ICBMs? Tell me why this is likely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; possible to defend against every possibility.
</em><br>
<p>No, but if you're smart about it you apply your resources so that you get
<br>
optimal ROI. Star wars rapidly gets ridiculously expensive. You have to
<br>
add a zero to the officially published numbers, then you're roughly in the
<br>
ballpark of the real costs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your right, we've been through this before, the technology you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speak of is not in the hands of those the system is designed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defend against, your other delivery modes are unproven as well.
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me, we're not talking about a superpower. We're talking about those
<br>
rogue states which are piss poor they can only afford a few nukes, and of
<br>
course they will buy some obsolete Russian delivery vehicles, just to make
<br>
it easy for you to not make them nuke a few 100 k people. Such people
<br>
don't have a driving license, nor do they have a pilot's license to fly a
<br>
Cessna. Makes sense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For about the fourth time, the system is not designed to defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against a superpower. A large scale attack would be met with large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scale retaliation.
</em><br>
<p>You mentioned China, for some strange reason, so I felt compelled to point
<br>
out that such umbrella is useless against a superpower. You keep harping
<br>
that terrorists are nice enough to make it easy for you, which is somehow
<br>
unconvincing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I didn't grow up that way, but by the way it's going to happen
</em><br>
<p>Well, 1975-1980 was sure that way in Moscow, and it was similiar 1980-19xx
<br>
in MUC, whenever the Cold War started to peter out. I'm sure most people
<br>
don't have a gut feel for what a nuke can do to a nice Sunday afternoon,
<br>
but it sure helps watching them nuke test movies. Smoking pigs squealing,
<br>
then getting splattered as the shockwave hits. Houses smoking, then
<br>
disintegrating. Etc, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; again anyway. China is going to develop a large scale nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capability and we're right back where we were, honestly.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I feel pretty much the opposite, except I feel there are some good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments against.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, tell me a few good arguments as to why you think the umbrella will
<br>
work against a sneaky terrorist type of attack which won't use ICBMs.
<br>
Trust me, they won't. They won't advertise it on prime time TV, either. In
<br>
fact they won't even tell you afterwards who nuked you. They're crazy, but
<br>
they're not that stupid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 18 minutes or so, less from a sub, and the cost of the underground
</em><br>
<p>18 minutes is a great long time, particularly if the average distance to
<br>
the next shelter is short. Like, really short.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; defense shelters you mention dwarves the cost of a missile defense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by several orders of magnitude, not to mention being completely
</em><br>
<p>So, how many shelters can you build for 300 gigabucks, or so?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; useless.
</em><br>
<p>Useless? Them are few nukes, we agreed, since this is a limited scale
<br>
attack. You're not carpet bombing the target, and you're not laying one
<br>
after another with some few min pause in between. If you want to get
<br>
killed, you choose a clear day and stand in the open exposing maximum
<br>
amount of skin. The IR flash fries your skin, and if the shockwave doesn't
<br>
finish you off the burns will, eventually. If you stand behind something
<br>
as flimsy as a white sheet of linen, and after the flash rapidly duck
<br>
behind a sturdy wall, the kill radius suddenly shrinks, a lot. If you sit
<br>
in a simple cellar, the kill radius shrinks a lot farther. If you sit 10 m
<br>
underground, in a more or less intelligently designed bunker the typical
<br>
weak terrorist nuke (which will be typically not a ground explosion, as
<br>
you want to fry as many as possible) could explode within few 100 m
<br>
radius, and you should still survive it. With enough material between you
<br>
and the nuke, and if it doesn't couple to the ground the thing could
<br>
explode on top of you, and you would be still fine.
<br>
<p>So, unless you explain the kill mechanism which is supposed to get the
<br>
people in the bunkers I'm so far unconvinced.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; underground shelters of the type you describe are far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive and essentially useless.
</em><br>
<p>Subways are expensive, but they're there. Underground parking lots are
<br>
expensive, but they're there. Integrating bunkers into houses translates
<br>
into extra reinforced concrete and more earthworks, it's an incremental
<br>
cost on existing houses. Few hundred gigabucks can buy a lot of these.
