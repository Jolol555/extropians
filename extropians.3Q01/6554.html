<p>
This was sent to me and is the kind of thing that has to be thrown into the
<br>
mix:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;   &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;    &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I've been hearing a lot of talk about &quot;bombing Afghanistan back to the
<br>
Stone Age.&quot; Ronn Owens, on KGO Talk Radio today, allowed that this would
<br>
mean killing innocent people, people who had nothing to do with this
<br>
atrocity, but &quot;we're at war, we have to accept collateral damage. What
<br>
else can we do?&quot; Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing
<br>
whether we &quot;have the belly to do what must be done.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I am
<br>
from Afghanistan, and even though I've lived here for 35 years I've
<br>
never lost track of what's going on there. So I want to tell anyone who
<br>
will listen how it all looks from where I'm standing.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. There is no
<br>
doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity in
<br>
New York. I agree that something must be done about those monsters.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan. They're not even the
<br>
government of Afghanistan. The Taliban are a cult of ignorant
<br>
psychotics who took over Afghanistan in 1997. Bin Laden is a political
<br>
criminal with a plan. When you think Taliban, think Nazis. When you
<br>
think Bin Laden, think Hitler. And when you think &quot;the people of
<br>
Afghanistan&quot; think &quot;the Jews in the concentration camps.&quot; It's not
<br>
only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity. They
<br>
were the first victims of the perpetrators. They would exult if someone
<br>
would come in there, take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of
<br>
international thugs holed up in their country.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
Some say, why don't the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban? The
<br>
answer is, they're starved, exhausted, hurt, incapacitated, suffering.
<br>
A few years ago, the United Nations estimated that there are 500,000
<br>
disabled orphans in Afghanistan--a country with no economy, no food.
<br>
There are millions of widows. And the Taliban has been burying these
<br>
widows alive in mass graves. The soil is littered with land mines, the
<br>
farms were all destroyed by the Soviets. These are a few of the reasons
<br>
why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone
<br>
Age. Trouble is, that's been done. The Soviets took care of it already.
<br>
Make the Afghans suffer? They're already suffering. Level their houses?
<br>
Done. Turn their schools into piles of rubble? Done. Eradicate their
<br>
hospitals? Done. Destroy their infrastructure? Cut them off from
<br>
medicine and health care? Too late. Someone already did all that.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs. Would they at
<br>
least get the Taliban? Not likely. In today's Afghanistan, only the
<br>
Taliban eat, only they have the means to move around. They'd slip away
<br>
and hide. Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans, they
<br>
don't move too fast, they don't even have wheelchairs. But flying over
<br>
Kabul and dropping bombs wouldn't really be a strike against the
<br>
criminals who did this horrific thing. Actually it would only be making
<br>
common cause with the Taliban--by raping once again the people they've
<br>
been raping all this time
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
So what else is there? What can be done, then? Let me now speak with
<br>
true fear and trembling. The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there
<br>
with ground troops. When people speak of &quot;having the belly to do what
<br>
needs to be done&quot; they're thinking in terms of having the belly to kill
<br>
as many as needed. Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about
<br>
killing innocent people. Let's pull our heads out of the sand. What's
<br>
actually on the table is Americans dying. And not just because some
<br>
Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin
<br>
Laden's hideout. It's much bigger than that folks. Because to get any
<br>
troops to Afghanistan, we'd have to go through Pakistan. Would they let
<br>
us? Not likely. The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first. Will
<br>
other Muslim nations just stand by? You see where I'm going. We're
<br>
flirting with a world war between Islam and the West.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
And guess what: that's Bin Laden's program. That's exactly what he
<br>
wants. That's why he did this. Read his speeches and statements. It's
<br>
all right there. He really believes Islam would beat the west. It might
<br>
seem ridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam
<br>
and the West, he's got a billion soldiers. If the west wreaks a
<br>
holocaust in those lands, that's a billion people with nothing left to
<br>
lose, that's even better from Bin Laden's point of view. He's probably
<br>
wrong, in the end the west would win, whatever that would mean, but the
<br>
war would last for years and millions would die, not just theirs but
<br>
ours. Who has the belly for that? Bin Laden does. Anyone else?
<br>
