<em>&gt; &gt; For these reasons, public opinion turned in favor of the GOP and against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Democrats because of perceptions of ethical behavior and lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sportsmanship. By persisting in claiming they were robbed of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; election, despite extensive recounts using the same election day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; standards by independent organizations, the Democrats don't seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; realize they lose more credibility, so polarized are they by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; propaganda generated perception that the election of Bush will destroy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the country (likely even more than people like myself felt similarly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about an election of Gore).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wrong.  The Republicans only followed the law and election procedures where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they wanted to.  They rejected the law that required postmarks on all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absentee ballots because the military votes did not have postmarks.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counted these votes &quot;to be fair&quot; even though it violated the law.
</em><br>
<p>Specifically because PRIOR court precedents said that military ballots
<br>
did not have to have post marks on them. Therefore, they did NOT violate
<br>
the law.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They also allowed the Republican party to &quot;correct&quot; 20,000 absentee ballots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that did not include the required identification numbers on them.  By law,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these votes should have been excluded.  By law, these votes should not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been in possession of Republicans outside the election system.  By law,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these votes should not have been altered.  But the Republicans did it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway.
</em><br>
<p>a) the 'corrections' were not in the way the voters voted, but in that
<br>
the ballots were supposed to be printed with their voter ID numbers on
<br>
them already. Most voters voting in absentia have no means of
<br>
determining their voter ID numbers, it is the responsibility of the
<br>
state to provide them. To penalize the voters for the actions of the
<br>
state is an illegal disenfranchisement, as the courts ruled.
<br>
b) the ballots were never outside the election system. The GOP provided
<br>
staff to write in the voter ID numbers on government premises.
<br>
c) Votes were NEVER altered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Republicans also fought &quot;for&quot; recounts in some counties where they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought they would improve, like Volusia county, and &quot;against&quot; recounts in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other counties where they thought they would win.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but in no instance did they insist on ballot counting rules that
<br>
deviated from those in place on election day, as I said before and you
<br>
ignored.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Republicans were not any more sporting or ethical than Democrats.  Both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parties fought contradictory legal battles in different counties depending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on which way they wanted the vote to go.  Both parties argued for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing recount and ballot laws in some counties while simultaneously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguing against these laws in other counties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am constantly amazed by the perception on both sides that only the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side played unfairly.  I see neither side acting superior to the other in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Florida elections.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One side note:  Later studies show that many other states had worse problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with uncounted ballots.  It was only Florida's sunshine law and pivotal role
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the election that put the focus on Florida.  Most state elections are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as screwed up, but the media does not have access to the counting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process in those states, and there was not as much attention given to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, somewhere between 4-6 million ballots were thrown out, including a
<br>
couple hundred thousand alone in the Illinois County that is home to
<br>
Gore's campaign chairman, old 'Two Vote' Daley.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The spoilsport antics of the rent-a-riot left wing at the inauguration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and since have continued to help Bush by casting the left as too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immature to lead, and too shrilly extremist to represent the people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is too funny.  The Republicans did the same thing in Miami when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flew in paid participants for their riot.  Both sides do the exact same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing, and yet most people only recall the poor behavior on one side.
</em><br>
<p>Show me footage of a republican 'riot'. Only one instance did they stage
<br>
a peaceful protest, outside the Dade recount places, where the
<br>
republicans in the room noticed no disturbances. The democrats claimed
<br>
it was a 'riot' only because they didn't like the fact that someone was
<br>
demonstrating 'against' them, which was 'obviously' staged by 'racist,
<br>
bigoted, sexist, right-wing wackos'.
<br>
<p>This is one more instance of a liberal claiming a crime occurs only
<br>
because they 'felt intimidated', not that any actually intimidating
<br>
behavior actually occured. Much like blacks protesting police checking
<br>
for outstanding warrants on the election day. Since felons can't vote,
<br>
its obvious that only those who are felons should be worried about their
<br>
ability to commit vote fraud being impaired.
