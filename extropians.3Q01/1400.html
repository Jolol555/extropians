<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; OK... I would have said this a little differently, but let's take

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; person's right to wealth. Huh?!?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You can see how silly this line gets. This will happen anytime you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; talk about morality in terms of absolutes. This is exactly what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religions do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Miriam, it is quite simple: what IS wealth? What IS money? It is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;symbol of value added by labor. Every dollar in the world represents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;time from someone's life spent sweating their butt when they could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;been smelling the roses. Some people's ideas, decisions, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leadership
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;skills are immensely valuable, so some people make more money than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;So the question is: in a society that abhors slavery, what is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rationale for confiscating the labor of free individuals? I have yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hear anyone come up with an explaination why enslaving 100% of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;population 10% of the time is any less morally abhorrent than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enslaving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;10% of the people 100% of the time. If you can come up with a morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and logically consistent answer to this, I am all ears. Nobody else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to date.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I prefer to see govt as management running a jointly owned place of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business --  the USA (england etc).  People vote for the management
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much as stockholders vote for management.
</em><br>
<p>But stockholders don't get billed, and customers always have a choice of
<br>
the services they wish to receive or not, and are billed according to
<br>
what services they demand and use. Here, it is those who use the
<br>
services least that pay the most, and those that use the most that pay
<br>
the least. That is NOTHING like a jointly owned place of business.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is the rationale for the the management of this place of business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throwing-out/fining  some owner who refuses to pay his share of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintenance fees? Same thing, etc....
</em><br>
<p>Only if the owner agrees to receive the services offered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You may well argue that the fees are misspent; no doubt there is such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in any large corporation; but if you don't like the situation, you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave (or try to change it).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Slaves can't leave; they are chained. Taxpayers who don't like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintenance fees, can leave....no chains!
</em><br>
<p>And go where, exactly? And there certainly ARE chains: you don't get to
<br>
leave with your net worth, generally half of your assets are seized (if
<br>
not all with many countries) when you leave. We even have such a law
<br>
here in the US (passed, of course, during the Clinton administration).
