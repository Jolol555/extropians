<p>
Folks,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warning, I've got some spoilers contained herein.
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course it had some good parts to it, but the ultimate final
<br>
conclusion was completely absurd.  Here you have an advanced race of
<br>
beings that has achieved the ability to do things like obtain a
<br>
perfect history and/or resurrect and restore any being that has ever
<br>
existed.  So - imagine any human being resurrected by these future
<br>
mechs.  Not only can they also restore all your friends and family,
<br>
but they can give you anything you want, answer most any question you
<br>
have ever had....  Yet for some reason - at the end of the first day -
<br>
we're going to be disinterested in all this, get tired, fall asleep
<br>
and die and no God no matter how powerful could ever resurrect us
<br>
again or be able to do any better?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anders said: &quot;In a way it is a coldly logical story, albeit
<br>
with some romantic twists.&quot;  But to me, the above is not only cold,
<br>
but utterly illogical.  How can any such make any sense at all?  And
<br>
other's claimed this wasn't a &quot;deathist&quot; movie.  But to me the above
<br>
kind of illogical cold and stupid thinking is the very definition of
<br>
deathist.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, like ALL other popular discussion of the future, it is
<br>
entirely based on the &quot;Turing test&quot; view of lonely consciously
<br>
isolated beings.  The view that we will eternally never really know
<br>
what other conscious minds are like other than the causal behavior we
<br>
can observe.  Is the boy really feeling pain?  Or is he just a tape
<br>
recorder begging for the pain to stop?  The assumption is that no one
<br>
will ever know.  This is my pet peeve and there is no way the future
<br>
can be like this.  The worlds of our consciousness will expand and
<br>
escape from our skulls.  We will be effing, sharing, merging, and
<br>
getting inside other's minds.  Hence the future will be very different
<br>
than all this Turring test like behavior.  Surely even the idea of
<br>
individual beings will really no longer exist in the distant future.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another utterly stupid assumption the entire plot hinged on
<br>
was the idea that once the mother spoke the special words to the
<br>
android boy, it would suddenly drastically change him and forever lock
<br>
him into the mind set of only loving the person that spoke the words.
<br>
The only thing that could be done to change such would be to destroy
<br>
the boy.  It's difficult for us to alter ourselves, but it's absurd to
<br>
think that an android couldn't be modified.  Of course in reality,
<br>
even humans will be changing and altering themselves and ultimately
<br>
being uplifted, modified and improved in drastic ways.  Why would an
<br>
android have to go to talk to &quot;Dr. Know&quot; like he did?  Surely he would
<br>
be able to, if he didn't already have it - purchase and install a
<br>
direct interface into the world of all internet knowledge...
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hated it.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brent Allsop
