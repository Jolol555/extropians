</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because in a racist society, black people are more likely to be arrested,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convicted and executed than white people. Black people make up a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disproportionate number of recruits to the US armed forces, am I to assume
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Am I to assume that you think someone makes them enlist at gunpoint?
<br>
What does that have to do with blacks being convicted more? Nothing,
<br>
clearly, outside of a lack of avenues of escape from the ghetto. Having
<br>
been a member of the US armed forces myself, it is partly that, and
<br>
partly that fewer whites think that risking one's life in the service is
<br>
worth minimum wage pay and two tiered health care systems with a higher
<br>
rate of malpractice than the general medical industry, with less legal
<br>
recourse. I went in for the college money (the GI Bill), which they
<br>
wound up defrauding me of once I was discharged.
<br>
<p>Whites also don't join the military in similar numbers because whites
<br>
tend to have a higher respect for higher education than blacks and are
<br>
better prepared for college than blacks. In the words of black comedian
<br>
Chris Rock: &quot;Cut the 'racism' bullshit, and get off your ass.&quot;
