<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Olga, relax.  &quot;Mexican&quot; is the word in English for people from Mexico.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so happens that in LA and Houston and, I guess from Brian's post, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Atlanta,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the most numerous population of recent immigrants who are just starting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the socio-economic ladder are from Mexico.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I understand about the word &quot;Mexican&quot; - there's nothing wrong with that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;word
</em><br>
<em>&gt;per se
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any more than using the word &quot;Portuguese&quot; or &quot;Thai&quot; or &quot;French,&quot; but I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reacting to the WAY it was used ... and not so much in Brian Atkin's case
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I had some questions, to which Brian kindly replied just before he plonked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me).  If you will recall, in tandem I pasted in something from Natasha's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recent post:  &quot;At first, only those with money or connections had them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Today, in downtown Los Angeles, there are more Mexicans using cell phones
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than executives.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What was the implication in that sentence?  That once upon a time when cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phones were expensive they had a certain cachet as only rich hoity-toity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;CEOs could get their hands on them; but now these formerly exclusive handy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;little gadgets have become so cheap and plentiful that &quot;Mexicans&quot; have them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Mexicans in this case standing for a catch-all word meaning what? -- poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people? riff-raff? the hoi-polloi? illegal aliens?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I was wondering how that would read if the sentence were altered slightly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;i.e.:  &quot;At first, only those with money or connections had them.  Today, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;downtown Los Angeles, there are more Asians using cell phones than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;executives&quot;; or &quot;... there are more blacks using cell phones than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;executives&quot;; or &quot;there are more Jews using cell phones than executives.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you were Asian, black or Jewish - how would you react to a sentence like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that?  Again, what is the implication here (using what I wrote in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paragraph as an example):  That there are no Jewish executives?  That 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Asians
</em><br>
<em>&gt;couldn't afford cell phones until cell phones came down in price (implying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there are no rich Asians)?  That there are no professional black people?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I had the same question when I read the sentence about &quot;Mexicans&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Natasha's post.  I lived in San Diego for 8 years, and got to know a number
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Mexican-Americans who were lawyers, teachers, executives, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physicians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Even though this was 20 years ago (when I lived in San Diego) I could just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imagine their reaction if they'd read Natasha's sentence about &quot;Mexicans&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;How ignorant.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Maybe Natasha meant &quot;poor people.&quot;  Maybe she meant &quot;illegal aliens&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;immigrants.&quot;  I'm not sure what Natasha meant, but I don't think she 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meant to say &quot;Mexicans.&quot;  Not all Mexicans are poor, for one thing, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there ARE Mexican executives.  So it seems prudent  not to characterize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Mexicans&quot; in an offset example to &quot;executives,&quot; any more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;characterizing Jews, blacks, or Asians in the same way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually where I live, housing construction continues to boom to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point where if we didn't have all those Mexicans moving here we'd be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a real shortage of labor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Brian's point about having lots of inexpensive labor supplied by a huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pool &gt; of immigrants from El Sud in the US raises an important point: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Unlike
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Japan, &gt; we don't have the same incentives to roboticize a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entry-level jobs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Greg, this is a good point.  The only icky feeling I got from Brian Atkin's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;post is in the wording he used regarding &quot;all those Mexicans.&quot;  These are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people - not just some amorphous source of &quot;cheap labor.&quot;  It seems to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that if anyone can be kind, appreciative and compassionate about a group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;laborers, it is people with seemingly every privilege in the world going 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them - leisure time, money, brains and power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What you said about roboticizing entry-level jobs makes sense to me.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;while we are still using people to do our dangerous, exhausting, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;low-paying,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;low status&quot; types of jobs, can we show some compassion and humanity?  Can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we treat people who are willing to do our hard labor with respect as our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fellow human beings, and not refer to them dismissively as &quot;all those [fill
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in appropriate nationality blank].&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't know if Extroprians or the Singularity Institute has a SIG which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;addresses social concerns and damage control in the here and now (before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity).  If not, I would suggest starting one.  Brian Atkins has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already made it known that he doesn't &quot;have time for PC crap. Why not take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it somewhere else and waste their time with it?&quot;  (I understand, he is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;busy guy.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Let me end by saying - and I don't mean to be churlish, but -- I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;somewhere else&quot; is already here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Olga
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the immigration of all those mexican peasants does indeed matter 
<br>
to us all, especially those of us who are planning to be frozen if old age 
<br>
aint cured pretty soon.  The substantial MAJORITY of immigrants, mexicans or 
<br>
otherwise, are &quot;peasants.&quot;  From my observations, peasants don't run much of 
<br>
a country. Mainly, they live in kleptocracies. I don't want the USA to be a 
<br>
kleptocracy. I doubt cryonics would be legal for the common man in the USA 
<br>
were uneducated peasants to abound in the USA.
<br>
<p>Another thing, no one really invited them, except those that make money from 
<br>
them, and that is really the minority in the USA. YOu say my own ancestors 
<br>
were immigrants, too? That is a non sequitir: I may own a house, and at some 
<br>
point in the past, I did not own that house. Does that make it OK for 
<br>
someone else to move in without my permission?
<br>
<p>If you are going to have immigrants, at least get educated ones. And then, 
<br>
in that case, you have serious concerns about them competing with current 
<br>
citizens for jobs. We own this country, we get to voice our own opinions 
<br>
freely, and we get to make the rules. The kinds of countries where common 
<br>
men do not get to make the rules and voice opinions....that is the kind of 
<br>
country from whence the peasants came.  Let them stay in their beds, etc...
<br>
<p>Another thing, most of the mexican immigrants are indians, and they are the 
<br>
uneducated peasants who get the grunt work that would be going to US 
<br>
citizens otherwise.  I am part indian, so therefore by the current calculus 
<br>
of racial political correctness, I get to criticise them.
