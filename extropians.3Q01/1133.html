( Michael B. Hubbard asks for comments about his speech. ) 
<br>
<p>I think that it's very, very good!
<br>
<p>The only sentence that I have any trouble at all with is
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While replacement parts are becoming more common, my personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief is that it is better to have the original factory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equipment until something truly better arrives.
</em><br>
<p>The rest of your speech is glib---in a good way, mind---but this sentence is rather
<br>
too glib.  In the first place, it contains considerably more meat, and hence is
<br>
considerably more controversial than the rest.  (One of its hidden implications is
<br>
that when something better than our current organs does come along, you'll replace
<br>
your organs with it!)  Something makes me uneasy about trying to slip something as
<br>
wild as that past people.  But I could be wrong.

<p>Hello all!
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I've got speech for my local toastmasters group, and was wondering if anyone would
<br>
care to critique it. It's more in the style of a motivational speech than anything
<br>
really technical. I'm using the TM group as a test-bed for some ideas on how to
<br>
spread the extropian meme through public-speaking, and would welcome any observations
<br>
the list might have.
<br>
<p>Live well, Michael Awakening the Sleeper
<br>
<p>An anonymous Internet pundit once wrote, &quot;The world is so fast that there are days
<br>
when the person who says it can't be done is interrupted by the person who is doing
<br>
it.&quot; It doesn't take much looking around these days to see that world is changing on
<br>
multiple fronts at breakneck speed. The Human Genome has been mapped. Computers are
<br>
becoming more powerful, smaller, and omnipresent. On the societal front the change is
<br>
no less dizzying. The nations of Europe have become the European Union. China has
<br>
broken out of its formerly third-world status to become a real potential rival to the
<br>
United States. We hear of protests and revolutions all over the world on what seems
<br>
to be a daily basis. In the financial world we move from being in the longest
<br>
sustained boom of the twentieth century to the troubled market we now see each night
<br>
on CNBC. The one constant of our times, it seems, is change. And frankly, more and
<br>
greater changes are approaching than we could have formerly even conceived.
<br>
<p>So how do we, as human beings living in the age of change, cope with the constant
<br>
barrage of new information, and the constantly shifting state of the world? My answer
<br>
is that we ourselves must change, even transform, to face the challenges of our day.
<br>
As Frank Herbert wrote in his epic novel Dune, &quot;&quot;Without change, something sleeps
<br>
inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.&quot; I believe that we must
<br>
awaken the sleeping giants within ourselves to survive and thrive in this dawning age
<br>
of change. But what changes must we face?
<br>
<p>First we have to be prepared to live longer. In 1990 there were just over 3 million
<br>
people in the United States age 85 or older. In the past ten years that number has
<br>
risen by nearly a million and a half. The numbers for 75 to 84 have increased by two
<br>
million. We as a nation are living longer, and living fuller and more productive
<br>
lives as we age, than we have in any point in history. Medical technology has
<br>
advanced enough, even assuming no further growth in knowledge, that it is very likely
<br>
that most if not all of the people in this room could live to see one hundred years
<br>
or better.
<br>
<p>Next, be prepared for a more prosperous world. Over the next thirty years there will
<br>
be an unprecedented boom in production worldwide, ensuring a worldwide standard of
<br>
living and relative comfort never before possible. As a result, our energies will be
<br>
turned to creating and exploring on a level not seen since the European renaissance.
<br>
As the cost of travel across the globe decreases and the flow of information
<br>
increases, there will be more opportunity for those who wish to travel to do so, and
<br>
more contact with people from different cultures both face to face and on the
<br>
Internet.
<br>
<p>Finally, be prepared for more choice in nearly every aspect of life. Already choices
<br>
of lifestyle and occupation are more diverse than ever before, and the byproduct is
<br>
an ever-increasing tolerance of those choices. As productivity increases the trend
<br>
toward more free time and more money to spend on that time will only increase
<br>
correspondingly.
<br>
<p>So how do we prepare ourselves for these changes? First, take care of your body, and
<br>
try to expand your physical capabilities. While replacement parts are becoming more
<br>
common, my personal belief is that it is better to have the original factory
<br>
equipment until something truly better arrives. Secondly, take care of your mind, and
<br>
expand it whenever possible. Learn languages, take courses, follow whatever interests
<br>
you may have, but continue to learn and expand your brainpower. In a world dominated
<br>
by change and possibility a flexible and well-trained mind is one of the best tools
<br>
you can have. Finally, strive for self-direction in every aspect of your own life.
<br>
Make goals, make decisions, seek out freedom and openness. I can't tell you exactly
<br>
how you should individually each prepare for and cope with the coming changes in our
<br>
world, as Franklin Roosevelt said, &quot;There are many ways of going forward, but only
<br>
one way of standing still.&quot; What I can tell you, though, is to strive to improve and
<br>
expand yourself in any way you feel is right for you. Challenge yourself to learn and
<br>
grow. Awaken your sleeper.
