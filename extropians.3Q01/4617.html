<p>Hi Matt
<br>
<p>Not sure if you've seen this one already but here goes.  Quite where 
<br>
the anti-capitalists are going to get a thermonuclear bomb from isn't 
<br>
explained in the article but surely such a device would compromise 
<br>
their &quot;Neo-Luddite&quot; principles anyway?
<br>
<p>Yours, in a fallout shelter, somewhere west of London

<p><p>TOP FIRMS RETREAT INTO BUNKER TO WARD OFF 'ANARCHISTS'
<br>
<p>&quot;Some of Britain's biggest companies are running their Internet 
<br>
operations on systems installed in a 300ft-deep nuclear blast-proof 
<br>
bunker to protect customers from violent anti-capitalist campaigners. 
<br>
They are renting space in hermetically sealed rooms capable of 
<br>
withstanding a one Kiloton explosion, electro-magnetic 'pulse bombs', 
<br>
electronic eavesdropping and chemical and biological warfare.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is from an article by Steve Boggan in the The Independent, 13 June
<br>
2001 -
<br>
<p><a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/digital/update/story.jsp?story=77374">http://news.independent.co.uk/digital/update/story.jsp?story=77374</a>:
<br>
<p>It seems that hundreds of companies have already installed systems in 
<br>
The Bunker - formerly known as RAF Ash, outside Sandwich in Kent - 
<br>
and dozens more are understood to be queuing up for space.
<br>
<p>The article quotes a  Dr Ian Angell, professor of information systems 
<br>
at the London School of Economics and author of The New Barbarian 
<br>
Manifesto, as saying: &quot;This isn't paranoia or fantasy, this is the 
<br>
future. There are sophisticated anti-capitalists out there who feel a 
<br>
great deal of resentment against the business world. These are the 
<br>
new Luddites and, given half a chance, they would smash the machine 
<br>
to pieces.&quot;
<br>
<p>Behind The Bunker is a company called AL Digital Communications, 
<br>
established by the brothers Adam and Ben Laurie and Dominic Hawken. 
<br>
&quot;The AL Digital team made a sealed bid - still secret, according to 
<br>
the Ministry of Defence - and the 60,000sq ft bunker with 18 acres of 
<br>
land was theirs,&quot; writes Boggan.
<br>
<p>There are three back-up power systems big enough to fire up a small 
<br>
town. There is also a fire station, vast underground fuel and water 
<br>
tanks and an array of cameras on corridors and servers.
<br>
<p>&quot;You have to understand. Future wars will be fought by capitalists 
<br>
and anti-capitalists as society polarises,&quot; Professor Angell is 
<br>
reported as saying. &quot;When that happens, control of information will 
<br>
be as important as control of territory used to be in conventional 
<br>
conflicts. If you can stop your enemy from destroying your 
<br>
information, then you have a good chance of winning the war.&quot;
