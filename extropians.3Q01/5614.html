<p>Correct. He isn't -- quite -- a member of the Scottish Socialist Party,
<br>
but he grew up in and messed around in left-wing Scottish fringe politics
<br>
and has kept a keen interest in all sorts of fringe parties. And he goes
<br>
drinking with the local libertarians on occasion, where they bicker good-
<br>
naturedly about politics. But fringe is fringe ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Forgive my ignorance, but
</em><br>

<p>There is no Movement. However, let's see ... Iain Banks and Ken MacLeod
<br>
went to school together and egged each other on; it's just that Ken is
<br>
less prolific and took longer to break through into print. Al Reynolds
<br>
and Steve Baxter are getting lots of coverage, as is Peter Hamilton,
<br>
but again: there's no movement. What there is is Interzone, which began
<br>
publishing quarterly in 1979 and is now a monthly magazine. Interzone gave
<br>
a lot of writers their first break into print and there's a discernable
<br>
&quot;Interzone generation&quot; in British SF -- probably two-thirds of the
<br>
writers to make it since 1980 came through that magazine. (Myself included.)
