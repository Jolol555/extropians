<em>&gt; But this is not a concept of human nature you can build a philosophy on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - it can't answer questions like: are humans rational? what is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essence of being human? If a machine if generous, is it human? Why does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology develop? This is rather a description from a economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materialist perspective how certain behaviors have become more common,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a concept of what it means to be a human.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not comfortable with this philosophical approach of seeking to
<br>
understand the world at the level of humanity and its nature.  It's not
<br>
clear to me that this is the right level of abstraction to advance our
<br>
understanding.
<br>
<p>It is true, we are human.  And as humans we generally share certain
<br>
characteristics.  Coming to a better understanding of these shared
<br>
features is an advance in knowledge.
<br>
<p>But that is not the only level at which we can understand ourselves.
<br>
We can look both higher and lower.
<br>
<p>At the higher (more abstract) level, we are not just humans, we are
<br>
primates.  We are mammals.  We are animals.  We are living beings.
<br>
We are physical entities existing in the universe.  All of these facts
<br>
shed light on our nature and our existence.
<br>
<p>At the lower level, we are members of a certain culture and/or
<br>
civilization.  We are residents of a geographical region.  We are
<br>
members of a family.  We are individuals with our own life history.
<br>
And we are particular moments of conscious experience in time.
<br>
<p>I don't see that singling out the primate-to-human boundary in this
<br>
hierarchy is the only place to look for sources as to our highest nature.
<br>
It is true that this is a fairly extreme boundary, one with significant
<br>
differences on one side and the other.  So it does provide considerable
<br>
knowledge and insight.  But it's not the only one.
<br>
<p>Putting it bluntly, I don't see that my highest goal in life should
<br>
necessarily be the advancement of reason, simply because that trait
<br>
happens to distinguish humanity from apekind.  I feel under no obligation
<br>
to exaggerate my differences from the apes and to preferentially develop
<br>
those traits that distinguish me from them.  It may be that I want to
<br>
develop my reasoning abilities, but it's not because of any deficiencies
<br>
on the part of apes!
<br>
<p>If there were other species around that were also intelligent, would
<br>
we then say that humanity's purpose was no longer the advancement of
<br>
rationality, but rather, perhaps, the advancement of singing ability
<br>
(supposing the other intelligent species didn't sing)?
<br>
<p>This all smacks of an argument from intelligent design, that each organism
<br>
was created with a place and purpose in the world, and we have to discover
<br>
that purpose.  By that argument it's logical to look at how you differ
<br>
from other organisms in order to learn what the purpose was which you
<br>
were put here to fulfill.  But with a truer understanding of the nature
<br>
of life, we know that there is no such purpose.  Comparing ourselves
<br>
with other species does not tell us how we should live.
