<p>&lt;&lt; Likewise, those of us who cautiously upload,
<br>
&nbsp;and prudently run lots of more primitive versions of ourselves
<br>
&nbsp;in the background, will leave far behind the Amish, or even those
<br>
&nbsp;that have a less burning desire to become more intelligent.
<br>
&nbsp;Thus disparity (and diversity) will increase.

<br>
But not necessarily, more suffering, more frustration, more envy. Its just 
<br>
that the human species clades-off, all the better to colonize what may be an 
<br>
&quot;intellectually&quot; dead universe. Contrary to the science fiction of the day, 
<br>
interstellar space will not be habitated by dreamy-eyed farm lads. It takes a 
<br>
heap o' technology, to make an interplanetary or interstellar home. I was 
<br>
reading Larry Niven's recent Destiny's Road, yesterday, and had to stop. 
<br>
Yokels making it on another world around another sun are charming, but less 
<br>
plausible then in days of old.
<br>
<p>Getting back to the uploads, issue; I suspect that if there is a chance at 
<br>
brain replacement surgery (as suggested by astrophysicist Michael Hart) 
<br>
people will hearken to this quicker, until the bugs get tested out of some 
<br>
neural net that will be the repository for a &quot;decanted&quot; human personality. 
<br>
Why I feel this may be so is because the philosophical, ship of Theseus 
<br>
(parts get replaced, now is this the same ship?), is at least, this is an 
<br>
older conceptual problem. At any rate that's what opinions are for, and the 
<br>
wild, woolly, ways of the world rule, not I. Which would you chose if you 
<br>
could, brain replacement or the net, 1st?
