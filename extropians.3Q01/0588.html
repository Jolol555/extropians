<em>&gt; &gt; On a logical level, Lee makes and excellent case that hiding from the world

<em>&gt; &gt; Governments should be prevented from interfering with their citizens' lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; National security should come from a position of strength and defense rather

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However, I'm not sure that we will ever reach that level.  Mike feels safe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because he has a gun.  I feel safe because my computers have firewalls, IDS,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; encryption and anti-virus.  Eliezer feels safe because AIs are programmed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be friendly.  Will we ever be so safe that we drop our guards?  Or will we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; always need to keep our safety protocols in place to maintain the safety
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that we desire?  I am betting on the latter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Safety is a statistical concept. Just as I argued for friendly AIs, what we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want is as much safety as we can get, but we will have to accept that it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be perfect.
</em><br>
<p>We also have to look at how that safety is implemented. A top down,
<br>
state centered (or cnetered) approach is what comes from weak smart
<br>
contracts that are constructed on the premise that individuals are
<br>
untrustable but institutions made up of individuals are trustable. Such
<br>
state centered security contracts invariably result in fascist
<br>
repression as they follow Acton's Law. Arming only the state's police
<br>
force is a low trust social contract. Mandating state controlled means
<br>
of disabling private guns is also a low trust social contract. Imposing
<br>
these controls states that individuals do not trust each other to begin
<br>
with, as a default.
<br>
<p>Conversely, security contracts in society that are based upon the high
<br>
trust principle of 'innocent until proven guilty' are centered on trust
<br>
of the individual and pseudotrust of institutions (because under Acton's
<br>
Law, institutions are attractors of corruption, and therefore need to be
<br>
watched over by armed and vigilant citizens). Arming the citizenry is a
<br>
high trust social contract between individuals. That I am armed does not
<br>
mean I don't trust my fellow citizens, merely that I am willing to trust
<br>
anyone who does not point a gun at me. The gun is a fallback position
<br>
for the rare instance that trust fails.
<br>
<p>Similarly, giving the government the power to posess your private key to
<br>
your computer system is also a low trust social contract, and allowing
<br>
individuals to control their own key administration without government
<br>
oversight is a high trust social contract. 
<br>
<p>The difficulty in the area of computer technology is that with
<br>
remoteness and anonymity, it becomes difficult to impose consequences in
<br>
the event of a breach of trust (as with the gun analogy, I can impose
<br>
consequences immediately if someone breaches trust in person, but not
<br>
across the net). The threat of consequences is of paramount importance
<br>
in maintaining high trust in a society. If the legal system is distorted
<br>
so badly that most criminals either escape apprehension or conviction,
<br>
or if they are insufficiently punished for their breach of trust, they
<br>
will find a positive cost benefit sum in their risk calculations, and
<br>
will commit breaches of trust.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think Brin makes a good point in the transparent society (which is often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overlooked as we get into the crypto-vs-camera escalation discussions) that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the important think is keeping the society open and healthy. That is the main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal. Privacy might be important but is really just a means for making a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society worth living in, and there might be reasons to regard other means for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keeping society nice as more important. Accountability is of course the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious one; it can to a large extent deal with the above-mentioned problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on various levels.
</em><br>
<p>The only redeeming feature of transparency is that it allows us to live
<br>
in each other's skin, in a manner of speaking. The problem in high trust
<br>
societies is that they must remain relatively homogenous. We essentially
<br>
have circles of trust in our lives, and we assign trust ratings to
<br>
strangers based on preliminary evaluations of where in our trust circles
<br>
they seem most apt. Someone who fits into our family very well earns
<br>
high trust. Those who are strange looking or behaving do not. 
<br>
<p>We also assign trust based on media programming, as has been shown with
<br>
studies of school kids and adults of various races responding to
<br>
pictures of black and white people with trust ratings. It turns out that
<br>
blacks in the US in fact tend to trust white people more than black
<br>
people, and women trust men more than other women. This helps explain
<br>
the prevalence and persistence of white males in positions of leadership
<br>
in the US despite huge gains in equal opportunity for blacks and women.
<br>
<p>Transparency does allow for individuals to experience the lives of
<br>
others who are different from themselves and learn that we are all far
<br>
more similar, and therefore trustable, than our instincts and ignorance
<br>
based fears tell us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imperfect societies can be made liveable if we add the right feedback loops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to reward nice behavior and punish bad behavior (they don't even have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put into place centrally, quite a few are Hayekian spontaneous orders like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unwritten rules of courtesy and neighbourhood relations). This will not turn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them perfect, but change the probabilities of things happening (sometimes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very large degrees). 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, consequences are of paramount importance. They will be far more
<br>
important with transparency, but they must be imposed on a person to
<br>
person basis. If transparency wins, we must significantly reduce the
<br>
degree of control the state has over the justice system and increase
<br>
personal ajudication.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm less convinced about that &quot;barriers&quot;, things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intended to prevent certain actions from being taken (like encryptions, locks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and pre-progammed friendliness), can produce the liveable society. In some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations they work by making costs of ill-doing high (it is harder to read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; en encrypted file or pick a lock than it would be without the barrier), but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't see them helping to reward nice behavior.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I don't know. I think continued existence is a very nice reward for
<br>
being a nice person.
