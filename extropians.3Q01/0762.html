Frederick Mann forwards a long article from an unspecified URL
<br>
about Parrondo's paradox.  Some of the material about Brownian
<br>
ratchets was also covered in July's Scientific American.
<br>
<p>A few comments:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Parrondo invented two coin-tossing games to embody the essential elements of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the flashing ratchet, and summoned his collaborator, the engineer Derek
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Abbott of the University of Adelaide in Australia, who was delighted with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Parrondo's innovation....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The outcome of a single coin toss in either of the two games is identical:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;win the toss and gain a dollar, lose the toss and give back a dollar. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;player begins with some random number of dollars. In the first game the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;player tosses a coin weighted so that the odds of winning are slightly less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than 50 percent. In the second game two weighted coins are in play: the odds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of winning with the first coin are nearly 75 percent in the player's favor;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the odds of winning with the second coin are less than 10 percent. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;player gets to toss the favorable coin whenever his pool of money is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;multiple of three. He must toss the unfavorable coin whenever his pool of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;money is a multiple of three.
</em><br>
<p>This result has been widely reported as &quot;if you can switch between
<br>
two losing games you can make them winning games&quot;.  The problem with
<br>
this interpretation lies in the last sentence above, where the rules
<br>
depend on how big your pool of money is.  No real games behave this way.
<br>
This is the crux of the unintuitive result.
<br>
<p>I came up with a trivial example of two losing games which become winners
<br>
if you can switch between them.  Game 1: if your cash balance is even,
<br>
you win 1.  If it's odd, you lose 2.  Game 2 is the opposite: if your
<br>
balance is odd, you win 1; if it's even you lose 2.
<br>
<p>Both games 1 and 2 are obvious long term losers.  You win at most 1
<br>
the first time, then you lose 2 forever.  But by alternating between
<br>
them, game 1 when your balance is even, game 2 when it's odd, you win
<br>
every time.
<br>
<p>Does this prove anything?  Not really.  These aren't games as we usually
<br>
think of them, because real games don't have this peculiar dependency
<br>
on the size of your wallet.  That's the only reason we are able to get
<br>
this odd result.  But if we accept games that work this way, my games
<br>
show the result far more clearly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The physicist Sergei Maslov of Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has shown that principles similar to Parrondo's paradox can be applied to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the stock market. Maslov found a way that the value of a stock portfolio can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increase even if all of its stocks decline in the long run: The entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;portfolio must be sold periodically - even daily - and the proceeds must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quickly plowed back into repurchasing the stocks in the same proportions as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they were in the original portfolio.
</em><br>
<p>This strategy of portfolio rebalancing is nothing new, indeed it is
<br>
almost universally recommended, although of course not at the time
<br>
scale described here.  Conventional investment advice is to divvy up
<br>
your investment assets into groups, decide on a percentage investment
<br>
in each group, and to periodically rebalance your portfolio when the
<br>
percentages get out of line due to price changes.
<br>
<p>This works especially well in cyclical market conditions, where the
<br>
&quot;hot&quot; investment varies from time to time.  The rebalancing makes
<br>
you automatically tend to buy low and sell high.
<br>
<p>The main alternative strategy is buy and hold.  In the long run, if one
<br>
type of investment drastically outpaces others, then if you had even a
<br>
small part of your pool invested in it initially, its share will grow
<br>
over time and eventually you gain much of the benefit of its growth.
<br>
<p>In practice people often pick a mix of these two strategies, doing
<br>
some rebalancing but allowing their portfolio to gradually become more
<br>
concentrated in particular investments which continue to do well over
<br>
a long period.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Some investigators have proposed recently that so-called motor proteins,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which haul microscopic cargo, might operate in part by a ratchet mechanism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In 1993 a team of engineers at Harvard University and the Rowland Institute
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for Science in Cambridge, Massachusetts, tracked the movements of the motor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protein kinesin. That protein moves by propelling itself along cellular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;train tracks&quot; called microtubules, and can transport cargo more than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hundred times its size - much like an ant carrying an enormous cake crumb.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The team discovered that instead of moving smoothly along the microtubule,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kinesin makes distinct jumps, each about eight nanometers long, as if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were climbing the rungs of a ladder.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Those discrete jumps led Martin Bier and Dean Astumian, a colleague of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bier's at the University of Chicago, to hypothesize that a ratchet-like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;engine was at work.
</em><br>
<p>The Scientific American article discussed this; see also
<br>
<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2001-06/aaft-wpn062701.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2001-06/aaft-wpn062701.php</a> which
<br>
presents a more conventional view of the kinesin motor.
<br>
<p>This raises a question with regard to nanotech designs.  Suppose it
<br>
turns out that nature is widely using Brownian motors.  Does this
<br>
suggest that the current approach to nanotech by Drexler et al is
<br>
fundamentally misguided?  His designs are based closely on macroscale
<br>
machinery: conveyor belts, presses, bearings.  Few of them depend in any
<br>
way on Brownian motion. In fact his term &quot;eutectic&quot; means that all the
<br>
molecules are on controlled paths.  The only place you have Brownian
<br>
effects is when they have to interface to the messy outside world.
<br>
But once material has been palletized and brought inside, it is controlled
<br>
just like the assembly line at Ford.
<br>
<p>It could be that this whole approach is wrongheaded and unlikely
<br>
to succeed.  We may have to rethink how nanotech should work.
<br>
Maybe probability needs to be an essential step.  Maybe the assembly
<br>
line needs to take two steps backwards for every three steps forward.
<br>
It has been known for some time that this can lead to more efficient
<br>
designs, by exploiting thermodynamic reversibility (see threads from
<br>
last month on reversible Brownian computers).
<br>
<p>All those Drexlerian gears and arms may be obsolete before they are
<br>
ever used.  Truly effective nanotech might do better to copy nature and
<br>
adopt probabilistic, Brownian methodology.
