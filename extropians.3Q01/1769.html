<p>&lt;&lt; Better: upload someone, and ask the *upload* if it thinks it feels like
<br>
&nbsp;before.  &gt;&gt;
<br>
What you've done here, is merely to create a clone, whose experiences will 
<br>
soon vastly diverge from the original, living, being. This, to me is 
<br>
unsatisfactory, since all he, she, or it, is a carbon copy. Not good. Why not 
<br>
good? Because it messes with Pattern Identity Theory, now there are two 
<br>
patterns, one which is less valid then the other, the copy. If the original's 
<br>
electrons (?) were transmitted to the Magic Eternal-Life Network; and there 
<br>
was no living being left behind, that would be what we need.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Sure. If you create an emulation of a mind, then you will also get all
<br>
the bugs and quirks. Stopping smoking as an upload could probably be
<br>
easier, since you could treat the withdrawal directly.--

<p>This is very decent, as long as the previously, elucidated complaint is 
<br>
accomplished.
