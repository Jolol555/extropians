<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This list has totally lost its perspective.  As extropians, who *do* have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long-term agenda last I checked, there are two ways to address this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular threat, a threat that is far more complicated than any simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis will solve anyway.  The first way is to eliminate it in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offensive fashion, actively destroying it so that it has minimal ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damage us.  The second is a defensive mode, minimizing the ability of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat to harm us if it chooses to engage us.  But like in so many things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality decides these things for us by and large.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You make some good points except for one thing.  We are not just *extropians*.
<br>
We are also people who are justifiably upset, concerned and intent on making
<br>
some sense out of what is happening.  In the process we will, among other
<br>
things, play amateur analyst and amateur general and amateur diplomat attempting
<br>
to make sense of it all.  This is not a total waste.  It is one way of seeing
<br>
multiple aspects of the situation and coming to some grips with it.  It 
<br>
probably is a waste and a large one to tell people they should not do this
<br>
because they are *extropians* or for any other reason.  This is a community and
<br>
the community is reeling a bit like a lot of communities.  Helping it find
<br>
its grounding in the kind of community it is is certainly good.  Dunning it
<br>
for reeling isn't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The reality is that extropians have no real business discussing offensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measures because, quite frankly, extropians have negligible impact on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massive engine of inertia that is government policy, particularly with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues like this.  The world turns as the world turns.  Offering platitudes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as to who/what/when/where should be attacked in the Middle East is nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than emotional masturbation, and offers nothing constructive that could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be construed as defending an extropian future.  I could get this on a dozen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other sites, and the quality would be better in some cases.  There *is* some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causality at work here; if extropians actually had something of substantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value to add in this regard then they might also be in a position to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence it.  But from where I sit, we are often indistinguishable from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-rise yuppie or a trailer park yokel, value-wise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What, you expect us all to be in super-genius mode in every aspect of our 
<br>
communications even in areas we are not specialists in but that have just
<br>
intruded big-time into our lives?  Who the heck are you to put down people
<br>
for this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Which leads me to my second point: hunkering down and spending our time on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things that matter.  If we can agree that as individuals and as a group we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can not effectively and rationally attack this particular threat to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropian future, then it is imperative that we think of how to accomplish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our goals in the shadow of great threats (and the forces that counter them)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for which we have limited preemptive offensive capabilities.  And by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;rationally&quot;, I mean taking a long-term view with your ultimate goals in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind.  This is a far more constructive approach for a number of reasons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First of all, it is relatively easy for an individual to ensure their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival and the perpetuation of their goals.  Second, the passive nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these measures take little focus away from our primary goals.  Third,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security and safety is a network effect; the people around you are safer for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your individual effort and may reciprocate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Please explain to me how I can reach my goals if the internet is turned into 
<br>
high security no-hacker land, open source software is all but outlawed, the
<br>
very computer hardware enforces the most brain-dead of IP laws, the government
<br>
sees everything I write, say and do 24x7 and other nasty possible reactions
<br>
to 9/11.  Some of what is likely in the near and long-term as fallout can
<br>
have a very large effect on my work and on the work of most of us here.  
<br>
<p>Explain how we can turn our backs effectively on the world and work to 
<br>
create our &quot;philosopher's stone&quot; be it AI, SI, MNT or whatever and expect
<br>
to actually be able to have any result be a real improvement in that real
<br>
world we have studiously ignored?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; My last and most important point is that extropians are in the business of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating the ultimate trump cards, technologies that can permanently render
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the threats we are facing obsolete.  There are escalating issues and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competing forces today which threaten to severely blunt our goals, thereby
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rendering us helpless to stop even greater threats than those which most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people think about.  The endgame is upon us, and we are in a race against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those that would stop us; if we fail or even slow down too much, we will die
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually.  My goal in surviving isn't to survive another day, but to win
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the game.  
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps &quot;winning the game&quot; is the game to paraphrase an old saying about beating
<br>
the system.  I have asked this before here and not received a very satisfactory
<br>
answer.  Exactly why do we believe that our goals, our endgame, is the
<br>
one that should and must win and that we must make sure it does regardless
<br>
of what the people at large want or even know about?  In a way we are trying
<br>
to sneak in our &quot;final solution&quot; as a fait accompli.  On the one hand it looks
<br>
beautiful and obvious.  On the other, most of us admit that we have no idea
<br>
whether it will mean we all &quot;win&quot; or whether we all simply become obsolete
<br>
and are wiped out of existence.  Yet we should be gung-ho to produce this
<br>
whatever-it-is and whatever-it-does-to-us.  Well, life is not something
<br>
that begins only after the Singularity.
