<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I think deadbeats who bring children into the world without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the means to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;adequately support them should be punished for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; unconscionable abuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;negligence, and the children should be placed with more responsible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;parents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; A few questions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; What of the inalienable right to procreate?  Should that be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; limited only to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the fiscally fit?  Should that right be denied to the poor?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; If so, why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; don't we just sterilize everyone living in poverty until they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; can prove that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; they are financially responsible enough to have the procedure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; reversed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sound a little Orwellian?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you think children would be better off in foster care than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; with their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; loving parents, simply because the parents are poor?  Have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; you ever known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone raised in the foster care system?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; -Zero
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Straw man here as I see it. Just because someone SHOULDNT havent children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;doesnt mean they dont have a right to have them. I personally think you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;shouldnt drink alchol, but you certainly have the right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Definitely a straw man argument.  But I didn't set it up.  I merely pointed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out what a defenseless argument it is.  (For those having difficulty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following: the &quot;straw man&quot; is the argument that people who have kids without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the resources sans subsidization to support them should have their kids
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken away.)
</em><br>
<p>If you are going to treat kids as property, as you seem to be doing,
<br>
then it's an inherent component of property ownership to be responsible
<br>
for the upkeep of your property. If you don't pay property taxes or use
<br>
taxes, your property can be taken away, for example. If you do not
<br>
maintain your property such that it becomes a nuisance to other property
<br>
owners, it can be confiscated from you. If you insist on treating kids
<br>
as property, then there is an indeniable responsibility component to
<br>
ownership of children. If you produce kids (but cannot pay for their
<br>
upkeep to keep them fed, clothed, housed, educated, and socialized such
<br>
that they do not become nuisances to other individuals in the
<br>
community), such that other people (the taxpayers of a welfare system)
<br>
are paying for that upkeep, then they are no longer YOUR kids, they are
<br>
the taxpayer's kids, and you are merely their custodian, a position that
<br>
can be revoked at the whim of the proper owners of the kids in question.
