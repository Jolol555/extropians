<em>&gt; I have never claimed that anyone on the list is racist, but there is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unusually high level of impatience, lack of imagination (of all things!!),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lack of empathy with racial issues, for example. Why is this? I can see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing in the extropian principles that underpins it. Indeed, I don't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see how it follows from libertarianism.
</em><br>
<p>I think it's a reasonably accurate observation, although to be fair I
<br>
suspect that if you looked closely you'd find a relatively small number
<br>
of vocal list members account for the majority of such statements.
<br>
<p>IMO the reason does not have to do with extropianism or libertarianism
<br>
per se.  Rather, it comes down to a sort of bluntness or rudeness, a
<br>
willingness to say things without much care about how it affects other
<br>
people's feelings.
<br>
<p>I suspect that much of the difference you see from other forums is that
<br>
in this list people who have certain kinds of unpopular views feel freer
<br>
to speak their minds.
<br>
<p>If someone came to another list with a sad story about being oppressed
<br>
or misjudged, they'd usually attract a lot of sympathy and concern.
<br>
If someone challenged their account or suggested that they were partially
<br>
responsible, the critic would probably be shouted down.  Especially if
<br>
we imagine it to be a racial situation, in 99% of forums it would be
<br>
almost unthinkable to publicly say anything that could be construed as
<br>
the slightest bit intolerant.
<br>
<p>However, chances are there are people in those lists who are thinking
<br>
such things.  Rightly or wrongly, they look at these situations and they
<br>
think that the victim should take on a share of the responsibility.
<br>
They feel resentful towards the political correctness which seems to
<br>
force everyone to mouth pious slogans.
<br>
<p>The difference, I believe, is that here on this list some of these
<br>
people speak up.  It's not that we necessarily have more people who
<br>
believe that society has gone too far in feeling sorry for victims,
<br>
it's that here people feel that they can talk openly about it.
<br>
<p>Why is this?  I would suggest that it has to do more with the fact that
<br>
the other ideas that we share are already so unpopular and unaccepted.
<br>
People come to extropianism through paths that require them to reject
<br>
the common consensus on a number of moral issues.  They tend to have a
<br>
certain quality of hard-headedness, emphasis on reason, and the will to
<br>
follow the facts wherever they go, whether the result is popular or not.
<br>
<p>Given this, it is not too surprising that list members have a different
<br>
take on a number of social issues.  Hard-headed can look like hard-hearted
<br>
when society's pendulum is swinging towards emotional concern for the
<br>
helpless, which I think is the case if you look at historical trends.
<br>
<p>Again, I want to emphasize that I don't think all extropians have such
<br>
views but I think a significant percentage do.  Here in this forum
<br>
people feel free to say things which are unpopular.  They don't have
<br>
to mince words, they don't have to make careful obeisance to orthodox
<br>
views as is necessary in most public forums.  People are frank and blunt.
<br>
<p>In fact a number of list members pride themselves on rudeness.  I've
<br>
even seen quasi mathematical arguments offered which try to show that
<br>
rude bluntness is the optimal form of social communication.  I don't
<br>
particularly share such views, but I tolerate them.  If you're going to
<br>
hang around here, it's a good idea to grow a thick skin.
<br>
