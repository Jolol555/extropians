<em>&gt; Hi everybody,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My name's Helen, and I've just joined the extropy list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd like to ask a favour: I'm currently in the process of looking for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; informants to help me in my MA dissertation. I'm studying Sociology at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who see themselves, or would refer to themselves as cyborgs. 
</em><br>
<p>While some may take peruile pleasure at seeing themselves as such,
<br>
especially if they are of a socialist or pro-borg bent, some of us do
<br>
not. Like any cutting edge movement, you will have a panoply of
<br>
sentiment along one or more axes of opinion about how things should be
<br>
done. One of which is the collectivist versus the individualist axis.
<br>
The collectivists, obviously, think ideas like Star Trek's 'Borg' and
<br>
other collectivist notions, like Heinlein's Lotus Eaters as the cat's
<br>
pajamas of future development of our species. The individualists, like
<br>
myself, obviously do not, and see self modification and augmentation
<br>
strictly along individualist and/or consensually associative lines.
<br>
<p>The term 'cyborg' has gained significant negative connotations in the
<br>
public gestalt, generally connoting a state of being less than human
<br>
rather than more than human. Any time a cyborg is presented as having
<br>
some more than human ability (generally strength, vision, etc) they are
<br>
also presented has having lost some other greater degree of humanity,
<br>
generally in areas of empathy, emotion, compassion, etc. that is seen as
<br>
not worth the trade-off. This arises from the romantic-primitivist
<br>
idealization of the human form as a peak of perfection in evolution,
<br>
while presenting technology and the logical mind as a fatal flaw within
<br>
the primitive human.
<br>
<p>A large number of us who are extropians tend toward the individualist
<br>
end of the spectrum to one degree or another, while others who hang out
<br>
on this list may have pro-borg sympathies and do not consider themselves
<br>
extropian. None of us are posthuman, anyone who tells you otherwise is a
<br>
charlatan who is trying to co-opt terms. Posthumanity will not exist
<br>
until AI and mind uploading are possible. Transhumans will exist during
<br>
the period of transition. We are 'transhumanists' or 'posthumanists'
<br>
because we advocate that future. That future has not arrived yet. It is
<br>
near.
<br>
<p>You could call individuals with augmentations like limb prosthetics,
<br>
artificial eyes and ears as transhumans, but very early ones, as you
<br>
would consider homo erectus to be 'human'. The true 'trans' won't occur
<br>
until those prosthetics enable people to exceed normal human
<br>
performance. What is interesting are a few people who are either born or
<br>
are injured without use of a limb that are intentionally having the
<br>
healthy but unresponsive limbs amputated in order to use functional
<br>
prosethetics instead. The piece on television the other night about
<br>
these technologies is rather interesting. One amputee expects better
<br>
than human performance soon, with legs that resemble the digitigrade
<br>
limbs of cats rather than human legs. When they exceed human
<br>
performance, I expect they will demand that the paralympics and Olympics
<br>
be combined, with reactionary luddite groups demanding that any
<br>
prosthetics must use the same mechanical techniques as human limbs.
