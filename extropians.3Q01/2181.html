<p><em>&gt;#### You did not address the specific example I mentioned - 16
</em><br>
<em>&gt;year who has stroke (not secondary to cocaine). Is there personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;responsibility in having a stroke? Would the provision of help to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stroke patients &quot;create a class of people who stop striving to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better themselves&quot; ?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, wasn't trying to duck the question.
<br>
<p>Okay, he's 16, which means he should be covered by his parents
<br>
insurance, unless he has no parents in which case he's a ward of
<br>
the state. Those provisions would apply.
<br>
<p>The question is always who's going to pay, I'm of the mind that
<br>
individual adults are responsible for themselves and their
<br>
children.
<br>
<p>There should be limited means for special cases, and there are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I do care about people and as I stated here in the U.S there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;provisions, but I do not support an enlarging of these provisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;when every piece of evidence we have says it will be to the long
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;term detriment of all involved.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;#### Very good. Could you perhaps elaborate - give examples of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;situations where you would feel morally obliged to render help?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(some real life stories, persons, ages, especially those that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;describe the limits of your charity). Also, what &quot;provisions&quot; do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you mean specifically?
</em><br>
<p>Quite the trap you've set. ;)
<br>
<p>My favorite biblical story was always the good Samaritan.
<br>
<p>I've rendered first aid at numerous accidents, interfered in a few
<br>
crimes, and have been known to make considerable contributions to
<br>
charity. I'm a regular donor of platelets to the American Red Cross
<br>
(18 times 2 units each last year, 8 this year plus this Sat) and a
<br>
member of the national bone marrow registry. In short, I've never
<br>
walked away from anyone who needed my aid with the exception of a
<br>
few bums pretending to be homeless. (there is a difference).
<br>
<p>Probably my only limits are those of ability.
<br>
<p>I guess by provisions I mean I don't support the idea of a
<br>
government run universal health care system. I had a taste of that
<br>
when I was in the military, and didn't like it a bit.
<br>
<p>I'm convinced most people who do support the idea are convinced
<br>
that everything will remain the same only everyone will be covered.
<br>
I know that won't be the case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;By the way, I am also strongly opposed to a balloning welfare and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wealth-transfer system. Any transfer that is supposed to give a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;decent&quot; life (free cable, food stamps, rent) is wrong - because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the state threatens to kill the taxpayer for the sake of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;persons' amenities, trifles, little wishes. Only that help which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is absolutely and unavoidably necessary to prevent innnocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people from dying or physically suffering (like having a cancer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;melting your bones), is IMHO acceptable.
</em><br>
<p>Well, there are public hospitals for this, like Chicago's Cook
<br>
County. My best friend worked in their emergency room for four
<br>
years and he can tell you they're the people who complain the
<br>
loudest/most often. 
<br>
<p>I just happen to know people with two homes, three cars, two of
<br>
them SUV's who go on big vacations every year, and complain that
<br>
they can't &quot;afford&quot; health insurance.
<br>
<p>Some people need help getting their priorities straight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;(I am being sarcastic here)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Obviously we part company on this note.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;### Sorry. I like to go off on rhetorical flights of fancy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sometimes. Not trying to be mean on purpose.
</em><br>
<p>Nevermind, as the old saying goes &quot;When strangers meet, allowances
<br>
need to be made&quot;. ;)
