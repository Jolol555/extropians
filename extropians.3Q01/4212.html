<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Well, since you seem to think it's okay to keep discussing it, I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(see what happens when you insist on having the last word?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Dr. Emerson, who is the plaintiff in US v. Emerson did not do what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;claim he did. His separated wife, months after he caught her and her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;boyfriend in bed together and allegedly threatened them (which is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;created their divorce proceedings), saw fit to perform some sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;sitdown strike in his office: she wouldn't leave his place of business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and was interfering with his patients. He ordered her to leave, and when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;she wouldn't, he called the police and pulled a gun on her to restrain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;her until the police arrived. His daughter was never around.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Furthermore, her claims about his 'threats' remained unsubstantiated and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;were never examined in court, he was never afforded his due process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rights, when the judge unilaterally issued a restraining order.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Dr. Emerson has never been charged with domestic abuse of any sort, does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;not have a criminal record, while his wife has a record of mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;instability. Once again, Joe, you are caught in another one of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;conflations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me get this straight Mike; when she REFUSED to leave, this guy pulled a gun on her to KEEP her from leaving?   And you say he has no mental problems?  
</em><br>
<p>He was arresting her.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Maybe not diagnosed so far, but the blatant illogic of that move should remedy that in short order.  Why didn't he just call the cops to remove her?  Answer: because he's obviously not the brightest, or most rational, banana in the hand.  And as to the r
</em><br>
estraining order; a judge issued it, and when a person is under a restraining order or a peace bond, they should relinquish their weapons until the order is lifted; the #1 killer of married women is not armed, but their armed and abusive husbands. 
<br>
<p>The judge issued the restraining order with no due process. It is a
<br>
'prior restraint' violation of one's constitutional rights when you
<br>
issue an order that violates a persons rights without due process.
<br>
Emerson was never arrested prior to the order, was never charged or
<br>
arraigned, nor was he eve notified of the hearing during which the order
<br>
was issued.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People who are issued those orders by judges do not get to decide whether or not to obey them, any more than any other person a court rules upon, regardless of what certain organizations and people think.  Considering his actions in drawing a weapon to 
</em><br>
keep a soon-to-be-ex-wife, who was refusing to leave his office, from leaving,it looks like a damned good judicial judgment to me.
<br>
<p>Only because you are ignorant of the law.
