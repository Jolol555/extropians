<p>Biotech execs: Criminalizing cloning may spur scientific brain drain
<br>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Cloning and embryonic stem cell research in the United
<br>
States is plodding along while lawmakers wrestle with the legality of the
<br>
science, but overseas, researchers are blazing ahead.
<br>
<p>Israeli scientists, for instance, announced Wednesday that they have
<br>
succeeded for the first time in growing heart cells from human embryonic
<br>
stem cells, a day after the U.S. House of Representatives voted to ban human
<br>
cloning in any form.
<br>
<p>And at least two other biotech companies, Geron Corp. of Menlo Park, Calif.
<br>
and Biotransplant Inc. of Charlestown, Mass. are hedging their bets by
<br>
investing in cloning companies outside the United States.
<br>
<p>All this has some biotechnology executives predicting that the United States
<br>
can expect a scientific exodus if Congress succeeds in criminalizing
<br>
so-called human cloning for medical purposes.
<br>
<p>``If this is outlawed in the United States, we will see our best scientific
<br>
minds moving overseas,'' said Tom Tureen, an Advanced Cell director.
<br>
Advanced Cell is the only U.S. company that has gone public with plans to
<br>
clone eggs to make human embryos for use in a variety of therapies.
<br>
<p>Tureen spoke a day after the House of Representatives voted to make all
<br>
human cloning illegal, even for medical purposes, and punishable by up to $1
<br>
million in fines and 10 years in prison. A companion bill awaits action in
<br>
the Senate, where Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said he's
<br>
``opposed to the effort to clone under virtually any circumstances.''
<br>
<p>Advanced Cell, based in Worcester, Mass., plans to create and grow embryos
<br>
without sperm, using the same cloning technology that created Dolly the
<br>
sheep.
<br>
<p>Geron, the commercial leader in embryonic stem cell research, bought the
<br>
company that cloned Dolly, Scotland's Roslin Bio-Med, in 1999.
<br>
Biotransplant, meanwhile, invested in the Australian company Stem Cells
<br>
Sciences, which is doing what the U.S. company Advanced Cell Technology only
<br>
hopes to do: clone embryos for their stem cells.
<br>
<p>In cloning, scientists remove the nucleus from an egg and replace it with
<br>
the nucleus from an adult cell, which contains the DNA of the donor. The egg
<br>
is allowed to develop into an embryo. For reproduction, the embryo would be
<br>
placed in a woman's womb and carried until birth. For developing medical
<br>
treatments, stem cells would be removed, which kills the embryo.
<br>
<p>The cloning process involves taking stem cells from four-day-old embryos.
<br>
Researchers say these stem cells can be grown into cells capable of
<br>
repairing the heart, liver, brain and other vital organs.
<br>
<p>Advanced Cell and other companies working in the area believe therapeutic
<br>
cloning is key to the success of the medicine of the future, which they say
<br>
will revolutionize medical care -- and promote longevity of those who can
<br>
afford it -- by regenerating sick tissue.
<br>
<p>Because the cells used in treatment originate from the genetic material of
<br>
the patient being treated, proponents say therapeutic cloning is the best
<br>
way to avoid immune rejection, considered the biggest obstacle to making
<br>
regenerative medicine workable. Proponents contend that cloning is the best
<br>
way to avoid immune rejection.
<br>
<p>Although Advanced Cell has yet to clone a human embryo, it is working hard
<br>
to do so and has already collected eggs from paid donors.
<br>
<p>``This work will probably go to England,'' where therapeutic cloning is
<br>
legal, Tureen said.
<br>
<p>One leading stem cell expert, Roger Pedersen of the University of California
<br>
at San Francisco, has already left the United States for a post at Cambridge
<br>
University in Britain, and UCSF is considering shutting down its research
<br>
lab as a result.
<br>
<p>Pedersen cited the difficult U.S. political climate as among his reasons for
<br>
leaving.
<br>
<p>Biotransplant CEO Elliot Lebowitz said that the United States' loss could be
<br>
his company's gain, given his Australian connections.
<br>
<p>``Because of our relationship with Stem Cell Sciences our position will be
<br>
enhanced,'' Lebowitz said. ``The world outside the U.S. does represent a
<br>
large market as big as the one here.''
