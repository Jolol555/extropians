<em>&gt; Robert has taken a lot of grief for this post including being charged with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the worst crime: engaging in &quot;pro-entropy&quot; (Anders) activities. With some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reluctance I feel compelled to defend the logic of what Robert is saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I think he raises an important question, namely: what are we willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to sacrifice now in terms of lives to advance the effects of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity?
</em><br>
<p>You can be willing to sacrifice your OWN life.  You don't get to decide
<br>
whether to sacrifice SOMEONE ELSE'S life.
<br>
<p>There are known exceptions to this rule.  I talked about one of them when
<br>
I said that I would, in theory, back a ground war in Afghanistan and Iraq
<br>
to remove their governments from power.  (I can't back the current war, in
<br>
practice, because I expect our government to mess it up and do something
<br>
worse than useless, like &quot;retaliatory air strikes&quot;.)  But that isn't the
<br>
logic of Tit for Tat or even saving the maximum number of equally valued
<br>
lives; it's based on my belief that Earth's survival will be directly
<br>
threatened by the existence of terrorist groups, and that the transition
<br>
from &quot;a world with state-sponsored terrorism&quot; to &quot;a world with no
<br>
state-sponsored terrorism and slightly weaker terrorists&quot; is thus worth
<br>
fighting for even if a large number of casualties are involved.  And this
<br>
holds whether the casualties are American civilians or Afghani civilians.
<br>
<p>Tyrannical governments cannot be allowed to hide behind civilian shields;
<br>
it would give them infinite license and more people would be hurt in the
<br>
long run.  If the US government were to go the way of Nazi Germany, then I
<br>
would understand the absolute necessity for foreign governments to attack
<br>
the US even at the cost of civilian lives, even including my own.  (And if
<br>
I didn't agree with the need, they would have to attack anyway.)  In an
<br>
entangled world it is possible for moral principles to directly conflict,
<br>
and so we cannot be morally comfortable this side of the Singularity, but
<br>
it's important to remember that all such conflicts are still bugs in the
<br>
Universe, and must be minimized rather than embraced.
