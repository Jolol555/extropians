</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; as that occurs.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; A trivial problem that can be solved very cheaply of course as I pointed out more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once, but you don't want it solved, star wars wouldn't work then,  that's why you don't put
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; might do things differently, unlike you he just might want to do things that make it hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for star wars not easy.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, engineer, enlighten us with your wisdom. Any enemy may TRY to make
<br>
things hard for NMD, however, any attempt will detract from the warhead
<br>
carrying capability of the missile as well as be less than effective
<br>
unless the 'decoy' is of similar mass and shape as an IRV, in which case
<br>
you might as well put a warhead in your 'decoy'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; the ephemerides of a heavy warhead versus a light decoy will show
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; themselves by midcourse. [...] mass differences will show the greatest effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; at the apogee point in the trajectory, long before it hits air.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps in some parallel universe things work that way but not in this one,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as any high school physics student would tell you, if not an eighth grade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science class.
</em><br>
<p>a) the ionosphere and near earth space are not pure vacuums, contrary to
<br>
the hopes of the anti-NMDers, so there will, in fact, be drag of a very
<br>
minor amount throughout the trajectory of the decoys and warheads. The
<br>
blunt face of a spherical balloon will create greater IR signature than
<br>
the conical shape of the warhead. This is a rather minor amount, but not
<br>
beyond the possibility of detection by current IR technology.
<br>
<p>b) the system that releases the decoys and thrusts them away from the
<br>
bus will have to be different than that of the IRVs, and as such will
<br>
never be able to exactly replicate the same delta-v of the IRV system,
<br>
so decoys and IRV will always follow different orbits.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;A Missile doesn't follow a circular orbit, it  is elliptical [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Planets and most satellites are in elliptical orbits, missiles aren't in orbit at all and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their trajectory is not elliptical, it's parabolic.
</em><br>
<p>Any trajectory is an orbit about a common center of gravity. That the
<br>
mass of the other object gets in the way at some point is really
<br>
irrelevant to that fact. Yes, I forgot about the conic section rule on
<br>
the shape of orbits, sue me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; Again: What is the point of using decoys?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again: They weigh almost nothing, they take up almost no room in the rocket,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they move just like the real warhead in a vacuum and are as cheap as toy balloons.
</em><br>
<p>Decoys that are not of sufficiently similar mass as an actual warhead
<br>
are not useful as decoys. Between radar and IR signatures, any decoy
<br>
which is not of similar mass and shape as an actual warhead is
<br>
detectable, therefore the only proper decoy is an actual IRV. If you are
<br>
going to take up that much space on the bus, you might as well fill it
<br>
with an actual warhead.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;you need to remove a  real warhead to put in one or more decoys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right, I'm sure it would never occur to an enemy to wait until the rocket was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in space to inflate the decoy balloons, the decoys would be at full size even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the rocket sat on the launch pad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I will concede the a perfect ICBM defense is possible provided the enemy is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a gang of imbeciles.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure from this snide comment that you have no actual experience with
<br>
ICBM or missiles of any kind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; This was dealing with John's inane notion of having all IRV be spherical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BALLOONS!! I NEVER SAID ONE WORD ABOUT A SPHERICAL REENTRY WARHEAD!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not one fucking word.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, you did, as a retort about the radar signature issue.
