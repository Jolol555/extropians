<p><p>Hmmm... some hypothetical figures:
<br>
<p>If the group that professed to going &quot;frequently&quot; numbered 4,800 of the 
<br>
5,000 people in the survey and 75 of them died during the survey, while 
<br>
just 2 people in the other group died then you could say that regular 
<br>
church-goers were statistically &quot;23 percent less likely to die&quot;.
<br>
<p>Of course &quot;frequently&quot; is not a very precise term, so if we choose a better 
<br>
one, and divide the two groups up into people who go &quot;once in a blue moon&quot; 
<br>
and those who go more often than that then the results almost certainly 
<br>
would have been different as one of those 2 people who died in the 
<br>
infrequent church-goers' group would probably have been in the 
<br>
more-often-than-once-in-a-blue-moon attendees and suddenly people who 
<br>
rarely attended church would have been almost 50% less likely to die.  :-)
<br>
<p>It really is a bit like saying that most people have more than the average 
<br>
number of legs... except that we have some kind of knowledge of the numbers 
<br>
there. We have no idea of the numbers in the religious statistics, though 
<br>
we do know something of their agenda.
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
