<p><em>&gt; I'll simply point out that there appears to be a contradiction

</em><br>
<em>&gt; disobedience of Dr. King and the Founding Fathers but yet on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other hand he seems to be critical of corporate interests promoting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;disobedience&quot; of individuals like &quot;Ice-T&quot;.  There is a hint
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one must disobey &quot;Peacably, yes. Respectfully, of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nonviolently, absolutely.&quot; yet in the final analysis Heston seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly in favor of violence where justified to revolt against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the oppressors.
</em><br>
<p>If we first, charitably, assume that there is no contradition, then
<br>
we may infer the guiding principle.  Charlton Heston celebrates, as
<br>
you say, individuals with the qualities of Dr. King and John Adams,
<br>
Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington,.   He then
<br>
deprecates the morals, motives, views., of people like &quot;Ice-T&quot;.  The
<br>
reason that this doesn't seem contradictory to me is that I too wish
<br>
to vigorously spread memes denouncing views harmful to creating
<br>
wealth and to forming strong and moral societies (i.e., those I agree
<br>
with).  Heston is quite religious, and, ironically operates on the
<br>
same view that I do, only in his case it is also God's view of the
<br>
situation.
<br>
<p>I'm still a moral relativist (like Russell Blackford) and haven't
<br>
yet been persuaded to the contrary by Mike Lorrey; I'll go over
<br>
to that thread and ask, &quot;Why can't I admit that the universe consists
<br>
of only atoms in motion &amp; there are no absolute morals, yet also join
<br>
those who strongly revile murder, theft, genocide, adultery, sloth,.?&quot;
