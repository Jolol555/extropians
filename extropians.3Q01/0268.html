</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; readers of my stuff will know, is the creation and support of guilds:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; licensing is a rent-seeking mechanism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This licensing does fit into a libertarian scheme as well, where one

</em><br>
<p>Actually, no.  Licensing is different from certification.  Licenses, in this
<br>
context, means obtaining a permission to do something from some government
<br>
agency, such as a license to build weapons for sale, to drive vehicles, or
<br>
to sell plumbing services.  Anything less is really not the kind of
<br>
licensing most people mean when they say someone is a licensed something or
<br>
other.
<br>
<p>The differences between government licensing and private nongovernment
<br>
certification, especially when the latter bears no legal priviliges or
<br>
restrictions, are very important.  E.g., different private groups can have
<br>
different standards.  More importantly, such standards might change with
<br>
regard to the market and the reputation of the standards groups depends on
<br>
the quality of their ability to rate.  Thus, they have an interest in
<br>
meeting their customer's demands.  Government licensing bodies, including
<br>
private ones that have government sanction, such as the AMA boards, do not
<br>
have this incentive and, in general, are more focused on not what the market
<br>
demands in terms of ratings, quality, and skill, but extraneous factors.
<br>
(That's why the AMA went hog wild over chiropractry and really does very
<br>
little about disciplining its own members.  It's interest, given its
<br>
[legally sanctioned] monopoly is not to punish its members, but to maintain
<br>
and increase its power.  I believe JLS covered the origins of the AMA in the
<br>
1980s.  It's archive is online at <a href="http://www.mises.org/jlsdisplay.asp">http://www.mises.org/jlsdisplay.asp</a>? for
<br>
those have the time to do a search.)
<br>
<p>(On the economic effects of occupational licensing, see _The Rule of
<br>
Experts: Occupational Licensing in America_ by S. David Young.)
<br>
<p>Surely, an insurer or other party might want for someone doing these
<br>
activities to be qualified by some third party, but in a libertarian
<br>
society, it would be possible for someone to try these activities without
<br>
licensing or certification.  No one might be willing to fund that person --
<br>
e.g., no one might want to buy a weapon from a guy who just slaps them
<br>
together willy nilly or from the self taught plumber, but that's another
<br>
matter.  That person could still try to get customers.
<br>
<p>As for the constitutional arguments, these have nothing to do per se with
<br>
libertarian politics.  The U.S. Constitution and various State constitutions
<br>
in the U.S. are not libertarian.  While it might be helpful to know these
<br>
documents, they should not be treated as sacred and immutable.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
