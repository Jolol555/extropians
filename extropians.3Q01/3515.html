<em>&gt; &gt; absentee ballots
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; these votes should have been excluded.  By law, these votes

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a) the 'corrections' were not in the way the voters voted, but in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the ballots were supposed to be printed with their voter ID numbers on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them already. Most voters voting in absentia have no means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; determining their voter ID numbers, it is the responsibility of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; state to provide them. To penalize the voters for the actions of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; state is an illegal disenfranchisement, as the courts ruled.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; b) the ballots were never outside the election system. The GOP provided
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; staff to write in the voter ID numbers on government premises.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; c) Votes were NEVER altered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree, with a couple of clarifications.  They did not change the votes (as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far as we know), but it was still illegal.  The votes were cast and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given to the Republican party which then later resubmitted them to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counted.  They were originally rejected as invalid and then after being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changed, were accepted.  This is illegal.  Votes, even outer envelopes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be changed after a voter submits it.  Votes also cannot leave the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control of the election system, go to one political party, and then be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recast.
</em><br>
<p>As I said, this is NOT what happened. NO VOTES CHANGED. Get it yet?
<br>
Nobody's ballots changed who they were voting for, so therefore no votes
<br>
changed. Nor did any ballots leave the control of the election system.
<br>
All work done to add the proper voter ID numbers to ballots was done on
<br>
premises.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also not that they only did this with Republican votes, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Democratic votes.  The reason is that the voting materials were provided by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Republican Party which left of the voter ID numbers.  Had they been the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real ballots printed by the State of Florida, they would have been valid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The State did not screw these ballots up, the Republican Party did.  I agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the votes were probably not altered because they were Republican voters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only and presumably voted for Bush.
</em><br>
<p>This is incorrect. Both GOP and Democrat registered ballots were printed
<br>
without voter ID numbers, and they were 'real ballots'. Moreover, the
<br>
Democrats did correct some democrat votes, but gave up and decided to
<br>
instead insist all ballots without ID numbers be rejected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The Republicans also fought &quot;for&quot; recounts in some counties where they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; thought they would improve, like Volusia county, and &quot;against&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recounts in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; other counties where they thought they would win.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, but in no instance did they insist on ballot counting rules that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deviated from those in place on election day, as I said before and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ignored.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes they did.  They argued that the State Law called for a recount on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day of the election, but that Harris was not bound to use these recounts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later.  They reverted back to the original counts for some counties where it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefited Bush.  Although state law required the recount on the day of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; election, they changed the requirement for the recount later.
</em><br>
<p>If a recount does not change the result of an election, then whether the
<br>
winner wins by 1 million or just 1,000 ballots is irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, somewhere between 4-6 million ballots were thrown out, including a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; couple hundred thousand alone in the Illinois County that is home to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Gore's campaign chairman, old 'Two Vote' Daley.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You must not be aware that many of the Republican ballots that were fixed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; duplicated votes.  When the ballots were thought to be invalid, many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; republicans went to the polls and voted in person.  These voters got to vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twice.  When they accepted the fixed ballots later, there were computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems with the Republican party records of the fixed votes, such that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they couldn't verify that Republican votes didn't count twice.  Rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throw out some valid votes, they won a court case to allow all the votes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including duplicate Republican votes, to count in the system.
</em><br>
<p>This is not correct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The spoilsport antics of the rent-a-riot left wing at the inauguration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and since have continued to help Bush by casting the left as too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immature to lead, and too shrilly extremist to represent the people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This is too funny.  The Republicans did the same thing in Miami
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; flew in paid participants for their riot.  Both sides do the exact same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; thing, and yet most people only recall the poor behavior on one side.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Show me footage of a republican 'riot'. Only one instance did they stage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a peaceful protest, outside the Dade recount places, where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; republicans in the room noticed no disturbances. The democrats claimed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it was a 'riot' only because they didn't like the fact that someone was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; demonstrating 'against' them, which was 'obviously' staged by 'racist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bigoted, sexist, right-wing wackos'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike, you can nitpick words all you want.  The Miami county officials tried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to move the ballot boxes through the hallway with all the yelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protestors.  They could not get through.  They crowd was not outside, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were physically blocking the hallway where the ballots were being carried.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They refused to allow the officials through.  After repeated requests to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow them through, the officials gave up and said that they could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finish the recount because the yelling crowd of paid republican
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrators were physically blocking their access to the recount room.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This may not have been a riot, but it was a physical disruption of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; election process by paid members of Republican congressional staffers who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were flown down specifically for this purpose.  Nitpicking on whether it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a riot or not misses the point.  They paid protestors and flew them in to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disrupt a legal process, and it worked.  You can't blame Democrats for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paying protestors and claim that Republicans don't do the same thing.
</em><br>
<p>If the Democrats paid for the protesters BEFORE the election started,
<br>
indicating they were planning on trying to steal the election by riot
<br>
before it even happened, then any counter-action to set things to right
<br>
is perfectly justified. Who initiated the violence? It was the
<br>
Democrats. Its who initiates it that counts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is one more instance of a liberal claiming a crime occurs only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because they 'felt intimidated', not that any actually intimidating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; behavior actually occurred. Much like blacks protesting police checking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for outstanding warrants on the election day. Since felons can't vote,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; its obvious that only those who are felons should be worried about their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ability to commit vote fraud being impaired.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem wasn't that felons were kept from voting.  The problem was that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many non-felon blacks were mistakenly marked as felons and kept from voting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This was done by a Texas right-wing group that worked for Jeb Bush who came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in and volunteered to mark black felons in the computer systems.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; screwed up and blocked all blacks with any police record, not just felony
</em><br>
<em>&gt; records.  Many blacks, including state legislators(!) were denied their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to vote because they were marked as felons.  This is a valid complaint
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for them to make.  It is not just that they felt intimidated.
</em><br>
<p>I've heard nothing about this. All I've heard is that some felons who
<br>
had had their felonies expunged or gotten petitions of relief from civil
<br>
disability granted wound up being wiped from the rolls when they should
<br>
not have, which included one felon who sat on an election board.
