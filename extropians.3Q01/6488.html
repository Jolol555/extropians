</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed. I never meant to imply otherwise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And, for what it's worth, my point about vigilantes is that they're _not_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally painted as suicidal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Making stupid Weltpolitik moves is.
</em><br>
<p>Depends on which moves you are talking about. Sure the countries which
<br>
have assisted, sheltered, and funded these groups (an any other
<br>
terrorist group) as a part of what they considered to be a normal part
<br>
of their foreign policy.
<br>
<p>The problem here is defining terrorism. A terrorist does not wear a
<br>
uniform, does not belong to an organized army, and does not declare
<br>
his/her intentions ahead of time, i.e. the terrorist does not behave
<br>
according to the accepted Laws of War. Furthermore, a society which
<br>
aids, abets, shelters, supports, funds, or makes excuses for a terrorist
<br>
or terrorist organization, which allows terrorists to hide within their
<br>
ranks as a civilian, is acting as a shield in a very militay manner. By
<br>
these acts, the society that shelters the terrorist is declaring that
<br>
the military uniform of their nation is civilian garb, and thus
<br>
civilians are legitimate targets.
<br>
<p>Until now, no nation has properly impressed terrorist societies as to
<br>
the consequences of such actions. The KGB made a good jab at this in the
<br>
early 1980's, when the Islamic Jihad/Hezbollah attempted to take Soviets
<br>
as hostages in Lebanon. The KGB kidnapped relatives of the hostage
<br>
takers, and mailed their testicles to the terrorists. The soviet
<br>
hostages were released almost overnight.
<br>
<p>People around the world need to be impressed as to why we have laws in
<br>
warfare, specifically to prevent the deaths of innocent civilians. This
<br>
is ostensibly a western ethic, generally derived from the european
<br>
tradition of chivalry that only warriors fought warriors. The civilian
<br>
society's productive output may fund their military, but they as
<br>
individuals didn't send anyone off to war. So long as all sides behaved
<br>
in this manner, it was fine. Germany of course, in WWII, as well as the
<br>
Japanese, seriously damaged this tradition, fully expecting to be
<br>
victorious enough to rewrite the rules.
<br>
<p>This is also why in the US it has been our tradition to keep no active
<br>
commando special forces organizations active during peacetime, and why
<br>
intelligence capabilities have generally been relegated to data
<br>
collection and analysis. The Cold War changed all this, with US society
<br>
maintaining the appearance of a peacetime economy while engaged in a
<br>
protracted conflict with the Soviet bloc. Since 1990, primarily due to
<br>
the threat of terrorism, we have failed to return our covert military
<br>
capabilities to peacetime deactivated levels.
<br>
<p>By all accounts, it seems that if we are not to fade from history back
<br>
into isolationism, leaving the rest of the world to dissolve in its own
<br>
hates to the point of nuclear inferno, then we are going to be embracing
<br>
the inevitable mantle of empire, and all of the responsibilities that
<br>
come with it. We will be repressing violent groups to a far greater
<br>
extent, as well as those societies which refuse to behave in a civilized
<br>
manner.
<br>
<p>This period will be like that when Rome sought to clear the
<br>
Mediterranean of pirates, which eventually led to the Punic Wars. In our
<br>
case, we have Russia (Ancient Greece) to ally with, and an upstart China
<br>
which is supplying ballistic missiles and other armaments to countries
<br>
which sponsor terrorism. China claims that they support our right to
<br>
retaliate here, but Chinese chat rooms are full of people celebrating
<br>
the attacks on New York and the Pentagon. The Chinese government insists
<br>
on being consulted before any attacks, though, which leads one to wonder
<br>
what intelligence they are supplying to the terrorist states (as they
<br>
did to Serbia in the Balkan War, which is the real reason their embassy
<br>
was hit). China may choose, it seems, to take on the position of
<br>
Carthage, a nation of people which feeds their first born children into
<br>
the furnace of Moloch (strangely similar to the state mandated abortion
<br>
of second children), in which you are either a Master (Party Member) or
<br>
a Slave (common person).
