<p>This is too simplistic.  If the &quot;common man&quot; can buy the house
<br>
from Mexico or those who are poor can buy it then many will want
<br>
and strive for the more expensive house in order to distinquish
<br>
themselves.    Similarly, if there was guaranteed income at a
<br>
certain level many would work for more to distinquish themselves
<br>
from others or would become more creative in part for the very
<br>
same reason.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You would lose that bet. They were not put there by the man
<br>
necessarily but they sure didn't chose to be there nor are only
<br>
their own choices responsible for them ending up there.  This
<br>
economy does in fact have quite exploitive elements in it.  For
<br>
instance, the way it attempts to consume the savings and energy
<br>
of its middle-class in mindless consumerism to the point where
<br>
the debt to earnings ratio of many middle-class people is
<br>
grossly out of balance.  A relatively small downturn in the
<br>
market or a bit of illness or other personal misfortune drives
<br>
many from relative comfort to homelessness or very near to it. 
<br>
I speak from experience of both being homeless in my early
<br>
twenties and from being nearly so from a position of being a
<br>
very highly regarded software engineer when I went through a
<br>
rough perioud in my life 8-9 years back and again 5 years back.  
<br>
<p>Despite all the brave words, attitude and judgementalness it is
<br>
much easier to fall through the cracks in this &quot;land of plenty&quot;
<br>
than most people want to acknowledge.
