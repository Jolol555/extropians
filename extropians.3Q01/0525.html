Tossed from the fog where onlookers lurk...
<br>
<p>&quot;This is no joke&quot; declared Mayor Keith Holliday after a city council
<br>
meeting
<br>
in Greensboro, North Carolina had ended in chaos. &quot;I was just trying to
<br>
think outside the box. And if cryogenic freezing was good enough for
<br>
Walt
<br>
Disney, then it's certainly good enough for some bunch of murderers on
<br>
death
<br>
row.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mayor Holliday had proposed his radical solution during a council debate
<br>
about the problems of overcrowding in the city's penitentiary. &quot;At
<br>
present
<br>
Death row inmates can appeal against execution for year after year,
<br>
claiming
<br>
wrongful conviction and judicial irregularities. That delay causes
<br>
overcrowding, and costs us millions in legal fees and prison fees,
<br>
before we
<br>
can finally execute them. So instead of wasting all that money, why
<br>
don't we
<br>
put them all on ice? We could cryogenically freeze them, then reverse
<br>
the
<br>
process if later evidence clears them of their crimes. If it doesn't
<br>
then
<br>
they just stay frozen. I watched a television talk show about it last
<br>
night,
<br>
and we have the technology. All we need now is Jesus the Lord, fine corn
<br>
liquor, and the courage to think the unthinkable.&quot;
<br>
<p>This was sourced in The Roanoke Times, dated the 7th October 2000, and
<br>
reprinted in Private Eye, a British periodical.
