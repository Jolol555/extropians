</em><br>
<p>I must have.  The World Trade Center would be an act of war if committed
<br>
by any foreign organization, and if the game rules are to be amended to
<br>
allow war between non-governmental organizations, it was an act of war
<br>
when committed by bin Laden.  But it is not comparable to the kind of
<br>
casualties that would be inflicted by a real war.  It is not comparable to
<br>
what Iraqi civilians went through during Desert Storm.  Note that I
<br>
*agree* that what Iraqi civilians went through was an acceptable price to
<br>
pay to establish that the world will not permit wars of conquest.  My
<br>
point is that the United States has not suffered a tenth, even a
<br>
thousandth, of the pain we would undergo if we were attacked by an equal
<br>
or greater enemy.
<br>
<p>What I don't like is the assumption that Iraqi or Afghan civilian
<br>
casualties are acceptable - undesirable, perhaps, but acceptable - while
<br>
American civilian casualties are unimaginable horrors.
<br>
<p>I am not a pacifist.  I'd like to be someday, but I don't believe that
<br>
pacifism is morally defensible while my civil liberties only exist because
<br>
police officers and military soldiers are willing to kill - not die, kill
<br>
- to defend them.  If Afghanistan is breeding terrorists, then I think
<br>
it's acceptable to go in with a ground war and remove the Taliban from
<br>
power, even if civilians and involuntary draftees are killed.  Not so much
<br>
because of the World Trade Center, but to delay the day when terrorists
<br>
acquire and use weapons of mass destruction.  I don't think I could agree
<br>
with a retaliatory air strike unless it's followed by a ground war to
<br>
permanently remove the offending government from power.  Rogue states are
<br>
destabilizing forces in the years leading up to the Singularity.  Removing
<br>
them from existence and discouraging other states from going rogue is a
<br>
worthwhile endeavor.  It's pointless to hurt the civilians of the country
<br>
whose government supported the terrorists that hurt our civilians.
<br>
<p>If the upshot of the WTC attack is that the Iraqi and/or Afghani
<br>
governments are removed from power by military force, that really would
<br>
have an impact on history.  It would establish international law, like the
<br>
original Desert Storm.
<br>
<p>But if I think that 100,000 civilian Afghan casualties are an acceptable
<br>
price to pay to prevent the nuclear bombing of New York and Chicago, then
<br>
I must believe 100,000 civilian American casualties are an acceptable
<br>
price as well.
