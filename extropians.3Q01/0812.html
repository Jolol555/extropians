<em>&gt;Of the notes I have read on this issue, I think people here are really

</em><br>
<em>&gt;their place in existence, a value system, and a community. Religious 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;belief is only one expression of this phenomena.
</em><br>
<p>This is one possible explanation. But it must be remembered that it is only 
<br>
a theory. Until somebody comes up with hard facts even my rather silly 
<br>
explanation of fiddling the numbers could be correct.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Three other examples approached from different angles support this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contention. First, women's life expectancy in developed western nations is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;longer than men's. That is because women are more capable of developing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deeper, more satisfying emotional relationships.
</em><br>
<p>Another explanation could be as simple as women's metabolism running 
<br>
slightly slower than men's. I am sure I could come up with more...
<br>
<p>Women cook and so are more likely to eat balanced diets.
<br>
<p>Women have a culture of listening to their bodies, unlike men who often 
<br>
don't seem to recognise problems before they become dangerous. (I've 
<br>
recently read a piece from a doctor pleading that men become more conscious 
<br>
of their bodies.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;...the never been married single man has the lowest life expectancy. This 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fact has also been demonstrated in many survival situations. One example 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being the Donner party, being trapped by winter snows in the Sierra 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Nevada, the unattached single men were the first to die.
</em><br>
<p>Young men have hardly any subcutaneous fat. In snow-bound conditions this 
<br>
can be a fatal trait. They also tend to be more reckless. They certainly 
<br>
have more car accidents than any other part of society.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Lastly, in the Nazi concentration camps those who were best able to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;psychologically survive the experience were those who held a strong belief 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system giving them the tools to deal with the situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;. This included, Catholics, Jews, communists, etc.
</em><br>
<p>I can't think of another explanation, and feel you may have the correct 
<br>
interpretation here, but just because it sounds right doesn't mean it is. 
<br>
It still may be completely wide of the truth.
<br>
<p>All your explanations may be completely correct or may be totally wrong. 
<br>
All we can do is suggest possibilities until someone goes out and does the 
<br>
experiment to prove it one way or the other.
<br>
<p>OK. Any volunteers to sign up for a nazi-style death camp? Your death would 
<br>
be in a good cause...  :-)
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
