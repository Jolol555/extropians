<p><em>&gt; Lee, iirc you claim you can gauge the IQ of a person if given a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minutes talk.  I guess a few years of online comm, even if not truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directed at each other during most of the time would seem to suffice.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I only rejoined extropians in March, and so have only seen
<br>
you in action for five months.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, what is your informal estimate of old 'gene here?
</em><br>
<p>There are several good reasons not to go into publicly discussing
<br>
someone's IQ---it's rather inappropriate and undignified for one
<br>
thing.  For another, the entire area is very controversial and
<br>
great uncertainty would attend such estimates.  For yet another,
<br>
I know that people would naturally be very sensitive about
<br>
discussing a quality which, after all, has far too much mystique
<br>
about it as it is.  At age 30, for example, I would have felt most
<br>
uncomfortable having a group of people begin to publicly argue
<br>
about what my IQ was (it doesn't matter so much anymore since I
<br>
don't care nearly so much:  I've known many, many very good judges
<br>
of such things who have very high regard for my intelligence, although
<br>
I've also known twenty or thirty very bright people in my life who
<br>
thought that I was a complete idiot--- and worse, while I can
<br>
dismiss most of those opinions for one reason or another, it does
<br>
seem like five or six of them were really onto something.  So
<br>
several more opinions about me either way just wouldn't matter.
<br>
But I'd guess your age to be even closer to 30 than mine is to
<br>
55--and so there would be a concern about your sensitivity.
<br>
<p>Still the Extropian list isn't for the faint-hearted, and also I
<br>
hardly want to back down from such an interesting challenge, if
<br>
possible.  By the way, can you think of any reason that your I.Q.
<br>
would have been seven or eight points lower in May?  Anyway, I've
<br>
omitted the May data; the rest of my analysis puts your I.Q. between
<br>
153 and 155, that is, between 3.31 and 3.34 standard deviations (16
<br>
points per sd).  Note: I have not taken into account any unfamiliarity
<br>
on your part with the English language even though from your name and
<br>
your email address I assume that you're German---your command of
<br>
English is quite excellent, but you might want to add one or two
<br>
points if it does seem to you that you are less comfortable or
<br>
can't express yourself quite so clearly in English.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, if anyone else is interested in having me perform a similar
<br>
analysis based upon their (hopefully voluminous) postings, I'd be very
<br>
happy to, but I'd prefer to do it privately.  Please send me email at
<br>
lcorbin@ tsoft. com.  The price is $24.95, I accept Visa, MasterCharge,
<br>
Discover, and American Express, and I'll accept personal checks from
<br>
people on this list who I've come to know.  (Normally, I'd put in
<br>
an apology for being such a mercenary American, but I have been
<br>
informed by a very reliable source that such an observation itself is
<br>
heavily loaded with ideology---in a way quite invisible to Americans,
<br>
it turns out, unless they are able to read Noam Chomsky---and I probably
<br>
should avoid further controversy about it until I've made some progress
<br>
in finding out what's up with that.)
