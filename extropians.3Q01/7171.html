From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Extropian%20Principles&In-Reply-To=&lt;008a01c141fe$8e57c560$055d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; Well, the self-direction part is rather variable. The main problem might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be simply that many societies are so consensus-driven that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-direction becomes hard.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, that's it. When democracy votes against evolutionary phase transition,
<br>
it's time for extropians to conduct the singularity by other means.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To put it bluntly, the attacks were a minuscule blip in the big picture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a way this is terribly sad - that human lives can be so irrelevant -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and also comforting - life goes on. The attacks will have long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences, but they hardly look like they can stop perpetual progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (unless we all laze back and let them).
</em><br>
<p>Or unless the attacks inititiate a backlash of police state tactics which
<br>
include the (forced) relinquishment of scientific progress.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Practical optimism is not something you lose faith in - it is something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you do. A merely optimistic person might lose faith in his optimism, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you know your and others happiness is something *you* create, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even the greatest disasters become merely unwanted challenges.
</em><br>
<p>That's very true, and happiness generally results from what you do, rather
<br>
than from pursuing it as an end in itself. So it really doesn't make sense to
<br>
pursue happiness itself, because happiness comes as a consequence of other
<br>
pursuits (regardless of what the US &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot; says).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a general rule, trade is an excellent way of spreading/creating not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just wealth, but also ideas and peace. When you trade with someone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting into a fight with him is against your self interest, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more nations and groups trade and communicate with each other the less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely they are to get into war with each other. Also, this trade allows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas to sneak through old cultural barriers, making people question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unworkable traditions and prejudices. Help set up a free press that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be easily stopped in the Middle East, and things will move even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster. It will still take more time than we like, but it needs to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done.
</em><br>
<p>Trade has rendered some Middle East nations wealthy, but they have used their
<br>
wealth to intensify their belligerent religious fanaticism. Were it not for
<br>
their petro-dollars, these Middle East states could not afford to buy weapons
<br>
systems. So, while in principle trade is extropic overall, there are
<br>
situations in which geographic areas can trade natural resources for the means
<br>
by which to make trouble.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
