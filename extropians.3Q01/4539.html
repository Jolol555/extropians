<em>&gt; Professor Lord Robert Winston is a major *in vitro* pioneer, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patents in transgenic technology, and the author and/or host of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SUPERHUMAN (hasn't that reached PBS yet?), so he's not necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an Olde Fogey Farte of marginal intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>:-)  I'm sure that Robert was not implying by any means that Lord W.
<br>
is of &quot;marginal intelligence&quot;.  I have talked to Eric Drexler and
<br>
I have the same impression that Robert does.  Eric is close to 4
<br>
standard deviations, I'd guess.  (That's about 1 in 30,000 statistically,
<br>
although I don't know about &quot;actually&quot;; perhaps your encyclopedia would
<br>
say again.)
<br>
<p>Have you had an opportunity to talk to Lord W. for more than just a
<br>
few minutes?  I would be very interested in your personal impressions.
<br>
While I'm sure that there are some very interesting exceptions, I
<br>
find that I can get a pretty good idea of someone's intelligence
<br>
after a ten or twenty minute discussion with them.  At least for
<br>
sure I've met some pretty dumb customers with Ph.D.'s  (I even
<br>
went to high school with some).
