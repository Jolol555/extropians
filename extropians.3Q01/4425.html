<em>&gt; And that's the nature of the &quot;game&quot; as played by the U.S., beat 'em down,

</em><br>
<p>Also, the Marshall Plan was good for business, too.  No consumers or too few
<br>
consumers with money to spend on our goods and services is bad for business.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I guess we learned a collective lesson after WW I when we supported the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea of keeping the Germans down in the dumps militarily and economically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for so many years, which bred a generation of malcontents who came back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bite us, and the far western Euros, in the ass in 1939.
</em><br>
<p>Although the governments and cultures of Germany and Japan are radically
<br>
different than before World War II, I still have this gut feeling that the
<br>
Germans and Japanese still consider themselves superior to the rest of the
<br>
world.  If we fight them in another war (and perhaps win?) should we just
<br>
occupy their countries for a much longer time?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It's best to win, but not always best to treat the downfallen as dirt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afterwards.
</em><br>
<p>Either that or the Old Testament to kill every man, woman, child, and animal
<br>
in the kingdom.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The Japanese and the Germans had one significant advantage in heavy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturing, too.  What they were left with after WW II was in ruins, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were able to rebuild with the &quot;latest&quot; technology when they had the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding, mostly in the '50s and later.  As I seem to remember from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; papers in the '70s (mostly BKK Post and such), we were still working along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with 1920s and '30s technology, for example in the steel industry, and just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't compete.  We bit the bullet, dismantled a bunch of that old stuff,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rebuilt, and got on track again, at a heavy price.
</em><br>
<p>That's right, our urban renewal paved the wave for latest technology plants.
<br>
Also, Dr. Deming provided the model for quality control up front instead of
<br>
at the end of the manufacturing process.
<br>
<p>U.S. steel production spanned the period of roughly 1870 to 1950 in forging
<br>
rails for the railroad expansion, farming implements/buildings, and the
<br>
growth of taller buildings including skyscrapers in the larger cities.  The
<br>
U.S. sidestepped steel as a vital industry by concentrating on specialty
<br>
steels and other metals for aircraft, surgical tools, and the space program.
<br>
<p>Japan kept doing business the old way in a protected market while the rest
<br>
of the world learned about quality control, improved marketing of new and
<br>
improved products/services, cheaper labor (overseas sweat shops), and more
<br>
protection from economic espionage.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; On the economic side, that's a matter of just flat hard work on their part,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a wee bit of government protectionism on their side, too.  Remember, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasn't so long ago that we, me too, looked down on anything labeled &quot;Made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Japan.&quot;  Mid '50s? Early 60s?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, hard work and close cooperation between industry and the government.
<br>
Government in the United States is anti-business even while promoting business,
<br>
a schizophrenic attitude.
<br>
<p>First, South Korea competed with Japan in Asia and now China is heading down
<br>
that same road.  I've been watching the quality control and price of VCR
<br>
rewinders made in China improve dramatically in the last few years.  Now if
<br>
they apply that to the military, &quot;anything goes.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Oh, well, I'm out of it now, time for another home brew.
</em><br>
<p>I'm half in and half out of it, time for another Coca-Cola or RC Cola.
