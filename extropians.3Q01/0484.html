<p>I got into programming as (a) a means to possibly keep track of
<br>
all my different interests and pieces of information I pick up;
<br>
(b) as a tool for changing the world; (c) as something to test
<br>
myself in the real world with.  That I also got to earn my bread
<br>
doing it was and is an incredible bonus and one that certainly
<br>
allowed me to do more of it.
<br>
<p>I pick up new skills when/as I need them or because of an itch
<br>
to find a better way of doing something or because a particular
<br>
problem interests me and I am arrogant enough of my abilities to
<br>
tackle it.
<br>
<p>Program?  The fun of it is writing your own *program*.
