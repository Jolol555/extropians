<p>
<em>&gt; The Enduring Power of Stupidity
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; There are two basic forces in the world: Intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupidity.
</em><br>
<p>I might rephrase this slightly and say there are two basic forces:
<br>
intelligence and fear. In a situation where death or bodily harm are
<br>
imminent, fear can be useful to give one the motivation and energy to fight
<br>
or flee. But people are not good at dealing with fear of abstract or future
<br>
dangers.
<br>
<p>The fear-based reactions to the 9-11 terrorist attacks are doing *far* more
<br>
harm than the attacks themselves. To take one small part of it--shutting
<br>
down the aviation industry has caused, and continues to cause, vast economic
<br>
damage. I understand that at the moment, no general aviation VFR flights are
<br>
being allow, including *crop dusters*. Given the dependence of present-day
<br>
agriculture on chemical applications, this move carries the effects of the
<br>
attack even to that industry.
<br>
<p>I've heard that people are canceling plans to travel by commercial airliner
<br>
out of fear. And yet, statistically, they're far more likely to be killed
<br>
driving to the airport than flying on the plane. Please realize that this
<br>
was true *even on the morning of 9-11*. Flying now is safer than it was
<br>
before the attacks, because the terrorist organizations now have fewer
<br>
members willing to die in suicide attacks.
<br>
<p>I don't even want to go into a discussion of the stuff I've heard and read
<br>
about wiping out several million innocent people.
<br>
<p>Humans are notoriously bad at risk assessment. They do things such as drive
<br>
five blocks to the store because they're afraid of getting mugged on the
<br>
streets, but at the same time they smoke cigarettes. One might have hoped
<br>
for a better performance from those who hold positions as the USA's leaders
<br>
and policy makers. But one has to remember that, as Charles Platt wrote,
<br>
most of the leaders are guided, at least in part, by an archaic book of
<br>
primitive myths. And, I would add, by fear.
<br>
<p>Even many of the people on this list, some of the smartest people I know,
<br>
seem to be experiencing some form of panic. Look. Consider the situation
<br>
objectively for a moment. While it's quite likely that there are at this
<br>
very moment terrorists in the US and other western countries, terrorists who
<br>
may even armed with small nuclear devices or biological weapons, I think
<br>
your odds of being taken out by one are quite small. and that you're far
<br>
more likely to die in a car crash over the coming year than from a terrorist
<br>
attack. If anyone has reason to believe otherwise, I'd be interested to see
<br>
how they've calculated the odds.
<br>
<p>You're also far more likely to be harmed by idiotic government policies than
<br>
by terrorists. Objectively assessed, the limitation on stem cell research is
<br>
far more lethal than the 9-11 terrorist attack.
<br>
<p>Charles Platt wrote: &lt;&lt; I feel a great, overwhelming melancholy. The
<br>
wonderful smart
<br>
innovations in the past decade have empowered us in so many
<br>
ways, yet we are still impotent compared with the techno-
<br>
illiterates who claim a mandate to act stupidly on our
<br>
behalf. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I felt a great melancholy when I first heard about the terrorist attack and
<br>
realized that war was inevitable. But I'm not ready to give up and hand
<br>
everything over to people who are guided by fear and archaic books of
<br>
primitive myths.
<br>
<p>I would like to ask you guys to contribute your considerable brain power to
<br>
the following pragmatic questions:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Precisely what are your goals?
<br>
How do you want to spend your lives?
<br>
&nbsp;Given the current situation where most of the world's resources are
<br>
controlled by a handful of people who act stupidly, how can you best achieve
<br>
your goals?
<br>
&nbsp;Is there any way to withdraw your support from stupid acts done supposedly
<br>
on your behalf while still pursuing your goals?
<br>
<p>I realize these are personal questions rather than general policy questions,
<br>
but I believe that general policy is best based on the welfare of the
<br>
individual person and that the best policy decisions come from considering
<br>
individual goals and determining what public policy best promotes such
<br>
goals.
<br>
<p>I'm seeking practical solutions with a substantial chance of success rather
<br>
than fanciful suggestions of space colonies, which might be a good idea at
<br>
some point but which will require some preliminary work that hasn't yet been
<br>
done. What are the preliminary stages? What can people do today or tomorrow?
