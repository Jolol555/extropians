</em><br>
<p>Shame on Ray for not giving us academic people citations to bite into.
<br>
:-(
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mass use of inventions, paradigm shift rate --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these are useful things to look at, but where are the inputs? There are no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; references. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; There hasn't been a paradigm shift in physics, for instance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since quantum physics was developed eighty years ago.
</em><br>
<p>How do you measure paradigm shifts? What about quantum field theory, the
<br>
standard model, or string/brane/whatever theory? 
<br>
<p>An objective way of measuring change in physics would be to look at when
<br>
new fundamental forces are introduced, and when they are unified. 
<br>
<p>So we have gravity and magnetism (ancient), electricity (1700's or so),
<br>
Maxwell unifying electromagnetism 1873, Chadwick &amp; Bieler introduce the
<br>
strong nuclear force 1921, Enrico Fermi introduces the weak force in
<br>
1933, Weinberg and Salam does electroweak unification in 1967 and
<br>
Fritzsch and Gell-Man QCD in 1973. 
<br>
<p>Taking differences we get the series ~2000, ~123, 48, 14, 34, 6 years.
<br>
It does seem to speed up quite a bit, but of course my resolution is
<br>
extremely crude, we need a more fine-grained measure of physics
<br>
advances. 
<br>
<p>Now, if physics is a limited field we should see things behave like a
<br>
sigmoid or something similar. Maybe the delay in grand unification is a
<br>
sign of that - QCD is after all 28 years old by now. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Economic graphs like education and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturing seem rather beside the point
</em><br>
<p>Actually, they might be good indicators of what is actually done. The
<br>
number of literate people worldwide (per cpaita) is after all an
<br>
objective thing that tells us quite a bit about how we are doing and
<br>
does imply social revolutions just about everywhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I think one can look at aggregate values, like energy production per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; capita, or the efficiency of various motors/generators to get an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; estimate of overall changes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also don't think (as I mentioned with respect to Moore's Law and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population growth) that isolated exponential graphs demonstrate much. Has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone done graphs of miles traveled per capita per year in the first few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decades after the train was deployed, for instance, or casualties per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bowman-hour in the century after the invention of the longbow? I wonder if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are any less exponential.  Without some such control data, it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult to support the hypothesis that there is something special about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today's technological advances compared to those of previous centuries.
</em><br>
<p>Most growth curves are sigmoids, that is why aggregates are interesting.
<br>
For example, the number of miles travelled per capita per year
<br>
regardless of what vehicle is used is a very interesting statistic it
<br>
might be possible to plot over historical times. Another measure might
<br>
be the amount of watts of energy that could be bought by an average
<br>
worker-day's vages. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There would need to be some metric of social significance, and again, I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just not seeing that. All I see on that point is hand-waving. The number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patents issued is going up, therefore we will all be supermen by 2030. Huh?
</em><br>
<p>You are of course right in that all these graphs do not prove that the
<br>
Singularity is coming. But how would a metric of social significance
<br>
help us in that respect either? If the average index of social relevance
<br>
was doubling every 6 years, what would that really tell us? Relevance is
<br>
a qualitative issue.
<br>
<p>So, maybe we should not look for exponential curves, but rather at
<br>
feedback loops driving faster and more pervasive changes. Is technology
<br>
diffusion in (and between) societies increasing? Is the average
<br>
scientist more efficient at solving problems now than in the past? Are
<br>
there any economic feedback loops introducing logics of acceleration?
