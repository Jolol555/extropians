<p>I agree the explanation given doesn't work. Farmers are amazingly successful
<br>
at screwing taxpayers and consumers all over the developed world. The most
<br>
egregious example was here in Britain with BSE where the farmers were bailed
<br>
out to the tune of several billion pounds - can you imagine any other
<br>
industry where after producing a dangerous product they are compensated by
<br>
the taxpayer instead of being sued to hell and back?! Partly it's public
<br>
choice, a small minority easy to organise and mobilise versus a disparate
<br>
mass of voters, but other groups like this are not as universally successful
<br>
as farmers. I think the ultimate reason is the amazingly persistent notion
<br>
that farmers are better than other people and somehow the &quot;basis of the
<br>
nation&quot; because they work on the land and are closer to nature etc. Perhaps
<br>
it goes all the way back to the old republican idea (Cincinnatus and all
<br>
that) that a freeholding peasantry is the basis of a virtuous society.
<br>
Whatever, it's costing the rest of us. Steve Davies
