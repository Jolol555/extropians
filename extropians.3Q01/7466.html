Spike said he didn't understand Larry's proposal for identy cards
<br>
with a big database behind it.  Obviously Larry is trying to sell
<br>
databases.
<br>
<p>The &quot;big brother&quot; database is precisely what I am trying to avoid.
<br>
There already are databases of what passengers are traveling.
<br>
I have no problem with those databases being periodically scanned
<br>
for individuals who are on &quot;watch lists&quot;.  This prevents air
<br>
travel by wanted criminals or potential criminals.  One has to be
<br>
*very* careful regarding for which crimes scanning is allowed.
<br>
It seems to me scanning for felony level crimes is reasonable.
<br>
This gets sticky because then one has to ask what one does
<br>
about felony convicts who have &quot;paid&quot; their debt to society.
<br>
You obviously want to avoid extending this to things like
<br>
scanning for people who have parking violations or unpaid bills.
<br>
[I'll note that a recent Federal Law requires you to give your
<br>
S.S. number when applying for a Driver's licence -- this is
<br>
an attempt to locate fathers with unpaid child support.]
<br>
<p>Once you know the reservation system is being screened for suspects,
<br>
then you have to make sure that the person getting on the plane
<br>
really *is* the person named on the ticket.  Logically this would
<br>
seem to require running the card through a reader at the
<br>
gateway entrance and matching it with a biomemetic scan.
<br>
Unfortunately this means you will have a relatively higher
<br>
cost because you have to have the matching hardware &amp; software
<br>
at each gate.  However, it seems likely to be cheaper than
<br>
the big database approach because with that you have a
<br>
communications requirement as well.  You don't want it at the
<br>
security checkpoint because someone who has breeched airport
<br>
security could attack someone in a lavatory, steal their ticket
<br>
and manage to board the plane.  As Dan points out, face and
<br>
handprint would both be useful.
<br>
<p>The point of all this is that *you* have your identity data
<br>
and not the government.  This avoids the possibility of the
<br>
government monitoring you in public places.
<br>
<p>I suspect that one could design a system that issued all foreign
<br>
nationals such an identity card upon entering the country.
<br>
A face and hand scan and card programming should take more than
<br>
a few minutes IMO.
<br>
