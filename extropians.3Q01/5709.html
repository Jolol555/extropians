<p>
Are there any quantitative arguments to support the argument that the
<br>
twentieth century was one of unparalleled technological acceleration?
<br>
<p>This came up on another mailing list in which a few people were attempting
<br>
to support religious claims about a &quot;new aeon&quot; based in part on the claim
<br>
that the century just ended was witness to unprecedented technological
<br>
acceleration. No one was able to come up with a scholarly source
<br>
demonstrating that, though, and I find I am unsure that it is not a kind of
<br>
horizon effect. Every one of the last eight centuries at least has seen
<br>
major technological changes from the previous century.
<br>
<p>Since this model of techno-acceleration seems to be a major assumption
<br>
behind the idea of the Singularity, I thought perhaps someone here could
<br>
provide some non-anecdotal, empirical backing for it. I don't find anything
<br>
substantive in places like those linked below, which simply state the
<br>
acceleration as if it were an obvious fact.

<p>I have yet to see one of these asymptotic curves that was a real graph, that
<br>
is, one in which both the X and Y axes are some measurable quantity.
<br>
<p>(And yes, I know about Moore's Law. That's not a metric of overall
<br>
technological advancement, only practical computer circuit density. Ditto
<br>
for human population growth.)
