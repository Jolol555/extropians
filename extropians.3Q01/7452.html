<p>If you want to assess the impact of a leader's speech on the cattle it

doesn't require for you to listen to the drivel in person (because you're
<br>
going to be a a) biased b) sample of one), it suffices to go out and ask
<br>
the people, whether they found it moving, and whether they liked &quot;the
<br>
steely glint in his gaze&quot; and whether they think &quot;he has done growed up
<br>
now&quot;.

<p>Um, Murrike is not a secular government. It might be not totally gone
<br>
Christian fundamentalism, but it's halfway there.

</em><br>
<p>True, irrelevant, also unacceptable. Sorry, my tolerance threshold for God
<br>
freaks of any couleur is rather low right now.
