<p><em>&gt;I hope you are joking.  Nuclear is cost-effective now compared to oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without seriously killing an already ailing economy with an arbitrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and utterly unnecessary 100-200% tax on gas.  I can see why anyone 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;our energy needs are not for cars.
</em><br>
<p>We're discussing oil and gas needs, and planes, trucks,
<br>
and automobiles are a huge portion (I think the majority) 
<br>
of oil needs.  Can't put nuke plants on those.  I disagree 
<br>
with the cost analysis even for power plants, given current 
<br>
environmental constraints.  If regs were more reasonable 
<br>
you might be correct for that.
<br>
<p>But whatever the reality, I proposed a plan that allows for it.
<br>
Oil/gas taxes go up gradually, year by year, until imports stop.
<br>
If you're correct imports will stop after a year or two of
<br>
tax increases, and taxes will then stabilize.  Because of the
<br>
nature of the market, you're guaranteed that whatever
<br>
techniques were adopted to stop imports were highly 
<br>
efficient ones, the best that could be developed by 
<br>
millions of highly informed people.
<br>
<p>Tax-induced depressionary effects should be stopped by 
<br>
compensating for revenue increases with reductions in other
<br>
taxes.  That's an important point, and I forgot to mention
<br>
it.
