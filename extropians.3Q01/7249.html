<em>&gt; How about a strong lightweight elastic tube, you fasten the tube to the building throw

</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I saw it too- the tube is a rather sheer braid, and the person
<br>
going thru it can spread out their elbows &amp; knees to slow down, suck in
<br>
to speed up.  The bottom twenty feet gets a bit tighter to slow the
<br>
person down for landing, but I see several problems with this-
<br>
<p>* a very long elastic tube can stretch significantly, so that you have
<br>
to struggle out of the last thirty feet of tube on the ground, a very
<br>
slow process.
<br>
<p>* fire resistance would be nil
<br>
<p>* it requires at least a little skill on the part of the passenger
<br>
<p>A steel cable, harness, and reel with dynamic brake as Spike mentioned
<br>
would be far better.  High rise fires, once out of control, always trap
<br>
people above them.  Spike's addition of oxygen bottles is unnecessary,
<br>
though- there are fire hoods available on the market now that would be
<br>
sufficient for a few seconds passage through a flame.  Incorporate this
<br>
into a nomex overall...
