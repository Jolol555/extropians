<em>&gt; I went to a high school (Lane Tech, Chicago) where &quot;shop&quot; was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amongst the most popular of all classes, probably because you did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things that were actually useful. (It's a guy thing too.)
</em><br>
<p>Shop classes were very popular in schools I have attended (in Illinois,
<br>
Indiana and Florida).  I'm not sure why it is not found in some schools,
<br>
because it is very common in other schools.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our society has so successfully stigmatized the trades that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very difficult to find people to fill these jobs, and contrary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social myth, not just anyone will do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is considered very uncool to end up in the trades these days.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think it was uncool.  I think computer nerds and science nerds were
<br>
uncool, but the shop guys or the jocks never were.  I think the real reason
<br>
people disdain shop is because it is training for a low-wage job.  This is
<br>
the free market at work, showing which jobs are more valued (in dollars)
<br>
than others.  By the way, the jocks with a chance at sports scholarships or
<br>
getting drafted were the most popular heroes on campus.  They expected to be
<br>
rich.  Those who could make it into sports or science went to shop.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I personally think that 'education'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;should only be a minor for college students seeking to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;teachers in grades K-12, that they should have their major in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;real skill area like math, history, or English, etc. Even those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;who wish to become university professors in Education should have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a specialty in a real skill area beyond 'education'.
</em><br>
<p>Believe it or not, this is how it is supposed to be in Florida.
<br>
Unfortunately, those who get a real degree in Computer Science can double
<br>
their salary by going into industry instead of teaching.  As such, the
<br>
schools can't get enough teachers with degrees in their fields.  They
<br>
therefore allow &quot;exemptions&quot; certification of other teachers to fill in, but
<br>
only while degreed teachers are not available.  I think some schools have
<br>
been running over 75% &quot;exception&quot; teachers for many decades now.  I even did
<br>
some teaching before I graduated under the &quot;exception&quot; exemption because I
<br>
was the most qualified computer science teacher they could find at the time.
<br>
I taught three high school quarters during my sophomore year of college.
<br>
<p>I put myself through college and was studying to be a computer science
<br>
teacher.  Florida Tech required me to take every class required for a
<br>
Computer Science B.S. degree plus extra classes in Education and Psychology
<br>
to get certified as a teacher.  By the time I reached my Junior year, I was
<br>
making more at my after-school job than senior teachers were making.  Rather
<br>
than continue to take the extra classes and aim for a pay cut when I
<br>
graduated, I switched to the pure Computer Science major to have an easier
<br>
time graduating and a higher salary after graduating.
