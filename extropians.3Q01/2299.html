</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good point, but the example is odd (I say after the briefest visit to Dr
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plantinga's homepage).
</em><br>
<p>It is an exaggeration to say that Plantinga is single-handedly responsible
<br>
for making Christian analytic philosophy academically respectable. What is
<br>
surpising is how small of an exaggeration it is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Regard this strange assertion:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ========================
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A letter from Plantinga, a philosophy professor, and Huston Smith, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion professor at Berkeley, moved the National Association of Biology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Teachers to remove anti-religious language from its statement on
</em><br>
evolution.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For years, the association's official position read: &quot;The diversity of
</em><br>
life
<br>
<em>&gt; on earth is the outcome of evolution: an unsupervised, impersonal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpredictable and natural process.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Recently, after Plantinga and Smith objected that &quot;unsupervised&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;impersonal&quot; go beyond scientific  evidence, the association dropped those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I was a little surprised, actually, but I was very pleased,&quot; says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plantinga, a member of South Bend Christian Reformed Church who came to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Notre Dame from Calvin College in Grand Rapids, 15 years ago. &quot;It's a
</em><br>
small
<br>
<em>&gt; but significant little thing in the whole debate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;There is so much heat in this area -- people's faith, people's ideology
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; involved-- that often straightforward, rational discussion doesn't work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well.&quot; Plantinga and Smith are among a growing number of Christian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scholars, including scientists, who challenge what they consider the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unscientific presuppositions of modern culture with respect to evolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I think the main thing to see about it is that it is by no means merely a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific doctrine at all,&quot; Plantinga says. &quot;It is about naturalism vs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theism, naturalism vs. American religious belief, naturalism vs.
</em><br>
Christianity.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;They think science has shown that human beings are not really created by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God. That's not true at all. That's not science. That's theology. It's bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theology because it's theology confused with science.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's the point he and Smith argued successfully about the biology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; association's position.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;A good bit of it was theology, not science,&quot; Plantinga says. &quot;There's no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way, simply on the basis of physical science, that you could have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discovered that the process is unsupervised or impersonal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;That's not part of evolutionary theory as science at all. We wondered why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was stated as a piece of science.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unlike those who object to evolutionary theories on religious grounds,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plantinga and others do not insist that the Genesis account of creation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must be taken literally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I'm somebody who thinks God created the world,&quot; Plantinga says. &quot;I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure that's what the Lord intends to teach in that part of Genesis. I
</em><br>
don't
<br>
<em>&gt; know exactly how he did it. It's possible he did it by evolution.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ==================================
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the bacteria changing rapidly in human bodies within the span of a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decades might be doing so *under the personal supervision of a deity*? Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is it under the personal supervision of the devil?
</em><br>
<p>I think Plantinga's view is that God has different levels of involvement:
<br>
God might be happy to let the clock of nature wind-down on its own for the
<br>
most part while occassionally interceding for the occassion miracle, or
<br>
showstopper like Jesus. Thus, it is consistent with his view that Bacteria
<br>
might evolve in humans without God directly supervising this process.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;Cf. his whimsical
<br>
<em>&gt; definition:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt; alvinize, v. To stimulate protracted discussion by making a bizarre
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim. &quot;His contention that natural evil is due to Satanic agency
</em><br>
alvinized
<br>
<em>&gt; his listeners.&quot; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Just to be clear, this is not his own definition of himself, it is in
<br>
Dennett's humour book.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I assume Dr Alvin P. does find this a bizarre assertion;
</em><br>
<p>This is a little unfair, or at least misleading. Remember the definition is
<br>
meant to be humorous. This is a little complicated but I will try to boil it
<br>
down: Plantinga wrote a free will defence in response to the problem of
<br>
evil. He was responding to the charge that there is a logical contradiction
<br>
between the assertion that God exists and the presence of evil in this
<br>
world. He takes the point of a theodicy (he calls it a 'defense') to
<br>
demonstrate the (mere) logical POSSIBILITY that God and evil might exist. In
<br>
the course of this discussion Plantinga suggested that it is POSSIBLE that
<br>
natural evil (earth quakes, etc.) are the result of Satanic agency. I agree.
<br>
It is possible. It just seems to me that it is highly improbable. But this
<br>
would not affect the logic of Plantiga's argument. One of the most common
<br>
criticisms of Plantinga free will defence is that it does not go far enough:
<br>
a theodicy should explain why God allows evil, not simply say that it is
<br>
logically possible. (I actually think that his defense doesn't allow him to
<br>
wriggle out of the contradiction).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I regard his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertion--that we might any longer regard stochastic evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes as under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the guiding hand of a god--exactly as ridiculous. I'm ashamed that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; National Association of Biology Teachers caved in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I was suprised they caved in. But then again, there are a surprising number
<br>
of religious scientist. I think I read some stats on this in the last few
<br>
years. Perhaps it was in Scientific American. (I only read that rag in the
<br>
grocery store line-up).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But maybe Dr Plantinga has more intelligent things to say elsewhere. Got a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific paper you'd recommend, Mark?
</em><br>
<p>No, just read his entire corpus. I think you can get a reasonable idea of
<br>
his views on evolution from the following:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.asa3.org/ASA/dialogues/Faith-reason/CRS9-91Plantinga1.html">http://www.asa3.org/ASA/dialogues/Faith-reason/CRS9-91Plantinga1.html</a>
<br>
<p>I saw him give a version of this talk &quot;An Evolutionary Argument Against
<br>
Naturalism&quot; (I wish the full thing was available)
<br>
<p><a href="http://hisdefense.org/articles/ap001.html">http://hisdefense.org/articles/ap001.html</a>
<br>
a couple of years ago at the Canadian Philosophical Association where he
<br>
gave the Plenary address. (He was very funny. The guy that introduced him
<br>
rambled off 18 prestigious universities where Plantinga has been a &quot;visiting
<br>
distinguished professor&quot;. Plantinga got up and the first thing he said was
<br>
that being at 18 universities makes it sound like he couldn't hold down a
<br>
job).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Or am I missing a meta-point, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're poking fun at this `luminary'?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
No, you are not. We know (or more judiciously, believe) that Plantinga's
<br>
conclusion is false. So either the logic of his argument is faulty, or one
<br>
or more premise is false. Since Plantinga is pretty handy with logic, our
<br>
best bet is that we disagree about the premises. But, having said this,
<br>
Plantinga seems to me as rational as any atheist I know (and in fact, more
<br>
so than most atheists that I know). My point is that to say that religion is
<br>
irrational because some or even many of its adherents are not as rational as
<br>
they might be does not show that all adherents must be. This is the strategy
<br>
of arguing &quot;guilt by association&quot;--something that first year of uni is
<br>
supposed to help us get over.  I am not particularly bothered by the fact
<br>
that many of those who are less than ideally (humanly) rational--perhaps
<br>
through no fault of their own--believe in the religious hypothesis, indeed,
<br>
this is perhaps quite understandable. It is when I see enormously
<br>
intellectually gifted philosophers and scientists believing in the religious
<br>
that I am unsettled. For then the hypothesis that it must be a failure of
<br>
rationality on their part looks a lot more questionable. Mark.
