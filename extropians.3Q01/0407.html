</em><br>
<p>Being a socialist has nothing to do with whether you consider yourself
<br>
a cyborg.  You seem to have gotten confused by the Star Trek name &quot;Borg&quot;
<br>
and think that cyborgs are collective entities.  Instead, cyborgs
<br>
are cybernetic organisms, that is, organisms which have cybernetic
<br>
enhancements or implants.  It has nothing to do with socialism.
<br>
Cyborgs could be of any political party whatsoever.
<br>
<p>Obviously today the opportunities for cybernetic enhancement are limited.
<br>
I took the thrust of Helen's question to be a matter of self-definition.
<br>
Some people may think of themselves as cyborgs, or proto-cyborgs, in
<br>
that they choose to take advantage of whatever cybernetic opportunities
<br>
are available.  To the maximum degree possible, they simulate the effect
<br>
of having cybernetic implants.  Perhaps they carry a wireless Internet
<br>
access device and/or wear a heads-up display.
<br>
<p>Some of these people may define themselves as cyborgs in order to direct
<br>
and focus their thoughts towards future enhancements.  To some extent,
<br>
you are what you define yourself to be, what you choose to be.  It is
<br>
these people that Helen is hoping to contact.
<br>
