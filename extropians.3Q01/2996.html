</em><br>
<p>&lt;Note, I think Sean (I think it was) has answered this well. -- R.B.&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We don't have list rules against uncomfortable subjects.  We do have list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rules against ad hominem.  Stating that blacks cannot achieve as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whites is ad hominem.  It attacks the person as invalid rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussing any person's actions, topics, theories, actions, statements, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It was persuasive rather than objective.
</em><br>
<p>A few reflections in what I hope is now the aftermath. I think Lee agreed 
<br>
that there was a racist element in the article in one of his posts, even if 
<br>
he has not agreed with every aspect of Harvey's criticism. I don't really 
<br>
see Lee as an opponent here.
<br>
<p>I haven't actually used the word &quot;racist&quot; myself - I merely said that the 
<br>
article is impatient with blacks, bordering on hostile, sometimes crossing 
<br>
that border. Such hostility may well be motivated by racism, but it may just 
<br>
be motivated by a &quot;fed up&quot; feeling with contemporary black culture and black 
<br>
leaders (as opposed to thinking black people are evil or inferior). For me, 
<br>
even such a &quot;fed up&quot; feeling would be worthy of rebuke for various reasons. 
<br>
Furthermore, I had a look at the site which Joe Dees posted. Sorry Joe, but 
<br>
I have to say that I am politically incorrect enough to have found some good 
<br>
sense in some of the articles on that site, eg the attack on the egregious 
<br>
Andrea Dworkin in one article seemed quite justified. However, there is an 
<br>
uneay drift towards and into racism and sexism in some of the material.
<br>
<p>I do largely agree with Harvey's literary critical analysis, though I'm 
<br>
surprised it was necessary to do such an elaborate piece of practical 
<br>
criticism to make the point. With a piece like this, skilled readers (which 
<br>
is all of us, no?) can be reasonably confident of their perceptions of tone 
<br>
without taking the piece apart line by line, which sometimes just raises the 
<br>
(wrong) question as to where the &quot;tone&quot; came from (a little like taking a 
<br>
brain apart and failing to find the conscious bit).
<br>
<p>OTOH, I am uncomfortable about list rules. I think anyone should be free to 
<br>
say pretty much what they like. If someone becomes too annoying, he or she 
<br>
will simply get universally plonked. Moreover, if offensive material is 
<br>
being posted the answer is surely to reply with more speech, not to impose 
<br>
censorship.
<br>
<p>I do understand Sean's (I think) comment about the list having to be a 
<br>
secret from his friends. For me, there is a dissonance between, on one hand, 
<br>
the emphasis on science and technology and social freedom (which I like very 
<br>
much) and economic freedom (which I also favour, despite reservations about 
<br>
corporations and private property that I express from time to time) and, on 
<br>
the other hand, the impatient attitudes to racial issues, for example, that 
<br>
sometimes come out. There's a whole sophisticated literature *in Australia 
<br>
alone* about these issues. I know that there's a much vaster literature in 
<br>
the US, but I tend to focus more on our local problems arising from 
<br>
Aboriginal dispossession etc. Surely, as good, intelligent citizens of our 
<br>
countries, we should be reading this and responding to it thoughtfully and, 
<br>
above all, patiently. In the Australian context, I don't think anyone can 
<br>
discuss the issues sensibly without having read, say, Raimond Gaita's work, 
<br>
with care. Olga and others can name the American equivalents.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From my pov, one of the good things about the modern global mercantilist 
</em><br>
economy is that it generates vast wealth, some of which (not the majority, 
<br>
or there is no incentive for the system to flourish) is available to be 
<br>
redistributed into disadvantaged communities and so on (not to mention 
<br>
hospitals, universities, medical research centres etc). To me, this kind of 
<br>
redistribution *is* a legitimate role for the state - whereas a decision by 
<br>
the American theocracy to impose moral views about stem cell research or 
<br>
therapeutic cloning or safe reproductive cloning is *not* a legitimate role 
<br>
for the state - as I argue ad nauseum in my off-list work. I think that 
<br>
these distinctions are rationally sustainable, but that is a point for 
<br>
another thread.
<br>
<p>My point for the moment is that I think people like Sean and Harvey, who 
<br>
evidently share some of views above (which seem to be called, pejorativley, 
<br>
&quot;welfarist&quot; on this list), should simply be prepared to put them more often 
<br>
and change the balance of the opinions expressed here. Perhaps the opinions 
<br>
being expressed are not typical of the views actually held by list members.
<br>
<p>I am glad that J.R. has gone a bit quiet overnight my time (got to sleep 
<br>
some time eh, J.R.?), but I wouldn't like to see his colourful (shit, that 
<br>
word was not intended as a pun, Damien) views suppressed in any way.
