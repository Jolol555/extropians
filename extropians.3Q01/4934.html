<em>&gt;   Public education DOES sanction discrimination, I never had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle who couldn't speak English properly (i.e. correct grammer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and pronunciation) while attending the &quot;intolerant&quot; private schools,
</em><br>
Olga replied
<br>
&lt;I don't understand what you wrote.  The kind of discrimination practiced by
<br>
public schools (as was done in the past) allowing segregation based on race,
<br>
or the reading of the New Testament - that is what I was talking about.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;As is done in the present.  The vice-princ. of the public high school I
<br>
attended
<br>
had a job because of EO. Ditto with the thuggery (which would have been
<br>
far far worse if I was one of just a few white kids in the school).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Insofar as education has become more &quot;non-discriminatory&quot; (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; official version I mean) and &quot;democratic&quot; it has commenced to suck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more and more.  This is only my opinion and experience speaking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   If you honestly believe that not discriminating based on &quot;religion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethnicity, class and what have you&quot; is worth having nearly illiterate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persons wandering about the Republic, well to be extremely nice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it..I'm split between feeling pity and revulsion.
</em><br>
<p>Are you saying that public schools should revert back to how they were
<br>
before Brown v. Board of Education? (and that that would result in better
<br>
public schools?).&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;Uh..no. I say we demolish or auction of the public schools and let the
<br>
ghetto folks handle their own affairs. Whitebread baptists homeschool
<br>
their kids, the urban blacks can do the same.  Can't they? (said with
<br>
a straight face).  I mean if we are all instrinsically equal..how could
<br>
this be anything other than a blessing.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW Strawman tactic duly noted. Avoid it in the future please.
<br>
<p>&lt;comments on the Boy Scouts snipped...huh?&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;   If you think public education is all that... wait 20 years and look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the number of homeschooled kids who become professionals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vs. the criminal farms we have now.
</em><br>
<p>It's a continual wonder to me that I, my children, friends, acquaintances
<br>
and relatives all seem to have come out of these criminal farms unscathed,
<br>
educated and ... have even lived to tell about it.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>And I surmise..you didn't go to school in Anacostia (S DC) or Cabrini Green
<br>
now did you ma'am?  Besides..you read lots. Literate people tend to
<br>
befriend literate people.  Who are often autodidacts.  Which minimizes
<br>
the detrimental effects. Granted I'm not throwing stats around to
<br>
negate your comment..but your comment was anecdotal in the extreme.
