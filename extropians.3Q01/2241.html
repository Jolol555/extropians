<p>True, I should retract the tar balls.  They can come from oil, but they also

can be natural.  I have no idea what percentage of tarring on our beach is
<br>
natural and how much is artificial.

</em><br>
<p>I guess I'm missing the problem here.  Certainly fixing leaking toilets to
<br>
stop wasting water is a good thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I guess the folks that wrote that ad wont like my idea for soaking up

</em><br>
<p>This seems strange, Spike.  You seem to be against fixing toilet valves to
<br>
save water, but then you propose turning the grassy western U.S. plains into
<br>
vast forests instead.  Will you grab all that land from the ranchers to grow
<br>
the forests?  Will you ban logging to keep the forests from being cut down
<br>
as fast as it grows?  Do you think storing enough water inland to lower sea
<br>
levels is technically easier than curbing pollution?  It almost seems like
<br>
your easy alternative is worse than the current suggestions which you
<br>
dislike.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying that you are wrong, but I am suddenly struck at how the
<br>
solutions proposed on this list seem to be harsher than the regulatory
<br>
changes currently being proposed.  I have seen proposals for flooding the
<br>
Caspian Sea, filling Death Valley, putting dikes around Florida, turning
<br>
Antarctica into farmland, etc.  Such major eco-engineering of the planet
<br>
seem costlier than some pollution regulations, except that the costs are
<br>
deferred from us/now to someone else later.
