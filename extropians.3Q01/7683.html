Assume that you are George W. Bush's senior science policy adivosor.  (This
<br>
means that you are NOT an anarcho-capitalist or even a libertarian -- try it
<br>
as an exercise for fun.)  Now assume that you have become convinced (which
<br>
wouldn't be hard to do) that one of the most rigid constraints on US foreign
<br>
policy is the industrialized world's dependence on Middle Eastern oil.  In
<br>
recent briefings you have become despondent over the intractable nature of
<br>
the conflict between the Enlightenment cultural values you hold as a
<br>
scientist and the Islamic revivalist movement that is the most dynamic
<br>
political and social force throughout that region.  You want to propose some
<br>
means of decreasing the West's dependence on fossil fuels.
<br>
<p>Question: What would you propose?
<br>
<p>Is a government initiative on the scale of the Manhattan or Apollo project
<br>
something that could address the problem?  If so, what would its R&amp;D targets
<br>
be?  You would want to develop R&amp;D goals that would require the least
<br>
disruption of current social and economic life, so the use of as much of
<br>
existing modes of transportation as possible should be desirable.  You want
<br>
maningful results as soon as possible, with a reasonably high chance for
<br>
success.
<br>
<p>You have the president's ear.  What would you say?
