<p>An excellent idea, but I think, it needs some refinement:
<br>
<p>First of all: all small states whithout wise leadership
<br>
are potential breeding ground of terrorists. Of course it is not
<br>
pleasent to fight against nations which have nuclear weaponry.
<br>
My suggestion is a huge alliance of all states with nuclear weapons.
<br>
These are mainly those countries which are somewhat advanced, so the
<br>
other countries can be considered to be neglectible or simply
<br>
harmful for the singularity. My vision is a great &quot;peace-making&quot; effort
<br>
of USA,Europe,Russia,China,India, Pakistan and Israel. They have the 
<br>
the power to get rid of all evil on earth. 
<br>
<p>I am quite certain that there is enough nuclear bomb and missile there
<br>
to eradicate the whole middle east, Africa(they are only spreading
<br>
AIDS, anyhow). We could set an elegant and effective end to the drug
<br>
war by weeping out South-America also. (Just think of the lives of the
<br>
lot of policemen and potantial drug addicts, we can save that way.)
<br>
<p>I believe that this would be brightest day of humanity. After this day,
<br>
we woud see optimistically in future and could work undistracted towards
<br>
the singularity, heil!
