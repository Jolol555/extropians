<p><em>&gt; &gt; Here's an interesting tidbit: a friend of mine who

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nonetheless when he did this he used the same blade

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This happens to me on a regular basis with no pyramid.

<em>&gt; Other than my head, the little bit of hair I have is

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Or to put it another way: Randi's lab is deep in the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would expect some phenomenal things to happen there
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a fun thing to do--there are many claims of psychic

</em><br>
<em>&gt; *easily* in a lab, hostile or not. Maybe in another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lab that is not so hostile, with a ton of observers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe it is about time, once and for all. Any ideas?
</em><br>
<p>How about defining these &quot;psychic phenomena&quot; first? Teleportation was
<br>
considered to be a psychic phenomenon long before anyone demonstrated it
<br>
in a physics lab. Bilocation was also considered to be a psychic
<br>
phenomenon before demonstrated in physics labs. And the observer effect is
<br>
PK is it not?
