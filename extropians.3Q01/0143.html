<em>&gt; Regarding Stossel's list of countries that allowed the use of RGBH, I recall 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeing South Africa and some mideast countries that have become rick due to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oil.  I thus wouldn't say that &quot;all were Third World countries.&quot;  For that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter, I would not put Venezula and Mexico in the same category as, say, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chad and Ethiopia.
</em><br>
<p>I've gone back and checked my recording, and the specific list was:
<br>
Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras,
<br>
Jordan, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, South Africa, South
<br>
Korea, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United States, and Venezuela.
<br>
<p>Leading up to this, Stossels shows a protestor saying, &quot;This is the only
<br>
country, the only industrialized nation in the world, that allows the
<br>
use of RBGH...&quot;
<br>
<p>He responds in voice over, &quot;I'd be more sympathetic to their complaints
<br>
if they always told the truth.  But they don't.&quot;
<br>
<p>Another(?) protestor says, &quot;It is the only country which eats recombinent
<br>
bovine growth hormone.&quot;
<br>
<p>Stossel asks her, &quot;And America is the only place that allows this?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;But that's not true.  Lots of other countries allow bovine growth
<br>
hormone.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Which ones?&quot;
<br>
<p>We cut to a picture of some cows, and Stossel says in voice over,
<br>
&quot;All these countries have approved it,&quot; and a scrolling list appears
<br>
superimposed on the cows, with the list of countries above.
<br>
<p>So my problems with this are, first as I said above, the only country
<br>
in the traditionally defined &quot;First World&quot; on the list is the U.S.
<br>
It's true that countries such as South Africa, Brazil, South Korea are
<br>
far from the poorest on earth, but still you see no European countries,
<br>
no Japan, no Australia.  By and large the countries on the list are still
<br>
struggling in the world and the U.S. is definitely the odd man out.
<br>
So while the protestors' claims were not literally true, the fact is
<br>
that the United States' policies are at odds with other countries in
<br>
its peer group, which is the thrust of the point they are making.
<br>
<p>Secondly, Stossel claims that the protestors are not telling the
<br>
truth, which carries the connotation that they are intentionally lying.
<br>
Otherwise he would have said that they were mistaken or misinformed or
<br>
incorrect.  But it seemed clear from his conversation with the protestor
<br>
that she was sincere and either was not aware that other countries used
<br>
RBGH, or else that she was speaking in the context of an unstated (or
<br>
at least unshown) assumption that they were talking about the wealthy
<br>
industrialized countries that the U.S. would normally be compared with.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In another example, an activist complained about the use of recombinant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;bovine growth hormone (RBGH).  She said that the U.S. was the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;industrialized country to allow its use.  Later she simplified that to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that the U.S. was the only country which allowed it.  Stossel challenged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;her and put up a quickly-scrolling list of other countries that allowed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the use of RGBH.  There were 20 or more and it made her look bad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;But if you looked closely at the list, all were Third World countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Venezuela, Mexico, etc., all poor nations.
