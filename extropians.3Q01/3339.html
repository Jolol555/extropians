<p>All people should be afraid.  Technologies that could cure many
<br>
misfortunes and produce near-miraculous things are being killed
<br>
when they are barely in their infancy out of fear and
<br>
ignorance.  Government is abrogating to itself levels of power
<br>
that I see no even remote Constitutional justification for.  And
<br>
no real hue and cry is raised.  We have become so inured of
<br>
meaningless pressure group warfare in place of real political
<br>
sanity (if that is not an oxymoron) that we just assumed
<br>
someone's ox will be gored (no offense to the other guy) and
<br>
that their is nothing to be done but to hope it isn't yours this
<br>
time around.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; a strong assertion that such organizations of matter can

<em>&gt; hide themselves from detection or elimination.  If you cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make that case then it does not matter whether or not such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizations of matter can be &quot;trusted&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If it moves fast enough it will be unstoppable regardless of how
<br>
well it can be detected.  Trust will come from a reorganization
<br>
of our expectations and how we see the world and operate as a
<br>
consequence.  It will not come from the same old MAD games.  The
<br>
context is too radically fast and different for the old games to
<br>
work.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; All it takes is one Blight to wipe us out. That kind of threat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; does not go away as humans progress to transhumanity, rather it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; increases in likelihood. What is the stable state if not Sysop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or total death? There may be some other possibilities, can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you name some?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, evolution in an upward spiral committed to extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles seems like a stable state.   Note that this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an unstable state for humanity as it likely concludes that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the instantiation of organized matter as &quot;humans&quot; is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inefficient use of the locally available resources and must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be concluded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Regardless of what said humans do or do not think about the
<br>
matter?  Are there some things more sacred than maximum
<br>
efficient usage of local resources?  How about having the value
<br>
of all sentients no matter how &quot;inefficient&quot; as a central value
<br>
to be preserved where at all possible?  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; So, the question would be, can one (as an extropian)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide a coherent defense of the use of the material
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and energy required for you to remain &quot;intact&quot; in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light of more efficient reallocation of the resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are consuming?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Who the hell cares whether I can or cannot &quot;coherently defend&quot;
<br>
my right to the resources I consume?  Who says I need to?  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; This is the moral problem -- Are you committed to the evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of matter to its highest extropic state or are you committed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the preservation of oneself in a form that seems comfortable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No, I am not commited to the &quot;evolution of matter to its highest
<br>
extropic state&quot;.  I am committed to the highest evolution and
<br>
well-being of sentient beings, including humans.  All of them. 
<br>
You don't junk some of them because you can think of a more
<br>
efficient use of the resources or could build a more interesting
<br>
sentient being out of the parts.  To do so denies the value of
<br>
sentient beings (real &quot;people&quot;) completely.  It leads one
<br>
seeking Borg perfection by ripping apart and ignoring the value
<br>
of all that is alive. It is a hideous vision that I will have no
<br>
part of.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Do the needs of the many (the potential application of the atoms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at our disposal) outweigh the needs of the one (your personal survival)?
</em><br>
<p>We don't live in a zero-sum game unless we chose to.
