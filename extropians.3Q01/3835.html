<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; And what is the &quot;point&quot; of this? I am just saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;multiculturalism&quot; is more than a cheap slogan. Different races and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; peoples have developed different cultures. Why not leave them in peace to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; enjoy those cultures as they wish?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Because 'multiculturalism' is not about enjoying your native culture. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;enjoy my scottish and italian cultural origins very much, thanks, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;am not a citizen of Scotland OR Italy, and I will not put the interests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of either country, or its citizens, or its culture, ahead of America.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;America is my native and primary culture. 'Hyphenated Americans', who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;place their ethnic orgins first, ahead of their status as Americans,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;damage our republic. They encourage sectarianism, tribalism, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;inter-ethnic strife, of the sort we see in the Balkan states so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;these days. I would think that anyone with intelligence would see that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Yugoslavia is an excellent example of what NOT to do with a country, yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;allegedly intelligent liberals want to do the exact same thing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;America.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just like one can be conservative without being a Turner Diaries ethnic cleanser, one can be liberal without being a card-carrying Balkanizer.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but that doesn't answer my point. The road to hell is paved with
<br>
good intentions, Joe, and what occured in Germany in the 1930's is a
<br>
direct result of those 'democratizing', liberal, policies enacted from
<br>
good intentions in the 1920's.
<br>
<p>We have some rather significant checks in our system to protect against
<br>
this occuring here for good reason. While one could argue that
<br>
eliminating them may not cause any harm so long as everybody acts in
<br>
good faith, the system is designed to function  even when a large number
<br>
of people are acting in bad faith, as so many actors in the current day
<br>
political process are doing.
<br>
<p>The system is designed to function even with some incompetent leaders,
<br>
and with some degree of citizens who do not take the responsibilities of
<br>
citizenship seriously. Multiculturalism is, simply put, a movement to
<br>
strip away these protections, to eliminate the last vestiges of the
<br>
system of cultural assimilation that is necessary to maintain some
<br>
relatively high level of trust that is needed to keep a free republic
<br>
operating.
<br>
<p>Those who advocate doing so may be acting from good intentions, but this
<br>
is irrelevant. It is the unintended consequences that always cause
<br>
civilizations to fall.
