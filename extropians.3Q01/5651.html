<p>Wow.  <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.sg/consular/faq/ns.html">http://www.mfa.gov.sg/consular/faq/ns.html</a> appears to confirm
<br>
all of this.  Surely egress is among the most fundamental rights;
<br>
or perhaps I heard too many stories of East German border guards
<br>
gunning down those attempting to leave without permission (North
<br>
Korea apparently still murders those escaping to the south, though
<br>
means other than bullets may be used, bullets being rather expensive).
<br>
<p>Although I oppose it, I understand the rationale for Singapore's
<br>
reliance on draftees.  I don't understand such strong measures to
<br>
ensure that no young male flees the country.  How effective can
<br>
such soldiers be?
<br>
<p>It seems to me that if some flexibility in the terms of service
<br>
were offered and women were included, Singapore could have more
<br>
than enough soldiers for its defense without such harsh penalties
<br>
for those who want badly enough to avoid the draft that they would
<br>
leave the country.
<br>
<p>You have my sympathy, not that it'll do you any good.
