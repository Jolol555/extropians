<p>Oh, Olga.  You miss my point entirely.  Here you are again
<br>
speaking in defense of liberalism, and you are already a
<br>
liberal!  It doesn't count to say, &quot;oh in my misguided youth
<br>
I was a conservative; but I repent!&quot;.  Do you understand how
<br>
your example was self-serving to your present ideological
<br>
beliefs?   I mean today.  With all the arguments and facts
<br>
from intelligent all over this list, on both sides.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; (P.P.S.  I don't think any of them will.)

</em><br>
<p>Hey, it is just a prediction.  So far, no one has (well, I still
<br>
have about 10 posts yet to read, so as of this writing maybe someone
<br>
will).  We shall see.
