<em>&gt; &gt;The problem, of course, is with concentrations of force and dependencies

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That might be a valid point. But you could fix that with anti-trust laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for that particular market.
</em><br>
<p>Who adjudicates your anti-trust laws? You'd need even larger
<br>
organizations to enforce them, whereupon you've violated your anti-trust
<br>
law in attempting to enforce them. In the market of force, beyond aiding
<br>
those not physically able to defend themselves, any delegation to others
<br>
is a monopolistic concentration.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Governments come about specifically because of this blind spot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Individuals too squeamish to do their own dirty work empower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;amalgamations of force through security subcontracting that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;overwhelm other individuals who are not so inclined.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This seems like utopian thinking, expecting too much of the people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How would your citizen education program stop members in families,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partners of businesses, groups of families, and so on, from joining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forces?
</em><br>
<p>I say that unless you are physically unable to defend yourself,
<br>
delegating or exerting force on behalf of others is a monopolistic use
<br>
of force. Parents can defend children, oldsters, and the disabled.
<br>
Grouping in defensive reaction to the improper concentration of force by
<br>
others is fine, but only for a limited period to take action to
<br>
eliminate the concentration. All concentrations that occur must have
<br>
stated purposes and expiration dates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another problem is to distinguish between products and services. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trend that more and more product become services is generally sound.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gives you more flexibibility and focus on customer value. What's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference between a protection agency and an advanced intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defence system?
</em><br>
<p>A defence system that is oriented in what direction? 
<br>
<p>The protection agency is located elsewhere and is mobile, it can project
<br>
force at a distance in an offensive manner. A defence system based on
<br>
the property of the owner can only defend that property.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;As soon as a person hires a large group to exert force for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;them, all parties the person deals with are no longer operating in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;free market, nor is the person operating in a free market with respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to the large group they have hired. If the large group mandates that its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;clients be unarmed, then they are totally at the mercy of the large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;group.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The group vs the individual is irrelevant. The balance of forces is not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your requirement for complete indivual balance seems theoretical. In practice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there will always be huge differences in strength.
</em><br>
<p>Only because they are permitted, and those who are weak are forcibly
<br>
kept weak by those with large force assets (gun control, weapons
<br>
proliferations laws, etc)
