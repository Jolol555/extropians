<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I also think you have an inflated idea of what a hate crime is.  Hate crimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; give tougher sentences on criminals who commit violent crimes.  They do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; arrest people for mere words or ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I would disagree with this.  The hate crime law does not give tougher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sentences based on the violence of the crime.  They give tougher sentences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; based on what the perp was thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you have misread what Harvey wrote, in saying that you disagree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nothing you have written is inconsistent with what Harvey said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He did not say that the tougher sentences are based on violence of crimes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as you suggest.  He said that the idea of hate crime laws is to increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentences, not to arrest people for certain words.  (I have lost the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context of his remarks, but perhaps someone had suggested that hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime laws involved arresting people for saying hateful things.)
</em><br>
<p>Well, they have, and it happened up here in Vermont, right across the
<br>
river from me in White River Junction. A black cop was dealing with a
<br>
drunk and disorderly individual when the individual used a racial
<br>
epithet. Cop thereby arrested the individual, charging them with the D&amp;D
<br>
as well as a charge for an entirely separate hate crime violation. The
<br>
D&amp;D charge was dropped, but the individual was convicted on the hate
<br>
crime alone, with jail time, probation and fine. 
<br>
<p>The perp was a woman, BTW, and claimed that was not her intent, that she
<br>
was drunk and did not mean what she said, and apologized.
