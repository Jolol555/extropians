<br>
<p>Eliezer's gloss on sexual selection is much too negative.  It implies
<br>
that 
<br>
it's usually subject to hijacking, rather than usually based on
<br>
something 
<br>
that is not a &quot;cheap signal&quot;.  (Robin, is there an accepted term for the 
<br>
opposite of a cheap signal?)
<br>
<p>I think all the examples  referred to in the gloss (antlers, peacock's
<br>
tail, 
<br>
intelligence) have been justified reasonably well as expensive signals
<br>
that 
<br>
are good fitness markers.  If they were not so, it's likely that the 
<br>
process Eli described would have been able to hijack the signals, and
<br>
end up 
<br>
driving the species extinct.  Doesn't the fact that these species
<br>
continue to 
<br>
survive give us some reason to believe that sexual selection, while
<br>
arguably 
<br>
stupid, isn't destructive in the observed cases?  
<br>
<p>Of course, we don't know how many cases there have been in which a runaway
<br>
process of sexual selection process *was* hijacked, ending up in a
<br>
species or 
<br>
sub-species disappearing.  But I don't know of any evidence that this is 
<br>
common, or more prevalent than the benign or useful effect.  Eliezer,
<br>
what 
<br>
made you decide to present this topic in such a negative light?
<br>
