<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; The Tampa police are using three dozen security cameras
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; equipped with face-recognition software to search for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; criminal suspects among people in a downtown district.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;What is so bad about this idea?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I can think of several problems (quite apart from the general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue of an &quot;expectation of privacy&quot; which was alluded to).
</em><br>
<p>But would one feel that one's privacy were invaded by actual
<br>
human detectives surveying crowds with binoculars?  They used
<br>
to, you know.  I recall reading about how in England one
<br>
detective was so obsessed with the Great Train Robbery that
<br>
he spent most of his free time watching crowds for his man.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. This use of technology can be misused in all sorts of obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and dangerous ways by goverments and law enfocement agencies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course you are free to believe the police would never misuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their power, or that governments are completely benign institutions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but then I would soon expect to see flights of migrating pigs.
</em><br>
<p>Quite right.  But still, perhaps I don't fully understand what
<br>
the difference is between this and conventional surveillance.
<br>
How excited would anyone have been a number of years ago if
<br>
the London constabulary had made it known that a certain human
<br>
policeman had a photographic memory, an uncanny eye, and was
<br>
being used to watch large crowds?  Yawn.
<br>
<p>Take the extreme case if you want:  the police have public cameras
<br>
everywhere, and a database of driver's license pictures.  All they
<br>
need to do is type in someone's name, and if he or she is out in
<br>
public anywhere, they can monitor that person.  How different in
<br>
principle is this from having a detective assigned to follow that
<br>
person?  Are we merely objecting to efficiency?  (Again, I'm not
<br>
sure that anyone would ever had objected if it were known, say, 
<br>
that the Liverpool police happened to have an unlimited budget
<br>
for surveillance by human policemen, and could authorize that
<br>
anyone or any number of people be followed.)  Thanks, Lee
