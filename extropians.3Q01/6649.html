<p><em>&gt; I've been submerged for a few days, but yesterday I bolted together a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lengthy analysis of the situation, as I see it. Here it is.
</em><br>
<p>Just some random comments. I realize you may not have had extropians as
<br>
the audience for your essay in mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You'd think that every possible angle would already have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      covered by people writing about the events of September 11th.
</em><br>
<p>Not by a long shot. We need to deconstruct this event in detail. It may
<br>
take years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Because in all the media coverage I've seen so far, nobody has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      asking the right, the important, questions. Like: why did this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      happen, what circumstances got us into a de facto state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      undeclared war with the Islamic world,
</em><br>
<p>Why is an issue for historians. I'm more concerned with moving forward
<br>
and preventing such things in the future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and what can we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      realistically do to prevent those circumstances from ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      recurring.
</em><br>
<p>What we can do may have little to do with the 'why' we got to here.
<br>
Maybe we can do something just by increasing the possible solution
<br>
space.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      Some of you in the US are going to wonder why I, in the UK, am
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      bothering with this. I'm 3000 miles away from New York, in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      country that wasn't directly affected;
</em><br>
<p>I'm not wondering. The worldwide outpouring of shock and grief is
<br>
palpable. Also, from the media I understand 100 Britons died in the
<br>
attack and that this is thus the largest single loss of British lives in
<br>
a terrorist attack. A horrible event has happened and civilized people
<br>
the world over are appalled.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (And
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      there seems precious little scope for good in it right now.)
</em><br>
<p>Really? Consider a lack of imagination. I can see lots of good coming
<br>
from this. Evil too, but nonetheless we are in a powerful time right
<br>
now. The air is electric. Channel the energies correctly and all sorts
<br>
of benefits to the world and mankind can come from this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To understand why it happened we have to go back to the 19th
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      century, or even earlier. And if we fail to understand its roots,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      we run the risk of failing to prevent similar events from happening
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      in future.
</em><br>
<p>There was an editorial in the Washington Post today suggesting that if
<br>
we don't have a military action real soon, we run the risk of increasing
<br>
prejudice against arab-americans and muslims in the U.S. Maybe killing a
<br>
few mostly innocent people in Afghanistan now might prevent the drive-by
<br>
killing of entirely innocent muslims living in the U.S. Or, maybe not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even a massed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      thermonuclear strike on the Islamic world, followed by a campaign
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      of genocide directed against a quarter of the world's population,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      won't stop this from happening again.
</em><br>
<p>Well, maybe, but it would reduce the chances of it happening again for a
<br>
while. Just have geiger counters at security check-ins and refuse
<br>
admission of swarthy radioactive people. In any case I consider this
<br>
possibility so remote that I'm not sure why you even bring it up.
<br>
<p>I'm gonna skip the history since I don't have any mastery -- or, at this
<br>
point -- real interest in that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    want to see a middle east where angry young adults with a political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    point to make think in terms of writing to their elected
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    representatives, rather than strapping on bombs and committing suicide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    because that's the only way to make their voice heard.
</em><br>
<p>I want to see a world where angry young adults with a political point to
<br>
make actually go out there and accomplish something using intelligence
<br>
and organizational skills and not involving mass violence. Maybe they
<br>
can earn some money and send a big check along with their letters. What
<br>
is the standard bribe to get your letter really considered today anyway?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    People who have freedom and wealth do not make good suicide bombers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Go ask the Japanese about it if you don't believe me and want a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    first-hand opinion.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I see your point, but remember that the recent suicide bombers
<br>
were here (in the U.S.), maybe for years, and bankrolled. It seems at
<br>
any time they could have defected and spent the rest of their natural
<br>
lives protected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    I want to see a world where the people of the middle east don't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    themselves as victims of a savage occupation by forces of a hostile
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    evangelical religion bent on stripping them of their natural resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    and keeping them divided
</em><br>
<p>Huh? I can easily see most of the world population as victims of a
<br>
savage occupation by forces of a hostile evangelical religion bent on
<br>
stripping them of their natural resources and keeping them divided. Why
<br>
should the middle east get such special consideration?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    And most importantly, I want to see a world where we do not lose our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    most precious liberties in the name of security and vigilance against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    a threat that should never have been allowed to materialise in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    You can be sure of one thing: if the threat of islamic terrorism isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    defeated, we will lose our liberties in the name of security.
</em><br>
<p>We're likely to lose our liberties in the name of security whatever
<br>
happens to the threat of islamic terrorism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    This shouldn't be seen as a war against terrorism; rather, it's an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    opportunity to extend to the rest of the world the lessons [...]
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like colonialism. The British had their chance and blew it. Now
<br>
the U.S. has the chance as the sole remaining superpower to make the
<br>
world right, and it'll fuck it up as well. Just watch.
<br>
<p>BTW I do appreciate your essay. And I am hopeful, not just cynical.
<br>
<p>Thanks
<br>
