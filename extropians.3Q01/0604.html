Continued.. I would like to add something to my previous post
<br>
regarding definition(s) of 'spirituality' ...
<br>
<p>While reviewing some basic astrophysics concepts today, I re-read a
<br>
popular science article I liked very much, called: &quot;Recycling in the
<br>
Universe&quot; (Sky and Telescope, November 2000) by Alyssa Goodman, a
<br>
professor at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in
<br>
Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her article is about the 'recycling'
<br>
processes that occur in the interstellar medium.
<br>
<p>The photograph on the last page of the article ties together all of
<br>
the concepts that she describes in the text: it is a Hubble Space
<br>
Telescope image of NGC 3603 in Carina. In the photo, one sees
<br>
molecular clouds processing material, one sees the dark regions of
<br>
dust, one sees newly formed pre-main sequence stars with winds
<br>
ionizing the hydrogen gas, and one sees an old star ejecting its
<br>
outer envelope, so it now appears as a planetary nebula. My
<br>
emotional reaction to this photograph was: awe in the our
<br>
Universe's existence, as I described in my previous message, plus
<br>
the following:
<br>
<p>Whether our existence is a simulation, or a play of the tragedies
<br>
and comedies created by a larger intelligence, it doesn't matter
<br>
much to me: the processes that are part of our existence are
<br>
magnificent. Just as I have to respect every event in my life that
<br>
shaped my current existence, I respect every process that shaped the
<br>
existence of everything else, and I really feel honored that I was
<br>
asked (?) to participate in the unfolding of the Universe's events,
<br>
and that I'm a part of it all.
<br>
<p>When I saw that photograph, I *knew* that I was a part of that
<br>
magnificent scheme. I would call this one more aspect of my
<br>
'spirituality' because many of my small daily practices are simply
<br>
supporting and paying attention to &quot;what exists&quot; and appreciating
<br>
and respecting them for what they are.
<br>
<p>(Lee, does this help you to understand how some of us might
<br>
define spirituality?)
