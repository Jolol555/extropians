<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; The Tampa police are using three dozen security cameras
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; equipped with face-recognition software to search for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; criminal suspects among people in a downtown district.
</em><br>
<p>and I asked 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;But would one feel that one's privacy were invaded by actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;human detectives surveying crowds with binoculars?  They used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to, you know.  I recall reading about how in England one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;detective was so obsessed with the Great Train Robbery that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;he spent most of his free time watching crowds for his man.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Well yes actually. I don't know the instance you refer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I'll bet he got a load of grief if he was found out.
</em><br>
<p>An important issue in the whole &quot;Transparent Society&quot; debate
<br>
hinges around how people in truth actually feel.  My guess is
<br>
that you are wrong here; I know I wouldn't have been at all
<br>
bothered to know that the detective had been frequenting the
<br>
same beach that I did.  I'm eager to know if others agree with
<br>
Steve here or with me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Many people would object to the [some of the] hypothetical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case[s] you describe, after all this is what despotic regimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been up to for a long time and people objected to that.
</em><br>
<p>I think that what people objected to was the way that the
<br>
regimes used the information, and the actions that were taken
<br>
against people.  I have to concede one of your main points:
<br>
namely, that in the question as to how much governments can
<br>
be trusted, the burden of proof lies on those who say they can.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The increased efficiency simply makes it worse since it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes this kind of surveillance easier and cheaper,
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and so if governments tend to misuse it, I'll also
<br>
agree that this technology could easily make things worse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's interesting to speculate how people would react
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we did get a transparent society with effectively constant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surveillance, a kind of society wide panopticon.
</em><br>
<p>I liked David Brin's book &quot;The Transparent Society&quot; which
<br>
dealt very well with this whole issue.  It's very controversial
<br>
on Extropians as well as everywhere else, however.  Although
<br>
some very reputable thinkers believe that the government or
<br>
the rich will always have the upper hand---and this will just
<br>
make it worse---I was persuaded by Brin's arguments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps we'll all start behaving like the inhabitants of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Big Brother house :)
</em><br>
<p>I greatly enjoyed listening to Arthur C. Clark and Stephen Baxter's
<br>
&quot;The Light of Other Days&quot;, which picks up on an idea of Clark's
<br>
from Childhood's End:  a history machine is created that allows
<br>
universal surveillance not only of the present, but of all of 
<br>
history too.  Maybe it would be as bad as Big Brother (as an
<br>
Orwell fan, I sure hate this usurpation of the term), but I
<br>
don't think that I would act any differently if I knew that all
<br>
of posterity would have access to my life.
