<p><em>&gt; Molloy and Lorrey didn't discuss racism. And it really has little to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with uncomfortable ideas. If the discussion was about ways to solve the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem of racial inequality, noting that many of the poorest segments of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society are predominantly black, then yes it would have been something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people would have felt uncomfortable about, but discussion may have been a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heck of a lot more profitable.
</em><br>
<p>In what way would people have felt threatened by a discussion
<br>
about how to &quot;solve&quot; the problem of racial inequality.  Perhaps
<br>
you mean that some would be uncomfortable at the thought of
<br>
using government to do it?  Yes, I think you are right about that.
<br>
<p>I note your use of their last names.  Do I infer correctly that
<br>
if you agreed with them, you would refer to them differently?
<br>
If so, do you approve of the general principle of referring to
<br>
people differently based upon whether we agree with them or not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But some of the puke that Lorrey and Molloy came up with did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not amount to discussion and it is no wonder it was pounced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upon by many here.
</em><br>
<p>Puke?  Can you honestly defend the use of such language?  You
<br>
know, you are supporting the contention that many liberals
<br>
(or whatever they're called where you come from) really are
<br>
less capable of being fair and objective in discussion.  (I
<br>
have not seen enough evidence of that, but you are adding
<br>
to what evidence there is.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; First, do you know that &quot;plonked&quot; means that someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; has engaged an automatic process by which (roughly speaking)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a certain person's posts never even get to his mailbox?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If this isn't a frightened tactic of self-censorship, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I don't know what is.  (I hasten to add, that quite often
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; experienced discussion list members employ plonking not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; prevent their eyes from meeting disagreeable points of view,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but rather because someone's posts over a great deal of time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have shown themselves to be without content, or too long, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; some other non-partisan cause.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...yes, I understand &quot;plonk&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And no, it wasn't a &quot;frightened tactic&quot; at all. I found Lorrey's posts to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be of no use to me, and his aggressiveness was tainting my email 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience... I was almost coming to dread reading the list. Molloy didn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to have anything worthwhile either. This list is very active, and I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found this a way to bring it back within manageable size. Both are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely frequent posters, and I get about 100 emails a day (mostly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing &amp; VR lists) without the extropians list. As someone else here 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said: time is the most precious resource.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It took me a fair while for me to come to the decision to filter them out. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't want to lose the possibility of useful thoughts from someone who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was just having a bad day... or a bad week.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was considering starting a thread on plonking as I do consider it a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially dangerous thing to do. Being a tech nerd, I am very aware of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dangers of positive feedback loops.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry, but I don't entirely believe that you plonked
<br>
them because of the frequency of their posts, and the fact
<br>
that they had nothing &quot;worthwhile&quot; to say.  You can refute
<br>
me by saying how many other people you have plonked, oh,
<br>
say in the last year---*who were not ideological adversaries
<br>
of yours*!
<br>
<p>If you can say that during the last year there have been
<br>
quite a number---and it wasn't just because you disagreed
<br>
with them---then I will know that the size of your mailbox
<br>
and the quality of posts actually is the reason for your
<br>
plonking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Second, what that person said  &quot;I'm not racist. I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; help that blacks are stupid.&quot; is *not* necessarily absurd,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; as you claim.  It may be entirely wrong; it may be a gross
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; over-generalization; it may be so utterly an unqualified
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; assertion that it absolutely demands refutation---but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; not absurd.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh, come on Lee. You don't seriously think that, surely. :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of *course* it is absurd. The first statement, that he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not racist, is clearly contradicted by the second, a racist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement if ever there was one.
</em><br>
<p>Um, yes, I do.  It is possible that he isn't a racist, but
<br>
is extremely careless in qualifying his statements.  See my
<br>
other criticisms of his statement above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;As Jerry Mitchell has written,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;we must very precisely face square-on those assertions with which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;we disagree, if we are not to simply paper them over, and let
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;their inaccuracy fester.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jerry Mitchell doesn't make a lot of sense if you ask me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The words sound noble, that we face up to contrary opinions, but practical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considerations intrude. Endlessly debating racism as a potentially valid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewpoint every time it reared its ugly head might be OK if we were already 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immortal, but who has the time? You only need to show it is a mistake once 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then move on. Avoid wrestling with a pig -- the pig enjoys it and you get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; covered in mud.
</em><br>
<p>It sounds to me as if you underestimate the deepness of ideological
<br>
disagreements.  You cannot expect to &quot;show some view is a mistake&quot;
<br>
only once, as if it were an exercise in algebra.  Here, you also
<br>
equate some people, by metaphor, to pigs---I am certain that you
<br>
don't really mean that.  But the carelessness of your remarks (e.g.,
<br>
&quot;pig&quot; and &quot;puke&quot;) show that you have little worry about negative
<br>
emotions affecting your rational decisions and statements.
<br>
<p>Lee
