&lt;There are certainly senses in which that's true.  But there are also
<br>
senses in which that's ... beside the point.  If people can use viral
<br>
surgery to change their skin color (etc.) instead of cosmetics...then
<br>
the old basis of race disappears.  If genetic characteristics remain
<br>
fixed from the time of conception (or at least from birth) then I guess
<br>
that it continues relevant.  Or at least as relevant as tatoos, scars,
<br>
and other hard to change features. And cosmetic surgery can also be
<br>
expected to improve... or at least become more extensive in what it can
<br>
handle.  Just consider the possibilities inherent in self-cloned skin
<br>
grafts (i.e., skin grafts of pieces of skin whose DNA matches your own).&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the record...I am one of those people that can get called &quot;racist&quot;
<br>
if I don't passively lie about how I feel on this issue.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And in response to this statement... my feelings on the race issue have
<br>
very little to do with &quot;skin color&quot; per say. Race in general has almost
<br>
nothing
<br>
to do with skin color. It's just a &quot;marker&quot; or an advertisement for an
<br>
individual who (more often than not) belongs to a certain cultural group,
<br>
acts and thinks in certain ways.  Making skin color elective in the medical
<br>
sense will be a great boon towards merit-based &quot;racists&quot; like myself, as
<br>
it will flense much of the &quot;dead weight&quot; from our intellectual constituency.
<br>
It's not the &quot;skin color&quot; of certain types I object to associating with,
<br>
it's
<br>
the mindset, the willful ignorance and lack of mental flexability, the
<br>
victim mentality, the culture, music etc. Most of the newer generation of
<br>
&quot;racially aware&quot; types fall into this category.  Moreover making the
<br>
cosmetic truly optional makes it much easier to &quot;advertise&quot; one's
<br>
allegiance to certain memes.  I expect that this sort of technology
<br>
(assuming that the future doesn't make this entire discussion hilariously
<br>
irrelevant, which it just might!) will change racial awareness into
<br>
memetic awareness by another name. Which will be a good thing. IMHO.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put..it's not the skin color that's repulsive...it's the &quot;ghetto&quot;
<br>
(as
<br>
in ghetto the adjective!).
<br>
&lt;So it seems to me that as more features are subject to voluntary choice,
<br>
the concept of race will decline in importance, becoming more similar to
<br>
other voluntary social groupings.  (I.e., it is implicitly acknowledged
<br>
that if you press people hard enough, they will slide from one group to
<br>
another.)  I'm not totally convinced that this is good.  There may come
<br>
to be a strong pressure for everyone to slide into the same mold.  But
<br>
it's certainly a different problem than what current racism is.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;Trust me.. most racialists look forward to this. It achieves multiple
<br>
ends.. it lets people go where their hearts are. It lets those who
<br>
have certain aesthetic tastes (but lack those traits themselves) fix
<br>
matters appropriately, it takes away ammo for egalitarians who
<br>
are devoid of substantial thought. The more things about someone
<br>
that are subject to volition, the closer we get to TRUE meritocracy...
<br>
which is the point behind intelligent ethnic thought! Will be a very
<br>
good thing all around... assuming we still have bodies or a society
<br>
anything like today's in
<br>
50 years.
<br>
