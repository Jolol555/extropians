<p>Yes, alas. Robert is not an evil man, far from it, but this was vile.

<p>Yes, be assured of it.

<p>Thank reason for the sane comments by Anders, Ken, Carlos, Harvey and
<br>
others deploring this lapse and those like it. The only way I can deal with
<br>
this and stay subscribed to the list is to read such outbursts as evidence
<br>
of something akin to mentally unhinging post-traumatic stress. 
<br>
<p>I was appalled by the terrorist atrocities. But I am nearly in despair at
<br>
the responses of many people I expected so much better of.
