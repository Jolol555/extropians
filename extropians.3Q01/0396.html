<em>&gt;From: Eugene Leitl &lt;<a href="mailto:Eugene.Leitl@lrz.uni-muenchen.de?Subject=Re:%20TECH:%20Wireless%20gets%20real&In-Reply-To=&lt;200107061809.LAA16305@well.com&gt;">Eugene.Leitl@lrz.uni-muenchen.de</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;You might remember. We were talking about global connectivity for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everybody on this dirtball, then, suddenly, about affordable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;broadband, again for everybody, then, suddenly, about fiber, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everybody, then about a lot of other things, mostly unrelated.
</em><br>
<p>I remember.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Global connectivity for everybody (most values of everybody, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least) is doable, fiber up every tree is of course another matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entirely. But, who needs fiber up the wazoo, right now? I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take it, if I can have it, of course, but I'd be pretty happy with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anything above ~128/384 --availability and flat rate would be much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;preferable to speedy, but cranky connectivity.
</em><br>
<p>Still right with you, and I compliment you on your frugal use of
<br>
bandwidth, but most people want more, and how best to get it to
<br>
them is what we're discussing. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sure, that's the system you installed, and which works right now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;LoS photonics, swarms of mass-produced and mass-deployed low-LEO
</em><br>
<em>&gt;microsats, active beamforming, digital pulse radio, Ethernet to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the home, they're all different technologies, with different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capabilities and different pricetags.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, still with you all the way, and most of these systems have
<br>
overall price tags that price themselves out of the market for
<br>
general use.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Wireless is a huge area, most of it is yet uncharted. LoS
</em><br>
<em>&gt;photonics and digital pulse radio is wireless, and software radio
</em><br>
<em>&gt;routers are wireless, too. I'm not aware of any company having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;competencies in all of these areas, especially the lunatic fringe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technologies like digital pulse radio.
</em><br>
<p>I guess it's a matter of what you define as competency. We have
<br>
over 120,000 employees, many are hardcore techies with advanced
<br>
degrees and like me follow alot of this for fun as well as for
<br>
profit. Not counting consultants. 
<br>
<p>I was inspired by this thread to call my buddy Dr Mark Pecen, who
<br>
is co-developer of the EDGE wireless standard and has designed
<br>
digital radios. Among his current duties (he's with Motorola) he
<br>
advises washington policy makers on spectrum.
<br>
<p>We try to keep busy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Iridium is too expensive, of course. It deserved to crash and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;burn, but if the feds were willing to bail it out for their needs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;why not. Your taxes at work, and all.
</em><br>
<p>Actually if the bandwidth were higher and it were cheaper it would
<br>
fit your needs. ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, what if the end user devices themselves route packets?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Connectivity doesn't always require voice, SMS or a speech
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recognition system can send a small text message, which doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have to have high QoS. High-QoS 10 kBps might be the limit for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;streaming audio, but streaming audio is a  niche, albeit a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;currently very widely used niche.
</em><br>
<p>This is one of those things that works great on a very small scale.
<br>
(about 30 nodes or so) The problem with routing and routing
<br>
protocols is that they quickly eat up all available bandwidth and
<br>
processing power. Hierarchical organization is essential, wirespeed
<br>
routers help.
<br>
<p>Latency is a big issue with wireless routers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Have you heard about 802.11b and successor technologies grassroute
</em><br>
<em>&gt;networks, based on Mobile Mesh, etc? About communities doing their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;private Ethernet to the home projects?
</em><br>
<p>A number of the inhouse guys have wireless nodes in their homes,
<br>
and two that I know of have a link between them in the same
<br>
subdivision. We had a conference in house about 802.11b a few weeks
<br>
ago, and I wouldn't be surprised if there was a conversation going
<br>
on somewhere in this building right now about it.
<br>
<p>I like the idea of groups and communities getting together and
<br>
trying things out, more power to them.
<br>
<p>I'm one of the guys who gets the call to pick up the pieces... ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;At least 802.11b based networks are very affordable, even given
</em><br>
<em>&gt;early status of hardware development (I don't see why a mature
</em><br>
<em>&gt;802.11b derived router couldn't be sold for ~300-$400 in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quantities, with zero operaton costs but for the juice).
</em><br>
<p>It's an interesting development, and could be very usefull on a
<br>
small scale. Everything I've seen says the costs and problems grow
<br>
exponentially though.... :(
