<p>I don't see why this is.  Just because one of you has power over the
<br>
other, the power of life and death, does not inherently mean that you
<br>
have to come into conflict.
<br>
<p>There are many people in the world that you could kill now if you wanted.
<br>
Just buy a gun and you could shoot them.  You don't even need a gun if
<br>
it's a little kid.  Does this create an instant conflict between you
<br>
and everyone else?  It does not.  You would not exercise this power,
<br>
you would not wantonly kill.  Most people are good and moral and so we
<br>
do not live in a constant state of fear and conflict.
<br>
<p>In the same way, the computer self need not fear that the human self
<br>
will suddenly turn murderous.  And similarly, if the computer self
<br>
eventually came into power (say, it became rich by being able to run
<br>
super-fast and out-compete humans, and it could theoretically use its
<br>
wealth to hire assassins), the human need not fear the computer.
