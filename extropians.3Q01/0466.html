</em><br>
<em>&gt; to &quot;debunk&quot; religion with:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Because we won't move into a better future until we defeat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; religiosity, which is the most regressive force now operating in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         To me, religion is simply &quot;a way of life&quot; so everyone has one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mine happens to be extropianism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         But this is all probably just semantic differences.  To me all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theistic religions should definitely be &quot;debunked&quot;, fought against,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered evil and hopeless.  It's for the simple reason, that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is already a God (or any powerful ET out their hiding from us),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then what extropians want to do (eliminate all bad [or evil&gt;]) cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be done, even if we become as powerful as these Gods.  For if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't, or shouldn't, or don't help us overcome it faster/sooner we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't or shouldn't or won't help our children and others we find in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe the same way.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is a very strange line of reasoning.  That powerful SIs or
<br>
other types of Being, various Powers, are out there changes not
<br>
a thing about our own goals or our ability to transcend where we
<br>
are and for all we know continue to transcend.  There may or may
<br>
not be some endpoint of that process.  We simply can't know from
<br>
here.  That other Powers are there and have not done what we
<br>
think we wish to do (to the fuzzy level we grok it so far)
<br>
doesn't mean anything about what we can and cannot do.  Now, if
<br>
you think it all isn't worth it unless this bunch of
<br>
transcending intelligences controls every single bit of
<br>
Everything that is or will be, then you might have a problem.
<br>
But then again, you might discover these religious memes had a
<br>
lot of insight in what happens to *you* along the way to
<br>
becoming the Everything or the Intelligence behind it all. 
<br>
Maybe these other Powers are simply working out the consequences
<br>
for themselves.  Who knows?  The only way to find out is to go
<br>
forward and to go forward without believing we already know it
<br>
All.
<br>
<p>Who the heck says that Extropians even gorc what all &quot;bad&quot; or
<br>
&quot;evil' is much less that we can't be Extropians without
<br>
&quot;eliminating&quot; all of it?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         My definition of God is simply: That for which when it exists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there will be no more evils like isolation, suffering, dieing...  To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe there is already a &quot;God&quot; while there is still such evils
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be &quot;faith&quot; or &quot;hope&quot; but instead is the ultimate in giving up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in faithless despair.  For that means something like God is impotent,
</em><br>
<p><p>What makes you think all of this suffering is much more than the
<br>
adventures of developing intelligences within a VR and the
<br>
intelligences themselves are no more harmed by it than you are
<br>
by walking into something mind-numbingly brutal and even more
<br>
pointless like Quake or Everquest?  You assume a lot about what
<br>
a Power can or can't do from a point of view far different than
<br>
is likely when you get there.  Why should your conclusions be
<br>
believable from such a place?  Why should they bound what an
<br>
Extropian can or cannot believe and be an Extropian?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Only an atheist can have true faith an hope.  Believing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God is not only &quot;faithless&quot;, but it results in many other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentally evil beliefs and behaviors like hate and so on (as in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christians hate their devil, the people that crucified Christ...).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You cannot, thereby, both believe in God (or ETs or anything else that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is powerful and out there hiding from us) and be an extropian.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two are logically mutually exclusive.
</em><br>
<p>I have been an atheist.  I have been a theist.  I have been many
<br>
other things besides.  Hope is not a matter of what you believe
<br>
or do not believe about Powers.  It is a matter of what you
<br>
believe about possibilities and what you are willing to work on
<br>
making real.
<br>
<p>Your blanket statements about Christians are as pointless as the
<br>
rest of your blanket statements.
<br>
<p>I believe that a being very much like GOD will be and because of
<br>
what that Being is it is Now and always has been.  If this is
<br>
not so then such a being, a being many of us aspire to in many
<br>
respects, cannot be.  That is how I see it now.  
<br>
<p>Have fun.
