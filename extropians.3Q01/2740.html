<p>I strongly doubt it. We would need to:
<br>
<p>1) do everything in a secure environment so that failing control functions 
<br>
would not have a negative impact on the environment. We could also do it 
<br>
in a simulator, but that would involve a major slowdown of the simulation, 
<br>
and we're gonna have to simulate an astronomical number of generations in 
<br>
order to get results. (The more complex the behaviour you are trying to 
<br>
generate, the longer the evolutionary search strategy has to run.)
<br>
<p>2) Have a sophisticated enough fitness function that we can compare two 
<br>
different blobs of junk and determine which had come closest to building a 
<br>
cow. This will be extremely difficult to formulate, and will pretty much 
<br>
require us to have a working hypothesis of how to build the target in the 
<br>
first place. Thus, the fitness function is almost as hard to determine as 
<br>
the control software.
<br>
<p>3) Have a sophisticated enough monitoring system that we can actually 
<br>
apply the control function. This is only needed if we don't go the full 
<br>
simulation route. If we do need active monitoring, then it will, in itself 
<br>
constitute a system needing extremely complex control software.
<br>
<p>Writing a software system capable of deftly controlling a thousand real-
<br>
world machines to do a specific task is currently beyond our technology. 
<br>
We will need control systems for swarms of hundreds of billions of 
<br>
nanoprobes. I'm a big fan of alife and emergent technology, but I just 
<br>
don't see us getting there by that method. 
<br>
<p>Some of the research currently being done  on the design of emergent 
<br>
'intelligence' by mimicking the kind of swarm signalling that happens in a 
<br>
large termite hive *is* promising. (With millions of individuals, at least 
<br>
it approaches the correct scale of integration.) But until we've done 
<br>
enough work to know HOW the emergent behaviour in a hive emerges we have 
<br>
no guarantee that designing a swarm for a given task won't require strong 
<br>
AI.
<br>
<p>Note that I'm not saying that strong AI *is* a prerequisite, just that I 
<br>
would currently bet that it more likely to be a requirement than not.
