<em>&gt;In the 1970s there were some serious efforts made to create tests that

<p>&nbsp;The Bell Curve has pretty strong arguments that IQ tests impartially
<br>
measure something that is important in our society.
<br>
&nbsp;The Rising Curve (a book which is partly a response to The Bell Curve),
<br>
has some plausible claims that what IQ measures is something whose
<br>
importance varies from culture to culture.
<br>
&nbsp;Many cultures in Africa seem to have use a definition of intelligence that
<br>
emphasizes things such as slowness (i.e. deliberation) and respect for
<br>
society's ways.
<br>
&nbsp;Part of the explanation for the Flynn effect in our culture seems to be a
<br>
shift in achievement from things that the verbal part of the SAT measures
<br>
to things that IQ tests and the math part of the SAT measure. The Rising
<br>
Curve hypothesizes that this is due to increased availability of things
<br>
such as video games. I think they underestimate the importance of increased
<br>
rewards to professions that require analytical skills.

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;  It's a statistical fact that the mean for persons who identify as

<em>&gt;&gt; So here is the challenge: suppose we wish to design a college
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; admissions test that would *not* favor one subset of the above
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; any other.  The design constraints are as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 1.  The test must be performed in a single day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 2.  The test must not require a test administrator to assist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the test takers in any way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 3.  The test scoring must be completely objective, i.e, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; judges or subjective anything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 4.  The test must scorable by machine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Under these design constraints, what would the test
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; look like?  Would it not look a lot like the SAT?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If the blame for uneven scoring is put on differing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reading skills, is there in theory any way to design
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a legitimate test that does away with reading?  These
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are important questions, for Taxifornia is struggling to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; do away with the SAT, claiming that it unfairly favors
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a subgroup.  They have moved to replace it with a test
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that includes a foreign language.  This improves the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; scores of those who grow up hearing Spanish in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; home for instance, but further reduces the scores of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the poor scorers which have no foreign language skills.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; How can colleges legitimately measure and select the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; smartest?  Can they?  spike
