<p>Oh, okay, it is an antacid. I thought you were referring to something that

<p>Interesting idea. Wouldn't it be cool if things like this could be used. It

would be such a coup for the advertising industry, which has such a bad

name at the moment, to pull off something like this -- to be the saving 
<br>
force for millions in the third world! Imagine the friends and allies it 
<br>
would make in the third world. It might even undo some the public relations 
<br>
damage done by pharmaceutical companies' refusal to allow cheap anti-AIDS 
<br>
drugs to be sold in the third world.

<p>Nice conversing with you Anders, as always.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
