<p>Anyone who hasn't should go rent it. Good movie.

<p><em>&gt; How likely is it that a few mega-corporations will offer anybody free

</em><br>
<p>This only happens because of the government regulation that raise the cost
<br>
of entry for small companies to the point where it doesn't happen. Media and
<br>
telecommunications are an excellent example of this...there is no such thing
<br>
as a small media startup because the cost of complying with regulations is
<br>
beyond the resources of any company below a certain size. Additionally,
<br>
large companies create regulations through their bought political power to
<br>
hamper competition.
<br>
<p>All monopolies are unstable; in a completely unregulated environment (in
<br>
which large companies cannot create new regulations) any new, small company
<br>
can come along and offer a better product. It's easier for them to do this
<br>
than offer a completely new product in a new market, in fact.
<br>
<p>Look at the much less regulated computer and software industry. It's in a
<br>
constant state of flux with new companies, new products, new trends coming
<br>
and going all the time. Microsoft has been forced to drastically change
<br>
their basic business model several times in order to adapt; the fact that
<br>
they've retained their position of power for so long is testament to their
<br>
determination to do so by any and all means possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Capitalism is great as far as it goes, but it has that same failing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most other systems have: all the power ends up in a few hands.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those hands can be benevolent or malevolent. If anybody can tell me a way
</em><br>
out
<br>
<em>&gt; of that I am all ears.
</em><br>
<p>Someone earlier said that power ends up in the hands of those with control
<br>
of resources sooner or later in whatever system you're in. Very true. The
<br>
big advantage of capitalism over other forms of economic government is that
<br>
is doesn't attempt to get people to act in non-natural ways. Why fight the
<br>
tide? You want a form of government that works with the way in which groups
<br>
of people will act, otherwise you end up with a big mess on top of the
<br>
normal way in which people act. Communism as was practiced in the USSR for
<br>
example...the underlying real social interaction was all about accumulation
<br>
and exchange of resources.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;the more [societies] are under centralized control---the worse they are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, this is exactly my point.
</em><br>
<p>And the reason decentralized control is good is above: it's a very good way
<br>
(indeed, probably the only way with the computing power available now) to
<br>
flow with the desires and actions of the governed.
<br>
<p>Interesting thread we set off here. I'd say more, but the points have
<br>
already been made: all the faults of the currently capitalist systems can be
<br>
traced to regulation and interference by governments or individual human
<br>
stupidity and greed, capitalism does better than other systems tried to date
<br>
because in its ideal form it is decentralised and flows with the desires of
<br>
people rather than against them, consumer awareness and groups accomplish
<br>
great things if they're allowed to, etc, etc.
