<p>You run very little risk of being visited by the feds, and also very
<br>
little risk of giving the terrorists a notion they haven't discovered, but
<br>
I still say don't do it.  I still regret the time that I posted an easy
<br>
way for red goo to construct fusion weapons for no better reason than to
<br>
win an argument, but I doubt it had any effect on the course of history.
<br>
<p>My advice is to find someone who has a realistic chance of forwarding it
<br>
to the right people if you really did think of something new - a friend in
<br>
the military-industrial complex, that is - and forward on your suggestion
<br>
to him, and only him.  Unless it's something that we as individuals should
<br>
be taking precautions against, in which case by all means post it. 
<br>
(Anything that you can avoid by fleeing a major city counts as something
<br>
we should be taking precautions against.)
