Did anyone see this news on MSNBC.com about a new company offering to
<br>
copyright your DNA for $1500?
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/614414.asp?0dm=C19PB">http://www.msnbc.com/news/614414.asp?0dm=C19PB</a>
<br>
<p>I don't think DNA can be copyrighted, so this particular way to prevent
<br>
oneself from being cloned probably wouldn't work. The story also mentions
<br>
that US courts have ruled against turning someone into a parent without
<br>
his or her consent, so copyright protection isn't really necessary. But
<br>
this wouldn't prevent large-scale cloning of celebrities, since you
<br>
can create one illegal clone, get his consent, and then all subsequent
<br>
clones will be legal. (It does cause an 18-year delay though, or however
<br>
many years until the illegal clone reaches age of consent.) 
<br>
<p>I wonder if we might see anti-cloning technology that actually would work.
<br>
For example a genetically engineered self-destruct mechansism that causes
<br>
a cell's DNA to be wiped as soon as it is detached from the body. How
<br>
feasible would this be?
