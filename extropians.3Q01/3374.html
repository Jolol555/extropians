<em>&gt;From: &quot;Olga Bourlin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:fauxever@sprynet.com?Subject=Re:%20Vicious%20Racism&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108071607.JAA04422@well.com&gt;">fauxever@sprynet.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The way some people have chosen to describe &quot;racist&quot; on this list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is by calling &quot;racist&quot; those  people tending to be compassionate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and trying to figure out solutions to the problems still plaguing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us all as a result of legally-sanctioned racism of just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generation ago (e.g., the inimitable Mike Lorrey has written
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;[But] there are different types of racists as well. Those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think that someone needs to meet a lower standard just because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their skin color to get the same job or to be accepted into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;college, or someone who thinks that someone who is 7 generations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;separated from their enslaved ancestors deserves 'reparations', is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves a racist&quot;).   Ahem, not 7 generations ago, Mikey -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;granted, hundreds of years of &quot;enslaved ancestors&quot; came before 100
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years of de jure segregation, but the latter practice was alive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and kicking a tad over a generation ago.  Not to mention that de
</em><br>
<em>&gt;facto bigotry still exists.
</em><br>
<p>I think your mixing issues here, slavery and its end is a
<br>
completely different issue then as you put it &quot;de jure segregation&quot;
<br>
is.
<br>
<p>Therefore reparations and the need to address involuntary
<br>
segregation are seperate issues. What about voluntary segregation?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I realize that trying to get through to Mr. Lorrey is like trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to draw blood from a rock, but it occurred to me that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attempting to pose as &quot;colorblind,&quot; some people want to have it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;both ways.  If a person notices that our society is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;colorblind, well, that's &quot;racist,&quot; you see?   Even if our society
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(made up of individuals, many of whom are bigotted) were suddenly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to become &quot;colorblind&quot; overnight, that still wouldn't take care of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the sad legacy we've all been left with.  But the fact remains our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society (again, consisting of many bigotted individuals) is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;colorblind.&quot;  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people who have accused some of us on this list for being &quot;PC&quot; -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have designed their own libertarian[?] form of &quot;PC,&quot; those clever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rascals.  Cross it, and you-yourself are a &quot;racist,&quot; you see!  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I may make a CL observation, at this point: &quot;...how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conveeeeeee-nient.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>In the attempt to correct past and current issues about race,
<br>
otherwise well meaning individuals have created new ones as any
<br>
white male can tell you.
<br>
<p>Two wrongs don't make a right. ( but three lefts do. ;) )
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;So, certainly, if even so much as noticing that we have a &quot;race&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem makes us &quot;racist,&quot; then we're all &quot;racist.&quot;  But then that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;boils the word down to utter meaninglessness.  Dear me, what a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conundrum the Mikeys of the world have left for us poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bleeding-hearted knee-jerking types.  Be concerned about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem of &quot;racism&quot; in our country - what?  you say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you're not colorblind? - then you're a racist!   Express a desire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to help the underprivileged - what?  you say you're not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;colorblind?  then you must be a racist!
</em><br>
<p>There is current discrimination against white males, which we are
<br>
not going to ignore as we address these issues.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;Colorblind&quot; would work if our society were truly colorblind. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Racism&quot; would not need work if our society were not racist.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;until we are free of &quot;racism,&quot; we who are concerned about its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problems don't have the luxury of being &quot;colorblind.&quot;  And I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;submit that that's not &quot;racist,&quot; in the generally accepted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understanding of the word.
</em><br>
<p>One of the problems is that we have not agreed on what &quot;racism and
<br>
Racist&quot; mean on this list. There are for example those who claim it
<br>
has only to do with genetics.
