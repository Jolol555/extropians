<em>&gt; &gt; This definitely agrees with my personal experiences with such.  Now, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this diagnosis is correct, what is the best cure?  Education (but how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to get it into unwilling heads)?  Publically discrediting this belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system (but how to do so powerfully enough to pry it loose)?  Or is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there a more effective way?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think there is a single way. But some remedies might be:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * Discredit the self-interested groups. Since their positions are actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based to a large extent on their own gain rather than (say) a concern for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others, demonstrating this and the hollowness of their arguments can do a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of good. But this becomes much easier if the counter-arguments are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understandable.
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't this play into the dangerous meme that only those who
<br>
have no personal or group stake in a situation should have any
<br>
say in it?  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * For arguments to work, they must be understandable. Expressing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits of free trade, free movement of people, open societies and so on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a way that *anyone* can understand is a huge challenge that should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; met. Well crafted arguments may of course cut through a lot of rigid belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems, but they are hard to create. It is better to aim at &quot;the middle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ground&quot;, the large population of people not strongly polarized but not very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledgeable and get them to learn about these ideas. That can help create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a culture that can absorb more advanced arguments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Free trade and free movement are fine and good.  Being convicted
<br>
here for breaking a law passed by a government on the other side
<br>
of the world that I have no representation within and which
<br>
might run on totally different principles than any I have agreed
<br>
to is not at all fine.  Yet such things have been proposed as
<br>
part of &quot;globalization&quot;.   
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; * Aim at the intellectuals. As Hayek pointed out (I know Waldemar and I are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starting to sound like a broken record about this) in _The Intellectuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Socialism_, if you can get the memes into the intellectual strata of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society, they they will spread much more efficiently and affect other parts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of society. This requires a lot of dedicated work, but eventually it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be worth it (as socialism demonstrated).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>To be cynical, I think it was Lenin who was happy to have the
<br>
intellectuals make the space for the revolution but promplty
<br>
suggested they be done away with as soon thereafter as
<br>
possible.  Be very careful what it is you do and do not want
<br>
globalization to be.  Watch out for putting the neck of humanity
<br>
in a common noose.
