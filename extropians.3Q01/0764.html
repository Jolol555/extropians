<p>L.A. May Be Shot Down in Bid to Tax Satellites
<br>
By Dan Whitcomb
<br>
<p>LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Los Angeles officials seeking to impose property
<br>
taxes on space satellites were brought back down to Earth on Tuesday when
<br>
a state board moved toward declaring satellites beyond the reach of even
<br>
the tax collector.
<br>
<p>But Los Angeles County Assessor Rick Auerbach said he was not yet ready to
<br>
scrap the proposed tax and would consider a court challenge if he finds
<br>
that the California State Board of Equalization has circumvented state or
<br>
federal law.
<br>
<p>It was Auerbach who determined that eight communications satellites owned
<br>
by Hughes Electronics Corp.(NYSE:GMH - news) and currently in
<br>
geostationary orbit 22,300 miles over Earth's equator were taxable as
<br>
movable property that was currently out of state, similar to construction
<br>
equipment.
<br>
<p>That decision prompted county officials to consider an assessment on the
<br>
communications satellites, which are each worth up to $100 million new.
<br>
<p>But State Board of Equalization members appeared to short circuit that
<br>
plan on Tuesday when they voted 5-0 to ``fast track'' a rule that
<br>
satellites cannot be taxed, even though Hughes, a unit of GM (NYSE:GM -
<br>
news), is based in Los Angeles.
<br>
<p>The decision came after presentations by Hughes and Auerbach and directs
<br>
the board's staff to draft a rule declaring the satellites nontaxable.
<br>
Board members would vote on that proposed rule in the coming months.
<br>
<p>George Jamison, a Hughes vice president, said the firm was relieved and
<br>
pleased by what he called the ``good common sense'' of the board and said
<br>
they considered the proposed tax a very bad idea from the start.
<br>
<p>HUGHES: TAX IS 'LUDICROUS'
<br>
<p>``It's ludicrous, absolutely,'' Jamison said. ``It's the type of issue,
<br>
quite frankly, that causes the company to consider relocating its base of
<br>
operations to a more business-friendly environment.''
<br>
<p>The satellites are not launched from California, do not pass over
<br>
California while in orbit and will never return to the state, instead
<br>
becoming space junk, he said.
<br>
<p>``We think the ruling is important,'' Jamison said. ``These spacecraft are
<br>
not be in the state of California, have never been in the state of
<br>
California during their useful lives and will never be in the state of
<br>
California in the future.''
<br>
<p>Auerbach conceded that the board members ``have made up their mind already
<br>
that the property is not taxable,'' but said the issue was not necessarily
<br>
dead because he had researched the case and found legal opinions
<br>
supporting his position.
<br>
<p>``I'll have to see what basis they have for the rule,'' Auerbach said.
<br>
``If I believe it's improper (under the) U.S. Constitution and and state
<br>
statutes my option is to go to Superior Court.''
<br>
<p>``I have to keep an open mind,'' Auerbach said. ``Based on the opinions I
<br>
have I think it still looks taxable.''
<br>
<p>Auerbach insisted that he was not pushing for a tax on the satellites but
<br>
was simply doing his job and trying to determine whether they should be
<br>
taxed.
<br>
<p>``I'm neutral on the whole thing,'' he said. ``My job is to make sure all
<br>
property that's taxable gets assessed and I'm going to follow the law. If
<br>
the law says its not taxable it's not taxable. If it is taxable I will
<br>
assess it.''
