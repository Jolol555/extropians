<em>&gt; Here is a question that has bugged me off and on for years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What ways of handling property rights and especially land rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem most reasonable for people who value individual liberty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the well being of people in general?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This works fairly well for small items and stuff that involves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of labor.  But what about large tracts of land, mineral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights, etc.  If a small bit of land lays unclaimed and you claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, work it, build a home on it etc. it makes sense to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it becomes yours and stays yours as long as you do not forfeit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it by abusing your neighbors in some way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see why people get to claim large amounts of land unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they do something with it which gets most people in the area to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide not to contest their claim.  Obviously this can be done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with military force but that only last as long as the force lasts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Contracts and agreements can last longer because most everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs a good reputation to thrive in this world.
</em><br>
<p>This only matters if you don't regard conservation as a meaningful
<br>
economic activity, or if you have something against the particular
<br>
economic activity of a particular large landowner (i.e. logging,
<br>
recreation, mining, maple sugaring, mushroom gathering, grazing, haying,
<br>
etc.) Typically when I see people making arguments against big
<br>
landowning, it is because they don't regard one (or all) of these
<br>
activities that are typical of large landowners as a valid use, some of
<br>
which require the landowner to own large amounts of land to make it a
<br>
profitable economic activity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't want to speculate on this to much because it may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been worked out well by others but I would like to have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear conception in my mind.  I think this makes for an important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political issue.  Whose land rights do I see as valid and what sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of land rights ideas do I want to propagate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If governments can legitimately claim land rights they have a right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do a lot of other things too.  If the U.S.A. corporation or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; California corporation owns the lands they claim, they may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entitled to charge fees, percentages, etc. for passing through their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land.  I doubt they do because something does not seem right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I want to have a better understanding of these issues.
</em><br>
<p>Well, technically the US government cannot own land outside of the
<br>
District of Columbia. It can own buildings, but it is supposed to either
<br>
lease land from the states, or hold land in trust for the people. The
<br>
problem with this is that the 'trust' provisions have been abused
<br>
greatly of late (say, the entire 20th century) because the government
<br>
never winds up disbursing these trust lands to any 'people', so it has
<br>
changed from mere stewardship and management to de facto ownership,
<br>
contrary to the intent of the Constitution. What this has done is cause
<br>
a large segment of the population to live the equivalent of
<br>
sharecroppers or serf-like existences, never actually owning the land
<br>
they work. Thus, a feudal economic system has sprung up, primarily in
<br>
the western US, with the federal government as the lord, with a similar
<br>
relationship as a feudal lord to his serfs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suppose land rights can also be conceived as space rights or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more accurately spatial relationships rights.  Some segment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space is yours.  The space moves or rather you are always moving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but you move in relationship to everything (or almost everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else) which is also moving.  So how does one reasonably structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights to a particular volume of matter moving through space.  Land
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Earth moves through space in relationship to other land on earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of the time.
</em><br>
<p>Land rights evolve as a sort of 'land patent', giving the 'owner' an
<br>
exclusive monopoly on the use of the resources within the boundaries of
<br>
that land, which they typically must develop within a certain time frame
<br>
or else pay property taxes. Failure to do so results in the deed
<br>
'patent' devolving back to the state.
<br>
<p>Looking at things from a geological time frame is really rather
<br>
unreasonable. So far as I know no boundary disputes have arisen from
<br>
tectonic activity (beyond possibly dealing with lava and ash flows
<br>
disturbing boundary markers), although river and seacoast erosion does
<br>
have its own impact. So in this respect land doesn't move with respect
<br>
to other land. We are not a migratory people in the sense of nomadic
<br>
herders, so in that respect a shifting spatial rights concept really
<br>
doesn't fit well either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, there are rights to matter/energy, and rights to move things on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vectors.  Another way to think of it is, rights to occupy a volume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving through space.  The matter may be expanding along with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most other matter associated with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure the science of it is relevant but it may help to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of things more physically.  What I am after is political understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to guide ethics and persuade people.
</em><br>
<p>Well, one body cannot inhabit the same space as another body as a matter
<br>
of course. With the right to life being the most basic right, this
<br>
demands rights to air to live from moment to moment in a natural
<br>
environment in order to engage in economic activities to meet more
<br>
extended needs of living. If you do not confer an automatic right to
<br>
food and water, then you must confer any rights necessary to conduct
<br>
economic activities to allow the individual to acquire food and water,
<br>
etc. It follows that those who are not able to engage in these
<br>
activities have a right, then, to food and water, thus an ethical
<br>
mandate for individual altruism by those who are productive
<br>
economically. Because individual lives can take on a myriad of
<br>
possibilities, which cannot be easily reduced to neat equations,
<br>
altruism must remain determinable by the individual actor and not
<br>
mandated by some third party.
