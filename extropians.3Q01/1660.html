<em>&gt;I'll get it if you think it is a good'un.  Even though I have

<em>&gt;plenty of fiction reading at the moment.  Just bought the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;4th Harry Potter book, all 600 pages of it.  Delightful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;series that I heartily recommend :-)
</em><br>
<p>I haven't read Potter yet, but if you're into fantasy, I recommend Dunsany
<br>
and Beagle.  From the former, The _King of Elfland's Daughter_ and _The
<br>
Charwoman's Shadow_ are both great novels, with the first being the better
<br>
of the two.  From the latter, his novel _The Last Unicorn_ is a good place
<br>
to start, though I've yet to read a novel by him I did not like.  (Others by
<br>
Beagle I've read include _A Fine and Private Place_, _The Innkeeper's Song_,
<br>
and _Tamsin_ as well as his short story collection _Giant Bones and
<br>
Others_.)
<br>
<p>Later!
