Evening all,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I was fortunate to have the opportunity to
<br>
return home this holiday weekend to visit
<br>
family and friends and get a much need respite
<br>
from the Beltway.  While at home I had dinner
<br>
with some old friends of mine who are rather
<br>
rabid regionalists. Jeff and Becky are Southern
<br>
Leaguers and SCV, DCV respectively.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can usually count on excellent food and fine
<br>
conversation when visiting, however this visit was
<br>
especially interesting as the conversation turned
<br>
(naturally given J&amp;B) to politics, particularly Bush's
<br>
present immigration proposals. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the points Jefferson brought into the discussion
<br>
was the issue of third parties and the future that could
<br>
arise if something were to set off the powderkeg J&amp;B
<br>
see arising from the deep divide between rural and
<br>
Christian Conservative politics on one hand and the 
<br>
urban &quot;Beltway Bandit&quot;/bicoastal civilization on the other.
<br>
(Keep in mind these are gross stereotypes..I am just try
<br>
to tell a good story here). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I countered that essentially southern seccession hasn't
<br>
an ice cubes chance in hell of working (again) despite the
<br>
fond dreams of my sin-hating, gun-loving relations and friends.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff's responses were as follows and I would like commentary
<br>
from the West Coast, Canadian and British members of the list.
<br>
1. The Scottish National Party will likely grow from being the
<br>
Official Opposition in the (new) Scottish Parliament to
<br>
making a fair go at Scottish independance.
<br>
2. The Plaid Cymru (welsh nationalist) is agitating and also
<br>
growing in voice. They don't seem to love Westminster much
<br>
either.
<br>
&nbsp;Both of these are left-leaning nationalist parties (which seems
<br>
incredibly odd to my provincial southern mind). 
<br>
3. The quebecois can go at any time. Jeff seems to think it's
<br>
a when and not if . (comments?) (the quebecois are also
<br>
left-leaning correct?)
<br>
4. If this happens Canada will look dramatically different.
<br>
5. Western Canada and Ottowa have deep differences,
<br>
left vs. right in a very general sense.  Jeff suggests English
<br>
speaking Canada will likely not survive as a single state.
<br>
6. Alaska will likely be facing a different set of options
<br>
in this scenario. The Alaskan Independance Party
<br>
(which is neither left nor right as I understand it) presently
<br>
tallies 25% of the registered voters in some precints. They
<br>
have excellent grounds for an independance attempt. (Much
<br>
better in a realistic sense than the American South in my view.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Note none of these scenarios have the slightest trace of 
<br>
&quot;hate-mongering&quot; or &quot;archaic fantasy&quot; to them. Which is
<br>
why J&amp;B got me pondering. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The crucial &quot;if's&quot; here are..what sort of Quebec independance
<br>
is likely..and is WestCanada likely to stick around if the
<br>
Quebecois go?  If WestCan went what would Washington State
<br>
and Oregon's populace think?  Is a series of seccessions by
<br>
left-leaning regions Jeff's wishful thinking or a reasonable possibility?
<br>
I have always thought of regionalism as a &quot;right&quot; leaning conservative
<br>
phenomena...Aztlan and Dixie ...not Alaska, Quebec and Scotland.
<br>
<p>comments welcomed please.
<br>
Brian
