<p>
There are terrorists living in this country.
<br>
Many terrorists may belong to a particular culture or &quot;race&quot;.
<br>
The situation is similar to driving a car of the same type 
<br>
recently used by a bank robber in your community.
<br>
We do not want the bank robber to walk around unquestioned
<br>
and we do not want to hassle innocent people.
<br>
Here is a simple solution.
<br>
<p>Befriend the people you are suspicious of.  
<br>
Be nice to them.  Get to know them.  Invite them to dinner.
<br>
If you spend enough time befriending someone you will
<br>
eventually figure out if the are friend, foe, or neutral.
<br>
Sometimes you will find out that your suspicions were silly.
<br>
Other times you will find your suspicions reasonable but wrong.
<br>
Keep getting to know them until you feel comfortable or scared.
<br>
<p>If you find nothing to worry about you have made a friend
<br>
(or been bored for a few hours and made an acquaintance).
<br>
If you find more and more things that worry you, talk to other
<br>
friends and get other people to come and be friendly with the 
<br>
person.  If you are feeling wary be a little careful but stay
<br>
friendly and respectful.  If you are certain of guilt and feel at 
<br>
risk do what you need to do.
<br>
<p>If someone does not want to be friendly with you that does not
<br>
mean they are a terrorists, they may dislike you, they may be
<br>
a hermit.  Get other people to try.  If they don't want to be friends
<br>
with anyone you know and trust, then keep yours eyes on them
<br>
until you figure out whether or not they are dangerous.  The whole
<br>
time, be nice, friendly, respectful, etc.  It will not hurt you much to
<br>
be a little nice to a bad person (as long as you are careful).  You
<br>
will do no real harm to the hermit or jerk.  You will be doing 
<br>
a good thing for nice people who just happen to superficially
<br>
resemble people you fear.
<br>
<p>It is hard for terrorists to infiltrate a community.  It is easy for
<br>
terrorists to infiltrate a paranoid or insensitive society.
<br>
<p>Be especially nice to people from the Middle East for a while
<br>
they could infiltrate the enemy and they might be willing to if
<br>
people treat them respectfully and ask them nicely.
<br>
<p>If anyone has feedback or ideas for further refining or practicing
<br>
these concepts let me know.  Feel free to spread the idea or this
<br>
post around.  I think it is a good concept.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Will
