<em>&gt; &gt; Mike Lorrey:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Disobey Acton's Law at your own peril. Government is only interested
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; doing good for itself. If anyone else benefits, that is simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; serendipity, or a means to an end.
</em><br>
<p>Olga: &gt; &gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Let's see.  Government, not an amorphous being, but people = doing good
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves (with the result that sometimes other people [other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government employees] benefit).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; v.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No government.  Each man, woman and child left to fend for themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Serendipity for the genetic celebrities.  &quot;Collateral damage&quot; for
</em><br>
others.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Too bad.  That's life.  Ta ta.  Disobey Olinka's Law at your own peril.
</em><br>
<p>Mike:
<br>
<em>&gt; Olinka's Law?
</em><br>
<p>That's my pet Russian name.  Hehehe ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I, and many others think the second option is pluperfectly wonderful. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't automatically distrust other individuals (or themselves) who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not shielded by the mantle of the state from responsibility for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions. Collateral damage only exists for those who insist on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parasitizing on others without permission.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, dear, I was afraid you'd say something like that.  Even Ayn Rand was
<br>
afraid of anarchism because, she said (words to this effect) &quot;I can't trust
<br>
other people the way I trust myself.&quot;  Parasitizing, ouch!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It always seems to me that those who think the worst of others are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely projecting their own darkest fantasies about what 'they would do'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if free to act, automatically assuming not only that everyone else has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar fanatasies, but that they are similarly unable to restrain them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in virtue. They thus demand the authority and power to restrain others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when it is they who need the most restraining, especially once they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attain any power greater than the responsibility of the individual for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves.
</em><br>
<p>Ouch, ouch, ouch.
<br>
<p>Goodnight, sleep tight, and don't let the parasites bite ...
<br>
