The Longevity Meme news carried a pointer to a BBC article
<br>
that I followed back to the PNAS article (here):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/191313598v1">http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/191313598v1</a>
<br>
<p>Abstract:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We present genome-wide microarray expression analysis of 11,000 genes in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aging potentially mitotic tissue, the liver. This organ has a major impact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on health and homeostasis during aging. The effects of life- and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health-span-extending caloric restriction (CR) on gene expression among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; young and old mice and between long-term CR (LT-CR) and short-term CR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (ST-CR) were examined. This experimental design allowed us to accurately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinguish the effects of aging from those of CR on gene expression.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aging was accompanied by changes in gene expression associated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased inflammation, cellular stress, and fibrosis, and reduced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capacity for apoptosis, xenobiotic metabolism, normal cell-cycling,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and DNA replication. LT-CR and just 4 weeks of ST-CR reversed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of these changes. LT-CR produced in young mice a pattern of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gene expression that is a subset of the changes found in old LT-CR mice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is possible that the early changes in gene expression, which extend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into old age, are key to the life- and health-span-extending effects of CR.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Further, ST-CR substantially shifted the &quot;normo-aging&quot; genomic profile of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old control mice toward the &quot;slow-aging&quot; profile associated with LT-CR.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore, many of the genomic effects of CR are established rapidly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus, expression profiling should prove useful in quickly identifying CR-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mimetic drugs and treatments. 
</em><br>
<p>This is the 2nd significant publication fullfilling my prediction from
<br>
1997 that gene chips would have a huge impact on understanding what
<br>
aging really is.
<br>
<p>This is the first good evidence I'm aware of that short term CR has
<br>
positive effects by mimicing the changes caused by long term CR.
<br>
