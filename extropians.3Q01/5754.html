<p>Yes, there was an interesting column by one of the more moderate luddite
<br>
lefties in the newspaper the other day which proclaimed that web
<br>
browsing as an idle practice was crashing and that the internet was
<br>
becoming simply another appliance for people to go to the sites they
<br>
need information or to order products from. It is 'no longer' a medium
<br>
of exploration and learning. 
<br>
<p>I suppose this was not to be unexpected, considering how dismally many
<br>
search engines have fulfilled their mission of filtering out the 99% of
<br>
sites that are garbage, but it also goes to how significantly uncurious
<br>
the vast mass of humanity is. The species is becoming obsolete?
