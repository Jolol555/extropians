The story reported it as an 18 month level so I would take their word for
<br>
it until proven otherwise. No need for the interaction to be typed. The
<br>
person interacting could use voice recognition programming, but that is a
<br>
trivial point. If we take a dialogue between, let us say, 10 human
<br>
adults with 10 real human 18 month-olds and 10 human adults with &quot;Junior&quot;,
<br>
as we will call this R4P model, and type the 20 dialogues into an online
<br>
discussion, then we can do a Turing Test. The statisticians can evaluate
<br>
the results. That will give us the proof though I think we'll have to
<br>
spiff up the research design a little first.
<br>
<p>Sample Dialogue:
<br>
<p>POC: What Baby Junior wanna be when Junior grow up?
<br>
<p>Junior: Wanna be president.
<br>
<p>POC: Baby Junior sure?
<br>
<p>Junior: Sure as steppin on a texas cowplop in June, hombre.
<br>
<p>POC: Baby Junior have to go to school.
<br>
<p>Junior: What be school?
<br>
<p>The staff of Saturday Night Live will be the judges who will sort the
<br>
protocols into two piles, (1) rated as dialogue with R4P-Junior; (2) rated
<br>
as dialogue with a human 18 month old.
<br>
<p>R4P-Junior would go to robot school where robopsychologists would program
<br>
it, developmental step by developmental step up to adult levels of verbal
<br>
skill.

<em>&gt; No.  It would be pretty hard to even conduct that sort of test seeing as how
