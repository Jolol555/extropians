<em>&gt;From: &quot;Russell Blackford&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:RussellBlackford@bigpond.com?Subject=Re:%20Herding%20Extropycats&In-Reply-To=&lt;200109011231.f81CVkB27480@pheidippides.md.chalmers.se&gt;">RussellBlackford@bigpond.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Perhaps there is a sense in which none of this matters for the cause of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanism. However, I'd like to think that transhumanism can be linked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to other values that intellectually engaged and emotionally decent people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take seriously. I dread to think what impression is being created in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minds of any postgraduate students - the public intellectuals of tomorrow -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who might be poring over the list's archives trying to understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanism from a sociological or similar perspective. If they do come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a misconception that transhumanism is linked to inhumane attitudes, I'd say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they'd have some justification for it.
</em><br>
<p>I know what answer I would have given you five years ago or so. I've un-learnt
<br>
a lot since then, but you can take this old attitude as a fair representative
<br>
of what a lot of such postgraduate students in my country would probably
<br>
tell you after poring through the list archives: &quot;you are willing to ignore or
<br>
even build barriers around misery and suffering, letting the people there live
<br>
in their doom, all for your dream of Future... and that reeks of 'the end
<br>
justifies the means', and invalidates what you want to do in my eyes&quot;.
<br>
<p>As I said, I've changed my ideas a good deal since then. Your long-term goals
<br>
are awesome and worth pursuing, and I think there really is a good chance the
<br>
changes brought in would effectively do away with many of the issues that
<br>
have plagued mankind for so long. Right now my only objection would be (as I
<br>
said in another post) that people here seem to underestimate the power of
<br>
backlash, and you need to find ways to change a lot of mindsets out there,
<br>
before the angry and scared demands of the short-term goal seekers would
<br>
tramp all over you and your project.
