</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee, I'd like to know a little bit more about what you mean by the first 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paragraph before I answer that question. :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, there are some complex questions about whether it is possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be objective in giving an interpretation of a work of art. I think there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be a sense in which you can be, at least sometimes.
</em><br>
<p>It's possible for someone to be objective about a work of art
<br>
in only two possible ways:
<br>
<p>1. It can be claimed that the work has certain properties in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the value system of all the participants of a certain culture
<br>
<p>2. It can be claimed that the work has certain properties for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all normal human beings.
<br>
<p>Given that some of our aesthetics are genetic, even #2 has to
<br>
be correct (although any particular claim itself could be false,
<br>
of course).  I think that #1 is true, and not new.  It's objectively
<br>
true, for example, that Jerry Lewis is very funny in France, and
<br>
that in America rap lyrics are crude and stupid for most people.
<br>
<p>Does that seem right to you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, my answer to your question would almost certainly be &quot;no&quot;. Your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second para seems to make pretty clear that you don't reject the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aesthetic/cultural domain. My point wasn't about whether this domain is, in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some sense, a source of facts about &quot;objective truth and reality&quot;. It was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about whether this domain is *of value*. 
</em><br>
<p>I guess that everyone on this list agrees that, for them, all
<br>
the soft stuff has value.  I think that it's objectively true
<br>
that everything in the aesthetic/cultural domain has, or did
<br>
have, value to someone, or it wouldn't exist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Moreover, I've tried to bracket off, throughout this discussion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues of whether values are ultimately objective or subjective.
</em><br>
<p>That sounds like our best try, at present.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm happy to discuss such issues, but they didn't seem relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the point I was trying to make to Samantha. I was actually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to narrow the use of the term &quot;scientism&quot;, not broaden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to include people like you.
</em><br>
<p>:-)  Well, I don't use the term &quot;scientism&quot;, just as I don't use
<br>
the term &quot;spirituality&quot;, and I'm just trying to learn what people
<br>
mean by them, and whether they are useful for communication.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
