</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Solar power satellites could make a great energy source - if only it
<br>
were economical to deploy them.  Being able to get stuff into space
<br>
cheaply might make this possible.  It'd also open up a lot of
<br>
potentially cheaper material resources (asteroid/lunar mining), with
<br>
similar benefits.
<br>
<p>If things take a turn for the much worse, we could set up a refuge in
<br>
space with very little possibility of those who would hunt us down
<br>
being able to touch us once we are there.
<br>
<p>It has been theorized that low gravity may retard natural aging, or at
<br>
least make it easier to sustain life for hearts and lungs and similar
<br>
organs that have deteriorated due to age.
<br>
<p>That's just the ones I remember off the top of my head.  Anyone else
<br>
care to list more?
