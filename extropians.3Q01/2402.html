<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you mean by &quot;contravene&quot;?  He simply wrote papers and

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; produced a program to back up his papers on how broken the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; protection schemes are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Actually, it is not quite so simple.  Dmitry Sklyarov works for a Russian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is pretty simple. Adobe used broken (it's hard to call ROT13 even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broken) crypto in their product. Sklyarov (who apart from having a wife
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and two small children also seems to be a spammer, but that's also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrelevant for the case)  wrote a commercial package circumventing it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On Adobe's bidding using DMCA as legal background FBI arrested him after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his talk at Defcon where he presented his findings. He was not allowed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speak to his consul and was essentially held incommunicado. Which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty strong-arm intimidation in my book.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Geeks went postal, Adobe superficially caved in (but hasn't publicly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denounced DMCA, quite the opposite), Sklyarov is still held because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular legal machinery cannot be terminated once invoked. Of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Adobe's lawyers knew that in advance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So Adobe lost major brownie points far and wide in geekdom, DMCA is still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standing strong (put at least there's some political rustling around the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bushes), Dmitry is still in jail, security conferences outside of U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will become even more interesting (from what I hear Defcon was pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lame, anyway), and anonymous publishing packages (while still allowing nym
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prestige building) are receiving another major boost.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It will be interesting to see how cryptography/steganography will fare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against men with suits and guns. It's clear that while you can't link
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prestige accrued on a nym to meatspace, you can still publish papers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code without fear of being traced back (unless you're running software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from Redmond, of course).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am more paranoid.  How difficult would it be to infiltrate
<br>
many computer systems and find PGP keys and such?  Even if it
<br>
took breaking into a house to get the keys or plant software to
<br>
find and transmit them it is by no means certain my mail is
<br>
secure when I use PGP.  I have heard of programs that can detect
<br>
information patterns hidden in pictures and such and that these
<br>
are used by the FBI to note steganographic communications.
