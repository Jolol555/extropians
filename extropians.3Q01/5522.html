<em>&gt; &gt; No, but we are pretty good at calculating risk. I calculated that Bush

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hey, no picking on the Borg!  :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seriously, at least Gore had some small understanding of and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appreciation for the Internet and technology generally. 
</em><br>
<p>Emphasis on the 'small'. That is generally a plus in Gore's favor, but I
<br>
do have to recall that it was his wife that started the whole
<br>
entertainment censorship thing. He's no libertarian, by any means.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many of the Bush clan believe it is the instrument of Satan and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be severely controlled. 
</em><br>
<p>Maybe not satan, but certainly santa. ;)
<br>
<p>The saving grace is the things they want to control and the ways they
<br>
want to control them are generally issues where the Supreme Court is
<br>
pretty good about protecting individual rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Call me paranoid, but does it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strike anyone else as interesting that the combination of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legislation, enforcement, and the technology market being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slammed along with investment capital in general has precisely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the effect of slowing and curtailing the freedom and speed of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological innovation especially concerning the Net?  It also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slows down progress toward Singularity.  Does anyone think this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just might be on purpose, at least in part?
</em><br>
<p>I wonder what sort of insights you can draw of a person's motivations by
<br>
the sort of conspiracy theories they will buy into.
<br>
<p>I don't think the slowdown was caused as you fear, more a factor of
<br>
people suffering, again, from irrational exuberance overextending
<br>
themselves, combined with others unfamiliar with forging new terrain
<br>
economically putting the brakes on prematurely. We are all just feeling
<br>
around in the dark here.
