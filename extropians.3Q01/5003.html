Lee quoted Mark
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; I think you need to explain this a bit more. Relativists do not generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; deny that morality exists--indeed, if anything the complaint against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; relativists is that they allow for a superabundance of morality.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, this is what I called the New Age theory of morality in the previous
<br>
post.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thinkers that deny that morality exists. The Aussi philosopher J L Mackie
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; famously argued that all moral truths are false because there are no
</em><br>
moral
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; facts, i.e., morality does not exist. Mackie and other error theorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (Nietzsche is sometimes interpreted this way) do not say that moral
</em><br>
truths
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are relative to some social group, rather all such claims are false.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That sounds inconsistent to me.  In one sentence, Mackie allegedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;argues that there are no moral truths, and then in the next says that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they're false.
</em><br>
<p>No. What Mackie says is that moral *propositions*, such as &quot;X is morally
<br>
wrong&quot;, are false. He says that such propositions purport to ascribe ethical
<br>
moral properties, such as &quot;moral wrongness&quot; to things such as X in our
<br>
example. However, there are no such properties. Therefore, such statements
<br>
are false.
<br>
<p>A way out that would be more strictly subjectivist would be to say that &quot;X
<br>
is morally wrong&quot; is not a statement ascribing a moral property to X.
<br>
Rather, it *prescribes*  or *recommends* that we not do X. Or perhaps it
<br>
merely *expresses* our dislike of X or *reports* that dislike. There are
<br>
many such subjectivist theories. Mackie does not take this way out because
<br>
he thinks that ordinarily we do - and this is built into the language
<br>
itself - think we are ascribing moral properties, not merely making reports
<br>
or recommendations, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is uselessly confusing IMO.  Why not just avoid using the &quot;M&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;word, e.g., never say &quot;That's immoral!!&quot;, &quot;we much teach morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the school&quot;, etc.?  A quite unnecessary (to me, at least until
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you enlighten me) semantic quagmire opens up under us whenever we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;try to discuss the &quot;M&quot; word in the abstract, instead of much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;usefully attacking the things we dislike or think are harmful to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people, e.g., adultery, disloyalty, brutality, political correctness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;divisiveness, racism, diversity, separatism, zenophobia, etc.
</em><br>
<p><p>Why is &quot;diversity&quot; on this list? All things being equal, I *like* diversity.
<br>
It is an important value/commitment of mine, along with freedom,
<br>
benevolence, industriousness, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I have to go along with those who say that m******* is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relative, because that's closer to abandoning the term, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't allude to something in the universe that no one has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ever seen.
</em><br>
<p>This is one (though only one) of Mackie's arguments. Moral properties (or
<br>
entities or phenomena, such as &quot;goodness&quot;) just seem like such &quot;queer&quot;
<br>
(Mackie's word) metaphysical things.
<br>
<p>Cheers
<br>
<p>Russell
