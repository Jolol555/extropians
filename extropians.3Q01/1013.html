Ray Kurzweil has written a detailed response to Searle's arguments, which
<br>
will appear shortly in a book published by the Discovery Institute
<br>
(www.discovery.org) titled &quot;Are We Spiritual Machines: Ray Kurzweil versus
<br>
the critics of Strong AI.&quot;
<br>
<p>A few excerpts relevant to David Weinberger's article in Darwin magazine:
<br>
<p>Searle's Chinese Room Argument Can Be Applied to the Human Brain Itself.
<br>
Although it is clearly not his intent, Searle's own argument implies that
<br>
the human brain has no understanding.  He writes:
<br>
<p>&quot;The computer ... succeeds by manipulating formal symbols. The symbols
<br>
themselves are quite meaningless: they have only the meaning we have
<br>
attached to them. The computer knows nothing of this, it just shuffles the
<br>
symbols.&quot;
<br>
<p>Searle acknowledges that biological neurons are machines, so if we simply
<br>
substitute the phrase  &quot;human brain&quot; for  &quot;computer&quot; and  &quot;neurotransmitter
<br>
concentrations and related mechanisms&quot; for &quot;formal symbols,&quot; we get:
<br>
<p>&quot;The [human brain] ... succeeds by manipulating [neurotransmitter
<br>
concentrations and related mechanisms]. The [neurotransmitter concentrations
<br>
and related mechanisms] themselves are quite meaningless: they have only the
<br>
meaning we have attached to them. The [human brain] knows nothing of this,
<br>
it just shuffles the [neurotransmitter concentrations and related
<br>
mechanisms]. &quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, neurotransmitter concentrations and other neural details (e.g.,
<br>
interneuronal connection patterns) have no meaning in and of themselves. The
<br>
meaning and understanding that emerges in the human brain is exactly that:
<br>
an emergent property of its complex patterns of activity.  The same is true
<br>
for machines.  Although the &quot;shuffling symbols&quot; do not have meaning in and
<br>
of themselves, the emergent patterns have the same potential role in
<br>
nonbiological systems as they do in biological systems such as the brain. As
<br>
Hans Moravec has written, &quot;Searle is looking for understanding in the wrong
<br>
places ... [he] seemingly cannot accept that real meaning can exist in mere
<br>
patterns.&quot; ...
<br>
<p>[Searle's] descriptions illustrate a failure to understand the essence of
<br>
either brain processes or the nonbiological processes that could replicate
<br>
them.... While the man [in the Chinese room] may not see it, the
<br>
understanding is distributed across the entire pattern of the program itself
<br>
and the billions of notes he would have to make to follow the program.  I
<br>
understand English, but none of my neurons do.  My understanding is
<br>
represented in vast patterns of neurotransmitter strengths, synaptic clefts,
<br>
and interneuronal connections.  Searle appears not to understand the
<br>
significance of distributed patterns of information and their emergent
<br>
properties.
<br>
<p>Searle writes that I confuse a simulation with a recreation of the real
<br>
thing.  What my book (and chapter in this book) actually talk about is a
<br>
third category: functionally equivalent recreation. I am not talking about a
<br>
mere &quot;simulation&quot; of the human brain as Searle construes it, but rather
<br>
functionally equivalent recreations of its causal powers.  As I pointed out,
<br>
we already have functionally equivalent replacements of portions of the
<br>
brain to overcome such disabilities as deafness and Parkinson's disease....
<br>
<p>We have already created detailed replications of substantial neuron
<br>
clusters.  These replications (not to be confused with the simplified
<br>
mathematical models used in many contemporary  &quot;neural nets&quot;) recreate the
<br>
highly parallel analog-digital functions of these neuron clusters, and such
<br>
efforts are also scaling up exponentially.  This has nothing to do with
<br>
manipulating symbols, but is a detailed and realistic recreation of what
<br>
Searle refers to as the  &quot;causal powers&quot; of neuron clusters.  Human neurons
<br>
and neuron clusters are certainly complicated, but their complexity is not
<br>
beyond our ability to understand and recreate using other mediums.… The pace
<br>
of brain reverse engineering is only slightly behind the availability of the
<br>
brain scanning and neuron structure information.... There are many
<br>
contemporary examples, but I will cite just one, which is a comprehensive
<br>
model of a significant portion of the human auditory processing system that
<br>
Lloyd Watts (www.lloydwatts.com) has developed from both neurobiology
<br>
studies of specific neuron types and brain interneuronal connection
<br>
information....
<br>
<p>Virtual personalities can claim to be conscious today, but such claims are
<br>
not convincing.  They lack the subtle and profound behavior that would make
<br>
such claims compelling.  But the claims of nonbiological entities some
<br>
decades from now -- entities that are based on the detailed design of human
<br>
thinking -- will not be so easily dismissed....
<br>
<p>Inevitably, Searle comes back to a criticism of &quot;symbolic&quot; computing: that
<br>
orderly sequential symbolic processes cannot recreate true thinking.  I
<br>
think that's true. But that's not the only way to build machines, or
<br>
computers.  So-called computers (and part of the problem is the word
<br>
&quot;computer&quot; because machines can do more than &quot;compute&quot;) are not limited to
<br>
symbolic processing.  Nonbiological entities can also use the emergent
<br>
self-organizing paradigm, and indeed that will be one great trend over the
<br>
next couple of decades, a trend well under way.
