<p>
Does anyone know about this?
<br>
<p>&quot;Under proposed legislation, the US Postal Service will be attempting to
<br>
bill  E-mail users out of &quot;alternative postage fees&quot;.  Bill 602P will
<br>
permit the Federal Government to charge a 5-cent surcharge  on  every
<br>
e-mail delivered, by billing Internet Service Providers at source.  The
<br>
consumer would then be billed in turn by the ISP.  
<br>
<p>&quot;Washington DC lawyer Richard Stepp is working without pay to prevent this
<br>
legislation from becoming law. The US Postal Service is claiming lost
<br>
revenue, due to the proliferation of E-mail, is costing nearly
<br>
$230,000,000  in revenue per year. You may have noticed their recent ad
<br>
campaign:  &quot;There is  nothing like a letter.&quot;  Since the average person
<br>
received about 10 pieces of E-mail per day in  1998,  the cost of the
<br>
typical individual would be an additional 50 cents a day  - or  over $180
<br>
per year - above and beyond their regular Internet costs.  Note that this
<br>
would be money paid directly to the US Postal Service for a  service they
<br>
do not even provide.  The whole point of the Internet is democracy and
<br>
non-interference. You  are  already paying an exorbitant price for snail
<br>
mail because of bureaucratic  inefficiency. It currently takes up to 6 days
<br>
for a letter to be  delivered  from coast to coast. If the US Postal
<br>
Service is  allowed to tinker with E-mail, it will mark the end of the
<br>
&quot;free&quot;  Internet in  the United States.  Congressional representative, Tony
<br>
Schnell (R) has even suggested a  &quot;$20-$40  per month surcharge on all
<br>
Internet service&quot; above and beyond the  governments  proposed E-mail
<br>
charges. Note that most of the major newspapers have  ignored  the story
<br>
the only exception being the Washingtonian which called the  idea of
<br>
E-mail surcharge &quot;a useful concept who's time has come&quot; (March 6th, 1999
<br>
Editorial). Do not sit by and watch your freedom erode away!  Send this
<br>
E-mail to EVERYONE on your list, and tell all your friends and  relatives
<br>
to write their congressional representative and say &quot;NO&quot; to  Bill  602P.
<br>
It will only take a few moments of your time and could very well be
<br>
instrumental in killing a bill we do not want.&quot;
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Natasha
