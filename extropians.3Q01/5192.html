<p>Sure, but demonstration of first transistor action in buckys is just a few

months old.

<p>We always knew that the isolated switches alone would be no good. We have

self assembly and manipulative proximal probe as strong suggestions so

far. In fact, IBM is doing very good work on manipulative proximal probe,

so this is not just an isolated progress blipi.

<p>Hmm, while I don't have the print issue what I've seen so far looked like
<br>
a bland rehashing of well known facts. Given their well documented
<br>
negative bias towards nanotechnology SciAm is hardly a good source of

information.
