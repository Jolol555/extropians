People reading Damien Broderick and Charles Hixson might come away
<br>
believing that I am a supporter of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.
<br>
<p>Here is the second paragraph about it, sent Mon 8/6/2001 6:46 PM,
<br>
that I wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; But the possibility has been overblown, in my opinion.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; high point of this view occurred in the 1950's.  Since then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the counter-reaction has been that we are not so much damaged
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or affected by our terminology as had been thought.  All
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; human languages, for example, are almost equally effective in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; connoting, with some interesting exceptions.  But they're no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; longer regarded as all powerful in shaping our thoughts.
</em><br>
<p>I have been enlightened by those who point out that the Sapir-Whorf
<br>
hypthesis should be considered to have a &quot;strong&quot; form and a
<br>
&quot;weak&quot; form, and made other remarks.

<em>&gt; &gt; Are you familiar with the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis?  There is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some truth, here, I believe, that our terminology can indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; affect our intuitions, feelings, and thoughts in ways that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can be detrimental.  Yes, I can imagine that relentless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; labeling of those who disagree with one as &quot;enemies&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;opponents&quot; could grow to have this effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To my mind the central truth of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is easily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrated.  Certain computer languages make certain kinds of program 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easy to write, and other kinds of program quite difficult.  Even while 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all of these languages are formally complete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The projects that one would tackle in ML are not the same as the ones 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one would tackle in Fortran.  Or C.  Or C++.  Or Ada.  Or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Smalltalk.  These are all different.  There is no technical reason why 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any particular project could not be done in any of them (e.g., most of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them and be made to emit C code, or can use C as one step of their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compilation process).  But the difficulty of a project can vary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radically from language to language.  And the variation is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systematically different for different kinds of project.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the hypothesis is testably true (and perhaps it should now be called 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a theory).  Assessing the degree to which (and areas on which) different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human languages have this effect is, however, much more difficult.
