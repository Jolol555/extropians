<p><p>If balance has everything to do with getting knocked on your ass, then why
<br>
do you need bullets at all?  Balance does matter, but it is an issue
<br>
independent of bullets; one has to assume that the meager amount of energy
<br>
delivered by pistol bullets is insufficient to make a person lose balance.
<br>
<p>We are talking about 300-400 ft-lbs of energy here.  The only reason bullets
<br>
in this energy range work at all is because they focus all the energy behind
<br>
a very small cross section -- a mechanical ice pick.  Many sporting
<br>
activities routinely deliver far more energy to the human body.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Why does a punch to the sternum knock the victim on his ass but not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person throwing the punch?
</em><br>
<p><p>Losing your balance is not the same thing as being knocked on your ass.  Are
<br>
you saying that if I fired a 9mm pistol, with the butt placed firmly on my
<br>
sternum, that it would knock me on my ass?  I don't think so, no matter how
<br>
I'm standing.
<br>
<p>In Army basic training, the Drill Sergeants frequently demonstrate the lack
<br>
of recoil of the M16 rifle (1,200 ft-lbs) to the new recruits by placing the
<br>
butt of the rifle on their gonads when they shoot it.  I guarantee that they
<br>
would *not* want you to punch them in the gonads.
<br>
<p>Part of the problem is that you are confusing energy with power.  A punch
<br>
doesn't have a lot of power but it does have lots of energy.  A pistol
<br>
bullet has a moderate amount of power, but minimal energy.  Energy is what
<br>
knocks you on your ass, power is how its delivered.
