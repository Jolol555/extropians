<p><em>&gt;&gt; I think it's a serious social problem that many citizens quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; literally have nothing &quot;invested&quot; in this country.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I'd agree with this; it's back to basic human psychology again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;People don't care about something unless they built it or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something that they own or value is at stake. S'why council flats
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and communal property are such a horrible failure in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maintenance and responsibility.
</em><br>
<p>Big city housing projects are a prime example of this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Not a new idea; Heinlein advocated creating this citizen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;investment through military and government service. I think I like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the money idea more; it scales better to larger populations.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was probably the biggest reason I joined the
<br>
Marine Corp, and I've been saying TANSTAAFL ever since I read &quot;The
<br>
Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot;. Guess you could say I come from a good
<br>
background. ;) 
<br>
<p>The money thing seems like a good fit for America, we could all pay
<br>
something toward basic things like education and such, but parents
<br>
would pay more depending on how many children they have. That way
<br>
you're not telling people what to do, but they do have to literally
<br>
pay for their own decisions. Seems like a more equitable solution
<br>
to me, but I'm open to suggestions/ideas.
<br>
<p>There might be a way to rig the health insurance thing here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Anyone read that Spinrad novel about the Blue and Pink War? It has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a very interesting democratic model, as well as some thoughts on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how democracies get destablized by the media and mass stupidity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Specifically of interest was the concept of a government actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;breaking up monopolies by providing seed money to 'govcorps' to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compete in given spaces -- i.e. basically acting as a VC.
</em><br>
<p>Gonna have to look it up, check out that &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;
<br>
paper I mentioned.... (www.dieoff.org/page95.htm)
