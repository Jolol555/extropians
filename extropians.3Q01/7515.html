</em><br>
<p>The bullet would create a hole that would be spread open like a peeled
<br>
spam can for at least a foot or two by the pressure differential. Anyone
<br>
within 6-10 feet who was not belted down would get sucked out (depending
<br>
on altitude, of course). It would not cause the entire plane to explode
<br>
or go down, and the danger would cease once pressure equalized. Many
<br>
airliners that have suffered from decompression have safely landed.
<br>
<p>So, while some innocent people might die as a result, most passengers
<br>
would likely survive.
<br>
<p>I think that this is a far better scenario than to just write off a
<br>
planeload of unarmed people who got hijacked....
