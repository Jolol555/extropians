<em>&gt; &gt; I claim that only the very reflective have any chance in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; others stems from actual injustice, or merely from envy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that envy will always arise towards those considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more capable than oneself under economic and sociological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems based primarily upon scarcity models.  In such systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the premise is that there is not enough to go around so the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able or in some sense best should get the most first, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaving too little for oneself.
</em><br>
<p>Scarcity is a sufficient condition for envy, but, I think
<br>
hardly necessary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As we come into increasing abundance the basis for envy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should decrease if and only if our social, economic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even psychological systems adjust accordingly.
</em><br>
<p>If you mean eventually providing people with the means to
<br>
re-engineer themselves to suppress the kinds of envy that
<br>
they're not fond of, only then do I agree.  But otherwise,
<br>
I don't know what you mean by such an &quot;adjustment&quot;.
<br>
<p>Also, I suspect that you are here projecting your own healthy
<br>
motives and psychological disposition.  Do you know that a
<br>
huge number of people are so motivated by envy that it wouldn't
<br>
matter how rich they were so long as someone else was vastly
<br>
richer---and even more annoying---famous?  You should try
<br>
talking to some of them some time; their hatred of the rich
<br>
and powerful far exceeds any concerns they have for the
<br>
poor, and far exceeds any actual deprivement anyone has.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we truly want to reduce envy and simultaneously get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more of the people behind full progress then we need imho
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to find ways of sharing the increased wealth that are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective.  
</em><br>
<p>For sure; ever since Engines of Creation, at least, only a
<br>
few die-hard followers of the old model have been upset by
<br>
the idea of free food, clothing, and shelter for everyone
<br>
once it becomes cheap enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do not believe that the market economy by itself is doing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently.
</em><br>
<p>Do you mean to imply that some re-distributive scheme could
<br>
have been better applied in recent decades?  If not, you're
<br>
certainly making it sound that way.  It definitely sounds
<br>
as though you have a better idea, at least for the future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At the bottom end it is far too easy to fall into economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destitution in the US today.  There are too many people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working two or more jobs under poor conditions just to manage to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive at all for me to believe that the market alone leads to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the good life.
</em><br>
<p>I'd agree that &quot;the good life&quot; cannot flow from just the
<br>
market.  But I dispute that in the United States one even
<br>
needs to work at all in order to survive.  Provided that
<br>
you are willing to be institutionalized, or live in the
<br>
streets, one hardly *needs* to do anything at all.  (Of 
<br>
course, few people would have the psychological stamina
<br>
to go all the way, and refuse all the inducements to at
<br>
least help out, or work a little---but thousands of people
<br>
each year manage to do it.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Too many people that do have better lives are have more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debt than savings and are only a few paychecks from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bankruptcy and perhaps homelessness.
</em><br>
<p>In every case, this is due to a lack of education---specifically
<br>
the memes of thrift, prudence, and determination.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Upstream their are too many of even the technologically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elite who have no life but their work, not only or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principally because of their love of the work, but due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the shape of the economy and the conditions of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unemployment within it.  Something is out of kilter.  
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps their psychology.
<br>
<p>(But as I said at the outset, it'll be just great when those
<br>
of us who don't want to  don't have to work  to get goods and
<br>
services.)
