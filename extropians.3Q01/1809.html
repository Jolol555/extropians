<em>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:CurtAdams@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20privatization%20in%20the%20third%20world%20(was%20NEWS:%20Genoa%20riots)&In-Reply-To=&lt;200107222022.f6MKMbB22121@pheidippides.md.chalmers.se&gt;">CurtAdams@aol.com</a>

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This kind of thing has come up in several recent &quot;privatizing&quot; countries,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;OTTOMH, Russia, Peru, and Argentina.  Something is wrong, or incomplete,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about the privatization procedure.  Corruption requires discretionary power
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the part of the government; no power, no corruption.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Privatization should reduce corruption, by reducing what's there to corrupt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the fact that it doesn't indicates the IMF isn't privatizing the right things.
</em><br>
<p>Corruption in the privatized companies, now in the hands of private capitals,
<br>
has certainly been reduced a lot. The privatization process itself was
<br>
what gave the Menem administration a golden opportunity to get huge bribes,
<br>
benefit their friends with monopolistic contracts, and divert a good share
<br>
of the funds obtained by the privatizations to their own pockets (or to
<br>
political election-year-projects, wasting tons of money in ensuring their
<br>
re-election to office). IMHO, the IMF's mistake was their incredible
<br>
naivete in thinking these guys would carry on a clean and sensible
<br>
transfer process. On top of the utterly tainted nature of the process,
<br>
you have to add also the incompetence with which some of the contracts
<br>
were granted, as witnessed by the banruptcy, closure and/or dismantling
<br>
of some of the companies sold.
<br>
