<p>
So I'm trying to write some back-to-basics introductions to life extension
<br>
and tidy up/revamp/tighten the front page to the Longevity Meme
<br>
(<a href="http://www.longevitymeme.org">http://www.longevitymeme.org</a>). 50% of the traffic sees it and then goes
<br>
somewhere else. Which is actually pretty good, all things considered, but I
<br>
don't blame them for leaving. Given the rate at which I'm working on this
<br>
(more slowly than I'd like), I need to put something better in place as a
<br>
longer term temporary front page.
<br>
<p>So I run around a lot and look at places like www.fairtax.org (very good),
<br>
www.eff.org (I think mine is better as-is), and other nonprofit online
<br>
presences. I tap my keyboard and ponder. Then I remember that there have to
<br>
be half a hundred web designers and otherwise highly opinionated people on
<br>
the extropy list...
<br>
<p>So a helping hand or fifty would be appreciated here; a trivial yet useful
<br>
topic to give voice to. What can I do with this front page and the current
<br>
contents of the site to make it all obvious, enticing, non-intimidating to
<br>
the uninitiated and otherwise all things to all people?
<br>
<p>[Since I last mentioned it here, I have more articles
<br>
(<a href="http://www.longevitymeme.org/articles/">http://www.longevitymeme.org/articles/</a>), an ongoing slash-ish news section
<br>
in beta (<a href="http://www.longevitymeme.org/news/">http://www.longevitymeme.org/news/</a>) and a bunch of other additions.
<br>
One foot in front of the other gets you places eventually].
