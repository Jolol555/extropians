<p>&nbsp;&lt;&lt;There are escalating issues and competing forces today which threaten to

severely blunt our goals, thereby

rendering us helpless to stop even greater threats than those which most
<br>
people think about. ... My goal in surviving isn't to survive another day,
<br>
but to win
<br>
the game.  Destroying terrorism isn't a win, but merely a draw; spending
<br>
effort doing so in no way ensures my long-term survival and may indeed
<br>
hamper it. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It might be useful to look more closely at how the &quot;war against terrorism&quot;
<br>
could hamper the goal of long-term survival, winning the game. At the very
<br>
least, it will divert resources from more productive activities. At the
<br>
worst, it could result in a more restrictive government where much of the
<br>
technology that could lead to long-term survival is forbidden.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure there's much a few individuals can do to alter the course of
<br>
the US government in a positive direction. It's true that a small group of
<br>
terrorists appear to have had a huge impact, but please note that the bulk
<br>
of the economic woes stem from choices made by people other than the
<br>
terrorists. It is not the terrorists who have crippled the aviation industry
<br>
and driven down the stock market. I'm doing my bit to help stabilize the
<br>
economy: I bought stock this past week, and I intend to take a trip by
<br>
commercial airliner later this month. Beyond that, however, I can't think of
<br>
anything I can do other than speak out at every opportunity.
<br>
<p>But there is plenty I can do with respect to my own life.

<p>&lt;&lt;It is therefore imperative that energy be devoted to actual
<br>
solving the problems that we can solve rather than pissing in the wind over
<br>
short-term issues that are largely beyond our control.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I would have thought this obvious, but from the way people are talking and
<br>
acting, I guess it's not. It can seem difficult to distinguish the problems
<br>
we can solve from the ones we can't unless we think things through, starting
<br>
at a very basic level.
<br>
<p>James wrote (in two separate posts)
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Even if we can solve some problems it doesn't mean doing so is an
<br>
effective
<br>
use of effort and resources given a particular set of goals and a very
<br>
finite quantity of time.
<br>
<p>Resources are not infinite and people have to choose
<br>
their battles.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>This is another point that should be obvious, but people sometimes act as
<br>
though they've forgotten. Contrary to certain New Age beliefs, it's not
<br>
possible to &quot;have it all.&quot;   Setting goals alone is not enough. They must be
<br>
prioritized. There is a prerequisite condition to prioritizing goals: one
<br>
must have a clear idea of one's values. This is why certain types of
<br>
philosophical discussion (with others or even in one's own mind) are not
<br>
only useful but are necessary if one wishes to attain long-term survival.

<p>&lt;&lt;My continued survival is my first and foremost goal.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>This seems like an excellent starting point. The next question is: what is
<br>
required for continued survival. More on this question later, under
<br>
PRACTICAL: Time Management thread.

<p>&lt;&lt;  Any immediate,

high-probability, short time span threat should be neutralized or minimized,

but not necessarily at the expense of even higher probability threats that

operate over longer time spans.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It may be more useful to look at this from the other direction: which
<br>
courses of action best promote the achievement of long-term survival? To
<br>
define something as a threat limits the scope of the solution set.
<br>
Occasionally, that which initially appears to be a problem or a threat can
<br>
be dealt with in such a way as to become an asset. As an example (although
<br>
one I don't admire) consider how the 9-11 attacks are currently being used
<br>
for political gain.

<p>&lt;&lt;My last and most important point is that extropians are in the business of

creating the ultimate trump cards, technologies that can permanently render

the threats we are facing obsolete.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Could you expand this thought, James? What technology could render the
<br>
threat of terrorists obsolete? What comes immediately to mind for me are
<br>
such things as a more dispersed population with people coming together only
<br>
when they have a reason to be together rather than crowding together in
<br>
cities simply because that's the way things have been done for centuries.
<br>
Decentralized power generation. A shift from large, centralized governmental
<br>
and corporate entities to smaller ones with a less hierarchical structure.
