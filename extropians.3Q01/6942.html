<p><em>&gt; But this is not about whether we would be justified in killing Bin Laden

</em><br>
<em>&gt; genocide of millions of people!
</em><br>
<p><p>While I haven't seen anyone else, anywhere, speak in terms of genocide with
<br>
respect to US response to the 9-11 terrorist attacks (other than on this
<br>
list) I have seen a large number of people suggest indiscriminate bombing
<br>
and other means of killing large numbers of people.
<br>
<p>The ethical considerations are the same whether a whole people is wiped out
<br>
or whether only one innocent person is killed. The assumption that it's okay
<br>
to kill one innocent person in order to save several other lives is at the
<br>
root of the utilitarian nature of the responses on this list to Robert's
<br>
questions about whether genocide might be a solution to the terrorist
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p>I can think of situations where I would be tempted to say it's okay: one is
<br>
where passengers on an airliner are on a collision course with a skyscraper.
<br>
At the point at which it is clear that the passengers will be dead within a
<br>
few minutes, regardless of any action I might take, I think it would be
<br>
acceptable to shoot down the plane.
<br>
<p>I have asked myself what I would have done if I were on Flight 93, the one
<br>
where the passengers knew the likely destination of their plane, with a
<br>
hijacker holding a knife at the throat of another person, threatening to
<br>
kill that person if anyone else makes a move. What course of action should I
<br>
take? In this case, no matter what I do, innocent lives will be lost. This
<br>
is comparable to the example Eliezer brought up, where a murderous
<br>
government is attacked at the price of killing some innocent people. Based
<br>
on my past behavior in crisis situations, I'm fairly certain I would have
<br>
chosen to fight the hijacker, even knowing that a person's throat would be
<br>
slit the moment I made a move.
<br>
<p>But this sort of exception to the rule against killing innocent people is
<br>
dangerous, because it can lead to agreeing that it is okay to kill innocent
<br>
people whose lives are going to end tomorrow or next year rather than in
<br>
five minutes, or whose lives are worthless because they are unhappy or lived
<br>
in superstitious ignorance. I think this is what Robert was suggesting.
<br>
<p>My own personal rule is to consider all my options and only to risk harm to
<br>
another person (whether or not that person has initiated force against me)
<br>
if there is absolutely no other choice that's likely to save my life. In
<br>
dangerous situations, my usual strategy is to flee, unless I'm backed into a
<br>
corner, in which case I am willing to fight to the death of either myself or
<br>
my opponent.
<br>
<p>In the present terrorist case, I don't believe the US has been backed into a
<br>
corner, although I think the leaders perceive that they have been, for
<br>
reasons I've set forth in previous posts. This is the danger of my personal
<br>
rule: sometimes in the heat of danger, fear or lack of imagination prevent
<br>
one from considering all possible solutions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  But if you don't understand what your values are, what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are trying to achieve and how this is valuable, then the calculation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't provide an optimal answer.
</em><br>
<p>If one says only that one values human life, then cost-benefit analyses such
<br>
as Robert's make perfect sense. To avoid treating people as interchangeable
<br>
widgets, you have to value the individual person *as* a unique individual.
<br>
You have to state that you value each individual human's life, not just
<br>
generic human life.
<br>
<p>Viewing people as widgets is the root cause of all sorts of nasty isms,
<br>
including racism.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I get the worrying feeling that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have just assumed &quot;minimize number of deaths before singularity&quot; to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the value and optimization goal, and completely ignored issues of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kinds of *lives* there will be.
</em><br>
<p>The kinds of lives one could expect to live in societies founded on various
<br>
philosophies is an important question to address, even if most of us may
<br>
feel as though we have no power to change the societies in which we live.
<br>
I've observed that people generally have more power than they realize.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; OK, playing along with this game: what about foreign policy? By behaving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this, the US would demonstrate to all other nations that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous and willing to use force to achieve its goals even when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; victim has not attacked it. The logical conclusion for everybody else is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to view the US as the new rouge nation and start preparing to deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. Even if China, Russia, the EU and Australia might not share the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-emptive idea, they would see where the threat lies and act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accordingly. Hmm, suddenly the concept of MAD begins to rear its ugly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; head, doesn't it? And what happens when nano is being developed in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of scenario? You can guess - nano-MAD. Say hello to global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ecophagy.
</em><br>
<p>This is all true, but I think it's important to keep in mind that this
<br>
results ultimately from not valuing individual human lives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One should be able to voice *anything* to the extropians list, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most vile hate propaganda - but it is our responsibility to rip such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evil ideas to shreds according to the ideals of transhumanism.
</em><br>
<p>I was not going to post anything on this thread until I read this. You're
<br>
right, Anders. Each of us is responsible for speaking up if we wish to
<br>
direct our own lives to any extent. Thank you for pointing this out.
