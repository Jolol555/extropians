<p><em>&gt; I find that people will prefer to be treated different if that different

</em><br>
<em>&gt; will emphasize how old they are if there is a discount offered, while at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any other time they don't want to talk about how old they are. Women
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't want their sex or appearance to be a factor unless they happen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that it will give them an edge (government set-aside contracts, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance, or emphasizing one's cleavage to a male boss). Even elites are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not above this. A certain rock n' roll star I know always tells people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he does business with that 'he just wants to be treated like a regular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guy', except of course on those few occasions when he is trying to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a deal to his advantage, he whips out the old star treatment for whoever
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, but sometimes people will identify with a group for reasons
<br>
having nothing to do with personal advantage.  Sometimes people
<br>
feel very much a need to be part of something larger and stronger
<br>
than themselves, and having a &quot;people&quot; will do.  This is another
<br>
way of describing what I have against diversity, namely, it 
<br>
encourages this identification with the group.
