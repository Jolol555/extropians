</em><br>
<p>While I would like to read it as a Swiftean parody (and I still like
<br>
Robert as a very bright and creative person), one thing makes the post
<br>
worth critizising to pieces: that plenty of people on the list doesn't
<br>
seem to be averse to its reasoning. Imagine if Swifts proposal to solve
<br>
the Irish Problem by cannibalism had been received by some as a good
<br>
idea worth considering! So even if it was intended as a parody, it
<br>
might have the same effect as a serious proposal (i.e. nearly nothing,
<br>
since this list fortunately doesn't write US foreign policy; however,
<br>
the effects of allowing bad memes to creep into the transhumanist
<br>
perspective is very real). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps we must admit that on the event horizon of deed so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horrifying and morally reprehensible as to elude sane analysis,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our extropic notions and individualistic objectivist theory breaks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down as completely as do all the other methods of calculus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the suffering of humanity.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Does it? I have so far not seen any such breakdown. Rather, Roberts post
<br>
showed that utilitarianism can easily diverge when you take too many
<br>
people or too grand future states into account.
