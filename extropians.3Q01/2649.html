<em>&gt; &gt; The founding fathers also did not think enough ahead to institute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mechanisms that would act to limit the growth of government authority,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like mandating sunset clauses, term limits, as well as preventing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; congressmen from being appointed to the Supreme Court, and preventing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; families of civil servants from establishing bureaucratic dynasties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This lack of foresight was inherent in the fact that the founders were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; generally of agrarian extraction, with little experience in the courts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and bureaucracies of the european governments. They lacked the vision to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forsee that the US would ever rival the european powers in governmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inertia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nonsense. Who was it with the revolution every couple of hundred years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quote?
</em><br>
<p>Jefferson believed there had to be a revolution every twenty years or so.
<br>
He also believed when he heard about the Constitution that the Revolution in
<br>
America had failed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The founding fathers of the US had enough sense to know that anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they did was futile in the long run. At least they kept the initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consitution pretty simple.
</em><br>
<p>I agree it's hard to bind future politicians to today's laws.  There will
<br>
always be those ready to overturn a good system -- and I'm not claiming the
<br>
Founders made one; I think the flaws inherent in their system gave us what
<br>
we have today: democratic despotism -- for short run gains.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you can come up with a set of bureaucratic rules that will prevent
</em><br>
bloat
<br>
<em>&gt; of bureaucracy on a timescale of centuries (i.e. will alter the very
</em><br>
essence
<br>
<em>&gt; of human societal nature), I'd like to see them. Ever played Nomic? It's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very enlightening game that aptly demonstrates politics on fast forward.
</em><br>
<p>I think the only thing you can do is try to promote a culture that values
<br>
freedom, mistrusts government, and is generally rational.  On the political
<br>
side, this necessitates keeping government as small as possible and
<br>
definitely away from any area that might synergistically combine with it to
<br>
make it grow and grow and grow.  (E.g., education.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
