It sometimes helps to distinguish between various claims that are often run
<br>
together when discussing Whorf and friends:
<br>
1. Are all natural languages intertranslatable?
<br>
2. Are all natural languages learnable by all?
<br>
3. Are perception and language completely independent?
<br>
Whorf, I believe, answered no, yes, and no. People often run 1 and 2
<br>
together but these are quite separate issues. You can get an idea how to
<br>
separate 1 and 2 from the following quote from Whorf:
<br>
<p>&quot;That modern Chinese or Turkish scientists describe the world in the same
<br>
terms as Western scientists means, of course, only that they have taken over
<br>
bodily the entire Western system of rationalizations, not that they have
<br>
corroborated that system from their native posts of observation.&quot;
<br>
<p>Whorf was probably his own worst enemy by the way he runs different ideas
<br>
together. But I think this is what he says. (My evidence, obviously, is more
<br>
than just this quote). Translation, strictly speaking, is a matter of
<br>
pairing words, phrases, or sentences between languages.  If Whorf is correct
<br>
then we must presume that the project of translating Western science
<br>
semantically alters and expands the Chinese or Turkish languages, i.e.,
<br>
there is no way to translate Western science into an unaltered Chinese or
<br>
Turkish language. That is, these languages undergo semantic expansion as
<br>
they encounter modern European languages. This is of course not to say that
<br>
the Chinese or the Turks cannot learn western science, it is simply that
<br>
they must learn new semantic terms, not simply find synonyms in their own
<br>
language. The real trick, in my opinion, to understand 3 is to get clear
<br>
what one counts as the appropriate 'observation language'. I see a white
<br>
computer in front of me but someone who has no contact with modern
<br>
technology is not likely to use a similar description. If we looked for some
<br>
description that was neutral between us then it might be 'white thing'.
<br>
Rosch et al suggest that we share the same sorts of exemplars for 'white'
<br>
etc., the question is how this relates to the higher level categories that
<br>
characterize our higher level observation language. It is quite consistent
<br>
with Whorf, it seems to me, that the Eskimos and I share the same exemplar
<br>
for white but that I fail to observe their famous six types of snow. Mark.
