<p>Somehow it feels wrong to use a term including 'human' in this case. Or
<br>
rather, once such entities appear a name will be found, and it is likely
<br>
not going to be &quot;transhuman&quot;. But before they appear we might want a term
<br>
for this hypothetical class of beings, and then it could be used.
<br>
<p>However, I prefer to make a distinction between transhumans and posthumans.
<br>
Your beings would be posthumans according to the definition on my website:
<br>
<p>TRANSHUMAN: Someone actively preparing for becoming posthuman. Someone who
<br>
is informed enough to see radical future possibilities and plans ahead for
<br>
them, and who takes every current option for self-enhancement. See also the
<br>
Extropian FAQ for their definition of Transhuman. [Term: FM-2030, Are You A
<br>
Transhuman? Def.: Max More (The word was used earlier by Damien Broderick
<br>
in The Judas Mandala 1982(of which an excerpt called &quot;Growing Up&quot; was
<br>
published in Galileo 1976), and in &quot;Transhuman 2000&quot; by FM-2030 in Woman in
<br>
the Year 2000 (Ed. Maggie Tripp) in the 60's or early 70's)] 
<br>
<p>POSTHUMAN: Persons of unprecedented physical, intellectual, and
<br>
psychological capacity, self-programming, self-constituting, potentially
<br>
immortal, unlimited individuals. See also the Extropian FAQ for their
<br>
definition of Posthuman. [Term: FM-2030 Def.: Max More]  
<br>
<p>Transhuman appears to be defined not in terms of actual enhancements, but
<br>
rather in intention and action rather than what cool hardware is used.
<br>
Someone getting an artificial heart might be a cyborg, but unless this is a
<br>
part of a deliberate move towards future self-enhancement it doesn't make
<br>
him a transhuman. 
<br>
<p>I think the &quot;every option for self-enhancement&quot; part might be a bit too
<br>
extreme; I do enhance my life deliberately, but I have to leave out plenty
<br>
of options simply due to time constraints.
