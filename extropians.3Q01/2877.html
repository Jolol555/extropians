I'm still waiting on someone to say what the racists statements, tones, and
<br>
attitudes have been said here. I haven't heard anyone make any racists
<br>
statements. I haven't heard anyone say that any particular race was
<br>
inherently superior. I've heard bigoted ones, and I've heard discriminatory
<br>
ones. I know this may seem like nitpicking definitions, but its important
<br>
that words keep their meanings else more confusion erupts. If your going to
<br>
use the word racist, please have the common courtesy to know what it means,
<br>
and how it differs from bigoted and discriminatory.
<br>
<p>P.S. Another pet peeve of mine is there is no such word as &quot;Disrepecting&quot;!
<br>
Webster would be rolling over in his grave :)
