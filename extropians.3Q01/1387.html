<p>I think I will now definitely start worrying about sudden suffocation, in

case all the air molecules in this room decide to converge on one corner

of the room, due to a statistical fluke, leaving me with a lungful of hard

<br>
<p>Imo, you're describing an exceedingly small region of phase space.
<br>
Overwhelmingly improbable the system will go there.
<br>
<p>Under conscious you probably mean sentient. I'm laboring under the
<br>
illusion of being sentient, but I don't find expansion pointless. I know a
<br>
great many sentients who think expansion is very desirable. (Irrationality
<br>
is a valuable trait for a space search). To be expansive, you don't need
<br>
to be sentient, in fact being sentient is probably a negative selection
<br>
trait. The pioneer originating culture was almost certainly sentient, but
<br>
the pioneers are going to be very minimalist, streamlined beings. Less
<br>
atoms to cast into self, shorter development cycles, and none of that
<br>
leisurly 'analytic rumination' thing. Pioneers are not philosophers,
<br>
they're specialists.
<br>
<p>Hey, who said they're going to be nice? Look around; do you think the
<br>
fitness function selects for niceness, and self-limitation? Afraid it
<br>
ain't so, in fact, quite the opposite.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (a) Life, of the non-conscious variety can expand only very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     slowly (panspermia via meteors).
</em><br>
<p>Life which once (long time ago, in a galaxy far away) used to be sentient
<br>
can be very, very speedy. Panspermia via impact ejecta contamination
<br>
meanism seems to have been ruled out, as interstellar pebble capture
<br>
doesn't occur in geologic time scale.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (b) Life, of the non-technological variety can't expand any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     faster than the non-conscious variety.
</em><br>
<p>The difference between technological and nontechnological life is
<br>
arbitrary. Postbiology doesn't make a difference between critter and tool.
<br>
I live in vacuum, and eat iced carbonaceous chondrite, and sail between
<br>
the stars on gray sails. Am I animal, vegetable, or mineral?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (c) Life, of the non-conscious &amp; non-technological varieties
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     is subject to natural selection via planetary &amp; galactic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     hazards that probably resets the clock relatively frequently.
</em><br>
<p>Possible. The planetary hazards alone seem to hint at rare Earth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (d) Rare life of the conscious technological variety rapidly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     makes it through the singularity transition.
</em><br>
<p>Not all of it, and not every single agent in a population. The edge
<br>
selection effect selects for just one thing: expansion. Only those aspects
<br>
of development which facilitate that are inherited.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (e) Natural selection *FAILS* when the S-curve of the singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     flattens out at the top with the complete optimization of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     all local matter at the atomic engineering scale.
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't follow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just as humans have *almost* trumped natural selection on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Earth (no more bears in Europe or tigers in India...),
</em><br>
<p>Humans are very darwinian. It's just the fitness function has changed.
<br>
There's always radiation after a founder effect. We haven't started
<br>
shedding replicators into space, but we will in a few decades. In case I'm
<br>
not too frail physically (fat chance), I wouldn't mind going into space,
<br>
and do a little off-planet industry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; JBrains &amp; MBrains will trump natural selection in the universe.
</em><br>
<p>JBrains &amp; MBrains are subject to natural selection themselves. They're not
<br>
monodes, but population pockets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They &quot;FIX&quot; the hazard function so it is virtually nonexistant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (at least until the protons decay).  After you trump natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection, the logical game is self-directed conscious evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which may rely on natural selection for internal development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategies, but it isn't visible externally).
</em><br>
<p>I don't follow that assessment. Started in a darwinian regime, I don't see
<br>
a selection mechanism which makes you strip that regime entirely,
<br>
sustainably. Evolution is default.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The path of evolution is to drive complexification, but you cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexify in an efficient manner unless you know what has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tried and failed.  There is a huge cost to trying something that
</em><br>
<p>A failure in one context can be a success in a changed context. Analysis
<br>
and book-keeping is associated with costs. Look at sexual display, or
<br>
haute couture.
<br>
<p>I can't follow you here either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; has already been tried which doesn't work.  Nature doesn't care about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this (e.g. it will try &quot;failures&quot; again and again) because it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give a damn about the optimal allocation of limited resources.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Advanced conscious technological civilizations *do* care about such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allocations because the cost of getting any more of them is high.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, there is lots around to grab, but once you have them, they can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicate to you what designs have been tried and fail due to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed of light delays and large-body-of-information communication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costs.
</em><br>
<p>What's the point in you having children?
<br>
<p>You don't, because you're too rational to see a point in it?
<br>
<p>Then, it seems such strategy will not make measurable impact, keeping the
<br>
stage clear for other players. (If total population declines temporally,
<br>
it doesn't mean that all subpopulations are shrinking. Sooner or later,
<br>
the dynamic fraction will dominate).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The bigger the wavefront, the slower you have to go unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you consciously, intentionally want to waste the resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (e.g. two MBrains on opposite sides of the wavefront are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying the exact same sub-atomic engineering designs at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly the same time).
</em><br>
<p>The wavefront is an expanding sphere. The wavefront selects for just one
<br>
thing: a complex speed/fecundity. This does not describe a specific
<br>
technology a priori, and if anything, it deprecates sentience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For reasons, like the black hole engineering strategies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussed by Mike &amp; Anders, there may be only certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific places in the galaxy where you can go, where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you may have the matter and energy resources that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow you to start the next S-curve of technological evolution.
</em><br>
<p>Which level of tech do you need to colonize the Solar system? But for
<br>
minor missing pieces (closed-circuit portable ecologies) we have the
<br>
technology already. In a few decades we can send our first intestellar
<br>
mission, slow, very slow, but if the Singularity critters are not going to
<br>
expand, the rest of it is all ours, hein?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; JBrains &amp; MBrains *know* they don't want to get bigger.
</em><br>
<p>The ecology knows it doesn't want to colonize new substrate. Duh. JBrains
<br>
&amp; MBrains are *ecologies*. Very diverse ecologies at that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They want to get &quot;smaller&quot;.  They will either know from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a theory of everything and/or having tried trillions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible designs that doing so is &quot;impossible&quot; or dedicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the resources available in the most efficient way possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the exploration of the sub-atomic engineering phase space.
</em><br>
<p>All is very well, but will they vanish all, quantitatively? Every single
<br>
one of them? How probable is that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, if as Frank points out, you can build reversible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers that trump any non-reversible computer and you need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of those to take the next steps in sub-atomic engineering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations *and* they require a saturn-mass of silicon to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do the engineering, then you are going to go to the location
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where that much silicon is available for astroengineering.
</em><br>
<p>Good for you. I'll stay here, and breed. And expand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You aren't going to run willy-nilly around your local region
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of space terraforming every planet or JBraining &amp; MBraining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every star system because it isn't going to get you any
</em><br>
<p>Guess what, I am. Going to. Unless you'll stop me. And I know of a lot of
<br>
people who're positively pathologically expansive. Some would do it to
<br>
only make an obscure point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; closer to having sub-atomic engineering capabilities or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowing that they are not feasible.
</em><br>
<p>Engineering is tres cool, but sometimes I also just want to party.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For Eugene's premises to be valid he has to make a strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertion that advanced technological civilizations do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reach the conclusion that trying to ignore Malthus is doomed.
</em><br>
<p>Uh, no. We're pretty advanced, almost sufficiently advanced to colonize
<br>
the galaxy, and I fear less than one of ten people off the street have
<br>
ever heard Malthus' name, if asked.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Sooner or later you run out of stars or galaxies!)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but how is that relevant to not being expansive? It rather motivates
<br>
for a gold rush, if anything.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Its assuming post-singularity technologies with pre-singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal motivational systems and irrational thinking.
</em><br>
<p>Postsingularity puts no constraints on the mental set of critters. And, of
<br>
course, you don't need to be Postsingularity to colonize at least the
<br>
local galaxy.
<br>
<p>So, the much more mundane explanation for Fermi's paradoxon is that we're
<br>
very, very rare. So, that gives us the mandate on a power lunch on the
<br>
universe, at least that part of universe we can reach before runaway
<br>
spacetime expansion extinguishes the party lights, and sends us home,
<br>
soaking wet, in the dark.
