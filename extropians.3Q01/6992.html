<p>
Yes, I know I'm supposed to be offline in reflective consideration.
<br>
Yes, I know that even raising this perspective is going to doom
<br>
me to exile in the swamps by a majority of list members.
<br>
<p>However, this is a list that is &quot;supposed&quot; to be based on
<br>
the &quot;rational&quot; discussion of ideas and perspectives.
<br>
<p>First, I want to preface the discussion by explaining to list
<br>
members that over the last 6-8 years I've spent an extensive
<br>
amount of time (20-30% of my life) in Russia.  That experience has
<br>
fundamentally changed my American perspective that everything is as
<br>
it &quot;appears to be&quot; to one of doubt, suspicion and questioning that
<br>
everything is *not* as it appears to be.  So before you jump all
<br>
over my perspective, please ask yourselves the question of
<br>
&quot;What if you are wrong?&quot; -- &quot;What if perhaps I might have an
<br>
insight into a reality that does in fact exist and operates
<br>
in the &quot;real&quot; world&quot;.  I'm as hesitant as the next person to
<br>
jump onto the next conspiracy bandwagon -- but to fail to
<br>
look for conspiracies where they might really exist is foolish.
<br>
<p>Some people on the list may be aware of the history of bombings in
<br>
Russia that have been attributed to the Chechnyans over the last
<br>
several years.  However, if one observes the bombings very carefully --
<br>
where and when they occur, how they are utilized in the state-manipulated
<br>
press, etc. and if one is aware of the Russian history and mindset --
<br>
one must begin to ask whether or not the bombings were &quot;arranged&quot; to promote
<br>
specific political agendas.
<br>
<p>I will now raise the unspeakable question -- could the recent
<br>
&quot;terrorist&quot; events have been engineered by U.S. politicians?
<br>
<p>The benefits are obvious -- a payback to the religions &quot;right&quot;,
<br>
significantly diminished barriers towards getting increased
<br>
&quot;crime fighting&quot; agendas through Congress, increased law enforcement
<br>
&quot;rights&quot;, etc.
<br>
<p>The objections are obvious as well -- such a collection of individuals
<br>
would never be &quot;air-tight&quot;, no true Americans or foreigners would
<br>
ever choose to behave in this way, etc.
<br>
<p>As much as I am repulsed by the concept, I am forced to point out
<br>
that *if* foreign nationals could be trained or indoctrinated towards
<br>
behaving in irrational and unextropic patterns (the bin Laden camp)
<br>
one has to seriously question whether or not U.S. citizens or foreign
<br>
nationals (with an otherwise neutral agendas) could not also be persuaded
<br>
to behave in the same way?
<br>
<p>Hopefully stimulating thought rather than reactions,
<br>
Robert
