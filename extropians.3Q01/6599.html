From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Sen.%20Judd%20Gregg%20(R-New%20Hampshire)%20called%20for%20a%20global%20prohibition%20on%20encryption&In-Reply-To=&lt;003801c13e09$c1f3e960$c75c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; What I meant is that we now have to re-do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process of stopping Clipper again. This time it is likely an even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nastier version of the Clipper proposal, supported by the current mood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but also hampered by its last defeat.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I get it now. Please excuse my slowness in comprehending your analysis and
<br>
position, which is somewhat more complicated than at first it appears. Anyway,
<br>
you've clarified and summed it up eloquently in those two sentences, imo.
<br>
Thanks for taking the time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Aha, so do you think the ACLU or EFF would be allowed to sit in on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant boards? They are already well-known and have well-known views.
</em><br>
<p>Are you and Max More members of the ACLU or EFF?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Joking aside, what makes the US a democracy and not a dictatorship is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you actually hold your president accountable and demand that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justifies his major decisions. If he declares war on San Marino &quot;because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I say so&quot; I doubt he will remain in office.
</em><br>
<p>He probably wouldn't fare very well in San Marino either. Not to get too
<br>
serious about this, I think you're correct about the necessity of rational
<br>
debate. Nevertheless, when it comes to questions about that sensitive subject
<br>
_national security_, reason frequently takes a back seat to ideology. In the
<br>
end, democracies don't decide things on the basis of reason. No, they decide
<br>
things on the basis of votes (and even that is sometimes disputed). So, Judd
<br>
Gregg will support Clipper chips because he believes that doing so will get
<br>
him more votes than opposing Clipper chip technology. Whatever nominally
<br>
rational debate he offers in defense of his position (and presently that need
<br>
not be much), will be motivated by his desire to promote his personal agenda
<br>
and advance his career, because he is ultimately accountalble to his
<br>
constituents, and not to the extropic principle that &quot;the ideal controller is
<br>
nobody.&quot; The sad political reality is that legislative bosses are less
<br>
accountable than are their private industry counterparts. Make a defective
<br>
product, and you can go to jail. Make a defective law, and taxpayers suffer
<br>
the consequences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Many have complained that we on this list never do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything, but that is not really true: those who act do it outside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list, getting their hands dirty and not having the time to constantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comment on it. Hmm, methinks I post too much :-)
</em><br>
<p>OTOH, the more you post to the list, the more of a target you present. If
<br>
Kurzweil and Hawking would post directly to this list so that their minions
<br>
wouldn't have to misrepresent them and spin their own versions of the
<br>
digerati, we might find they're followers as much as leaders. Is it that they
<br>
don't have time to constantly comment, or is it that they don't want their
<br>
comments to be constantly subjected to scrutiny? Worse yet, they might
<br>
discover that their comments elicit no more response than those of spammers
<br>
and trolls. Or perhaps they post to their own private lists? Doesn't matter to
<br>
me. I approach mailing lists as an exercise in meditation. Sometimes it's as
<br>
entertaining to read the reactionary crackpots as to respond to those who
<br>
reaffirm the relevance of reason.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thanks, but you should see me play Alpha Centauri...
</em><br>
<p>Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri from Loki Games? Linux version?
<br>
Never get my hands dirty with that off-list stuff...  hehehe

Throughout the ages of humanity, the urge to explore new horizons has called
<br>
upon our deepest instincts. Yet Earth now lies open, its every corner
<br>
inhabited, every depth known like the lines of your hand. But time and
<br>
technology have given you the chance the reach out for new, completely
<br>
unexplored, uninhabited worlds to conquer, far from the bosom of old Mother
<br>
Earth. It is time for humanity to leave its cradle...
