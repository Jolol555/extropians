<em>&gt; &gt; The physicist Richard Feynman was one of the greatest geniuses of the

mediocre 125.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The best definition of intelligence that I can think of is &quot; the sort of

thing
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that Richard Feynman did&quot;  therefore the disgrace can not be Feynman's,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it's the advocates of the test who should feel embarrassed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Years later after he became famous and won the Nobel prize the people at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Mensa wrote to him and begged him to join, he took great delight in
</em><br>
telling
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them that he could not, he just wasn't smart enough.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I have a little bit to add on that: I have an IQ of 160, as many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IQ tests will attest, yet the school counselors told my parents that my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IQ was only 125. I've heard similar stories from many other people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are geniuses, and it's my opinion that the old &quot;IQ of 125&quot; is one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those little scams that the teaching establishment does to eliminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; special treatment of genius kids.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe the school counselors subtracted a few points from you for your lack
<br>
of insight about some things &quot;in general&quot;; furthermore, you may have lost a
<br>
few more points in the &quot;compassion&quot; category.

<em>&gt; Those same counselors claimed I had the same IQ as my older brother, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he was a dope to the point that we were taking the same math classes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high school even though I was two years younger, and I was tutoring him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the homework. I got A's on tests, he got C minuses on tests.
