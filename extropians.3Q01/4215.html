<em>&gt; Hi all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was hoping somebody could help clear something up for me. I've just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been looking at Max More's Phd thesis on self ownership, which I take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is largley part of the extropian philosophy. He says that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind/body dualsim should be usurped in favour of seeinng them as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole, i.e. what effects the mind also effects the body. But a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you on the list want to finally upload your minds - in effect becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disembodied. How do you work this contradition out? Anders, Natasha
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and More all seem to be suggesting the importance of the body to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self - but there are a majority of you who want to forget the body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altogehther and upload. I'm confused.
</em><br>
<p>There is no contradiction. Max's thesis does not demand that the body be
<br>
necessarily a *human* (i.e. homo sapiens) body, or that the word 'body'
<br>
be limited solely to a biological system.
<br>
<p>We recognise that much of the human race defines itself by its physical
<br>
appearance, but only because sight is such a dominant sense (at least
<br>
for males), with one's 'feelings' being a close second (but dominant in
<br>
women). Both are assumed by the public to be absent from a mind that is
<br>
removed from its original human body, especially if its body is replaced
<br>
with an artifical construct, and are assumed to be impossible to attain
<br>
for an artificial intelligence. We don't assume these things.
<br>
<p>We generally think that you are you, no matter what body you are in.
<br>
Your sense of self will still be highly dependent upon you sight and/or
<br>
feelings, rather than your thoughts, which is what your true self is.
