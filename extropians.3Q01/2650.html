<p>Evidently, I am just as familiar with the history of this era as you are.

<p><em>&gt; Fantasy alliances of all the world powers against the US are rather

</em><br>
<p>Oh, dear.  And I had written the sentence (see above), 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Consideration of examples like this is warranted by our

</em><br>
<p>precisely for people like you.  When libertarians write that taxation
<br>
is *never* justified, they invite real as well as imaginary counter-
<br>
examples.  Perhaps you are simply not interested in theoretical general-
<br>
ities.  That's fine.  But please try to understand that some of us are, and
<br>
we really would like to know under what **general** circumstances, if any,
<br>
we would approve of a society forcably extracting (i.e. stealing)
<br>
resources from some of its members.
