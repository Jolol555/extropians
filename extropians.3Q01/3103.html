<p>Sorry, can't back you on this one.  Forums are best held together not by a
<br>
conceived obligation of &quot;openness&quot;, but by open-minded people who aren't
<br>
afraid of being *accused* of close-mindedness, and are hence willing to
<br>
undertake the pruning necessary to keep discussions intelligent. 
<br>
Discussions are moved forward, not by the ten thousand critics who are
<br>
wrong and clueless, but by the hundred critics who are wrong and smart,
<br>
and above all by the one critic who is smart and right.  Seeking out that
<br>
one critic requires that you be willing to tell the ten thousand others to
<br>
go do their repetitive babbling on some other mailing list that's actually
<br>
interested.  Smart critics are *valuable*.  The one critic who's right
<br>
isn't likely to stick around and put in the effort to make himself(*)
<br>
heard if he sees that you aren't doing anything but arguing the same basic
<br>
subjects over and over.  The ten thousand useless critics, having vastly
<br>
overestimated their own intelligence, will insist that you are being
<br>
close-minded.  The only correct response to this is &quot;Goodbye.&quot;
<br>
<p>Every objection, no matter how stupid, deserves to be answered; every
<br>
critic, no matter how clueless, deserves to be debated; but most of them
<br>
deserve to be answered and debated after the Singularity, not right now,
<br>
when I'm busy.
<br>
<p>Anyone want to revive the Committee on Un-Extropian Activities?  I think
<br>
this list could really use it.
