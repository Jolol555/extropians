<em>&gt;&gt; Many people on this list are under the influence of some powerful

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When is taking the opposite of this the best policy?
</em><br>
<p>Only under vanishingly rare conditions, so far as I can see.
<br>
A nation might rightfully steal wealth from some of its
<br>
individuals in a time of national emergency---if it's either
<br>
that or be conquered by an enemy army, then I'd find it
<br>
justified.  Taking the second point, I guess that I can't
<br>
see any case where indolence should be encouraged.
<br>
<p>Here is a case where I might not mind my own business:  say in
<br>
my small community a certain man is known to beat his wife so
<br>
savagely that she is actually afraid to protest; in the market
<br>
place we repeatedly reminded by the constant bruises on her
<br>
countenance.  I'm not opposed to some citizens going to this
<br>
individual and demanding that he stop; and if he refuses, I'm
<br>
not opposed to discussing means to make him stop.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Under what conditions is it morally right to steal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encourage indolence, and lie?
</em><br>
<p>Probably this isn't what you mean, but sometimes *individuals*
<br>
have the legal right to lie, especially in the making of so-called
<br>
white lies.  But I totally agree with your drift.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Further, who gets to decide the conditions under which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such an opposing approach is called for?
</em><br>
<p>For some countries in some situations, as I said, there
<br>
can arise extraordinary circumstances that threaten the
<br>
well being of everyone.  I'm not opposed in principle to
<br>
nations' governments having such emergency powers.  But
<br>
I will grant that perhaps the dangers of implementing
<br>
institutions that can execute such policies may outweigh
<br>
their benefit:  look at what has happened to the United
<br>
States since Abraham Lincoln suspended citizens legal
<br>
rights, and even started drafting them?  The extremely
<br>
substantial loss of liberties formerly enjoyed by Americans
<br>
does, I admit, illustrate the risks of ever letting government
<br>
get so strong.
<br>
<p>But in the final analysis, it boils down to the character
<br>
of the people as a whole:  liberty could work in early Colonial
<br>
America and in the early nation.  Since then, either we've had
<br>
too many immigrants (like my own ancestors) who just don't get
<br>
it, or there are such high population densities now that 
<br>
individual responsibility has become too diluted.
