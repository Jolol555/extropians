Quick response to Greg's demonization of Islam:
<br>
<p>The Israelis quote the Old Testament to justify their atrocities in Israel;
<br>
shall we condemn Judaism?
<br>
<p>And if Islam is so nasty, how come Moslem countries were historically more
<br>
tolerant of other religions than Christian Europe?  Christians and Jews were
<br>
second-class citizens in the Arab Empire, but they were citizens.  In Europe
<br>
Moors weren't, and Jews were confined to the ghetto, or subjected to pogroms,
<br>
at least for a long time.
<br>
<p>I don't think you can brush over the history of these peoples.  Afghanistan is
<br>
a poor, violent, country, which got abused by the Soviets.  The Palestinians
<br>
were among the most well-off and educated of the Arabs, before they got
<br>
invaded by the Jews and then crushed between them and the Arab armies.  The
<br>
whole region's poor, resource-poor, and colonialized enough to develop
<br>
grievances and not enough to pick up good habits.  Except maybe for Iraq,
<br>
which was a good secular country before the Gulf War... with sanctions, come
<br>
poverty; with poverty, comes religion, and veils on women...  The revolution
<br>
in Iran has something to do with with our support of the oppressive Shah.  And
<br>
yet, Iran seems to have the most democratic structure of any Arab country (not
<br>
that Iran is Arabic); it's just that the democratic decisions get overruled by
<br>
the clerics.  But there's movement toward moderation.
