The original struck me as a piece of a general pattern of

dismissal of some concerns that I believe have validity.  It was

not that but I reacted as if it were that general pattern

unfolding (yet again).  Sorry.

<p><em>&gt; &gt;I agree it requires a rebuttal.

<em>&gt; &gt;  Hopefully such will say what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;*scientism* is and is not.  I do think there is something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;word does apply fairly to but not of the kind or to the degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that P.O.C. alluded to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, it's certainly not the same as a commitment to rational standards of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inquiry and criticism in our search for explanations of phenomena and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge of the world.
</em><br>
<p>This is true.  It hinges more on the extend of what is
<br>
considered world and what is and is not considered knowable and
<br>
valuable.
<br>
<p>Thank you for the quotation from some of your past work.  It
<br>
helps me know where you are coming from.  You are certainly one
<br>
who cares about the relevant questions deeply and who does not
<br>
tend to over-emphasize or denigrate any side of the equation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If there is a use for the word &quot;scientism&quot; it might apply to the position of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone who entirely rejected the domain of aesthetic/cultural value (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is at least part of what you seem to mean by the &quot;spiritual&quot; domain). But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even this would not be a &quot;religion&quot; as far as I can see, more a state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychological impoverishment. Nor does it strike me as a position that could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be derived from rational analysis of any kind. In any event, I have no basis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at this stage for believing that anyone on this list is stricken with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientism as I've just defined it. If you, who have been here much longer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a different perception, I won't argue - I'll leave that to others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>As I've written elsewhere, what I see as scientism is more of an
<br>
anti-religion - especially in its aspect of reducing everything
<br>
to simply matter and physics with little room for valuing or
<br>
values much less for the sacred.
