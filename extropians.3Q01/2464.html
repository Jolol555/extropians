</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Nice going, Robin Hood. I think you split the arrow in the bull's eye.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Ubiquitous religiosity&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; At which point, the term loses all meaning, indicating that someone is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trying to paint with too broad a brush.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are universals in social-political sciences, or close to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universals. For example, all societies I know of have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaders. Purposiveness of all institutions quickly takes us into values,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mores, totem and taboo...RELIGION.
</em><br>
<p>Again, too broad a brush. Religion applys ubiquitously to all aspects of
<br>
society only so long as those aspects are not understood by science,
<br>
when there is still 'mystery' about the working of nature. Religion is
<br>
explaination of nature by ad hoc bardism, not by cross examination,
<br>
testing, hypothesis and experiment. Looking critically at nature is
<br>
blasphemy to religion as a matter of course, as nature just IS and 'it
<br>
is not our place' to look critically at it. 
<br>
Scientific examination over time erodes the ubiquity of religion as more
<br>
becomes known and less is mysterious. Equating science with religion is
<br>
an exercise of a sort of deconstructivism and moral relativity that is a
<br>
sort of 'means justifying the ends' amorality (since deconstructivism
<br>
and moral relativity are themselves primarily the tools of the
<br>
anti-religious) of strategy that implicates the bankruptcy to which
<br>
religion has descended in its 'fight or flight' fear response to the
<br>
illuminating effect of science.
