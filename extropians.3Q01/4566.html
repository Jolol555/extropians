<em>&gt; &gt; I think the really interesting question (though I'm admittedly too lazy to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My guess would be that the earlier a state enfranchised its women, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; smaller was the ratio of women to men.  It's one thing to enfranchise a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; previously alienated voting block which constitutes a small minority of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; voting population.  It's quite another to do it if that block will become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the voting majority.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that you're probably right.  That would certainly go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards explaining why Wyoming was the first U.S. state.
</em><br>
<p>Another thing to consider is the degree of aristocratic rule. If the
<br>
aristocracy is keeping the underclass working in the mines on election
<br>
day, they certainly don't want their workers' wives being able to vote
<br>
in their husband's stead....
