<p>Yes.  In fact, one of my bothers who was at Extor-5  is a Christian who
<br>
goes to church and he is someone who I adore and admire his accomplishments
<br>
in the medical profession.  But he is only one of the many outstanding
<br>
people who I know who are religious and attend church.

<p><em>&gt;&gt;spirituality are

</em><br>
<p>I agree with you.  I don't buy this. It makes the future quite cold and
<br>
indifferent.  I think that some memes got started early on prescribing a
<br>
view that technology and rational were the source for future survival.
<br>
What about creativity, curiosity, joy, desire, love of life! :-)  What I do
<br>
invest in is the fact that it takes vision, creativity, emotions, musings,
<br>
etc. to even be able to envision a future full of possibilities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Some of us are there because we grok the deep transcendent

<em>&gt;&gt; Unless and until those who petition their particular religions views to
</em><br>
