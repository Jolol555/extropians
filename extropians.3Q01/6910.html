<em>&gt;Hmmmmm this brings me onto another topic, that many ppl on this list am

</em><br>
<em>&gt;would instinctively react against. But does the situation with Bin Laden
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>I suppose you could show that both good and bad for society might come great 
<br>
personal wealth. But the main point is that society has the RIGHT to make 
<br>
such decisions. Since the great majority of wealth in the world in held by a 
<br>
few, then we may assume that great efforts will be expended to persuade 
<br>
society that great personal wealth is a Good Thing.
<br>
That is b/c actions tend to be more effective when directed by a single 
<br>
actor as opposed to being directed by a committee, etc. The motivation (to 
<br>
persuade society) is certainly there--that's really inarguable.  And 
<br>
certainly, the means (to persuade society) is there. Heh, heh, in fact that 
<br>
(in the hands of a few, relatively) is where the *means* is...
<br>
<p>Now, I am the kinda person who likes to look at things in a cause and effect 
<br>
way, and I see the world as a hodgepodge of force vectors, pointing in many 
<br>
different directions, and of varying magnitudes.
<br>
Some vectors are big, some are small.  Vectors may be organized together by 
<br>
sentient creatures so as to accomplish some task. The more sentient beings 
<br>
that attempt such organization, the less effective they are at accomplishing 
<br>
the task. But since so much wealth is in the hands of a few, I would fully 
<br>
expect that those few would be very effective at accomplishing tasks 
<br>
undertaken jointly. Socialism/communism must surely be a foe to be fought 
<br>
most tenaciously by those with great wealth. But where and how do they fight 
<br>
this fight?
<br>
<p>So, being the kind of guy I am, I see those massive force vectors, I see the 
<br>
motivation for persuading the public that wealth accumulation is a Good 
<br>
Thing, and I think...hmmm...that kind of force, wielded by so few, with such 
<br>
high motivational factors, there must surely be some effect upon society 
<br>
visible to me, Randy Smith. So, I go looking for it.
<br>
And everywhere I go I see, like bomb craters,  the aftereffects of these 
<br>
organized force vectors...your post, quoted above, is an aftereffect....
<br>
no offense....
