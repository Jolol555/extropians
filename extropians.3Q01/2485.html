Lee said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I meant to say, are there really people who don't agree that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;you have to have a *theory* of what makes laws good and bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before condemning particular laws&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>It's just that some of the statements I was reading struck me as 
<br>
under-theorised, hence my comment (but who knows?). E.g the &quot;taxation is 
<br>
theft&quot; meme seems to avoid questions about when is it and is it not *morally 
<br>
reasonable* to have legal norms relating to property based on considerations 
<br>
similar to Locke's theory, or the homesteading theory? When is it *morally 
<br>
reasonable* to qualify such property laws with laws relating to an 
<br>
obligation to pay taxes (to contribute to social aims etc)? To me, there's a 
<br>
lot of theorising that needs to be done here and what I can see of it casts 
<br>
doubt on simple ideas about &quot;taking what 'belongs' to someone else&quot; or about 
<br>
who first initiates force.
<br>
<p>BTW (this is not in direct response to your comment) I'm really starting to 
<br>
wonder show I should treat discussions of political philosophy on this list. 
<br>
I see myself as in a minority position here in not accepting Randian 
<br>
libertarianism or anything that closely resembles it, despite having broadly 
<br>
libertarian instincts with regard to both social and economic issues. I do 
<br>
acknowledge that there's some spread of positions among the libertarians - 
<br>
for example, I think that Mike's attitude to corporations is quite different 
<br>
from that of Felix. I think Mike's is the more consistent position, while 
<br>
understanding the force of some of Felix's views.
<br>
<p>All this is interesting, but if I keep speaking up with an alternative view 
<br>
to the kind of libertarian philosophy that you, Mike, Felix, Daniel, Ralf, 
<br>
Jerry and (I think) quite a few others all share, I can just see myself 
<br>
getting bogged down in interminable, energy-sapping debate with people whom 
<br>
I basically think of, or want to think of, as transhumanist allies.
<br>
<p>My style of doing philosophy involves a lot of introspection and 
<br>
soul-searching for my own deepest intuitions, etc (it involves very little 
<br>
in the way of deploying ready-made answers), which I'd rather use for the 
<br>
cause of opposing luddites etc than arguing about whether it is (or can be) 
<br>
okay to have taxes to fund (or help fund) the military, the police, the 
<br>
courts, schools, hospitals, universities, roads, welfare, a guaranted 
<br>
minimum income, etc. Subject to considerations of economic efficiency (which 
<br>
I have not discussed at all), I am not opposed to taxes for such reasons. 
<br>
Most people I know off this list would not think that to be very 
<br>
controversial, at least until I reached &quot;welfare&quot; and probably not until I 
<br>
reached &quot;guaranteed minimum income&quot;. However, it's obviously *very* 
<br>
controversial on this list, at least once we get past &quot;the courts&quot;.
<br>
<p>I'm genuinely perplexed about this, Lee. I may soon have to move into 
<br>
semi-lurk mode, or at least avoid such discussions, or my energies will just 
<br>
be spread too thinly. Conversely, I sense that you and the others don't find 
<br>
a lot of value in paragraphs that I might write along the lines of the one 
<br>
above commencing &quot;It's just that...&quot; You don't want to go away and spend a 
<br>
lot of time rethinking your most fundamental political beliefs, seeing 
<br>
whether they're based on (or perhaps inconsistent with) anything deeper - 
<br>
and why should you? Life is short for you as well, unless we win the battle 
<br>
for transhumanism. But, in that case, I'm asking myself why should I do a 
<br>
whole lot of philosophising that simply drains me and isn't of value to the 
<br>
list?
<br>
<p>Regards
<br>
<p>Russell
