Robin asked:
<br>
<em>&gt; Care to make any predictions about observational features
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of these objects? That is, if they were MB or JB, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would that predict about them?
</em><br>
<p>The Nature paper documents 7 events, 1 resolved and 6 unresolved.
<br>
The resolved event has a predicted mass of ~0.13 M_sun, which
<br>
would make it a red dwarf or white dwarf.  It isn't clear whether
<br>
the HST should be able to see stars of those masses at 2.6 kpc
<br>
(M22's distance).  The article does state that HST cannot detect
<br>
brown dwarfs (&lt; 0.08 M_sun) in globular clusters.
<br>
<p>If the resolved example is not a small star, then it could be a
<br>
Matrioshka Brain around a small star.  The properties of that should
<br>
be a black-body radiation spectral emission curve (i.e. no &quot;typical&quot;
<br>
stellar absorption or emission lines in the spectra) with an peak
<br>
emission frequency indicating a temperature ranging from 2.7K up
<br>
to perhaps 2000K with a higher probability for temperatures in
<br>
the range of 63-373K.  More accurate temperature predictions are
<br>
difficult because they depend to a large extent on how old the
<br>
Matrioshka Brain is and what material resources it has had
<br>
access to over its lifetime.
<br>
<p>The 6 unresolved objects (because the HST didn't take images
<br>
frequently enough to provide the full light curves) have
<br>
a guesstimated mass of ~0.25 M_jupiter which would put them
<br>
clearly in the Jupiter Brain class.  Alternatively they
<br>
could be Matrioshka Brains running off fusion reactors
<br>
(e.g. no internal star).  I would presume that the spectral
<br>
properties and temperature of these would be similar to those
<br>
previously stated, but Anders might have other opinions.
<br>
<p>I believe that Ander's Jupiter Brain design has a lot of fiber
<br>
connecting the internal nodes, if so, one needs a *lot* of
<br>
silicon for that.  If the spectra of the stars in the GC
<br>
indicate they are low in C/Si/O relative to other less useful
<br>
elements (perhaps Na, K, Ca, He, Kr, etc.) then that could
<br>
be an indication that star lifting is occurring and the
<br>
useless materials are being recycled back through the stars
<br>
until they end up as something more useful.
<br>
<p>Worth noting, is that *if* advanced civilizations choose
<br>
the &quot;stealth&quot; mode of existence, meandering gas giant
<br>
planets would make excellent homes.  Lots of gas to
<br>
shield the nanotech from external radiation and anyone
<br>
below your technology level is highly likely to assume
<br>
it is a &quot;natural&quot; object.  Its only when you notice one
<br>
of these sucking up hydrogen from a star or gas cloud that
<br>
you are going to get suspicious.  You have to keep in mind
<br>
several of the gas giant planets in our solar system radiate
<br>
away more energy than they receive from the sun and we just
<br>
*assume* (with some calculations to support the idea presumably)
<br>
that this is heat remaining from the initial planet formation and
<br>
ongoing gravitational compression.
