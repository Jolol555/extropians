<em>&gt;From: &quot;Dickey, Michael F&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:michael_f_dickey@groton.pfizer.com?Subject=RE:%20Paying%20for%20Schools%20(was:%20SOCIETY:%20Re:%20The%20privatization%20of%20pu%20blic%20security)&In-Reply-To=&lt;F199cn8TtEvzoxJ6sJ900014095@hotmail.com&gt;">michael_f_dickey@groton.pfizer.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;&quot;Of course the only real options would be available to the wealthy.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of us would be relegated to sending our kids to the $.99 Store school.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I strongly disagree with this.  This is same argument that is always made
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against new products 'Why make them, only the rich will get them'  At one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point in time Automobiles, let alone choices in them, were confined to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rich.  Electricity was confined to the rich.  Running water, waste
</em><br>
<em>&gt;management, heat, etc. etc. etc  were ALL, at one time, confined to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rich.  Competition and capitalism has brought ALL of these things within 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;realm of the average person.
</em><br>
<p>That analogy doesn't work.  Its not like Ford was giving away free cars, and 
<br>
then someone proposed that he stop giving them away for free.  When the 
<br>
market for cars was young, they were a luxury.  Education is a necessity.
<br>
<p>Besides, when you say those goods are available to the &quot;average person&quot; 
<br>
aren't you really talking about the middle classes and above?  Where I'm 
<br>
from *poor* people still mostly use public transportation.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
