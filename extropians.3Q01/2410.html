<p><em>&gt;&gt; Ahem, I'm not getting the idea across.  Choosing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 'dollar-votes' is libertarian-speak for free choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; made through purchasing power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But before people go shopping with their wads of money grasped firmly in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their fists, somebody, somewhere decides CEOs' salaries.  Somebody,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere decides that sanitation workers (who perform an important function
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for our society) receive a lot less money than physicians (who also perform
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an important function for our society).
</em><br>
<p>The CEOs' salaries are determined by the board of directors,
<br>
composed of people acting in their own self-interest.  The
<br>
salaries of sanitation workers should be decided by the
<br>
market, in the sense that the jobs should be offered to
<br>
whatever people competant to take them who'll work for the
<br>
least.  (That's how my job is; if I'd asked for too much
<br>
money, my job would instead have gone to someone almost as
<br>
competant, but who'd work for less.)  Now labor unions do
<br>
complicate things: they get a lock on jobs, and won't let
<br>
other potential workers come in who'd do the job for less.
<br>
Physician salaries are also market driven, except that the
<br>
doctors have gotten together and used the power of government
<br>
(force, remember) to prevent anyone from practicing medicine
<br>
that they don't approve of.
<br>
<p>Now you may not be from the U.S., but I am very disappointed
<br>
that you didn't know how all these salaries were determined,
<br>
or should be determined if we had freedom.  I'm sorry, but I
<br>
think that you had better go read Milton Friedman's &quot;Free to
<br>
Choose&quot;, or David Friedman's &quot;The Machinery of Freedom&quot;.  I
<br>
shouldn't have had to write the previous two paragraphs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it's more like, somebody-somewhere decides, and then the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; march to their tune (through purchasing power).  Whether &quot;somebody-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere&quot; is a committee, a board of directors, or a corporation...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what's to prevent &quot;self-service above all&quot; from occurring?  (I sent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along another post regarding this, about the tech layoffs in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seattle area, which play into this subject.)
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry Olga, but this isn't how it works.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm saying that just because Spielberg
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; makes fifty million dollars a year, and some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; teacher makes twenty thousand, there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; need for some committee to decide how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Mr. Spielberg &quot;is really entitled to&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to transfer (by force, not persuasion) some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; portion of his income to teachers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But don't the teachers transfer some of their income to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spielberg, as well?  (I'm talking about taxes, not movie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tickets.)
</em><br>
<p>How am I to respond to that.  Would you please explain how
<br>
Mr. Spielberg gets his hands on the tax receipts.  I won't
<br>
continue this conversation unless you explain notions like
<br>
this beforehand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Doesn't Spielberg get more than enough to live on, in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case (whether he pays taxes or not)?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but so what?  Or are you inching towards saying that
<br>
the government should have a legal right to his earnings,
<br>
in order to give money away to poor people?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not exactly rich, but I can tell you I've been living for free since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1981, since the first time I owned a house.  What a surprise it was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first time I sold that house - not only did I get all the money back from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest, principal, and all the money I ever put into construction costs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realtor's fees and the rest - but I actually made more money.
</em><br>
<p>Yes!  You are quite right.  The present situation is a rip-off of the
<br>
people who aren't quite well-off enough to be able to afford buying
<br>
a home.  I certainly pay a lot less, like you, for a roof over my head
<br>
than the poor renters in my city.  But this evil situation was created
<br>
by the existence of governments using force, and you want to fix the
<br>
situation by using more force.  That wasn't the answer in the country
<br>
you came from, and it's not the answer here.
<br>
<p>Now where geography is a limiting factor, e.g., San Francisco, the
<br>
prices of land and houses will fly through the roof in any case,
<br>
free market or no.  Here is what I'm talking about:  why can't
<br>
poor people afford cheap housing in all the other cities?  Why can't
<br>
relatively primitive houses (along the lines of the 19th century)
<br>
be built by the market place in order to make money by selling them
<br>
or renting them to poor people?  Because governments implement 
<br>
ridiculously elaborate housing codes---not just for certain districts
<br>
in an affluent city---but everywhere they can.  If you think that
<br>
it's a nastly plot by rich people to get richer, well..., I'll agree
<br>
that while there is no conscious conspiracy, every time that we have
<br>
excess government power, the rich will get richer, or else the 
<br>
government will institute socialism and everyone will be poor.
<br>
Repeal all the laws that hurt the poor: minimum wage, uniform building
<br>
codes over a whole state, and so on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't know what part of the country you are living,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but racist behavior has not faded in Seattle, Washington.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And we are considered to be &quot;tolerant,&quot; as cities go ...
</em><br>
<p>Tell me more about it.  How does racism occur in Seattle?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even as de jure segregation went down in flames (literally, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times), I see de facto segregation everywhere (schools, work,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social functions, you name it).  I've been seeing it, I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talked to people who have been affected by it (recently), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it comes in all forms, from subtle to out-there outright.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's cruel and it's unfair.
</em><br>
<p>It happens that not all ethic groups, races, and religious groups
<br>
are equal in all ways.  There really are positive correlations
<br>
between each of crime, race, stupidity, ethnicity, and religious
<br>
group.  That's a fact, and there isn't anything that's going to
<br>
be done about it short term.  The evil of racism is not allowing
<br>
someone's individuality---which really dwarfs whatever groups 
<br>
their in---to dwarf their group membership.  I know of people of 
<br>
every race who are more competant than I am in any area you care
<br>
to choose, and it is important that people be willing to give
<br>
such persons a chance.  I believe that they do, but am eager to
<br>
hear where you think that it's not happening in Seattle.  As
<br>
for de facto segregation, as long as it's people freely choosing,
<br>
then the problem lies elsewhere, and won't be fixed by forced
<br>
busing or forced housing or any other kind of force.
