<p>I am not Canadian so I no doubt do not appreciate all that went
<br>
into this suggestion of immersion of Western Canada into the
<br>
US.  However, I did spent a wonderful six months in 1994 living
<br>
and working in Calgary.  I fell deeply in love with the place
<br>
and the people, even with their -35F occassional extended winter
<br>
temperatures and those crazy fast temperature changes (shinooks?
<br>
or do I miss remember. It isn't in my dictionary).  Both its
<br>
similarities and its differences were quite wonderful.  I made
<br>
more really good friends there in six months than in as many
<br>
years in Silicon Valley.  I honestly have never experienced any
<br>
part of the US that I liked more or felt more at home in.
<br>
<p>So I would hate to see that lost or threatened by such an
<br>
immersion.  It is very good that some places are not US.
