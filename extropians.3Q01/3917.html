</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe you have made a slight mistake in your analysis above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A libertarian society would wish to refuse membership for those who do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not fill their requirement for membership. If a membr of such a society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did not (a) equip and train for armed combat, or (b) pay some police force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; company to do that, that member would simply state its wish to refrain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from defending itself, a somewhat unusual request, but still a perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valid request from any free entity. We should not wish to abridge that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members way to live its life.
</em><br>
<p>I frankly oppose living near individuals who think its fine to outsource
<br>
their self-defense needs. Outsourcing ones self defense is the FIRST and
<br>
greatest step to serfdom. If your right to life is inalienable, the
<br>
responsibility for the individual to defend that life themselves is
<br>
similarly inalienable. Delegation of self-defense is enslavement. This
<br>
is the most important ethic of libertarianism, which many overlook. They
<br>
think 'ooooh, self-ownership is great', but think that the
<br>
responsibilities entailed can be subcontracted. Not so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You stated your wish to live as a member of a corporeal entity, a nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as it were, built on mandatory service to the collective. 
</em><br>
<p>No, I did not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Others may wish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to use the market economy model instead, and hire specialists for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security services. As you do not, it indicates your rightwingedness, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tendency to view your local group as an extended family, instead of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market, which would be the libertarian market economy model.
</em><br>
<p>No, I do not treat my 'local group as a family'. What I say is that your
<br>
right to life cannot be treated as a commodity, by you or anyone else.
