<p>&quot;Suspect&quot;, OK. &quot;Unreliable&quot;, OK. 
<br>
<p>So we can readily see that if some text under examination was written
<br>
by a clever bigot with an axe to grind, it can get under one's radar
<br>
because one is endeavoring to make the words mean what they mean to oneself.
<br>
(&quot;Take it at face value&quot;==&quot;employ 'jackdaw epistemology'&quot;, where 
<br>
&quot;jackdaw epistemology&quot; has been described by Conrad Lorenz as 
<br>
&quot;What I know, all jackdaws know&quot;).
<br>
<p>Jeremy Rifkin has been cited as one whose public face on TV seems eminently
<br>
reasonable; and then one reads his books and discovers just how far out he is.
<br>
<p>Thanks for being diligent in your memetic T-cell efforts. But:
<br>
<p>...does this then mean that words do not mean what they mean?
<br>
<p>...I take it, then. that &quot;right, for the wrong reasons&quot; doesn't
<br>
exist in your way of thinking? Fruit of the poisoned tree, and all that?
<br>
<p>In other words, if a hardcore creationist claims that Newtonian mechanics is due
<br>
to the peculiar psychology of angels pushing planets around, is he incapable of
<br>
producing correct calculations using G*M1*M2/r^2 ?
