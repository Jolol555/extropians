<p><em>&gt; If we are going to be so discriminating, we need to discriminate by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances underwhich you came to know information about me, by what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship of confidence and trust was involved, and individuals must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistently behave in a manner consistent with that trust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, selling web server information about me to anybody while at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same time resisting on 'confidential relationship' grounds against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law enforcement obtaining the same information is logically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconsistent.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what &quot;resisting&quot; you are talking about.  Many will
<br>
perceive a difference between government doing the snooping, at
<br>
public expense, and private parties doing the snooping.  Agreed,
<br>
someone here might be &quot;logically inconsistent&quot;, but I have less
<br>
of a problem with that than the use of force or enactment of
<br>
unnecessary laws (of course).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, a doctor refusing to provide health care information to, say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a minor patient's parents, while at the same time providing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information to sundry government agencies and insurance and drug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies is similarly inconsistent.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe so, but the doctor is within his legal rights to do so,
<br>
and should remain free to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you advertise a privacy policy, there should be legal remedies to its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconsistent application, arbitrary adjustment, or outright abrogation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that those who the information is about have a right to pursue with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningful consequences if the violator is found guilty.
</em><br>
<p>This sounds to me as if you are arguing for &quot;truth in advertizing&quot;.
<br>
Failure to conform with one's publicly made promises is fraud, I
<br>
suppose.  No argument here, if I'm rightly understanding you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One method of dealing with this is to implement actual trust/reputation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brokers that are functional and deal with privacy much as credit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agencies deal with financial responsibility, and lobby the DMA to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require that its members post up-to-the-minute trust ratings on their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privacy policy page.
</em><br>
<p>This is entirely different from what you were talking about
<br>
before.  This has little to do with fraud or violation of 
<br>
laws, and is a commendable free-market solution that doesn't
<br>
impose on anyone's liberties.
