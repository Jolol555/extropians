Longish post! Executive summary: Empathy is an essential interpersonal
<br>
communication skill. More importantly, if you use it, you'll be able
<br>
to anticipate speedbumps on the road to the singularity and steer
<br>
around them. Impatience with other people's current and historical
<br>
suffering is actually going to cost extropians, in the long term.

</em><br>
<p>Bingo.
<br>
<p>(I'm specifically thinking of Mike Lorrey's take on the Jamaican IMF
<br>
loan business -- &quot;well, it's just the market sending them a price signal,
<br>
Wake Up!&quot;, without considering the little problem that developing out of
<br>
a banana economy takes a generation and he's talking about the misery, or
<br>
happiness, of several million people. It's just one example, and I don't
<br>
mean to single Mike out, but it exemplifies the impatience you mention.)
<br>
<p>I think to some extent it's inseparable from extropianism. The low-level
<br>
logic of it is that if you want rapid, exponentiating progress, worrying
<br>
about historical sufferings seems pointless and people flailing around
<br>
in third-world muck seems like an annoying distraction.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, I think to some extent it's self-reinforcing
<br>
group-think, and group-think that can be broken, at that. All it takes
<br>
is for people to step back, once in a while, and question the social
<br>
implications of what they're discussing. Just to maintain awareness.
<br>
<p>In case you -- whoever you are, reading this -- are getting impatient
<br>
with me for suggesting this wishy-washy touchy-feely policy, let
<br>
me give a hypothetical example: take technologies of intelligence
<br>
amplification. We've already got these, to some extent, as Vernor
<br>
Vinge pointed out in his singularity paper: a postgrad student with a
<br>
workstation and a network connection can be far more productive than
<br>
their peer of fifty years ago.
<br>
<p>Let us consider the possibility that intellectual prostheses -- variety
<br>
unspecified, but presumably implants of some kind -- become available some
<br>
time in the next couple of decades. Everyone who can afford one benefits,
<br>
from street-sweeper to uber-genius. Isn't this an unmitigated good?
<br>
<p>Well, only if certain conditions are met. The street sweeper will
<br>
probably still be as far behind the uber-genius as they were before
<br>
the brain implants became available. Absent second-order effects (like:
<br>
people who can think better invent street-sweeping robots) he's still
<br>
a street-sweeper -- only this time, smarter. This isn't necessarily
<br>
a blessing, unless we can find some intellectual equivalent of street
<br>
sweeping to occupy his attention. And this is the good scenario --
<br>
universal access to intelligence amplification. 
<br>
<p>If access isn't universal -- they're too expensive for the poor, for
<br>
example -- then we get increased stratification of society. And we
<br>
have a situation where an uber-genius born into a street sweeper's
<br>
family isn't going to get an implant for a very long time; the barrier
<br>
to social and career mobility has been raised, not lowered. This
<br>
goes for entire societies, so that poor countries begin to fall
<br>
behind en masse, because they can't afford the key technology
<br>
necessary for wealth creation.
<br>
<p>And so on.
<br>
<p>The moral of this little story is that gosh-wow technological innovations
<br>
that appear, in and of themselves, to be beneficial, can have unforseen
<br>
negative consequences. These consequences can be exacerbated by ignoring
<br>
the broad social side-effects of deploying new technologies. (Look at
<br>
the general anti-science backlash catalysed by Monsanto's clumsy attempts
<br>
to deploy roundup-resistant crops and terminator crops, for example.)
