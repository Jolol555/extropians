I just want to say &quot;CONGRATULATIONS!&quot; to Natasha on winning what could be the final round of her battle with cancer.  Due of the fearful challenge she faced and overcame, I have personally found a huge amount of inspiration. 
<br>
<p>I find it quite amazing that her strong focus on weight training may very well have saved her life.  Stage three or four cancer could have stripped her of the muscle tissue it took years to develop.  Or even stripped Natasha of life itself.
<br>
<p>It sounds like she is living the LDS &quot;Word of WIsdom&quot; health code now! lol  If anyone can get good nutritional advice, it would be Natasha.  
<br>
<p>I was amazed how she years ago realized the health hazards in a artist's studio.  Wow!  Her comments on past damage to her body from environmental pollution made me think of the poisons I have been exposed to.  I went to a highschool with asbestos insulation which was taken out while I attended! 
<br>
<p>I have read how positive mental attitude is key to fighting cancer.  Natasha has this factor in her favor!  And also she has a strong marriage with a very supportive mate.  That bodes very well for longevity.
<br>
<p>Many people I think have the image of extropians/transhumanists being &quot;lone wolves,&quot; but Max and Natasha show what a synergistic, and beautiful thing marriage can be between the right people.
<br>
<p>sincerely,
<br>
<p>John
