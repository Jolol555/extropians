&quot;Is it *good* for *me*?&quot; For a number of things in my life I don't

<p>(Here one can reduce the concepts &quot;good&quot; and &quot;me&quot; further into a

<br>
set of values that further my survival and so forth, but I prefer to
<br>
operate my life on simpler principles.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;People have such a strong need to belief such things that one must

</em><br>
<em>&gt;acceptance of the events around her best explained by her
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unconsciously arranging those events to give her what she needs, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by her unconsciously deciding after the fact that whatever happened
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must have been what she needed?
</em><br>
<p>Please allow me to expand further about 'synchronicity', however,
<br>
and maybe I can illuminate the concept.
<br>
<p>The premise in my (and other authors) definition of this
<br>
'synchronicity' is that an objective value exists irrespective of
<br>
whether it is acknowledged by the observer, but the meaning appears
<br>
only when the observer is open to it. One could become mystical
<br>
here, or not, but in my worldview, I often enjoy discovering
<br>
meanings to events in my environment, because it gives me feedback
<br>
or it makes my world richer. But is it my imagination or is it
<br>
really true, you ask?
<br>
<p>If you view synchronicity as a meaningful coincidence between an
<br>
external event and an internal readiness for being aware of that
<br>
event, then synchronicity acts as a bridge to our unconscious mind
<br>
or, at least, to the very edge of our conscious mind. Why is that?
<br>
<p>The unconscious holds a vast collection of events, hopes, memories,
<br>
prejudices, values, unknown to the conscious mind. It's hard work to
<br>
peel back the layers of the onion, and see what is underneath. But
<br>
if those unconscious elements are organizing themselves in various
<br>
ways, then you can reach in and 'touch' it, and bring it to
<br>
awareness. Synchronicity feels a little bit like a &quot;jolt&quot;, because
<br>
you've touched that unconscious element via an occurrence in your
<br>
external world.
<br>
<p>I think that, in order for synchronicity to work, it requires a deep
<br>
trust that the messages from your unconscious mind are strong,
<br>
authentic and move us in the direction of greater wisdom and
<br>
compassion and wholeness. And it absolutely requires one to be
<br>
extremely open and aware of our environment, so that we *know*
<br>
instantly (call it 'intuition') that that event/occurrence has
<br>
importance and we need to pay closer attention to it.
<br>
<p>So then how do we *know* ? That comes from exploring our inner
<br>
mind/world- a place that I believe is just as vast as the outer
<br>
world, and any number of self-knowing tools can be used. You can
<br>
create your own self-knowing tools, or you can  pick up and use
<br>
someone else's. I watch sometimes what the new agers are doing and
<br>
using because they are very interested in discovering what is in
<br>
their psyche, and they have some nifty methods, some of which I find
<br>
very useful, even if I don't buy into all of their premises. I like
<br>
their positive attitudes too. When you explore your inner mind, many
<br>
fuzzy elements travel to the edge of the awareness, and so then
<br>
synchronicity brings it all of the way out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I believe that there is a deep wisdom in my environment, it only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;requires me to be aware of it, to look, to probe, to see, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;understand. ... the environment present around me is also a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;result of processes in the past, and there is a deep wisdom there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;as well. ... being in awe of all things *living*; ... often the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;smallest, most inconsequential things in my environment seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;me to be the most profound: footsteps in sand, the smell of garlic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and onion, hearing children laughing (or crying), and so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I believe that the answers (to any questions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that we have) are *in us* and *around us*. This is one place where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;cultural history and mythology can play an important role. Humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;have experienced and worked out amazing things, and their intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and emotional paths are in front of us, if we *only pay attention*.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Although there is a purely emotive element here, there also seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be a factual claim here as well. So again for me the key question
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is: how *true* is it?
</em><br>
<p>Sometimes, Robin, you just *know*. :-)
<br>
<p>(and sometimes the cause and effect is so deeply buried in
<br>
the unconscious mind, that one can never learn the answer, but
<br>
again.. is it really important?)
<br>
<p>Consider this. Let's take the next step after synchronicity
<br>
(destiny?) and take a look at our larger environment. Let's assume
<br>
that your life is proceeding on a path that seems &quot;right&quot; to you,
<br>
the individual. Wouldn't it be really cool too, if your particular
<br>
path was also beneficial for the world? An alignment of personal and
<br>
universal purposes, in my opinion is the next level of integration
<br>
for someone. That is what being filled with the divine is about and
<br>
I hope that many people here accomplish that. In my small mortal
<br>
way, I'm trying and doing my best.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To me one of the great tragedies of the human condition is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;young largely ignore advice from the old.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.. and also from our *past*. I will have many things to say
<br>
in the future here, regarding old Greek culture and philosophy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Another tragedy is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people are overconfident in their own wisdom relative to that of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other people. So I can share some of Amara's awe in the wisdom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of people around us. But the smell of garlic? I fear that
</em><br>
seeing great wisdom in that is most likely wishful thinking.
<br>
<p>Heh.. I happen to think that the smell of garlic and onion is
<br>
one of the most divine smells in the Universe...
