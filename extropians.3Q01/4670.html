<p><em>&gt; Lee, I'm not sure what your goal is here. Do you just desperately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want Harvey to say &quot;You are right, I am wrong&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  That would be a good start.  I don't have any problem
<br>
admitting it when I'm wrong.  I had to just last night, for
<br>
example.  I just got a little angry when noting the inconsistency
<br>
of his position (as Mike Lorrey also pointed out).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree with you to some extent, in that the Planet of the Abes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article could not have been fraudulent in its presentation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facts.  This because there are no facts presented in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article that I can find, only unsupported assertions.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, most of the article didn't contain statistics, but only
<br>
assertions like
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And some [conservatives] would even revel in the Great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Emancipator portrayed as a brutish, war-mongering sub
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human.  Indeed this was a common caricature of Lincoln
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during the Civil War.  Even today, Lincoln's reputation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; among conservatives remains a source of unending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controversy- as our recent quarrel with Joe Sobran attests.
</em><br>
<p>As I said about this article the other day, it was written
<br>
by a conservatives *for* other conservatives, and does not
<br>
(as I think you rightly imply) have much in it to criticize.
<br>
That indeed was probably the source of Harvey's angst:  since
<br>
it was too shallow, he needed to denounce the site or the
<br>
author instead.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Harvey appears to give him the benefit of the doubt by assuming that these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertions are grounded somewhere in something, rather than just made up off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the top of the author's head. Finding no evidence in the article to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any of the claims, he follows the trail of references, and comes to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusions that he has posted.
</em><br>
<p>Would you mind telling me what assertions or claims that
<br>
you are thinking of?  Here we have once again some hand-
<br>
waving at &quot;claims&quot; and &quot;assumptions&quot; without any particulars.
<br>
(Calmly.  Don't lose your temper again, Lee.)  This is what
<br>
kind of started the argument, or at least *my* argument
<br>
in the first place!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can't see any problem with Harvey's methodology; I am only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprised that he is prepared to put such a lot of effort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into what is, in the end, a rather stupid opinion piece.
</em><br>
<p>Now honestly, Emlyn, I really think that there is some
<br>
asymmetry here.  I do not believe I go around calling
<br>
pieces that I disagree with &quot;stupid&quot;.  I have admitted
<br>
that I would never post such a piece because it didn't
<br>
have enough deep content about which we can (constructively)
<br>
criticize each others' views.  (By the way---I only put in
<br>
that word &quot;constructively&quot; for the newbies who never heard
<br>
of pan-critical rationalism.  They should study the 
<br>
Extropian site, of course.)  But now I'm starting to think
<br>
that Michael Butler's intuition didn't let him down:  the
<br>
piece has brought out some very important principles here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we all spent the time to criticise in detail every piece
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of idiotic editorial on the net, we'd die trying, even giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massive life extension, and no one would benefit from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results.  But that's just my opinion :-P
</em><br>
<p>Oh, you are right of course.  Harvey could have dismissed the
<br>
article in any number of very accurate ways.  Here is what I
<br>
would have said if I were a liberal:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sobran's anti-Lincolnism is wrong because it completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misidentifies the origins of our current occupying army:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i.e., the legions of liberals who, like the apes in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movie, exercise an unnatural dominion over human society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today's liberals don't, of course, look like apes. Indeed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are the beautiful people of our time.  But in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attitudes toward human liberty, the enviro-thug gorillas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chimpanzee professorate, and orangutan feminists do seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost of another species from the men who wrote the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Constitution and Declaration of Independence. 
</em><br>
<p>This highly exaggerated and ad hominem attack on liberals and
<br>
feminists is obviously worthless, and we can charitably suppose
<br>
that this hit piece is only meant to be read by the faithful.
<br>
<p>Or I would have said about
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whatever else he may present in his indictment, Sobran [a fellow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative] cannot attribute to Lincoln the idea that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Constitution was merely an 18th century document, and therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of date; that natural rights were a &quot;fantasy;&quot; that modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life because always changing-required a government that was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always growing; and that &quot;progress&quot; meant there was nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permanently true or right.  But these were precisely the opinions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voiced by the leading American philosophers, journalists, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politicians in the Progressive Movement.  It was John Dewey,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Herbert Croly, and Woodrow Wilson-not Abraham Lincoln-who gave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us the principles and practice of the modern leviathan state.  
</em><br>
<p>(Finally, some meat!)  Well, that may be so! (continues Lee the
<br>
liberal).  Lincoln had no intention of fostering the sort of
<br>
government that really helped people.  He was too mired in the
<br>
century he lived in, and had greater worries anyway.  Indeed,
<br>
the author is correct in saying that progressive government
<br>
was a twentieth century innovation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, can we please put a stop to the ridiculous reposting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of (ridiculous) articles over and over again?  Most here are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not imbeciles, and can follow a thread.
</em><br>
<p>Well, ;-)  *this* imbecile easily loses old posts.  In fact, I
<br>
think that the URL to the original is now stale. (I would have
<br>
posted that instead if I could have.)
<br>
<p>Now it *is* true that some people are very inconvenienced by long
<br>
posts, because of slow download speed or lack of disk space.  I
<br>
do sympathize, and those of us who are not more considerate of
<br>
this problem perhaps should be.  If there are others who have a 
<br>
problem with long posts for either of the two aforesaid reasons,
<br>
or some other technical reason, would you please let me know
<br>
privately?  (<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20Debating%20about%20debating%20and%20&quot;the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Abes&quot;&In-Reply-To=&lt;JEEOJKGAIKFKEHJONHMPAEEGCHAA.lcorbin@tsoft.com&gt;">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>)  I will report on it.
<br>
<p>I assume that you would be equally offended by a repost of a
<br>
long (though nebulous) article that you happened to agree with.
<br>
<p>Lee
