<em>&gt; Actually Im not sure if that fits the definition of learning from its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistakes, exactly.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Be that as it may, the intermediate steps that allow us to build the UIM seem
<br>
more clear than any military program that promises to supercede the MAD
<br>
position. Add to this that once built, the UIM will be the last thing humans
<br>
need ever build, and it appears counterproductive to spend time (especially
<br>
computer time) on any other projects (except for debunking religiosity, which
<br>
could buy more time by preventing fanatics starting another global war).
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
