<p><em>&gt; &gt; So I would say that your quest to get rid of religiosity would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to in fact ignore religiosity and focus your efforts on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assisting a drive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for species-wide transcendence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, if only fanatics and zealots would quit getting into everyone's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business.
</em><br>
<p>Quite. Never said it'd be a simple juggling act :) But focus everything on
<br>
stopping the religious, and they &quot;win.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, here's a related bit from SL4:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;Michael Korns coined the tern 'inloading' at Extro5 for the approach of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adding artificial neurons to live humans to upgrade them. He sees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inloading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a more likely, and preferable path to human super-intelligence. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incremental, and less shocking than uploading - and will probably also be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easier to achieve.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Inloading involves gradually adding silicon/ nanotube/ quantum?! (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever) artificial neurons &amp; connection to our brains, together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology to transmit all relevant information to an external
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backup. Eventually, artificial neurons would vastly outnumber
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original ones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I like the meme: inloading - less threatening than uploading. 'Simply'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the enhancement of brain function, but ultimately the same result.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's the best new idea I've read this year.
</em><br>
<p>I've seen this talked about before, but more in the &quot;human welded to big
<br>
computer as transition stage to becoming big computer&quot; sense. As postulated
<br>
above -- no big computer, gradual, still looking human -- it's a very
<br>
logical and attractive end-conclusion for the discussion, with nice
<br>
parallels to the organic way in which we tend to &quot;grow&quot; our home computers
<br>
at the moment. Giving it a catchy name is good (&quot;inloading&quot; definately
<br>
sounds better than &quot;loading up&quot; :). Insofar as the wider stage goes,
<br>
concepts don't really exist until they have widely adopted, catchy names. So
<br>
everyone who maintains a site should add this definition up there and
<br>
propagate the meme.
<br>
<p>Hell, I'd lay down a challenge to see if we can get an article on inloading
<br>
into abcnews.com's science section. Seems like the sort of thing they'd go
<br>
for, and all it would take is a speculative science paper handed to the
<br>
right people. The editors there got four days worth of space out of the
<br>
biotech super soldier stuff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Although I do think that removing aging as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more do-able first step would greatly mitigate one of the larger factors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; driving the formation and evolution of organized religions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep, a good place to begin... before our brains succumb to a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generation of religionists.
</em><br>
<p>You make them sound like B-movie zombies :)
<br>
<p>Although; semantics. Religionists are fine. It's religionists (and others --
<br>
some economists fall into this category) that happen to be missionary
<br>
luddites and/or deathists that are problematic.
