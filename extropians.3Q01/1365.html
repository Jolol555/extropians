<em>&gt;A quick response to your point of bank deregulation: The biggest disaster

<em>&gt;in Australian banking was when our government of idiots swallowed that

</em><br>
<em>&gt;the banks have been closing local branches everywhere, and they have been

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Much the same thing happened here a decade or so ago--we're still
<br>
paying for it, I think.  They never remember....what's old is new
<br>
again, when it comes to propaganda.....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes, yes, you think I am saying &quot;bad capitalism&quot;, but I ain't.  :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Government was originally formed (if I remember my history correctly) to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;give the population some way to control the powerful individuals (lords, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kings, and barons) that oppressed people. Of course, government can step 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into those same nasty shoes and can be just as dangerous to the people. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. It doesn't matter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if that power is in the hands of government, or big companies, or powerful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individuals. It all comes to the same thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We have a new religion taking hold around the world at the moment that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;convinces people to let the most powerful companies and individuals rule 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the planet unopposed in the name of &quot;market forces&quot;. People are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indoctrinated, perversely, to relinquish all control with faith that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invisible hand of the market will balance all things. 
</em><br>
<p>I think you have it exactly right!  I sure am glad that someone else
<br>
here  sees it this way.  The first thing we can do here in America
<br>
about this situation is to rewrite the Constitution, writing into it
<br>
the acknowledgement of this NATURAL AXIOM --the stronger will
<br>
generally attempt to exploit and oppress the weaker, whether it be the
<br>
upper income strata, or those with power in gov't.  The exception
<br>
being of course the occasional &quot;altruism&quot;--that really being nothing
<br>
but the occasional self-gratification.....
<br>
<p>&nbsp;And furthermore, the constitution should acknowledge that a country
<br>
is owned by and should therefore be operated so as to benefit the
<br>
majority of its citizen-owners.
