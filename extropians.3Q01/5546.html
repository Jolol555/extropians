<p>I'm currently involved in a start-up that's in its fund raising cycle
<br>
at present. (Last years' was a failure; it's a bad idea to try to
<br>
start a software company that needs US $900K of seed capital in the 
<br>
middle of a market crash. We had two VC's declare their undying
<br>
love for us, pledge their all ... then go bankrupt before said funds
<br>
appeared in our bank account. But I digress ...)
<br>
<p>Here in the UK, pay stratification is a hot-button news topic -- &quot;fat
<br>
cat&quot; bosses are not popular, especially when their fat pay awards are
<br>
combined with pay freezes lower down the organisational ladder, not to
<br>
mention big losses and redundancies. 
<br>
<p>Following a couple of enquiries over the past decade, something called
<br>
the combined code has emerged -- combined from the Cadbury code and
<br>
the Greenberg committee code. It's not legislated, but a company that
<br>
wants to go public on the London stock exchanges needs to be compliant
<br>
with it or investors will be less than enthusiastic and some brokerages
<br>
will refuse to underwrite them. The combined code is fairly simple:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;* The job of the directors/managers is to run a corporation for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the benefit of the shareholders
<br>
<p>&nbsp;* Directors cannot and must not set their own pay
<br>
<p>&nbsp;* Non-executive directors may be elected who will be responsible
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for setting the pay of executive directors
<br>
<p>&nbsp;* Executive directors can set the remuneration of the non-executive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;directors
<br>
<p>This isn't 100% satisfactory -- it permits back-scratching -- but it
<br>
ensures that the appointment of the people who set the executives' pay
<br>
must be voted on at the corporation AGM, which gives the shareholders
<br>
a way to express their displeasure.
<br>
<p>I'd be happier if it was a three-level indirection -- i.e., there
<br>
was a third category (pay set by the non-execs, their job being to
<br>
set up the execs, also subject to veto by shareholders) in the loop
<br>
to prevent cronyism. But it seems to have controlled some of the worst
<br>
excesses. Note that I say &quot;seems&quot;; latest word is that the rich/poor
<br>
income gap in the UK has widened considerably under the Blair government.
<br>
<p>(In case anyone out there still thinks Tony Blair is a socialist, it's
<br>
kind of hard to reconcile socialism with social elitism -- and he's much
<br>
more into the latter than the former.)
