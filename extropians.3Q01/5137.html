<p><p><em>&gt;I entirely agree, and thank you for pointing that out. In contrast to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capitalism, one might consider the educational benefits of socialism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;especially famous socialist teachers such as Stalin, who taught 30,000,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people how to die, or National Socialist Adolph Hitler who graduated tens 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;millions in his special education classes. Then there was the Maoist brand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;socialist education that taught many more millions of  students how to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;starve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to death..
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Responsible and intelligent people should always remember the lessons that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;socialism teaches.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think anyone here is advocating socialism.  I certainly am not.  But 
<br>
there are alternatives other than unregulated markets on one hand and 
<br>
totalitarian socialist regimes on the other.  Though die hard libertarians 
<br>
will disagree, free enterprise mixed with a spoonful of socially responsible 
<br>
regulation can go a long way.
<br>
<p>Unrestrained capitalism (think early industrial US) leads to huge 
<br>
discrepancies in the distribution of wealth, which leads to social unrest 
<br>
(think the early labor movement) and even upheaval (think French 
<br>
Revolution).
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
