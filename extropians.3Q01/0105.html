<p><em>&gt; If you haven't already seen the movie you might not want to read the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This continues to be true.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><em>&gt; There are times when death is preferable to life, like an eternal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life full of misery and ugliness and pain, the very definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; David's life in the movie. If that's what you mean by &quot;deathist&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then I'm a deathist and proud of it.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is what I mean.  Isn't this always the reason people
<br>
give for wanting to die?  I think there is room to hope that something
<br>
better than this is possible.  Giving up, thinking there can't be
<br>
anything better, and dieing is certainly, to me anyway, not a good
<br>
thing.  But telling other people they can't do this or think this way
<br>
is much worse.  Everyone must chose for themselves and be respected
<br>
for such.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't know what you're talking about.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, my opinions of how the future of consciousness will
<br>
unfold is still very much in the minority view.  So this is only a
<br>
problem I, personally, have with the movie (and much of the talk on
<br>
this list like this and almost everywhere else about the future of
<br>
consciousness for that matter.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The movie asks for no more than what every other movie has asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since the invention of photography, that you form an opinion of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inner subjective state of a screen character by observing the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the character behaves. Come to think of it, that's exactly what we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do with real characters not just movie characters.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is precisely the problem I am talking about.  Just
<br>
because we have never been able to do anything more than this in the
<br>
past in no way proves we will never be able to do something
<br>
drastically different in the future.  As long as our subjective
<br>
knowledge is trapped within our skulls in such a hard wired and fixed
<br>
way, as long as we can't eff the ineffable..., this will continue to
<br>
be a problem.  But once we discover what conscious awareness is really
<br>
made of and where it is located, once we reverse engineer it....  we
<br>
will develop the ability to eff the ineffable, redesign our conscious
<br>
representations so it becomes more intuitive, make it possible for our
<br>
subjective worlds to grow, expand, and escape the walls that are our
<br>
skull, to merge and share conscious experience...  Once we can do all
<br>
this, the world will be drastically different and nothing like it was
<br>
before this, or in movies like this.  And just one small part of those
<br>
drastic differences will be that we will no longer be left with only:
<br>
&quot;form an opinion of the inner subjective state of a screen character
<br>
by observing the way the character behaves.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Why would an android have to go to talk to &quot;Dr. Know&quot; like he did?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Surely he would be able to, if he didn't already have it - purchase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and install a direct interface into the world of all internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; knowledge
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Unfair! If you know how to depict that on screen in a visually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting manner then you're in the wrong line of work, you should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be making movies.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahhh!  Good point!  And this probably goes for everything I am
<br>
saying.  They even had difficulties portraying the fact that the final
<br>
scene of David in his old house was a virtually real house, not an
<br>
actual physical reconstruction.  I'm sure even with this many people
<br>
missed this point.  But thank goodness they at least tried with this
<br>
with some amount of success for those that really understand what
<br>
virtual reality is.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when it comes to effing, expanding our subjective worlds
<br>
of conscious awareness, merging and sharing subjective worlds....
<br>
there is no way (that I know of) to portray anything like this in
<br>
film.  In fact, it's damn near impossible to communicate anything like
<br>
this to others at all, even with months and months of argumentative
<br>
philosophical discussions and a strong desire by others to try to
<br>
understand it.  By definition, one cannot YET eff the ineffable.  We
<br>
just do not YET have the conscious machinery required to intuitively
<br>
and consciously know things like our conscious knowledge is not
<br>
reality itself, but only our knowledge of reality.  And without even
<br>
this how can we hope to describe what it might be like to share this
<br>
subjective awareness with others.  But with a little practice, desire,
<br>
and work, even with our still limited minds, it is possible to realize
<br>
much of this - even if only cognitively and non intuitively.  And
<br>
everything about consciousness makes so much more sense once one has
<br>
achieved this - at least it seems this way to me - since this theory
<br>
is after all only accepted by a very small minority.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, so maybe it was a better movie than my initial
<br>
impressions!??
<br>
.

<br>
Nawww, I think I'd rather be dead than to have to watch that
<br>
depressing movie (or hold that view of life) for an eternity! ;)
