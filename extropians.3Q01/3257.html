</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; case, and I don't want to look weak, so I'll skip that one.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When we evaluate someone (or group) totally on their ideology, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to miss important features that shape their decisions.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's the ideology (i.e., ideals) that they want us to notice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (usually).
</em><br>
<p>This is what primarily defines the ACLU. You would think that after US
<br>
v. Verdugo-Urquidez that they'd get a clue and actually defend
<br>
individuals second amendment rights to the same degree they defend the
<br>
first amendment rights of individuals (i.e. just as their standard is
<br>
'we defend not the speech we find acceptable, but that which we find
<br>
unacceptable', but saying 'we defend not your right to keep and bear
<br>
arms we like, but those we abhor').
<br>
<p>Your argument about winnability doesn't hold. For example, the US v.
<br>
Emerson case has been won significantly at the district court level, and
<br>
handicappers are betting Emerson will also win at the appeals level,
<br>
with arguments that are on the same level as Roe v Wade and the Skokie
<br>
case.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the ACLU seems to be caving in more to political
<br>
correctness, since it seems to be generally absent in the recent case of
<br>
a fellow convicted for pedophilic fictional writing in a private
<br>
journal. (Note: if this case stands, people writing in the manner of
<br>
Robert A Heinlein's later works would find themselves convicted of
<br>
pedophilia).
