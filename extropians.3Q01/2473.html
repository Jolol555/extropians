Can anyone confirm what one discussant on our BCPOLITICS list said last
<br>
year...That slavery in the US is not illegal, even today?

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; or that I was defending it, or that I myself denied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it existed.   Good grief.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; You never met anyone so ignorant of history?

<em>&gt; Oh no!  Even though *she* was the one to bring up

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the fact that not many

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people are aware of this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (because, of course, everyone does know this, i.e.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;whites profited from UNPAID slave labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for hundreds of years&quot;).  Duh!  Well what does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slavery mean?  (Gee!  I hope that that isn't
</em><br>

<em>&gt; it was Olga who was doubting that I knew it, but
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You think I'm exaggerating?  No!  She really 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concluded from the above, that I was saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she was ignorant of the history (of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that makes zero sense, since it was she who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; described all that about who built the White
</em><br>
<em>&gt; House, etc.).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; She continues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Lee, dearest, do you remember just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; couple of days ago, when you were telling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me that &quot;It really would be best for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; concerned to avoid personal references
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Olga, can you believe that I wasn't, really, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really, really, wasn't referring to you???
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You also wrote about the importance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;confin[ing] oneself to careful argument.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And you didn't do that, either.  Dear,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; oh dear - what am I going to do with you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, but I did.  You (for some unknown reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; took personally what clearly did not apply to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;You wrote:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; It's usually put forth as the reason that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Civil War was fought, &quot;to free the slaves&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Abraham Lincoln is probably best known &quot;for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; freeing the slaves.&quot;   Okay :-)  maybe you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; didn't hear this growing up because you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; weren't here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I meant, was literal (as usual).  Namely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that although you undoubtedly learned the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historical facts a long time ago (or have done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a very good job recently), you perhaps didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand that everyone learns about Abraham
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lincoln in elementary school here.  And in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; middle school. And in high school.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You probably thought that this was yet another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slam:  that I was implying (I am not) that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply didn't know about this period.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If Thomas Sowell says that racism doesn't exist in the U.S.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; he's lying ... if that's what he says ...).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; By no means does he say such a thing!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Lee, I didn't say Sowell says such a thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it's customary to clear any innocent third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; party's name in these discussions.  To make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **perfectly** clear to any other reader the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true nature of some prominent person's views.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's why I wrote the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;IF&quot; up there a couple of times.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't be so sensitive.  Again, you were reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implications where they did not belong.  I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly what &quot;IF&quot; means.  (Maybe I should have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said, &quot;For your information, Thomas Sowell...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.&quot;)  But no, there is a way to mis-read that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too.  I give up.
