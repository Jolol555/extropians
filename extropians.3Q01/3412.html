<p><em>&gt; What makes you think we don't have better things to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than have our emotional control and objectivity taxed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the moment?
</em><br>
<p>Who said I think that?  I have said any number of times that
<br>
(a) people's tastes vary, (b) some have too little time (c)
<br>
some people are so disgusted by any discussion pertaining
<br>
to racism, homophobia, or sexism and simply choose to stay
<br>
away, and so on.  I meant no criticism of any of those people.
<br>
<p>My criticism is of those who want to throw incidiary accusations
<br>
at others, but who don't want to discuss whether or not it is
<br>
wise to do so, under what conditions one ought to do so, and
<br>
so on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you really think that no one would want to forgo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things like the original post on here for some other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason beyond just being unconfortable? 
</em><br>
<p>No.  There are many reasons one might want to forego reading
<br>
or discussing anything (including Fred Reed's piece).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Where is your objectivity when it comes to a balanced view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your list siblings?
</em><br>
<p>Would you please point out where I do not have a &quot;balanced 
<br>
view of my list siblings&quot;?  Your vague implications here
<br>
aren't very easy to contend with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you the pot calling the kettle black when it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes to failing in objectivity and assuming the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse about others when they don't want to play?
</em><br>
<p>Can you give me an example where I appear to be the
<br>
pot calling the kettle black?  I admit to failing to
<br>
be objective at times; we all do from time to time.
<br>
I wished to be called on it when I'm not.  But those
<br>
efforts *must* be accompanied by adequate references
<br>
to what was actually said.  Here, for example, I have
<br>
no good idea what you are talking about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The worst thing that I can say about the act of *posting*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; such an  article is that it is in poor taste insofar as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; many of the lurkers are concerned.  (I'll defend that thesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; some other time.)  But for extropians, it is obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; exactly what is needed, and the 800 lurkers have to gear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; up to the level of perspicacious analysis plain speaking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that often occurs here. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You might believe it is exactly what is needed but many here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree.  I think that it is a pretty ham-fisted way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploring the problems of objectivity in discussions if that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is your primary purpose.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry.  I can't think of any better way.  If people truly want
<br>
to understand how difficult it is to keep their tempers and
<br>
their objectivity, then discussing us and our reactions to
<br>
someone's EXTREMELY controversial post is an *excellent*
<br>
starting point.  What better way can you think of.  (Thanks.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If we cannot learn how to be objective and calm with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ideas that disturb *us*, then how are we to approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; telling others about Jupiter brains, uploading, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the singularity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One can be utterly objective and calm and still say, &quot;I am not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in discussing thus and such subject right now or in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endless analysis of the motivations and sub-motivations of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made the discussion to date what it was or was not.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  And one can even not attend to the discussion at
<br>
all.  If you wish simply to express disapproval of the participants,
<br>
or of the original poster, or of some of the arguments that people
<br>
have made, well, it's a free list, so go ahead.  But I think that
<br>
it is far better---especially if you want to contribute something---
<br>
to meet others arguments with rational counter-arguments, not 
<br>
complain about the existence of those arguments.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Nonsense.  This is yet another symptom of the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you are made very uncomfortable by the possibility that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; while not literally correct, the essay delves into &quot;areas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that people were not meant to discuss&quot;.&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee, you need a vacation.  Seriously.  Nothing is more boringly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needlesome than a rehash of a contentious disagreement.  
</em><br>
<p>You are bored, so I need a vacation?  :-)  Well, thanks very
<br>
much for the advice.  I appreciate people with my own best
<br>
interest in mind (this is not a joke, this is not sarcasm),
<br>
and I'll consider it.  Considering your best interests in
<br>
mind, in order to repay you the favor, I think that you might
<br>
consider not attending to threads that are boring, or to
<br>
posters that bore you a lot.
<br>
<p>Lee
