<em>&gt; &gt;Lovely, wave been reduced to the insane point now where our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;disavow philosophy. Our ideals are that we hold no ideals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that philosophy doesn't matter could only be grasped by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brutes. They focus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;on the concrete and forgo the conceptual level. Exactly how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you define
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;human life as a value without a philosophy when its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy that tells
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you what IS in fact valuable? You cannot escape the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requirement to possess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;one... what you can do is default on your requirement for a rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;philosophy and just drift where the winds take you. This is the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;commonly chosen path. This is why someone with a integrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view of reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;seems so alien or dare I use the word &quot;radical&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ideas that matter more than people are not worth holding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Philosophies that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let you consider people en-masse and minimise their humanity lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atrocities. The destruction of the poor souls at the WTC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shows that clearly.
</em><br>
<p>Any philosophy that defaults on defending itself deserve what it gets. If
<br>
the Mongol hordes are breaking down your door and you DONT consider them
<br>
en-masse, guess what comes next.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have convictions in the normal sense.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. that takes an integrated view of existence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For me, life is valued above all else, next most important to me is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, and the third thing I hold dear is knowledge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I start from these simply because it seems to me the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical thing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do.
</em><br>
<p>And no clue why or how to explain &quot;why&quot; you hold certain things in a
<br>
particular value, or discover the roots of these thoughts, or in fact check
<br>
their validity (not saying they aren't noble, but WHY is the question).
<br>
What's logical? Is there truth? What entails a fact? Your getting
<br>
dangerously close if you just asked a few more questions to the source of
<br>
these lines of thinking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't believe in moral absolutes. I see punishment as sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;working&quot;, but other times counterproductive. Everything is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluated in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eyes by how it can enhance life, intelligence, and knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>How can you judge anything as good or bad when you just said there are no
<br>
absolutes? In the spectrum of morality, what's wrong with occupying the
<br>
&quot;right&quot; side.... Who benefits from a compromise between evil and good?
<br>
(Hint, the good is already good)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Calling for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; senseless revenge pretty clearly runs counter to all three. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't repeat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reasons. [sigh]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The inability to tell the difference between revenge and removal of a threat
<br>
is only possible without clear definitions, clarity of action, and intense
<br>
scrutiny of the facts. If someone rapes your beloved and then comes back for
<br>
more, you are most certainly protecting your loved ones as you should when
<br>
you kill them. If he posed no further threat and we still wanted to kill
<br>
him, then you could classify it as revenge, although I would call it justice
<br>
myself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This isn't at all what history has shown. Where were all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorist from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Japan, Germany, or Korea? Historical precedence says that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when a country is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;beaten down, for the most part, they shut up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True, but you are wanting to fight a totally different beast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no simple, centralised monster. This something that if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lop off one head
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many more spring up to take its place. A different tactic is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is more like the war with Vietnam.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So where were the Vietnamese terrorist then?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Damn strait I'm a fanatic for liberty and proud of it. Ill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fight to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;death to preserve it as well, for myself and my children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately it looks like you will just be guaranteeing that your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children will have to deal with the fallout from your desire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revenge.
</em><br>
<p>See above for a description for the difference between revenge and justice
<br>
or protection. Without me acting, they most certainly WILL have to deal with
<br>
them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I'm sure everyone here that's spouting against violence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feels morally smug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;thinking there's never a time for violence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course there is a time for violence. But it is just not *always*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; productive, and certainly shouldn't be the standard kneejerk response.
</em><br>
<p>Remember, you don't have a philosophy so your in no position to determine
<br>
anything. Without values and convictions as to what is a value, your once
<br>
again lost in a moral morass incable of determining right from wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I for one think that people that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;don't have the strength to define a philosophy and defend it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cowards. I for one don't agree with the philosophy of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; middle east, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;at least they have the balls to have one. There is no way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that man can exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;without an integrated world view... a philosophy. This moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agnosticism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;worse by far though. At least their view has a relationship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to reality...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;their wrong. The fog of the unknowable ether inhabited by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the anti-idealist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;has no relationship to anything. Its free to twist, contort,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and dispense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;with its views at whim. The misguided Arabs will eventually have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;possibility to correct their thinking by correlating it with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;will be no such chance for the anti-idealist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh great. Calling for thoughtful, measured response that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; takes into account
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past and future actions makes me more reprehensible than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dumb shits who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altered your skyline so dramatically by succumbing to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illusion of quick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fix via violence. :-(
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jerry, it feels strange to hear you aligning yourself with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fanatics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while denouncing someone who would like to find long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cycle of spilt blood.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;          - Miriam
</em><br>
<p>Oh I never said they weren't dangerous, but they haven't been exposed to a
<br>
rational philosophy and therefore at least have an excuse as to their
<br>
ignorance. Its those great thinkers that have heard of it and turned it down
<br>
that are worse. The anti-idealist is the anti-reason, because reason demands
<br>
that you understand reality and its nature. The anti-idealist has chosen to
<br>
ignore their own reason and go off into the fields of their own internal
<br>
murky whims and desires without the slightest clue why the world isn't
<br>
working the way they demand. Just drop philosophy, drop reason, drop this
<br>
crazy notion there is in fact a correct way to live in this world.
<br>
Just sit back, sing cum-by-ya and everything will be peachy.
<br>
<p>I have no dought that you want to find the answers, but if you cant even
<br>
validate you own ideas, and rely on some instinct that just &quot;tells you that
<br>
its seems logical&quot;, then I don't know how you'll answer the hordes coming
<br>
over the walls when they point to you and say your wrong. If you took a
<br>
fraction of the time verifying the logical consistency of your belief
<br>
structure, making sure its consistent, complete, and rational, as you
<br>
probably do your normal work issues, and you'll be able to see there IS a
<br>
structure to reality. Man must produce to live, he must think to produce, he
<br>
must choose to think... Its all within the grasp of any human if they really
<br>
want to try and look at it. If your really concerned for the future, you'll
<br>
help man understand reality, not tell him that its unknowable, that
<br>
absolutes aren't real, that morality is fiction. Undermining his mind is in
<br>
fact more evil then any bomb, its a guarantee at his final destruction.
