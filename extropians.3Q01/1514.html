There are a number of libertarians, like Daniel Ust and Brian
<br>
Williams, who claim that it is absolutely morally wrong for
<br>
governments to forcibly take money from citizens. Rafal Smigrodski
<br>
put it this way:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; namely, isn't it morally wrong to take money under duress,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (the IRS), ultimately backed by a threat of death, to pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for other persons' life-saving procedures? I would say it depends.
</em><br>
<p>When all is said and done, I would probably agree that yes, it *is*
<br>
morally wrong, and that this is an extremely high concern.
<br>
<p>However, the real reason that I oppose government confiscation
<br>
of the wealth of the prudent to finance the needs of those whose
<br>
lives haven't worked out for some reason, is evolutionary:
<br>
Approving of government to pay for everyone's health care, for
<br>
example, seem to me unappreciative of how wealth is created in
<br>
the first place.  Specifically, there seems to be little awareness
<br>
necessary attributes of all those societies that in the past
<br>
gradually became wealthy.
<br>
<p>Let us suppose that in the Constitution of &quot;the first new nation&quot;,
<br>
i.e., the United States, there had been a provision for a minimal
<br>
guaranteed annual income.  Isn't it clear that many people would
<br>
have lost the incentive to contribute?  As it was, there were a
<br>
number of people who were too lazy, or too wasteful, or lacking
<br>
in other positive traits.  But they didn't thrive and people didn't
<br>
look up to them or accept them, and as a result the traditions that
<br>
*did* survive were positive ones.  I'm always surprised at the
<br>
&quot;no fear&quot; attitude of liberals who don't appear---under a lot of
<br>
cases---to understand how historically important *incentive*
<br>
has been in people's lives.
<br>
<p>Later, when our world economy has become so strong that it no longer
<br>
matters whether everyone is guaranteed an income of $100,000 or not,
<br>
then I will be much less concerned about destroying the traditions
<br>
of personal responsibility that took so many centuries to evolve.
