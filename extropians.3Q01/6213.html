</em><br>
<em> &gt; crisis in the Levant.  Examples can be found from Algeria
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to Indonesia that have nothing to do with Palestinian
</em><br>
<em> &gt; nationalism.  That culture of fanaticism has secured the

<em> &gt; &quot;sacred high ground&quot; throughout the Islamic world.  As a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; result, there is no secure
</em><br>
<p><p>This seems to me to have been true since the ??1400's?? when the
<br>
a conflict between fundamentalist factions destroyed what had
<br>
until then been the world's leading culture.  They don't seem to
<br>
have recovered since, so I tend to consider whatever it is that
<br>
they are believing evil, without even looking at it closely.
<br>
The effects are just so obvious (from a distance) that the
<br>
details of the reasoning aren't important.  (Unless you think
<br>
you can create a cure.)
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt; middle ground in politics or culture in the Islamic world.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; This is because Islamism is truly totalitarian, or
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;culturally hegemonistic,&quot; to borrow a phrase form Marxist
</em><br>
<em> &gt; rhetoric, i.e. it makes claim to relevance to and dominance
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  over every aspect of life.  Contrary to the claims of 
</em><br>
Arab-Americans
<br>
<em> &gt;  and others today, and in the days that follow, that the 9/11/01
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  attacks don't represent &quot;true Islam&quot;, in fact they do.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; They represent precisely the aspects of Islam that made it
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the most successfully viral meme in human history.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<p>That's not a sufficient explantion.  The theological governments
<br>
of the middle ages made the same claim, but fell because the
<br>
claim wasn't accepted with sufficient strength to maintain
<br>
against secular seeking for advantage.  It still lingers in the
<br>
formal obesiances that the politicians all make to this or that
<br>
religion or religious organization.  (Consider the stem cell
<br>
problem.)  But in &quot;christendom&quot; it's relatively minor.
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt; And herein lies the ultimate, gut-wrenching irony and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; threat: Our political and cultural leaders cannot condemn
</em><br>
<em> &gt; this root cause of the problem.  On the
</em><br>
<p><em> &gt; one hand, it would likely be ineffective.  Condemnation of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Islamism would be interpreted by Moslems all over the world
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  as the simple rhetoric of
</em><br>
<p>Ineffective is the key problem. If it were effective, I doubt 
<br>
that there would be any hesitation over the niceties.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; inter-religious bigotry and ompetition.  In other words,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; condemning Islam for what it is would be heard by Moslems
</em><br>
<em> &gt; as the same kind of rhetoric that has fueled
</em><br>
<em> &gt; inter-religious wars throughout history, no different than
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the kind of pronouncements made by leaders on both sides of
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  the European religious wars of the Reformation.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure that wouldn't be the lesser of evils. 
<br>
Unfortunately, I suspect that it would get considerably worse 
<br>
than that.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; On the other hand, the modern dogma of cultural relativism
</em><br>
<em> &gt; makes any kind of public judgment of one culture by another
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  impossible.  Any condemnation of Islam for the fertilizer
</em><br>
<p>That's not what cultural relativitism means.  That may be the 
<br>
&quot;newspaper popularization&quot; of what it means.  But what's 
<br>
actually going on is that people don't generally want to exert 
<br>
themselves and put themselves into danger without good reason. 
<br>
The government of late hasn't been giving many good reasons for 
<br>
trusting it, much less supporting it in a large effort.  In 
<br>
fact, to some extent I suspect this whole event of being staged, 
<br>
or at least of being the result of background agent 
<br>
provacateurs.  If it were, I'd have no way of knowing.  If this 
<br>
is the first act, and it was staged by background agents, then 
<br>
what would the expected second act be?  And what would be the 
<br>
goal?  FDR conned the Japanese into attacking us.  I doubt that 
<br>
the current Bush would be that subtle, but his father well 
<br>
might.  Right now a few hot-heads are talking about war, wiping 
<br>
(insert enemy here) off the face of the earth, etc.  A few more 
<br>
moves, and who knows where it could lead...
<br>
<p>We don't know.  We can't know.  We are systematically lied to. 
<br>
Usually the system is designed to sell us things, or support 
<br>
politicians.  But there are other (allied) possibilities.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; of fanaticism that it is would be interpreted by the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; shapers of our own culture as chauvinism.  Thus, our public
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  discourse is condemned to a fundamental impotence: We
</em><br>
<em> &gt; cannot as a civilization even TALK about the root cause of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the problem.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I wish I could offer a solution . . .

Johnson pushed us into Viet Nam.  Regan pushed us into Panama 
<br>
and Grenada.  Was it Bush senior who tried to push us into 
<br>
Nicaragua?  Why should the Bush be exempt from suspicion.
<br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
And, of course, various groups have gone out of their way to 
<br>
declare themselves our enemies.  Most of the time it's been 
<br>
posturing, but how would we, as opposed to our government, know 
<br>
if it were real?  And always some groups within the countries 
<br>
have believed it was real.  This didn't really need a large 
<br>
support system.  So it could be the action of a small group 
<br>
without real support from anywhere else.  It's possible that 
<br>
nearly everyone else thought it was normal grandstanding.
