Some thoughts way ahead of time...
<br>
<p>Many interesting things have come from out-of-control emotions -- many of 
<br>
them bad, but some good -- as immortals we will be tempted to eliminate 
<br>
these dangers to our sanity... certainly I shall. I want to extend my mind 
<br>
to let me see and understand time like some of my friends do and be able to 
<br>
have better numeracy skills.
<br>
<p>I am aware of the danger that depression in particular can pose, and may 
<br>
want to modify my slight tendency to that frame of mind. I very rarely get 
<br>
depressed. Unlike most people that I know, I'm optimistic almost all the 
<br>
time, but I do have rare fits of quite deep depression. It follows that if 
<br>
I live for hundreds, thousands, millions of years, if I don't have the 
<br>
depression thing patched then sooner or later I will experience a deep 
<br>
enough depression to cause me to break the slender thread which is my life. 
<br>
Ok, so fix that... end of problem. But one thing about that bothers me. 
<br>
Some of my best drawings have been done whilst in the grip of despair. It 
<br>
induces a strangely detached mind-set. If I eliminate that emotion then I 
<br>
eliminate its artistic benefits.
<br>
<p>One of my best pictures was done while withdrawing from drug use decades 
<br>
ago. I was incredibly angry and intolerant of everybody and everything 
<br>
around me -- hardly the kind of frame of mind that I would want for the 
<br>
future, but if I eliminate that &quot;madness&quot; then I eliminate its 
<br>
possibilities. Unbalancing the mind can have some strange side-benefits 
<br>
(think Van Gogh, Robert Downey Jr, Aaron Sorkin, Coleridge, Philip K. 
<br>
Dick). The danger of course is of being trapped in a self perpetuating loop 
<br>
-- getting stuck in that dangerous mind-set. Then we become a danger to 
<br>
ourselves and those around us.
<br>
<p>How do we minimise the dangers, but allow for the benefits to be explored?
<br>
<p>Death from depression or accident is the simplest to solve (in concept 
<br>
anyway). Make regular backups of your mind, and ensure that the most recent 
<br>
backup is activated upon your current self's death. If a history of backups 
<br>
are kept then even if the next backup suffers the same fate then the prior 
<br>
backup will be activated, and so on till one is run which survives.
<br>
<p>The madness loop is harder to define, let alone solve. It is hard to see 
<br>
how circular memes could be solved for, but emotional frames of mind that 
<br>
are brought about by certain mixes of hormones could be. I can imagine a 
<br>
guardian angel program watching hormonal levels (the hormones would be 
<br>
simulated of course) and rebalancing them forcibly if they got stuck in a 
<br>
dangerous loop that lasted too long.
<br>
<p>Anyway... just some food for thought...
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
