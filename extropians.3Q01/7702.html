<p>For starters, I'd suggest starting slowly ratcheting up nonrenewable

nondomestic energy prices (making it all initially slow, very sustained
<br>
and predictable, so you could forecast markup on a decade scale),
<br>
allocating the skimmed taxes entirely to the solar
<br>
hydrogen/methanol/photovoltaics (mostly terrestrial but also solar sats)
<br>
program plus supplementing them with funds drained from other sources. I'd
<br>
pass new building codes requiring extra insulation (not forgetting minimal
<br>
air exchange rates, as recirculated air tends to get loaded with toxic
<br>
crap) and maximal/minimal temperatures if heating energy comes from

nonrenewable nondomestic sources.

<p>I would dump above raw list and state that this is just an outline, as

real research and modelling needs to be done to make the transition as

painless as possible. And, of course, to reverse the amound of dirigism

after you're done. Last but not least.
