<p>Now more than ever
<br>
Witnessing hell has made me a born-again atheist.

<p>Sept. 14, 2001 | NEW YORK -- Walking down Houston Street in New York this
<br>
afternoon, in what a few days ago was the shadow of the Twin Towers, a woman
<br>
lowered the umbrella that had been shielding her daughter and herself from
<br>
the tapering rain. &quot;Those were God's tears,&quot; she explained to her little
<br>
girl.
<br>
<p>My mother had a very different explanation for her daughter today. &quot;To me,
<br>
this rain is proof that there is no God,&quot; she said on the phone from Boston.
<br>
&quot;People say that God can't help terrorism, that he gives people freedom to
<br>
act as they choose. Fine. But a God who would hinder the rescue workers with
<br>
rain? If God can't control nature, then what's the point? How can anyone
<br>
believe today?&quot;
<br>
<p>It's a bewildering day for us atheists, this state-appointed &quot;Day of Prayer
<br>
and Remembrance.&quot; Like the faithful, we mourn. We look for guidance. We look
<br>
for answers. Our commander in chief tells us to find solace in churches and
<br>
temples. In those churches and temples, people stand at podiums, survey
<br>
their mass of grief-stricken congregants and intone the unfathomable words
<br>
&quot;God will protect us.&quot;
<br>
<p>Like many New Yorkers, I've seen the shattering hell of mass destruction
<br>
this week. None of this is metaphor: I have touched the ash-covered
<br>
shoulders of gasping survivors. I have trudged through the debris that
<br>
thickly coats the ghost town of Tribeca, staring in shock at the five-story
<br>
pyre that was a tower of human life and achievement. I have watched families
<br>
crumple into each other in shaking, tear-soaked sorrow outside St. Vincent's
<br>
Hospital when they are told, no, there is no information about your sister,
<br>
your husband, your daughter. And I have done so without experiencing what
<br>
some people have described to me as a uniting surge of faith in some
<br>
omniscient, everlasting force that will make us all whole again.
<br>
<p>I have long wondered if in the face of tragedy I would suddenly rely on
<br>
faith. As a member of a generation that came of age in a peacetime society,
<br>
I have always assumed that this transcendent tragedy would mean losing my
<br>
mother or father. I've seen friends -- skeptics like me -- pray in the
<br>
aftermath of such personal suffering. One of the lucky ones this week, I've
<br>
lost nobody close in the rubble downtown. Perhaps if I had, I would seek
<br>
solace in those exalted institutions that offered comfort to millions today.
<br>
<p>Instead, like my mother's, my atheism has only been strengthened by this
<br>
week of human catastrophe. At a &quot;Healing Eucharist&quot; service at a church
<br>
around the corner form St. Vincent's hospital, I got up to leave when the
<br>
rector chanted: &quot;Bless the Lord who forgives our sins,&quot; and the congregation
<br>
responded: &quot;His mercy endures forever.&quot; In a nearby house of alternative
<br>
healing, I snuck out the side door when I was told, &quot;As spiritual seekers we
<br>
must understand these things happen for a purpose. If we don't accept that,
<br>
all we'll have is anger and animosity in our hearts.&quot; I believe anger and
<br>
animosity is an appropriate response to mass murder.
<br>
<p>But while my Day of Prayer has been free of trust in saints, swamis and
<br>
shamans, it has not been without a resurrection of sorts. Again and again
<br>
this week, I have found my faith restored by the immeasurably selfless
<br>
valiance of earthly heroes. Last night I met a holy trinity of ironworkers
<br>
among the believers who congregated on the western end of Houston Street.
<br>
There, on the corner of Sixth Avenue, was a mass of citizens waving flags
<br>
and cheering for each truckload of rescue workers speeding north for a few
<br>
hours of rest before reentering the inferno.
<br>
<p>Mike, Ron and Steve are all local ironworkers who were blowing off steam
<br>
with a few six-packs of Bud, yelling AC/DC lyrics and flirting with girls
<br>
before they headed south for another 15-hour shift. (That's how they were
<br>
planning to spend their Day of Prayer, fighting smoke and falling debris to
<br>
cut steel beams away from trapped bodies.) These guys, and thousands like
<br>
them, marched into ground zero without training or enough fear to hold them
<br>
back.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's too graphic,&quot; said Steve, as he fidgeted with the gauze that covered a
<br>
new wound. &quot;Piles of death. I don't have the words to tell you. But
<br>
nothing's gonna keep me away from going back.&quot; Mike wrapped a
<br>
grime-blackened arm around his buddy Ron, still wearing his hard hat. &quot;Let
<br>
me tell you, I hung my head low today,&quot; he said. We left a lot of dead
<br>
people today. But I've got faith in my boys here. True faith. Religious
<br>
faith. We're ironworkers! And we'll show them what America can take; I don't
<br>
care if we have to die trying.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course many of these rescuers are strong believers, able -- some say
<br>
obligated -- to do their brave work because of their faith in God. But
<br>
listening to the parade of preachers speak in the National Cathedral today,
<br>
it was these dusty and unshaven faces that I meditated upon like religious
<br>
icons.
<br>
<p>With this astonishing human bravery to bless America, who needs God?
