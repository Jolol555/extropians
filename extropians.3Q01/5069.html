<em>&gt; &gt; Actually, the immigration of all those Mexican peasants does indeed matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to us all, especially those of us who are planning to be frozen if old age
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ain't cured pretty soon.  The substantial MAJORITY of immigrants, Mexicans or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; otherwise, are &quot;peasants.&quot;  From my observations, peasants don't run much of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a country. Mainly, they live in kleptocracies. I don't want the USA to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; kleptocracy. I doubt cryonics would be legal for the common man in the USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were uneducated peasants to abound in the USA.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everything hinges on the rate of cultural uptake.  My own ancestors came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a variety of European countries most of which had no clue concerning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traditions of liberty.  Sometimes I suspect that the decline in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect for those traditions may have been the fault of a number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nineteenth century immigrants who tried, but who just didn't &quot;get it&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then when opportunities to socialize a great many things in the 20th
</em><br>
<em>&gt; century arose, they and their descendents embraced these &quot;naturally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appealing&quot; programs.
</em><br>
<p><p>I have known too many people from other countries who deeply
<br>
appreciated freedom compared to the conditions back home.  Many
<br>
of them appreciated much, much more than we who were born into
<br>
it because they really understand the difference first hand!  
<br>
So the counter-position may be true, the decline in appreciation
<br>
of liberty and of a liberal republic is from those born to it
<br>
forgetting what they have and not enough influx of people who
<br>
understand very well what a treasure it is.
