<p>
I was very disappointed in Harvey Newstrom's response to my point,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It would seem appropriate to debate the assertions made in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; article, rather than instantly dig into what you think the author's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; personal agenda is, or what that of the group that he works for is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Such investigations should be secondary, and later, IMO.  Surely you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; agree that what someone says should not be dismissed just because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the person also happens to be religious?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did not bring in any additional information not referenced in the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; document you posted.
</em><br>
<p>Hah!  You *began* by complaining that the *organization* is religious.
<br>
You have yet to show me *anything* in that article that is religious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I did was follow standard, scientific critiquing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; methods for peer-review of any scholarly publication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - I read the article
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - I visited their site as the article suggested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - I read their supporting documentation as the article suggested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - I followed the url links the article presented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - I double-checked the source references given in the article
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - I reviewed the methodology used for their historical &quot;reinterpretation&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is standard for a scientific or scholarly review.  Did you want me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read the article without reading their support documents?  Accept their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretations without reading the originals?  Accept their findings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without reviewing their methodology?  Debate the conclusions without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questioning the &quot;facts&quot;?  As an author, consultant, researcher and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientist, this scholarly or scientific review is the only one I know how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do.  On what other basis should I form an evaluation of this article?
</em><br>
<p>That is all well and good, even commendable; but I don't care whether
<br>
you read so-called &quot;supporting&quot; documents from the web site or not.
<br>
Again, you *began* with
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why is this stuff on the Extropians List?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Claremont Institute is not only a conservative organization, but it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically a religious conservative organization.  They believe that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US was founded....
</em><br>
<p>You are clearly attacking the post *not* by what's in it, but by
<br>
who wrote it.  That would be exactly if I rebutted an anti-evolution
<br>
scientific argument by saying, &quot;This person is a Creationist.  He
<br>
belongs to an organization....&quot;.  
<br>
<p>Therefore, I will re-phrase Mike Lorrey's original question to you:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Why do [often] start off your denounciation of any post you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; disagree with by claiming that the website that is hosting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; information is owned by [someone of a certain stripe]?
</em><br>
<p>I will also ask, why don't you just begin by quoting parts of the
<br>
article that offended you, and critcize them instead?  (Honestly,
<br>
it does give the impression that you cannot.)
<br>
<p>Can you answer these two questions?
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
<p>Lee
