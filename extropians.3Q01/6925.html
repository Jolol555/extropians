<em>&gt; I am probably digging my grave deeper here but I have to ask,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;How many Afgani lives are worth $7.5 billion?&quot;.
</em><br>
Robert I don't think your grave can get any deeper, I think you have already
<br>
broke the earth's crust on the other side of the planet.
<br>
<em> &gt;A show I watched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yesterday indicated that Continental is laying of 13,000 employees.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is going to ripple out to many economies around the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A global economic slowdown will &quot;trickle down&quot; to the third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world likely decreasing incomes of the poorest of the poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resulting in increased deaths from hunger and starvation.
</em><br>
<p>I heard that bin Laden use to have a price tag of 5 million on his head. But
<br>
in terms of the kinds of sums we are looking at now this is only coffee and
<br>
donut money. I wonder how much the terrorism problem could be mitigated by
<br>
offering substantial rewards, say in the billions of dollars, to bring down
<br>
bin Laden network. I think it might be easier to raise a huge coffer for
<br>
such rewards than it would be to raise armed forces. Indeed, this might be
<br>
one way to keep up a sustained offensive on terrorists around the world.
<br>
Presumably we would need some sort of international judicial system to
<br>
dispense the rewards and put down guide lines for acceptable means to bring
<br>
the terrorists down.  I suppose to some it will look like we are trying to
<br>
save western lives at the expense of other lives. But the reality is that
<br>
fewer lives overall would probably be lost this way. Those closer to the
<br>
Terrorists will know their ways better and probably be better equipped to
<br>
spare the lives of the innocent.  Certainly this seems a little less drastic
<br>
than your &quot;final solution&quot;.
<br>
Mark.
