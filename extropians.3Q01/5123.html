Another site of interest is <a href="http://www.centagenetix.com/">http://www.centagenetix.com/</a>.  This is
<br>
a company founded by the main authors of the new paper.  It describes
<br>
itself as &quot;a development stage biotechnology company founded to discover
<br>
the genetic basis of longevity.&quot;
<br>
<p>They are developing what they call the Ideal Genome.  &quot;Centagenetix[tm]
<br>
believes that its proprietary database of genetic and phenotypic
<br>
information from centenarians may represent the Ideal Genome[tm] for
<br>
comparison in the discovery, identification, and study of specific genes
<br>
associated with age-related diseases.&quot;
<br>
<p>Not too much information at the site; they don't have the paper up either.
<br>
Their press release seems to be the basis for most of the news stories:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prevalent belief among researchers in the field of aging research
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been that as many as 1,000 genes influence aging. Kunkel, Annibale
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Puca, M.D., and their colleagues in the Division of Genetics at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children's Hospital Boston were able to pinpoint a region on Chromosome
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 in humans containing one, or at most, a few longevity-related genes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by looking at the trait of exceptional longevity, rather than genes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responsible for age-related diseases. Having found the region in which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this gene or genes lie, the group intends to identify the exact gene
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or genes responsible for longevity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DNA was extracted from whole blood obtained from 137 so-called sibships
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- centenarians and one or more siblings (ages 91 to 109 years) -- for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a total of 308 people predominantly of European descent. Co-authors
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kunkel and Puca, then performed a sibling pair linkage study, using
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;400 markers spread along the entire human genome to find any region
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their subjects had in common.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The search led them to a region on Chromosome 4 that contains between
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100 to 500 genes. They are 95 percent certain that area is the right
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place to search for specific genes that are in part responsible for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exceptional longevity.
