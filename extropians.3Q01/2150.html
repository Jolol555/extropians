<p>Spike,
<br>
<p>I can't believe you say this.  Here in Florida we sometimes have pollution
<br>
problems where we have to shut down the beaches.  We have tar balls wash up
<br>
on shore.  We have bacteria blooms.  We have fish kills.  It is the ocean
<br>
equivalent of bad air days.  Sometimes the pollution gets so bad that it
<br>
starts killing things in the water, and they patrol the beach to keep humans
<br>
from going in.  These can be directly traced back to petroleum products,
<br>
sewage streams, fertilizer runoff or cruise ship dumping.  There is a reason
<br>
that Jeb Bush doesn't want oil drilling of Florida's coast.  We are already
<br>
seeing the problems with pollution.  As someone who has grown up in Florida
<br>
and see these things, I can't imagine someone dismissing the concept of
<br>
ocean pollution.
<br>
<p>By the way, the reason the fish tastes the same is that we shut down Florida
<br>
waters for fishing when bacteria or heavy metals get too high.  We have
<br>
regular patrols that measure contaminants in water and open/close areas as
<br>
pollution levels change.  In the water-management offices, there are whole
<br>
maps showing current pollution levels.  The green areas of safety and the
<br>
red areas of contamination move around over the weeks like a weather map.
<br>
We have had entire seasons of fishing or clamming canceled in various
<br>
counties due to sustained pollution levels.  We have state officers who
<br>
trace the pollutants back to the source, fine the company until they stop
<br>
it, and then monitor the polluted area for a few months or years until they
<br>
can open it up again.  We didn't have to do this when I was a kid.
<br>
<p>I don't want anyone to think that I am anti-technology.  I am very
<br>
pro-technology.  However, we must be realistic.  Air pollution and water
<br>
pollution really do exist.  They are not imaginary phenomenon or
<br>
conspiracies cooked up by the liberal left.
