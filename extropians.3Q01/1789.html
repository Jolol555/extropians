<em>&gt;I am curious as to what you are talking about.  What countries were involved 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in this conduct you are talking about?  What army?  Not my army.  What 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;security forces?  And which dictatorship are you talking about?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ron h.
</em><br>
<p>Um. Darn, seems I'm bent on a path of confussion today, sorry. ;-)
<br>
<p>Let's try again. I mentioned that in Argentina, it is not unheard of for
<br>
security forces to use live ammo to disperse protests, even pacific ones.
<br>
It is not a regular event, but it happens too often for good. In Argentina,
<br>
there is still a sad kind of institutional thinking inside security forces
<br>
that originates on the doctrines and methods of the last dictatorship.
<br>
The dictatorship I'm referring to is the 'Process of National
<br>
Reorganization', which ruled from 1976 to 1983 after a successful coup
<br>
against a democratic elected government. Our army, navy and air force
<br>
shared the government in equal terms via a triumvirate, with a fascist-like
<br>
political program and a pro-oligopolies economy program. They took control
<br>
of police matters and internal security too, quickly stomping the local
<br>
right-wing and left-wing guerillas. And then they proceeded to do away
<br>
with several thousand of political &quot;undesirables&quot;, making abundant use of
<br>
small concentration camps, torture, death squads, rape, looting,
<br>
commercial fraud and such.
<br>
<p>Not surprisingly, this behaviour became an institutional trait of all
<br>
our security forces for a long time after the 'Process' had to flee
<br>
in disgrace after bungling the economy completely and also losing a criminally
<br>
incompetent war on the Malvinas/Falklands against the UK. To a sadly long
<br>
extent, many personnel in federal and provincial police, army, and
<br>
territorial guard, still behave some times as if the old methods are
<br>
ok and immunity is the natural thing to expect.
<br>
<p>-C.
