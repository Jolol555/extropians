<p>Delhi children make play of the net
<br>
<p>The slum children figured out how to use the computer
<br>
<p>In the slums of Delhi, an experiment has shown how illiterate street
<br>
children can quickly teach themselves the rudiments of computers and the
<br>
internet.
<br>
<p>The aim of the experiment, funded by the Indian Government, local
<br>
institutions and the World Bank was to see what role computers might play
<br>
in educating India's illiterate millions.
<br>
<p>The results were startling, showing how much children with little or no
<br>
English and no computer training at all could achieve.
<br>
<p>Simple idea
<br>
<p>The project was the brainchild of Sugata Mitra, who spearheads research
<br>
and development at NIIT, a training and software company in Delhi.
<br>
<p>His idea was simple. He installed a computer on the wall of his south
<br>
Delhi office that was facing a slum and watched what happened.
<br>
<p>Children in the slum were intrigued by the icons on the computer, and
<br>
completely without any help, gradually figured out how to use the
<br>
computers and access the internet.
<br>
<p>&quot;What they would see is the opening screen of MSN.com. They started
<br>
fiddling around with the touchpad and quickly noticed that finger
<br>
movements on the touchpad moved something on the screen,&quot; said Mr Mitra
<br>
told the BBC World Service's Go Digital.
<br>
<p>&quot;That caused a lot of consternation and they called all their friends to
<br>
see this new television where you can actually move something with your
<br>
finger.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Very quickly, they discovered that the cursor changes to a hand shape
<br>
when you bring it close to an underlined word and then accidentally
<br>
discovered that you can change pages.
<br>
<p>All this happened within minutes and so that by about the eighth minute
<br>
they were actually surfing.&quot;
<br>
<p>Painting and downloading music
<br>
<p>Mr Mitra found that within days the children were able to browse the
<br>
internet, cut and paste copy, drag and drop items and create folders.
<br>
<p>One of the things they particularly liked was drawing, discovering how to
<br>
use the MSpaint programme to create paintings.
<br>
<p>The children then moved on to downloading games and playing then. They did
<br>
not stop there.
<br>
<p>By the second month they had discovered MP3 music files and they were
<br>
downloading songs.
<br>
<p>&quot;All this happened as far as I can tell from incidental learning and peer
<br>
to peer learning,&quot; said Mr Mitra.
<br>
<p>The 'hole-in-the-wall' experiment has been repeated several times in
<br>
places like Madantusi near Lucknow and the results have been mostly
<br>
identical.
<br>
<p>&quot;Computers are really hard to use, they're not intuitive. they're not
<br>
obvious, they complicated and clunky and tend to do the wrong things at
<br>
the wrong time,&quot; said new media consultant Bill Thompson.
<br>
<p>&quot;But with children, if you give them free access to a computer, they will
<br>
learn very quickly. They will adapt and will really exploit the system to
<br>
get the most out of it.&quot;
