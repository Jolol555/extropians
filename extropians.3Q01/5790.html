<p>I can't talk about the other parts with any authority, but as I live
<br>
in Scotland here's my take on the situation. Remember to correct for
<br>
whatever you perceive as being my ideological bias! Especially bear
<br>
in mind that I'm not Scottish -- I'm an incomer, from Yorkshire (with
<br>
ancestors who got out of Poland one jump ahead of a pogrom).
<br>
<p>Basically, the Scottish situation all depends on how the SNP play their
<br>
cards -- and how the government in Wesminster plays _its_ cards.
<br>
<p>Scotland used to be socially conservative with a small-c; it still is, to
<br>
some extent, especially in the highlands and islands, but 70% of the 
<br>
population currently lives in a lowland belt running from Glasgow to
<br>
Edinburgh (fifty miles apart) via the M8 corridor. This is an urban
<br>
and increasingly sophisticated population, albeit with pockets of
<br>
horrible social deprivation where rust belt industries shut down. The
<br>
M8 corridor, in contrast, is one of the UK's technological hot-spots,
<br>
sometimes referred to as &quot;silicon glen&quot;.
<br>
<p>Up until 1979, the Scottish Nationalist Party was basically a sideshow.
<br>
Nicknamed &quot;the tartan tories&quot; they were a rather right-wing minority
<br>
party in the highlands. Relevence: zip. 
<br>
<p>In the 1950's, Scotland mostly voted Conservative; until the Conservatives
<br>
began taking the Scots for granted. Big mistake. Labour made slow but 
<br>
steady progress, until by 1980 or thereabouts it was just about the main
<br>
party in Scotland.
<br>
<p>Then Margaret Thatcher was elected.
<br>
<p>Thatcher made an interesting electoral calculation. Her government
<br>
majority was dependant on getting an absolute majority of the MP's elected
<br>
to parliament on a regional basis.  Her first actions in government were
<br>
to cut off a lot of state-run industries at the ankles.  Because the
<br>
industries she went for were rust-belt smokestack ones, the blow fell
<br>
disproportionately on the north of England and on Scotland, where the
<br>
heavy engineering was traditionally based.
<br>
<p>Thatcher's electoral calculation only became explicit at the 1983
<br>
election; basically it could be summed up as &quot;piss on the scots&quot;. Scotland
<br>
returned about 60 MP's to parliament in those days, of which maybe
<br>
20 were Conservative.  Thatcher could turn death squads loose north
<br>
of the border, and all it could lose her were about 20 MPs. However,
<br>
tactics that hurt the industrial infrastructure (of the north) but were
<br>
good for the financial services and agriculture sectors (in the south)
<br>
would get her up to 150 additional MPs. Ergo, from Thatcher's point of
<br>
view, Scotland could piss in a boot: she was going to run the UK strictly
<br>
on behalf of the south-east of England.
<br>
<p>An example of the disdain with which she treated Scotland; the Poll Tax. 
<br>
This didn't make much news outside the UK, but it's the tax policy that
<br>
ultimately led to Thatcher's down-fall. It was introduced in Scotland a 
<br>
year ahead of England, explicitly as a pilot project (coincidentally 
<br>
violating the terms of the 1707 Act of Union between the two nations) and
<br>
provoked the biggest tax rebellion in British history. 
<br>
<p>Even after Thatcher resigned, her successors in the Major governments
<br>
followed the same policies towards Scotland: they ran it as a colony
<br>
rather than a state, because the same electoral calculation applied. The
<br>
issue of North Sea Oil complicated things, too. According to figures
<br>
from the Central Office of Information (_very_ quietly leaked just before
<br>
the 1997 election) £40 billion more in taxes were raised in Scotland than
<br>
were spent there during the 1980's. While the lion's share of this was tax 
<br>
on fuel, you can imagine the resentment it caused in a country where there
<br>
were large and horrendous patches of poverty left over from Thatcher's 
<br>
early 1980's closure of steel mills, shipyards, and coal mines.
<br>
<p>These policies culminated in the conservative's electoral disaster of 1997,
<br>
in which they were literally wiped out, north of the border: as in, every
<br>
single one of their sitting MP's lost his seat, and they were eliminated
<br>
as a parliamentary party in Scotland.
<br>
<p>While Thatcher and her successors were committing electoral suicide north
<br>
of the border by thinking globally and misbehaving locally, the other
<br>
parties were not idle. The SNP went through a major reformist patch in
<br>
the 80's, realised that to even *look* conservative would be electoral
<br>
suicide, and repositioned themselves to the left. Labour ... as a 
<br>
libertarian Glaswegian friend of mine puts it, &quot;in Glasgow, you could
<br>
put up a plank with a red rosette and it'd be elected&quot;. Labour was simply
<br>
the natural party of government, with &gt;50% of the votes. The Liberal/SDP
<br>
Alliance had some popularity and managed to build on it, especially after
<br>
they formerly merged and formed the Liberal Democrat party, but they were
<br>
basically competing with the SNP for second place.
<br>
<p>Now, fast-forward to the present.
<br>
<p>The Blair government was elected with two agendas: a radical agenda and a
<br>
conservative agenda. The conservative agenda: to stick to the former
<br>
Conservative government's economic plans. In point of fact, former 
<br>
Conservative chancellor (and current leadership contender) Ken Clarke
<br>
has described New Labour as being economically to the right of his wing
<br>
of the Conservative party. However, New Labour has a _very_ radical
<br>
constitutional agenda. This included, in 1997, abolition of the House
<br>
of Lords and its replacement by an elected Senate, introduction of a Bill
<br>
of Rights, Freedom of Information Act, and possibly a written Constitution,
<br>
devolution (state government) for Scotland and Wales, tighter integration
<br>
with the EU, and possible membership of the Euro zone (single currency).
<br>
<p>Bits of the constitutional agenda have fallen by the wayside: New Labour
<br>
is as addicted to power as the Conservatives used to be -- the conservatives
<br>
seem to have lost it in that respect -- and Blair found it more convenient
<br>
to have a rump, appointed House of Lords than to replace it with a possibly
<br>
fractious and disobedient Senate. But the Devolution vote went through on
<br>
the nod in New Labour's first twelve months -- leading to a pro-devolution
<br>
referendum and regional government elections in 1999.
<br>
<p>Before the New Labour victory of 1997, the Scottish Nationalists were
<br>
gaining ground rapidly, up to 30% of the vote; but once New Labour
<br>
rammed through devolution plans, the festering boil of resentment against
<br>
colonial rule from the south was lanced; most people seem to have decided
<br>
to wait and see how their own regional administration works out. The
<br>
Scottish assembly has quite a lot of power: it's easier to say what it
<br>
doesn't have than what it does have. It doesn't have defense or foreign
<br>
relations responsibilities. It can't negotiate treaties, or vary taxes
<br>
by more than 4% either way. It's got total control over criminal law with
<br>
one exception -- drugs policy was retained by the Home Office down south.
<br>
Otherwise, almost all domestic Scottish legislation is now debated and
<br>
voted on in Edinburgh. From being run as a colony, Scotland has acquired
<br>
a degree of political autonomy comparable to, or greater than, that of 
<br>
a US state.
<br>
<p>The remaining festering constitutional problem is the West Lothian
<br>
Question, so named because it was asked by MP Tam Dalyell. The question
<br>
is this: If English MPs can no longer vote on Scottish issues, why do
<br>
Scottish MPs still sit in the English parliament? So far, it's been
<br>
answered by Scottish MP's simply refraining, voluntarily, from voting on
<br>
England-only issues. But it's a constitutional mess that needs resolving
<br>
-- trouble is, it seems to call for a separate English parliament and
<br>
a formal federal system.
<br>
<p>Now, as to the future ...
<br>
<p>The SNP have about 25% of the vote. The LDP have about 25% of the vote.
<br>
(While the LDP is a British party, they're willing to consider Scottish
<br>
independence if a majority the people vote for it in a referendum.) New
<br>
Labour has about 40% of the vote, and the Conservatives have a rump 10%.
<br>
<p>It remains possible for the government in Westminster -- regardless of who
<br>
they are -- to shoot themselves in the head north of the border and do 
<br>
something horrendously unpopular.  If that happens, support for the SNP
<br>
will probably rocket. Election terms in the UK are not fixed, but the
<br>
next Scottish election is due in 2002, and terms are 4-5 years long. If
<br>
such an event happens shortly before an election, watch out for an SNP/LDP
<br>
coalition and a referendum on independence for Scotland. 
<br>
<p>In practice, a majority of Scottish voters are currently disinclined to 
<br>
leave the UK (although a core of 20-30% favour outright independence). But,
<br>
as I said, that could be aggravated; at the peak of the Thatcher/Poll Tax
<br>
mess, support for independence shot up to over 50%.
<br>
<p>It's worth noting that according to figures released by the SNP, Scotland
<br>
as a separate economy fits the Maastricht single currency convergence
<br>
criteria quite well. The SNP want Scotland to go independent within the
<br>
European Union, which contains quite a few other countries with a high
<br>
tech industrial base and a population on the order of 5 million.
<br>
<p>I expect that if the UK joins the Euro zone, the question will ultimately
<br>
become trivial: one of legal jurisdiction within a federal superpower, i.e.
<br>
does the UK join as two or three states, or as one.
<br>
<p>One point to note: every so often the newspapers go on about insults and
<br>
violence directed at incomers from the south (and at asylum seekers). Speaking
<br>
as a non-Scot living in Scotland, I haven't seen any of that. But then,
<br>
I'm from the North of England.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;                          ...  Is a series of seccessions by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left-leaning regions Jeff's wishful thinking or a reasonable possibility?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it's possible. During the Thatcher years it even seemed likely;
<br>
currently the government in Westminster is smart enough to realise
<br>
this and take measures to defuse the pressure. But the critical point
<br>
to note is that it is not nationalism based on hyperpatriotism so much
<br>
as nationalism based on rejection of an unwanted external influence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have always thought of regionalism as a &quot;right&quot; leaning conservative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomena...Aztlan and Dixie ...not Alaska, Quebec and Scotland.
</em><br>
<p>For the classic example of nationalism and secession in a left-wing
<br>
context, consider Yugoslavia and the late USSR. It's not just a right-
<br>
wing phenomenon. I think the real secessionist problem may turn out to
<br>
be post-communist China ...
