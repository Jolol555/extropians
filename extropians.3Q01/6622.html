<p><em>&gt; I view &quot;intelligence&quot; (in terms of ability to hold, manipulate

</em><br>
<p>Well IANAP (I am not a philosopher), but, this seems to be a bit
<br>
odd as a stab at defining intelligence.  A computer with a hard
<br>
disk can hold and manipulate much larger quantities of
<br>
information of at least some types that I can and much faster. 
<br>
Does this make the computer more intelligent?  With the right
<br>
programming it can even extrapolate and combine this information
<br>
to make new discoveries.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  I know of an individual who went through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MIT as a physics major with a 4.0 GPA -- a person much smarter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than myself -- who maintained a very deep Christian perspective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of life.  Intelligence and religion are two very very different realms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intelligence is about how much information one can manipulate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Religion is, to some extent, about the value you place on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information being manipulated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What about the quality of the manipulations and the conclusions
<br>
derived from the information and the feedback loops from priopr
<br>
manipulations to more abstract manipulations leading to more
<br>
efficient future interactions?  All of these are part of what
<br>
intelligence is.  Some of them are also part of what some
<br>
aspects of religious systems are.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The perspective that we need to develop, that I think may be lacking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is &quot;What is *really* valuable?&quot;.  Increasing the number of raw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bits is of course wonderful -- but how do we evaluatate the value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of those bits?  Sooner or later we are going to hit the limits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational and data storage resources.  When that happens what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you save and what do you erase?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Bits of themselves are not terribly &quot;relevant&quot;.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; What we are observing with the Moslem Jihads is a perspective that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;your bits are worthless&quot;.  And from within the perspective of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, that may be an entirely valid belief.  However it is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear to me that the Western perspective of democracies or societies
</em><br>
<p>Is then &quot;validity&quot; utterly relative and baseless?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &quot;free to believe in a variety of moral systems&quot; can claim the high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ground.  In watching the ceremonies at Washington National Cathedral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today, I was struck by the fact that all of the speakers were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calling on God in one way or another.  While I had tears in my eyes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with regard to the losses being discussed, I could not help but observe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the degree to which even a free, rational society is invoking icons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and histories which are as dubious as those on which Moslem perspectives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are based.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is very clear to me that a system that affirms the rights of
<br>
individuals and the freedom to believe as one pleases without
<br>
trampling the rights of others does have the high ground over
<br>
any system that coerces the individual to one set of belief
<br>
structures whether they make sense to the individual or not.  
<br>
<p>Due to the lack of rational value systems (mostly) and the
<br>
failure of modern non-religious philosophy to produce strong
<br>
value systems, it is to be expected than when strong value and
<br>
emotion laden things are being disucssed that the language of
<br>
religion will be invoked fairly often.  
<br>
<p>This does not mean, however, that since all are invoking
<br>
religious symbology that all the positions and societies
<br>
involved are equivalent or at all indistinquishable from one
<br>
another and therefore cannot be rationally evaluated for
<br>
relative merits and demerits. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; My perspective is this -- Can we construct a society and moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value system based on &quot;reality&quot;?  I think it is essential that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we really, seriously begin to ask ourselves *and others* the question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;How do you *know* what you know?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Every morning when I get out of bed I extend my feet over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; edge and I observe whether or not they are accelerated towards the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; floor of my bedroom.  So far, they always have been and thus I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confident that the physical law of gravity is still working.  However
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am keenly aware that many of the things that I believe depend on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the trust relationships that I have with researchers and scientists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I may only know on the basis of reputation.  In reality, I must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admit only a &quot;hope&quot; that the supersymmetry theory of physical particles is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valid.  This is not so much different from the faith that the terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who got on the planes Tuesday have in their perspectives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I hope that you understand this is quite a bit different.  Your
<br>
belief system is based on conclusions arrived at, by yourself
<br>
and others, in a system designed to question and test each
<br>
assumption and result.  Mostly, with some notable exceptions,
<br>
this is not true of the way most religions work or at least of
<br>
the way most people adhere to religions.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; How do we know what we know?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do we value one collection of bits above another?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>These are good questions.  But in the meantime we have at least
<br>
one shortcut.  Which belief systems result in the most
<br>
transformative potential?
