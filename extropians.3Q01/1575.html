<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Personal choices add up to ten years to lifespan
<br>
<p>The July 9 2001 issue of the journal Archives of Internal Medicine published
<br>
of the results of research that set out to prove that prevention, as
<br>
accomplished by diet, exercise and not smoking, effects lifespan.  Although
<br>
this seems like a self-evident hypothesis, few longterm studies have
<br>
verified it.
<br>
<p>The researchers enrolled 34,192 Seventh-Day Adventists in California in
<br>
1976, who were followed until 1988.  Many Seventh-Day Adventists follow
<br>
vegetarian diets, are nonsmokers, and are perceived in general to have
<br>
healthier habits than most Americans.  At the study's onset, participants
<br>
filled out a questionnaire in regard to their diet as well as exercise and
<br>
other habits.  Subjects were contacted on a yearly basis and asked if they
<br>
had been hospitalized.  The 5,193 deaths that occurred were verified by
<br>
state records.
<br>
<p>Nearly one third of the participants were categorized as vegetarian, defined
<br>
as consuming meat less than once per month.  None of the participants were
<br>
smokers.  Forty percent indicated that they exercised vigorously for fifteen
<br>
minutes three times per week or more often.  Over half of the women had used
<br>
hormone replacement therapy.  The positive association between hormone
<br>
replacement and lifespan may be attributable to the fact that women who use
<br>
HRT are generally more health-conscious, as the only large clinical trial on
<br>
HRT did not show that it prevents heart disease as previously believed.
<br>
<p>Survival of the study participants was compared to that for California
<br>
non-Hispanic caucasians for the year1985, the midpoint of the study.  It was
<br>
determined that at age 30, the Seventh-Day Adventists men had a life
<br>
expectancy seven years greater than the comparison population, giving them
<br>
an average expected age at death of 81.2 years.  Women could expect nearly
<br>
four and one half years more life than the comparison group, anticipating a
<br>
lifespan of 83.9 years.   The vegetarians in the group could expect an
<br>
additional two years.  The researchers concluded that the combination of
<br>
diet, exercise, body mass index, smoking habits and, in women, hormone
<br>
replacement, appear to account for up to ten years of increased life
<br>
expectancy in the Seventh Day Adventists, providing them with possibly the
<br>
highest life expectancy of any group studied, including the Japanese.  Since
<br>
this population has no biological differences from the comparison group,
<br>
their increased life expectancy can be attributed to personal behaviors.
<br>
For most of us wishing to live longer, an extra ten years is of inestimable
<br>
value, and our own choice.
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
Free radical fighter studied
<br>
<p>MetaPhore Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug that mimics the effects of
<br>
superoxide dismutase or SOD, one of the body's own highly potent
<br>
antioxidants. The drug, M40403, was recently shown in an clinical trial to
<br>
be safe and well tolerated. The trial was a first, as no small molecule
<br>
drugs that imitate antioxidant enzymes have previously been tested on
<br>
humans. Efficacy studies will follow.
<br>
Superoxide dismutase is an enzyme that scavenges the damaging superoxide
<br>
radical. Superoxide has been found to be overproduced by the body in cancer
<br>
and other diseases. The body's production of SOD subsequently becomes
<br>
inadequate, allowing the superoxide radical to react with other molecules,
<br>
damaging tissue.
<br>
<p>The next study will utilize the drug in combination with interleukin-2 in
<br>
patients with end stage kidney cancer and advanced melanoma. Studies in
<br>
models of cancer have demonstrated that M40403 limits the drop in blood
<br>
pressure caused by interleukin-2 and appears to increase its tumor-fighting
<br>
ability. Side effects of high-dose interleukin-2 therapy can be
<br>
life-threatening and usually require that the patient receiving it be
<br>
treated in an intensive care unit.  Some individuals are unable to complete
<br>
their course of treatment.

<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Prevention
<br>
<p>The concept of taking actions now to maintain youthful health is based on
<br>
published scientific studies showing that the diseases of aging may be
<br>
prevented, or can at least be postponed.  People who want to reduce their
<br>
risk of disease are often overwhelmed by the volume of technical data on the
<br>
subject.  The Life Extension Foundation has reviewed more than sixty-four
<br>
years' worth of published medical literature, and Foundation personnel have
<br>
spent more than thirty-five years working with physicians and scientists in
<br>
the antiaging field.
<br>
<p>Before you embark on a program to reduce your risk of degenerative disease,
<br>
it is important for you to know about scientific studies conducted on humans
<br>
that show these therapies really work. If you are not aware of these
<br>
published studies, you may be unlikely to methodically follow a long-term
<br>
disease prevention program.
<br>
<p>Hundreds of research studies have been published documenting the health
<br>
benefits of antioxidants. Antioxidants protect the body against agents of
<br>
disease called free radicals, which cause chemical reactions (oxidation)
<br>
that destroy cells and damage tissues. Oxidation is thought to be not only
<br>
one of the most common mechanisms of disease, but also a basis of the aging
<br>
process. Free radicals cannot be avoided; ultraviolet light, for example, is
<br>
a common source. Therefore, it is essential to take antioxidants in order to
<br>
counteract this process and prevent the degenerative diseases of aging.
<br>
<p>Life Extension Mix supplies potent doses of the most powerful antioxidants:
<br>
vitamins C and E and vegetable extracts, which are known to repair the
<br>
cellular damage that accumulates with age. Studies have shown a variety of
<br>
health benefits for antioxidants. Research data have demonstrated
<br>
consistently that cancer risk is decreased by antioxidants, especially
<br>
vitamin C and lycopene. Beta-carotene helps offset the damage caused by
<br>
environmental pollutants. Both vitamins C and E prevent the oxidation of
<br>
&quot;bad&quot; LDL fat cells that leads to the buildup of fatty deposits inside
<br>
arteries (atherosclerosis). The Cambridge Heart Antioxidant Study reported
<br>
that those people with documented heart disease who took vitamin E
<br>
significantly decreased their risk of heart attack. Another recent study
<br>
found that vitamin E slows the loss of potency of the immune system that
<br>
occurs with age. Vitamin E may also improve brain function. The Life
<br>
Extension Mix makes it easy to ensure that you get the proper amounts of
<br>
these compounds that from diet alone are impossible to obtain.

<p>Chronoforte
<br>
<p>A large body of published evidence has now established that oxidative
<br>
modifications of proteins [carbonylation, etc.] occur during aging and in a
<br>
variety of pathophysiologic conditions, many being neurodegenerative
<br>
diseases including Alzheimer's disease.
<br>
<p>Carbonylation is caused by aldehydes that can be neutralized by
<br>
supplementation with carnosine and by increasing glutathione at the cellular
<br>
level with alpha lipoic acid.
<br>
<p>In addition to protecting against carbonylation, it is crucial to maintain
<br>
youthful mitochondrial energy production and immune function.
<br>
Acetyl-L-carnitine facilitates cellular energy production, while nettle leaf
<br>
extract suppresses high levels of a pro-inflammatory cytokine called tumor
<br>
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) believed to be a cause of immune senescence
<br>
(decline of the immune system in aging).
<br>
<p>ChronoForte is a multi-ingredient antiaging supplement that provides the
<br>
best documented nutrients to protect against carbonylation and a host of
<br>
other newly identified aging factors.
