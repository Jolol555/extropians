<em>&gt; It is interesting to note that the journal Nature has a section for art
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in science / science in art. I wonder how many art journals have that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The renaissance involved trying to create something new that unified the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old knowledge with the new scientific/economic/artistic discoveries, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then change society accordingly (although this later part only really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got underway during the enlightenment). I see many similarities with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today: we need a new renaissance to unify the old knowledge with the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discoveries and then find ways of changing our societies accordingly. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact that there are people trying to bridge the two cultures and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create a new synthesis isn't enough, as long as they stand fairly alone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and unsupported. What made the daring transdisciplinary work of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; renaissance so important was that it took place in a cultural context
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where it gained support and influence - the actual number of humanists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists, artists and engineers were fairly low, but they affected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society profoundly through various channels. Had these channels not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stood open, their effect would have been marginal and the renaissance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soon forgotten. We need to find the modern counterparts of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; channels of reaching into society and for creating a cultural context
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that promotes synthesis. 
</em><br>
<p>Remember also that there were many institutions giving their active support to these thinkers like the surging universities and like the Plato Academy of Florence.
<br>
<p>Ciao
