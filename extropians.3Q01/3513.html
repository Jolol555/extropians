<p><em>&gt;Sources please?  The Florida Legislature is wasting time changing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this law, because they seem to be under the same opinion I am that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the law is still valid and should be changed.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't search for related court cases, but the law in question is
<br>
U.S Code Title 39 sec 3406.
<br>
<p>Military absentee ballots are not usually postmarked because
<br>
they're entitled to be carried without postage.
<br>
<p>It is my understanding that Florida law conflicts with this law.
<br>
<p>That a potential commander-in-chief attempted to block military
<br>
ballots is considered by myself and other Veterans to be an
<br>
inexcusably despicable act.
