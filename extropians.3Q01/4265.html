</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; development of a completely different mindset on philosophical issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An interesting observation.  But I wonder if it is true?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are the underlying philosophical issues?
</em><br>
<p>First, as you realize, I am only guessing.  I'm not sure that I 
<br>
even know where to begin to address the underlying philosophical
<br>
issues.  I think that I will submit a personal narrative, to show
<br>
how simple so many of these issues have seemed to me for almost
<br>
thirty-five years.  I would love to read someone else's narrative
<br>
for comparison.  Or perhaps they can spot the unconscious 
<br>
assumptions that I've always made which might more easily now
<br>
be seen to be false.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think it has to do with the new information ontology that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emerging from computer science, the neo-Darwinian synthesis in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biology, genomics, cognitive neuroscience and perhaps even the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy-as-information ideas that seem to follow from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Austrian school.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps.  But this just doesn't explain the old &quot;hard-core&quot;
<br>
materialistic beliefs of people like Marvin Minsky, Dennett, 
<br>
the Churchlands, Turing, the Australian philosophers J.J.C.
<br>
Smart and D.M. Armstrong, Dawkins, Feynman, Danny Hillis,
<br>
Pinker, Gell-Mann, Penrose, Moravec, W.W. Bartley III,
<br>
Steven Weinberg, Martin Gardner, Donald Campbell, William
<br>
Calvin, David Deutsch, McCulloch, Jacque Monod, Hofstadter,
<br>
Gould, Crick, Tipler, Sagan, Susan Blackmore, and Mario
<br>
Bunge, and numerous other people who acquired their
<br>
beliefs about thirty years ago or so.  They were never
<br>
explicitly influenced by the &quot;neo-Darwin synthesis&quot; or
<br>
the Austrian school of economics.  They simply had a good
<br>
grasp of a lot of ordinary science, and didn't have any
<br>
dualist philosophical notions or strong religious beliefs.
<br>
<p>I think that it's entirely possible that there is a whole
<br>
range of *other* people who, for want of a better term, I'll
<br>
call &quot;non-materialists&quot;, who never had truly agreed or
<br>
appreciated that a reductionistic explanation (ontologically)
<br>
suffices for a satisfactory and comprehensive view of our
<br>
whole universe.  For these others, it is still a hard, cold,
<br>
cruel fact that the universe holds nothing more,
<br>
fundamentally, than atoms in motion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this ontology or paradigm, what matters is information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how it is processed.  While it might not be deliberately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functionalist, it has a functionalist flair to it, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has the usual scientific acceptance of interdisciplinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approaches.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the concept of functionalism may prove pivotal.  Where
<br>
are you going with this idea, or rather, does this have any
<br>
implications?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What would the corresponding literary paradigm be?  To me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it seems to be the postmodern paradigm, but maybe that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too narrow?
</em><br>
<p>Again, from my perhaps biased perspective, it is simply a 
<br>
question of whether one can handle (or even understand)
<br>
the ontological reduction of all phenomena to physics.  (I
<br>
follow Barrow and Tipler in distinguishing between epistem-
<br>
ological and ontological reductionism.  Like they, I don't
<br>
support the former:  our *explanations* of course in most
<br>
cases can not be reduced to concepts involving physics
<br>
only.  An example will make clear what I mean (to someone
<br>
besides you):  We can *explain* Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo
<br>
by appealing to the usual concepts of military history.  While
<br>
at some ridiculous level every event that occurred on that day,
<br>
June 18, 1815, is reducible to physics, the best explanations
<br>
of the outcome of the battle will never occur at that level.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps the important thing is the allegiance of the scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture to an objective world; even the most elusive concepts in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum mechanics or information theory are deep down something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective.  That they can be viewed in many arbitrary ways doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean that wave functions or entropies are arbitrary in themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Compare this to the far more subjective approach found in literary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circles, where the intertextual relationships are more important. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree: allegiance to objectivity is fundamental and crucial.
<br>
But I still need to be persuaded that there is any role for subjectivity
<br>
in literature either!  Certainly many post-modernists have attempted
<br>
to obliterate objectivity from historical inquiry, and have caused
<br>
tremendous damage.  So in all likelihood, honest literary criticism
<br>
has suffered at their hands in exactly the same way.
