<p>This sparked a memory in my mind of a very attractive young
<br>
white woman roller skating around Greenlake the other day.  The
<br>
most striking thing about her was the large tattoo that she had
<br>
covering most of her arms and shoulders.  She was someone who
<br>
obviously viewed her body as a canvas on which designs could be
<br>
painted.
<br>
<p>Now switch to genetic engineering -- control of skin color has
<br>
to be regulated by a very few genes.  That would suggest that
<br>
within a decade or so it should be feasible to pop a pill that
<br>
regulates how dark you are.  (Caucasians can already put on
<br>
suntan lotion that activates their endogenous tanning response).
<br>
Now I would guess that tattoos are not as effective on dark skinned
<br>
people due to the lack of contrast.  That would suggest that such
<br>
people would utilize genetic means to lighten their skin to allow
<br>
them to take advantage of tatooing.  Eventually we will get dynamic
<br>
control of skin color (though this will take a while).
<br>
<p>So isn't the debate kind of meaningless?  Skin color will no longer
<br>
be a useful marker for the identification of people as belonging
<br>
to a particular &quot;clan&quot;.  It seems to me that language is becoming
<br>
the key factor for the &quot;bin-ing&quot; of people you encounter rather than
<br>
color.
<br>
<p>And of course discussing policy based on any expectations about what
<br>
2050 is going to be like seems silly.  We know that 2050 is going
<br>
to be very different from any possible pictures of it we have today.
