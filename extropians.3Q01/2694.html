<p>Why &quot;Real-Time&quot; Business Takes Real Time
<br>
<p>They have the technology: Using Internet-driven software, companies can now
<br>
access up-to-the-minute sales and market data. Are they ready to flip the
<br>
switch?
<br>

<br>
<p>Imagine driving quickly along a curving road, peering through a specially
<br>
doctored windshield that updates your view only once a minute. Sounds
<br>
horrifying, doesn't it? Isn't it much better to see reality unfold moment by
<br>
moment, so that you can respond immediately to each twist and turn?
<br>
<p>Expressed that way, the choice is obvious: No sane person would choose the
<br>
time-delayed windshield. But in business, it's another story. Until
<br>
recently, existing technology left companies with no choice when it came to
<br>
finding out where they were and where they might be going. Since the 1960s,
<br>
they have largely relied on slow batch-processing systems to keep track of
<br>
internal corporate data -- sales, orders, and the rest. Using such systems,
<br>
company leaders have had to wait days, weeks, or even months to get a clear
<br>
outlook on the financial road ahead.
<br>
<p>Today, though, companies have a choice. As the Net becomes more and more
<br>
integral to the way business gets done, Internet technology brings a host of
<br>
opportunities for gathering data, aggregating it in meaningful ways, and
<br>
distributing it to key decision makers -- all in practically real time. In
<br>
other words, just as a windshield lets a driver see and respond to a change
<br>
in road conditions as soon as his vehicle encounters it, so this technology
<br>
lets a company leader discover and react instantly to, say, a sudden spike
<br>
or drop in consumer demand.
<br>
<p>At least a dozen young software outfits are now trying to get companies to
<br>
overhaul older, slower systems and to embrace what industry visionaries call
<br>
the &quot;real-time Internet.&quot; Each of these vendors has developed Web-based
<br>
software that promises to deliver up-to-the-minute access to essential
<br>
enterprise data.
<br>
<p>One typical newcomer is Closedloop Solutions, a Redwood City,
<br>
California-based company founded by Chandran Sankaran, 39, a former McKinsey
<br>
&amp; Co. consultant. Sankaran first saw the need for real-time access to
<br>
company data in the mid-1990s, when he found himself working on one
<br>
corporate-turnaround project after another for McKinsey. &quot;We'd go into these
<br>
companies that had hit a wall,&quot; he recalls. &quot;They almost never had a
<br>
financial plan. Or, if they did, it was nine months out of date, and no one
<br>
was taking it seriously. At first, I thought that they had a stupidity
<br>
problem. But then I realized: This was an information-flow problem.&quot;
<br>
<p>Everyone agrees: The real-time Internet will eventually form the basis of
<br>
how businesses manage their internal data. But pay close attention to that
<br>
sneaky little word &quot;eventually.&quot; The weakened economy of 2001 has led to
<br>
sharp cutbacks in IT investment. At a time when the real-time Internet is
<br>
arguably coming into its own as a transformative business tool, many big
<br>
companies are choosing to defer or even halt their initiatives on this
<br>
front.
<br>
<p>That's irksome to pioneers like Vivek Ranadive, 43, chairman and CEO of
<br>
Tibco Software, in Palo Alto, California. In the 1990s, Tibco ( along with a
<br>
predecessor business ) grew by selling real-time Internet technology to
<br>
financial institutions. More recently, it has expanded its customer base to
<br>
encompass such industries as energy, retailing, and transportation.
<br>
<p>But this year, Tibco's expansion has stalled. In March, the company
<br>
announced that revenue growth would not meet Wall Street expectations. In
<br>
April, it laid off 200 people, or 15% of its workforce. And over the course
<br>
of the spring, its stock-market value -- which had peaked last summer at an
<br>
eye-popping $30 billion -- slumped to a still-strong but far-from-dazzling
<br>
$2 billion.
<br>
<p>&quot;Using software like ours should be part of a company's basic mission,&quot;
<br>
argues Ranadive. &quot;We've got 1,000 customers, including the likes of Chevron,
<br>
Enron, and Yahoo. Some 60% to 70% of the world's semiconductor manufacturing
<br>
is done at companies that use our systems. But we're seeing some
<br>
stretch-outs on orders.&quot;
<br>
<p>Consider Tim Plzak. He's leading an advanced-technology initiative for the
<br>
Limited Co. and its sister retailer, Intimate Brands Inc. The two companies,
<br>
both based in Columbus, Ohio, became Tibco customers last December and are
<br>
now integrating Tibco software into their existing IT structures. Plzak, 39,
<br>
remains a big believer in the real-time Internet. &quot;Right now, only about 20%
<br>
of what we do is real-time, and the rest is batch,&quot; he says. &quot;Over the next
<br>
several years, I'd like to see us go to 50% real-time.&quot;
<br>
<p>Plzak is especially excited about the chance to track the Limited's best
<br>
customers as they travel from store to store. &quot;Say that someone buys
<br>
something at one of our Bath &amp; Body Works outlets,&quot; he says. &quot;If we knew
<br>
right away that this customer had recently bought something from Victoria's
<br>
Secret -- or from any of our other stores -- we could give her a special
<br>
offer for that store when she made her purchase at Bath &amp; Body Works.&quot;
<br>
<p>Equally alluring to Plzak is the prospect of charting how a special
<br>
promotion is faring hour by hour. That way, if a new item made no impression
<br>
at 10 stores, even as it sold briskly at 20 other outlets, managers could
<br>
instantly take steps to figure out whether, say, a shipping glitch was to
<br>
blame. Right now, it takes about a day for point-of-sale data to get back to
<br>
headquarters, and even a daylong wait can impose a serious handicap on
<br>
decision making -- especially during a peak holiday selling season.
<br>
<p>But Plzak warns that real-time data mastery probably won't be at hand for
<br>
his company until sometime after 2002. While he praises the adaptability of
<br>
the Tibco software, he notes that it functions mainly as an overlay on the
<br>
Limited's existing systems for monitoring sales, inventory, and so forth.
<br>
Building seamless connections between old and new software will mean months
<br>
of work for the Limited's computing department, and a rollout isn't likely
<br>
to begin until this year's holiday selling season has come and gone.
<br>
<p>In other cases, customers are opting for more serious delays in their plans
<br>
to implement real-time Internet technology. Allegiance Telecom Inc., based
<br>
in Dallas, had been moving to adopt technology that would help the company
<br>
track how its repair teams process jobs in the field. Its software vendor --
<br>
Vitria Technology Inc., of Sunnyvale, California -- had even posted an
<br>
Allegiance case study on its Web site. Nice idea; nasty timing. &quot;That
<br>
project has been put on hold,&quot; says Steve Taff, 41, director of
<br>
operational-systems support at Allegiance. &quot;We've got other priorities right
<br>
now. We'll probably still do it, but it's likely to be next year before we
<br>
go ahead.&quot;
<br>
<p>At companies that have made the transition to real-time Internet technology,
<br>
leaders report that this move has been well worth any hassles associated
<br>
with it. Ashok Chandran, for example, has been using Closedloop's Web-based
<br>
software for nearly a year to handle spending and P&amp;L forecasts for his
<br>
division at JDS Uniphase, in San Jose. &quot;We used to do all of that on basic
<br>
spreadsheets,&quot; says Chandran, 41, controller for the amplified-components
<br>
division. &quot;That approach was just barely manageable when we were in 3
<br>
buildings and had about 400 people. But now that we're in 10 buildings
<br>
worldwide and have more than 3,000 people, we need something different.&quot;
<br>
<p>Real-time data access is already paying off, Chandran says. It's helping his
<br>
division adjust not only to sudden zigzags in demand but also to
<br>
fast-changing business requirements. If there's a sudden need to alter
<br>
spending patterns in R&amp;D, for example, the division can now set a goal and
<br>
then translate that goal almost instantly into targets for each department.
<br>
<p>To Chandran's delight, managers in his division are actually welcoming the
<br>
new technology. &quot;I've never seen that before,&quot; he says. &quot;Usually, they hate
<br>
new financial systems. They call them bean-counter exercises. But that's not
<br>
happening here.&quot;
<br>
<p>Boosters of real-time Internet technology caution that faster data
<br>
management will not, on its own, ensure better corporate performance. &quot;Just
<br>
because you can see something doesn't mean that you can manage it,&quot; warns
<br>
Sankaran, of Closedloop Solutions. &quot;If you encounter a sharp hairpin turn at
<br>
70 MPH -- which is what's happened to a lot of technology companies --
<br>
better visibility may only give you a brief chance to apply the brakes
<br>
before you crash anyway.&quot;
<br>
<p>Still, in a business world that moves at such speeds, information today
<br>
beats information tomorrow. &quot;We think we can give companies an extra 30 days
<br>
to react to sudden changes,&quot; says Sankaran. &quot;At the end of the day, you
<br>
still need to make managerial judgments. But we can update you as much as
<br>
possible, so that you can make those judgments without having your own data
<br>
systems slow you down.&quot;
