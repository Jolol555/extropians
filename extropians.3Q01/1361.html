<em>&gt;&gt;It seems your analogy actually works against your convictions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm.  :-(  This is why I kept reminding people that I am *not* against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism -- I am just scared of people adhering to it as a religion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Capitalism alone will work... really it will. Have faith.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I was not saying your conviction was &quot;against capitalism,&quot; but it was
<br>
certainly for a mixed economy.
<br>
<p>Have I here or anywhere told you to &quot;[h]ave faith&quot; in the free market?  I've
<br>
actually provided arguments and data (or places to look up data).  You have
<br>
not really answered these.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A quick response to your point of bank deregulation: The biggest disaster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Australian banking was when our government of idiots swallowed that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propaganda about deregulation, hook line and sinker. They deregulated the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; banks, and since then banking costs to the consumer have spiraled upward,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the banks have been closing local branches everywhere, and they have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making record profits.
</em><br>
<p>I'd need to know more details about the case -- and I suspect you need to
<br>
too.:)
<br>
<p>In the US, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Savings &amp; Loans were
<br>
&quot;deregulated.&quot;  Specifically, restrictions were loosened on what they could
<br>
invest in.  However, the FSLIC -- deposit insurance for the Savings &amp;
<br>
Loans -- was NOT disbanded.  In other words, these banks -- the Savings &amp;
<br>
Loan institution -- were allowed to invest more wildly without having truly
<br>
to pay the cost of this.  What did this encourage?  Riskier behavior,
<br>
eventually leading to the S &amp; L Crisis, the FSLIC went broke because of all
<br>
the bailouts and, to prevent the whole system from collapsing, the Federal
<br>
government bailed out the FSLIC with taxpayer money.  (See Catherine
<br>
England's &quot;The Savings and Loan Debacle&quot; and Lawrence J. White's &quot;What has
<br>
been Braking U.S. Banks?&quot; in _Critical Review_ 7(2-3) [Spring-Summer 1993]
<br>
for a more detailed analysis of this crisis.  _Critical Review_'s web site
<br>
is at <a href="http://www.criticalreview.com/">http://www.criticalreview.com/</a>)
<br>
<p>Most comentators believed that the Savings and Loan Crisis was caused by
<br>
deregulation and from that derived the notion that deregulation does not
<br>
work.  However, when you look at the data, it's deposit insurance that is to
<br>
blame and the particular deregulatory path taken with regards to the Savings
<br>
and Loans enhanced the problems with deposit insurance.  Yes, Savings and
<br>
Loans, and in fact all banks, showed be allowed to diversify, BUT they
<br>
should also bear the costs of such.  Removing both the limits on their
<br>
investments _as well as_ deposit insurance would have made for a less
<br>
regulated banking system that was more robust and stable, as banks that made
<br>
bad loans would be more likely to fail, thereby making it more likely that
<br>
banks would watch who they loaned money to and developed better standards
<br>
for deciding.  They would have incentives to do so.  Deposit insurance --
<br>
the FSLIC, in this case -- only funded their bad behavior.  Hence, the
<br>
crisis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Government was originally formed (if I remember my history correctly) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give the population some way to control the powerful individuals (lords,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kings, and barons) that oppressed people.
</em><br>
<p>I've always thought kings, etc. were the government.  You seem to mean
<br>
representational government and not government in general.  Regardless of
<br>
why governments are formed, we must look at how they actually function and
<br>
what certain policies result in.  The view that government somehow can and
<br>
will do the right thing is merely an assumption -- worse, one that does not
<br>
stand up to close scrutiny.
<br>
<p>Does this mean private individuals or firms can and will do the right thing?
<br>
They are not angels either, but a free market generally insures that those
<br>
who do get rewarded and those who don't eventually go broke.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, government can step
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into those same nasty shoes and can be just as dangerous to the people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. It doesn't matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if that power is in the hands of government, or big companies, or powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals. It all comes to the same thing.
</em><br>
<p>Truly, but the way big companies and individuals usually get power is by
<br>
taking control of or getting favors from the government.  In fact, the
<br>
latter is almost always the case.  Companies use regulations to keep out
<br>
competitors or to get subsidies.  Individuals can do the same.  It all
<br>
requires that a regulatory state exists in the first place.  If the
<br>
government's power was limited in the extreme, then less of this predation
<br>
would go on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have a new religion taking hold around the world at the moment that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convinces people to let the most powerful companies and individuals rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the planet unopposed in the name of &quot;market forces&quot;. People are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indoctrinated, perversely, to relinquish all control with faith that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invisible hand of the market will balance all things. This, in the face of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innumerable examples of how out-of-control things can get under pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is, right now, we do not have a free market anywhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Heard of the town of the babies with no brains in Brazil? Union
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Carbide's disasters in the third world? Nestles' nasty child murdering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; campaign in Africa? Similar examples can be found of how crazy things get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when royalty or governments have too much power.
</em><br>
<p>I've heard of worse stories.  However, when looked at carefully, we can see
<br>
usually some rights violation and more often than not local governments
<br>
backing it up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Until we find a natural way to stop money and power concentrating in just
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; few hands, we can only work the powers against each other. Use government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a brake upon big business and powerful individuals, bleeding money from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to redistribute it to society at large. Use big business to criticise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and oppose government and royalty and do things more effectively where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible. Use royalty to point out the abuses by government and big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business and sponsor humanitarian projects.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is not that government will curb these tendencies.  Instead,
<br>
what has actually happened is you give more power to the government and more
<br>
people who'd rather get their money the easy way -- having it redistributed
<br>
to them (and I don't mean just poor people, but also big companies trying to
<br>
keep out competition, get a government contract, or loan guarantees) -- put
<br>
in a huge effort to do so.  This is the story of our times and probably the
<br>
story of all time.  The solution here appears obvious: reduce the power of
<br>
government.  (Surely, you can still use it to prevent force and fraud in
<br>
society, but anything beyond that leads to the above.)
<br>
<p>If concentrations of wealth and power are bad, per se, then you have to
<br>
wonder about concentrating them in the government.  What brake wil lthere be
<br>
upon government?  Using big business to do so seems folly, since big
<br>
businesses, typically, want government favors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Things are not back and white -- there are many levels of grey.
</em><br>
<p>Cliches really do not clear things up.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>
