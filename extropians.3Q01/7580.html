<p>Query:
<br>
since BHT has (apparently) killed every enveloped virus in vitro, would it
<br>
have some effect with pox
<br>
<p>In test tube experiments, BHT has successfully inactivated all lipid viruses
<br>
so far tested including herpes virus (Snipes 1975), cytomegalovirus (Kim
<br>
1978), PM2 virus (Cupp 1975), Semliki Forest virus (Kim 1978), Newcastle
<br>
disease virus (Brugh 1977, Winston 1980), Phi-6 virus (Wanda 1976, Bamford
<br>
1981) and pseudorabies virus (Pirtle, 1986), at concentrations of BHT that
<br>
have not altered the growth of the host cell culture.
<br>
<p>BHT is reputed to work by interfering with the association of envelope
<br>
proteins and envelope lipids. In this view, BHT gets in between the lipids
<br>
and the hydrophobic regions of the proteins that are normally immersed in
<br>
lipid. By altering the dynamics between these hydrophobic surfaces, the
<br>
structure is destabilized and either disintegrates (as in phi-6 virus) or
<br>
selective proteins become detached (as in herpes).

on a

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually the smallpox virus is based on the vaccinia virus, which is

<em>&gt; where the word &quot;vaccine&quot; comes from.  The medical name for the smallpox
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virus is variola.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vaccinia and variola are part of a family of viruses known as Orthopox
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viruses.  These also include monkeypox and cowpox.  There is a related
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family called Avipox viruses which affect birds.  Researchers who work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with these types of viruses have been the only ones able to get smallpox
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vaccinations in recent years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5010a1.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5010a1.htm</a> provides a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description of the symptoms of smallpox and its progression:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Symptoms of smallpox begin 12--14 days (range: 7--17) after exposure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    starting with a 2--3 day prodrome of high fever, malaise, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    prostration with severe headache and backache. This preeruptive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    stage is followed by the appearance of a maculopapular rash (i.e.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    eruptive stage) that progresses to papules 1--2 days after the rash
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    appears; vesicles appear on the fourth or fifth day; pustules appear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    by the seventh day; and scab lesions appear on the fourteenth day
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    (Figures 1,2) (3). The rash appears first on the oral mucosa, face,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    and forearms, then spreads to the trunk and legs (3,4). Lesions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    might erupt on the palms and soles as well. Smallpox skin lesions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    are deeply embedded in the dermis and feel like firm round objects
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    embedded in the skin. As the skin lesions heal, the scabs separate and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    pitted scarring gradually develops (Figure 2) (4). Smallpox patients
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    are most infectious during the first week of the rash when the oral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    mucosa lesions ulcerate and release substantial amounts of virus into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    the saliva. A patient is no longer infectious after all scabs have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    separated (i.e., 3--4 weeks after the onset of the rash).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have been told that emergency workers at hospitals have been given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lists of symptoms of smallpox and other biological warfare agents so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that an attack can be recognized as early as possible.  Here is a
</em><br>
description
<br>
<em>&gt; from the article above of procedures in response to a smallpox attack:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    If an intentional release of smallpox (variola) virus does occur,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    vaccinia vaccine will be recommended for certain groups. Groups for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    whom vaccination would be indicated include
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         persons who were exposed to the initial release of the virus;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         persons who had face-to-face, household, or close-proximity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         contact (&lt;6.5 feet or 2 meters) (84) with a confirmed or suspected
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         smallpox patient at any time from the onset of the patient's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         fever until all scabs have separated;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         personnel involved in the direct medical or public health
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         evaluation, care, or transportation of confirmed or suspected
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         smallpox patients;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         laboratory personnel involved in the collection or processing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         of clinical specimens from confirmed or suspected smallpox
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         patients; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         other persons who have an increased likelihood of contact with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         infectious materials from a smallpox patient (e.g., personnel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         responsible for medical waste disposal, linen disposal or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         disinfection, and room disinfection in a facility where smallpox
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         patients are present).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Using recently vaccinated personnel (i.e., &lt;3 years) for patient care
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    activities would be the best practice. However, because recommendations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    for routine smallpox vaccination in the United States were rescinded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    in 1971 and smallpox vaccination is currently recommended only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    for specific groups (see Routine Nonemergency Vaccine Use), having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    recently vaccinated personnel available in the early stages of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    smallpox emergency would be unlikely. Smallpox vaccine can prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    or decrease the severity of clinical disease, even when administered
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    3--4 days after exposure to the smallpox virus (2,4,85). Preferably,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    healthy persons with no contraindications to vaccination, who can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    be vaccinated immediately before patient contact or very soon after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    patient contact (i.e., &lt;3 days), should be selected for patient care
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    activities or activities involving potentially infectious materials.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Persons who have received a previous vaccination (i.e., childhood
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    vaccination or vaccination &gt;3 years before) against smallpox might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    demonstrate a more accelerated immune response after revaccination
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    than those receiving a primary vaccination (3). If possible, these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    persons should be revaccinated and assigned to patient care activities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    in the early stages of a smallpox outbreak until additional personnel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    can be successfully vaccinated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the good news is that emergency administration of the vaccine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately after exposure can reduce symptoms, and that people over 35
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or so who have been previously vaccinated will respond especially well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to revaccination.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bad news aplenty is available from the New Scientist's series on
</em><br>
bioterrorism
<br>
<em>&gt; at <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/hottopics/bioterrorism/bioterrorism.jsp">http://www.newscientist.com/hottopics/bioterrorism/bioterrorism.jsp</a>.  A
</em><br>

300,
<br>
<em>&gt; begins,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    THE US already has enough smallpox vaccine to defeat most bioterrorist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    attacks with this virus, according to public health officials. Between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    six and seven million people could be treated by the amount of vaccine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    that is currently in the country's stockpiles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but then continues,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Meltzer constructed various models based on the number of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    infected in the attack, and how many other people each of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    can infect. His model predicts that between three and nine million
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    vaccinations would be enough to contain an initial outbreak affecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    a hundred people, but only if at least a third of those infected were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    put in quarantine as soon as they developed the symptoms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we have plenty of doses - as long as only a hundred people were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initially exposed!  And even then we need millions of vaccinations to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handle the outbreak!  This is devastating news because one would suppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the kinds of terrorists we are dealing with today would be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infect far more people than this.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;    The prospect of an anthrax attack was investigated in the 1990s
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    by the US Office of Technological Assessment. They concluded that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    100 kilograms of virulent anthrax effectively dispersed at night
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    over Washington DC could cause between one and three million
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    deaths. Crop-dusters can carry up to twice that capacity.

<em>&gt;
