<p>
Implications?
<br>
<p>Here we have the worst thing could ever happen.
<br>
Not (only) becuase of the losses. This sounds cynical, but 
<br>
I am much more afraid of the implicite implications.
<br>
<p>Secure communication, cryptography and privacy. Forget them.
<br>
These events will clearly be anough to get the support for
<br>
the most draconian laws one can imagine.
<br>
<p>It reminds me at the Reichstag fire in Germany,1933.
<br>
Altough it was probably the deed of a lonely terrorist, it
<br>
gave Hitler the public support against his political opponents.
<br>
<p>Altough the 1933 Germany is very different to the 2001 America,
<br>
it shows that such extreme events can lead to extreme political
<br>
consequencies.
<br>
<p>That time it helped against socialists and jews. Today it
<br>
can help luddites against new technologies.
<br>
<p>I cite from
<br>
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/2001-02-05-binladen.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/2001-02-05-binladen.htm</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Uncrackable encryption is allowing terrorists - Hamas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hezbollah, al-Qaida and others - to communicate about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their criminal intentions without fear of outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intrusion,&quot; FBI Director Louis Freeh said last March
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during closed-door testimony on terrorism before a Senate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; panel. &quot;They're thwarting the efforts of law enforcement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to detect, prevent and investigate illegal activities.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>You can guess the consequences...
<br>
<p>Computers can be used by terrorist? Outlaw them!
<br>
Total survaillance for every bit of information!
<br>
We don't have any other choice, do we? Nanotechnology could
<br>
lead to disasters also. (Altough I doubt that politicians
<br>
will recognize its potentials too early.) Prevent it! 
<br>
<p>Bush said: &quot;The freedom is attacked.&quot; I fear: we will
<br>
defend our freedom so strong that we won't have any anymore.
<br>
<p>I am afraid that the terrorists will succeed in attacking it,
<br>
this time...
