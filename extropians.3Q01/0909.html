John,

<em>&gt;    I think Greg Burch perceptively stated recently how the transcendant vision of       transhumanism does have a connection to the fondest hopes of &quot;aspiring to higher           things&quot; in religious though.

<p>Yes.  The transcendent super-meme pervades a lot of religion and
<br>
extropianism as well.  We might want to note and take advantage
<br>
of that.

<p>Actually, attempting to gather all who really want transcendence
<br>
and are willing to be use all means possible to acheive it and
<br>
an attempt to get various types of such people to understand one
<br>
another a little better.

<em>&gt;   FM-2030 in his book, &quot;Are you a Transhuman?&quot; made a similar point about how     people in various ways have transhumanist aspects to their lives, even if on the     surface you would not think so.
