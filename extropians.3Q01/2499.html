Russell Blackford, reasonable as ever, writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's just that some of the statements I was reading struck me as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under-theorised, hence my comment (but who knows?). E.g the &quot;taxation is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theft&quot; meme seems to avoid questions about when is it and is it not *morally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable* to have legal norms relating to property based on considerations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar to Locke's theory, or the homesteading theory? When is it *morally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable* to qualify such property laws with laws relating to an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obligation to pay taxes (to contribute to social aims etc)?
</em><br>
<p>My own view of &quot;taxation is theft&quot; might not be too far from yours.
<br>
You're right there is a continuum here.  I gave some examples 
<br>
earlier where taxes could be necessary in a modern country that
<br>
is based on any human culture that I've seen.  Namely, if your
<br>
group already maintains a very high level of liberty, and you
<br>
don't want to lose it, then resistence to invaders damn near
<br>
justifies any means.
<br>
<p>I see the &quot;taxation is theft&quot; meme as very valuable, if not to
<br>
be taken literally (not by some of us, at least).  The cultural
<br>
tradition that it is wrong to forcibly take from others has
<br>
shown its worth; the more that historically societies were 
<br>
able to follow that tradition, the better they did.  Today's
<br>
disputes often obtain from a clash between modern hyper-rational
<br>
thought and ancient, proven, successful memes like these.  Hayek
<br>
explains all this better than anyone.
<br>
<p>So I am extremely reluctant to argue with the backers of this
<br>
meme, because I believe that great benefit accrues to a society
<br>
that looks with great disdain on taxation, and uses it only as
<br>
as last resort.  Moreover, these people are hardly stupid; they
<br>
may deny it, but if lives or nations are at risk, the principles
<br>
can be compromised.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To me, there's a lot of theorising that needs to be done here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and what I can see of it casts doubt on simple ideas about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;taking what 'belongs' to someone else&quot; or about who first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiates force.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't know, really.  But I understand that libertarianism
<br>
has a huge literature, and I'm only familiar with an incredibly
<br>
tiny bit of it.  I very much enjoy the essays of Mike Lorrey and
<br>
Daniel Ust.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; BTW (this is not in direct response to your comment) I'm really starting to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonder show I should treat discussions of political philosophy on this list. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see myself as in a minority position here in not accepting Randian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarianism or anything that closely resembles it, despite having broadly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian instincts with regard to both social and economic issues. I do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acknowledge that there's some spread of positions among the libertarians - 
</em><br>
<p>Oh yes, surely there is.  And I stay out of intellectual arguments
<br>
where I'm less sure of my position.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All this is interesting, but if I keep speaking up with an alternative vie 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the kind of libertarian philosophy that you, Mike, Felix, Daniel, Ralf, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jerry and (I think) quite a few others all share, I can just see myself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting bogged down in interminable, energy-sapping debate with people whom 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I basically think of, or want to think of, as transhumanist allies.
</em><br>
<p>yes, it can be a tough choice.  I find certain debates rather
<br>
addictive.  But in the past, I eventually tire and move on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I may soon have to move into semi-lurk mode, or at least avoid such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussions, or my energies will just be spread too thinly. Conversely,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I sense that you and the others don't find a lot of value in paragraphs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I might write along the lines of the one above commencing &quot;It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just that...&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Property and the Law&quot; is not a burning issue with me.  Obviously,
<br>
however, I do find your writing interesting enough to seldom miss
<br>
a post (unless it's really on a thread I know I have no interest
<br>
in).  But then I thought that about this thread too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You don't want to go away and spend a lot of time rethinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your most fundamental political beliefs, seeing whether they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on (or perhaps inconsistent with) anything deeper - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and why should you? Life is short for you as well, unless we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; win the battle for transhumanism.
</em><br>
<p>No, but I do have my antenna up---as I think most people, lurkers
<br>
and non-lurkers alike---for evidence that falsifies something that
<br>
I believe.  Of course, whether I can internalize such dissonance
<br>
before months have passed is another question.  I think that the
<br>
effect of other people's words have delayed impact in those cases
<br>
where people seem poles apart.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But, in that case, I'm asking myself why should I do a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole lot of philosophising that simply drains me and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't of value to the list?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, there is no doubt that philosophizing by people like
<br>
you is of enormous benefit to the list.  It keeps the
<br>
quality a lot higher than it would be otherwise, and very
<br>
much helps keep the tone civil and rational (I think 
<br>
that you do better than I).
<br>
<p>But a lot of people apparently have very different 
<br>
strategies for dealing with the overwhelming amount
<br>
of material on lists like these.  Most people I know
<br>
simply stay away.  Others are very, very choosy about
<br>
which threads to even read, let alone reply on.  I too
<br>
regret some of the time I've spent in political debates
<br>
that I would have enjoyed spending more elsewhere, but
<br>
the stimulation is sometimes irresistable.
