<p><p>Some people have written to me for more details about the blasphemy
<br>
conviction of Dr. Younus Shaikh in Pakistan, for which he has been
<br>
sentenced to death. I have therefore appended an account from the
<br>
International New York Times at the end of this post. (An issue of

Newsweek was recently banned in Pakistan for its coverage of this

controversy.) For additional details, see:

<br>
<p>Rationalist International is an excellent worldwide organization based

in India. It recently issued the following appeal:
<br>
<p>&quot;Sanal Edamaruku, president of Rationalist International, and convenor
<br>
of the Dr. Shaikh Defense Committee has started discussions and
<br>
negotiations with selected diplomatic missions at New Delhi to identify
<br>
a country offering asylum or resident visa to Dr. Shaikh if he is
<br>
released.
<br>
<p>&quot;Meantime over a thousand letters are already sent to the President of
<br>
Pakistan (<a href="mailto:CE@pak.gov.pk?Subject=Re:%20Blasphemy%20in%20Pakistan&In-Reply-To=&lt;002301c13979$7f76c240$c287ecd1@neptune&gt;">CE@pak.gov.pk</a>) by e-mail, pleading for the release of Dr.

<p>Pakistani Sentenced to Death for Blasphemy
<br>
By CELIA W. DUGGER
<br>
<p>EW DELHI, Aug. 19 - Dr. Younus Shaikh, a physiology teacher who earned
<br>
$89 a month at a small college on the second floor of a shopping plaza
<br>
in Pakistan, was convicted there on Saturday and sentenced to death on
<br>
charges of blaspheming the Prophet Muhammad.
<br>
<p>Dr. Shaikh, who has a week to appeal the decision, is one of hundreds of
<br>
people jailed in Islamic Pakistan on blasphemy charges that carry a
<br>
mandatory death sentence, whether the offense was intentional or not.
<br>
The blasphemy law has more typically been applied to religious
<br>
minorities, but Dr. Shaikh is the third Muslim convicted.
<br>
<p>He was arrested in October after some of his students went to a group of
<br>
fundamentalist teachers of Islam to complain that he had been uttering
<br>
possibly blasphemous things in class.
<br>
<p>The students said he had told them that the Prophet had not become a
<br>
Muslim until age 40 and that before then, he had not followed Muslim
<br>
practices concerning circumcision or removing his underarm hair. The
<br>
Movement for the Finality of the Prophet, well known for pursuing
<br>
blasphemers, filed a criminal complaint and sent a mob to the college
<br>
and the local police station, threatening to set them on fire.
<br>
<p>Dr. Shaikh said in interview earlier this year at the Adiala jail in
<br>
Rawalpindi that he had addressed questions in his classroom about
<br>
whether Muhammad had been circumcised before receiving God's revelations
<br>
at 40, and only remembers saying the Prophet's tribe did not follow that
<br>
practice.
<br>
<p>His family brought their own teachers to court - from a different
<br>
chapter of the same group that brought the charges - to argue that the
<br>
doctor had not committed blasphemy because all his remarks dealt with
<br>
the period before Muhammad had declared his prophethood.
<br>
<p>Pakistan's leaders have acknowledged that the law needs to be revised.
<br>
The minister for religious affairs, Mahmood Ghazi, a strong advocate of
<br>
the law, has nonetheless said most cases originate from &quot;ill will and
<br>
personal prejudice.&quot;
<br>
<p>Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, last year suggested a
<br>
procedural change that would have required that blasphemy cases be
<br>
reviewed by local officials before an arrest. But he quickly backed down
<br>
when fundamentalists protested in the streets.
<br>
<p>Dr. Shaikh has been championed by the International Humanist and Ethical
<br>
Union, a group with which he has been associated. The group issued a
<br>
statement today denouncing the intimidating presence of what it called
<br>
&quot;murderous and menacing fundamentalist clergy&quot; in the courtroom during
<br>
Dr. Shaikh's trial.
<br>
<p>&quot;The civilized world should shudder at the news,&quot; the statement said,
<br>
&quot;that in this century a human being can be tried and eventually be
<br>
killed by Pakistan's brutal Islamic state for merely saying that neither
<br>
Prophet Muhammad nor his parents could logically have been Muslims
<br>
before Islam was revealed to the Prophet.&quot;
