<p>The President is certainly free to cite God, just as the murderers of
<br>
9/11 almost certainly did. I think the discussion here is whether such
<br>
citations are proper for a leader in his position as the President of us
<br>
all, and more generally whether the nonreligious should in any way
<br>
dissemble their lack of faith. Had the President spoken specifically
<br>
from the perspective of a Methodist or whatever brand of Xian he is, or
<br>
even just as a Xian, with the assumption that everyone else saw things
<br>
that same way, he would have been criticized as intolerant and
<br>
exclusionary. However when atheists are not taken into account nobody
<br>
seems to give a damn. This snubbing certainly indicates that atheists
<br>
are less worthy, which is exactly how many persons feel. The President
<br>
could lapse into any sort of bigoted speech, it's his right, but I don't
<br>
cotton to him or anybody else promoting prejudice, no matter what the
<br>
circumstance.
<br>
<p>I hardly view anything to do with religion and our society's virtually
<br>
universal approval of this form of voluntary dementia as a side issue
<br>
after 9/11. We now find ourselves embroiled in what is, at its essence,
<br>
a religious war, whether or not we choose to acknowledge it as such.
<br>
Henceforth when one catalogs the horrors of religion down through the
<br>
ages, that date can be added to the list as a stark reminder that we're
<br>
far from out of this age of darkness yet. In addition to inspiring those
<br>
grim events, religious thinking deeply influences much of our nation's
<br>
policies, for the worse, from what I can tell. In the last couple of
<br>
weeks I have found myself becoming a lot less tolerant of other people's
<br>
stupidity, lack of intellectual integrity, or whatever you want to call
<br>
the particular set of superstitions we term &quot;religion.&quot; It cannot be
<br>
defended as just a benign psychological aberration. It kills.
