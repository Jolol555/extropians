<p>WARNING:  Do NOT calculate Pi in binary.  It is conjectured that this
number is normal, meaning that it contains ALL finite bit strings.
<p>If you compute it, you will be guilty of:
<p>* Copyright infringement (of all books, all short stories, all
  newspapers, all magazines, all web sites, all music, all movies,
  and all software, including the complete Windows source code)
* Trademark infringement
* Possession of child pornography
* Espionage (unauthorized possession of top secret information)
* Possession of DVD-cracking software
* Possession of threats to the President
* Possession of everyone's SSN, everyone's credit card numbers,
  everyone's PIN numbers, everyone's unlisted phone numbers, and
  everyone's passwords
* Defaming Islam.  Not technically illegal, but you'll have to go
  into hiding along with Salman Rushdie.
* Defaming Scientology.  Which IS illegal -- just ask Keith Henson.
<p>Also, your computer will contain all of the nastiest known computer
viruses.  In fact, all of the nastiest POSSIBLE computer viruses.
<p>Some of the files on my PC are intensely personal, and I for one
don't want you snooping through a copy of them.
<p>You might get away with computing just a few digits, but why risk it?
There's no telling how far into Pi you can go without finding the secret
documents about the JFK assassination, a photograph of your neighbor's six
year old daughter doing the nasty with the family dog, or a complete copy of
the not-yet-released Pearl Harbor movie.  So just don't do it.
<p>The same warning applies to e, the square root of 2, Euler's constant, Phi,
the cosine of any non-zero algebraic number, and the vast majority of all
other real numbers.
<p>There's a reason why these numbers are always computed and shown in decimal,
after all.
