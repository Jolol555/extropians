</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me be sure I have this straight...  You are suggesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; getting rid of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; (free) public school where the student:teacher ratio is ~
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 30:1 and having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; every family pay $2K - $5K per year (per kid) for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; student:teacher ratio is 50:1?  Is that *really* what you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; suggesting, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; am I missing something?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; -Zero
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Your choice here is McDonalds Hamburgers, eating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at nice dinner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Chilis retaurant, or Filet Mingon from an expensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restaurant. All options
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;would be available!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course the only real options would be available to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealthy.  The rest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of us would be relegated to sending our kids to the $.99
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Store school.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that to some it seems only right that only the rich are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entitled first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate educations for their kids.  To me, that just doesn't sit right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The simple fact is that a welfare mother is not likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to afford
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pay *anything* to educate her children.  If public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education is abandoned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the only alternative for the truly poor would be the school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of hard knocks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, that's the equivolent of saying &quot;let them eat cake.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Woe to all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us if/when that day ever comes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Zero
</em><br>
<p>I noticed how you state everyone would be piled up on the &quot;$.99&quot; store part
<br>
of the scale. You know as well as I do that wouldnt be the case. You would
<br>
see a bell curve distribution that is tilted AWAY from the low end ( the
<br>
distortion that makes it lean away from the low end is because of the
<br>
operation of charity based oganizations). You need to get beyond this robin
<br>
hood idea of &quot;fairness justifies theft&quot;. Besides, the $.99 version of a
<br>
liberatarian school would still probably be better then your average normal
<br>
school today. Dont forget market force efficiencies.
<br>
<p>Look, theres a ton of forces you neglect in your simplistic picture your
<br>
painting. Besides charity based organizations, there would be other novels
<br>
structures that would arise. i.e. Corporations funding exducation in return
<br>
for time served after they graduate, student load investment exchanges
<br>
popping up. I think weve heard that saying &quot;Why did you rob that bank...
<br>
Cause thats where the money is!&quot;. This type of moral bottomfeeding must
<br>
stop.
