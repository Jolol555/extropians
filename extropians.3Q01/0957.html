<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; About the latter question, there is no shortage of words and

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; phrases in English to distinguish shades of belief.  Articulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; people could easily always find suitable substitution phrases---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; but they didn't do so, and mostly resist doing so.  Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Because what I am speaking of is spiritual in the truest sense I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know and to call it anything else is imho improper.  It is also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; essential if one is to reclaim spirituality from the worst of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the luddites and from the conceptual shrinking it into something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; easily dismissed that too easily misses and disowns what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; believe is important in it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think that terms are often worth fighting for.  But I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wax sympathetic here by giving a very parallel case of my own,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where, perhaps it turns out that I'm doing the same thing as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are---or perhaps not.
</em><br>
<p>Terms are the first thing that must be fought for. If politics is war by
<br>
other means, think of semantics as a topology of the battlefield that is
<br>
fluid underfoot. Who defines the terms of debate determines who occupies
<br>
the high ground. He who has the high ground wins the battle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now a semanticist might retort, &quot;because the term in question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; has so many favorable semantic links, that it's very useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; for the purposes of communication&quot;.  But if this were the case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; then you'd see people who use terms like &quot;God&quot;, &quot;spirituality&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and &quot;synchronicity&quot; qualifying their remarks.  In other words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the terms would always be followed by words like &quot;in the sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of...&quot;, or &quot;-like&quot;, or surrounded by scare-quotes.  But it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't happen.  Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whenever I mention free will, it is ALWAYS in a context that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allows me to thoroughly separate myself from people who believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in souls, and I vigorously criticize non-materialist beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I do so.
</em><br>
<p>There is no need for such to rationally arrive at things like morals and
<br>
free will, or to experience wonder at the universe. The Uncertainty
<br>
Principle is free will in its purest form, and requires no phlogiston
<br>
like 'soul' to prop it up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's maybe what is not parallel in our cases.  Do you actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separate yourself from all those &quot;luddites&quot; as you called them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by also ALWAYS disparaging their beliefs while putting forth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own about &quot;spirituality&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>What she and several others have defined here as 'spiritual' is not a
<br>
new definition, it has always been an alternative/subset definition of
<br>
the term, where you see 'spirit' in terms of 'elan', 'gumption', and
<br>
'empathy'. Supernatural need not apply. The extra-physical realm of
<br>
circular unverifiable arguments that religion has retreated to in the
<br>
modern age is simply a defense mechanism to protect a faulty belief set
<br>
against the onset of logic and critical cross examination.
<br>
<p>A large part of the population is unable to develop the faculties for
<br>
objective logic and cross examination, and in their blindness they
<br>
develop weak ideas about the world they keep bumping into but cannot see
<br>
for the lack of logical sight, while claiming that their theories are
<br>
valid because their sense of touch is better than ours...
<br>
<p>The universe is amazing, and we are frightfully small and
<br>
inconsequential in it. Much of it we have yet to understand fully, but
<br>
the lack of any true gopher holes in the landscape of our knowledge
<br>
indicates that there likely is no Wonderland to reach from such
<br>
non-existent gopherholes. That doesn't mean the view isn't fine from
<br>
here.
