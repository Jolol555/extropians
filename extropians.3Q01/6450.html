<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;One of the better solutions I've heard today is to train the stewards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;in security.  Give them batons and tasers, normally concealed under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;their uniforms (don't want to *look* threatening), and make sure they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;know how to use them.  The number of ways a passenger-turned-terrorist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;can try to take over a plane is limited; most of them can probably be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;programmed into simulators for training against.  Main objective is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;prevent hijacking, but this might also be useful day-to-day in cases of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;severe air rage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; This might work against a lone terrorist, but the cellphone calls
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; that came from the planes indicated that there were as many as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; half-dozen hijackers per plane.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Fine.  There's *how* many stewards?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's ask, and also ask about the height, weight, gender and combat training of the average stew.
</em><br>
<p>H/W/G: some of the most effective martial artists I know are short,
<br>
light females.  The difference?  Combat training - which is what I'm
<br>
suggesting be supplied.  (And attitude, granted, but the training can
<br>
teach them to control attitude as necessary.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;And the stewards could gang up on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;each terrorist, while the terrorists would have to disperse since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;they're monitoring all the passengers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seem to think that there are dozens of them per plane.  Who have YOU been flying with?
</em><br>
<p>&lt;shrugs&gt;  Taking down one or two terrorists at a time should be easily
<br>
for a trained and properly armed team of three or four.  Frankly, one
<br>
or two trained fighters can whip any small mob of gun-toting fanatics
<br>
randomly plucked from the dregs of society (those having the least to
<br>
lose by dying).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;BTW, to those who suggested guns: I suggested batons and tasers because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;they don't punch holes in the aircraft hull...and they tend to be less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;deadly to any hostages or other bodies that happen to get in the way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Killing an enemy is not always the best way to remove the threat they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;represent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, the best way I've seen advocated onlist is cockpit security.  But we're gonna have sky marshals anyway; let's hope they're not like elderly bank guards, and know how to retain and use the weapons they're issued, while avoiding depressurizing the plane in the process.
</em><br>
<p>Which is why I also suggested recertifying the security training every
<br>
so often.  Skills that are allowed to degrade to scraps aren't that
<br>
useful.
<br>
<p>BTW, the reason I suggest this instead of a specific Sky Marshal: the
<br>
stewards will normally be out and about, justifying their employment
<br>
and not dozing off, if terrorists attack.  Plus, arming the stewards
<br>
gaurantees you'll have more than one security officer; single-purpose
<br>
Sky Marshals would likely be reduced to just 1 for budget reasons (not
<br>
to mention, wasting space on the 99+% of flights where they are not
<br>
needed).
