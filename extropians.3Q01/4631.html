</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Last time this topic came up, I started reading up on the history of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education in the U.S. and basically came to the conclusion that public
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education is a bad idea.  The nice part is that we have a fair amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;historical data to prove it, since the very first state to adopt public
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education was Massachusetts in 1850 and there are lots of good records
</em><br>
<em>&gt;preceding that for at least a century.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As Alexis de Tocqueville noted many times, the early Americans were
</em><br>
probably
<br>
<em>&gt;the most literate and best educated people in the world at that time, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the average hard-working American was frequently as well-educated as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;upper class in most parts of Europe.  While the deep frontier only had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;literacy rate of around 65%, virtually all the settled regions had literacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rates in excess of 90%.  In some locales, literacy rates were in the 98-99%
</em><br>
<em>&gt;range.  It is ironic that the first state to adopt public education,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Massachusetts, has a lower literacy rate today than when they had when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adopted public education in the middle of the 19th century.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When private schools were the only option, there was fierce competition
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt;made high-quality cheap education available to essentially everyone.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;market accommodated every level of society, from the very rich to the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;poor, such that no one missed out on an education by the lack of resources.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Education was viewed as an essential social good, but society supported
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt;through the private market rather than through public institutions.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problems started when the states decided that public education was a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;idea.  Because the &quot;free&quot; education was subsidized with taxes, the vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt;majority of private schools at all levels of the market went bankrupt
</em><br>
within
<br>
<em>&gt;a decade of the adoption of public education.  In virtually every case, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adoption of public education was followed by a rapid drop in literacy rates
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and education in general, drops that in many cases have persisted to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;After doing some research a while back, I basically went from agnostic to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being firmly in the anti-public school camp.  The track record of public
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education in this country has been disasterous for the most part, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem is that so many people are used to sucking off the government teat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that they are unwilling to exercise their right to something better.

<p>This is true for other countries as well as the US - plenty of work on the
<br>
British case for example. Here we have just officially confirmed that the
<br>
under 35s have a lower standard of literacy than was the case before WW I!
<br>
On a slightly different point, bearing in mind the nature of this list, is
<br>
nobody else struck by how backward education is and lacking in innovation
<br>
compared to other areas of life? I'm also struck by the way most people
<br>
assume education=schooling. Surely, with modern technology there must be
<br>
more that one method of delivering education. it's like assuming there's
<br>
only one possible kind of food store. Like James, I think state education is
<br>
unbelievably bad at its purported task - a language school can teach most
<br>
people conversational fluency in a foreign language in about 80 hours. Most
<br>
British pupils can't manage anything like that after 5years of secondary
<br>
education. Education is clearly an important &quot;public good&quot; because of the
<br>
neighbourhood effects alluded to in another post but we certainly need to
<br>
think about better ways of producing it. Steve Davies
