<em>&gt;&gt;Hmm, do you mean that since some philosophers thought comprehension of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;eudaimonia was not possible for the many and the singularity is also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;incomprehensible, there is a link? That sounds rather far-fetched.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really? What exactly do you find far-fetched? It seems to me that in both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases there is said to be an epistemic gap between (t least some) humans and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those that are more godlike in their wisdom. If this epistemic similarity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not sufficient to constitute a link reflect on the fact that it seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raise the same sorts of ethical and political consequences. If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postsingularity beings are wiser than us then they may have a better idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what are eudaimonia consists in than we do; which is analogous to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position Plato attributes to the philosopher-king as compared with the hoi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polloi. Plato thought the philosopher-kings and the guardians would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified in bringing the many into line by force and deceit. Will the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postsingularity beings be similarly justified?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
...
<br>
<p><p>Only to the extent that you accept that those who are currently 
<br>
wiser than others are justified in using force to compell the 
<br>
less wise to their views.  I think that's a generally 
<br>
discredited postulate, but if you do accept it, then I guess 
<br>
that the answer to you question would be yes.
<br>
<p>Notice that this doesn't really have anything to do with the 
<br>
singularity at all.  And when the post-singularity beings 
<br>
appear, everyone will be post singularity.  (Assuming that it 
<br>
happens at some point in time rather than that it's a part of a 
<br>
continuing process.  I consider this unlikely.)
<br>
<p>A similarity or two between a couple of processes isn't 
<br>
sufficient to call them the same, or even closely related. 
<br>
Sometimes it's sufficient to make a coarse grouping, e.g., live 
<br>
vs. dead or unicellular vs. multicellular, but please notice 
<br>
just how broad these categories are.  Oysters and Orangutans not 
<br>
only are both multi-cellular, but both of them have names 
<br>
begining with O.  But there are perhaps as many differences 
<br>
between them as similarities (or perhaps not, but there sure are 
<br>
a lot of differences).
