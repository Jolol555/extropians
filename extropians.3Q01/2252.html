<em>&gt; Olga Bourlin writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm so sorry they aren't paying MD-PHds more than poor working people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wages these days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It really would be best for all concerned to avoid personal references
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this.  Surely, with practice, we can all learn to make our points
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without venturing dangerously close to the ad hominem ...
</em><br>
<p>You're 100% right, Lee.  I apologize for the sarcasm, and that's sincere.
<br>
<p>Having worked my way through college ... and working, for some years as a
<br>
single parent, at a full-time job where I babysat another working woman's
<br>
children at night (in exchange for having my children babysat), rousing my
<br>
children from sleep to take them home at 2:15 a.m. in the morning (FYI, I
<br>
don't believe in alimony or child support on principle) ... and at another
<br>
time (children grown, but one still in college) having two full-time jobs
<br>
for over three years ... I know something about working and being
<br>
responsible.  (This is not presented as argument, merely as background.)
<br>
<em>&gt;From a libertarian perspective, however, would I be considered a &quot;lazy&quot;
</em><br>
person because I put my children through public schools?
<br>
<p>Also, I know
<br>
<em>&gt; that the temptation to sarcasm is strong---especially when one feels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outnumbered.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not certain what you mean by feeling outnumbered.  Outnumbered because
<br>
of my politics?  Certainly not outnumbered when it comes to some other
<br>
criteria.  Perhaps it's my scrappy immigrant background that contributes to
<br>
my sarcastic perspective - I've been saddled with it all my life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In a society of millions, or hundreds of millions, some people's economic
</em><br>
worth
<br>
<em>&gt; to others (sometimes as in the case of movie stars or baseball players,
</em><br>
millions
<br>
<em>&gt; of others) will be vastly, vastly more than other's economic worth.
</em><br>
Should
<br>
<em>&gt; school teachers be paid more than movie stars?  Who is to say?  The answer
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; not some committee that will force their decision on others, but people
</em><br>
freely
<br>
<em>&gt; choosing with their dollar-votes.
</em><br>
<p>But which committee decides the worth of those dollar-votes?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, sometimes the differences are obscene.
</em><br>
<p>So are you saying, &quot;so what?&quot;  I'm only glad the libertarians weren't in
<br>
&quot;charge&quot; during the Civil Rights Movement.  The differences, obscene as they
<br>
are now, would have been even more so.  Where would we be now - still living
<br>
in a segregated society?  Upholding the privilege of people's being able to
<br>
choose exclusively &quot;with their dollar votes&quot; would have relegated many other
<br>
people to de jure segregation, at best (and that's from the optimistic
<br>
viewpoint that somehow even libertarians would by now have been on the side
<br>
of disbanding de facto segregation ... not by force, of course, but by
<br>
exhibiting some conscience and compassion?)   Switching to the utterly
<br>
mundane, thanks for correcting my &quot;obcene&quot; typo, Lee ... I hate it when I do
<br>
that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This is all personal, I realize - but I feel lucky to be healthy,
</em><br>
relatively
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent, productive and, most important, to have the capacity to
</em><br>
enjoy
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; life.  So what if some of my hard-earned money goes to lazy people, or
</em><br>
blind
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people, or schizophrenic people?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That should be your choice.  Not all people think or feel as you do.  Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should they be literally forced to yield up their money?
</em><br>
<p>The point is - &quot;some of my hard-earned money&quot; - not &quot;money,&quot; period.
<br>
Shucks, I believe in contributing to some &quot;general good.&quot;   After all, I use
<br>
&quot;free&quot; resources - as I said before, my children went to public schools
<br>
(yes, I know some people choose not to have children, or else choose not to
<br>
have their children attend public schools, but as I understand it, most
<br>
people - even libertarians - use public roads and highways).  The milk of
<br>
human kindness does not run very deep in humans, it's been my observation.
<br>
Again, I direct you to some of my remarks about the Civil Rights Movement,
<br>
above.
<br>
<p>As an aside (as this was not mentioned in Lee's post to which I am replying)
<br>
regarding Rafal Smigrodzki's solution to helping the poor (not mentioned in
<br>
Lee's post), i.e., &quot;How about providing a guaranteed 1500 kcal of cheapest
<br>
food/day, about 30sq. ft space in a shelter, and other necessities, no
<br>
cash.&quot;
<br>
<p>... I agree with the extrope who quipped this sounds like prison.  And
<br>
that's one of the reasons I said above that I don't feel &quot;outnumbered when
<br>
it comes to some other criteria.&quot;
