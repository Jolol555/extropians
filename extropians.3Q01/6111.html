Perhaps I am thinking first world and I should be thinking third world. But
<br>
I have no idea how someone puts together an operation like this and pulls it
<br>
off with the level of intelligence in place today. Something like this has
<br>
to be planned a long time out and some warnings should have gone off. This
<br>
was not something a dozen individuals thought up last week would be a good
<br>
idea to do.
<br>
<p>Also as I said, 4 airliners not on flight plan? And no red flags are going
<br>
off. If nothing else there should be a scramble to find and track the planes
<br>
for their own protection in case some weird error is happening in the
<br>
nations flight control system.
<br>
<p>And all of this in a situation where individuals have allowed government
<br>
intrusion into their lives, accept four hour check in times, etc just so
<br>
this would not happen.
<br>
<p>To me that is incompetency beyond belief.
