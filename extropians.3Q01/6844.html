<em>&gt; &gt; Some recent postings seem to suggest that we should sacrifice innocents to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Principals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now Harvey, I didn't say that.  What I *attempted* to do was set up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a reasonable extropic &quot;corollary&quot; in line with the Principals --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i.e. the ability to save the greatest number of lives in the shortest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of time is &quot;extropic&quot;.  (People should feel free to attack the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corollary *or* the means of achieving it.)
</em><br>
<p>Let us not mince words.  You suggested blowing an entire nation
<br>
to kingdom come to supposedly advance extropic ideals.  This is
<br>
ludicrous.  Such an action could only greatly harm maximizing
<br>
extropy in the near term.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also object to the use of the term &quot;innocents&quot;, though I do not deny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the use of nuclear weapons would of course kill children whom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one can reasonably consider &quot;innocent&quot;.  An unbiased observation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the demonstrations in the streets of towns in Pakistan neighboring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afganistan would not label the adults involved in these affairs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;innocent&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>More mincing words.  You are talking about killing
<br>
non-combatants.  I don't see how it is reasonable to feel better
<br>
at killing non-combatants if they happen not to like you and
<br>
have been taught all of their life that you are a great
<br>
millstone around their neck and therefore celebrated when they
<br>
saw you successfully attacked.  And also, it is likely only a
<br>
relative handful celebrated.  In any case it is hardly a sane
<br>
response to wipe them out for that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As Samantha pointed out, it may be necessary to prioritize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Principals so that sentients have self-determination privileges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that supercede the other goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now that raises a *very* sticky issue as to what rights one assigns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to (a) irrational individuals; or (b) individuals who are rational but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operating from a fundamentally misinformed belief systems?  [Of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one is free to question the degree to which all Americans or &quot;Western&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals are operating from misinformed belief systems.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>(a) Irrational indivduals have the right to be as irrational as
<br>
they wish as long as they do not interfere with the rights of
<br>
others.  When they do they will be interfered with sufficiently
<br>
to stop their interference with others.  
<br>
<p>Same for (b). 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Given that individuals exist who have been indoctrinated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentally unextropic belief systems -- who have the power or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will to intervene in the extropic directions of free societies -- the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question is &quot;How much are you willing to allow such individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to cost you in extropic productivity?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>See guideline for (a).  What do you mean by &quot;cost&quot;. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think this may be the fundamental question -- &quot;What is the value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a human life whose read-only-memory is based fundamentally on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a set of synthetic fabrications?&quot;  *Particularly* if those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fabrications are likely to represent a threat to individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who base their reality on a more rational examination of the facts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What is this &quot;read-only memory&quot; bs?  Minds are not immutable. 
<br>
If they were we might as well all hang it up.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; How does one tradeoff &quot;human compassion&quot; against &quot;rational meme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triumph&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I do not consider the lack of this type of compassion to be in
<br>
the least &quot;rational&quot;.
