<p><em>&gt;I think the author of this article and Hardin make the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mistake. They see a problem, note that the methods of solving the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem at present are not enough, and then deduce that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem must be solved using their favorite paradigm. But there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are often many ways of solving problems, many of which are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entirely alien to the current paradigm. We have moved beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt;planned inventions and centrally regulated resources in many ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- but many people are still looking more qat the past for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;policies. Hence it is important to read and understand Hardin so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that we can counter the naive interpretations of his ideas that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are still very prevalent. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, everything looks different through the retrospectroscope, but
<br>
I think Hardin's work is still extremely usefull.
<br>
<p>A bunch of years ago we started building a new communications room
<br>
here. Politically it was decided that no one person (meaning me)
<br>
would have any final authority as to what was done there.
<br>
<p>It evolved into a complete disaster, My boss quickly opted out of
<br>
the plan and I got to build our own facilities. Now of course I get
<br>
to completely rebuild the &quot;commons&quot; that got screwed up.
