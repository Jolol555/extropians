THE LIGHTHOUSE: August 13, 2001YANKEE TAX COLLECTOR GO HOME!
<br>
from THE LIGHTHOUSE &quot;Enlightening Ideas for Public Policy...&quot; Vol. 3, Issue
<br>
32 August 13, 2001
<br>
<p>In a disastrous case of &quot;mistaken identity&quot; (all the worse because it was
<br>
intentional), U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala Prudence Bushnell issued a screed
<br>
demonizing Manual Ayau, founder of Guatemala's Francisco Marroquin
<br>
University, as &quot;undemocratic&quot; and an &quot;archetypical far-right Latin oligarch&quot;
<br>
who defends that country's &quot;business elite&quot; against the interests of his
<br>
impoverished fellow citizens.
<br>
<p>It's hard to know where to begin countering those spurious charges.  For
<br>
starters, Ayau's university has for 30 years been Central America's leading
<br>
institution promoting individual rights, the rule of law, and free trade. A
<br>
past president of the Mt. Pelerin Society, the prestigious international
<br>
organization of free-market scholars, Ayau came out publicly against tariff
<br>
protection for his industry in a 1966 newspaper op-ed, making him a social
<br>
pariah in some Guatemalan business circles.
<br>
<p>&quot;If anyone is the opposite of a 'Latin oligarch,' it is Mr. Ayau, who has
<br>
been an utterly gracious, noble, and courageous fighter for the freedom,
<br>
education, and welfare of Guatemalans for decades,&quot; wrote Independent
<br>
Institute president David J. Theroux in a letter to the Wall Street Journal,
<br>
which recently exposed Ambassador Bushnell's unwarranted attack. &quot;In fact,
<br>
he may be the single most important leader for free markets and human
<br>
progress in Central and South America since well before World War II.&quot;
<br>
<p>The reason for slander against Ayau? Apparently, Ayau has been an important
<br>
voice in Guatemalans' protests -- culminating in a recent national strike
<br>
and a massive march on the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala -- to protest a tax on
<br>
Guatemalan workers urged by the United States government at the best of
<br>
American trade unions. Who, then, is defending oligarchy and business
<br>
elites?
<br>
<p>Theroux continues: &quot;We know that empowering the people through
<br>
privatization, free trade and free-market economic development are essential
<br>
to liberate them, and the poor in particular, from the oligarchy of
<br>
government patronage the U.S. has long supported. And we know that U.S.
<br>
government foreign aid and other interventions are anathema to economic and
<br>
social welfare. But it is even more telling to see U.S. Embassy flacks
<br>
pursuing their covert schemes to protect their cherished system of
<br>
government privileges and central planning from a man whose only weapon has
<br>
been ideas. After all, whatever the interests of the public, the jobs of
<br>
U.S. bureaucrats might be at stake if Mr. Ayau's arguments were acted upon.&quot;
