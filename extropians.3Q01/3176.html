<em>&gt; In just this way, we can employ our rationality to help ourselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; move forward.  In this way, we can allow, as you put it, reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into our lives.
</em><br>
<p>Can insight be awakened in another? We were discussing what it is for the
<br>
brain to have no movement. When a human being has been pursuing the path of
<br>
becoming, and has gone through all that, and this sense of emptiness, silence
<br>
and energy, one has abandoned almost everything and come to the point, the
<br>
ground of being. How does this insight affect one's daily life? What is one's
<br>
relationship to society? What is ones\'s action with regard to war, and the
<br>
whole world -- a world that is really living and struggling in ignorance? What
<br>
is one's action? We've seen that it is a non-movement, this ground of being,
<br>
which is movement without division.
<br>
In some sense it seems inconsistent to say non-movement while saying that the
<br>
ground is movement. A certain kind of movement involves average, educated,
<br>
sophisticated people, with all their unpleasant activities, constantly moving,
<br>
moving in time. That movement is becoming. But we are discussing the one who
<br>
has trodden that path, if that is the word, and come to that point, the ground
<br>
of being. From there, what is one's action? For the moment, it is non-action,
<br>
non-movement. What does that mean?
<br>
It means not taking part in this process of becoming, obviously, and if one
<br>
doesn't take part in this process, what part does one play? Is it a part of
<br>
complete non-action? It is non-action in the sense that it is not part of the
<br>
process of becoming, although one still has to live in the world. Of course
<br>
whatever one does is action, but not necessarily directed towards the illusory
<br>
process, and not involved in it, but directed towards what underlies this
<br>
illusory process. It is directed towards considering the wrong turning which
<br>
is continually emerging from the ground. Various religions have described one
<br>
who has achieved something or other, from ancient Hindu religious books, and
<br>
recently a book called _Zen and the Brain_. A great deal of that literature is
<br>
simply imagination and poetic description, though with some it is not like
<br>
that, because they know exactly what it is. How does such a person live in
<br>
this world, in a state of non-movement, the non-movement which we have gone
<br>
into? One becomes poetic about this non-movement: it is like a single tree in
<br>
a field. There is no other tree, but that tree, and it stands without moving,
<br>
and so on... having gone from beginning to end, one has a totally different
<br>
kind of movement, awareness, and has moved out of ignorance.
<br>
It is a constant movement, beyond the deception of romance and poetry, and its
<br>
constancy is timeless. The quality of that movement exceeds pursuing and
<br>
becoming, it has gone through all that and released all that ignorance. What
<br>
does this entirely different being do, or not do, in the world which remains
<br>
in ignorance? It does not enter into the movement of that world, yet it is
<br>
constant -- not fixed, yet it does not move, it is a dynamic constant. From
<br>
the ground of being a movement emerges that is completely free. What has
<br>
happened to it, to make it free of anxiety and fear? Empty of knowledge,
<br>
acting in the light of insight, pervaded by the quality of insight, it remains
<br>
constant in a flash of insight. What does that mean in everyday life? Does it
<br>
affect how one earns a livlihood?
<br>
Is special skill needed to live or does it come naturally? Knowledge and
<br>
experience develop into skill, giving one opportunity to earn a livlihood,
<br>
either meager or rich. But is there a different way of living and earning, a
<br>
way unlike the pattern we are used to (which may be totally wrong)? This does
<br>
not negate ordinary and necessary skills such as driving cars, doing
<br>
carpentry, or operating computers, obviously. Do we need to make a distinction
<br>
between living and earning a livlihood or can one have superficial contact
<br>
with the world while having deep compassion in relation to human beings? And
<br>
what will the world do with one who is so different? Worship, kill, ignore,
<br>
deny? No matter, because the work of coaxing humans out of darkness into the
<br>
light, dispelling ignorance, getting rid of psychological shackles, goes on.
<br>
If people pay for that kind of teaching, it is a means of livlihood. And if
<br>
there were many people doing such teaching, that would be an evolutionary
<br>
phase shift. Such people would not be divided; that is the point of their
<br>
teaching. If even ten or fifteen people were undivided they would exert a
<br>
force that has never been seen in human history. A group of ten undivided
<br>
teachers will bring a totally different kind of revolution. Will society stand
<br>
for that? Yes, it is happening, and humans are awakening to that intelligence
<br>
which dispels ignorance. This is the means of livlihood of an undivided
<br>
teacher. From the ground of being, this teaching emerges more deeply creative.
<br>
Is that all the undivided teachers will do in life? Just to teach people to
<br>
move out of ignorance? It seems to be the prime task at the moment, in the
<br>
sense that, if this doesn't happen, the whole society will sooner or later
<br>
collapse. Yet there is something more immense at work in this. How does this
<br>
direct action operate on humans, and spread? This clarity cannot be confined
<br>
to such a petty affair as human opinion. What is the significance of humans in
<br>
the universe? Something new is possible which no one had discovered before
<br>
science.
<br>
Are we fooling ourselves or is this logical and reasonable? We can have some
<br>
confidence that it is reasonable by exploring this further. See if you can
<br>
detect something about life which is greater than can be put in words. The
<br>
everyday life of sentient beings involves something which does not show,
<br>
something that affects all humans, and is part of existence. It teaches us
<br>
that existence does not need humans, although humans may learn from the
<br>
immensity of existence. The ground of being may employ humans as part of the
<br>
timeless movement of existence, and there is no reason to do anything except
<br>
this. Awakened humans, the ground of being, asking for no result, concerned
<br>
with the whole of humanity, and not interested in proving anything. Existence
<br>
does not need humans, but we have emerged from it, and compassion prompts
<br>
communication with those who have not seen this operation beyond words, cannot
<br>
possibly be put into words. Though existence is full of meaning, it cannot be
<br>
put into words or any political organization. A totally different insight
<br>
touches humanity, based on intelligence and compassion. If the whole of
<br>
mankind sees this, it would be an evolutionary phase transition, paradise on
<br>
earth, an organism of a new kind.
<br>
This immensity cannot be reduced to words or descriptions of how it benefits
<br>
us and affects our future. To bring the light of reason which allows people to
<br>
be open to the immensity is not enough, because we only see a small part, and
<br>
it extends to infinity. So with words we see immensity only as a very small
<br>
thing, and that immensity is the whole multiverse. It seems that this cannot
<br>
fail to have an effect on society, but even though the effect is real, and the
<br>
perception of it is the gate to infinity, and it is in itself a factor of
<br>
change, and can divert the course of mankind away from the dangerous path now
<br>
taken, somebody must listen -- at least a few people must listen.
<br>
Listen to that immensity calling, because it can divert the course of humanity
<br>
and effect an evolutionary phase transition. The individual cannot do it.
<br>
Don't just do something. Sit there and understand that whatever you do, you
<br>
are still living in that circle of ignorance, so don't act, you have nothing
<br>
to do.
