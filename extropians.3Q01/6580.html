Are you completely mad, or just overdoing the drugs?
<br>
<p>Sorry. You just hit a hot-button of mine. You are *supposed* to be an
<br>
extropian -- someone who is dynamically optimistic about the future.
<br>
<p>What the hell kind of optimism is it that goes on about &quot;rebuilding the
<br>
WTC with the bones of dead religious fanatics&quot;?
<br>
<p>What _I_ want to do is to convert those religious fanatics to extropian
<br>
ideals.

<p><em>&gt; &gt; It might

<br>
It's ridiculous, but it's what he believes. Do you really think that
<br>
just because Hitler's beliefs were ridiculous, he didn't believe in them?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; He's probably
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, the west (spell that N - A - T - O) will definitely win, and it will mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we've proven that religious fanatics should all go to the imaginary
</em><br>

</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Er, you may have forgotten that Germany has a muslim population of seven
<br>
million. The UK has a muslim population of three million. France is
<br>
somewhere in-between. The US muslim population is a smaller per-capita
<br>
proportion, but similarly measured in the millions.
<br>
<p>If the goal is to kick the Taliban in the nuts, take their territory away,
<br>
and rebuild Afghanistan, most muslims in the west won't cheer, but they'll
<br>
nod thoughtfully and go along with it. (The Taliban are to the islamic
<br>
world about where Adolf Hitler would stand in relation to the US 
<br>
Republican party.)
<br>
<p>But if it turns into a crusade -- literally, a holy war for the cross,
<br>
against islam, which is what Jerry Fallwell wants -- then what the west
<br>
will have will not be a mere &quot;terrorist problem&quot;; it'll be all-out civil
<br>
war at home.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regressive force now operating in society.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Agreed -- but we won't succeed in doing that if our own response to the
<br>
atrocity is dictated by the likes of Jerry Fallwell, or our &quot;debunking&quot;
<br>
takes the form of further atrocities. The problem with religious memes
<br>
is that subverting them is a difficult job, best done by setting a good
<br>
example and exposing the victim to it and encouraging them to think for
<br>
themselves. Bombing them flat isn't going to help. In fact, it's going to
<br>
reinforce their belief system and spread the hard-line beliefs to people
<br>
who are currently moderates.
