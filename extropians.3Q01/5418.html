<p><em>&gt;&gt;&quot;You claim tire installers are making 50K? how about some proof,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and by the way if it wasn't worth it the company wouldn't pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;it....&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;They dont, instead they close up shop and move south, where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same job can be performed just as well in a cheaper environment. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then, of course, everyone complains that these greedy corporations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are stealing jobs from the US and giving them to mexico, of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these same people turn around and buy cheap imported clothed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;electronics goods, and cars.  Very few of them are willing to pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the extra money for a product required to pay the average american
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worker.  
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Well, there are still some cars made here.
<br>
<p>I still make a very concentrated effort to buy American simply
<br>
because It's important to me that my fellow citizens are gainfully
<br>
employed. &quot;
<br>
<p>I am just curious as to why you would prefer american citizens have jobs
<br>
more then mexican citizens, or chinese citizens.  They are all people, and
<br>
they all have children and loved ones to support.  Why do Americans deserve
<br>
this more then foriegners?  Is it also important to you that we perpetuate
<br>
the economic imbalance between post industrialized nations and 3rd world
<br>
nations? (keep us rich and them poor) because that is what you are
<br>
essentially encouraging.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Lets try a modern day example. Suppose Microsoft was the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;software company in the world. Do you think anyone would be getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;stock options and bonuses or relocation allowances, or would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;programmers be working for minimum wage.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Do you think those people would continue working for microsoft? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or would they quit and start thier own software company?  Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think that other companies wouldnt then decide to enter the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;software market given the potential profit margins? 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;For the point of discussion I was asking for the assumption that
<br>
there was only one company. My points are valid within that
<br>
assumption. I know this isn't a real world scenario, it was a
<br>
simplification.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Pointing out why free markets wont work by imagining a world where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only one producer is allowed isnt valid, as no such world would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exist.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I wasn't attempting any such thing, I was demonstrating the control
<br>
possible under a monopoly.&quot;
<br>
<p>Under a impossible theorhetical monopoly.  What difference does it really
<br>
make how a company that has a perfect monopoly would treat its employees
<br>
when in the real world no such thing can exist?  Maybe I am just missing the
<br>
point you were trying to make.  It seemed you were pointing out the if
<br>
Microsoft were the only company that made software that they wouldnt pay
<br>
thier programmaers squat or give them much for benefits, therefore
<br>
monopolies are bad for employees.  Yet, such a situation can not possible
<br>
exist, and even if it did, employees in sufficiently bad working conditions
<br>
would probably learn another vocation where there is not an absolute
<br>
monopoly on the labor.
