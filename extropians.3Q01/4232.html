<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, IQ tests measure something... but what? About the only answer that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anybody has been able to come up with that makes any sense to me is that IQ 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tests measure how well someone does at IQ tests. I am not being sarcastic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here.
</em><br>
<p>Amen.  My sense, based on the US DOD Basic Battery,
<br>
Mensa's proctored exam, and Chris Whiting's Skyscraper
<br>
exam, is that they reveal the kind of puzzle-solving
<br>
ability that involves pattern perception within a field of
<br>
abstracts, as opposed to, say, the ability to to assemble
<br>
senory impressions in the wild - the hunter's 'field
<br>
sense' - or or to the ability to sense the gestalt of
<br>
another individual or group - the politician's or
<br>
entertainer's ability to 'read' a room accurately.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what does IQ measure? I don't think it really measures how smart someone is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p><p><p>What Terman and his associates were looking for when they
<br>
started the process in ?1916 was a tool that would let
<br>
them select a trainable cadre of technicians - gunners,
<br>
logistics types, and the like - from the herd of draftees.
<br>
The thing that frets me about it is that it has fostered
<br>
the meme that intelligence - or, rather 'IQ' - is a moral
<br>
quality akin to courage or loyalty but superior simply
<br>
because it can be assessed, quantified, and compared - and
<br>
used for prediction of behavior.  Earlier cultures were
<br>
aware of intelligence too but their perceptions of its
<br>
value - embodied in tales of Trickster, Loki, Monkey,
<br>
Odysseus - were a lot more equivocal.
<br>
<p>I think the IQ scores certainly are use*able* in limited
<br>
ways but they never should have become escutcheons.
