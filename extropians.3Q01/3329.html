<p>Oh, ok.  That's actually a bit easier to deal with, since it has
<br>
applications in the here and now.  Specifically, fetal tissue use:
<br>
given an embryo, it is possible to raise it into an independent
<br>
organism or to destroy it so as to harvest something (usually data)
<br>
that may help previously existing organisms.  Some say that, whenever
<br>
faced with this choice, the only ethical decision is to raise the
<br>
embryo - but I disagree, and I suspect most people on this list also
<br>
do.  Certainly, if the owners of the embryo wish to raise it, then it
<br>
should be raised.  But if they do not, then they may dispose of the
<br>
tissue as they see fit - up to the point where it can survive
<br>
independent of life support (a baby can live outside of the womb; a
<br>
mere lump of tissue can not, without a replacement environment such as
<br>
a petri dish).
<br>
<p>The mere potential future existence of an organism does not, in itself,
<br>
grant the potential organism any right to live, especially if its life
<br>
would detract from the quality of life of previously existing
<br>
organisms.  (Crowding out said previously existing organisms definitely
<br>
quailfies, IMO.)  Once it really *does* exist, the situation changes,
<br>
but the mere potential is not enough.  Otherwise, the only ethical
<br>
activity for all human beings would be constant, ceaseless
<br>
reproduction, tempered only by the need to ensure that newborns reach
<br>
puberty.  And perhaps this was the dominant mode of thinking for
<br>
Neanderthals...but we are not cavemen.  (Any argument about extending
<br>
life during one's fertile years can be dashed by the investment in
<br>
life extension for the elderly.  Post-menopausal women are provably
<br>
infertile, and neither are similarly aged men the best fertilizers, so
<br>
why not stop wasting food and other resources on them?  Obviously,
<br>
human lives have some value beyond mere ability to make more lives...)
<br>
<p>Put another way: if the matter which comprises you were to be
<br>
reassembled into a different person, with nature rerolling the dice to
<br>
come up with something completely random, would the average expected
<br>
quality be higher or lower than what you have achieved?  (Note:
<br>
&quot;average expected quality&quot;.  It is *not* valid to compare you to the
<br>
best possible replacement, for exactly the same reason it is not valid
<br>
to compare you to the worst possible.  The chances of the new you being
<br>
the next Messiah, or the destroyer of all humanity, are practically
<br>
equal and therefore cancel each other out.)  If the quality were
<br>
higher, then perhaps this worry might be justified - except that,
<br>
knowing this, you can then reform yourself to be better.  If the
<br>
quality were lower, then your existence (as opposed to other uses for
<br>
your matter) is a net benefit to civilization, and you are justified in
<br>
taking up what resources you do...at least for the moment, though if
<br>
you always strive to improve yourself, this condition may well be
<br>
permanent.
