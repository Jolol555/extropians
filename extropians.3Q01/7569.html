<p>Actually the smallpox virus is based on the vaccinia virus, which is
<br>
where the word &quot;vaccine&quot; comes from.  The medical name for the smallpox
<br>
virus is variola.
<br>
<p>Vaccinia and variola are part of a family of viruses known as Orthopox
<br>
viruses.  These also include monkeypox and cowpox.  There is a related
<br>
family called Avipox viruses which affect birds.  Researchers who work
<br>
with these types of viruses have been the only ones able to get smallpox
<br>
vaccinations in recent years.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5010a1.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5010a1.htm</a> provides a good
<br>
description of the symptoms of smallpox and its progression:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symptoms of smallpox begin 12--14 days (range: 7--17) after exposure,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;starting with a 2--3 day prodrome of high fever, malaise, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prostration with severe headache and backache. This preeruptive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stage is followed by the appearance of a maculopapular rash (i.e.,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eruptive stage) that progresses to papules 1--2 days after the rash
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appears; vesicles appear on the fourth or fifth day; pustules appear
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the seventh day; and scab lesions appear on the fourteenth day
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Figures 1,2) (3). The rash appears first on the oral mucosa, face,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and forearms, then spreads to the trunk and legs (3,4). Lesions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might erupt on the palms and soles as well. Smallpox skin lesions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are deeply embedded in the dermis and feel like firm round objects
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;embedded in the skin. As the skin lesions heal, the scabs separate and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pitted scarring gradually develops (Figure 2) (4). Smallpox patients
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are most infectious during the first week of the rash when the oral
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mucosa lesions ulcerate and release substantial amounts of virus into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the saliva. A patient is no longer infectious after all scabs have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;separated (i.e., 3--4 weeks after the onset of the rash).
<br>
<p>I have been told that emergency workers at hospitals have been given
<br>
lists of symptoms of smallpox and other biological warfare agents so
<br>
that an attack can be recognized as early as possible.  Here is a description
<br>
from the article above of procedures in response to a smallpox attack:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an intentional release of smallpox (variola) virus does occur,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vaccinia vaccine will be recommended for certain groups. Groups for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom vaccination would be indicated include
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persons who were exposed to the initial release of the virus;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persons who had face-to-face, household, or close-proximity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contact (&lt;6.5 feet or 2 meters) (84) with a confirmed or suspected
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smallpox patient at any time from the onset of the patient's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fever until all scabs have separated;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;personnel involved in the direct medical or public health
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluation, care, or transportation of confirmed or suspected
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smallpox patients;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laboratory personnel involved in the collection or processing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of clinical specimens from confirmed or suspected smallpox
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patients; and
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other persons who have an increased likelihood of contact with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;infectious materials from a smallpox patient (e.g., personnel
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responsible for medical waste disposal, linen disposal or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disinfection, and room disinfection in a facility where smallpox
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patients are present).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using recently vaccinated personnel (i.e., &lt;3 years) for patient care
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;activities would be the best practice. However, because recommendations
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for routine smallpox vaccination in the United States were rescinded
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in 1971 and smallpox vaccination is currently recommended only
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for specific groups (see Routine Nonemergency Vaccine Use), having
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recently vaccinated personnel available in the early stages of a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smallpox emergency would be unlikely. Smallpox vaccine can prevent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or decrease the severity of clinical disease, even when administered
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3--4 days after exposure to the smallpox virus (2,4,85). Preferably,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;healthy persons with no contraindications to vaccination, who can
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be vaccinated immediately before patient contact or very soon after
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patient contact (i.e., &lt;3 days), should be selected for patient care
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;activities or activities involving potentially infectious materials.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons who have received a previous vaccination (i.e., childhood
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vaccination or vaccination &gt;3 years before) against smallpox might
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demonstrate a more accelerated immune response after revaccination
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than those receiving a primary vaccination (3). If possible, these
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persons should be revaccinated and assigned to patient care activities
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the early stages of a smallpox outbreak until additional personnel
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be successfully vaccinated.
<br>
<p>So the good news is that emergency administration of the vaccine
<br>
immediately after exposure can reduce symptoms, and that people over 35
<br>
or so who have been previously vaccinated will respond especially well
<br>
to revaccination.
<br>
<p>Bad news aplenty is available from the New Scientist's series on bioterrorism
<br>
at <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/hottopics/bioterrorism/bioterrorism.jsp">http://www.newscientist.com/hottopics/bioterrorism/bioterrorism.jsp</a>.  A
<br>
supposedly reassuring article,
<br>
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/hottopics/bioterrorism/bioterrorism.jsp?id=22492300">http://www.newscientist.com/hottopics/bioterrorism/bioterrorism.jsp?id=22492300</a>,
<br>
begins,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE US already has enough smallpox vaccine to defeat most bioterrorist
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attacks with this virus, according to public health officials. Between
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;six and seven million people could be treated by the amount of vaccine
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is currently in the country's stockpiles.
<br>
<p>but then continues,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meltzer constructed various models based on the number of people
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;infected in the attack, and how many other people each of these
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can infect. His model predicts that between three and nine million
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vaccinations would be enough to contain an initial outbreak affecting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a hundred people, but only if at least a third of those infected were
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put in quarantine as soon as they developed the symptoms.
<br>
<p>So we have plenty of doses - as long as only a hundred people were
<br>
initially exposed!  And even then we need millions of vaccinations to
<br>
handle the outbreak!  This is devastating news because one would suppose
<br>
that the kinds of terrorists we are dealing with today would be able to
<br>
infect far more people than this.
<br>
<p>The latest bit of sunshine on the New Scientists site comes from
<br>
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/hottopics/bioterrorism/bioterrorism.jsp?id=ns99991337">http://www.newscientist.com/hottopics/bioterrorism/bioterrorism.jsp?id=ns99991337</a>:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospect of an anthrax attack was investigated in the 1990s
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the US Office of Technological Assessment. They concluded that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100 kilograms of virulent anthrax effectively dispersed at night
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over Washington DC could cause between one and three million
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deaths. Crop-dusters can carry up to twice that capacity.
<br>
<p>It's very bad news.
