<p>Marihuana is hopeless as an attack drug.
<br>
Acid is worse -- more likely to have mass, freaked-out exodus.
<br>
Heroin is great to calm people down... not too good for getting 'em hyped 
<br>
up for fight.
<br>
Speed is a possible agression drug... as is cocaine... but not reliable.
<br>
<p>The only real war drug I know of is alcohol. It fairly consistently 
<br>
produces aggressive reactions in people.
<br>
<p>(Bear in mind that although I used to sample various drugs decades ago, I 
<br>
have a dislike of all drugs now... and have disdained them all for more 
<br>
than a decade -- with the exception of caffeine -- caffeine is incredibly 
<br>
difficult to give up.)

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
