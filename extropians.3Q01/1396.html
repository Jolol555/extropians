<em>&gt; The Afghanistan government seems to enjoy thumbing its nose at the outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world with announcements of new and novel methods of repression and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-destruction, but now one is left to wonder, what's next?  After all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they've banned women from the workplace, as well as games, paper bags (might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be made from pages of the Koran,) even clear windows facing the street in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private homes (someone walking by could see a woman inside, so they must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; painted black,) men from cutting their beards, and now the internet.  Before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long they'll come up with something new, but they're running out of things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to ban!
</em><br>
<p>What about toilet paper? (assuming they had any before the ban on paper
<br>
bags). I'd imagine that the idea of wiping one's behind with paper that
<br>
might have been recycled from pages of the Koran would be a high
<br>
offense. This gives me an idea, if toilet paper is not outlawed already
<br>
there: purposely make toilet paper with recycled Koran paper, and donate
<br>
it to afghanistan without telling them about its origins until they use
<br>
it all and come back asking for more....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd hazard a guess that, even before this ban, there were fewer than fifty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internet-connected computers in all of Afghanistan, and that most of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belonged to NGOs (foreign Non-Governmental Organizations).  Don't get me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong, zero is worse than forty or fifty, and this news certainly shows that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things, as bad as they are in Afghanistan, can get even worse.
</em><br>
<p>Are NGO's included in the ban, even if they use satellite connections of
<br>
their own?
