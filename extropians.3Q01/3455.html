It just occurred to me that this shoe might fit. Uncomfortably well, if there is such a thing. &lt;see footnote&gt;
<br>
<p>MMB
<br>
<p>PS: If you have any further questions about this or any other of my posts, 
<br>
ask your local acknowledged communications master. And please, tell him 
<br>
to write me privately. Perhaps I can provide a stipend in exchange for guidance. 
<br>
I am only an egg.
<br>
<p>PPS: On second thought, EVERYBODY PILE ON! If you find my posts hard to figure out, 
<br>
please tell me so (offlist). Please keep the header intact to help me keep this 
<br>
feedback properly sorted. Tell me, I can use the info. If possible, some quantitative
<br>
guesses would be appreciated in the following category:
<br>
(1) What fraction of the time do you 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feel like you're wasting your time trying to figure out what I mean?
<br>
(2) What fraction of the time do you 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find my phrasing amusing or special in some worthwhile way?
<br>
(3) What fraction of the active list participants would you guess 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered the way you just did for Q#s 1 and 2?
<br>
<p>Thanks in advance.
<br>
<p>MMB
<br>
<p>FOOTNOTE: BTW, for the Kaspar Hausers out there ( :) ):
<br>
<p>(1) &quot;This shoe might fit&quot; is a figure of speech, signifying that I might be 
<br>
such a person as described in my recent &quot;Incompetence Paper&quot; post, in the 
<br>
context of communication, namely: 
<br>
(a) one who thinks he is a much better communicator than he is;
<br>
&nbsp;or, alternatively, 
<br>
(b) one who thinks he is communicating more than he does; 
<br>
ergo, in effect, &quot;talking to himself&quot;. 
<br>
<p>(2) &quot;Pancritical Rationalism&quot; is described in pages available at the Extropy website. 
<br>
&quot;Panfried...&lt;etc.&gt;&quot; is a transparent, possibly pathetic, attempt to lighten 
<br>
what could otherwise be a terribly depressing-seeming post.
