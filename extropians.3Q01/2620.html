Ten million to twenty-five million (estimates vary) Africans dead on slave

years of slavery (something not experienced by any other
<br>
ethnic/racial group) (rape, murder, torture, and lynching of slaves legal);
<br>
100 more years of de jure segregation (rape, murder, torture and lynching of

black American citizens tolerated); still ongoing de facto segregation after

all those hundreds of years of mean yesterdays; a broken underclass - like

no other underclass in the United States - today.

<p><p>10 to 25 MILLION?! I had to run some numbers on those....
<br>
<p>Being conservative, I took the 10 million figure. Divide that by how many
<br>
were on the boat, I went for possible an extreme number of 1000 slaves on a
<br>
boat (Unless they were driving oil tankers). This would still take 10000
<br>
trips. Did they REALLY have that many boats, or were they shipping people
<br>
from like 5000 B.C. forward? These ships took weeks/months to traverse the
<br>
Atlantic.

<p>P.S. I don't feel sympathetic to any cultures. I never met a culture, only
<br>
individuals. Sorry, I dont think group speak, youll have to rephrase the
<br>
argument without using masses of faceless people you never met and certainly
<br>
cant speak for.
