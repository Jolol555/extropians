Samantha sez to Merriss:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Don't let some phony claiming to speak for the list scare you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;away. I like having you here.  As long as you get something out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of being here please stay.
</em><br>
<p>And so I sez:
<br>
<p>Is there a way we can tell whether Merriss stayed long enough to get all 
<br>
these messages of support? Conversely, Merriss, are you out there?
<br>
<p>Earth to Merriss, Earth to Merriss, are you receiving transmission?
<br>
<p>If you are, then for Ghod's sake stay. Speaking as a nasty atheistic, 
<br>
materialist, &quot;reductionist&quot; (whatever the hell that really means, but I see 
<br>
Margaret Somerville has just published an article making clear that I am 
<br>
one, Ghod bless her neo-Luddite heart, so I'll take it as a compliment), 
<br>
individualist, technolibertarian (and lawyer, which many would consider 
<br>
worst of all), I for one *like* to have a bit of diversity of ideas floating 
<br>
around. Not that Merriss seemed all that out of place amongst us nasty 
<br>
atheistic etceteras anyway.
<br>
<p>If we think she's gone, is there a way she can be followed up? I'd write to 
<br>
her offlist myself but (a) I'm too new here to speak for the list; (b) given 
<br>
the maverick character of most of us, I doubt that *anyone* could speak for 
<br>
the list; and (c) I'm ruthless about deleting e-mails and it'd be a hassle 
<br>
finding her address again. I might try to do so anyway.
<br>
<p>This is the sort of incident that gives the cyberculture and so-called 
<br>
technolibertarians a bad name with mainstream culture, so I hope it can 
<br>
followed up.  :(
