<p>Did you loose someone in the events of Tuesday ??
<br>
Since if you had i could completely understand this kind of irrational rant.
<br>
You can't seriously believe that carpet bombing nations that harbor terrorists
<br>
would really prevent further attacks, more likely inflame all concerned. 
<br>
Leading
<br>
to greater lose of innocent life. And what of the mostly completely innocent
<br>
citizens of said &quot;Bombed to dust&quot; nation, do they deserve to die purely by 
<br>
accident
<br>
of birth.
<br>
<p>Believe me i understand your anger. My own Sister narrowly survived the 
<br>
last WTC
<br>
bombing at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, this time she was safely at the Broadway
<br>
offices. The situation still caused a few frantic hours for me and my two 
<br>
brothers though.
<br>
<p>But you cannot seriously advocate such an indiscriminate policy. Even if 
<br>
you are
<br>
serious am sure you'd re-think as soon as you saw the bodies of innocent women
<br>
and children on CNN. I only wished these kind of scenes had a similar 
<br>
effect on
<br>
terrorists.
<br>
<p>I tend to believe that in all conflicts we show our values partly by acting 
<br>
in a more
<br>
balanced, humane and just way than our adversaries, i don't see your 
<br>
suggestion
<br>
as adding to that particular meme.
