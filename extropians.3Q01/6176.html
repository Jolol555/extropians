<p>Whatever.  After today I've lost track of any relevance you

being right originally somewhat might or might not have.  Sorry
<br>
about that. 
<br>
Vermont is also the only state where the right to carry is
<br>
guaranteed without any red tape.  That it also got out of the
<br>
way on gay marriage isn't surprising considering that it has a
<br>
reputation of standing for what it believes right regardless of
<br>
what the rest of the country does.
