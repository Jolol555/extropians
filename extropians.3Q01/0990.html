<p><em>&gt; As I've said repeatedly in discussions on this topic, it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the short term that concerns me in this discussion
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Right now, many people are getting burned because society's institutions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume some things are secret, and that whoever knows the secret is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person who should have access to an account.  Since privacy is being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eroded, the wrong people have access to too many things, and as a result, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assets are being stolen, credit ratings are being sullied...
</em><br>
<p>I agree that this is an important point, and for some reason I
<br>
don't remember Brin (&quot;The Transparent Society&quot;) discussing it.
<br>
As long as any kind of identity theft is an issue, apparently
<br>
we need to take a very strong stand against compromises of
<br>
&quot;privacy&quot; that would enable theft.  This would include praising
<br>
cryptography (instead of discrediting it), and every other means
<br>
to guard private property.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; When we get to a society in which people understand how much care has to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken to identify the rightful owner of something, or to correctly identify 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone in order to store information about a transaction, and they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand how much reliance it is reasonable to place in those records, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we'll do fine.
</em><br>
<p>And do fine, I'll suggest, with as much openness as possible about
<br>
everything else.  Most of the angst people have about loss of
<br>
privacy doesn't touch on the real issue that you raise.  Instead
<br>
they're afraid that others will snoop on them while they're having
<br>
sex or looking at naughty sites on the internet.  I repeat to them:
<br>
getting used to the possibility that someone is watching you will
<br>
be much easier than is thought, so long as one's personal security
<br>
is enhanced rather than compromised.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Too much celebration of transparency, especially in terms of inevitibility 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and &quot;you'd better get used to it, 'cause you won't be able to stop it&quot; will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fan the flames and make the backlash worse.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe so.  I'd much prefer to celebrate its benefits rather than
<br>
its inevitability.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...I have had inconsistent successes.  Other than people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already &quot;get it&quot; on most subjects, throwing transparency in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people's faces hasn't worked for me.
</em><br>
<p>As you point out, saying its inevitable would be the wrong
<br>
thing, if that's what you were doing.  But if you are running
<br>
into a stone wall just because people feel desperately afraid
<br>
of it, then that's bad news.
