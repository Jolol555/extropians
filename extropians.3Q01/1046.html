<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; has to be stated that not only is what they believe false, but

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that there is something very wrong with how they think.

<em>&gt; [For the record, I do wish to amend my first sentence.  I don't

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can't believe what I am reading.  You have enough knowledge

<em>&gt; &gt; and information to form an opinion.  You do not have enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; knowledge and information to be dead certain that all those who

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;there is something wrong with how they think&quot;.  I hope I

<em>&gt; &gt; misunderstand you here.  This looks like one of the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dogmatic and intolerant opinions I have ever seen anywhere, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from among fundies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Dead certain&quot;?  Obviously, I have to be much less certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is something wrong with how they think, than I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am that what they think is wrong.  Suppose that someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adamantly believes that NASA's people walking on the moon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a hoax.  I'm 99.9% convinced that they're wrong.  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only about 80% convinced that there is something wrong with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *how* they think.  But what else am I supposed to think?
</em><br>
<p>Giving no brain examples that have nothing at all to do with the
<br>
complexity of the topic at hand and with the richness of
<br>
spiritual believes strikes me as a dishonest (intentionally or
<br>
not) tactic.  It belittles by the implication that spirituality
<br>
is equally as odious through and through as morons who think
<br>
walking on the moon was faked.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose that I have a computer program that gives what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think is a 99.9% chance of being a wrong answer.  I simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MUST entertain the hypothesis that there is something wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the program.
</em><br>
<p>Another poor and off-topic analogy that obscures far more than
<br>
it clarifies.  Why not just say you don't want to engage this
<br>
question further?  Because you sure aren't really engaging it
<br>
with this type of response.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There comes a point in disagreeing with people who seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality challenged that one cannot be blamed for inquiring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as to why they are so bad at understanding the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is precisely because I am not reality challenged that I must
<br>
consider spirituality and in some ways embrace it.  Reality,
<br>
including those aspects most consider spiritual, has butted
<br>
heads with me a few times to many to do otherwise.   Do you take
<br>
into account that I just might be just as deeply honest and have
<br>
every bit as much integrity as you do despite the fact I see
<br>
some things differently than you?
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Most dogmatic and intolerant opinions&quot; you've ever seen?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that you are exaggerating.
</em><br>
<p><p>If I am mistaken you have given me no grounds for seeing that I
<br>
am here.  If anything you seem to be clinging harder to the
<br>
position that those who affirm some parts of religion or
<br>
spirituality are damaged in their thinking processes.  You also
<br>
seem to have some difficulty seeing (or admitting anyway) that
<br>
this position is a tad extreme.
