This has a good idea in it: World Transhuman Day. It's a nice, easy meme to
<br>
propagate -- like the bumper stickers. Every other concept in the world has
<br>
a day/month/week devoted to it. It's a sufficiently common governmental
<br>
practice that people are familiar with the idea that if something has a
<br>
named day devoted to it, there is some backing organization wanting you to
<br>
think about something for your own or societal good.
<br>
<p>[Although I think I'm more concerned than many around here about getting the
<br>
&quot;common people&quot; involved in and backing life extension, technology,
<br>
futurism, etc].
<br>
<p>World Transhuman Day: think to the future!
<br>
<p>Any takers?

Subject: Extrinsic Extropians?
<br>
<p><p><p>Knowing full well there has to be a marketable &quot;hook,&quot; I've been thinking
<br>
about submitting an idea for an article, taking, for instance, the
<br>
&quot;sentimental,&quot; &quot;old-fashioned,&quot; &quot;traditional,&quot; &quot;romantic,&quot; &quot;miraculous&quot; and
<br>
&quot;magical time of year&quot; holiday season which usually start popping to
<br>
gigantic proportions like corn (before Halloween, the last time I looked),
<br>
except maybe enticing the reading public with a look towards a more
<br>
inclusive, rational, and even more-&quot;gifted&quot; (better living through
<br>
technology) holiday season possible in the future.  But maybe that's asking
<br>
too much (i.e., asking people to give up their comfortable visions of sugar
<br>
plums and all the rest).
<br>
<p>Personally, I don't celebrate anything - well, not anything, exactly, but
<br>
more on the level of something personal, like my grandson's recent first
<br>
birthday.  But if there were truly an &quot;ideal&quot; holiday for humans in the
<br>
future, how would it look ...?  (Transhumans and posthumans could probably
<br>
program in their own jollies - no need for extrinsic merriment, ho ho ho.)
<br>
<p>If you have any ideas - a blurb or two - and would be inspired to share with
<br>
me offlist (or with the rest of the extropes onlist), I would be very
<br>
grateful.  And please let me know if I may quote you, if this article idea
<br>
ever comes to fruition (in which case I will let you know).
