<p>Nope.
<br>
<p>The death toll in this incident is only (only!) on the same order
<br>
as a small terrorist A-bomb attack on New York.
<br>
<p>For the *worst* thing, contemplate a *large* nuclear attack, or
<br>
extensive use of CB weapons, or ...
<br>
<p>This is not at the higher end of the sort of damage that countries
<br>
receive in time of war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am much more afraid of the implicite implications.

<br>
Yep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It reminds me at the Reichstag fire in Germany,1933.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Altough it was probably the deed of a lonely terrorist, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gave Hitler the public support against his political opponents.
</em><br>
<p>The Reichstag fire was orchestrated by the Nazis, IIRC. 
<br>
<p>This event ... no. I thought &quot;Reichstag fire&quot; when I First
<br>
heard about it, but this is too big to be a domestic conspiracy
<br>
aimed at justifying a clampdown. (Conspirators who try to take
<br>
over a country tend to want to keep it intact in the process.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Bush said: &quot;The freedom is attacked.&quot; I fear: we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defend our freedom so strong that we won't have any anymore.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am afraid that the terrorists will succeed in attacking it,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Remember: &quot;security is inversely proportional to convenience&quot; is an
<br>
old lesson in computing. Unfortunately security is also inimical 
<br>
to civil liberties, in the real world.
<br>
<p>Looking at the demographics, even when you take this event into account,
<br>
the US has had a much lower average terrorist death toll over the past
<br>
thirty years than the UK. (Northern Ireland: 3000 dead in 30 years,
<br>
population 58 million for the whole UK. NY/DC: 10,000 dead, 260 million
<br>
people.) But I suspect you're going to get thirty years' worth of
<br>
intrusive security measures in about one week flat, now ...
