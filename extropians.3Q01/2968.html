<em>&gt; Oh great.  Here we have an issue that taxes the emotional

</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough, someone wants to ban it.  Do you not wonder then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that people want to ban cloning and everything else that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes them feel uncomfortable?
</em><br>
<p>We don't have list rules against uncomfortable subjects.  We do have list
<br>
rules against ad hominem.  Stating that blacks cannot achieve as well as
<br>
whites is ad hominem.  It attacks the person as invalid rather than
<br>
discussing any person's actions, topics, theories, actions, statements, etc.
<br>
It was persuasive rather than objective.
<br>
<p>On any topic, this kind of attack or argument methodology is against the
<br>
list rules.  If someone had attacked a particular list member by claiming
<br>
their race was inferior instead of attacking their specific actions,
<br>
statements or claims, this would violate the list rules.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hey, thanks Harvey!  But I'm sure that if you reflect a while,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'll come to believe that it really would be good to examine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the evidence, especially if we can do so in an objective fashion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The claim is not pathetic.
</em><br>
<p>I did examine the evidence.  I posted a specific analysis of the post
<br>
against the definition of racism.  I listed the specific examples where the
<br>
author implied that all whites were one way while all blacks were another
<br>
way.  I listed the specific examples where the author stated that whites
<br>
often go above a certain level of achievement whereas no blacks could ever
<br>
attain this same level.  My analysis was objective, precise and complete.  I
<br>
did not resort to ad hominem or emotion persuasiveness in my analysis.  The
<br>
claim that the article was rational or scientific is pathetic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now I notice, for the first time that I can recall, statements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as these being made without any quoting of the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sources.  This is very peculiar.  I think the explanation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the original source (Fred Reed's essay) is heavy on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innuendo and implication, and doesn't so easily yield up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quotable examples.  But this just makes discussing it only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more difficult, not impossible.  If we are to find the truth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then such effort must be undertaken.
</em><br>
<p>*Sigh*  I can't believe that my examples were not clear enough or that you
<br>
can't find the relevant passages for yourself.  However, for the sake of
<br>
completeness of the record, let me clearly quote exact passages from the
<br>
article:
<br>
<em>&gt; owe me for three bicycles. Maybe it's a small thing, but I'm tired of
</em><br>
losing bicycles.
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;feemelkeebome&quot; is stretching it. The errors were of this sort.[...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without thinking, I asked, &quot;What color is your teacher?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (If I had thought carefully, I would have asked, &quot;What color is your
</em><br>
teacher?&quot;)
<br>
<em>&gt; I can yell at an ignorant white teacher, but not at a black one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To expect blacks to meet standards is racist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People in, say, Switzerland can walk their streets after dark. We can't.
</em><br>
Why?
<br>
<em>&gt; - they never caught the killers, but - what you reckon, Johnny? Do you
</em><br>
figure it was white Presbyterian women from the old-ladies' home?
<br>
<em>&gt; positron-emission scanners, high-bypass turbofans, radar with Doppler
</em><br>
beam-sharpening. Yet basically a culture is a body of knowledge, like
<br>
Microsoft Word. (All right, throw in values. But I don't want to make this
<br>
too difficult.) White guys invented these things at considerable cost.
<br>
<em>&gt; Air-conditioning. Roads. Writing. The wheel. Complicated stuff like that.
</em><br>
Medicine. Tractors. Shoes. Houses.
<br>
<em>&gt; I'd love to see blacks study, earn degrees on their merits, prosper.
</em><br>
<p>These statements make these racist assumptions (in order of the above
<br>
quotes):
<br>
- unseen bicycle thieves are assumed to be black
<br>
- poor teachers are assumed to probably be black
<br>
- countries without crime problems are assumed to be so because of a lack of
<br>
blacks
<br>
- unsolved murders are assumed to be committed by blacks
<br>
- all technology inventions are assumed to be made by whites and not blacks
<br>
- all western civilization are assumed to be due to whites and not blacks
<br>
- all value in Microsoft Word is assumed to be due to Microsoft's white
<br>
employees and none of their black employees
<br>
- basic tools such as roads, writing, the wheel, shoes, houses are assumed
<br>
to have been invented by whites but not blacks
<br>
- the wheel is assumed to have been invented by a white and not a black
<br>
- blacks are assumed to be incapable of study
<br>
- degrees earned by blacks are assumed to be given without merit
<br>
- blacks are assumed to be unable to prosper
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Well I grant you the post didn't contain anything on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; order of: &quot;All niggers are shiftless, lazy, criminals who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have made no worthwhile contribution to society&quot;
</em><br>
<p>But it did say this!  A point-by-point analysis of your statement above
<br>
shows that the article did exactly claim everything you said.  It called
<br>
them blacks for &quot;niggers&quot;.  It called them robbers and murderers for
<br>
&quot;shiftless&quot;.  It blamed them for welfare for &quot;lazy&quot;.  It blamed crime and
<br>
large police departments on them for &quot;criminals&quot;.  It claimed that all
<br>
civilization and technology was invented by whites without any contributions
<br>
from blacks for &quot;no worthwhile contribution to society&quot;.  The article says
<br>
exactly what you claim would be racist.
