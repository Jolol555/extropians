<em>&gt; I'm still waiting on someone to say what the racists statements, tones, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attitudes have been said here. I haven't heard anyone make any racists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements. I haven't heard anyone say that any particular race was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherently superior. I've heard bigoted ones, and I've heard discriminatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones. I know this may seem like nitpicking definitions, but its important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that words keep their meanings else more confusion erupts. If your going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use the word racist, please have the common courtesy to know what it means,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how it differs from bigoted and discriminatory.
</em><br>
<p>Very astute observation, Jerry. Thank you for stating it so eloquently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; P.S. Another pet peeve of mine is there is no such word as &quot;Disrepecting&quot;!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Webster would be rolling over in his grave :)
</em><br>
<p>Trouble is, what is disrespecting to one person is &quot;Vicious Racism&quot; to another
<br>
because no one bothers to stick to solid definitions. Your pet peeve is imo
<br>
well justified and quite valid.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:

<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, and ego.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)

<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
