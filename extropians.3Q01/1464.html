<em>&gt; There are some people who just don't care much about their health - they smoke, drive drunk, blow their cortical vessels with cocaine, and then come to depend on public largesse for treatment and other support, without ever paying a dime into the pool of insurance money. I would have no compunction about letting them rely on private charity for their needs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
But perhaps they die quicker thus not putting as much a burden on 'the system'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But then, there are other people, those who you are probably thinking about - the nice, hard-working, regular folks, who sincerely want to pay but just happen to make too little money for full insurance, after paying for food, rent, utilities, kids' college fund. I am willing to help them, to some extent, and to support the use of governmental oppression to force other citizens to help, too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
But they have enough money for three tv's, full cable, week-long vacations to Disney World - perhaps they linger on and on - and for what?
<br>
<p>Is it still worth it?
