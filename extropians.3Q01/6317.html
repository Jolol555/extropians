</em><br>
<p>Well, there have been a few terrorist deeds. But most of them have been
<br>
aimed at other nations, such as the murder of the Yugoslaw ambassador
<br>
or the destruction of the German embassy in the 70's. Of course, the
<br>
assassination of prime minister Olof Palme might have been a serious
<br>
terrorist deed. 
<br>
<p>There is another reason for such attacks on the US, and that is
<br>
antiamericanism. It might appear absurd to many on this list, but there
<br>
are plenty of people who are deeply suspicious and prejudiced against
<br>
the US worldwide - including highly educated intellectuals. Just think
<br>
about how attacks on McDonald's in Europe has been framed not as attacks
<br>
on a local franchise, but attempts to stop American cultural
<br>
imperialism. Part of this is remaining cold war rhethoric that has
<br>
spread far beyond the left, a bit like sticky tar that sticks to
<br>
whatever is touching it and hence spreads everywhere. Part of it is of
<br>
course envy. Another part is the western sympathy for David versus
<br>
Goliath - the underdog is always the hero, the giant is never the hero:
<br>
since the US is a giant, it can't be good. All these things combine to
<br>
make prejudices against americans acceptable like no other prejudices
<br>
and biases the media - which reinforces the antiamericanism. 
<br>
<p>In many ways the fact that the US has become very rich and powerful by
<br>
being a beacon of freedom is the reason so many feel it acceptable to
<br>
attack it. That US foreign policy also gives them ample reason is simply
<br>
the igniting spark that ignites the fuel that is already there. 
<br>
<p>While an isolationist policy might earn the US a few brownie points in
<br>
many eyes, it wouldn't be enough. Especially if you factor in people who
<br>
have long memories and still want a revenge for what happened to their
<br>
forefathers.
