</em><br>
<p>That's at <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.02/warwick.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.02/warwick.html</a>.
<br>
<p>Coincidentally I received the August issue of Wired today and it describes
<br>
research next to which Warwick's little arm chip is little more than a
<br>
sideshow stunt.  The article, by wheelchair-bound John Hockenberry, tells
<br>
about work to expand the capabilities of the disabled via mind-machine
<br>
interface:
<br>
<p>&quot;When you meet Johnny Ray, it's a challenge to see the former drywall
<br>
contractor and amateur musician trapped inside his body, but he's there.
<br>
Ray, a 63-year-old from Carrollton, Georgia, suffered a brain-stem stroke
<br>
in 1997, which produced what doctors call &quot;locked-in syndrome&quot;: He has
<br>
virtually no moving parts.  Cognitively he's intact, but he can't make
<br>
a motion to deliver that message or any other to the world.&quot;
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>&quot;[Dr. Roy] Bakay... wouldn't describe anything he does as show business,
<br>
but to me the results of his work sound like a real-world version of
<br>
the nifty plug Neo/Keanu sported in The Matrix.
<br>
<p>&quot;'We simply make a hole in the skull right above the ear, near the back
<br>
end of the motor cortex, secure our electrodes and other hardware to
<br>
the bone so they don't migrate, and wait for a signal,' Bakay says.
<br>
The implant is an intriguing hybrid of electronics and biology - it
<br>
physically melds with brain tissue.
<br>
<p>&quot;'We use a small piece of glass shaped like two narrow cones into which
<br>
a gold electrical contact has been glued,' Bakay says.  'The space in
<br>
the cones is filled with a special tissue culture, and the whole thing
<br>
is placed inside the motor cortex.'  The tissue culture is designed to
<br>
'attract' brain cells to grow toward the contact.  When brain cells meet
<br>
gold, the electrical activity of individual cells is detectable across
<br>
the electrode.  Gold wires carry signals back out of the skull, where they
<br>
are amplified.  This produces a far more sensitive and usable signal than
<br>
you get from surface technology like the taped-on electrodes used in EEGs.
<br>
<p>&quot;To get a broad sense of what the patient's brain is doing, neurologists
<br>
perform magnetic resonance imaging and compare changes in the motor
<br>
cortext with voltages monitored through the electrodes.  Then the doctors
<br>
get really clever.  The patient is encouraged to think simple thoughts
<br>
that correspond to distinct conditions and movements, like hot/cold or
<br>
up/down.  Gradually, the doctors extract and codify electrical patterns
<br>
that change as a patient's thoughts change.  If a patient can reproduce
<br>
and trigger the signal using the same thought patterns, that signal can
<br>
be identified and used to control, say, a cursor on a computer screen.
<br>
The technique is very crude, but what Bakay and his colleagues have
<br>
demonstrated is a truly alternative brain-body interface pattern.&quot;
<br>
<p>At first Ray has to imagine arm motions to trigger the cursor, but over
<br>
time his brain adapts:
<br>
<p>&quot;As the brain cells in and around Ray's implant did what he asked
<br>
them to do, the imagined sensation of moving his body parts gradually
<br>
disappeared altogether.  One day when his skill at moving the cursor
<br>
seemed particularly adept, the doctors asked Ray what he was feeling.
<br>
Slowly, he typed, 'nothing.'
<br>
<p>&quot;Ray was interacting directly with the cursor similar to how he might once
<br>
have interacted with his hand.  'People don't think &quot;move hand&quot; to move
<br>
their hands unless they are small children just learning,' Bakay explains.
<br>
'Eventually the brain just eliminates these intermediate steps until the
<br>
hand feels like a part of the brain.'  The description reminds me of how
<br>
I've heard Isaac Stern describe his violin as an extension of his body.
<br>
I think of my wheelchair the same way.
<br>
<p>&quot;The fact that Ray's cursor is indistinguishable from almost any other
<br>
prosthesis raises an important philosophical question: Because of the
<br>
implant, is a Dell Pentium cursor now more a part of Johnny Ray than
<br>
one of his own paralyzed arms?&quot;
<br>
<p>These people are the real cyborgs, with actual brain implants interfacing
<br>
to their nervous system, allowing them to control the world around them
<br>
in new ways.
<br>
