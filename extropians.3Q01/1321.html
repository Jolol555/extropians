Robin has posed a series of comments/questions:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...might be worth following the argument through to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what velocity it suggests.
</em><br>
<p>Hal did a rough cut on that (Thanks Hal).  The 6 small
<br>
objects would appear to be going ~40x faster than the
<br>
larger object.  The orbital speeds in our solar system
<br>
range from 4.7 km/sec for pluto to 47 km/sec for Mercury.
<br>
<p>While 10x range vs. 40x range isn't too much of a difference
<br>
I can't think of any really good XBrain bound to orbiting
<br>
star scenarios that would make much sense.  So as the
<br>
article suggests these would have to be &quot;free-floating&quot;
<br>
objects.  (Or else the article is mis-interpreting one
<br>
set of observations.)
<br>
<p>Its useful to keep in mind that within globular clusters the
<br>
available &quot;starlight&quot; is much greater, so Jupiter Brains
<br>
don't have to orbit stars, they can use the light energy
<br>
from the cluster as a whole.
<br>
<p>One other reason has occured to me for fast transit times.
<br>
If JBrains are star-lifting by direct encounter, e.g.
<br>
fast transit through the star's upper atmosphere sucking
<br>
up material as you go, then I suspect you are going to
<br>
want those orbits to be made at fairly high velocity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So does this imply a correlation between object mass &amp; attachment?
</em><br>
<p>Civilizations derived from low-mass stars or constructed from
<br>
nearby brown dwarfs probably only have enough material for JBrains.
<br>
They could migrate to the globular clusters because of the
<br>
greater material resources there.
<br>
<p>Civilizations derived from larger-mass stars probably construct
<br>
MBrains and have to do a lot of star-lifting of said star
<br>
to lengthen its lifespan.  They are less likely to migrate
<br>
due to the larger mass they have to cart around.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OK, might be worth estimating this velocity (drift velocity) too.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Natural&quot; star velocities are going to vary with distance from
<br>
the galactic center.  Stars very near the center are orbiting
<br>
very fast, stars out beyond the sun are moving more slowly.
<br>
The sun is orbiting the galaxy at 220 km/sec.  There is a
<br>
velocity dispersion of +/-40 km/sec in various regions (older
<br>
stars have had more close encounters and are going faster).
<br>
So that is what a civilization would start with.  How fast you
<br>
can crank up the speed depends how long you have been accelerating,
<br>
how much matter &amp; energy you were willing to sacrifice and what
<br>
you had nearby for gravity assists.
<br>
<p>Spike is better at these types of calculations that I am, perhaps
<br>
he could set some constraints on what various strategies and
<br>
costs associated with accelerating a 0.25 M_J (5x10^26 kg) object
<br>
from say 15 km/sec around a star traveling at 300 km/sec (closer
<br>
to M22) up to say 600 (15*40) km/sec.  I'm reasonably sure that it
<br>
depends on how much energy you can pump out on really close flybys of
<br>
massive objects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I realize that it would be more work to make these estimates,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but this does seem the key datum that you have to predict soon.
</em><br>
<p>Given the fact that stellar velocities span at least an order
<br>
of magnitude (so J/MBrains could potentially start with
<br>
a range of velocities almost as large), it isn't clear how much
<br>
value such a velocity prediction would have.  A much better
<br>
&quot;predictor&quot; (IMO) is setting constraints on the rate at which stars
<br>
&quot;go dark&quot; (that I am working on).  I would predict that
<br>
JBrains should have significantly higher interstellar velocities
<br>
than MBrains, but how much higher would require a complete
<br>
a galactic model of stellar evolution, rates of development
<br>
of ATC, and some simulations of the various gravity assist
<br>
acceleration strategies and an economic analysis of what
<br>
the civilization can afford to sacrifice if it can recover
<br>
some or all of it when it arrives at the destination.  I think
<br>
thats a PhD thesis or two of work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As you know I'd estimate a pretty low chance that these things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are MB/JB, but I am interested in thinking about how to check this.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, I know you are in Eugene's camp (or perhaps he is in yours),
<br>
but thats ok, the questioning and provoking of study in the
<br>
nooks and crannies of these ideas is what makes them interesting.
<br>
Even if it isn't about the way the Galaxy &quot;is&quot;, it is about the
<br>
way the galaxy might someday be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How solid is the spectra prediction, btw?
</em><br>
<p>I'm pretty confident in that.  I forgot to mention it in
<br>
my OSETI III presentation and Charles Townes suggested it
<br>
during the Q&amp;A period.  The problem is you need big telescopes
<br>
so odd ratios of those gases might give a hint of what lay beneath.
<br>
to get good spectra.  For comparison, we can get spectra from brown
<br>
dwarfs out to a few hundred light years at this point.  So we
<br>
have a way to go before we can get spectra for JBrains at ~7000+ l.y.
<br>
<p>Any ATC evolving around a G or F class stars, with a metallicity
<br>
after the first few billion years of galactic history &quot;should&quot;
<br>
have enough metal available to enshroud the star.  Not doing
<br>
so would seem to be a waste.  If its an MBrain architecture
<br>
the spectral argument is good.  If its a JBrain architecture
<br>
(particularly if they decide to store the &quot;fuel&quot; as an &quot;atmosphere&quot;)
<br>
then the spectral argument may work less well.  I'd suspect
<br>
though that that engineers whould choose to save the H
<br>
and throw away the He and use the carbon in any methane,
<br>
so its not entirely useless.
