</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because companies find it more cost effective to reuse and recycle.i
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The development of these technologies is predictable so long as competition

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Another driver is that the public wants a cleaner environment for lots

<em>&gt; &gt; of reasons, and finds ways to encourage their neighbors to not mess up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the neighborhood.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the &quot;art of the long view&quot; -- it only comes when people collectively

</em><br>
<em>&gt; So long as you &quot;know&quot; you are going to be dead in 100 years, it is in one's

<p>THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!!!

<p>Robert! I love it when men talk smart! It's so damn sexy!!!
<br>
<p>Any basic for an economic system must include the inherent cost of
<br>
the short and long term effects of that economy. Those effects must
<br>
include resouce utilization, sustainability, ecological and environmental
<br>
cost, and the cost benefit of that economic venture to the culture in
<br>
which it operates. An equitable system must be established that does
<br>
not allow one person to benefit at the harm or death of thousands or
<br>
millions of others. Our current system lives inside completely fallicious
<br>
concepts. Resources are not endless (at least as long as we live on this
<br>
planet, and even shortly after we leave the planet, resoures may indeed
<br>
become limiting factor for growth.) The world cannot endure unlimited
<br>
damage, or pollution. The world cannot sustain unlimited human
<br>
populations. Yet, the basis of our economics assume these very things.
<br>
As long as it is less expensive to dump waste illegaly, then it is to do the
<br>
right thing, there will always be somebody, who feels that the money to
<br>
be spent on waste handling could be doing something better... to the
<br>
detrement of those poor bastards downstream... and if caught, oh well
<br>
the hand slap fine for getting caught 1 in 500 times makes this a boom
<br>
business in some states.
<br>
<p>A sane economic system includes the cost of cleaning it's messes and
<br>
repairing the damage done (if any) as a function of doing business. It
<br>
makes ecological disasters so expensive at the onset, that they are
<br>
never financially feasible on planet (as it should be...) It makes the cost
<br>
of doing business balance with the responsibility of sustaining human
<br>
life at a workable level of quality of life. It also supports a world that has
<br>
room for other species, habitats, and ecological diversity... not because
<br>
there is any inherent value in one deer, but because we are biotic, and
<br>
as long as we are, we had better manage to keep the biosphere in
<br>
sufficient working order to sustain us through transition to the our next
<br>
level of evolution... it would also do us well to remember the power of
<br>
exponential growth... just as our technology is taking off, so is our
<br>
ability to turn the world into a toxic toilet. I would highly recommend
<br>
that we make sure the curve towards our acension as higher forms
<br>
of intelligence, isn't terminated by the curve delineating the exponential
<br>
growth of the impact of our reptile thinking stupidity.
