Jerry Mitchell writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, the closest we come to a &quot;golden age of libertarianism&quot; is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; period of time here in the IS from the country's founding to about 1900.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the country was closer to maximally free (except for women and
<br>
slaves) just prior to 1860.  See the book &quot;Emancipating Slaves, Enslaving
<br>
Free Men&quot; by Jeffrey Hummel.  He documents how the U.S. was actually getting
<br>
*more* free following 1789 the closer one gets to 1850 or so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A nation with nothing but trees, rivers, and rocks was turned into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wealthiest nation of all time!  Why didn't this happen elsewhere?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is it that we had more then anyone else on the planet.  I put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forth freedom.
</em><br>
<p>Freedom is definitely an important factor.  But it was also very
<br>
beneficial to have a mostly empty continent to expand into, so that
<br>
old institutions, vested interests, and bad traditions and memes
<br>
didn't need to be overcome.  Suppose that Catharine the Great's
<br>
Russia at the same time had been equally enamored of freedom.  They
<br>
too had a somewhat empty continent; but vast, vast areas of Russia
<br>
were already occupied by an extremely poor and backward peasantry.
<br>
Moreover, the Orthodox Church was a retarding power to be reckoned
<br>
with.  Russia, because of these very handicaps, would *not* have
<br>
boomed the way that 18th and 19th century America did.
<br>
<p>Olga writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the period of time you mention women weren't free even to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vote - sheesh.  (And, sorry, but the slave issue has to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brought up -- remember, the USA was supposed to be a democracy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that makes the America's involvement with slavery that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more hyprocritical and shameful).
</em><br>
<p>No one is arguing that, Olga.  You had asked when the U.S. had
<br>
been most libertarian *in terms of the economic benefits* that
<br>
accrued to large numbers of people and facilitated enormous
<br>
economic growth.  Of course it is shameful and (for any patriots)
<br>
quite embarrassing.  But as Jerry said, in the 19th century 
<br>
America was still among the most free countries in the world.
<br>
Only England, of any major nation, if I recall correctly, 
<br>
abolished slavery earlier.  Likewise, can you tell me what
<br>
industrialized countries allowed women to vote earlier than
<br>
the U.S. did?  (Yes, this is a literal question; I'm not
<br>
trying to make any point.)
