<em>&gt; The founding fathers also did not think enough ahead to institute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms that would act to limit the growth of government authority,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like mandating sunset clauses, term limits, as well as preventing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; congressmen from being appointed to the Supreme Court, and preventing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; families of civil servants from establishing bureaucratic dynasties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This lack of foresight was inherent in the fact that the founders were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally of agrarian extraction, with little experience in the courts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and bureaucracies of the european governments. They lacked the vision to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forsee that the US would ever rival the european powers in governmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inertia.
</em><br>
<p>Nonsense. Who was it with the revolution every couple of hundred years
<br>
quote? The founding fathers of the US had enough sense to know that anything
<br>
they did was futile in the long run. At least they kept the initial
<br>
consitution pretty simple.
<br>
<p>If you can come up with a set of bureaucratic rules that will prevent bloat
<br>
of bureaucracy on a timescale of centuries (i.e. will alter the very essence
<br>
of human societal nature), I'd like to see them. Ever played Nomic? It's a
<br>
very enlightening game that aptly demonstrates politics on fast forward.
