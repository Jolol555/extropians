<em>&gt; The other day I mentioned my devotion to Aaron Sorkin's astonishingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective TV drama THE WEST WING. We in Oz are behind, as usual, so the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; season finale only just viewed here last night. I have to tell you, it made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my hair stand on end to see the good-guy Catholic Prez of the United States
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standing in the nave of a mighty cathedral denouncing god as a feckless son
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a bitch. Granted, there was a slightly sentimental implied redemptive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retraction in the closing moments (God doesn't *cause* fatal car crashes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so it's all right, there, there), but this ferocious and entirely justified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blasphemy on a major US TV series did my heart good, I have to tell you.
</em><br>
<p>I had taped this last week but only got around to watching it tonight
<br>
as well.  It was incredible to see this display of anger directed at God,
<br>
after the upsurge in public declarations of religious sentiment these
<br>
past couple of weeks.  Of course the episode was filmed many months ago.
<br>
<p>Apparently the premiere episode of The West Wing, scheduled for October
<br>
3, will be pushed back a week and a special episode will be broadcast on
<br>
the 3rd relating to the terrorist attacks.  I'm not sure how they will
<br>
do this, since obviously the fictional presidency in the show is not
<br>
intended to mirror the real world at all closely.  However Sorkin feels
<br>
that he can say something about the attacks in the context of the show.
