<p>
I share with you here a letter I got from a friend, a Scottish fellow
<br>
in his early thirties, with many years experience in the trenches of
<br>
international aid, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.  I had asked him
<br>
for his candid opinion of 9.11 and its aftermath.  I'm posting what he
<br>
wrote back on 9.15.  I don't agree with everything he says, but I think
<br>
the letter is good enough to be worth reading and considering.
<br>
<p>Best to all,
<br>
<p>Bill 
<br>
<p><p>Dear Bill,
<br>
<p>I hope you don't mind me cc'ing this reply; my brain works slowly and
<br>
I take a while to ponder these things. However, here is my take from
<br>
this side of the pond borrowing freely from the broadsheets of the week.
<br>
<p>There is no doubt that Britain and Europe are 110% feeling for America
<br>
and its people and still numb from the appalling scale of the atrocities.
<br>
&nbsp;In small ways and big, the week's events have been a focal point for
<br>
everyone to try and send their own message of support and defiance.
<br>
<p>Yesterday at 11 (UK time), Britain stopped for 3 minutes silence -  something
<br>
only really done to honour the dead of the 1st world war here, and even
<br>
then, only for 2 minutes, not 3. Up in this remote island, so distant
<br>
from the madness of the world, Mary and I and some friends, stood out
<br>
on the cottage steps in silence, and looking at the mountains sent our
<br>
own silent support for you all.
<br>
<p>It maybe a small gesture, but the Formula 1 championship in Monza this
<br>
weekend is trying to race the cars with absolutely no sponsorship; as
<br>
a 
<br>
sign of support for American business and people - an unheard of gesture
<br>
from a sport that is powerful and very rich. Elsewhere people are lighting
<br>
candles at pre-ordained times.....The Royal family and all politicians
<br>
held a special service of remembrance yesterday (To give you an idea
<br>
of the scale of shock and support, even when Lady Di died, nothing happened
<br>
on such a scale so fast).
<br>
<p>You mentioned the emotion of Tony Blair in his initial speech and thereafter.
<br>
It is not contrived. He speaks on behalf of Britain, with a lump in his
<br>
throat for the people, and a slight shiver about the possible ramifications.
<br>
<p>And it is this fear, that is becoming the focus of people's thoughts
<br>
(and most of my observations and newspaper articles below) here.
<br>
<p>George W is not regarded highly at all. The fear, is that a man with
<br>
such miniscule worldy experience (to put it mildly), will precipitate
<br>
something even worse.
<br>
<p>There is no suggestion that such horrific crimes could ever go unpunished,
<br>
but concern that the punishment will be along the lines of 'Hoo'ah, lets
<br>
kick some ass'; To declare &quot;war&quot; on terrorism will only encourage recruits
<br>
for terrorism - it makes it almost legal.  George W is seen as too ready
<br>
to take the law into his own hands, to do his bit for the people, but
<br>
unwittingly start WW3.
<br>
<p>America is not necessarily seen worldwide as a beacon of liberty but
<br>
as a beacon of greed and a military bully that undermines other cultures.
<br>
In the long term an adjustment of foreign policy (like blind support
<br>
of Israel, regardless of the hypocritical actions it carries out against
<br>
the Palestinians) to try and diffuse this hatred would be a good long
<br>
term investment. (It has even been mentioned that maybe now America will
<br>
understand British anger at continued american support for the 
<br>
IRA....more people have been killed by the IRA - proportionate to population
<br>
-than the Manhattan and Pentagon atrocities, but Britain did not declare
<br>
war on Ireland, the IRA or even America for often harbouring the terrorists).
<br>
&nbsp;If it is not this view of the 'Imperialist west', then what has the
<br>
West and America in particular done to incur such hatred?
<br>
<p>But time and time again in articles and letters, is the repeated need
<br>
to observe the international rule of law and use it to deliver a &quot;proportionate,
<br>
discriminate, but lethal blow to those held 
<br>
responsible&quot;. Is it fair that Afghans or Iraqis feel the need to prepare
<br>
their country for war, or flee their country en masse? Is an eye for
<br>
an eye the correct response?
<br>
<p>You may remember I have some personal experience of terrorism first hand.
<br>
&nbsp;Personally, on a one to one basis, I would have been happy to be locked
<br>
in a room with the person responsible, and either understand him and/or
<br>
beat him to a pulp. But I would have run a mile, rather than agree that
<br>
the correct response would have been anything other than a mighty blow
<br>
against his (proven) terrorist organisation and its leader.
<br>
<p>Tuesday's acts were not an act of war but criminal acts on a horrifying
<br>
scale. A 'warlike' response is not justified. To Joe Bloggs here, $20
<br>
billion is a huge amount to start a campaign, unless starting a 'war'
<br>
footing. But wars involve campaigns to gain control of territories and
<br>
populations with clearly identifiable protaganists....two wrongs do not
<br>
make a right.
<br>
<p>&quot;Nobody doubts America's power to visit unimaginable violence on others.
<br>
But to what end? The people are rightly angry, but surely not stupid.
<br>
They can distinguish determination from vengeance, caution from appeasement,
<br>
acts of will from acts of lunacy&quot;. Heart must not rule head in an issue
<br>
that could unleash carnage on a scale that would drive America back behind
<br>
barriers and borders for a generation or more.
<br>
<p>The statesman's job is not to rant but to think - the reason Brits are
<br>
a little uneasy with the US leadership. Reasoned action is one thing,
<br>
but weakness is the thing that jerks the knee and drops The Bomb. After
<br>
all, suicidal madmen and lunatics are not 'deterred'. A great assault
<br>
on any Muslim state from the air will be an answer to a prayer for Bin
<br>
Laden and his like. The Manhattan slaughter would almost be legitimised
<br>
in some people's eyes. Furthermore, the British empire 'met its Waterloo'
<br>
in Afghanistan, as did the Russians....are the Americans about to follow?
<br>
<p>Enough political observation my friend(s). This is the mood over here.
<br>
&nbsp;A little nervous, especially as politically and militarily we stand
<br>
side by side with you guys; especially difficult as in effect we are
<br>
bystanders to the decisions the US leadership will take, but thereafter
<br>
will be  involved.
<br>
<p>The Britons have been attacked by (and have attacked) pretty well every
<br>
historical maurauder that lived. But we are still here. We thank everything
<br>
we believe in that we have our life and health today, that we have not
<br>
been direct witness to the appalling and needless destruction of this
<br>
week and continue to hold you in our thoughts. As many people have said,
<br>
if this is the world we live in, may God have mercy on us. It cannot
<br>
and must not continue, but likewise, the west cannot declare war on anyone
<br>
other than those directly and proven responsible. May this week be something
<br>
never to be seen again in our lifetime. May the response when it comes,
<br>
be something applauded worldwide as the right thing to do, not the trigger
<br>
to the destruction of the world that we know.
<br>
<p>Anyway my friend, here ends the lesson according to The Times, Simon
<br>
Jenkins, Rich Postins and I. I hope it has nothing too surprising in
<br>
it, and is as candid as you requested.
<br>
<p>With all my thoughts and support.
<br>
<p>Rob
