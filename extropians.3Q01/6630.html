<p>I agree with Spike. I taught my daughter to respect the truth and, above
<br>
all, not to lie to herself. But I also taught her that there are
<br>
circumstances under which the morally correct thing to do is to lie. For
<br>
example, say someone arrives at my house looking for my daughter to kill
<br>
her. I happen to know she's hiding in the cellar. The morally correct thing
<br>
to do is to lie and either say I don't know where she is or give a false
<br>
location.
<br>
<p>I don't much care for the idea of altered Koran text, except that it was a
<br>
relief to read something upbeat and lighthearted for a change. One of my
<br>
firmest rules is never to take anything too seriously, not even suffering
<br>
and death (and I speak as one who has suffered and been close to death).
