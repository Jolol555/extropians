<br>
<em>&gt; Unrestrained capitalism (think early industrial US) leads to huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discrepancies in the distribution of wealth, which leads to social unrest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (think the early labor movement) and even upheaval (think French
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Revolution).
</em><br>
<p>What made the early industrial US so dynamic and energetic was the
<br>
discrepancies you mention. That's the wonderful beauty of extropic
<br>
organization, which relies on differences in energy levels to keep things in
<br>
motion, as opposed to the entropic equalization of levels of energy
<br>
everywhere. See, egalitarianism is like heat death, where there is nothing
<br>
going on, and everything is leveled out and the life energy of the system is
<br>
depleted because there's no variance, no motive, no inequality to make things
<br>
interesting. Capitalism is like biology, it thrives on variation and
<br>
difference and mutation and change and increasing complexity, as opposed to
<br>
the boring flatness of equal distribution which correlates to stasis.. Social
<br>
unrest is the catalyst that initiates change and converts the stagnation of
<br>
outdated regimes into revolutionary amplification of excellence. Unrestrained
<br>
capitalism is like a chain reaction of creativity that uplifts all who
<br>
participate. Transhumanists do indeed think Revolution (!), and eagerly
<br>
anticipate the coming upheaval, the runaway acceleration of societal
<br>
evolution, the quickening pace of computational power, the shocking phase
<br>
transition of all life on this planet and beyond. Laissez les bon temps
<br>
rouler, rouler! Viva la revolucion! Let's get it on!
