[The following is a note I sent to some friends this morning defending a
<br>
short note I sent to them last night immediately after Bush's speeh last
<br>
night, in which i stated that we might have witnessed a &quot;pivotal moment in
<br>
history.&quot;]
<br>
<p>Friends:
<br>
<p>Let me defend briefly -- and before I've finished my first cup of coffee
<br>
(never a good idea, admittedly) -- my hyperbole of last night about Bush's
<br>
*speech* being a &quot;pivotal moment in history.&quot;  These are the things that led
<br>
me to write those words:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a distinct lack of
<br>
morality in the conception of the foreign policy of the United States.
<br>
After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, and
<br>
with China slowly but surely abandoning its communist ideological position
<br>
toward its own people and the world, there has not been a basis for a clear
<br>
moral contrast between the values of liberty, opnness and tolerance upon
<br>
which the civilization of the West is premised, and the civilizations with
<br>
which it competes for influence in the world.  Last night, an unmistakable
<br>
line was drawn between things that are good and right and things that are
<br>
evil.  Although it was done in a distinctly American way in a distinctly
<br>
American voice, the call went out to the world to make a clear-cut choice.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; Bush made an unmistakable and succesful attempt to define this moment
<br>
not only in terms of US policy, but also as a moment of global decision.  By
<br>
citing the nationalities of non-Americans who died in the WTC, he showed
<br>
that the line between liberty and tyranny, between right and wrong is *not*
<br>
culturally bound, but is one that transcends culture, although it is
<br>
grounded in culture. Bush's speech defined a fine but crucial line between
<br>
Islam in general on the one hand, and totalitarian fundamentalism on the
<br>
other.  If his speech now marks a central pillar of US foreign policy, then
<br>
we have seen a decisive retreat from the mailaise of cultural relativism
<br>
that has been eating our society from the inside out.  George W. Bush stood
<br>
up in front of the world last night and condemned a way of thinking -- a
<br>
coherent and for many people appealing world-view --  as fundamentally
<br>
*wrong*.  Let this be a return to the core values of the Enlghtenment upon
<br>
which the American Republic was founded -- and let those values now be seen
<br>
as universally applicable, and we will indeed have seen a &quot;pivotal moment in
<br>
history.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; Whether President Bush's speech will have in fact been a &quot;pivotal moment
<br>
in history&quot; only time will tell.  Here is my hope and why I think it could
<br>
be such a moment.  Having defined the issues in moral terms premised on the
<br>
foundation of liberty, this administration -- and ones to follow -- can now
<br>
have the strength to avoid the kinds of short-term thinking that caused us
<br>
to arm and train bin Laden in the first place and has led us to alliances
<br>
with the absolute worst scum of humanity in the past.  We have said we will
<br>
be patient and that we will maintain our resolve.  Let us do so.  Success
<br>
will be measured in both the ends and the means and they will be measured
<br>
against a yardstick of how true our actions are to the values for which we
<br>
are fighting.  Our alliances can now be legitimately guaged in terms not
<br>
just of whether this or that tin-pot dictator or wild-eyed ideologue will
<br>
provide us with a place to launch an air strike, but in terms of whether a
<br>
nation tolerates diversity, allows free expression and promotes the general
<br>
freedom and welfare of its citizens.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; On a finer scale, Tony Blair's presence in the House last night, and
<br>
Bush's simple, heartfelt &quot;thank you for coming, friend,&quot; provides a hard
<br>
blow against the anti-American Europhiles in England.  The swarm of
<br>
collectivist cockroaches in Brussels will have a much harder time whispering
<br>
their poison into the ears of Britain now.  This could bring a sea-change in
<br>
the Mother Country, and give a real boost to the proponents of the
<br>
Anglospheric conception of world leadership that offers a real alternative
<br>
to a Europe slipping into slumber.
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt; Consider the confused but dangerous yammering of the &quot;anti-globalists.&quot;
<br>
Where do they stand?  Their program of cultural balkanaziation provides the
<br>
perfect breeding ground for bin Laden's vermin.  They are without doubt an
<br>
unwitting fifth column for his brand of international &quot;cultural terrorists,&quot;
<br>
because in the deeply divided world they seek to create, Islamic
<br>
fundamentalism will thrive as a powerful and motivated universalist
<br>
ideology. Bush defined at least the beginnings of an internationalist
<br>
mentality that can be premised on values strong enough to withstand both the
<br>
calls of the critics to step back from progress and the jihad of the armed
<br>
mullahs.  Again, if Bush has begun the process of recasting the West's
<br>
identity in terms of vigorous self-confidence, then we have indeed seen a
<br>
&quot;pivotal moment in history&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, for some coffee.
