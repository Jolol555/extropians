</em><br>
<p>The reporter wrote these figures: 300,000 protesters and 60,000 cops.
<br>
Unfortunately cops were just 15,000, partly inside the &quot;red&quot; area, where
<br>
was the summit + 5,000 journalists + 9,000 people attending the meeting,
<br>
partly inside the surrounding &quot;yellow&quot; area. About 200,000 protesters 
<br>
were inside the &quot;yellow&quot; area, trying to break through the &quot;red&quot; zone
<br>
(about 1,500 protesters with molotov bottles, bars, stones, etc.). 
<br>
-s.
