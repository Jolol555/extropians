From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Questions%20about%20the%20Singularity&In-Reply-To=&lt;006601c13813$8ce77e40$c8c8f418@southmount.com&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt; I think you are mixing up the concept of the singularity with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putative properties of posthumans.
</em><br>
As I understand it, many uses of the word 'singularity' imply that there
<br>
will be a certain type of posthuman, namely, one with intellectual
<br>
capacities that transcend the human, all too human. (That is, the
<br>
singularity implies the posthuman (but not vice versa)). Do you not accept
<br>
this implication?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Using this way of reasoning christian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theology is clearly linked to eudaimonism, since God ought to be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good at understanding eudaimonia.
</em><br>
<p>Right. Aquinas and many other Christian thinkers are interpreted as
<br>
eudamonists. Some go so far as to say that Aquinas singualar contribution to
<br>
ethics is to wed Christian and Aristotelian thinking. Historically, the
<br>
concept of eudaimonia has been filled in a variety of ways. If it is to be
<br>
our rallying point then it requires articulation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What Waldemar was originally pointing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out is that the singularity concept in our discourse tends to draw undue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention to highly hypothetical futures which are also implied to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unknowable and quite often appear static, and asking whether this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't limit our eudaimonic striving.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I understand that he said this. I don't know if I understand why. As I
<br>
pointed out previously, even Aristotle, whose name Waldemar invokes, has a
<br>
conception of the telos of humanity that it quite static, namely emulating
<br>
the unmoved mover. Suppose we conceded for the sake of the argument that
<br>
Waldemar is right that the singularity is static and unknowable. How does
<br>
this limit our eudaimonic stiving now? If your goal is to get rich so that
<br>
you can sit around and doing nothing all day how does this necessarily limit
<br>
your striving today? Surely it is consistent for me to redouble my efforts
<br>
today to achieve my goal of being a sloth tomorrow. I think Waldemar would
<br>
do us a service if he could explain a bit better the connection he sees
<br>
between the singularity and a lack eudaimonic striving.
<br>
Mark.
