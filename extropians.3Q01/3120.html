</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'm getting a little worried.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry, can't back you on this one.  Forums are best held together not by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceived obligation of &quot;openness&quot;, but by open-minded people who aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afraid of being *accused* of close-mindedness, and are hence willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undertake the pruning necessary to keep discussions intelligent.
</em><br>
<p>I do not disagree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Discussions are moved forward, not by the ten thousand critics who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong and clueless, but by the hundred critics who are wrong and smart,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and above all by the one critic who is smart and right.
</em><br>
<p>Let me guess who you think that one critic might be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seeking out that one critic requires that you be willing to tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ten thousand others to go do their repetitive babbling on some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other mailing list that's actually interested.
</em><br>
<p>As if that is going to achieve the desired goal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Smart critics are *valuable*.  The one critic who's right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't likely to stick around and put in the effort to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; himself(*) heard if he sees that you aren't doing anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but arguing the same basic subjects over and over.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, absolutely.  Shortness of space, and conciseness forced
<br>
me to omit mention that everyone's time is limited, that
<br>
many people have much more interesting things to do, and
<br>
that not everyone would have the taste for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The ten thousand useless critics, having vastly overestimated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own intelligence, will insist that you are being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close-minded.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it would be so good if we had an objective way to avoid
<br>
overestimating our own capabilities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Every objection, no matter how stupid, deserves to be answered; every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critic, no matter how clueless, deserves to be debated; but most of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deserve to be answered and debated after the Singularity, not right now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I'm busy.
</em><br>
<p>I understand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyone want to revive the Committee on Un-Extropian Activities?  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list could really use it.
</em><br>
<p>Would you please clarify?  I don't know if you are being sarcastic
<br>
or not.  The persecutorial nature of the old HUAC is well-known, of
<br>
course; but since lists *really are* censored from time to time, and
<br>
it's conceivable that some body of extropians might take this upon
<br>
themselves, you might be serious.  Was there really such a committee
<br>
in the days before I joined the list, to your knowledge?
