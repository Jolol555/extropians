Eugene pointed out something in his most recent message something
<br>
that I hadn't thought much about previously which was harmonic
<br>
interference between assembler arms operating simultaneously.
<br>
<p>I think it is useful to note that it should be possible to isolate
<br>
the arms from one another using acoustical shielding techniques.
<br>
I believe in buildings for example they may put layers of
<br>
lead sheeting between floors to provide such isolation.  You
<br>
could imagine diamondoid assembler arms sitting on diamondoid
<br>
islands embedded in lead seas.  There are probably other methods
<br>
as well for disrupting the transmission of any local vibrations
<br>
to remote locations such as layers of materials with different
<br>
acoustic transmission velocities.
<br>
<p>I suspect it may also be possible to have &quot;active&quot; cancellation
<br>
technologies just as we now have noise-suppressing headsets
<br>
that cancel out background noise such as that found on airplanes.
<br>
<p>Finally since the assembler arms are &quot;programmable&quot; you can program
<br>
their operational timing so any oscillations they might generate
<br>
will tend to cancel each other out rather than interfere with each other.
<br>
<p>Since as Josh pointed out [1], the mass self-replication time for
<br>
a properly designed assembly line could be as small as 1 millisecond,
<br>
you have lots of design room in which to play (assembler spacings,
<br>
timings, etc.) to avoid this problem without seriously impacting
<br>
being able to assemble useful stuff before hell freezes over.
<br>
<p>Eugene's point is useful to consider but I don't think it is a
<br>
showstopper.
