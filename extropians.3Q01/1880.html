<p>FWIW (maybe zilch), I haven't chased the following down yet, so they could

be crackpot, but a guy sent me some urls that look salient, after a local
<br>
journo, mentioned below, cited my views in The Age newspaper:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;- <a href="http://www.users.bigpond.com/putland/sixmonth.htm">http://www.users.bigpond.com/putland/sixmonth.htm</a> has material from Dr.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Gavin Putland that closely lines up with the GNI Sue-Anne Post described,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and also has a fair number of links to do with this whole area (he calls it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Universal Basic Income or UBI). She might want to look at that first, if she
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hasn't already come across this sort of stuff in preparing her article.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- <a href="http://users.netlink.com.au/~peterl/publicns.html#AFRLET2">http://users.netlink.com.au/~peterl/publicns.html#AFRLET2</a> is my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;publications page, with a fair bit of my own work in a somewhat similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;direction but about a year out of date. It isn't the same though - my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;approach (Negative Payroll Tax or NPT) works a bit differently at a number
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of levels, even though it works out the same in the long run.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- <a href="http://www.faxfn.org/feedback/right/issue_03/jobs_tax.htm#23feb98a">http://www.faxfn.org/feedback/right/issue_03/jobs_tax.htm#23feb98a</a> is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;material from Professor Kim Swales of Strathclyde University and his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;colleagues. You can also reach it at the part indicated by &quot;this scheme
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would simultaneously increase employment and reduce taxation&quot; under &quot;Taxes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and Jobs&quot; via the site <a href="http://www.faxfn.org/">http://www.faxfn.org/</a>. It has stuff that works out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the same as my approach, only his reasoning comes at it a different way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which is far heavier on the economics. Unfortunately there's no easy way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around this; my way is heavy on the mathematics, though I left out just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about all of it in my summaries.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;For now, I'd just like to mention a few points, without giving the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supporting material for reasons of brevity:-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- There are time scale issues on just how a GNI would work out. The thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is, unlike my own and Kim Swales' approach, it would have to be paid out and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;administered by the government, from funds raised elsewhere. Sue-Anne Post
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is right in thinking that eventually all the savings would pretty much pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for it, or maybe more (in fact, Kim Swales' work suggests a GDP improvement
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of about half the employment improvement in percentage terms, so maybe 3 or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;4%, which would boost yields of growth taxes). But all this would have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work through, and meanwhile there would be extra administration and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inefficiency in handling the GNI even while Social Security costs etc. were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still in place. So improvement would be slow and would have up front costs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;during a transition. And existing deterioration wouldn't stop while we were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;waiting for things to come right from a GNI; we might not gain on our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problems. (Not a reason to give up - just a reason to look for something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even better while we did what we could.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- Whether or not a GNI eventually led to bludging and economic collapse, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to easier survival all round with everyone working, would depend on just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what levels of support we reached (and also what we could do to stop the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;balance of payments blowing out and to raise our levels of saving). It turns
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out that there are three scenarios: no change to talk of, if GNI levels were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;too small; bludging and collapse if they were too high; and a middle level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where nobody got enough GNI to live off, but where workers' and employers'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expectations had dropped enough that there were enough low paid jobs around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so everybody could work enough to make up at least the difference, maybe a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bit more. But we can't tell just what that level ought to be - certainly not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;$500 per week if even a few gave up work on that; it would have to be a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less than Social Security. Again, Kim Swales' work and my own finding that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our approaches work out the same as GNI in the long run give us a clue; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might even work out if the levels were as low as 5% of average wages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- While my own NPT avoids some of these problems, both NPT and GNI need some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kind of tax around, and if these taxes were the wrong sort like a heavy GST
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or One Nation's &quot;Easytax&quot; they would have to change to work in a way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strangled investment - not from the levels of tax, but from the way taxes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would blow out for anyone who tried investing a bit more. In economics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;jargon, the taxes might have high marginal rates on investment. That means
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that whatever was done, the right kind of tax reform would have to come
</em><br>
<em>&gt;first or we would have to phase things in slowly enough to cope. And there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are a lot of non-economic issues, like trusting the government to do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right and not let any bureaucrat put individuals on a blacklist for what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should be standard benefits.
