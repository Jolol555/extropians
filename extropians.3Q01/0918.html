<em>&gt;From: &quot;E. Shaun Russell&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:e_shaun@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20Sorry&In-Reply-To=&lt;v03110700b7732f825f8b@[213.6.54.212]&gt;">e_shaun@extropy.org</a>&gt;, Tue, 10 Jul 2001 13:54:44
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Congratulations to those of you who just chased another person off of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extropians list.  Perhaps, if you're lucky, we'll wind up with only a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dozen with exact same ideas on everything.  That would be wonderful,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wouldn't it?
</em><br>
<p>Sarcasm aside, at least the person who wrote Merriss was so overwhelmingly
<br>
uhmm.. uncivilized (?), that she had every right to say 'fuck off', after
<br>
the first word of his/her email.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Frankly, I'm tired of seeing this happen.  True, it isn't often as explicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as this case,
</em><br>
<p>agreed.. Some of us weren't so lucky to have such an explicit email,
<br>
but we still had to face rude and inconsiderate communication
<br>
privately/professionally from a list member (which feels very abusive
<br>
if you already said I'M NOT INTERESTED three or four times over a very
<br>
long period of time).
<br>
<p>Yes, it's indeed enough to scare you off of the list, to not want to
<br>
go to Extro meetings and so on, especially if you are the sort of person
<br>
who has no experience of being forcefully rude to someone, so that they'll
<br>
go away. Life is a great teacher, however.
<br>
<p>Since I learned my own hard lessons of not bringing up the problem
<br>
of the offensive list member sooner to the Extro board, let me say
<br>
to any others here: If you are in a situation where someone on the
<br>
list is intruding in your private and/or professional life to cause
<br>
you distress, please tell Max, Natasha, E. Shaun and Greg Birch as
<br>
soon as possible.
<br>
<p>If we can't put our own personal houses in order with care and respect
<br>
how can we  hope to plant seeds that will take root elsewhere?
<br>
<p>Amara
<br>
<p>P.S. to Merriss: I hope that you  alerted the Extro board
<br>
and told the writer of that message to 'fuck off'
<br>
