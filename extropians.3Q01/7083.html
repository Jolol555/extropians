<p>(Naturally, I would like to see that Clean Card combined with a universal

social contract, but it's likely that this would have to come later and

separately.)
<br>
<p>Anyway, the above is an actual solution to terrorism that could work,
<br>
without violating anyone's civil rights, and without any huge, possibly
<br>
useless, military operation.   Comments?
<br>
<p><p>#### I love your proposal. Voluntary  testing in a &quot;truth machine&quot; (be it an
<br>
MRI &quot;brain fingerprinting&quot;, testing for the P300 response, narcoanalysis,
<br>
MEG, or a combination of these and novel techniques), after which the
<br>
successfully tested person would be allowed more access to e.g. certain
<br>
private venues or sensitive public areas, is *the* answer to a lot of our
<br>
problems. I would be willing to pay a premium to live in a community where
<br>
all inhabitants would be tested (including me) for certain antisocial
<br>
tendencies. I would be more confident dealing with a business whose
<br>
proprietors are certifiably honest. Flying in an airplane whose pilot is not
<br>
a nut trying to commit suicide (like this Egyptian guy a year or so ago),
<br>
would be easier on my nerves, too. And, last but not least, I would never
<br>
vote for a politician saying he won't be tested, because this would &quot;violate
<br>
his human dignity&quot;, or some other flimsy excuse.
<br>
<p>All this could be done privately, with no need for extensive governmental
<br>
intrusion. Persons who have something to hide would not become my neighbors,
<br>
business associates, or friends, without me being aware of it and freely
<br>
consenting to it. It would be based on voluntary decisions of all involved
<br>
and would greatly expand the scope of possible social arrangements, just
<br>
like the development of reporting agencies (e.g. Experian and the MIB)
<br>
allowed the existence of modern credit and insurance industries. 
<br>
<p>I am looking forward to a future of (almost) total transparency, with all of
<br>
us knowing all there is to know about everybody, including those in power.
<br>
<p>Rafal Smigrodzki
<br>
<p>And, be the way, MIB is Medical Information Bureau.
