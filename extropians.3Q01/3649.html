<br>
<p>I had already tried a google search and failed to find good sources.  I
<br>
found a lot of variations and dates for this quote, but could not find an
<br>
exact attribution.  Everybody seems to quote this, but nobody gives an
<br>
actual citation for where they are copying this quote from.  However, I was
<br>
eventually able to find these references:
<br>
<p>Jesse Jacks apparently said this at an &quot;Operation PUSH&quot; meeting in Chicago
<br>
in 1993.
<br>
<p>Jeff Jacoby quoted this in his November 18, 1999 Boston Globe article.  He
<br>
says that Jackson made this statement back in 1993.  He does not give any
<br>
references or clues to track down the source of this quote.
<br>
<p>Mike Royko quoted this in his 1993 column in the Chicago Tribune.  He quotes
<br>
Jesse Jackson as saying this at a &quot;recent&quot; meeting of &quot;Operation PUSH&quot; in
<br>
Chicago.  He says he had &quot;run across&quot; this quote, so it is not clear if he
<br>
is quoting some other unidentified source.
<br>
<p>Clarence Page quotes this in the Chicago Tribute Jan. 5, 1994 article.
<br>
<p>Other sources give references to the Dec. 17 1993 edition of the Wall Street
<br>
Journal.
<br>
<p>All the reports seem to be second hand from friend-of-a-friend sources at
<br>
the meeting.  I am not sure if there were any reporters or direct witnesses
<br>
who quoted this.  However, the widespread reports of this in reputable
<br>
newspapers near the time of the incident seem to indicate that this was a
<br>
real news story and not an urban legend.  I don't know if Jesse Jackson
<br>
confirms or denies these reports, but they seem pretty consistent and
<br>
credible.
<br>
<p>I don't have access to the newspaper archives right now, so I can't look
<br>
these up directly.
