<em>&gt;From: Greg Burch &lt;<a href="mailto:gregburch@gregburch.net?Subject=Re:%20Cultural%20Context&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108261752.f7QHqFB02617@pheidippides.md.chalmers.se&gt;">gregburch@gregburch.net</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As I use the term, &quot;PC&quot; applies to a set of ideas, values and goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;characterized by:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;&gt; post-modernist subjectivism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;&gt; extreme cultural relativism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;&gt; crypto-marxist condemnation of capitalism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;&gt; antipathy to:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &lt;&gt; &quot;patriarchy&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &lt;&gt; Anglic culture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &lt;&gt; exercise of American political and military power in the world outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the US
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'll be. This is exactly what characterizes the (amusingly called)
<br>
&quot;progressist intellectual&quot; group in Argentina. To a great degree, they are
<br>
the dominant intellectual current in academia, trade unions, and social
<br>
activism groups. Now the whole thing starts to make sense to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now, the problem in the contemporary cultural scene is that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;constellation of cultural values and vectors is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;&gt; almost wholly identified with &quot;the left&quot; (i.e. U.S. left-Democrats and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Social Democrats everywhere else)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;&gt; at least in the U.S., became the dominant cultural foundation in academia
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and, to a great extent in influential parts of the media
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;&gt; had a head-start as a fairly self-conscious ideology vis-a-vis the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reactive &quot;cultural conservative&quot; constellation that developed in response to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it.
</em><br>
<p>In our case, the identification with the Left is essential to this group.
<br>
They also dominate certain parts of the media, though given the recent years'
<br>
integration of the Argentine media with foreign networws and owners, it
<br>
is a relatively small (though influential) part. The difference I see is that,
<br>
for us, it grew as a response to the &quot;cultural conservative&quot; long prevailing
<br>
tradition in politics and culture, not the other way around as you suggest
<br>
(if I didn't misundestand that).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;All of these factors came together -- again in the U.S., certainly -- to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;create a mentality of &quot;siege&quot; in the last two decades among many people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perceive &quot;PC&quot; to be a bad thing.  People who came of age in American
</em><br>
<em>&gt;academia in the 1970s and 1980s, especially -- and did not buy into the PC
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cultural paradigm -- correctly perceived that a major element of U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;culture had been essentially &quot;hijacked&quot; by a group of people whose values
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and goals were very different from those who had created the institutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that were being overtaken by policies and ideas shaped by &quot;the PC paradigm&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>We lack the siege mentality, since from the '60s onwards the &quot;progressists&quot;
<br>
and the &quot;conservatives&quot; have clashed frontally and publically. In addition
<br>
to the previous &quot;nationalist aristocratic&quot; vs &quot;nationalist populist&quot; conflict
<br>
axis, this more recent one overlapped with it in all kinds of strange mutations
<br>
and puzzling bed-partnerships in the political parties and even dictatorships.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Cultural phenomena often tend to operate &quot;out of synch&quot; with each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This seems to be the case with attitudes toward the PC paradigm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Significant centers of cultural power have now coalesced around values
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distinct from the PC paradigm, but many participants in those other cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;streams still feel isolated and overwhelmed by the PC paradigm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Unfortunately, almost all of those new cultural streams are reactive: &quot;The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Moral Majority,&quot; the nasty white power groups and the like.
</em><br>
<p>We lack the cultural centers coalescing around non-PC values. The people
<br>
who actively act and believe in non-PC ideas don't much care for that,
<br>
only for keeping control of the economy. The few actively proselitist
<br>
intellectuals or media stars embodying the equivalent of your reactive
<br>
streams have been hopelessly clumsy and risible. The sad effect of this
<br>
is a discredit for pro-market and related ideas/ideologies for most of
<br>
the population.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;One phenomenon that I believe can be attributed in part to a reaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against the inroads made by the PC paradigm into U.S. cultural institutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is the renaissance of classical liberalism -- with its modern American label
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of &quot;libertarianism&quot; -- in groups like the Cato Institute, publications like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Reason magazine, and renewed interest in both the origins of and the modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expression of libertarian theory.  This trend is largely an attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;salvage the liberal foundation of Western culture in a way that is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reactionary.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt you can find a classical liberal in Argentina even if you dig
<br>
on the graveyards. Self-called &quot;liberals&quot; in our country are just
<br>
oligopolist kleptocrats that wave all the pro-market flags without ever
<br>
actually allowing markets to happen. This is worrisome, as the majority
<br>
of people actually believe the plundering and cronyism is what markets
<br>
are about, since that's what can be seen of the &quot;liberals&quot; and people
<br>
believe this is what markets are about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Relative newcomers to the list should be aware that extropianism is, in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very general sense, part of this latter cultural phenomena.  Although the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;general cultural impetus that gave rise to the renaissance in liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought (in the original sense of the word) at the end of the 20th and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beginning of the 21st centuries may have been reactive (to the seizure by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the proponents of post-modernism and the PC paradigm of the &quot;commanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heights&quot; of cultural institutions), extropianism is NOT a &quot;reactionary&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophy.  Unfortunately, too many people who are steeped in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vocabulary of the contemporary polarization of political and cultural life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; get confused about this.
</em><br>
<p>I suspect in our current cultural and socioeconomic setting, a public
<br>
exposition of extropianism in Argentina will get you quickly labeled as
<br>
&quot;reactionary capitalist exploiter&quot;. Though considering the prevailing
<br>
ignorance about almost anything, I reckon most of the people would just
<br>
look at you with a &quot;huh?&quot; instead, only the &quot;progressists&quot; jumping on your
<br>
neck.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The other day I joined in condemnation of material that had come from an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;essentially reactionary web site, pointing out that we have to see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;context in which something is offered to really understand the CULTURAL
</em><br>
<em>&gt;SIGNIFICANCE of that material.  ASSESSING THE CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE OF
</em><br>
<em>&gt;SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT FROM DETERMINING ITS TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD.  This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fundamentally important distinction that is being missed in almost all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussions about public policy and ethics here lately, from posts about IQ
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tests, to discussion of financing and control of education, to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reparations discussion, to the talk about what people mean when they use the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;word &quot;Mexican&quot;.  Interestingly, I think we're seeing a real example of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different styles of thought and discourse among &quot;the two cultures&quot;: In the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sciences, there's really no merit to talking about the cultural significance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of a proposition; it's either true or false, testable or not, fruitful or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not.  In the humanities and politics, truth, testability and fruitfulness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are important, but they aren't the whole story.
</em><br>
<p>Again, this kind of situation is not exactly what troubles us. You have the
<br>
&quot;progressist&quot; culture, and on the other hand a desert, with the occasional
<br>
ridiculously inept defense of vague &quot;liberal&quot; ideas (most of the time
<br>
just done in a purely lip-service way). I WISH we had two cultures
<br>
discoursing. Public discourse starts to look more and more like a guy
<br>
yelling the same old lines ad nauseam, while the other guy just leaves the
<br>
debate hall to see how he can add some new screws to his oligopoly machine
<br>
in case the yelling guy grabs a stick and starts to bang on it.
