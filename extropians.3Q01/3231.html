<p>Well, according to his own philosophy he should have been able to remember
<br>
reading it if it was true :-) Seriously, I agree that we are in the same
<br>
big stream of philosophy that proclaims human perfectability (or at least
<br>
improvability), but that in the end we have to part ways with Platon since
<br>
his philosophy doesn't seem compatible with the full individualism of
<br>
transhumanism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt;Also, this telos is

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (after all, we have plenty of convergentists here who think future

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actualisation, but that might be something more akin to the plurality of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Aristotelian virtues rather than a single ideal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aristotle held that there was a plurality of virtues, but so did Plato. (See
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Julia Annas, _Platonic Ethics Old and New). Of course this plurality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed to be unified, hence the doctrine of human flourishing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (eudaemonism). Both held that the best account of human flourishing is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become as godlike as possible.
</em><br>
<p>OK, I'm not that well read on Platon as I ought to be. The interesting
<br>
question is whether &quot;everything that rises must converge&quot; towards some
<br>
ideal eudaemonic flourishing which is essentially the same, or whether the
<br>
rising instead leads to divergence in kinds of virtues, which may still be
<br>
unified and harmonious within the individual but different from individual
<br>
to individual. I would think the later view is more in the Aristotelian and
<br>
transhumanist direction. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; I think Plato would be horrified by the idea of transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not sure myself what Plato would have thought. His writings are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploratory and tentative, not doctrinaire. But even if he was horried so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what? Some philosophers get very upset with the idea that their views might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need changing or updating. (We can all think of at least one, if we think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objectively.)
</em><br>
<p>:-) 
<br>
<p>Overall, my impression is that Plato was no fan of having a dynamic,
<br>
changing society, and the profound and accelerating changes we discuss are
<br>
very much the antithesis of this. Someone who suggested outlawing new music
<br>
in the ideal society is not likely to like the idea of people getting new
<br>
bodies. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;- we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seeking to become something different from human, and we gladly accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With respect to Plato, it depends what you mean by 'human'. Plato held that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of us have a divine element in us. With the help of philosophy we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultivate that element and sublimate the less rational parts of our soul. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plato sees this sort of change as good: overcome the &quot;human all too human&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of your soul and emphasize the divine element of your soul.
</em><br>
<p>True. This is of course an area where modern transhumanism has to do some
<br>
serious work too. We need a better definition of human and what is worth
<br>
improving in the human. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In Plato's view (which in this respect seem amusingly similar to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Jeremy Rifkin's in _Entropy_) change is a bad thing, due to our remoteness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from the Ideal. The only acceptable change is towards an ideal state, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then it would stop.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not sure what you mean by the last two sentences. (Is this your view or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plato's in the last sentence?)
</em><br>
<p>My impression of Plato's view. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Plato's view is that change towards the ideal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is good. The project on earth here is to order our world to make it more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; godlike. The political part of this project, of course, is described in The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Republic (and elsewhere). Plato sees change as terminating once we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reached perfection. Indeed, it would be wrong to change once perfection is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reached. Of course if change for its own sake is part of perfection then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plato is wrong. Mark
</em><br>
<p>Somehow I can't see change being part of perfection in the original
<br>
Platonic system, it was very much based on the idea of eternal unchanging
<br>
forms being the important stuff. Maybe it got changed in Platonism 2.0 or
<br>
95, but it still seems a bit incompatible with the rest. 
<br>
<p>This is where I think things would have been very different if Platon had
<br>
read Darwin, thermodynamics, modern cosmology and Kevin Kelly. We live in a
<br>
rather different universe these days - it is inherently dynamic and
<br>
changing, and not obviously for the worse. Rather for the more complex.
