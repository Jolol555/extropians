</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;What would it take at minimum?  Four crews of say 3-4 people

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't see why this would need to be planned that terribly far

</em><br>

<p>Yeah i can't agree more, ppl talking about how difficult this operation 
<br>
must have been
<br>
imho are missing the point. The basic piloting skills could well have been 
<br>
picked up over a
<br>
few weeks with a mid range PC and MS flight simulator. Since once in the 
<br>
air and on a basic
<br>
heading no great skill would be require to direct a jet into a large building.
<br>
<p>What i have be wondering about is the level of icy determined all consuming 
<br>
hatred it takes,
<br>
to board and aircraft with 3-4 colleagues, and then kill yourself and 
<br>
possibly several thousand other
<br>
complete strangers. by crashing into a building.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Also as I said, 4 airliners not on flight plan? And no red flags are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; off. If nothing else there should be a scramble to find and track the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for their own protection in case some weird error is happening in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nations flight control system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From what I have understood there was one other bit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sophistication, knowing how to turn off some of the tracking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;devices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And all of this in a situation where individuals have allowed government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intrusion into their lives, accept four hour check in times, etc just so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this would not happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To me that is incompetency beyond belief.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe worth mentioning that air security specialists in Europe have been 
<br>
aghast at the loose
<br>
security on US internal flights for years. The idea of minimal baggage 
<br>
checks and NO passport
<br>
or ID checks is something that i suspect makes most European security 
<br>
specialists shudder.
