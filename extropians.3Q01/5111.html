<p>
I'm suggesting getting rid of public schools for private and letting the
<br>
<em>&gt;private school decide how to do its job. If you dont like a low cost, high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;volume school, dont go to it. You'll have a choice to go where ever you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and can afford. Its the same point as to why it cost more now to hire a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;private full time tutor then go to private school. If you want to be cheap,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;send your kid to the K-mart version (as if those types of schools didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already exist). I would expect the norm classroom size to stay about where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is and the cost of doing it to drop a good chunk with private industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doing it. Your choice here is McDonalds Hamburgers, eating at nice dinner 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Chilis retaurant, or Filet Mingon from an expensive restaurant. All options
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be available!
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Of course the only real options would be available to the wealthy.  The
<br>
rest 
<br>
of us would be relegated to sending our kids to the $.99 Store school.  I 
<br>
know that to some it seems only right that only the rich are entitled first 
<br>
rate educations for their kids.  To me, that just doesn't sit right.
<br>
<p>The simple fact is that a welfare mother is not likely to be able to afford 
<br>
to pay *anything* to educate her children.  If public education is abandoned
<br>
<p>the only alternative for the truly poor would be the school of hard knocks.
<br>
<p>Again, that's the equivolent of saying &quot;let them eat cake.&quot;  Woe to all of 
<br>
us if/when that day ever comes.
<br>
<p>-Zero&quot;
<br>
<p>I strongly disagree with this.  This is same argument that is always made
<br>
against new products 'Why make them, only the rich will get them'  At one
<br>
point in time Automobiles, let alone choices in them, were confined to the
<br>
rich.  Electricity was confined to the rich.  Running water, waste
<br>
management, heat, etc. etc. etc  were ALL, at one time, confined to the
<br>
rich.  Competition and capitalism has brought ALL of these things within the
<br>
realm of the average person.   You are basically saying 'Why privatize
<br>
schools, only the rich will benefit'  this is completely and totally untrue.
<br>
Capitalism and competition by definition will make higher quality products
<br>
and services more available at continually decreasing prices.  Capitalism is
<br>
the natural selection of goods and services.
