Jim Giles finds that by combining the workings of the human brain and
<br>
computers, neuromorphic engineering could step in when human senses fail
<br>
<p>Chips are all ears and eyes
<br>
<p>As anyone who has ever fumed at a computer in frustration will admit,
<br>
computers do not think like us. They are great at big number-crunching jobs.
<br>
They can do our accounts, solve difficult sums, and beat almost anyone on
<br>
the planet at chess. Yet humans and animals have the edge when it comes to
<br>
tasks that are harder to define, such as distinguishing between two faces.
<br>
<p>Could the two ways of working ever be combined? Is it possible to create a
<br>
machine that marries the brute power of silicon chips with the flexibility
<br>
and adaptability of animal thinking? According to neuromorphic engineers,
<br>
the answer is yes.
<br>
<p>Neuromorphic engineering aims to create silicon circuits - the basis of
<br>
modern computers - that mimic the way human and animal brains work. Experts
<br>
in this field, such as Rahul Sarpeshkar of the Massachusetts Institute of
<br>
Technology, are convinced that the future of computing lies in understanding
<br>
why humans and animals are so good at particular tasks, and in building
<br>
computers that work in the same way. &quot;Stupid-looking organisms are doing
<br>
amazing computation,&quot; he says. &quot;We need to replicate this in electronics.&quot;
<br>
<p>The idea of building computers that mimic real brains dates back to the
<br>
1940s, but it was not until the 1980s that the technology needed to build
<br>
&quot;natural&quot; circuits became available. Progress has been steady since, but the
<br>
dramatic improvement in conventional computers over the same period has
<br>
overshadowed the field's successes and deterred investors. Now neuromorphic
<br>
engineering may be ready to make headlines of its own, as a slew of new
<br>
products, from artificial eyes and ears to sensors for intelligent
<br>
buildings, approach the market.
<br>
<p>Few people realise it, but at least one neuromorphic product is already
<br>
available. The Logitech TrackMan mouse is an optical computer mouse - it
<br>
contains a simple vision sensor that tracks the movement of the mouse over
<br>
the desk and sends this information to the computer. Such visual tasks are
<br>
difficult for normal computers, but animals perform them effortlessly. So
<br>
when Logitech wanted to develop the mouse, it turned to nature for
<br>
inspiration.
<br>
<p>The Dutch electrical engineer André van Schaik designs computer circuits,
<br>
but he is also an expert in the way flies see. Impressed by the ease with
<br>
which the tiny brain of a fly makes quick and accurate decisions - such as
<br>
how to avoid an incoming swat - van Schaik designed a circuit that could
<br>
track the motion of objects in the way that a fly does. The result was a
<br>
cheap, low-power circuit that Logitech found was perfect for use in a device
<br>
such as a computer mouse.
<br>
<p>A similar approach may soon lead to sensors for tracking the motion of
<br>
people around buildings, turning lights on and off as they enter and leave
<br>
rooms. Groups at several universities around the world are also working on
<br>
developing a neuromorphic retina, an artificial version of the real thing
<br>
that could restore sight to people with certain kinds of blindness. Trials
<br>
are under way and crude versions have already been implanted into patients.
<br>
However, scientists warn that the human retina is complex, and we are still
<br>
some years away from being able to build a satisfactory artificial version.
<br>
<p>Naturally inspired, artificial versions of the cochlea (the part of the ear
<br>
that converts sounds into the electrical signals that the brain uses) may
<br>
arrive sooner. Artificial cochleae already exist, and are implanted in
<br>
congenitally deaf patients. Although they are crude compared with the real
<br>
thing, the results can be impressive. In the best cases, they enable their
<br>
wearers to conduct telephone conversations.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, many deaf people are put off by the size of the implants. The
<br>
digital processor that converts sound into electrical signals must be worn
<br>
externally. The implant is also power hungry, forcing the wearer to sit next
<br>
to a recharging device for several hours every few weeks.
<br>
<p>In a bid to solve these problems, Chris Toumazou, of Imperial College,
<br>
London, has developed a compact, long-lasting device to replace the normal
<br>
digital processor. Once again, nature was the inspiration.
<br>
<p>The conventional digital processors used in current implants tackle problems
<br>
methodically, like following a recipe to bake a cake. Human cochleae take a
<br>
less systematic but effective approach. This miraculous ability is the
<br>
result of cochleae having being shaped over millions of years of evolution.
<br>
<p>Toumazou has borrowed from evolution to create an artificial cochlea that
<br>
mimics the processing of a human one. The result is a smaller, lower-power
<br>
version of the conventional digital processor; it will fit within the ear
<br>
and should need recharging only once a year. Toumazou hopes to begin
<br>
clinical trials before the end of the year.
<br>
<p>Projects such as these are just the beginning of the potential applications
<br>
of neuromorphic circuits. The computer revolution cannot last for ever, and
<br>
many researchers predict that the relentless increase in the speed and power
<br>
of computers will peak within the next decade.
<br>
<p>Neuromorphic circuits may then be the way forward. If computer scientists
<br>
cannot rely on newer, faster circuits to crack difficult problems, where
<br>
better to look for inspiration than the human brain, the incredible device
<br>
that evolution has already designed for us?
