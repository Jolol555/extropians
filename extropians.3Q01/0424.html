</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is &quot;normal&quot; for humans.  Should I also be allowed to artificially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase my vision to 20-15 because that is &quot;normal&quot; for some people?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This would actually be increasing my vision beyond what most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would consider &quot;normal&quot;.  Most people would consider that &quot;cybernetic&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>That's an amazing story.  I'm glad that you have finally been able to
<br>
have your vision corrected.
<br>
<p>A while back we talked about this article from Popular Science about a
<br>
technology which could potentially give people 20-10 vision using adaptive
<br>
optics: <a href="http://www.popsci.com/exclusive/mar2001/super_vision.html">http://www.popsci.com/exclusive/mar2001/super_vision.html</a>.
<br>
<p>They claim that it could be used with Lasik eye surgery, but having had
<br>
that treatment I am skeptical.  The eye, like any biological tissue,
<br>
reacts somewhat unpredictably to the laser treatment.  My vision
<br>
fluctuated for months, getting better and worse, finally settling down to
<br>
good but not as good as it had been at its best.  Until they have rock
<br>
solid prediction of how the cornea will react, they won't be able to
<br>
guarantee you perfect vision.  But it could still improve the procedure.
<br>
<p>This would not technically qualify as being a cyborg, but it is definitely
<br>
an artificial enhancement that relies heavily on technology.
