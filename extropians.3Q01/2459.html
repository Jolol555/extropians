<p>Ah.  Are you as certain that your idea of technology and what it
<br>
can and will be into the indefinite future is complete enough
<br>
that you can be certain what that future technology (almost
<br>
indistinquishable from magic) will and will not enable?  Are you
<br>
certain that none of that near-magic is not already afoot and
<br>
that none of it had a part in our own being here?  If there is
<br>
an afterlife it will be through technology we can see coming or
<br>
through technology that we don't have much clue about that may
<br>
or may not already be locally present.  
<br>
<p>If you can do uploads and downloads then reincarnation or
<br>
something that looks very much like it is a piece of cake.  
<br>
<p>Are you so sure of how Mind will grow and extend and what its
<br>
limits will ultimately be as to say there is no such Mind
<br>
already present or will not be or that it will not transcend
<br>
time itself?  Are you so utterly certain that all who claim to
<br>
have been touched by such a Mind or have caught a small glimpse
<br>
of it or from within it are simply victims of a biochemical
<br>
storm and nothing else?
