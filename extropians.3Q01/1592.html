<em>&gt; &gt; If we are going to be so discriminating, we need to discriminate by the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relationship of confidence and trust was involved, and individuals must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consistently behave in a manner consistent with that trust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For example, selling web server information about me to anybody while at

<em>&gt; &gt; the same time resisting on 'confidential relationship' grounds against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; law enforcement obtaining the same information is logically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inconsistent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure what &quot;resisting&quot; you are talking about.  Many will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceive a difference between government doing the snooping, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public expense, and private parties doing the snooping.  Agreed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone here might be &quot;logically inconsistent&quot;, but I have less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a problem with that than the use of force or enactment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unnecessary laws (of course).
</em><br>
<p>Well, for example, a porn site says that it won't release your identity
<br>
to law enforcement when you register as a member, but sells your id and
<br>
all your browsing activity to ad and porn marketing companies. This is
<br>
inconsistent. A consistent application would be that either they provide
<br>
date to law enforcement under warrant but do not sell to just anybody,
<br>
or they sell to anybody and wilfully give to law enforcement, or they
<br>
don't give any information to anybody.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Similarly, a doctor refusing to provide health care information to, say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a minor patient's parents, while at the same time providing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information to sundry government agencies and insurance and drug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; companies is similarly inconsistent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe so, but the doctor is within his legal rights to do so,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and should remain free to do so.
</em><br>
<p>Uh, no. Since a minor child is the ward of their parents or other legal
<br>
guardians, performing medical procedures without their authorization on
<br>
their child is highly unethical. I don't care what your personal stance
<br>
is on certain medical procedures like, say, abortion. Ethics and morals
<br>
are meaningless if they are not consistently applied, and children,
<br>
especially, require that we apply morals and ethics consistently if they
<br>
are to become citizens with integrity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you advertise a privacy policy, there should be legal remedies to its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inconsistent application, arbitrary adjustment, or outright abrogation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that those who the information is about have a right to pursue with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meaningful consequences if the violator is found guilty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sounds to me as if you are arguing for &quot;truth in advertizing&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Failure to conform with one's publicly made promises is fraud, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose.  No argument here, if I'm rightly understanding you.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but this is not being enforced, as Harvey illustrated so
<br>
effectively at Extro5.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; One method of dealing with this is to implement actual trust/reputation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brokers that are functional and deal with privacy much as credit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; agencies deal with financial responsibility, and lobby the DMA to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; require that its members post up-to-the-minute trust ratings on their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; privacy policy page.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is entirely different from what you were talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before.  This has little to do with fraud or violation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws, and is a commendable free-market solution that doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impose on anyone's liberties.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is with cross jurisdictional communications like the
<br>
internet. The DMA has little or no membership outside the US, and almost
<br>
none outside North America. Another problem is the implementation. This
<br>
would require that every individual posess an encrypted serialized
<br>
certificate with which they can authorize every instance of their
<br>
private information, and that individuals have an application that
<br>
allows them to query the internet for all instances of their personal
<br>
cookies on instances of their private data on servers around the world.
<br>
This also would require that the application conciously scan for
<br>
instances of the individuals private data and report to a trust bureau
<br>
the server and its owning corporations on which such data is present, or
<br>
from which spam using private data originates.
<br>
<p>Browser applications need to become sophisticated enough that when a
<br>
person selects 'ok' when the form submission dialog pops up that it
<br>
engages these certifying processes. It should also provide data to the
<br>
person browsing of the trust rating of the entity to which the data is
<br>
being submitted.
