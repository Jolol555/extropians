<p>Bullshit.  There is nothing to justify this wild assertion
<br>
except your dim memory of some magazine article sometime in the
<br>
past that could have well got it very much wrong.
<br>
<p>Stallman is a saint.  He saw something he considered wrong and
<br>
limiting and he devoted himself to offering an alternative at
<br>
tremendous personal cost.  Profit is irrelevant to what he was
<br>
concerned with and anyone who reads him knows this.  There is no
<br>
sense of vengeance there.  Besides, if that were his motive he
<br>
would embrace the Open Source world fully instead of continuing
<br>
to distinquish what he thinks is important from what has the
<br>
most
<br>
potential to change the face of software broadly right now.
