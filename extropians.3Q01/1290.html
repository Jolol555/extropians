<p>Windows 98 is very secure, because its code is closed and hackers
<br>
can't find out about its vulnerabilities. They can't even use the
<br>
hacker tactic of posing as developers, because Microsoft *doesn't*
<br>
*even* *document* many of the system calls, or documents them so
<br>
obscurely that you really have to know what you're doing to understand
<br>
it. Microsoft has structured its products such that they can only be
<br>
used for a few legitimate purposes by a few legitimate businesses. You
<br>
can bet that the software Phoenix PCs install is useful, like a patch
<br>
or a new driver or a small advertising banner that helps you, the
<br>
customer, save money. Not Back Orifice and PGP like Linux users would
<br>
install on your machine if they had the chance.
<br>
<p>So hackers have no other recourse than going to public domain software
<br>
and trying to convince the rest of you to follow. Just another example
<br>
of how software has to be proprietary to be any good. I mean, come on!
<br>
Linux software was written by teenage hackers and communists who
<br>
wanted to get something for nothing, while Windows was written by
<br>
seasoned developers (probably all with MCSEs at the very least) and
<br>
state of the art tools like Visual Studio. So which kernel would you
<br>
prefer running your mission-critical floppy drive? Leave the code to
<br>
the specialists, I say. Thousands of Fortune 500 companies, leading
<br>
educational institutions, and the Federal Government can't be wrong.
<br>
<p>PS: Who's Redmond? Win98 was written by Bill Gates last time I
<br>
checked. Get your facts straight.
