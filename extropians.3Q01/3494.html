</em><br>
<p>Yes!
<br>
<p>First: I apologize to those whom I may have offended by submitting
<br>
those questions in the way that I did. The reason I did this was to
<br>
see how many and who would respond in a mature and intellectual manner
<br>
when their beliefs and aspirations were subjected to the indignity of
<br>
such questions.
<br>
<p>Second: The questions themselves do not represent my attitude toward
<br>
Transhumanism or Extropians nor had they anything to do with Damien
<br>
Broderick's book. I had read a posting of his and followed a link
<br>
concerning his book at the time so that got referred to.
<br>
<p>The posting I sent in represents those fears, questions and criticisms
<br>
I have most often encountered on the internet whilst searching out
<br>
info on the subject. I think that it is important to answer these
<br>
questions because they are out there creating resistance and should be
<br>
dealt with.
<br>
<p>I would have eventually submitted them in a different way had not the
<br>
negro criminality thread caused me to wonder if any one would rise to
<br>
the occasion and display enthusiasm for discussion and intellectuality
<br>
and what not when the shoe was on the other foot.
<br>
<p>Such did occur!
<br>
<p>I apologize for the deception.
<br>
<p>Mr. Bones
