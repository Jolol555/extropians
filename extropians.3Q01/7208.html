<em>&gt; You make some good points except for one thing.  We are not just *extropians*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are also people who are justifiably upset, concerned and intent on making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some sense out of what is happening.  In the process we will, among other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things, play amateur analyst and amateur general and amateur diplomat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempting to make sense of it all.  This is not a total waste.
</em><br>
<p><p>I understand this, but a lot of times I think it is taken too far; I should
<br>
have been more specific to the list.
<br>
<p>The extropians list has value, but I think the nature of the value has
<br>
changed with time.  Much of the value I get out of the extropians list is
<br>
the deeply intellectual stuff, and I found the list to be very valuable when
<br>
I first joined it.  I could be beating a dead horse or have completely lost
<br>
perspective, but it seems that many posters these days are on the list
<br>
largely for the social value.  This wouldn't be a problem except that many
<br>
people don't engage in due rigor when they talk in a social mode, which
<br>
ruins the intellectual quality and causes flame wars.
<br>
<p>Every now and then, someone asks about all the extropians list old-timers
<br>
that have disappeared, to which there is typically the &quot;they are doing great
<br>
things instead of talking about them&quot; response.  I wish that were true.  I
<br>
know many of those long lost individuals personally and see them regularly,
<br>
and I see an even broader range of them on an infrequent basis.  Most of
<br>
them are plodding along doing the same things they were when they were on
<br>
the list (some of whom *are* doing interesting things).  But many of them
<br>
feel that the list doesn't offer much value any more, at least not at the
<br>
current S/N, so many interesting discussions get taken offline or in other
<br>
venues.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; What, you expect us all to be in super-genius mode in every aspect of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communications even in areas we are not specialists in but that have just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intruded big-time into our lives?  Who the heck are you to put down people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for this?
</em><br>
<p><p>I am not critiquing what individuals do so much as what individuals do on
<br>
the list.  Maybe I am just being curmudgeonly.  My memory suggests that in
<br>
years past, people were a lot more thoughtful and showed considerably more
<br>
constraint in their posting than they do today.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Please explain to me how I can reach my goals if the internet is turned into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high security no-hacker land, open source software is all but outlawed, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very computer hardware enforces the most brain-dead of IP laws, the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sees everything I write, say and do 24x7 and other nasty possible reactions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to 9/11.  Some of what is likely in the near and long-term as fallout can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a very large effect on my work and on the work of most of us here.
</em><br>
<p><p>And what, exactly, does this have to do with how many Taliban warriors can
<br>
dance on the head of an American pin?  The problem is that a lot of people
<br>
on the list are throwing a lot of unrelated issues into one pile and trying
<br>
to come up with one solution.  Internet censorship has nothing to do with
<br>
Islamic terrorism, even though some people package it that way.  Correlation
<br>
versus causation and all that.  Taking on stupid IP laws and censorship
<br>
proposals didn't require fighting terrorism before, and it doesn't require
<br>
it now either.
<br>
<p>I don't have a problem addressing serious problems head on, but haphazardly
<br>
addressing a tornado of issues at a very coarse level seems futile.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Explain how we can turn our backs effectively on the world and work to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create our &quot;philosopher's stone&quot; be it AI, SI, MNT or whatever and expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to actually be able to have any result be a real improvement in that real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world we have studiously ignored?
</em><br>
<p><p>I never said to ignore the world, but spending all your time thinking about
<br>
alternatives to problems/solutions that are either beyond your control or
<br>
which don't affect you in any significant way won't accomplish much either.
<br>
Just because a terrorist incident is bringing out a laundry list of stupid
<br>
proposals does not mean that you have to fight terrorism or even everything
<br>
on the laundry list.  Resources are not infinite and people have to choose
<br>
their battles.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I have asked this before here and not received a very satisfactory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer.  Exactly why do we believe that our goals, our endgame, is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one that should and must win and that we must make sure it does regardless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what the people at large want or even know about?  In a way we are trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to sneak in our &quot;final solution&quot; as a fait accompli.  On the one hand it looks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beautiful and obvious.  On the other, most of us admit that we have no idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether it will mean we all &quot;win&quot; or whether we all simply become obsolete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and are wiped out of existence.  Yet we should be gung-ho to produce this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever-it-is and whatever-it-does-to-us.  Well, life is not something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that begins only after the Singularity.
</em><br>
<p><p>You bring up valid questions and points here.  Any answer to your question
<br>
would sound preachy, most likely.  I don't have an answer to that myself.
<br>
<p>My continued survival is my first and foremost goal.  If I'm dead, nothing
<br>
else really matters -- game over.  Therefore, the problem for me boils down
<br>
to balancing out threat probabilities as a function of time.  Any immediate,
<br>
high-probability, short time span threat should be neutralized or minimized,
<br>
but not necessarily at the expense of even higher probability threats that
<br>
operate over longer time spans.  Life is a game of constantly balancing
<br>
these things.  If I spend too much time trying to squeeze out tiny
<br>
short-term threat possibilities, I'll die a death of long-term causes while
<br>
I'm not paying attention.  Therefore, I spend just enough resources on the
<br>
immediate threats so that I can get on with solving the long-term, extremely
<br>
high probability threats to my existence, such as aging.  Go ahead and knock
<br>
down some of the minor threats that are here right now, but don't just
<br>
ignore the Big One looming on the horizon.
<br>
<p>As I see it, to solve the problem of the survival you have to solve most of
<br>
the other cool problems out there anyway; it gives me quite a bit to do.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
