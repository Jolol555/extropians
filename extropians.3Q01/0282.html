<em>&gt;&gt; I think there's a big difference between the two -- between &quot;government

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but the difference is irrelevant to this particular debate.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so.  John M. Cobin's point is that government mandated codes
<br>
have a different effect than privately evolved ones.  In particular, he
<br>
brings up two theories of why this might be is so:
<br>
<p>1.  &quot;Regulation is a public choice phenomenon that primarily serves special
<br>
interests.&quot;
<br>
2.  &quot;Regulation is unlikely to increase safety efficiently, and perhaps not
<br>
effectively, because it is always constrained by inadequate local
<br>
knowledge.&quot;
<br>
<p>(See <a href="http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume3/v3i1a2s2.html">http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume3/v3i1a2s2.html</a>, the section &quot;Theories
<br>
about safety regulation.&quot;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; But Cobin does go over just this point in the third section of the essay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (<a href="http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume3/v3i1a2s3.html">http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume3/v3i1a2s3.html</a>) when discussing Santiago's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; building code:  &quot;The legislation was designed to establish compulsory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; construction norms for minimum and maximum building height and the
</em><br>
selection
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of building materials, plus a means to retard the propagation of
</em><br>
fires...&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This code was put into place in 1929, &quot;after a disastrous earthquake
</em><br>
struck
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Talca [another Chilean city] in 1928...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but the fact that he bases his initial premise so faultily condemns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whole exercise.
</em><br>
<p>Wrong!  You are making two assumptions here.  One is that you can dismiss a
<br>
whole essay based on the abstract.  This leads me to ask, did you even
<br>
bother to read it?
<br>
<p>The other is that Cobin's abstract actually contradicts your belief about
<br>
&quot;fire safety regs&quot; being made to &quot;The purpose is to reduce the overall
<br>
damage and death toll of each individual fire.&quot;  I don't see how this
<br>
contradicts his abstract.  In fact, that he focuses on structural fires
<br>
throughout the essay, kind of tells me that he kind of has this in mind.
<br>
<p>Are you just looking for a way to disagree here?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I would hazard to guess -- but confess ignorance here:) -- that, in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; past, most fires, too were small and contained.  It wasn't like London
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; burned done once a decade.  You make it sound as if it did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps not the whole city, but large chunks of it did, in fact. Tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me: how many wooden structures remain in London proper that are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than 250 years old? Very few. How about Chicago? Very few.
</em><br>
<p>But what would this prove?  Even if massive fires did not take out wooden
<br>
structures, eventually, just piecemeal burning of them over a long enough
<br>
period might take them out.  Also, wood structures don't last long even
<br>
without fires anyhow.  How many many hundreds years old wooden structures
<br>
are there worldwide?  Outside of Scandanavia, I bet very few.  Finally, we
<br>
would need to separate out technological, economic, and regulatory changes.
<br>
Large office buildings today, tend to be glass and steel.  (Yet they burn.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A proper study would chart out the percent of individual cities killed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; injured, and left homeless from fire every year before and after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; institution of fire codes in those cities.
</em><br>
<p>Granted.  We would also have to try to estimate the number of people made
<br>
homeless and the lower amount of social wealth that is caused by either
<br>
costly regulation or uneven regulation.  (This brings to mind something that
<br>
happened to a merchant I knew several years ago.  When he became critical of
<br>
the mayor in his town, his store was visited by the fire inspector --
<br>
someone he'd never even met before that -- and visited often.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; What we would need to do is find out if government fire codes have had
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; impact you believe they have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Groups like the ICBO, BOCA, etc. have done numerous studies in the past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this subject illustrating just my point.
</em><br>
<p>I'd have to study the studies before passing judgment here.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
