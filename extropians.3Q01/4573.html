<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Childcare should be provided by the parents, not the government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In your opinion, who should provide for schools - the parents, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;well?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolutely, why should non-parents foot the bill?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Before I get branded an ogre let me explain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a fairly recent convert to the idea of a flat tax (don't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why it took so long!) I think everyone should pay the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; percentage. Now as far as schools are concerned, we would all pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something, but parents would pay additional for each child for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every year they're in school.
</em><br>
<p>Yet even the tax system isn't equally applied to pay for schools. Senior
<br>
citizens typically get the portion of their state and local taxes that
<br>
goes to education exempted, on the rationale that their kids are grown
<br>
and no longer use public schools, and generally are on fixed incomes
<br>
(yet these regs allow people as young as 55 to get the tax break). Yet,
<br>
single people like myself who have no kids, and don't really desire to
<br>
have kids, are required to pay these taxes, despite the fact that we may
<br>
be earning less than a senior on a fixed income, and not have the
<br>
benefits of subsidized housing, etc, and also have a higher cost of
<br>
living (generally vehicular in nature, along with paying off student
<br>
loans, etc).
<br>
<p>I see this as a violation of the equal protection clause.
