I don't know who Cesar Chavez is/was.

Maybe you are being sarcastic or at least ironic when you speak of unions. 
<br>
I know unions are held in deep contempt by many in USA, but although they 
<br>
can go bad (like any other group) they have been a force for good many 
<br>
times in many places of the world. Unions do have their place in the work 
<br>
ecology. They are a way of counterbalancing the excessive power of other 
<br>
groups (managers, politicians, foreign-ownership) that are so easily 
<br>
corrupted and so often treat their workforce as less than cattle.

This is a possibility, though with information age coming fully upon us I 
<br>
wonder if such information hiding will be possible or practical. Maybe. We 
<br>
shall have to see. But it actually would exacerbate the problem while 
<br>
feeling like a quick fix. It would serve to intensify the feelings of hate 
<br>
and resentment in the population at large when they did manage to find an 
<br>
immortal. This would be a very dangerous path to take.
<br>
<p>I can only hope that we choose to become benevolent enablers for the 
<br>
general population.

<p>Yes, though not in any conspiratorial fashion. Luckily increasing numbers

of people are seeing that the wealth and well-being of the entire community

can be enhanced by making information freely available. Making the poor

wealthy can make the rich even more so. It is in everybody's interest to

<p>Yes. It is gradually happening. :-)

This especially great news for people like myself who don't learn well in a

lecture+exam setting. I learn best by teaching myself.

<p>Definitely. Equality of access for all the different kinds of people so

that each can take the road they are best suited to.

I actually wasn't worked up. Rather, I was puzzled and a little incredulous 
<br>
that he had stuck this oddity in here, but I wasn't hot under the collar. I 
<br>
realise now that it reads as if I was... bad choice of expletives on my

part. Hmmm... I should look in on the Human Markup Language (HumanML) group 
<br>
<a href="http://www.humanmarkup.org">http://www.humanmarkup.org</a> to see if they've completed anything yet that 
<br>
would make such things clearer.

<p>Yes. This is having terrific effect wherever it is put into practice. I

have read of wonderful results by the Women's Development Corporation which 
<br>
helps women in poverty-stricken areas and helps them break the cycle of 
<br>
poverty.
<br>
That is not to say that lean and effective groups such as Oxfam which 
<br>
deliver food relief in critical situations are not useful too. They have 
<br>
their place. But corrupt, top-heavy, relief donation groups (World Vision?) 
<br>
are not a good solution.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
