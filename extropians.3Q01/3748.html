&quot;Self-assembling&quot; solar cells developed 
<br>

<br>
Solar cells that &quot;self assemble&quot; from a liquid have been developed by 
<br>
scientists at the University of Cambridge. The breakthrough could make it 
<br>
cheap and easy to cover large areas, like roofs, with efficient, ultra-thin 
<br>
solar cell coatings.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is potentially very important,&quot; says Jenny Nelson, an expert in solar 
<br>
cells at Imperial College in London. &quot;If you've got something in solution, 
<br>
you could, in principle, put down very large areas of photo-voltaic material 
<br>
very cheaply.&quot;
<br>
<p>To make the solar cell solution, Lukas Schmidt-Mende and his colleagues at 
<br>
Cambridge took two chemicals called perylene and hexabenzocoronene (HBC) and 
<br>
dissolved them in chloroform. 
<br>
<p>They then poured some of the mixture onto a spinning glass sheet coated with 
<br>
an alloy electrode. As the chloroform evaporated, they found they were left 
<br>
with a thin layer of material, just one tenth of a micron thick. 
<br>
<p>When they examined the layer closely, they found that the perylene had risen 
<br>
to the top, while the HBC had crystallised out at the bottom. Inside the 
<br>
layer, though, needle-like crystals of perylene were mixed closely with 
<br>
disc-shaped HBC molecules.
<br>
<p><p>High efficiency 
<br>
<p><p>To test the material's efficiency as a solar cell, the scientists evaporated 
<br>
a thin coating of aluminium on top of the layer and measured the current 
<br>
between this and the lower alloy electrode while shining a light on it. 
<br>
&quot;Organic materials normally have low efficiencies, but we found we this was 
<br>
high - peaking at 34 per cent,&quot; says Schmidt-Mende. The efficiency is a 
<br>
measure of the amount of current produced for a certain illumination.
<br>
<p>The material works as a solar cell because as light photons hit the layer, 
<br>
they knock electrons out of molecules they collide with. Each collision 
<br>
leaves a hole which closely follows the ejected electron around the material 
<br>
over a short distance. 
<br>
<p>In most materials, the electron-hole pairs recombine quickly in a flash of 
<br>
light. But because perylene conducts electrons well, and HBC conducts holes 
<br>
well, the electron-hole pair is torn apart at the boundary of the two 
<br>
materials. This produces a flow of electrons to the top of the layer while 
<br>
holes flow to the bottom. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The good thing is that you can make really cheap devices like this,&quot; says 
<br>
Schmidt-Mende. He concedes, though, that to be contenders, they will have to 
<br>
improve the efficiency of the solar cells. To do that, they hope to orient 
<br>
the molecules in the layer to channel the charges more swiftly through the 
<br>
layer.
