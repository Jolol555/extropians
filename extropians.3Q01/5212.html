<p><em>&gt;I think that the labor movement occurred when it did because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of a lack of entrepreneurs and hence a labor over-supply.  Under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such conditions, laboring men in certain industries didn't want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to compete against each other and against all the other men in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the street who wanted their jobs---this would have caused wages
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to go lower.  So they banded together for collective bargaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which is all right (unless they then try to use force to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;owners from firing all of them, or use politics to keep owners
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from getting them to sign contracts, and use politics to keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those contracts from being legally enforced).
</em><br>
<p>The labor movement started when corporation formed monopsonys (one
<br>
buyer) and work conditions became so deplorable that the workers
<br>
developed monopolys (one seller) to counter them.
<br>
<p>The owners used politicians where possible, and private thugs (The
<br>
Pinkertons) whenever they couldn't buy a politician.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As painful as it would be to be at a market disadvantage (it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happens to employers too when they just can't get enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;qualified people and have to pay extortionate wages for them),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the proper view is to regard such periods as transitory:  as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;soon as the wages go very low, other entrepreneurs (including
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the working men themselves) would have sprung up to take 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advantage of the &quot;obscene&quot; profits.  That's how it is supposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to work.  Unions, unfortunately, only prolonged IMO the period 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;during which working men and women didn't earn very much.
</em><br>
<p>Every benefit modern workers enjoy was earned for them by Union
<br>
labor. 
<br>
<p>I sit here less than a block from the scene of the Haymarket square
<br>
riot where union organizers were framed then hung for the terrible
<br>
crime of trying to establish the 8 hour workday.
