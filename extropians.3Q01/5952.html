<p>Just different civil rights is all. You forgot that Castro is also in
<br>
the mix here, and that Ortega's popularity is due to the thousands of
<br>
people he gave land to that he stole from others.
<br>
<p>You have a point about this, though, but I worry about the idea of
<br>
allying with them. Castro and Ortega both gained power as leaders of
<br>
minor factions of broad revolutionary movements, who killed off and
<br>
imprisoned their rivals once the revolution was over. With people such
<br>
as this, the best thing to do is to off them first and coopt their
<br>
movements.
