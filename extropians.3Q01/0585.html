<p><em>&gt;It is rare to find people who have integrated (and I mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*integrated*) the scientific and 'spiritual' (ok, using quotes)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aspects of oneself because it's *hard*. Usually I've seen in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientists, who are also religious, some peculiar blinders set
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around their spriritual world. I'm not sure how integrated my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;process is, but it's been going on more than 10 years now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;re-working and refining and re-living. The only person who I know,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for sure, that has accomplished an integration of their spiritual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and scientific world is a very good friend, who is an atmospheric
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chemist, and a Zen Budhhist teacher, and she is currently advising
</em><br>
<em>&gt;congress-critters about environmental policy.
</em><br>
<p>Though more of a &quot;Zennist&quot; than a Buddhist I don't see the two as
<br>
separate at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think that a definition about 'spirituality' is highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individual because it _must_ emerge out of one's own inner
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explorations, and therefore it is almost impossible to separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the individual's belief/philosophical system and the individual's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;practices.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that it's individual, but I often see people's practices as
<br>
completely different from what they claim to believe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I believe that there is a deep wisdom in my environment, it only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;requires me to be aware of it, to look, to probe, to see, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand. It's like recognizing a god in ourselves and in every
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human and every thing, but without the concept of a supernatural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creator. In addition, the environment present around me is also a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;result of processes in the past, and there is a deep wisdom there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as well. My own peculiar bent on this 'recognition' results in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being in awe of all things *living*; for me it's the most divine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thing that I can think of, that is,  that I am alive and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other things are alive and this world and Universe exists. I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know what better word than 'awe', at the fact that we exist. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt;psychological effect of my awe, is that often the smallest, most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inconsequential things in my environment seem to me to be the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;profound: footsteps in sand, the smell of garlic and onion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hearing children laughing (or crying), and so on.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see any inherent wisdom, but I do see inherent order, and
<br>
I see wisdom and order as a result of various processes. I tend to
<br>
hold in awe all things, not merely the living.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A corollary to the above arises from my physics knowledge plus
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some very basic level of trust (and naivte): I am deeply connected
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to my environment. One can trace the physics, biology, etc. to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;show these relationships hold, but I'm convinced. The result of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that connectedness for me has a profound psychological effect too:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I can make it through rough times when I 'feel' my connectedness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My connectedness knowledge seeps in my morals and value system, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well. Usually that's good, but the result is that I'm highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sensitive, with almost no boundaries, so my personal struggles lie
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in that direction.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like &quot;right understanding&quot; and other elements of the
<br>
eightfold path. The Buddha did insist it would end suffering.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;From my spiritual view, I believe that the answers (to any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;questions that we have) are *in us* and *around us*. This is one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;place where cultural history and mythology can play an important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;role. Humans have experienced and worked out amazing things, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their intellectual and emotional paths are in front of us, if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*only pay attention*. I.e., The symbols are in front of us in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stories of the lives of our human ancestors, if we know how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;read and understand the systems and symbols and then know how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apply those systems and symbols to our own (present) lives.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I have yet to experience THE answer, but I do know experience
<br>
is the key. And I have experienced many lesser answers.
