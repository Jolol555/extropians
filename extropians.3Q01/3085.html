<p>There are several, which is really irrelevant (or should be, at least).
<br>
What I find interesting is that outside of one person who is black and
<br>
has a history of exhibiting hypersensitivity about the actual statistics
<br>
of blacks in US society, everyone else who is claiming my comment was
<br>
racist were individuals who have similar habits of vilifying people for
<br>
politically incorrect statements, and similarly ignored the rest of my
<br>
post which that comment was in, which, if taken in context, would have
<br>
illustrated that it was simply a rather critical opinion of the value of
<br>
40 acres and a mule in the market today, and quoting a punch line from a
<br>
skit by a popular black comedian used in a similar context.
