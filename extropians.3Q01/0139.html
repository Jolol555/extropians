The SF Chronicle really surprised me today.   After months of article after
<br>
article telling of how those evil rotten Texas robber barons had raped
<br>
poor taxifornia and stolen our money, they ran an article today saying
<br>
the only equipment taxifornians need to find the real villains would be
<br>
a mirror.  Yes, they actually admitted that the power crisis really was
<br>
our own fault.  Remarkable.  Just when I had nearly given up on this
<br>
medium.  I hope it drives home the point that *bad decisions have bad
<br>
consequences*.  If I were an Enron stockholder and the CEO had failed
<br>
to cash in on taxifornia's stupid rules that it made itself, I would vote to
<br>
throw the bum out and get someone who knows how to make money
<br>
when there is money to be made.
<br>
<p>Let us consider it a 9 billion dollar tuition bill.  spike
