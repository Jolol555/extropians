<em>&gt;&gt; Is anyone suggesting that we should never even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; question the idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; scientific paradigm shifts form a successive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; approximation to truth?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Question it all you want Tim... but if you expect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be taken seriously, you'd better have a pretty good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternate explanation with something that approaches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporting evidence.
</em><br>
<p>It's not actually necessary to be able to answer a question to demonstrate
<br>
that the existing answers are inadequate. In fact this is pretty key to
<br>
Kuhn's historical model, in which anomalies are noted well before new
<br>
theories explain them.
<br>
<p>For myself, my closest philosophical affiliation is to Pyrrhonism, also
<br>
known as classical skepticism. A recent essya on the subject may be found at
<br>
<a href="http://maroney.org/Essays/The_Freedom_of_Doubt.html">http://maroney.org/Essays/The_Freedom_of_Doubt.html</a> . There are serious
<br>
anomalies in the entire idea of &quot;truth,&quot; which I regard as a moral judgment.
<br>
<p>However, I do not disregard the idea of progress through science, only the
<br>
idea of progress towards the purely speculative idea of absolute truth. An
<br>
alternative model that seems to bear consideration is the evolutionary model
<br>
of &quot;anomalistic selection.&quot; (This idea will probably only be understandable
<br>
to those who have read Kuhn -- I'm not going to try to provide that
<br>
background here.) Just as species develop longer lives and greater
<br>
reproductive success by evolving to survive in an environment littered with
<br>
obstacles, so theories develop greater longevity and broader applicability
<br>
by surviving an onslaught of anomalies. This does not imply that there is
<br>
any theory which will never encounter any anomalies, which would be another
<br>
way of saying &quot;absolute truth.&quot; The model is a naturalistic view of the
<br>
development of theory which tries to deal with the fact that we seem to wind
<br>
up with better theories over time, without postulating unobservable
<br>
metaphysical ideals.
<br>
<p>Ob.transhuman: As we look towards increased intelligence, we should be
<br>
considering the cognitive modes such beings would exhibit. From my own
<br>
observations of where both science and philosophy are going, it seems to me
<br>
that we will be looking at less absolutist, less essentialist, more
<br>
multi-valued, more skeptical, more existentialist beings, who are
<br>
increasingly comfortable with ambiguity and increasingly unconvinced by
<br>
absolute and dogmatic assertion, who are thoroughly self-aware of their own
<br>
role in constructing reality by modeling it. They will be smarter than we
<br>
are, but they will also be, strangely, more tentative.
