<p>
I have to disagree with some of Christian's and Charlie's statements.
<br>
<p>For example, one reporter discussed today the response of Congress
<br>
to the 1983 bombing of the Capitol Building.  It was suggested that
<br>
you would have to prevent people from having access to the Capitol
<br>
to make it safe.  The response of the congressional leadership was
<br>
to determine that &quot;no&quot; you could not separate the symbols of freedom
<br>
from the people.  That would destroy what freedom was all about.
<br>
I think the same will occur here.
<br>
<p>Mario Cumo offered some interesting comments on this generating the
<br>
will to do some things that are easy and simple to do.  Why do
<br>
we allow knives up to 4 inches in carry-on luggage?  Is that really
<br>
a &quot;necessary&quot; freedom?  Is having my bags or luggage X-rayed and
<br>
sniffed a restriction of my freedom when I'm placing myself in a
<br>
situation where, whether I'm a crazy person or a terrorist, I could
<br>
use weapons or bombs to endanger others?  I'd say no -- that knowing
<br>
such security is in place should increase our confidence that we may
<br>
safely travel freely.  Is there a right to be free from extensive
<br>
security, background, and even drug checks for all individuals
<br>
related to airport and airline security and servicing?
<br>
I'd say no.  If you want that job, that goes with the territory.
<br>
(When this is all said and done, I suspect we will find there
<br>
may have been some fairly significant screw ups in this regard.)
<br>
<p>Would having computer systems that did automated matching of
<br>
airline passenger lists with FBI/CIA/NSA lists of suspicious
<br>
persons be a loss of freedom?  Would being required to have
<br>
forgery resistant &quot;air travel&quot; passports entail a loss of
<br>
freedom?  Only if you think one of your freedoms is the &quot;right&quot;
<br>
to diminish the rights that other passengers who seek a high
<br>
degree of confidence that you are a &quot;trustably&quot; safe passenger.
<br>
<p>I would doubt that the U.S. would ever manage to pass the
<br>
encryption restrictions that I believe the French and the
<br>
Russians have already passed (where the use of such methods is,
<br>
in theory, outlawed to at least some degree).  There is a
<br>
big difference between a desire for privacy and a situation
<br>
where you can get your hands on a weapon of mass destruction.
<br>
Would maintenance of government lists of people who use
<br>
encrypted communications be useful at increasing monitoring
<br>
of such individuals?  Should such people be subjected to
<br>
more stringent security measures at airports?  I think these
<br>
are reasonable things to consider.  You can have your privacy --
<br>
but the price you have to pay for it is increased scrutiny
<br>
when you are in situations where you may have access to WoMD.
<br>
<p>I think a sane analysis of the risks and benefits will prevail.
<br>
Do I think I'll ever again be able to arrive at an airport 15
<br>
minutes before the flight and still make the plane.  I suspect
<br>
probably not.  But that is the price I may simply have to pay
<br>
to have a relative degree of confidence that I will reach
<br>
my destination safely.
<br>
