Spudboy had commented on the efforts to re-write the genetic code.
<br>
<p>This is actually old news.  The first news item I've seen on it
<br>
seems to be on pg 12, April 8, 2000 New Scientist...  (How do
<br>
I know that just off the top of my head???)... Well it happens
<br>
to be a reference I looked up today for a paper I'm writing on
<br>
what the ability to rewrite the genetic code will mean for the
<br>
development of nanotechnology.
<br>
<p>Then Eliezer commented:
<br>
<em>&gt; Is it just me, or does this sound like a really bad idea?
</em><br>
<p>Its just you.  Its actually a good thing because if you can
<br>
completely rewrite the code and produce organisms based on it
<br>
you can eliminate one of the primary objections that the luddites
<br>
have to GMO -- namely the effect of cross-pollination eventually
<br>
forcing modified genes into &quot;natural&quot; species.  With a completely
<br>
novel code gene transfer cannot occur (its like trying to run
<br>
an IBM 370 machine language program on a VAX -- all you get is
<br>
garbage).
<br>
<p>Now of course, since my paper argues that this will enable a
<br>
clearer path to &quot;real&quot; nanotechnology *that* might worry *you*.  But
<br>
since I've taken a rough cut at actually putting costs on the development
<br>
of real nanoassemblers and they turn out to be pretty expensive
<br>
you don't have to run off screaming into the night just yet.
<br>
<p>When I've had the paper reviewed, the URL will be posted, so
<br>
hold your questions for now.
<br>
<p>Robert
