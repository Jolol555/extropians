<p>
Harvey does bring up some hard questions about how one deals
<br>
with either tired old arguments, or texts full of pseudo-science.
<br>
Two classic cases are the university mathematicians who would
<br>
each week receive a number of &quot;proofs&quot; of Fermat's Last Theorem,
<br>
and the barrage of pseudo-scientific papers written by Creation
<br>
Scientists purporting to disprove evolution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lately, we have been accused of having &quot;blind faith&quot; in science by not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally verifying scientific knowledge with our own research.  We have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been accused of being &quot;politically correct&quot; for not giving unscientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewpoints equal standing with scientific ones.  We have been accused of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;refusing to debate&quot; for not debunking every crank theory that gets posted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have been accused of &quot;not proving our position&quot; if we don't personally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disprove every anti-science post that appears.  We have been accused of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;appeal to authority&quot; for preferring scientist's conclusions to those of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mystics or politicians.  We have been accused of &quot;personal attacks&quot; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reviewing an author's background and methodology.
</em><br>
<p>If by &quot;we&quot; you mean the scientific community, that's perfectly true.
<br>
<p>Suppose on this list, however, someone posted a detailed argument that
<br>
the moon landing was a hoax, or that the Shroud of Turin was legitimate?
<br>
What, indeed, should our response be?  I might reply by saying that these
<br>
are very old arguments, hardly accepted by any of this list's regulars,
<br>
and that the posting party should take his or her essays elsewhere.  I
<br>
probably would also, perhaps nastily, condemn the posts as &quot;conspiracy
<br>
theories&quot; or &quot;pseudo-science&quot;.  Just as many others here, I would *not*
<br>
feel obligated to undertake a line-by-line refutation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How should we respond to challenges to science or established facts?  How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much work should we undertake to argue the basics over and over again?
</em><br>
<p>None!  But I do admire the good soldiers here who do undertake explaining
<br>
certain fundamentals, say about extropianism, to the newbies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (This used to be against the list rules in former years.)  How much time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should we expend defending our basic position that science is real and all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists aren't part of a great liberal conspiracy of political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correctness?  Do we really need to examine unscientific organizations and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; methods just in case they might have stumbled across some truth that science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missed?
</em><br>
<p>You are here inching up towards the position of being able to dismiss 
<br>
out of hand those political views held by perhaps half of the list's
<br>
regular posters?  It would be too easy to take arguments that one disagreed
<br>
with concerning race or history (e.g., when did liberalism arise in the U.S.),
<br>
and attempt to write them off as pseudo-science, or that there was no need
<br>
to address such obviously crank views.  As a general rule, I would say that
<br>
arguments should be evaluated on their own merits (rather than being dismissed
<br>
out of hand) if quite a number of a list's regular participants find the
<br>
material suitable for discussion).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have tried to respond rationally and scientifically to some of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims lately.  I am becoming discouraged that it is a waste of time and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leads nowhere.  If people do not understand the basic scientific,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experimental, and statistical methods, then further discussion rarely helps.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If people do not believe in these methods, the situation is even worse.
</em><br>
<p>I have an idea that Harvey here could be referring to the views of Mike 
<br>
Lorrey and myself.  At one point, Harvey was claiming that Mike was very
<br>
ignorant of statistics and statistical methods or thinking.  This was
<br>
untrue and unfair:  the actual disagreement was just a misunderstanding,
<br>
and was quickly resolved to both parties' satisfaction.  And to be honest,
<br>
Harvey, I really haven't seen you beleaguered by people who were not
<br>
&quot;rational and scientific&quot;, at least not lately.  Surely I've misunderstood;
<br>
you didn't really mean us, did you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Time is a limiting factor here.  It is no wonder that most readers just skip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these arguments.  Should we just ignore these challenges as they appear?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does that make them appear stronger or weaker than directly confronting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them?  Is there a danger of filling the Extropian archives with all sorts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unscientific conspiracy theories that are posted as if they had all our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would seriously love to hear some comment about this.
</em><br>
<p>Okay :-)  I'm giving it my best shot.  I don't see any easy answer.  Sometimes
<br>
I skip replying to posts simply because I agree with them.  If the poster already
<br>
has high status on the list, then he or she should interpret my silence that way.
<br>
As for other threads, I ignore them entirely if I am not interested in them.  So
<br>
I don't quite think that the danger warrants much worry:  sure, crank letters
<br>
will appear in the archives that no one responded to, but sensible people aren't
<br>
going to suppose that those views are widely endorsed.
