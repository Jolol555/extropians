This is very interesting research alright and it will help a lot of
<br>
patients. But our interest in AI should cause us to differentiate between
<br>
afferent and efferent information flow. The work you describe below is all
<br>
efferent flow and that has been demonstrated before at several
<br>
centres. Patients are taught for example to move cursors on a computer by
<br>
will power. Warwick's imminent experiment will be the first to try out a
<br>
major afferent flow of information. Do you acquire instant encyclopedic
<br>
knowledge when an encyclopedia on a chip is implanted? That is what
<br>
Warwick will find out.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's at <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.02/warwick.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.02/warwick.html</a>.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Coincidentally I received the August issue of Wired today and it describes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research next to which Warwick's little arm chip is little more than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sideshow stunt.  The article, by wheelchair-bound John Hockenberry, tells
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about work to expand the capabilities of the disabled via mind-machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interface:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;When you meet Johnny Ray, it's a challenge to see the former drywall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contractor and amateur musician trapped inside his body, but he's there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ray, a 63-year-old from Carrollton, Georgia, suffered a brain-stem stroke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in 1997, which produced what doctors call &quot;locked-in syndrome&quot;: He has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtually no moving parts.  Cognitively he's intact, but he can't make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a motion to deliver that message or any other to the world.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;[Dr. Roy] Bakay... wouldn't describe anything he does as show business,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but to me the results of his work sound like a real-world version of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nifty plug Neo/Keanu sported in The Matrix.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;'We simply make a hole in the skull right above the ear, near the back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end of the motor cortex, secure our electrodes and other hardware to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bone so they don't migrate, and wait for a signal,' Bakay says.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The implant is an intriguing hybrid of electronics and biology - it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physically melds with brain tissue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;'We use a small piece of glass shaped like two narrow cones into which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a gold electrical contact has been glued,' Bakay says.  'The space in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cones is filled with a special tissue culture, and the whole thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is placed inside the motor cortex.'  The tissue culture is designed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'attract' brain cells to grow toward the contact.  When brain cells meet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gold, the electrical activity of individual cells is detectable across
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the electrode.  Gold wires carry signals back out of the skull, where they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are amplified.  This produces a far more sensitive and usable signal than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you get from surface technology like the taped-on electrodes used in EEGs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;To get a broad sense of what the patient's brain is doing, neurologists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perform magnetic resonance imaging and compare changes in the motor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cortext with voltages monitored through the electrodes.  Then the doctors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get really clever.  The patient is encouraged to think simple thoughts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that correspond to distinct conditions and movements, like hot/cold or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up/down.  Gradually, the doctors extract and codify electrical patterns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that change as a patient's thoughts change.  If a patient can reproduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and trigger the signal using the same thought patterns, that signal can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be identified and used to control, say, a cursor on a computer screen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The technique is very crude, but what Bakay and his colleagues have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrated is a truly alternative brain-body interface pattern.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At first Ray has to imagine arm motions to trigger the cursor, but over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time his brain adapts:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;As the brain cells in and around Ray's implant did what he asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to do, the imagined sensation of moving his body parts gradually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disappeared altogether.  One day when his skill at moving the cursor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seemed particularly adept, the doctors asked Ray what he was feeling.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Slowly, he typed, 'nothing.'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Ray was interacting directly with the cursor similar to how he might once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have interacted with his hand.  'People don't think &quot;move hand&quot; to move
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their hands unless they are small children just learning,' Bakay explains.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'Eventually the brain just eliminates these intermediate steps until the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand feels like a part of the brain.'  The description reminds me of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've heard Isaac Stern describe his violin as an extension of his body.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think of my wheelchair the same way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The fact that Ray's cursor is indistinguishable from almost any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prosthesis raises an important philosophical question: Because of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implant, is a Dell Pentium cursor now more a part of Johnny Ray than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of his own paralyzed arms?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These people are the real cyborgs, with actual brain implants interfacing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to their nervous system, allowing them to control the world around them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in new ways.
</em><br>
