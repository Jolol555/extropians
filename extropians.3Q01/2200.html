<em>&gt;Carlos, comparing their share of the whole is not meaningful. First, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need to state what the cost of living was and now is, then compare the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change in the mean for the lowest 20% against that versus the richest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;20%.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I guess you're right there. As I can't come up with the actual
<br>
figures and studies (short of flying back to Argentina and spending a
<br>
month tracing things through printed archives of old publications I read
<br>
a few years ago), please feel free to dismiss anything that follows
<br>
as it relies only on my memory of readings and listening to people.
<br>
I think the cost of living increased around 15% during the Menem
<br>
administration. I think the Inquiry cited by Tedesco's paper is using
<br>
&quot;variation of power of acquisition of income, after cost of living
<br>
increases are accounted for&quot;. That is, for the lower classes income
<br>
seem to have raised a bit, but less than the cost of living. While
<br>
for the upper classes their income seems to have raised above
<br>
the cost of living increases. I can't ask you to accept all this on
<br>
faith of course, just mentioning it here so you can see why I'm
<br>
inclined to think there seems to have been an increase in inequalities.
<br>
I'm no expert, so perhaps I'm interpreting the figures wrong...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Tax havens become attractive when local taxation is seen as overly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;punitive.
</em><br>
<p>Of course it is punitive. And it is going to get worse. The government
<br>
is aiming for a zero-deficit policy from now on, which means anything
<br>
that tax collections don't suffice to pay, will not be paid. I expect
<br>
a lot of pressure will be put on bussinesses to come up with money
<br>
to avoid a closure of state services, particularly in education and health.
<br>
There is already discussions on parliament on very harsh laws to punish
<br>
tax evasion and such.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Have you got any pointers to data stating that the poor got poorer during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Menem era?
</em><br>
<p>Same caveat as before applies, I guess. The only electronically available
<br>
material I can point to is Tedesco's paper: 'La nata contra el vidrio: urban
<br>
violence and democratic governability in Argentina', Bulletin of Latin
<br>
American Research 19 (2000), 527-545, Elsevier Science Ltd. She cites
<br>
figures from INDEC's statistics (which are not electronically available,
<br>
as is the case with most studies on socioeconomic change, what a pain).
<br>
She also cites some working papers from UNICEF and private studies,
<br>
again nothing electronically available.
<br>
<p>I just stumbled across CEPAL's documents on the web. They seem to indicate
<br>
that during Menem's first administration poverty reduced a good deal, but
<br>
at the end of his second administration poverty levels seem to be the
<br>
same as before his rise to government. Intresting, I think, and something
<br>
I wasn't much aware of (though I recall people saying something like that
<br>
was happening). The link to the 'Panorama Social de America Latina' is:
<br>
<a href="http://www.eclac.cl/publicaciones/SecretariaEjecutiva/8/lcg2068/contenido.htm">http://www.eclac.cl/publicaciones/SecretariaEjecutiva/8/lcg2068/contenido.htm</a>
<br>
(I'm afraid it seems to be only in Spanish, sorry).
<br>
<p>There is also a very nice CEPAL publication with Argentina's general economy
<br>
indicators, showing the development of the last 10 years. Again, I'm no
<br>
expert, but a good amount of the figures look quite appalling to me.

<br>
(again, it is in Spanish, sorry!)
