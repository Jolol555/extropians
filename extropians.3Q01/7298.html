<em>&gt; &gt; TEN PROPOSED NEW LAWS FOR THIS CRISIS:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My wife and I loved this.  Yes, there are many people who claim to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;patriotic&quot; who never bothered to vote or attend any meetings to try to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good government.  We have always said &quot;If you didn't vote in the election,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can't complain about a candidate or a law put in place by the election&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you choose to vote &quot;I don't care&quot;, then how can you say it went against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your wishes?
</em><br>
<p>&lt;shrugs&gt;  I voted in every single election in my county since I was of
<br>
legal age to do so.  In the '00 elections, my choice for President did
<br>
not make the top three (counting by popular votes).  And yet, my
<br>
protests when the government proposes and passes laws that, in my
<br>
opinion, are at best an insult to the Constitution and the spirit in
<br>
which it was written, are utterly ignored by those with any power to
<br>
significantly affect the laws.  Instead, these people choose to listen
<br>
to those who vote with their money (for example: see the recent
<br>
Slashdot article on the money trail leading to the SSSCA that's as good
<br>
an example of &quot;bought legislation&quot; as has been exposed recently),
<br>
ensuring that said donors will have more money to buy more legislation.
<br>
<p>Given that, does it really matter whether one votes or not?  I plan to
<br>
keep doing so, since it costs me nothing (yet) and might possibly
<br>
affect some very local issues.  But what of those where even the local
<br>
politicians are openly for sale?
<br>
<p>This type of situation is what bred the worst failures of communistic
<br>
and socialistic impluses.  I wonder, though, if there is any system of
<br>
government of human beings (not &quot;perfect&quot; but currently hypothetical
<br>
AIs) that can resist such corruption while staying away from
<br>
(inevitably broken/corrupt in practice) strong central governments.
<br>
Perhaps one that naturally gravitates towards a distributed government,
<br>
not a central government, over time, while still keeping enough
<br>
effective central government or government/government interaction to
<br>
have any meaning (which disqualifies systems like privately produced
<br>
law, since the practitioners there are, in practice, free to ignore one
<br>
another's laws).
