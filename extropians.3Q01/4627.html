<p>I agree. here is a hopefully educational anecdote:
<br>
<p>When I attended the World Future Society meeting in Washington a few
<br>
years back, I listened to Walter Kistler (of Kistler Aerospace and
<br>
Foundation for the Future) held a talk named &quot;Reprogenics and the future
<br>
of reproduction&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Among the first things he mentioned was eugenics and how modern genetics
<br>
could make embryo selection possible. He also mentioned dysgenics, the
<br>
worry that since our medicine saves many people who would otherwise have
<br>
died the incidence of bad genes in the gene pool would increase.
<br>
<p>At that point nearly a third of the audience left.
<br>
<p>I think I can see how they saw it: an old man, with a german-sounding
<br>
name talking about eugenics and dysgenics calmly and without immediately
<br>
denouncing the concept. Clearly he must be an evil nazi! So they left.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile the talk moved on, and while I think he severely overstated
<br>
the problem of dysgenics he eventually reached a very liberal
<br>
conclusion: to make best use of the genetic technologies we have or will
<br>
be having, we should leave the choice to parents. Since they will be
<br>
interested in the wellfare of their children they will - by themselves,
<br>
for their own reasons and with no need for central coordination - help
<br>
keep the gene pool healthy. Kistler made a good argument more people
<br>
should hear, but because he alienated so many in the audience from the
<br>
start by using the term eugenics his argument was not heard.
