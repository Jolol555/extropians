</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the clarification. I finally understand what you were trying
<br>
to say. Now I suggest that you *carefully* re-read Olga's post. She did
<br>
(for the record, in caps) NOT say  that people were in any way &quot;unaware
<br>
of slavery.&quot; She was obviously referring to the fact that few people
<br>
were aware of the fact that slaves built the White House. Why would she
<br>
say that few people were aware of slavery? The obvious point was that
<br>
slaves' contributions were unappreciated. Hence your response was (to
<br>
me, obviously) unclear and confusing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And, poor me, I tried to be as inoffensive to all parties on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list as I could be, without provoking a general rehash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;the causes of the civil war&quot; when I wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; It's usually put forth as the reason that the Civil War
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; was fought, &quot;to free the slaves&quot;.  Abraham Lincoln is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; probably best known &quot;for freeing the slaves.&quot;  Okay :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; maybe you didn't hear this growing up because you weren't here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>By using phrases like &quot;to free the slaves&quot; in quotes, your response
<br>
might reasonably be interpreted as suggesting some doubt or disavowal of
<br>
that statement on your part. If that isn't the case, then I am
<br>
gratified. But coming on the heals of your apparent assertion that Olga
<br>
had claimed people to be &quot;unaware&quot; of slavery, I admit I was ready to
<br>
believe the worst.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I don't blame you so much (only a little) for finding that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confusing.  You weren't aware that I was talking about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state of &quot;everyone's&quot; beliefs, not about what was true.  As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it happens, I agree with you that slavery was the root cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the civil war, the fundamental cause, and the main cause.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (There were also other causes.)  Happy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, extremely. In fact I'm dancing with glee as I type.

<em>&gt; P.S.  I can see why most of the time you only lurk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
Yup, me too. Heck, most of the time I don't even read half this stuff.
