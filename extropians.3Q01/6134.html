</em><br>
<p>Actually, all it requires is four pilots, 4-8 generic AK-wielding
<br>
terrorists, and one, count-em: ONE security rent-a-cop who is actually a
<br>
mole. 12-13 people, tops. Skilled people, no doubt, but being a third
<br>
world citizen doesn't mean you are still banging rocks together. There
<br>
are plenty of trained airline pilots in muslim nations.
<br>
<p>Intelligence people say that they knew that bin laden was training
<br>
pilots to suicide crash airliners with simulators.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also as I said, 4 airliners not on flight plan? And no red flags are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off. If nothing else there should be a scramble to find and track the planes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for their own protection in case some weird error is happening in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations flight control system.
</em><br>
<p>Our internal NORAD interceptor forces were disbanded in the late 1980's.
<br>
The F-15 squadron I was in outside Seattle in 1988-90 was one of the
<br>
last, and it was deactivated in January of 1990. Air traffic controllers
<br>
likely saw them go off course, and knew that their lack of response was
<br>
telling, but they had ABSOLUTELY nobody to tell to take action against
<br>
the planes.
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that using airliners as lawn darts has NEVER been used as a
<br>
terrorist tactic (unless you count that Egyptair crash a few years ago).
<br>
The worst we would expect was hijacking followed by hostage taking and
<br>
negotiation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And all of this in a situation where individuals have allowed government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intrusion into their lives, accept four hour check in times, etc just so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this would not happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To me that is incompetency beyond belief.
</em><br>
<p>When your airline is responsible for its own security, and farms that
<br>
out to minimum wage rentacops, that is a recipe for disaster.
