<p>&quot;Dead certain&quot;?  Obviously, I have to be much less certain
<br>
that there is something wrong with how they think, than I
<br>
am that what they think is wrong.  Suppose that someone
<br>
adamantly believes that NASA's people walking on the moon
<br>
was a hoax.  I'm 99.9% convinced that they're wrong.  I'm
<br>
only about 80% convinced that there is something wrong with
<br>
*how* they think.  But what else am I supposed to think?
<br>
<p>Suppose that I have a computer program that gives what I
<br>
think is a 99.9% chance of being a wrong answer.  I simply
<br>
MUST entertain the hypothesis that there is something wrong
<br>
with the program.
<br>
<p>There comes a point in disagreeing with people who seem
<br>
reality challenged that one cannot be blamed for inquiring
<br>
as to why they are so bad at understanding the world.
<br>
<p>&quot;Most dogmatic and intolerant opinions&quot; you've ever seen?
<br>
I think that you are exaggerating.
