<p>
Thanks to Damien for posting some URLs to look at about the
<br>
question of how a Guaranteed Income would work out.  (I know
<br>
that many here reject the whole idea on principle; me too,
<br>
except that (1) who knows what will happen if maturn MNT
<br>
comes a while before the Singularity?, (2) if rolling back
<br>
the level of government confiscation isn't going to happen,
<br>
should a Negative Income Tax be suggested instead to replace
<br>
the massive government bureaucracies of HEW here in the U.S.?,
<br>
and (3) I find the econonomics of it interesting anyway.)
<br>
<p>I suppose that I need to consult St. Google for some American
<br>
examples (Damien's appear to be mostly about proposals and
<br>
analyses concerning the Australian or European situations).
<br>
I was struck by the following passage, however, in one of
<br>
those URLS.  Foreign readers probably will want to skip this,
<br>
but American's might be amused as to how some of the European's
<br>
view their own problems (highly different from ours, e.g., in
<br>
the light of having much better educated peoples).
<br>
<p>03mar98: Wim van Velzen: Europe lacks jobs not skills
<br>
<p>Unemployment in Europe: Can Things Only Get Better?
<br>
<p>In the European Union 18 million people are officially registered unemployed, i.e., 12% of
<br>
the active population. Half of them have been out of work for more than a year. More than
<br>
one fifth of all young people are without a paid job. Between 25 and 30 million people in
<br>
Europe are looking for work. Critics of the European social model are not getting tired of
<br>
pointing out, how much better the United States are doing in creating net employment. What
<br>
they seem to forget is that millions of employed Americans live in poverty without a
<br>
decent social safety net and health insurance and that the inequality in American society
<br>
is growing. This is not the way Europe should polish up its unemployment statistics: we do
<br>
not have the political ambition of creating a social class of the &quot;working poor&quot;.
<br>
Furthermore, the European Treaty obliges us to strive for social cohesion.
<br>
<p>In the Thatcher era, the UK government had firmly set course for the American model. The
<br>
new Labour government seems to want to find a &quot;third way&quot; between the American and the
<br>
European, i.e., Continental, model. Coming from the good old continent, I want to come to
<br>
the defence of the solidarity-based European social model. I think it is worthwhile
<br>
defending: it has done well, it is doing well and there is no reason to dismiss it.
<br>
However, it has to undergo certain changes. That is normal. Systems have to be dynamic,
<br>
they have to be able to react to economic, social and societal changes.
<br>
<p>It is true that our employment rate (60.4%)  [not a misprint? 40 percent unemployment?]
<br>
is low compared to the USA and Japan where it exceeds 74%. So, what can we do to exploit
<br>
the huge labour reserve we have in Europe? According to the recent Commission document
<br>
&quot;Growth and Employment in The Stability-Oriented Framework of EMU&quot; two conditions must be
<br>
met: firstly, the existing workforce must be &quot;employable&quot; and, secondly, the economy must
<br>
create the necessary working posts.
<br>
<p>For quite a while European institutions and national governments have presented training
<br>
as a miracle cure against unemployment. It is, therefore, nothing less than astonishing
<br>
that in this recent document the European Commission changes its tune. Where in earlier
<br>
documents the lack of skills of the European workforce was blamed for high unemployment,
<br>
it is now strongly pointed out that actually skill-wise our workforce is not doing so
<br>
badly after all, and that the economy must create the necessary working posts in the first
<br>
place:
<br>
<p>&quot;...from the present 10.7 per cent of the labour force which is unemployed, about 6 per
<br>
cent could re-enter the job market fairly fast if and when jobs are offered to them. Thus,
<br>
despite some bottlenecks in a few specific sectors, there is no evidence that the skills
<br>
offered by a sizable share of the workforce are basically outdated or insufficient to
<br>
ensure employability the true immediate bottleneck is located at the level of net job
<br>
creation in the economy.&quot;
<br>
<p>This only underlines what the European Parliament has been pointing out for years: that
<br>
training people without being able to offer them jobs is pointless. For years European
<br>
citizens have been trained and retrained several times in a row with money from the
<br>
Structural Funds without ever finding sustainable employment.
<br>
<p>(taken from <a href="http://www.faxfn.org/">http://www.faxfn.org/</a>).
<br>
<p>Maybe some European countries with their &quot;safety nets&quot; already
<br>
have the equivalent of a GI?   Or... they lack jobs and we lack
<br>
skills?  Sounds like a deal in the making.  I guess that they
<br>
should all just come over here, where there is a shortage of
<br>
people with skills.   I'll have to go re-read some Julian Simon
<br>
and see what he thinks about the idea of the U.S. population
<br>
approaching six billion.
