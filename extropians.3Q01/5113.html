<p><em>&gt; Why is it that international drug cartels don't ship their product

</em><br>
<p>Because they make many shipments, each typically many tons. It is
<br>
uneconomical, and because there would be so many drug parcels in transit
<br>
people would start screening for them. No one expects nukes in UPS parcels
<br>
so far. Actually, if I was to smuggle a set of nukes into a country, and
<br>
had not underground network of fanatics, I'd try to make contacts to the
<br>
drug cartels. Because they do it professionally, and successfully.
<br>
Assuming, they're willing to do it (unlikely, though), the probability of
<br>
detection would be very low.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I tend to agree with you on this. Of course the first successful
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's last since undoubtably the retaliation will mean complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elimination of said group.
</em><br>
<p>I don't care about the group (assuming, they're nice enough to advertize
<br>
their name and their location), and the group doesn't care about being
<br>
rational, otherwise it wouldn't do something as foolish. I care about the
<br>
people nuked.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Getting an airborne form of anthrax is not easy, the Japanese cult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aum Shinrikyo despite being technically very sophisticated failed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in it's attempts. Good luck playing with VX.
</em><br>
<p>Aum S. were amateurs. The preparation (rather weak agent as a rather
<br>
dilute acetonitrile solution) and the mode of deployment (slowly leaking
<br>
plastic baggie) indicate that they had really no clue. Which is a good
<br>
thing. However, gambling on continuation of your lucky streak is not good
<br>
statistics.
<br>
<p>They could have achieved two orders of magnitude more victims merely by a
<br>
different mode of deployment, by aerosoling the the solution with a
<br>
low-temp pyrocharge. Many highschool students will arrive at this
<br>
conclusion without prompting. By synchronous deployment in strategic
<br>
locations they would have trapped the people underground. In this case,
<br>
very few people would have made it out there alive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Terrorists no, rogue nations yes.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm not willing the take the risk rogue nations are that stupid.
<br>
Besides, I'm not sure it makes sense to differentiate rogue nations from
<br>
terrorists, because a dictator has far too much to lose than an anonymous
<br>
group that is not in control.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have stated a number of times that the system we were discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was not designed for either superpowers nor terrorists, but rogue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations.
</em><br>
<p>Very well, I've stated a number of times that the umbrella will cause
<br>
other superpowers to increase their arsenal, and modify that arsenal,
<br>
resulting in more more difficult to intercept nukes. This is not a neutral
<br>
side effect, and needs to be taken into the calculation. Even if you're
<br>
not directly protecting yourself against other superpowers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again the system is not designed to thwart terrorists, except those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that head a rogue nation. Whether or not we successfully identify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the terrorists in you theoretical attack would remain to be seen.
</em><br>
<p>I very much hope that my attack will remain theoretical. And you seem not
<br>
to understand that you're thinking rationally, but no rational person will
<br>
nuke you. These is not the folks you have to be wary of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You couldn't even begin to successfully alert a population in 18
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minutes, much less get them to move anywhere unless they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely prepared.
</em><br>
<p>Technically, in the year 2001 you can alert the entire population in
<br>
seconds, on a rather modest budget. For starters, a cellphone with added
<br>
functionality and NEMP/jam detector will do. Training is another issue,
<br>
which, I believe, I already mentioned.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;So, how many shelters can you build for 300 gigabucks, or so?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not enough by far.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that's what goobvarmint is for, to create regulations that every new
<br>
built house needs to have a shelter of an approved design. These are
<br>
incremental costs, and as a side effect you get shelters with very short
<br>
average distances, so that you can react within a few minutes forewarning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There you go, your attack by your terrorists, using your scenario
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't even worth building a defense against.
</em><br>
<p>Um, you have a singularly selective perception.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My mistake, when I think of ICBM I think fusion not fission, so we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't even need to build bunkers.
</em><br>
<p>Small portable devices will be weak, dirty fission, maybe boosted fission.
<br>
State of the art nuclear devices should not be on the free market. Rogue
<br>
states don't do fusion, for the same reason they don't do ICBMs. Good
<br>
physicists and technicians are a lot scarcer and much less expendable than
<br>
fanatics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A smart terrorist would place his bomb in the largest shelter he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could find.
</em><br>
<p>Since shelters are distributed (well, they have be, because otherwise the
<br>
mean average distance would be too long), and he would have to detonate
<br>
his weak nuke underground, the amounts of survivors would be maximum in
<br>
this case. If you have limited resources, you go for an airburst, which
<br>
will profit from the nuke being dirty, if not salted. Much nastier than a
<br>
high flux, which they won't get, anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But this is again besides the point, the system we were discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was to defend against a limited number of rogue state launched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ICBM's not a terrorist attack. This does not make it useless.
</em><br>
<p>If you say so.
