<p><em>&gt; If you see the economy as an ecosystem, then government interference in it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is like strip mining.  Why would you not, also, see the government as a
</em><br>
<p>Good analogy. In fact, big government may be the manifestation of the
<br>
same fatal flaw, that inability to let things just sort themselves
<br>
out, that causes us to also f*ck up the environment and then pour
<br>
money into 'preserving' it. I wonder if the ecotopia built by
<br>
governments would be as absurd as the economies they've tried to
<br>
build.
<br>
<p>I agree that the medical industry would be better off with less
<br>
regulation, but there must be an open, public accreditation standard
<br>
that is controlled by the consumers-- a combination of standardized
<br>
exams for practitioners and summaries of what has been observed about
<br>
the effects of every existing drug and intervention in a language
<br>
readable by the lay public. This can be a private effort, and a
<br>
money-making one at that, in the same way that Consumer Reports makes
<br>
money and ePinions hopes to someday make money. One doesn't even need
<br>
to wait for the government to get out of the way for such an
<br>
independent accreditation and information entity to exist. In fact,
<br>
there are probably a number of publishing companies already positioned
<br>
to do this, and just haven't yet got the clue that there's a potential
<br>
niche for them in disintermediating the existing medical hegemony
<br>
(maybe when they notice that profits from static content aren't adding
<br>
up as quickly as they used to...).
<br>
<p>So, I'm hereby (re)injecting this idea into the memespace hoping
<br>
somebody picks it up and runs with it (it's hard to prove anything,
<br>
but it appears that this does happen on this list now and then).
