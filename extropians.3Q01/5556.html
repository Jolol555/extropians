<em>&gt; &gt; U.S. workers have increased their substantial lead over Japan and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;all other industrial nations in the number of hours worked each year,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;according to a report issued yesterday by the International Labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Organization. It found that Americans added nearly a full week to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;work year during the 1990s. They worked 1,979 hours on average last year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;-- that's 49 1/2 weeks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's 137 more hours or 3 1/2 weeks more per year than Japanese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;workers, 260 hours (about 6 1/2 weeks) more per year than British
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;workers and 499 hours (12 1/2 weeks) more per year than German workers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the report said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deeply questionable figures. Let's take 50 working weeks in the year,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 5 days per week; we get 250 working days. 1979 hours a year then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gives us an average 7.9 hours per working day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now let's look at the UK figures. 1979 - 260 = 1719. 1719/250 = 6.87
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working hours per day, or (6.87 x 5) an average 34.4 hour working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; week.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huh?
</em><br>
<p>You are forgetting about vacation time. How many weeks a year of
<br>
vacation do Britons take?
<br>
<p>If Brits take four weeks of vacation a year, that means the average work
<br>
week is 35.8 hours. If you blokes take six weeks of vacation a year,
<br>
that means you average 37.4 hours a week.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Official figures in the UK suggest the average working week has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creeping up, to more like 45 hours. (We keep getting bombarded with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earnest op-ed news features about it, along with hand-wringing about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workplace stress and the way people make more errors when they work more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than 44 hours a week.)
</em><br>
<p>This is the average of full time workers, not including part timers. If
<br>
you did, and had a 45 hour average, this means you have as many people
<br>
as the part timers working 70+hours a week.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So either the British are deeply, pathologically, ill -- taking 25% of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their worktime off sick -- or these figures are Just Plain Wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, now thats another interesting take. How many sick days a year do you
<br>
get over there? Since its a fact that people with cheaper health care
<br>
will use it far more frequently (irrespective of whether they get sick
<br>
more often), I'd expect that Brits take at least a few more sick days a
<br>
year than Americans.
