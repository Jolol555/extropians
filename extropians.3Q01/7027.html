<p>
Someone really needs to gather together the best posts ExI listmembers have
<br>
written regarding this crisis, and send them to President Bush.  Or perhaps
<br>
the very best points we came up with can be boiled down to one not too long
<br>
paper for him.  I'm not sure his advisors will be half as insightful as the
<br>
people around here.
<br>
<p>I suppose I should take upon myself this very important matter.  I just
<br>
worry my email will be lost among all the others sent to the Whitehouse
<br>
website.  Should I start with my local congressman and senator first, in the
<br>
hope they will pass it along?
<br>
<p>Robert Bradbury sure gave us some food for thought with his genocide
<br>
scenario.  It might feel really cathartic to do, but it would be like
<br>
fighting a B movie monster where the army drops bombs on it, only to find
<br>
the monster has split into many creatures, and is now infinitely more
<br>
powerful.  Not too mention how the neighboring nations would really resent
<br>
the much higher cancer rates they would then have to deal with.
<br>
<p>My friend George Smith on cryonet REALLY does want a nuclear strike on
<br>
Afghanistan.  He believes it would show we mean business.  But, being the
<br>
sensible fellow he is, George only would go for a tactical nuke being used
<br>
at this point.  And the avalanche of criticism he has gotten does not sway
<br>
him one bit.
<br>
<p>I suspect the president may like Eliezer's hypothetical ground invasion, but
<br>
I doubt Colin Powell will... lol  Experienced soldiers for some odd reason
<br>
are not so keen on loosing the dogs of war(and the whole damn kennel for
<br>
this one) unless absolutely necessary.
<br>
<p>I am sure glad Anders, Eliezer and Harvey among others are here on the list
<br>
as voices of reason and compassion.  I do realize though Robert was simply
<br>
playing, &quot;Devil's Advocate.&quot;  If I had a sister I would be proud to see her
<br>
date any of them. : )
<br>
<p>Good ideas have been brought up on the list, but I know even without us the
<br>
president will get to see many options requiring various levels of cost in
<br>
terms of money, time and sadly also freedom.  I hope Bush is smarter then he
<br>
looks.  Maybe on second thought I will send him our ideas...
<br>
<p>My own idea is to assemble a crack covert operations team made up of  Arnold
<br>
Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis, Steven
<br>
Segall, Lorenzo Lamas, David Dudikoff, Wesley Snipes, Dolph Lundgren and
<br>
Woody Allen!
<br>
<p>Of course they are not real soldiers, but it won't matter.  My hope is
<br>
Taliban soldiers will have been exposed to at least some American action
<br>
films before things got so strict.  And even a militant Taliban guy I bet
<br>
secretly has a love for movies with lots of shooting and explosions!
<br>
<p>When the Afghan troops see these American icons coming their way they will
<br>
freeze in terror,  run away totally demoralized, or beg for their pictures
<br>
to be taken with the stars!  Reality and fantasy will merge in their minds
<br>
as they remember how in 'Commando' Arnold killed so many bad guys he began
<br>
to look really bored!
<br>
<p>At some point poor Woody Allen will be captured!  He will be taken to a
<br>
fortress high in the mountains where the evil leaders are all hiding out.
<br>
Woody will continue to defy them with snide comments said quietly behind
<br>
their backs...
<br>
<p>This occurrence will enrage the Hollywood commandos.  They will storm the
<br>
place and kill everyone in sight to save their pal.  Woody will ask if they
<br>
could have maybe used just a little less violence to rescue him, as he
<br>
worries the blood stains on his new outfit may never come out.
<br>
<p>The people of Afghanistan will cheer the movie stars and crown Arnold
<br>
Schwarzenegger their king.  Arnold will finally get to have the harem he has
<br>
always wanted, but Maria wouldn't let him to have.
<br>
<p>It will turn out later in the media that in fact EVERYONE in the Hollywood
<br>
commandos(including Woody Allen) was a navy seal at one time, with the
<br>
exception of Steven Segall.  ; )
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
<br>
