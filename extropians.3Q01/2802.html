<em>&gt;&gt;  They also claim that producers who signed long-term contracts at low

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; actually signed such contracts have done.  The claim that a significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fraction would go bankrupt seems to reflect an unusual pessimism about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the reasonableness of the relevant bankruptcy laws, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How so?  They said it happened before in the 80s.  I don't know the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history, myself.  What do you think bankruptcy laws could do?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Bad bankruptcy laws can make it sufficiently easy to renege on contracts
<br>
that contracts are useless. With the best bankruptcy laws, bankruptcy
<br>
would be painfull enough that most companies will avoid it. The actual
<br>
bankruptcy laws are somewhere in between those extremes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Early in the paper, they were clear that 98 and 99 were fairly normal. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I interpreted the later references to three years of drought to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relative to the heavy rain years before.  Normal weather in California
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is pretty dry, and not enough to refill all the reservoirs.  The normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rainfall in 98 and 99 led to less-full reservoirs, and no cushion when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the rainfall was even lower in 2000.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Your version is even farther from the truth than theirs. 98 was one
<br>
of the wettest years on record. California reservoirs were essentially
<br>
full at the end of the spring runnoffs in 98, 99, and 2000 (I think in 2000
<br>
some reservoirs in states further north were hurt by a dry year). The
<br>
current low reservoir levels in California are entirely due to this year
<br>
being dry and to the higher than normal use of water for power in the second
<br>
half of 2000. Anyone who wants to wade through lots of actual data can follow
<br>
the links from <a href="http://cdec.water.ca.gov/misc/monthly_res.html">http://cdec.water.ca.gov/misc/monthly_res.html</a> and
<br>
<a href="http://cdec.water.ca.gov/misc/resinfo.html">http://cdec.water.ca.gov/misc/resinfo.html</a>  (I pay close attention to this
<br>
because of its effects on when and where I kayak).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think we're arguing about minor issues.  Do you think other policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decisions than the price caps were foreseeable, or had a major impact on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the actual shape of the crisis?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Our disagreements about what happened are probably minor.
<br>
&nbsp;I think the effects of spot market pricing instead of pricing via long-term
<br>
were about as foreseeable as the effects of the mistaken retail pricing,
<br>
and if either of these two mistakes had been avoided the problems would
<br>
not have amounted to a crisis.

<em>&gt;The one factor (rising prices) that would normally have allowed demand to

<p>&nbsp;The retail pricing mistakes may be the most important issue to emphasize
<br>
because of governments' widespread pattern of making this type of mistake.
<br>
But your use of the word &quot;normally&quot;, and the paper's attempt to claim that
<br>
it was the only, are probably misleading. We have a long history of retail
<br>
power prices being pretty insensitive to short-term changes, and many
<br>
governments have accomplished this without crises (the main problem being
<br>
inefficiency). The restriction on long-term contracts appears to be the
<br>
least normal contributor to the crisis.
