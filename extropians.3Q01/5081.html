<em>&gt; &gt; ...why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't we just sterilize everyone living in poverty until they can prove 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are financially responsible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;While your question is of course insincere (not to mention disingenuous and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mean-spirited), you're a few centuries too late in your presentation.
</em><br>
<p>To the extent that the question was rhetorical, I suppose you could say it 
<br>
was &quot;insincere&quot; or &quot;disengenuous,&quot; but it was not mean-spirited.  It was 
<br>
just an attempt to show why I take issue with your suggestion that poor 
<br>
parents should have their kids taken away.  If you took offense, please 
<br>
accept my apology.
<br>
<p>If, however, you were calling me &quot;mean-spirited&quot; only to be mean-spirited, 
<br>
then...nuts to you!
<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
