<p><em>&gt;It seems your analogy actually works against your convictions.

<p>Hmmm.  :-(  This is why I kept reminding people that I am *not* against 
<br>
capitalism -- I am just scared of people adhering to it as a religion. 
<br>
&quot;Capitalism alone will work... really it will. Have faith.&quot;
<br>
<p>A quick response to your point of bank deregulation: The biggest disaster 
<br>
in Australian banking was when our government of idiots swallowed that 
<br>
propaganda about deregulation, hook line and sinker. They deregulated the 
<br>
banks, and since then banking costs to the consumer have spiraled upward, 
<br>
the banks have been closing local branches everywhere, and they have been 
<br>
making record profits.
<br>
<p>Yes, yes, you think I am saying &quot;bad capitalism&quot;, but I ain't.  :-)
<br>
<p>Government was originally formed (if I remember my history correctly) to 
<br>
give the population some way to control the powerful individuals (lords, 
<br>
kings, and barons) that oppressed people. Of course, government can step 
<br>
into those same nasty shoes and can be just as dangerous to the people. 
<br>
Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. It doesn't matter 
<br>
if that power is in the hands of government, or big companies, or powerful 
<br>
individuals. It all comes to the same thing.
<br>
<p>We have a new religion taking hold around the world at the moment that 
<br>
convinces people to let the most powerful companies and individuals rule 
<br>
the planet unopposed in the name of &quot;market forces&quot;. People are 
<br>
indoctrinated, perversely, to relinquish all control with faith that the 
<br>
invisible hand of the market will balance all things. This, in the face of 
<br>
innumerable examples of how out-of-control things can get under pure 
<br>
capitalism. Heard of the town of the babies with no brains in Brazil? Union 
<br>
Carbide's disasters in the third world? Nestles' nasty child murdering 
<br>
campaign in Africa? Similar examples can be found of how crazy things get 
<br>
when royalty or governments have too much power.
<br>
<p>Until we find a natural way to stop money and power concentrating in just a 
<br>
few hands, we can only work the powers against each other. Use government 
<br>
as a brake upon big business and powerful individuals, bleeding money from 
<br>
them to redistribute it to society at large. Use big business to criticise 
<br>
and oppose government and royalty and do things more effectively where 
<br>
possible. Use royalty to point out the abuses by government and big 
<br>
business and sponsor humanitarian projects.
<br>
<p>Things are not back and white -- there are many levels of grey.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
