<p>I dont see why not.  Even something as terrifying as 
<br>
rappelling down the side of a tall building would beat 
<br>
the hell outta sitting up there waiting to either suffocate
<br>
on choking fumes, burning or getting buried in the rubble of
<br>
a collapsing tower.  Evidently a few WTCers decided a few
<br>
seconds of freefall with zero chance of survival was
<br>
preferrable to these fates.
<br>
<p>Better idea than rappelling gear: an emergency belt that is
<br>
connected to a steel cable on a reel next to all windows.
<br>
The reel has a centrifugal clutch and damping so that it
<br>
lowers the victim quickly up top and slows her descent 
<br>
near the ground.  Remember the reel is set according to how 
<br>
far it is off the ground.  After the victim unbuckles and
<br>
flees, the device could reel in the cable for the next person.
<br>
Recall that a steel cable strong enough to support a human
<br>
is very small, 2 mm diameter is ample.  In the case of the
<br>
WTC, there would be no need to design it for a 400+ lb person,
<br>
for a lardbutt would be unable to egress from those
<br>
narrow windows in any case.  
<br>
<p>If a lower floor has flames erupting from a window, the cable 
<br>
would not overheat in one place, since unlike the rappelling 
<br>
idea, the cable moves with the escapee.  If we were clever, 
<br>
we could come up with a belt that would automatically release 
<br>
the escapee when she reached terra firma.
<br>
<p>One could also keep in the office one of those firefighter's
<br>
mylar suits and an oxygen cylinder that would last for two
<br>
to three minutes and allow several seconds of direct contact
<br>
with flames.
<br>
<p>In that vein, we could come up with an insulated mylar and
<br>
kevlar blanket or oversized pillowcase that one could
<br>
get inside and attach to the cable, again with a smart-
<br>
release device of some sort.  Perhaps it could lower three
<br>
or four at a time in this manner.
<br>
<p>Each high window could be fitted with a device that allows
<br>
removal of the glass to the inside, thus preventing showering 
<br>
those on the street with glass.
<br>
<p>In fact, better idea:  the outsides of the buildings could
<br>
fitted with a horizontal extendable boom at each window
<br>
with the reel outdoors, so that when a window is drawn
<br>
in, a cable can be reached, then attached to the escapee
<br>
or escape bag.  As soon as the smart device is attached to 
<br>
the escape bag, the device could automatically extend a 
<br>
couple meters and draw the terrified person out the window 
<br>
and lower them, against their will if necessary, which
<br>
would overcome the problem of people chickening out and
<br>
blocking egress by the others.
<br>
<p>Of course, I still like the idea of surface to air
<br>
missiles on the roof.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Actually it is a bit surprising that tall building do not
<br>
have some means of emergency escape other than stairways
<br>
which might be aflame.  These could surely be put in place 
<br>
for less money per office occupant than lifeboats on a 
<br>
cruise ship.  spike
