</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; making a fake picture of Bin Laden might actually be a serious offence
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I've never heard of this. Please explain.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; You might mislead our allies as well as our enemies.  Any faked picture that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is good enough to fool our enemies will also fool our friends.  A private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizen does not know what the government knows, and does not know how their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;fake&quot; photograph is going to mislead their own side.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As an example, say you paste your girlfriend into the arms of bin Laden.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you do when the CIA finds out who she is and wastes time and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources questioning her about her involvement with bin Laden.  Even though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they will eventually find out the truth, you have wasted resources that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could have been used tracking down real threats.
</em><br>
<p>This is a possibility, but not something that would be a criminal act.
<br>
If the CIA wastes resources on it, it is due to their own stupidity. I
<br>
don't think you appreciate how such psychwar works. 
<br>
<p>Whether the followers of bin Laden believe it is the truth or not is
<br>
immaterial. If they are absolutely sure it is false, that makes it an
<br>
even stronger psych weapon agianst bin Laden. In arab culture, there is
<br>
a VERY strong thing about personal and family honor, far stronger than,
<br>
say, the 'machismo' of Latin Americans. 
<br>
<p>For example, if you are an arab in most arab cultures, and your sister
<br>
or daughter has premarital sex, or in some cases just marries someone
<br>
who is not approved by her parents, it is generally seen as your
<br>
honorable duty to kill her. Similarly, making fraudulent accusations
<br>
about a person like those we are talking about puts a significant burden
<br>
on the accused person to seek retribution. It is like a challenge to a
<br>
duel. All of the persons associates who are aware of the challenge to
<br>
the person are watching him to see what his response to the challenge
<br>
is. If you do not properly respond to a challenge like this, you lose
<br>
face and respect among your peers. Your 'virtus' to lead is therefore
<br>
suspect.
<br>
<p>Making claims about the behavior of bin Laden with the behavior of the
<br>
'decadent' Saudis is not a correct way to look at things. To the eyes of
<br>
bin Laden and his associates, the many Mercedes in the desert of Saudis
<br>
getting it on and getting drunk are signs of the depraved western
<br>
corruption of Islam.
