<p><em>&gt;What of the inalienable right to procreate?
</em><br>
<p>*What* inalienable right to procreate?
<br>
<p>Actually, I think people should be *free* to procreate if that's what they
<br>
want, ie there should be no laws against it. This is a pretty good
<br>
ethico-legal principle, at least in first-world nations, and it's part of
<br>
the principle of reproductive liberty. However, there's no basis that I can
<br>
see for a claim-right, ie that everyone else has to provide you with the
<br>
resources to have and raise children.
<br>
<p>Of course, you can look at it, not from a rights point of view, but from a
<br>
*caring* point of view. Perhaps we should all care for the children in our
<br>
vicinity, or our polity, when the first-line of parental care fails. The
<br>
emphasis here is not on the rights of the parents but the needs of children
<br>
and how we feel about those needs. At that point, there may be a legitimate
<br>
role for the state to remove children from parents. But I can see a lot of
<br>
reasons (Zero has alluded to one) why this should be done with enormous
<br>
hesitation and reluctance. Unnecessary state intervention has done untold
<br>
harm in the past.
