<em>&gt; &quot;The Problem&quot; that Carlos very well described, is a problem afflicting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whole society.  Something is very wrong in a region where citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *must* go around armed all the time.  Peace and reasonable security are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolute requirements for wealth creation.
</em><br>
<p>As Hobbes said: &quot;A covenant not to defend myself from force, by force,
<br>
is always void. For no man can transfer, or lay down his Right to save
<br>
himself from Death.&quot;
<br>
<p>Or as John Locke said: &quot;Whosoever uses force without Right .. puts
<br>
himself into a state of war with those, against whom he so uses it, and
<br>
in that state all former ties are cancelled, all other rights cease, and
<br>
every one has a right to defend himself, and to resist the agressor....
<br>
Private persons have a right to defend themselves and recover by force
<br>
what by unlawful force is taken from them.&quot;
<br>
<p>or as Sir William Blackstone (the British jurist who figures so
<br>
prominently in the history of common law, and author of 'Commentaries on
<br>
the Laws of England'(4 vols, 1755-9)): &quot;In a land of liberty, it is
<br>
extremely dangerous to make a distinct order of the profession of
<br>
arms... No man should take up arms, but with a veiw to defend his
<br>
country and its laws; he puts not off the citizen when he enters the
<br>
camp.&quot; He also said,&quot;The fifth and last auxilliary right of the subject,
<br>
that I shall at present mention, is that of having arms for their
<br>
defence... of the natural rights of resistance and self preservation,
<br>
when the sanctions of society and the laws are found insufficient to
<br>
restrain the violence of oppression.&quot;
<br>
<p>Note that early police forces were not permitted to be armed, they were
<br>
required to depend upon armed citizens to provide backup. The first gun
<br>
control laws in England in the 19th century did not apply to civilians
<br>
at all, only to police forces.
<br>
<p>Being armed is a responsibility of citizenship, and as to free market
<br>
republican society, Adam Smith said, &quot;Men of Republican principles have
<br>
been jealous of a standing army as dangerous to liberty... the standing
<br>
army of Ceasar destroyd the Roman Republic as that of Cromwell turned
<br>
the Long Parliament out of doors.&quot;
<br>
<p>As that rabble rouser of liberty, Thomase Paine said, &quot;The peaceable
<br>
part of mankind shall be continually overrun by the vile and abandoned
<br>
while the neglect the means of self-defence. The supposed quietude of a
<br>
good man allures the ruffian; while on the other hand, arms like laws
<br>
discourage and keep the invader and the plunderer in awe, and preserve
<br>
order in the world as well as property. The balance of power is the
<br>
scale of peace. The same balance would be preserved were all the world
<br>
destitute of arms, for all would be alike; but since some WILL not,
<br>
others DARE not lay them aside... Horrid mischief would ensue were one
<br>
half of the world deprived of the use of them;... the weak will become
<br>
prey to the strong.&quot;
<br>
<p>You do not achieve 'peace and reasonable security' by laying down your
<br>
last means of defence, nor do you ensure tyrannies, petty and vast, come
<br>
not to fruition by depriving yourself while arming only those you
<br>
empower to lead and guard you.
<br>
<p>Note that where the individual is armed, confiscatory forces that
<br>
deprive economic prosperity do not show any strength. Tooting the horn
<br>
of my state, we have the second highest per capita income, with the
<br>
lowest unemployment along with one of the highest gun ownership rates
<br>
(and one of the lowest crime rates), and one of the lowest tax rates,
<br>
and one of the highest economic growth rates. These are not
<br>
coincidences.
<br>
<p>The problems of Brazil and Argentina are not of an armed populace, but a
<br>
failure of an attempt to privatize their economies. Instead, they have
<br>
become just two more petty mercantilist economies, which treat social
<br>
programs as merely bribes to keep the masses at bay. Only by arming the
<br>
population as a whole can a just resolution to these crises be
<br>
developed.
