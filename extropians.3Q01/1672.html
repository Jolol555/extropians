<em>&gt;   - it is not really a major point worth pursuing over days and days of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; email -- how hard can it be to understand that elevating capitalism to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion status  is dangerous?
</em><br>
<p>This is beside the point.  I agree with the point that religion is wrong and
<br>
faith is wrong.  They're bad epistemology.  I'm sure many people on this
<br>
list agree with that too.
<br>
<p>That said, NOT everyone who think free markets are better than the
<br>
alternatives -- whether they support them or not -- is religious about it.
<br>
One can, after all, look at the logic and the facts and come to that
<br>
conclusion.  Or is that forbidden?
<br>
<p>To automatically assume anyone who is for laissez faire capitalism or who
<br>
takes any other principled stance is religious is faulty in the extreme.  It
<br>
disregards why someone would hold a position and just says any such position
<br>
must be religious.
<br>
<p>Also, it's not an escape to remain agnostic here.  That does not mean your
<br>
thinking is not religious.  One can have just as much faith in that position
<br>
as any other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I did respond where:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   - I felt people were honestly trying to make logical arguments
</em><br>
<p>I was and these were cavelierly avoided by you.  I would present my
<br>
counterargument and instead of answering it, you moved on to arguing about
<br>
another case.  I would then present my counterargument for that case and you
<br>
would do the same.  Is it strange how you started with healthcare and
<br>
finally arrived at some conspiracy view of baby formula distribution in
<br>
Africa?  (I'm not dismissing your claim.  I just very little way of
<br>
verifying it, which is why I've stuck to areas where I have done a little
<br>
studying.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  - the misrepresentation of what I said made me take the bait  :-(
</em><br>
<p>Misrepresentation?  I thought the misrepresentation was to base your
<br>
position about free markets failing on cases where they had not actually
<br>
been free.  If someone took one aspirin and then jumped off a cliff and
<br>
died, would you use this as evidence that the aspirin did him in?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;To me this sounds a lot like when I debate with Creationists.  They will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;tell me evolution is disproven by some case A.  When I show them that
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are wrong about A, they ignore this and bring up case B.  When I show
</em><br>
them
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that they are wrong about B, they ignore this and bring up case C.  And
</em><br>
so
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;on.  I think you get where I'm going.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is just plain wrong, and a little insulting.
</em><br>
<p>It's insulting to be dismissed and ignored and also to be labeled religious
<br>
from the start.  The whole presumption of the subject header in this thread
<br>
has been that anyone who argues free markets work better than anything else
<br>
can't possibly be rational.  To start out by calling your opponents
<br>
religious, to me, is to begin with an insult.  It's no different than
<br>
calling someone a racist in this context.
<br>
<p>It's hardly appropriate to cry that you are now insulted.  (And my point was
<br>
not so much to insult you as to get your attention.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have tried to sound a note of caution -- that free market capitalism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient though it is, and probably the best economic model to date, is a
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; flawed model. Being blinded to those flaws by faith is just asking for
</em><br>
trouble.
<br>
<p>Where do I do that?  Please do show me!  I want to be enlightened.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are defending something which is only under attack if it dogma.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it is a reasoned point of view then there is nothing to defend from
</em><br>
what
<br>
<em>&gt; I have said.
</em><br>
<p>Then why have you not answered my reasoned position on these various issues?
<br>
You've only ignored my counterarguments and repeated that you are not
<br>
against capitalism.  In fact, the thing about your not being against
<br>
capitalism reminds of Marc Antony's funeral oration in Shakespeare's &quot;Julius
<br>
Caesar.&quot;  &quot;And Brutus is an honorable man.&quot;
