Agreed. This is basically the reason that &quot;smart cards&quot; are a dumb
<br>
<p>idea. If you are already checking with a remote database,
<br>
you don't need anything more than an ID number. The card can and
<br>
should be nothing more than a way to automate inputting that number,
<br>
as with credit cards today. The nature of the remote data
<br>
(central or distributed, government, corporate, or private) is a
<br>
completely separate issue from whether or not the card is smart.
<br>
<p>My personal favorite is to try to positively identify each person
<br>
entering the country and validate them against a central government
<br>
database. We alreaady try to do this with passports, etc., so there
<br>
is no additional loss of privacy. The reasons for a central database
<br>
is to avoid document forgery. for this to be effective, we need to
<br>
cooperate with Canada and Mexico, since our borders with those countries
<br>
cannot easily be closed or controlled. This approach will not help much
<br>
against terrorists born in these three countries, but I see it as the
<br>
most cost-effective defense against the most likely real attacks.
<br>
<p>I would reccommend both fingerprint and face recognition.
