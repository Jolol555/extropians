Allow me to make a comment on this :
<br>
<p><p>Samantha Atkins a écrit (27.9.2001/02:02) :
<br>
<em>&gt; See what happens to close minded people?  They draw highly inaccurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parallels and get somewhat insulting of those who think differently.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously is quite important to recognize what it is that we do that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provokes terrorists activities and a great deal of hate toward this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country.  Some of it is for our virtues, true enough.  But more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a little is also for our faults, especially faults of policy and of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action.
</em><br>
<p><p>The idea that you (the US) are somehow responsible for these attacks
<br>
has some popularity here in France. But on this instance, it doesn't
<br>
seem true. The islamists just want to impose their world order,
<br>
according to their sense of justice. It has little to do with wrongs
<br>
you would have done according to YOUR sense of justice.
<br>
<p>A French editorialist (Serge July) ended an article recently saying :
<br>
&quot;we should remember that the only real solution to terrorism is
<br>
justice&quot;. This is an illusion : you just cannot imagine that, the
<br>
world being fair according to your sense of justice, a large group of
<br>
people could want to kill you ; but as a matter of fact, that's the
<br>
the way it is. According to their sense of justice, your very life is
<br>
an offense to the Creator. They hate you. Not for what you have done
<br>
to them ; for your (lack of) beliefs, for your way of living, for your
<br>
Infidelity.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If we cannot admit where there are valid claims against us and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act to correct such things where possible then we are irresponsible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and dishonest as a nation and as individual citizens of that nation.
</em><br>
<p><p>The word &quot;valid&quot; is the problem. Their claims (like having Jews out of
<br>
Palestine, and having US out of Saoudi, and finally extending islam
<br>
over the planet) are valid according to them, but not according to you
<br>
(well, to me at least). As this translates in attacks on you, you
<br>
cannot afford so much tolerance as to treat them as &quot;valid&quot;, even if
<br>
they are valid in some sense (= they are consistant with their sense
<br>
of justice).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I personally find it quite disturbing when Bush said that other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries are either with us and by implicaiton with our policies in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our &quot;war on terrorism&quot; or are with the terrorists.  That is a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous and blatantly false dichotomy.  One can be very much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against terrorism and still not believe the planned and proposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions are reasonable and not back them.  The same is true of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations.  Just because we have been hurt badly is not an excuse for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polarizing the world into &quot;for US&quot; and &quot;against US&quot;.  
</em><br>
<p><p>Of course this is a bit of a constraint. But I think it is quite
<br>
understandable. The US have been hurt, they seek back up. It doesn't
<br>
seem very responsible from us (France) to decline it -- and then ask
<br>
more support from you when things go worse.
<br>
<p><p>As to the link with extropian preoccupations, I think an important
<br>
link is : how we deal, not technically, but &quot;morally&quot;, with such
<br>
situations.
<br>
<p><p>Jacques Du Pasquier
