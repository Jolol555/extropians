<br>
<p>Have you ever seen that TV commercial (come to think of it, I haven't seen
<br>
it of late - probably due to the dismal stock climate) with a guy named
<br>
&quot;Stewart,&quot; who is a kind of a young goof-off guy with his own sense of
<br>
wardrobe, who is good with the computer and who teaches his boss
<br>
(stereotyped as the usual pasty conservative middle-aged male office drone)
<br>
how to &quot;E-trade?&quot;  The boss learns how to trade online (with Stewart at his
<br>
side coaching him), and subsequently makes a trade which is short of risky,
<br>
we are led to believe, because then Stewart starts to makes klucky chicken
<br>
noises and (here my memory fails or my imagination takes over, as I think
<br>
Stewart may have flapped his arms up and down a bit for effect).  In any
<br>
case, the boss doesn't get his knickers bunched up, it's all in fun.
<br>
Stewart even invites his boss to a party.  The boss is a bit addled, but
<br>
pleased.  End of commercial.
<br>
<p>I was being the &quot;Stewart&quot; character - I was just teasing you a little.
<br>
<p>C'est tout,
<br>
Olga
