<em>&gt;From: &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20GOP%20standards%20were%20higher%20than%20DEM%20standards&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108081608.JAA03285@well.com&gt;">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;Wrong.  The Republicans only followed the law and election
</em><br>
<em>&gt;procedures where they wanted to.  They rejected the law that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;required postmarks on all absentee ballots because the military
</em><br>
<em>&gt;votes did not have postmarks.  They counted these votes &quot;to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fair&quot; even though it violated the law.
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me Harvey, but this is incorrect.
<br>
<p>There is a Federal law which explicitly states that military
<br>
absentee ballots do not require postmarks.
<br>
<p>It was Al &quot;every vote should be counted&quot; Gore who did eveything he
<br>
could to exclude these votes. In my opinion he can add hypocrite to
<br>
his list of accomplishments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I am constantly amazed by the perception on both sides that only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the other side played unfairly.  I see neither side acting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;superior to the other in the Florida elections.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;One side note:  Later studies show that many other states had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worse problems with uncounted ballots.  It was only Florida's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sunshine law and pivotal role in the election that put the focus
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on Florida.  Most state elections are just as screwed up, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;media does not have access to the counting process in those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;states, and there was not as much attention given to those states.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this completely. Al Gore won Illinois by something
<br>
like 2 votes per precinct, I don't doubt for a second there was
<br>
foul play at work.
<br>
<p><p>I think it was clear that the election system is sadly in need of
<br>
a high tech as well as low tech overhaul.
