<em>&gt; &gt; The problem, as I see it, is that these CEOs don't deserve a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; layoffs.  The logic is that cost-cutting makes the company more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and raises profits.  However, these layoffs aren't really cost-cutting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this view misses a few things.  No CEO enjoys laying off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employees.  It is one of the toughest and most delicate tasks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a CEO can face.  But it is the CEO's job (and why he makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the big bucks) to make even hard and personally painful choices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the good of the company he was hired to lead.
</em><br>
<p>I never said it was an easy job.  My point was that it was difficult to do
<br>
right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business climate changes and many projects that people were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hired for simply will not fly in the current climate and when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they will is unknown there is little good sense in keeping the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people on if they cannot be integrated into other projects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to be successful.  And this is only one of many, many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenarios that could make layoffs a necessity for the health of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the organization.
</em><br>
<p>I never said to keep the people on.  I said that after the people are laid
<br>
off there is a second step that must occur.  If the company doesn't adapt
<br>
itself in some way to be able to do more with less people, the cutbacks
<br>
alone won't solve the problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A business is not in business primarily to give its employees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employment.  It is primarily in business to be a profitable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful enterprise within certain stated company objectives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is the CEO's job to ensure this success to the maximum of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his/her abilities.  It is a tough job.
</em><br>
<p>I never said it was.  I was discussing the value to the shareholders.  I
<br>
never discussed employee benefits.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is nonsense.  The organization must grow and shrink in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response to the environment and its needs.
</em><br>
<p>I never said that companies shouldn't grow and shrink.  I am describing how
<br>
they must do this to adapt.  Growing without adaptation is bloat.  Shrinking
<br>
without adaptation is starvation.  Adaptation must occur to function with a
<br>
different resource mix.  Otherwise, the new resource level doesn't match the
<br>
requirements.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Layoff employees that you can no longer gainfully keep is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical and utterly necessary to the health of the company and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the continued employment of the rest of the employees.
</em><br>
<p>I never said it wasn't.  Are you even reading what I wrote?  None of your
<br>
points seem to address what I said.  Your statements don't dispute anything
<br>
I said.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, this is largely false.  During hard times various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means of cost-cutting and changes of working methodologies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put into place.
</em><br>
<p>This is exactly what my posting said.  Cost-cutting alone is not enough.  It
<br>
must be followed by changes of working methodologies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is BS.  Try the job yourself some time and see what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think.
</em><br>
<p>I have a business degree and have run my own consulting company for a
<br>
decade.  All my employees more than six figures, and I have never had to lay
<br>
anyone off.  Even in so-called hard times, I find a way to adapt.
<br>
<p>One of the reasons I believe this, is that my company provides the temp
<br>
workers to replace the laid-off employees.  CEOs lay off employees to
<br>
impress stock-holders.  Then they don't change their business plan, so they
<br>
still need workers.  So they hire temp employees at double or triple the
<br>
salary of the original employees.  The companies lose money faster.  Those
<br>
that listen to my advice on how to become more efficient will survive.
<br>
Those that don't and try to do the exact same job with less resources will
<br>
fail.  Without increased efficiency, less resources equal less value.
<br>
<p>I am not just playing armchair businessman here.  I actually am practicing
<br>
what I preach.
