<p>
&nbsp;With the still simmering discussion of race and the gloss of &quot;conservative&quot;
<br>
vs. &quot;liberal&quot; that's been placed on it, along with references to David Duke,
<br>
posting of articles from sources that are clearly in the &quot;traditional
<br>
&nbsp;values&quot; camp, shading into outright racist and white-supremacist material,
<br>
I thought I'd offer some musings on terminology and ideology.
<br>
&nbsp;As usual, some personal background as context: I come to my current
<br>
libertarianism primarily from a &quot;left-liberal&quot; adolescent and early adult
<br>
mind-set.  Recently I came across some things I wrote 25 years ago or so,
<br>
and I was amazed at how &quot;red&quot; my sentiments and values were.  It was an
<br>
interesting exercise to look into how I could have written the things I did.
<br>
Most of it could be attributed to a very deep ignorance of how in fact the
<br>
world really works.  My world-view was influenced by a few sketchy ideas
<br>
about &quot;business&quot; and &quot;corporations&quot; that, in the hindsight of knowledge
<br>
gained from real work in the real world of business and law, I can now see
<br>
to be utterly wrong.  Among these grossly incorrect assumptions (which at
<br>
the time I strongly believed to be facts) were the ideas that large
<br>
corporations were controlled as monoliths by just a few very wealthy
<br>
individuals and that it was harder to rise into positions of control over
<br>
parts of the economic and social machinery of power in our society than in
<br>
fact it is.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Even though an adult life slowly but surely maneuvering through that
<br>
machinery of economic and social power has significantly changed my ideas of
<br>
how society does and should work, there is a residue of sentiment from my
<br>
early world view.  I still have a deep distaste for the outward trappings of
<br>
what I saw in my youth as &quot;conservative&quot; ideas.  The superficial signs of
<br>
the culture of mid-20th-century American &quot;establishment&quot; institutions and
<br>
ways of life set off negative emotional reactions within me that are not
<br>
necessarily rational, but are there nonetheless.  Thus, anything that comes
<br>
from a source that espouses &quot;white-bread&quot;, &quot;Leave It To Beaver&quot; values or
<br>
uses the code-words of the more contemporary and self-conscious movement of
<br>
cultural conservatism raises my hackles.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Distrust for the semiotics of the left, on the other hand, is for me a
<br>
completely &quot;rational&quot;, self-taught attitude.  Interestingly, I feel I have
<br>
more or less successfully inoculated myself against the icons of modern
<br>
American liberalism as a balance to my essentially instinctive caution when
<br>
confronting the signs of &quot;conservatism&quot;.  Thus now I have just as much of a
<br>
feeling of revulsion when I see Warren Beatty as I do when I see David Duke.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I perceive that much of the talk here about race and other issues that are
<br>
addressed by the two polarized camps of modern Western ideology (this
<br>
includes personal weapons and religion) involves emotional or sentimental
<br>
reactions to the superficial signs exhibited by the sources of material
<br>
offered for discussion, as well as the terminology used by some of the
<br>
posters here.  Expressions of suspicion of affirmative action and defense of
<br>
gun rights triggers a kind of emotional revulsion in some people, because
<br>
those views are identified with knuckle-dragging cultural conservatives.
<br>
Sensitivity to the injustice of past and current racism and a desire to seek
<br>
social security likewise evokes a feeling of disgust in others, because
<br>
those are causes espoused by the collectivist, &quot;leveler&quot; pole of the public
<br>
discourse on policy and culture.  Like it or not, those emotional reactions
<br>
are real and effect our thinking.  It helps to be as aware of them as we can
<br>
be, because when we aren't, we tend to caricature the persons who may be
<br>
speaking in terms that trigger those reactions.  The bottom line is that
<br>
just because someone is willing to question the wisdom or moral rightness of
<br>
affirmative action doesn't mean that they subscribe to the entirety of the
<br>
reactionary program of the culturally conservative &quot;right&quot;, any more than
<br>
that every one who might wonder whether SOME restrictions on the private
<br>
ownership of weapons is a Stalinist.
