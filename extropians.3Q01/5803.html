<em>&gt; Conclusion: ant watchers are ________
</em><br>
<p>Ant watchers, if they persist for a lifetime, and if their persistence is
<br>
motivated by scientific discovery, are on the road to receiving a Lifetime
<br>
Achievement award.
<br>
<p>Lifetime achievement: E.O. Wilson

(TIME) -- &quot;Study nature, not books!&quot; advised the great 19th century naturalist
<br>
Louis Agassiz. As a boy growing up in Alabama and northern Florida, Edward
<br>
Osborne Wilson did both. By day he scoured fields, forests and streams. At
<br>
night he pored over books and magazines. It was an article in National
<br>
Geographic (&quot;Stalking Ants, Savage and Civilized&quot;) that launched, at the ripe
<br>
age of 9, one of the great scientific careers of the late 20th century, a
<br>
career that began in entomology with a particular passion for ants, but that
<br>
has since reinvented itself with remarkable frequency, expanding its scope to
<br>
encompass not just the earth's smallest creatures but the whole living planet.
<br>
E.O. Wilson's scientific contributions began early. He was 13 when he
<br>
discovered, in a vacant lot near the docks of Mobile, Alabama, the first known
<br>
U.S. colonies of fire ants, Solenopsis invicta, invaders from Brazil and
<br>
Argentina known in the South as &quot;the ants from hell.&quot;
<br>
<p>As an assistant professor at Harvard in the late 1950s, he proposed the
<br>
radical notion that ant societies are bound together by an elaborate system of
<br>
chemical signals. He went on to prove the existence of what are now called
<br>
pheromones with an elegant experiment. Pied Piperlike, he lured a stream of
<br>
worker ants along a chemical trail laid down with pheromones extracted from a
<br>
gland in the abdomen of a fire ant.
<br>
<p>-------------------------
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
