<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; &gt;someone buys you a 10 cent aspirin. You DO NOT have the right to take other 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; &gt;peoples property (or have the government take it for you). You must rely on 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; &gt;voluntary contributions and charity if you want to be moral. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; OK... I would have said this a little differently, but let's take your 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; example. It reduces to: A person's right to life is dwarfed by another 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; person's right to wealth. Huh?!? 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; You can see how silly this line gets. This will happen anytime you try to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; talk about morality in terms of absolutes. This is exactly what religions do. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Miriam, it is quite simple: what IS wealth? What IS money? It is a 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;symbol of value added by labor. Every dollar in the world represents 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;time from someone's life spent sweating their butt when they could have 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;been smelling the roses. Some people's ideas, decisions, and leadership 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;skills are immensely valuable, so some people make more money than 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;others. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;So the question is: in a society that abhors slavery, what is the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;rationale for confiscating the labor of free individuals? I have yet to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;hear anyone come up with an explaination why enslaving 100% of the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;population 10% of the time is any less morally abhorrent than enslaving 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;10% of the people 100% of the time. If you can come up with a morally 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;and logically consistent answer to this, I am all ears. Nobody else has 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to date. 
<DIV></DIV>
<P>I prefer to see govt as management running a jointly owned place of business --&nbsp; the USA (england etc).&nbsp; People vote for the management much as stockholders vote for management.</P>
<P>What is the rationale for the the management of this place of business throwing-out/fining&nbsp; some owner who refuses to pay his share of&nbsp; maintenance fees? Same thing, etc....</P>
<P>You may well argue that the fees are misspent; no doubt there is such in any large corporation; but if you don't like the situation, you can leave (or try to change it).</P>
<P>Slaves can't leave; they are chained. Taxpayers who don't like the maintenance fees, can leave....no chains!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<DIV></DIV>&gt;In a socialist society of any degree (social democracy or communist 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;totalitarian), the most productive individuals pay the largest 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;percentage of their labor to be given in services to the least 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;productive members, who contribute little or nothing to the services of 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the whole. This may work fine in a family, which is an entirely 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;voluntary proposition for the productive members to engage in, but this 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;family economy cannot be extrapolated to society as a whole without 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;immense coersion by the force of the state, and therefore, is engaging 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;in slavery. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I hear this 'it's for the children' excuse all the time, and I see 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;parents whining all the time irrationally &quot;I didn't ask to be a parent&quot; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;(totally ignoring, of course, of the causal factors involved), and 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;expecting that I pay through income, property, sales, and other taxes, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;for the cost of their stupidity. Guess what? I CAN say 'I didn't ask to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;be a parent', because I'm not in the biological sense, but in the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;economic sense, I sure am expected to be. Any attempt I make at avoiding 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;paying 'my fair share' is looked on with scorn, jealousy, and hate, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;despite the fact that it should be I who has those feelings, and justly. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Just HOW do you justify my enslavement?
