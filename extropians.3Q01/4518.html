<p><em>&gt;&gt;How many of you know that Newton reasoned that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;probability of flipping two coins and coming up with two heads is 1/3
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He has lots of modern company. This is essentially the same error made by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those who lambasted Marilyn vos Savant over her &quot;Let's Make a Deal&quot; puzzle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Some of those were mathematicians, who should know better.
</em><br>
<p>No, it is not at all the same.  In fact, I doubt if Newton ever made such an
<br>
error; in the absence of a good source for the claim, it is more plausible
<br>
that this is just another amusing but false fable aimed at showing that
<br>
&quot;geniuses can be just as dumb as you and I&quot;.  Newton was born 20 years after
<br>
Pascal, and died more than 50 years after Pascal.  He could not possibly
<br>
have been unaware of Pascal's work, including the first combinatorial steps
<br>
toward a proper theory of probability, and he was no slouch at combinatorics
<br>
himself.
<br>
<p>As for &quot;those who lambasted Marilyn vos Savant&quot;, she deserved it.  In that
<br>
case (as opposed to the unlikely Newton error), there are multiple mental
<br>
models of the problem that one can form, which lead to different conditional
<br>
probabilities.  It is pointless to ask which is correct (that question is
<br>
meaningless unless we first adopt some criterion for resolving the
<br>
ambiguity).  The interesting questions concern the ambiguity itself -- what
<br>
does it teach us about the hazards (and the entertainment value) of
<br>
formulating mathematical statements in natural language?  There is a word
<br>
for people who have no significant math training, but claim to have solved
<br>
hard problems (she also took a stab at the Fermat Problem as I recall), and
<br>
then get their knickers in a twist when their errors are pointed out by
<br>
people who do have math training.  They are called cranks.  Being &quot;the
<br>
world's smartest woman&quot; doesn't make her immune.

<p><em>&gt;Personally I think ‘odds’ are an imaginary concept invented to promote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gambling, like thanksgiving was invented to promote retail sales
</em><br>
<p>Well, probability theory (or some of its applications anyway) does have
<br>
fortean aspects I admit.  For instance, the frequency interpretation of
<br>
probability is invariably introduced by considering successive flips of a
<br>
coin, and we are expected to believe that the probability of heads is 1/2 if
<br>
the coin is &quot;unbiased&quot;.  But what is an unbiased coin?  Surely it can only
<br>
be a coin for which the probability of heads is 1/2.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Would it be okay to clip posts to make smaller replies
</em><br>
<p>Eh?  If I had clipped any more there wouldn't have been any quoted material
<br>
at all, and the reader would have been left to puzzle out what was being
<br>
referred to.  Or are you asking if it's OK for *you* to clip posts?  By all
<br>
means go ahead, you have my blessing. ;-)

<p><em>&gt;If you overlook the pesky fact that those who wrote in to lambaste Marilyn
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had the very same &quot;mental model&quot; of the problem that she did but still got
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Gotta quibble with you here, snopes.  Certainly some of her critics were as
<br>
clueless as she was.  But the original poster was implying that (1) vos
<br>
Savant was correct, which is simply false; and (2) the mathematicians who
<br>
criticized her did so groundlessly, which is also false.
<br>
<p>Someone who asserts that Andrew Wiles's solution of the Fermat problem is
<br>
incorrect because he didn't use Euclidean geometry (!), and then refuses to
<br>
accept persuasive information to the contrary, is a crank in my book.

<br>
<p>For the record I am concerned with offending someone by reposting/altering
<br>
their material, thanks for allowing me some latitude in trying to not be
<br>
repetitious boring
<br>
Is there a grammatical tool for this, the best I   come up with is
<br>
‘personally…sales’ steve  or should I just include the whole post in the
<br>
reply
<br>
The statistics + something [forgot what it was] course I took in school left
<br>
me with the opinion it is 1in 2, yes or no, on or off, and correlation of
<br>
random data is a risky business at best fraudulently misleading most of the
<br>
time such as in the case of surveys and censuses
