<p><em>&gt; [Lee wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; In most cases that I've seen, those pile-on &quot;attacks&quot; have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; merely been *many* people expressing their take.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And you don't think these people talk to each other, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each cheer what the others write, and egg each other on?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, they do.  So what?  You cannot suppose that your own
<br>
ideological allies don't do the same.  Moreover, it doesn't
<br>
really matter if they egg each other on or not.  What matter
<br>
are the tone of the discussion and the logic of the arguments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;AND TALK ABOUT TAKING NO PRISONERS.  Look at what you wrote, Joe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Now honestly,  do you not perceive that---even in the slightest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;way---your criticism could just as easily be directed at your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;own post?   May we not lower the level of denunciation just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;little *here*---just for a while (I'm not calling for complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;elimination of denunciation, by any means).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course the level of denunciation was high; I was giving a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doppelganger object lesson in what I have been repeatedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealt; phrases like 'pinko social collectivist hand-wringing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bleeding heart commie LIBERAL&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  There has been some of that.  But I think damned little;
<br>
though here one's impression would depend heavily on whether
<br>
one was the target.  By the way, thanks very much for discussing
<br>
this further without any more name-calling.  &quot;Getting even&quot; only
<br>
makes things worse, and accomplishes nothing more than ensuring
<br>
that your ideological adversaries pigeon-hole you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Let's count the emotionally loaded words in this.  (First, you *were*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; warning Eric about the libertarians on this list, I was not in error.)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Please cite the post in the archives; I honestly don't remember doing so.
</em><br>
<p>A thousand apologies!  I cannot figure out why I thought *you*
<br>
wrote it.  It was Tiberius Gracchus who wrote it.  He send it
<br>
at Sat 8/4/2001 6:46 AM:
<br>
<p>&quot;Oh my. The extropians are not gonna like you. They are going
<br>
to call you a troll and a socialist.&quot;
<br>
<p>No wonder you couldn't remember it!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Okay.  1 - by those trolling    2 - slander   3 - &quot;self-righteous-wing&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (I think that Joe means right-wing).  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mean self-righteously right-wing - the secular equivalent of the religious 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right, and just as absolutist, messianic and condemnatory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; And then there is the statement about his adversaries being (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; projecting) logical incoherence and not being rooted in factual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reality.  Your typos would diminish if you became less emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in all of this; you are among friends, I assure you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was no typo;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it was, I was referring (and I quoted) the following:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Such sellf-righteous-wing people seem to have a highly developed sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of psychological projection which proves to be rootless with respect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical coherency or factual reality.  I have even been told by one...
</em><br>
<p>:-)  So I'm not completely crazy, there are two &quot;l&quot;s there.  Small typo, I guess.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Yes!  Good, right!  I have seen libertarians do exactly what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; say. They'll effectively dismiss arguments and posters by sentences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; containing such terms *without* supplementing those phrases by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rational explanation.  But then, on the other hand, some people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; write things like &quot;socioculturally ludditic conservatives&quot;, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; So, you see, it happens from all quarters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd have to drop a Spruce Goose load of such denunciations to go to even begin 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to tilt the balance towards something remotely resembling parity around here.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I've not seen much of it lately.  Anyway, name-calling unsupported
<br>
by argument needs to be dropped from everyone's behavior.  But again, 
<br>
isn't it objectively true that there are quite a number of posters with
<br>
collectivist and socialist leanings?  Naturally, one should make clear
<br>
at least in context what one means by such terms; here I mean by
<br>
&quot;collectivist&quot;, state-sponsored actions on a large-scale for purposes
<br>
of redistribution of wealth or on-high enforcement of majority-decided
<br>
moral norms of the non-traditional variety (e.g., outlawing some kinds
<br>
of personal freedoms that were, say, usual in America in 1850, e.g.,
<br>
discriminating against whomever you pleased for whatever reason you
<br>
pleased).  Same, I think, for &quot;socialist&quot;.
<br>
<p>Or do you consider those just insult words.  For example, calling anyone
<br>
a &quot;fascist&quot; or a &quot;racist&quot; on this list is quite wrong and is name-calling,
<br>
unless you back it up awfully well.  This is true because not a soul
<br>
admits to such a description.  But if you do as I have done, to wit
<br>
(in reverse) by, e.g., saying that some people have made racist
<br>
statements, then it of course has to be demonstrated by quoting the 
<br>
precise source.  So do you think that &quot;socialist&quot; and &quot;collectivist&quot;
<br>
as adjectives are often misapplied?
