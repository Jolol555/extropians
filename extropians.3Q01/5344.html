From: &quot;Lee Corbin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20What%20is%20True%20About%20the%20World%20(was:%20%20new%20to%20list)&In-Reply-To=&lt;002701c130f4$0cc3da40$c8c8f418@southmount.com&gt;">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; I really think that the categories &quot;correct&quot; and &quot;incorrect&quot; don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serve us well here.  In science, the degree to which something is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct relates very strongly to the degree to which it can be used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make successful predictions.
</em><br>
I'm not sure I see your point. One can make an infinite number of successful
<br>
predictions from the Ptolemaic system, as Seafarers with sextants will
<br>
attest to.
<br>
<em>&gt;  So you will see in a majority of
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, even if we tried to cling to your rigid notion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;correctness&quot;, then we'd be in no position, really, to announce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that QM or GR is correct; in fact, (as you say), we know that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't cover each other's realms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Approximate assertions, e.g., &quot;the planets orbit the sun in ellipses&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be taken as (a) true, and (b) a correct description of reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even calling such assertions &quot;approximate&quot; is misleading, because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carries the implication that there are assertions that are &quot;certain&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is also nonsense.
</em><br>
I don't follow your argument here. 'Approximate' seems to be what
<br>
philosophers of science mean by 'verisimilitude', i.e., closeness to the
<br>
truth. Thus, it is often said that Newtonianism has greater verisimilitude
<br>
than Aristotelianism, and Einsteinianism more than Newtonianism. According
<br>
to the proponents of this view, one can maintain this without thereby being
<br>
committed to the truth of Einsteinianism. To say that a theory is
<br>
approximately true might commit one to some notion of verisimilitude but why
<br>
certainty? The former--approximate, truth, correctness--are metaphysical
<br>
notions--while certainty is an epistemlogical notion. How do you see them
<br>
related? I would have thought that if anything, skepticism would be a
<br>
natural bedfellow for this view, not certainty. Mark.
