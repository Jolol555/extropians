<p>Superpowerful explosive arrives with a bang 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;

Justin Mullins 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
An accidental explosion in a German physics lab has led to the identification 
<br>
of a superpowerful explosive. The substance - an exotic form of silicon - 
<br>
releases seven times as much energy as TNT, and explodes a million times 
<br>
faster.
<br>
<p>&quot;This might be the strongest explosive ever discovered,&quot; says Dmitri Kovalev, 
<br>
the physicist who runs the laboratory at the Technical University of Munich 
<br>
in Garching.
<br>
<p>Kovalev and his team were studying the optical properties of porous silicon, 
<br>
a sponge-like material. The group had cooled the silicon in a vacuum to the 
<br>
temperature of liquid nitrogen, when suddenly a leak in their equipment 
<br>
allowed air into the device. The silicon exploded. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We realised immediately that oxygen was condensing on the sample and that 
<br>
the oxidation was happening explosively,&quot; says Kovalev. 
<br>
<p><p>Chain reaction 
<br>
<p><p>Porous silicon has a layer of hydrogen just one atom thick covering its 
<br>
surface. This creates a barrier between oxygen atoms and the silicon atoms 
<br>
beneath. But when a single hydrogen bond breaks, an oxygen atom can bind to 
<br>
the silicon, starting a chain reaction that rips through the structure like 
<br>
wildfire. 
<br>
<p>The explosion is so violent because oxidising silicon releases a huge amount 
<br>
of energy compared with conventional explosives. And using liquid oxygen 
<br>
rather than gas means there are lots of oxygen atoms at the silicon surface. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Most explosive molecules contain too few oxygen atoms for a complete burn,&quot; 
<br>
says Kovalev. Because the silicon is sponge-like, it has a very high 
<br>
surface-area-to-volume ratio and this creates a very efficient burn. 
<br>
<p>So far nobody has been hurt by exploding silicon and Kovalev believes that it 
<br>
can be handled safely. &quot;It requires a rather special set of conditions to 
<br>
explode, so in normal use it is quite safe,&quot; he says. His results will appear 
<br>
in Physical Review Letters.
<br>
<p><p>Satellite thrusters 
<br>
<p><p>Leigh Canham is a physicist who specialises in porous silicon and has set up 
<br>
a company called pSiMedica in Malvern to exploit the material. He thinks that 
<br>
porous silicon could one day provide thrust for small satellites.
<br>
<p>Scientists are currently building thrusters comprising a silicon chip with an 
<br>
array of holes packed with conventional explosives (New Scientist, 10 April 
<br>
1999, p 38). Each hole can be detonated separately. 
<br>
<p>But &quot;why use conventional explosives when the silicon itself could provide 
<br>
the thrust,&quot; asks Canham. 
<br>
<p>However, Peter Haskins, a theoretical chemist specialising in explosives, 
<br>
questions whether porous silicon will be ever be useful as an explosive: 
<br>
&quot;There's certainly a lot of energy in there but whether it'd be practical to 
<br>
use at this temperature, I'm not so sure.&quot;
