</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I didn't say it wasn't, but you must admit that this is a policy that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; generally exclusive to the left.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is surely quite irrelevant one way or the other, isn't it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I still have a lot of trouble with &quot;left&quot; vs. &quot;right&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labels.  They are largely irrelevant.  Classification in 2-3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dimensions is more interesting for categorizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political/economic views.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I think it's rather indicative that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Vermont is the only state to legalize this AND that the state supreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; court decision that mandated the legislature craft such a law used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; typically leftist 'judicial activism' in inventing an interpretation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the state constitution that claimed to read something that was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still doesn't make it a leftist doctrine or issue.  Letting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitimate issues be co-opted by the opposition is surely not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good idea.
</em><br>
<p>Of course not, but there are some libertarian positions that the
<br>
dems/liberals promote, and others that the GOP/conservatives promote.
<br>
Thus, the fact that Vermont, which is documented as the target of an
<br>
organized effort since the 1970's to migrate liberals there in order to
<br>
change the political landscape AND that it is the only state to legalize
<br>
gay marriage (as well as sibling and parent/child 'domestic
<br>
partnerships') AND that gay issues are libertarian ones that generally
<br>
liberals only promote supports my original contention.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Oh, and I forgot, Vermont also has one of the most 'pc' of hate-crime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; laws, where individuals have been convicted and put in jail for simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; using the 'n' word.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really?  Even regardless of race?  How the heck do they justify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putting someone in jail for simply using obnoxious and/or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bigotted language?  True hate-crimes result in people being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously molested and even killed.  Preventing those has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing to do with outlawing words or saying hateful things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I say this as a member of a couple of sub-populations who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have suffered altogther too many real hate-crimes.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I think I've documented this already on the list, of a local case
<br>
where the state hate-crimes law was used by a police officer to
<br>
successfully charge and convict a drunk woman for calling him a nigger
<br>
(he is black). She spent 30 days in jail and paid I think a $1000 fine
<br>
or so.
