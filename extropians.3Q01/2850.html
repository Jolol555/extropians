<p>A Scientist's Art: Computer Fiction
<br>
By KATIE HAFNER
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><p>Robert Burroughs for The New York Times
<br>
THE NOVELIST AS SEERVernor Vinge, a fiction writer and professor emeritus of 
<br>
computer science, in the library at San Diego State University.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
AN DIEGO -- VERNOR VINGE, a computer scientist at San Diego State University, 
<br>
was one of the first not only to understand the power of computer networks 
<br>
but also to paint elaborate scenarios about their effects on society. He has 
<br>
long argued that machine intelligence will someday soon outstrip human 
<br>
intelligence. 
<br>
<p>But Dr. Vinge does not publish technical papers on those topics. He writes 
<br>
science fiction. 
<br>
<p>And in turning computer fact into published fiction, Dr. Vinge (pronounced 
<br>
VIN-jee) has developed a readership so convinced of his prescience that 
<br>
businesses seek his help in envisioning and navigating the decades to come. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Vernor can live, as few can, in the future,&quot; said Lawrence Wilkinson, 
<br>
co-founder of Global Business Network, which specializes in corporate 
<br>
planning. &quot;He can imagine extensions and elaborations on reality that aren't 
<br>
provable, of course, but that are consistent with what we know.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Dr. Vinge's 1992 novel, &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot; (Tor Books), which won the 
<br>
prestigious Hugo Award for science fiction, is a grand &quot;space opera&quot; set 
<br>
40,000 years in a future filled with unfathomable distances, the destruction 
<br>
of entire planetary systems and doglike aliens. A reviewer in The Washington 
<br>
Post (news/quote) called it &quot;a wide-screen science fiction epic of the type 
<br>
few writers attempt any more, probably because nobody until Vinge has ever 
<br>
done it well.&quot; 
<br>
<p>But computers, not aliens, were at the center of the work that put Dr. Vinge 
<br>
on the science fiction map — &quot;True Names,&quot; a 30,000-word novella that offered 
<br>
a vision of a networked world. It was published in 1981, long before most 
<br>
people had heard of the Internet and a year before William Gibson's story 
<br>
&quot;Burning Chrome&quot; coined the term that has come to describe such a world: 
<br>
cyberspace. 
<br>
<p>For years, even as its renown has grown, &quot;True Names&quot; has been out of print 
<br>
and hard to find. Now it is being reissued by Tor Books in &quot;True Names and 
<br>
the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier,&quot; a collection of stories and essays 
<br>
by computer scientists that is due out in December. 
<br>
<p>&quot;True Names&quot; is the tale of Mr. Slippery, a computer vandal who is caught by 
<br>
the government and pressed into service to stop a threat greater than 
<br>
himself. The story portrays a world rife with pseudonymous characters and 
<br>
other elements of online life that now seem almost ho-hum. In retrospect, it 
<br>
was prophetic. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The import of `True Names,' &quot; wrote Marvin Minsky, a pioneer in artificial 
<br>
intelligence, in an afterword to an early edition of the work, &quot;is that it is 
<br>
about how we cope with things we don't understand.&quot;
<br>
<p>And computers are at the center of Dr. Vinge's vision of the challenges that 
<br>
the coming decades will bring. A linchpin of his thinking is what he calls 
<br>
the &quot;technological singularity,&quot; a point at which the intelligence of 
<br>
machines takes a huge leap, and they come to possess capabilities that exceed 
<br>
those of humans. As a result, ultra- intelligent machines become capable of 
<br>
upgrading themselves, humans cease to be the primary players, and the future 
<br>
becomes unknowable. 
<br>
<p>Dr. Vinge sees the singularity as probable if not inevitable, most likely 
<br>
arriving between 2020 and 2040. 
<br>
<p>Indeed, any conversation with Dr. Vinge, 56, inevitably turns to the 
<br>
singularity. It is a preoccupation he recognizes with self-effacing humor as 
<br>
&quot;my usual shtick.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Although he has written extensively about the singularity as a scientific 
<br>
concept, he is humble about laying intellectual claim to it. In fact, with 
<br>
titles like &quot;Approximation by Faber Polynomials for a Class of Jordan 
<br>
Domains&quot; and &quot;Teaching FORTH on a VAX,&quot; Dr. Vinge's academic papers bear 
<br>
little resemblance to the topics he chooses for his fiction. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The ideas about the singularity and the future of computation are things 
<br>
that basically occurred to me on the basis of my experience of what I know 
<br>
about computers,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>&quot;And although that is at a professional level, it's not because of some great 
<br>
research insight I had or even a not-so-great research insight I had. It's 
<br>
because I've been watching these things and I like to think about where 
<br>
things could go.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Dr. Vinge readily concedes that his worldview has been shaped by science 
<br>
fiction, which he has been reading and writing since childhood. His dream, he 
<br>
said, was to be a scientist, and &quot;the science fiction was just part of the 
<br>
dreaming.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Trained as a mathematician, Dr. Vinge said he did not begin &quot;playing with 
<br>
real computers&quot; until the early 1970's, after he had started teaching at San 
<br>
Diego State. His teaching gradually shifted to computer science, focusing on 
<br>
computer networks and distributed systems. He received tenure in 1977. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Teaching networks and operating systems was a constant source of story 
<br>
inspiration,&quot; Dr. Vinge said. The idea for &quot;True Names&quot; came from an exchange 
<br>
he had one day in the late 1970's while using an early form of instant 
<br>
messaging called Talk. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Suddenly I was accosted by another user via the Talk program,&quot; he recalled. 
<br>
&quot;We chatted briefly, each trying to figure out the other's true name. Finally 
<br>
I gave up and told the other person I had to go — that I was actually a 
<br>
personality simulator, and if I kept talking, my artificial nature would 
<br>
become obvious. Afterwards I realized that I had just lived a science fiction 
<br>
story.&quot;
<br>
<p>Computers and artificial intelligence are, of course, at the center of much 
<br>
science fiction, including the current Steven Spielberg film, &quot;A.I.&quot; In the 
<br>
Spielberg vision, a robotic boy achieves a different sort of singularity: 
<br>
parity with humans not just in intelligence but in emotion, too. &quot;To me, the 
<br>
big leap of faith is to make that little boy,&quot; Dr. Vinge said. &quot;We don't have 
<br>
evidence of progress toward that. If it ever happens, there will be a runaway 
<br>
effect, and getting to something a whole lot better than human will happen 
<br>
really fast.&quot; 
<br>
<p>How fast? &quot;Maybe 36 hours,&quot; Dr. Vinge replied. 
<br>
<p>Dr. Vinge's own work has yet to make it to the screen, although &quot;True Names&quot; 
<br>
has been under option for five years. &quot;It's been a long story of my trying to 
<br>
convince studio executives to really consider the work seriously because it 
<br>
seemed so far out,&quot; said David Baxter, a Hollywood writer and producer who is 
<br>
writing the screenplay with Mark Pesce, co-creator of Virtual Reality 
<br>
Modeling Language, or VRML. &quot;But as time has passed, the world has started to 
<br>
match what was in the book.&quot; 
<br>
<p>In the meantime Dr. Vinge has been providing scenarios in the corporate world 
<br>
as well. He is one of several science fiction writers who have worked with 
<br>
Global Business Network in anticipating future situations and plotting 
<br>
strategies for several major companies. 
<br>
<p>Mr. Wilkinson, the co-founder of Global Business Network, said that Dr. 
<br>
Vinge's work with the group provided &quot;an unbelievably fertile perspective 
<br>
from which to look back at and reunderstand the present.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;It's that ability to conceptualize whole new ways of framing issues, whole 
<br>
new contexts that could emerge,&quot; Mr. Wilkinson said. &quot;In the process he has 
<br>
contributed to the turnarounds of at least two well-known technology 
<br>
companies.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Dr. Vinge, shy and reserved, is hardly a self-promoter. He scrupulously 
<br>
assigns credit to others whenever he can. And although he insists that much 
<br>
of his work is highly derivative, his fans do not necessarily share that 
<br>
view. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The thing that distinguishes Vernor is he's a scientist and all of his stuff 
<br>
makes sense,&quot; Mr. Baxter said. &quot;It's all grounded in the here and now.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Dr. Vinge is now a professor emeritus at San Diego State, having retired to 
<br>
devote his time to his writing and consulting. Over lunch at a restaurant not 
<br>
far from the university, he described a story he was working on. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Well, there's a recovering Alzheimer's patient,&quot; Dr. Vinge began, before 
<br>
being interrupted and asked how one could be a recovering Alzheimer's 
<br>
patient. 
<br>
<p>His eyes brightened. &quot;You can't,&quot; he said, and a sly smile crossed his face. 
<br>
&quot;Yet
