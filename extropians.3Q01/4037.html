<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; How reliable are the &quot;HIV tests?&quot; (I've seen claims that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; there are more than 60 conditions or diseases that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; cause false positives...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; ACTORS KNOWN TO CAUSE FALSE POSITIVE
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;HIV ANTIBODY TEST RESULTS
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;[...snip a very long list...]
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The problem is that the tests look for an immune response
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather than for the viruses themselves...
</em><br>
<p>As I understand it, it is expensive and time-consuming to actually isolate the
<br>
virus from every patients blood, so instead surrogate markers for the virus are
<br>
used for screening.
<br>
<p>As long as the virus sample has first been properly isolated to a purity
<br>
sufficient to ensure that the proteins or genetic material to be used as
<br>
surrogate markers were extracted from that virus, and as long as the resulting
<br>
tests constructed using these markers are tested and calibrated against the
<br>
&quot;gold standard&quot; [viral isolation], then these tests can be useful diagnostic
<br>
tools.
<br>
<p>No, the Perth Group [views summarized at
<br>
<a href="http://www.mmsweb.com/eykiw/aids/aids.htm">http://www.mmsweb.com/eykiw/aids/aids.htm</a> and
<br>
<a href="http://www.virusmyth.net/aids/perthgroup/index.html">http://www.virusmyth.net/aids/perthgroup/index.html</a>] argue that the problem with
<br>
these tests are that this virus was never properly isolated, and that it is
<br>
therefore incorrect to label the proteins and genetic material extracted from
<br>
the sample and used in the tests as being a marker for infection with a virus.
<br>
<p>If you don't have a pure viral isolate, then it will be a case of garbage in =
<br>
garbage out no matter how fancy your lab techniques get.
<br>
<p>Several of the Perth Groups points seem compelling to me.
<br>
<p>1)  In 1983 Luc Montagnier’s group at the Pasteur Institute claimed they had
<br>
isolated a virus from cultures obtained from patients at risk for AIDS, banded
<br>
it in density gradients, and that this band consisted of purified virus.(1)
<br>
<p>However, neither Montagnier’s group nor anybody else published electron
<br>
micrographs of this band showing that it contained only objects with the
<br>
characteristics of viral particles. When Montagnier was asked in July 1997 by
<br>
French Journalist Djamel Tahi why such photos were not published, his answer was
<br>
because, even after &quot;Roman effort&quot;, they could see no particles with &quot;morphology
<br>
typical of retroviruses… I repeat we did not purify...&quot;(2)
<br>
<p>(2) Also in 1997 the leading science journal Virology published two papers that
<br>
provided stunning new data on the “isolation” of HIV.(3)(4)  For the first time,
<br>
electron microscope images of “HIV” banded at the density required for
<br>
retroviruses were published. They revealed &quot;major contaminants&quot; in &quot;pure HIV&quot;,
<br>
consisting of an excess of vesicles - particles of cellular proteins. [See the
<br>
photos for yourself at <a href="http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/award.htm">http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/award.htm</a>]
<br>
<p>The samples Montagnier [and later Robert Gallo of the NIH] called &quot;viral
<br>
isolates” contain a few objects that resemble retroviruses (the &quot;HIV&quot;) plus lots
<br>
of other things, which clearly aren't viruses. Without a pure isolate of
<br>
virus-like particles,  there is no way to extract proteins and genetic material
<br>
out of a molecular soup and know that they came from one group of particular
<br>
looking objects rather than another.
<br>
<p>(3) Montagnier and Gallo claimed “isolation” citing three pieces of evidence:
<br>
detection of reverse transcription activity, detection of retroviral-like
<br>
particles in cell cultures, and antibody reactions. The Perth Group argues these
<br>
are logically insufficient:
<br>
<p>First, reverse transcription activity is not unique to retroviruses, and in fact
<br>
RT activity in normal cells is promoted by the very conditions which Montagnier
<br>
and Gallo subjected their patients’ T-cells to.(5)  Therefore, detection of RT
<br>
activity in these cultures was not proof that there was a retrovirus present.
<br>
<p>Secondly, Gallo and Montagnier offered as evidence photographs of particles in
<br>
impure cell cultures and asserted that not only were they retroviruses, but they
<br>
were a specific retrovirus, “HIV.”  However, as even Gallo admits,(6)
<br>
retroviral-like particles that are not infectious are common in cultures,
<br>
especially those subjected to the conditions that Gallo and Montagnier used in
<br>
order to cultivate “HIV.” Pointing to particles in impure cell cultures that are
<br>
viral-like was hardly proof that those particles were a retrovirus, let alone a
<br>
specific retrovirus, “HIV.”
<br>
<p>Thirdly, Gallo and Montagnier offered antibody reactions as proof of  isolation
<br>
of their virus from AIDS patients. They identified certain proteins in these
<br>
cultures as “HIV proteins.” This was done not by extracting those proteins from
<br>
the viral isolate, because there was no viral isolate.  They had a soup
<br>
containing a few virus-like objects and a lot of contaminating cellular debris.
<br>
<p>To decide which proteins extracted from this mix were from the virus-like
<br>
objects, they exposed the proteins to blood samples from both AIDS patients and
<br>
non-AIDS patients.  If a protein caused an antibody response from an AIDS
<br>
patient, and no antibody response from a non-AIDS patient, they said that one
<br>
was an “HIV protein.” These proteins were then used in the antibody and Western
<br>
Blot tests.  A Positive result is interpreted as indicating the presence of “HIV
<br>
antibodies.”
<br>
<p>However, antibodies cross-react, and AIDS patients have a much higher level of
<br>
circulating antibodies than in normal, healthy individuals. Thus AIDS patients
<br>
were likely to have antibody cross-reactions with any given protein more often
<br>
than non-AIDS patients. Also, false positives may be caused by vaccinations
<br>
against other diseases or current or past diseases.(7)  Moreover, antibodies can
<br>
be raised against a non-viral protein, e.g. that of endogenous nature (arising
<br>
from within, not from infection). Identification of certain proteins as “HIV
<br>
proteins,” simply because they reacted with antibodies of AIDS patients and not
<br>
non-AIDS patients was insufficient proof that these proteins were actually from
<br>
a new virus, “HIV.”
<br>
<p>The insufficiency of this evidence was first pointed out by Eleni
<br>
Papadopulos-Eleopulos, a medical physicist at Australia's Royal Perth Hospital.
<br>
In 1988 she published her paper, &quot;Reappraisal of AIDS: Is the Oxidation Induced
<br>
by the Risk Factors the Primary Cause?&quot;, in which she stated, &quot;Unlike other
<br>
viruses [HIV] has never been isolated as an independent stable particle.&quot;(8)
<br>
With the recent release of the photos showing no viral isolation, and
<br>
Montagnier’s admission that “…we did not purify”, it is hard to deny the logic
<br>
of her argument.
<br>
<p>The inability to isolate the virus means no proteins which are viral and free
<br>
from contaminants have ever been obtained, thus no one can be certain what the
<br>
antibodies are that bind to the proteins. This is the heart of the problem
<br>
facing all HIV tests. The manufacturer of the most popular HIV test kit openly
<br>
acknowledges, &quot;there is no recognized standard for establishing the presence or
<br>
absence of antibodies to HIV in human blood.&quot;(9)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is why Chiron's (CHIR) Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;platform (Procleix), which is expected to receive FDA approved later
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this year is a considered to be a major advancement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Chiron's NAT technology will be the first general purpose platform
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that is capable of directly detecting the presence of viruses in the body.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So that sort of answers your question.  NAT should effectively eliminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;false positives AND false negatives for HIV (and other viruses) in the body.
</em><br>
<p>I found some press releases from Chiron online
<br>
[<a href="http://www.gen-probe.com/press031201.html">http://www.gen-probe.com/press031201.html</a>] that describe this NAT to be some
<br>
sort of a nucleic acid amplification test.  Maybe I am mistaken.  However, IF
<br>
HIV was never isoated, then how is it possible to consider the RNAs used
<br>
represents the genome of a unique retrovirus and to use these as probes and
<br>
primers for hybridisation, PCR or NAT tests to prove infection with this virus
<br>
and in fact to measure the viral load?
<br>
<p>If no virus has been isolated, it follows that no nucleic acid has been isolated
<br>
from it either. Virologist Dr Stefan Lanka has described the complicated
<br>
procedures at the end of which something is produced which is called the nucleic
<br>
acid of HIV.
<br>
<p>[begin quote]
<br>
<p>1. In a tube....
<br>
<p>HIV and its DNA can allegedly be made by the &quot;bucketful&quot;,(24) but under very
<br>
surprising conditions which, inter alia, entail the use of extracts from plants
<br>
and other oxidising chemicals, which could not possibly exist in vivo.
<br>
Immortalised cell lines devised (and later patented) by the Montagnier and Gallo
<br>
groups are co-cultured with extracts from human cells or the cells themselves.
<br>
At the end of it all HIV itself is not actually obtained only reverse
<br>
transcriptase activity is shown to occur which is taken to imply
<br>
that the DNA that is found, must have been viral in origin.
<br>
<p>The real explanation of what happens is as follows. In the mixture of cell
<br>
cultures and stressed human cells, RNA and reverse transcriptase come to be
<br>
produced in large amounts, because the cells have been specially selected and
<br>
treated to do this. The RNA is transcribed into DNA by reverse transcriptase,
<br>
and long pieces of DNA are produced which are said to be viral DNA. In fact they
<br>
are composed of unrelated pieces of expressed cellular RNA, transcribed into DNA
<br>
and linked together by a  process of &quot;template switching&quot; (a well-characterised
<br>
property of reverse transcriptase).(25) This misleads ordinary researchers into
<br>
believing that they have actually produced viral DNA. It is said that this
<br>
linear DNA is the free or the non-integrated form of HIV, which furthermore is
<br>
said to be a unique feature of HIV, because a lot of detectable free linear DNA
<br>
has not been suggested in any other models of retroviruses.
<br>
<p>2. Through selecting processes....
<br>
<p>The resulting pieces of DNA too, are necessarily both shorter and longer than
<br>
the &quot;correct&quot; length of HIV. Pieces corresponding to the &quot;correct&quot; length of HIV
<br>
must be selected for size, because otherwise the purported DNA preparation would
<br>
be a mixture of various lengths, which would violate a cardinal rule of virology
<br>
that all nucleic acid of a particular virus be identical in size.
<br>
<p>3. Through a detecting process....
<br>
<p>Having artificially prepared DNA pieces of uniform length, they are still not
<br>
ready for presentation, because they consist of a mixture of all kinds of RNA
<br>
fragments transcribed into DNA and thus cannot be shown to represent unique
<br>
viral DNA. Accordingly, the mixture is subjected to a kind of key-and-lock
<br>
detection process called hybridisation, whereby pieces of DNA
<br>
are detected which complement more or less a probe of that which it is desired
<br>
to be shown to have been prepared.
<br>
<p>4. Choosing a desired probe....
<br>
<p>Since no DNA from HIV existed to hybridise with the prepared DNA, Gallo and
<br>
Montagnier simply used stretches of DNA from what they said was specific to
<br>
HTLV-I, a retrovirus Gallo had earlier claimed to have discovered, and which
<br>
they deemed suitable for this purpose. The DNA detected in this way was
<br>
replicated and certain stretches of it cloned and declared to be the DNA of
<br>
HTLV-III (later to be called HIV).
<br>
<p>To summarise, the purpose of the exercise is to grow HIV, but it actually
<br>
produces a mixture of different lengths of DNA, contrary to theory which says
<br>
they should all be identical, and no virus at all. It is then claimed that the
<br>
&quot;correct&quot; DNA has been prepared by finding certain strands in this heterogeneous
<br>
mix by hybridising them with an HTLV-I DNA probe whose sequence is known and
<br>
defined also to be HIV. However, non-hybridising strands of DNA should not be
<br>
there at all, and the fact that they are, proves that a complete rag-bag of DNA
<br>
has been prepared, without any indication of what it is made up of.
<br>
<p>It follows that &quot;HIV&quot; DNA must just be a laboratory artefact constructed to a
<br>
preconceived idea of what retroviral DNA should be, and this assessment does not
<br>
even raise the question why no virus can be obtained, whatever the experimental
<br>
conditions.
<br>
<p>Gallo and Montagnier's cloned HIV DNA
<br>
<p>One cannot help asking why no-one had not long ago spotted the flaw in the
<br>
techniques employed by the Gallo and Montagnier groups. After defining some
<br>
segments of DNA to be &quot;HIV&quot;-specific, every researcher in the field worked
<br>
exclusively with short, cloned sequences (never the whole strand) on the
<br>
reasonable assumption that the original characterisation had been correctly
<br>
performed. From the isolation and identification procedure described above, it
<br>
follows that the resultant sequences vary widely from one preparation to the
<br>
next, which sequence analysts misinterpreted as the legendary capacity of HIV to
<br>
mutate.

<br>
<p>There are many Human Endogenous Retrovirus (HERV) sequences in the human genome,
<br>
thus in all of us (10).
<br>
<p>They are there already, we don't acquire them by infection.  For that reason, I
<br>
have always thought it confusing to call these sequences &quot;virus&quot; in the first
<br>
place.
<br>
<p>In 1997 some researchers found evidence that sequences specific for the
<br>
&quot;hepatitis C virus&quot; are demonstrable in the DNA fraction of peripheral blood
<br>
mononuclear cells from healthy, anti-HCV antibody-negative individuals and cell
<br>
lines of human origin (11).  A similar finding has been announced concerning
<br>
&quot;HIV&quot;. (12)
<br>
<p>All of us have retroviral sequences in our genes that can be expressed under
<br>
certain circumstances. In the case of &quot;HIV&quot;, the Perth Group argues that our
<br>
bodies, and cultures in labs, can be exposed to oxidative or other stress that
<br>
cause these sequences to &quot;be activated&quot; or express proteins.  It is argued these
<br>
phenomenon are the result of, not the cause of, disease.
