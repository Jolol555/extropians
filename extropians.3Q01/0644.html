<p>As far as I can see there is no absolute answer to this... (except to say 
<br>
that there no longer is a unique you... there are now two of them).
<br>
<p>Even undergoing the procedure will not tell you.
<br>
<p>It is like asking if the person you meet and talk with in the street is 
<br>
conscious or an automaton. There can be no really absolute answer, but you 
<br>
can be practical and accept that they are conscious.
<br>
<p>If I was backed-up and the backup activated, I would be perfectly happy 
<br>
that there were two of me. Of course after the point of activation we would 
<br>
begin diverging slightly in identity. For this reason continuity problems 
<br>
are largely avoided by activating the backup after death of the biological one.
<br>
<p>If my biologically-based mind was dying I would be relieved that the other 
<br>
me would continue... even if the backup had been activated some time before 
<br>
the biological death, but that is just my personal feeling.
<br>
<p>It is largely subjective and to do with practicality.
<br>
<p>For those who would argue that the backup was a totally separate identity, 
<br>
I would suggest a little thought experiment: go back in time to yesterday 
<br>
and try to convince the other you which one is the &quot;real&quot; one.
<br>
<p>What? They are both the same you? Surely not. :-) Put yourself in the place 
<br>
of the younger one with this other person trying to convince you that they 
<br>
are really you. It doesn't feel quite right does it? The older one has 
<br>
memories that you don't. You can be open to reason though and accept that 
<br>
there is a connection. But if you can accept that, then I don't see the 
<br>
problem in accepting that a backup is you also. Both examples are connected 
<br>
by information. In one information is copied through time, and in the other 
<br>
it is copied through space.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
