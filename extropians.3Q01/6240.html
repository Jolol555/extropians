<br>
<p>There's a basic question I'm surprised no one has posted before: 
<br>
Do we know that our friends -- extropians, cryonicists,
<br>
transhumanists, etc. -- in DC and NY are safe?
<br>
I'm particularly concerned about Perry Metzger, who could
<br>
reasonably have  been in the World Trade Center yesterday.
<br>
<p>Subscribe to the exi-freedom list, we've known since yesterday that
<br>
Perry was safe.
<br>
<p><p>Hope Perry doesn't mind:

<em>&gt;&gt; I'm still trying to get hold of Perry Metzger in New York
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to see if he's OK.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; There are still planes unaccounted for.  Bastards.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm fine. One friend of mine was unaccounted for, but appears to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have survived the destruction of his home/office, as did his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;girlfriend. My friends working across the street also survived.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The collapse of the buildings was viewed by my staff. By the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I got here, all that was left was a giant cloud. I struggled into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the office -- we're on 14th street, on the edge of the area that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has been closed off.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Anyone in NYC or nearby should please go and donate blood. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;desperately short here. There are ambulances still going by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;door constantly.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The purpose of terrorism is to disrupt and destroy. We all owe it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the dead to continue working and continue building.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;BTW, what is the &quot;exi-freedom&quot; mailing list? I was previously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unaware of it.
