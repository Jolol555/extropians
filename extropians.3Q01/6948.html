</em><br>
<p>I agree wholeheartedly that we need to seriously discuss some issues here.
<br>
One of the things that irks me is this notion that a human life is a sacred
<br>
thing of absolute moral worth, which has been brought up in this thread in
<br>
particular, which I find entirely *opposed* to transhumanism.  Fostering a
<br>
culture that has as its prime value the absolute sanctity of *human* life is
<br>
not, in my opinion, the smart thing for us to do.  It's almost a kind of
<br>
vitalism; there's some special 'essence' that gives humans worth but we have
<br>
no definition of what it is.  The one definition (or reason, excuse) we
<br>
often do accept I find naive: the idea that by fostering a culture that has
<br>
as its prime value the absolute sanctity of human life I increase my chances
<br>
of survival.  This embodies the second part of current (apparent) Extropian
<br>
thought that I find irksome: this &quot;black box&quot; view of the human mind as
<br>
something almost non-physical, indivisable (for want of a better word), and
<br>
capable of a kind of omniscient decision making tempered only by input.  You
<br>
see it on this list all the time; from the idea that we can drop books on
<br>
peoples heads and they'll immediately become rational thinkers to the
<br>
defence of individualism and the primacy of survival as self-evident.
<br>
<p>Both of these concepts I find lacking.  In the first case, this irrational
<br>
championing of humanity will come back to bite us when we or our progeny are
<br>
no longer in human form *unless* we define this property that humans have
<br>
that makes them so special in explicit and non-human terms.  It is
<br>
especially not enough to say &quot;I am human therefore human is good,&quot; I hope
<br>
that we can be more forward thinking than that.  In the second case, we
<br>
don't know a great deal about the brain but we *do* know enough to
<br>
re-evaluate how we think of ourselves and others.  We need to start
<br>
realising that it's not a black box with input and output and inside 'we'
<br>
sit pulling levers (or whatever it is the traditional view supposes goes on
<br>
in there), it's full of crap that isn't particularly geared to being a
<br>
rational and enlightened thinker.  We know this already, of course, because
<br>
we talk about it endlessly in our discussions of future technology and
<br>
evolutionary psychology but as soon as we start talking ethics or philosophy
<br>
or politics we more often than not revert to outmoded thinking.  &quot;I&quot; and
<br>
&quot;you&quot; are suitcase terms of the highest-order; we need to know *exactly*
<br>
what it is we're attempting to preserve and expand upon.
<br>
<p>I have more to say but I'll leave it at this for now.
<br>
