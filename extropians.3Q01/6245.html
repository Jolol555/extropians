<p>No one is talking about any one DESERVING any thing, well am not anyway.
<br>
I am surprised to hear that kind of reductionist rationalizing here. I have 
<br>
gone
<br>
to great pains in all my posts to make the point that the issues i outline are
<br>
no EXCUSE for the events of Tuesday.
<br>
However i don't see ignoring the elements that have contributed to the 
<br>
events, as
<br>
very constructive.
<br>
If we can't discuss ALL the issues even when ppl tip toe around to prevent 
<br>
giving offence
<br>
then what is the point.
<br>
<p>Bah ...... now i have to look up my sources BRB :)
<br>
<p>Contributory factors under US control:-
<br>
<p>(A)
<br>
The fact that Ben Laden was trained by the CIA in the first place. Huge 
<br>
home goal
<br>
not the first remember Ho Chi Minh, and Noreaga, and there are others.
<br>
This also happens with Nations US policy supports Countries who can be used to
<br>
achieve convenient foreign policy goals. Like covertly supporting Iraq in 
<br>
it's war against
<br>
Iran. Think i've made my point on this one.
<br>
<p>(B)
<br>
Blindly supporting Israel no matter what, look over this list and tell me 
<br>
that at least a
<br>
few are not justified.
<br>
<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ia/palestinefoever/UNresolutions.html">http://www.angelfire.com/ia/palestinefoever/UNresolutions.html</a>
<br>
Even if you take the view that the UN ( over the period covered )
<br>
was controlled entirely by Arabs and Soviets which is absurd. I find it 
<br>
hard to ignore
<br>
so many resolutions.
<br>
Despite all this violations the US has rarely made any kind of criticisms 
<br>
of Israel's policy.
<br>
Seven of the resolutions concern Geneva convention violations !
<br>
Just to make the point i am NOT any kind of Anti-Semite.
<br>
IMHO America supports Israel for some of the reasons it supported Iraq 
<br>
against Iran. Because
<br>
it is politically expedient to do so, nothing to do with fairness or balance.
<br>
<p>(C)
<br>
This one is a matter of opinion, one which i think has been tragically born 
<br>
out by recent events.
<br>
Primarily that successive US administrations have taken what i call the 
<br>
&quot;World Sheriff&quot; foreign
<br>
policy perspective. Being willing to essential bully and threaten other 
<br>
nations into compliance
<br>
with US desires. Now some of the policies pursued have be to every ones 
<br>
benefit and completely
<br>
reasonable.
<br>
However it does not take a genius to work out how a tactic of coercion 
<br>
generated long standing
<br>
bad feeling and hatred within some of those nations.
<br>
I am NOT anti-American some US foreign policy however is badly flawed.
<br>
<p>I think this gives us a few points to discuss, and please lets keep this a 
<br>
discussion, the only reason i raise
<br>
these issues is because imho i see one of the most interesting and dynamic 
<br>
cultures on the planet making
<br>
some huge mistakes. And i am baffle by the apparent lack of perspective on 
<br>
them.
