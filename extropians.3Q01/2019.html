<p>I assumed he meant the RB could be reflective.  But actually
<br>
the Space Based Laser and Airborne Laser are designed for
<br>
hitting the launch vehicles in the boost phase, not primarily
<br>
for hitting reentry bodies after MIRV.  The launcher is still in
<br>
the boost phase after they are above most of the atmosphere,
<br>
so I doubt that clouds and haze will be that much of an issue.
<br>
<p>It may shock John Clark, but I am not that big a fan of either
<br>
laser system.  Altho I believe them to be workable, I rather
<br>
doubt that either system will ever be deployed, or if so probably
<br>
not in the next 20 years.  It intrigues me that the SBL could be
<br>
used theoretically to push light sails to high speeds for interstellar
<br>
travel.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How many shots can you fire, and how many of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Agreed it would take a lot of orbitters.  It would be an expensive
<br>
system, which is why I believe it will not be deployed, or if so,
<br>
not until launching stuff gets cheaper.  I suspect before it is
<br>
over we will do the interceptors and let it go at that.  The
<br>
lives saved per dollar for SBL is lower than interceptors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And how does this apply to civilian aircraft on a regular flight, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens to have some extra cargo onboard? Or a parked van? Or a rented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suite in a highrise?
</em><br>
<p>Heres where the whole ABM discussion went last time, which
<br>
was about a year ago.  We argued whether or not it could be
<br>
done, then whether or not it should be, etc, just like this time.
<br>
Then someone brought up the inevitable question of suitcase
<br>
nukes and their many equivalents.  Seems to me it all goes back
<br>
to the issue of... transparency!
<br>
<p>Reasoning: we can likely eventually defeat the weapons in the
<br>
world's arsenals today.  Newer and better ones will be developed,
<br>
and we may be able to defeat even those eventually.  But when it
<br>
is all said and done, if we are ever to be safe from suitcase nukes,
<br>
we need another level of technology to do exactly what many of us
<br>
have agreed we dont want: one that will watch everyone always, and
<br>
blow the whistle if someone tries to make a suitcase nuke, or
<br>
perhaps make a fertilizer/diesel bomb, etc.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, I have made my views on transparency known: that
<br>
I care nothing about *my own* privacy, but I also recognize that
<br>
there are very legitimate reasons for privacy.  Currently I am
<br>
open to suggestion.
<br>
<p>I am intrigued by what Bush and Putin are up to today.  spike
