most of the stable ones being relatively complex compounds.  Acetone

peroxide is well-known for a DIY primary, but not exactly the poster child

for quality explosives work.  If I was going to use a peroxide
<br>
primary/detonator, I'd be using HMTD instead.  (HMTD is the only organic
<br>
peroxide that I know of that was sufficiently non-reactive and interesting
<br>
that it has seen commercial application.  It is a superb primary for
<br>
applications that require highly optimal detonator performance.  The funny
<br>
thing is, that the ingredients for HMTD are so innocuous that you really
<br>
*can* buy them at the store.)  Of course, one of the practical problems with
<br>
organic peroxides is they tend to react with the things they are in contact
<br>
with, which generally neutralizes the explosive properties in surprisingly
<br>
short order.  Organic peroxides can be used effectively, but they take a
<br>
real chemistry pro to do right.

<p><p>Actually, akali metals have explosive reactions with a broad range of simple
<br>
hydrocarbon halides, with differing primary and secondary effects depending
<br>
on the compound used.  Virtually all methyl halides work quite well.  These
<br>
are the easiest and most reliable ones I know; for some other metals, the
<br>
results are often less predictable.
<br>
<p>In organo-metallic compound synthesis, it is generally a bad idea to
<br>
blithely use elemental metals unless you know exactly what you are doing.
<br>
Some reactions are specific to a single kind of elemental metal, others to a
<br>
number of elemental metals.  All the usual culprits that are commonly used
<br>
for catalytic work are likely candidates (e.g. mercury and copper).
<br>
Sometimes the bad reaction only occurs if the reagent falls outside certain
<br>
narrow temperature guidelines (this happens in general organic chemistry as
<br>
well -- a minor change in reaction temperature can send you down a
<br>
different, possibly less pleasant, pathway).  I know of a couple specific
<br>
examples for non-alkali metals, but a competent googlist could track down
<br>
the details.  Metal-organic explosive reactions are admittedly something I
<br>
am only weakly acquainted with.
<br>
<p>And then there are the metal-metal explosives, some of which have seen
<br>
commercial application.  There is no gas generated, but the energy release
<br>
is phenomenal and the nature of it gives the explosion special properties.
<br>
The problem with these is that it usually takes a substantially electrical
<br>
kick to get things rolling, and the most favored metal combinations are
<br>
often quite expensive.
