<p>Ron, please use text only in your messages, so I can quote properly.
<br>
<p>You are correct in your assessment. The purpose of the rioting is to
<br>
force the G8 countries to impose martial law-like conditions any time
<br>
the leadership meets, so that the 5th ComIntern and its subsidiaries can
<br>
claim that they are fascists and oppressors who are not interested in
<br>
the rights of the people, etc etc etc. The 'non-violent' groups are
<br>
there just to add numbers for PR purposes, the real shock troops are the
<br>
'Black Bloc' which dart in and out of the crowd, attempting to piss off
<br>
the police enough to trigger atrocities.
<br>
<p>Another effect of these riots is to annoy the local residents enough
<br>
that they pass permanent local regs curbing rights to demonstrate, etc.
<br>
and trained the police to be far less tolerant of the brats who make up
<br>
the protest groups. This creates a vicious cycle of oppression and
<br>
dissilusionment that helps feed more membership into revolutionary
<br>
groups and generates more individuals willing to commit more extreme
<br>
acts, which foster greater repression, etc. Eventually, the countries of
<br>
the world will choose to impose an international police state that the
<br>
collectivists in the NGO groups at the UN will control.
<br>
<p><p>----------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;Remember that some of these anarchists are from middle class
<br>
backgrounds
<br>
and consider these activities to be a part-time political activity,
<br>
taking
<br>
time off work to travel to the various summits. In the past, such
<br>
far-left
<br>
recruits to revolutionary movements have travelled across the spectrum
<br>
of
<br>
political activism towards terrorism.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It is possible that the death of a protestor in Genoa could be viewed
<br>
as by
<br>
anarchists as a declaration of war by the 'capitalist hegemony' to
<br>
oppress
<br>
the them. They may revert to the time honoured traditions of their
<br>
predecessors - bombing and assassinating what they consider to be
<br>
legitimate
<br>
targets.
<br>
<p>Given the anti-scientific ideologies that motivate many of these groups,
<br>
will they consider laboratories and scientists as their targets?
