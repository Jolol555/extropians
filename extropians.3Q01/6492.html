<em>&gt; Thanks for the interesting essay. Suppose we accept your analysis of the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; enlightenment in the middle east. I am not sure how you propose to get from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;here to there&quot;. You suggest that we take Japan as the poster child for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of transformation that we would like to see, but of course the changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Japan were instituted by a foreign military dictatorship. If the parallel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to hold, western forces would have to institute a military dictatorship,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least for a while.
</em><br>
<p>Isn't that taking the analogy too far, and missing out what the real
<br>
point is? The goal is a new enlightenment (and not just in islamic
<br>
nations, preferably also here in the west!), we have to select ways
<br>
towards this goal that fit with reality. Unless the US invades
<br>
Afghanistan or something similar, dictatorships are obviously out of
<br>
question. But what about pressuring for democracy? What about giving
<br>
support to the free press and pro-democratic groups across the middle
<br>
east? What about opening a dialogue with islamic scholars (whose views
<br>
often have far greater impact on culture and policy in their countries
<br>
than our scholars could ever hope to achieve)? What about removing trade
<br>
tariffs against such nations? There are a lot of different options here. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In effect, I think you are saying that we know best what is best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for them. (If not this only exacerbates the problem). You might even be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right about this, but still there is the problem of instituting what we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think is best for them. After all, saying that they are ignorant in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect is part of what they do not like about the west in the first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any thoughts and getting from here to there? Mark
</em><br>
<p>Charlie's article was unashamedly universalistic: it claimed it is good
<br>
to live in a free, open society where human rights are respected. This
<br>
is an opinion that is seldom heard today, but I think it should be
<br>
supported. Empirical evidence show that open societies work, become
<br>
prosperous, free and fairly safe, and beside this they have a solid
<br>
philosophical foundation that doesn't necessarily have to contradict any
<br>
religion (as well as they are compatible, no, nearly indispensable for
<br>
transhumansm).
<br>
<p>In our postmodern culture such universalism is viewed with scepticism:
<br>
who am I to declare what is good for others? The realisation that other
<br>
cultures may have valid points is often extrapolated to the incorrect
<br>
idea that all expressions of all cultures are equally valid. Even if
<br>
this ridiculous extreme is not accepted, many think that it is wrong to
<br>
not just impose ones own values onto another culture by force, but also
<br>
that it is wrong to impose it - even without deliberation - by exposure
<br>
or non-coercive means such as trade. This is the foundation for much of
<br>
the resistance in Europe agains &quot;American cultural imperialism&quot; -
<br>
Starbucks and Euro-Disney are seen by some intellectuals as an act of
<br>
cultural &quot;war&quot; (my quotation marks, not theirs). 
<br>
<p>But cultures have always interacted. Ideas spread, customs mix and
<br>
structures are challenged. We should be happy about the creolization
<br>
that have brought forth greek philosophy, hellenism, indian art, the
<br>
netherlands, the US and rock music. Trying to keep a culture static and
<br>
untainted by outside influences is equivalent to killing it by freezing.
<br>
We should not try to impose our values with force on other cultures -
<br>
that never works - but we should show them the best
<br>
ideas/things/institutions we have achived, why they work, how they work
<br>
and invite them to do better. The Japanese understood this long before
<br>
WW II - it might have taken them a gunboat to start the process simply
<br>
by showing them what they had missed, but soon it had its own momentum
<br>
when they realized that they could learn and make something good out of
<br>
what they learned.
