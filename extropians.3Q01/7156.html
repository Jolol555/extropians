<em>&gt;We're getting a lot of stuff forwarded here lately. It's interesting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;read the varied perspectives, but much of it is of questionable quality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I wish people would add some commentary or something to put it into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perspective. It was very helpful to learn that that one paranoid guy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was a believer in UFOs.
</em><br>
<p>Sadly, I've been having problems with my ISP, so I've not been able to more
<br>
actively participate here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I looked at this Chronicles magazine website. It is published by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religious, right-wing, Christian think tank. They appear to be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hostile to Islam. I gather from the quoted article that they objected
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the U.S. support for Muslims and opposition to the Serbs in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Balkan conflict.
</em><br>
<p>They are, though does this preclude them from knowing something or having a
<br>
valid perspective?  I think not.  For instance, the piece I sent that you're
<br>
commenting on makes the following:
<br>
<p>1.  The CIA supported Osama bin Laden during the 1980s (to help the Aghanis
<br>
rebel against the Soviets).
<br>
<p>2.  Osama bin Laden supplied weapons to Muslims in the Balkans in the early
<br>
1990s.
<br>
<p>3.  Osama bin Laden issued 'a communiqué in August 1998 listing Serbia among
<br>
&quot;the worst infidel
<br>
nations.&quot;'
<br>
<p>4. The regime in Bosnia has been and is friendly toward Islamic militants,
<br>
with that area being a hub for terrorist activities.  (The writer cites The
<br>
New York Times Magazine 2000 February 6 -- not known for being right wing.)
<br>
<p>5.  In 1998, the US State Dept. went from listing the KLA as terrorist group
<br>
to not being one.  How many terrorist groups do you know that have been
<br>
delisted?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As I recall events, international aid organizations spent months trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to build public awareness of the mistreatment by Muslims at the hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Bosnian Serbs. I thought it was courageous for the U.S. to oppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the European group that we have more cultural ties with and support the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more foreign Muslims.
</em><br>
<p>At the time, the atrocities commited by the Croatians and Bosnian Muslims
<br>
were quietly ignored, as was the history of the region.  The Serbs did not
<br>
have a good PR team.  The Croatians and Bosnian Muslims did.  This is not to
<br>
whitewash the Serbs, but no side in the Yugoslav civil war was clean.  This
<br>
fact alone should have made it clear that the US and NATO should not have
<br>
gotten involved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In any case, the story being presented doesn't hang together all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well. We were supporting bin Laden as recently as 1998? Would he really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hate the U.S. so much if so? Would he have been targeting car bombs at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;American soldiers when they were fighting on his side against the Serbs?
</em><br>
<p>The claim in the article is not that the US was supporting him in 1998, but
<br>
that the basic policy in Washington was to ignore his connections to the KLA
<br>
and other Muslim groups in the Balkans.  As for the car bomb, I don't know.
<br>
The writer states:
<br>
<p>&quot;They first attracted attention when on December 18, 1995--only a month
<br>
after
<br>
Dayton--a car bomb prematurely exploded in the central Bosnian town of
<br>
Zenica. It was apparently meant for American troops stationed nearby, as
<br>
revenge for the sentencing of Sheik Omah Abdel Rahman in connection with the
<br>
World Trade Center bombing.&quot;
<br>
<p>In other words, that happened in 1995 -- not 1998.  The timing might mean
<br>
he's right, though I think it's more speculative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's hard to pick out the nuggets of truth in an article which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;published by a magazine with an explicit anti-Muslim bias.
</em><br>
<p>I think I just did.  The above claims are factual and, with the exception of
<br>
number 4, can be empirically verified.  This does not mean that Trifkovic is
<br>
correct in all he says, but, at least, you need not dismiss him because of
<br>
his biases.
<br>
<p>Also, even though _Chronicles_ general stance is
<br>
anti-anything-that-isn't-Christian, remember they offer good reasons for US
<br>
disengagement from the Middle East.  They do _not_ advocate, e.g., support
<br>
for Israel or bombing Afghanistan.  That alone should make you think they
<br>
are about to think around some of their biases.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>
