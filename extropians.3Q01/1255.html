This whole rising-sea exercise has made me focus in on how political views
<br>
<p>are put in scientific terms to increase their credibility.  Scientific
<br>
Creationism is a prime example which has very little to do with
<br>
science.  The endangered species act allows a few people to go
<br>
into the middle of a huge wilderness area then discover some endangered
<br>
bug or other, and choke off all development anywhere near their
<br>
property, thus causing its value to skyrocket.
<br>
<p>Currently in this county the endangered-species-ists are struggling
<br>
to block the widening of the artery out of the valley in order to
<br>
preserve the checkerspot butterfly, without attempting to explain
<br>
how adding another lane would hurt that butterfly.  They are really
<br>
against adding the lane, which would allow more people to expand
<br>
out into wide open spaces.  At the same time we have the glass
<br>
winged sharpshooter, a bug which devours grapes, which there is
<br>
vigorous effort to eradicate.  Is not the glass winged sharpshooter
<br>
a species?
<br>
<p>I favor environmentalism, I like trees and nature, Im all for it.
<br>
But the field has been hijacked by statists.  If you read over those
<br>
references, there is an unspoken assumption that all change
<br>
is bad, unconscionable.  They spend all their efforts convincing
<br>
the proletariat that global warming is real, then dont bother
<br>
explaining why it is bad.
<br>
<p>Looks to me like more carbon dioxide would be good for
<br>
plants which would be good for fish which would be good
<br>
for birds, and higher temperatures would make longer
<br>
growing seasons which would be good for people.  In those
<br>
areas which will become too dry, pipe in water from lakes
<br>
and quit dumping perfectly good fresh water into the sea
<br>
in the form of &quot;wild rivers&quot;.  Use that fresh water, dont
<br>
dump it into the sea!  Let us view careful environmental
<br>
modification as environmental repair, not destruction.  spike
