<em>&gt; (1) I assume there is a power in the US constitution that enables federal
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The Constitution says that the congress shall encourage the arts and
<br>
sciences, and the government is empowered to conduct and pay for
<br>
research into any science or technology which involves issues of
<br>
national security.
<br>
<p>The big problem is that saying something can be done is not the same as
<br>
paying for it. Congress may pass a bill to conduct stem cell research,
<br>
but if they only appropriate a million bucks for it, they are
<br>
essentially killing it off. Authorizations are separate from
<br>
appropriations. Furthermore, what congress authorizes and appropriates
<br>
is not necessarily what the President chooses to execute. There is
<br>
literally billions in funding in accounts for various programs which the
<br>
administrations refuse to actually take action on.
<br>
<p>The EPA's Superfund, for example, accumulated hundreds of billions of
<br>
dollars over the years before anyone actually used that money to do
<br>
hazardous waste cleanups. The airport trust fund is similarly stuffed
<br>
with money that isn't being spent on new airports because of local NIMBY
<br>
legal action.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for the ban on human cloning, that sounds harder, coz...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2) In the US or Australia, you have to find a constitutional head of power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (such as the interstate commerce clause, which has been read *very* widely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the courts in the US) before the federal legislature can enact any law at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all. Otherwise, legislative power is left entirely with the states, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can enact laws on any subject. (In Canada, the situation works in reverse:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the provinces have enumerated powers with a default power to the national
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legislature to enact laws on anything.)
</em><br>
<p>Actually, under US v. Lopez and a few more recent cases, the interstate
<br>
commerce clause has been interpreted far more narrowly. The problem is
<br>
no longer in its proper interpretation, but in establishing 'standing',
<br>
which the courts interpret VERY narrowly as well, making it difficult
<br>
for taxpayers to contest acts of congress which are overly broad
<br>
applications of the clause.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is widely commented upon here that it is not clear what power the federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legislature has to ban human cloning. It may have to fall back on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign affairs power, but I'm not aware what international treaties we may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be party to that would require us to pass such legislation. Someone in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US might well ask the same question.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you will notice that the stem cell issue deals only with federal
<br>
funding. They really cannot do anything about privately funded research,
<br>
unless they plan to do a direct assault on Roe v. Wade and are able to
<br>
back it up with scientific proof of human life at conception.
<br>
<p>What they will do is essentially what they do under the income tax laws:
<br>
make anyone who is either a federal employee, corporate officer, or
<br>
government benificiary (as anyone with a bank account, or any other SEC
<br>
approved security, is), comply with the cloning law.
<br>
<p>They can also go at it from the doctor level: No doctor or medical
<br>
institution that participates in medicaid or medicare can receive funds
<br>
and perform cloning as fertility treatment, no med student or doctor
<br>
with government loans for college can perform clonings. Similarly, they
<br>
can mandate that the states must add an anti-cloning clause to their
<br>
medical license regulations.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Or is Charles talking about...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (3) a constitutional *restriction* on power, as opposed to the availability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of an appropriate head of legislative power in the first place? If that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what he means, he may be right, though it's very open to argument. In the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Martha Nussbaum and Cass Sunstein book _Clones and Clones_, Sunstein's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribution is a brilliant piece in which he writes two imaginary Supreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Court opinions, one for and one against the proposition that reproductive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cloning (like contraception and abortion) falls within the supposed implied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitutional right of &quot;privacy&quot; in the US Bill of Rights. Anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in *this* aspect of the US constitutional situation should start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Sunstein's piece.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting. Is this on the web?
