<em>&gt; Okay, okay, cool. Thanks. I'll have a look when there's a moment. I'm

</em><br>
<p>Great!  I think Klein has done some excellent work in this area, though he
<br>
is by no means the first to dip into the area of private roads and
<br>
privatizing them.  Murray Rothbard's classic _For a New Liberty_, first
<br>
published in the early 1970s, also covers the issue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;What is the difference between classical liberalism and libertarianism?  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;think the two share a lot of common ground.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No doubt. Of course, it depends on which version of classical liberalism
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; adopt and which version of libertarianism. I especially have in mind John
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stuart Mill, on one hand, and Robert Nozick on the other, perhaps just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because these are the thinkers I happen to have studied with some
</em><br>
intensity.
<br>
<p>Well, the problem here is that both classical liberals and libertarians are
<br>
a mixed bunch, like any other political grouping.
<br>
<p>Even during their lifetimes, these thinkers went through changes.  Mill
<br>
became more a socialist later in life.  Nozick has become more a welfare
<br>
statist of late.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, I really mean by &quot;classical liberal&quot; little more than the
</em><br>
tradition
<br>
<em>&gt; of Enlightenment liberal thought, as opposed to &quot;liberal&quot; in the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense, which seems to mean something very like &quot;socialist&quot; or at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;philosophical egalitarian&quot;. Of course, the American &quot;liberals&quot; doubtless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim to be the true heirs and successors of the Enlightenment.
</em><br>
<p>I think liberalism in America today means many things, but I do agree it's
<br>
very different from classical [19th century] liberalism.  I'm not sure if
<br>
I'd call it socialist, though it is definitely NOT capitalist.  Most so
<br>
called American liberals are welfare statists -- they generally want a
<br>
mixture of freedom and controls.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nor do I mean the Australian sense of &quot;Liberal&quot;, which is damn close to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;social conservative&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know as much about the Australian political scene...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd say that people from the classical liberal tradition come in all
</em><br>
shapes
<br>
<em>&gt; and sizes in their preparedness to raise and spend taxes. When I think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;libertarians&quot; I have in mind positions which effectively state that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxation is theft. I don't rule out that idea but I want to bracket it off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from most of what I'm doing.
</em><br>
<p>A few libertarians think that some level of taxation is okay, but they are
<br>
very few.  Also, they want this level to be very low and to only fund a
<br>
minarchist state.  Murray Franck, an Objectivist, is one example of such.
<br>
He's argued in _Full Context_ and _The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies_, for
<br>
taxation, but only for minarchical government.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm happy to talk about this a bit further but I really don't want to
</em><br>
spend
<br>
<em>&gt; a lot of time on this thread. However much I might be interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designing a libertarian utopia, my much higher priority at the moment is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working out how to disseminate the longevity meme and win the campaign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against the luddites.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think utopia is possible.  I think radical social change is what one
<br>
should aim for.  What's the difference?  I kind of accept Chris Sciabarra's
<br>
views on the subject here.  Rather than burden this already overburdened
<br>
list and thread with more on this -- I'm trying to participate less and less
<br>
on this particular thread; it's taking up too much time for me at the
<br>
moment -- just take a peek at his site at
