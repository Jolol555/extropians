<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Or, to test if thinking is incorrect, look at its results.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Incorrect thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is that which doesn't work. Come to think of it, we already have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; a system that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; can identify incorrect thinking... it's called science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This sounds good, but even systems have to be interpreted by people.  Has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cryonics produced results?  Has nanotech produced results?  Has life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extension produced results?  Someone has to interpret the value of potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; results.  Even these scientific technologies are controversial with many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientists claiming that they do not and never will produce results.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will always be disagreements.  I still fear one parson's science being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forced onto others.  There is no one-true-science any more than there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one-true-religion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I think science has produced magnificent results. I don't believe in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept of &quot;one person's science&quot; because AFAIK there's only one scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; methodology, and it relies on rigor and reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To the extent any group (including extropians) dismisses science, they become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; susceptible to incorrect thinking, irrational (though popular) beliefs, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cult memes that doom them to eventual failure. I don't fear a system that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accurately identifies incorrect thinking. I welcome it, and I applaud its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful results. As for religion, the reason there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;one-true-religion&quot; is that they are all untrue.
</em><br>
<p>If you push science to its limits as Asimov did with that statement I
<br>
quoted earlier, then you see that it cannot give you all truth without a
<br>
&quot;leap of faith&quot;. So the scientific approach to seeking all truth is
<br>
fallible, it errs, it contains untruth. Hence the &quot;leap of faith&quot; above
<br>
and beyond science for those who CHOOSE to make it. It is a choice. Then
<br>
when you bring it back to empirical reality you get to see what works
<br>
result from this faith. But this &quot;theory of transcendence&quot; in its basic
<br>
form is found all over the world, east and west. In Charles Correa's book,
<br>
&quot;The New Landscape&quot; you will see the &quot;mandala&quot; of a city plan from ancient
<br>
India. The first order interface of physical and metaphysical. Correa was
<br>
Chief Architect of New Bombay (Navi Mumbai).
<br>
<p>Would you say all religions are equally untrue? How then do you
<br>
established which is more or less untrue?
<br>
