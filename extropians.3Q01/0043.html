[Spoilers within]
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The ending I saw left me feeling incomplete because this basic issue went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unresolved.  From the beginning, there were only four possible resolutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the movie:  David dies; David lives forever with Monica, eternally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happy; David lives forever without Monica, eternally lonely; or David
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grows beyond his limits.  The ending we saw doesn't tell us which of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events has occurred!  Did David effectively switch himself off?  Did David
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go on forever dreaming of his last perfect day?  Does David's dreaming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicate that the Successors have gently begun to improve him out of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cul-de-sac?  Are David's dreams eternally lonely because Monica isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there?
</em><br>
<p>A movie should leave you wondering what happened next, and I don't
<br>
object to some ambiguity.  My interpretation is that David has grown,
<br>
through the course of his adventures, and his dreaming demonstrates that.
<br>
He has certainly changed, as we saw at the beginning that he did not
<br>
sleep and did not dream.  And one of the goals that Dr. Hobby had for
<br>
his experiment was that the robots would learn to dream (although I
<br>
think Hobby meant it figuratively).
<br>
<p>I would prefer to think that this was not because the aliens changed him,
<br>
but simply due to the remarkable series of events he had experienced,
<br>
the tremendous longing, the terror, frustration, the ages of loneliness;
<br>
followed up by moments of pure joy so intense that they will last him
<br>
forever.  Through these events, outside the scope of what his designers
<br>
had planned for him, he has grown and changed, and become more than what
<br>
they had imagined.
