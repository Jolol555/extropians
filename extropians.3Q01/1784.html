<p>
I'm currently reading Linus Torvalds' autobiography _Just for Fun_,
<br>
where he offers this comment on the Bill Joy debate:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...] I distinctly remember thinking [Bill Joy] was probably
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the nicest and most interesting of high-profile people I had
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;met in Silicon Valley.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flash forward three years.  I pick up _Wired_ magazine only to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encounter his horribly negative article about technology entitled
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Future Doesn't Need Us.&quot;  I was kind of disappointed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the future doesn't need us.  But he didn't have to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be so negative about it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to tear apart his article line by line, but I have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a general belief that the saddest thing that could ever happen
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to humanity would be that we would just go on and on, as opposed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to evolving.  Bill seemed to feel that advances like genetic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modification make us lose our humanity.  Everybody always thinks
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that something different is inhuman because right now we _are_
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;human.  But as we continue to evolve with whatever happens, in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10,000 years we will not be human according to today's standards.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will just be a different form of human.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Bill's article, he seemed afraid of that.  My feeling is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it's unnatural--and fruitless--to try and curb evolution.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of trying to find two different kinds of dog to produce
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the desired offspring, obviously we will resort to genetics;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it seems inevitable that this will happen for people, too.  In
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my opinion, changing the human race through genetics is preferable
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to leaving the status quo.  I think that, in the bigger picture,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it would be a hell of a lot more interesting to ensure the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continued evolution of not just humans but of society, in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatever direction it goes.  You can't stop technology, and you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can't stop the advances we make in our knowledge of how our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;universe works and how humans are designed.  It's all moving
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so fast that some people, like Bill Joy, find it scary.  But I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see it as part of our natural evolution.
<br>
