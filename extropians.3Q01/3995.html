<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Russian slang could be part of his books simply because the

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Russkis were there first and because they launched 10-100 times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; as much stuff into space as we did over many years.  Also, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Russians after WWII acquired as much (or more) of the rocket

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; scientist talent than the US did and pushed harder and earlier

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; for space exploration and conquest.  It would be very wierd if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; there weren't Russian slang (at least) present in tales of near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; earth space.  Its absence would betray even more bias.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If Russia had so much influence on the Moon, then why is there not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ComIntern office there in the novel??? KGB??? GRU??? All of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entities would have presences on the moon if it had that degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; influence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In the Heinlein universe in which MIAHM was written, the US beat the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; USSR to the moon, and it is the UN govt that administrates it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't deny that it would be wierd if there were no Russian slang. My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; point, which you don't seem to get, is that it is also quite wierd,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; given the population of Chinese on the moon in the novel, that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; absolutely no chinese slang in the novel. This is a major oversight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, this is a very different point than implying that RAH was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to cozy up to the statist sympathies of the literati as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far back as MIAHM.  Desiring literary acceptance of SF generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and as an author in particular and making plot/story decisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to appeal to the literati are quite different.  Heinlein's sales
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were quite good without the sanction of those you imply he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; playing up to.  I don't see he had a lot to gain and there was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than a little to lose if his many fans noticed such.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are still not getting my points. RAH already had good sales,
<br>
that is true, but they were specifically to those who liked him because
<br>
they generally agreed with him on many things, i.e. any message he was
<br>
communicating was preaching to the choir.
<br>
<p>Writers who have true impact on society are those that camouflage their
<br>
messages in packages that look, to their opposition, like the sort of
<br>
literary package they would like to read, like slipping arsenic to
<br>
someone in their lemonade. By the time the opposition, as a group,
<br>
realizes what hit them, the memes have been injected and are wreaking
<br>
their havoc upon old ideological paradigms.
<br>
<p>As I illustrated, Heinlein did this to great effect with &quot;Stranger in a
<br>
Strange Land&quot;, which remains his most widely read work, and enjoys some
<br>
measure of critical respect among the boomer generation as a whole, even
<br>
those who disagree with him on other issues that he didn't deal with in
<br>
that work.
<br>
<p>In &quot;The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress&quot;, he attempted a similar sort of
<br>
memetic sleight of hand, but not as well executed. I specifically did
<br>
not say he was 'trying to cozy up to communists'. He was trying to slip
<br>
them a mickey.
