<p>I wonder what Billy Graham's view is on the terrorist attack?  My mother would have me watch his sermons on tv as a child.  I have always seen him as being on a much higher level then Falwell, and especially Robertson.  
<br>
<p>As a preboarding screener is Alaska about six years ago, I had the experience of screening Rev. Falwell himself for possible weapons at the checkpoint(he beeped!).  The man would not give me his full cooperation, and came across to me as a first-class smiling jerk.  He would not stand up straight, fully extend arms, or come to the center of the checkpoint where wand screenings are done.  
<br>
<p>If I could go back in time I would really have put him in his place.  The good reverend would be getting a proper screening, or simply not board his plane.  And depending on which airport police responded, he would probably not be too molly-coddled.  
<br>
<p>Now, when a the leader of the Russian Orthodox church came through, I got the cooperation I needed.
<br>
<p>I must admit that when Falwell's Alaskan protege came through, the Rev. Jerry Prevo(another Jerry,!), I was surprised by the fact he was very personable, and even charming.  He also likes to stir things up, and gets vilified in the local press.
<br>
<p>Personally, I believe in prayer.  I just don't buy into tele-evangelists who feel they can claim to represent all Christians.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
