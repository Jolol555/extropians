<p>
What follow is at the very margins of interest to most readers of this
<br>
list, but I think it's of potential significance. 
<br>
<p>Some list members will know that I speak up occasionally in favor of a few
<br>
apparently reliable investigators doing work in the field of parapsychology
<br>
or anomalies research, especially those at PEAR, the cut-price lab run
<br>
under sufferance at Princeton University. Dr Roger Nelson and others at
<br>
PEAR have been conducting a curious open-ended experiment for several
<br>
years, based on the premise that consciousness might indeed have a global
<br>
or holistic character, detectable in its occasional interactions with
<br>
mechanical instrumentation. To this end, they have been building a network
<br>
of independent random event generators and recorders in various parts of
<br>
the world. Their surmise (on rather wishy-washy grounds, by my standards)
<br>
is that events capturing the emotional attention of a large part of the
<br>
world's population will bias or skew the output of these REGs in a
<br>
systematic and statistically significant fashion.
<br>
<p>I immediately noted, a few hours after the WTC event blanketed the world's
<br>
media, that this terrible event was a perfect natural experiment. If their
<br>
instruments failed to show a major blip, this would serve as a suitable
<br>
refutation of the theory that mind can couple `paranormally' to machines
<br>
(or perhaps that we live inside a simulation using common objects or
<br>
macros). The preliminary results are now in, and they are rather... striking.
<br>
<p>Go to <a href="http://noosphere.princeton.edu/">http://noosphere.princeton.edu/</a>
<br>
<p>and hit the link titled 
<br>
<p>Analysis of the EGG response to the terrorist attacks on WTC and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pentagon September 11, 2001.
<br>
<p>There are charts, analysis, and further links.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;An estimate for the probability can be made, and lies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between 0.003 and 0.0003 (an odds ratio on the order of 1 in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1000). If we extrapolate the anomalous trend, it begins at about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;04:00 (08:00 GMT), some four hours before the first World
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Trade Center tower was hit. 
</em><br>
<p>Verrrrry interesting.
