<em>&gt;   Leaving aside the question of AI, what's the list impression
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what a superhuman mind might be like (yes I know this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is asking the gorillas about a super-silverback :).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   I tend to think that superhuman intelligence might be best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classified as levels of intelligence quantifiably different from our own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An individual with a 4 sigma IQ and a PerfectRecall chip in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cortex is smarter. But their baseline intel is the same just more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effeciently harnessed. What is everyone's favorites for a cohesive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory of general intelligence? I dislike Multiple Intelligences/Gardner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it lacks any evidence.   Triarchic Intelligence/Sternburg is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposed in a much more scientific fashion (and it's author is actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempting to prove/disprove his hypothesis, unlike Gardner).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   In a nutshell, I can see giving everyone in the human race a 140 IQ,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfect recall, and a turbocharged cognition system. But what ELSE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can we try to do?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

Brian: You have a couple of questions here: 1. What is our best
<br>
understanding of intelligence? 2. How can we improve intelligence? Some
<br>
think that we need to answer 1 in order to make progress on 2. This may not
<br>
be the case. Sometimes it is possible to make technological progress in
<br>
absence of theory. For example, the discovery of gunpowder did not require
<br>
our understanding of the chemical theory underlying this phenomena.
<br>
Sometimes theory seems required, it is hard to imagine (possible but not
<br>
probable) that a civilization could build its first atomic bomb in absence
<br>
of some atomic theory. My guess is that the technological ability to create
<br>
greater intelligence will precede a detailed theory of intelligence. Allow
<br>
me to quote myself here:
<br>
<p>&quot; The ease in which we might create a larger brain through genetic
<br>
engineering is underscored by the fairly recent discovery in developmental
<br>
genetics of homeobox genes: genes that control the development of the body
<br>
plans of a larger number of organisms.  For our purposes what is of interest
<br>
is that there are a number of homeobox genes that that control the growth of
<br>
various brain regions.[9] For example, if you want to make a larger brain in
<br>
a frog embryo simply insert some RNA from the gene X-Otx2 and voilà-you have
<br>
a frog embryo with a larger brain, specifically, the mid and forebrain mass
<br>
is increased.[10] Homeobox genes also come in various forms of generality.
<br>
Otx2 is obviously very general in its scope; in contrast, for example, Emx1
<br>
controls the growth of the isocortex (one of the two regions of the
<br>
neocortex). Thus, if we believe that intelligence....might be aided by
<br>
tweaking one area of the brain or another there may be just the right
<br>
homeobox gene for this task.&quot;
<br>
I am inclined to think that we could create a greater intelligence from a
<br>
human zygote by the end of the decade if the project was taken on with the
<br>
same political enthusiasm as say the moon landing. On the other hand, it is
<br>
quite possible, as Jerry Fodor et al. have argued, that a general
<br>
understanding of our own cognition (and hence intelligence) may forever
<br>
elude us. There is a sense in which we may be able to create further than we
<br>
can understand.
<br>
Mark.
