<p>Thank you, Eliezer.
<br>
<p>Crimes against Humanity are the worst crimes.  Genocide is the worst of those.  To
<br>
me, the suggestion to even consider engagement in genocide is a crime against
<br>
Humanity.  This is conceptual vandalism.  It tears down our hope that people will
<br>
rise above our genetic blood lust and become beings worthy to go to the stars.  I
<br>
believe that this thread has destroyed our group, we just don't know it yet.
<br>
<p>Thankfully, this kind of idea will not be brought to POTUS.  He may be dumb as a
<br>
fence post, but his is not a monster, and he would never listen to it.  If he did,
<br>
and I truly thought this country would go that way, I would be on the first
<br>
transport to Afghanistan to either act as part of a human shield for the people
<br>
there, or to go with them so as to avoid living to see a world without value.
<br>
<p>I am quite sure that a very large number of Americans, and Humanists from around
<br>
the world, would decide the same way.  Did the idiotic analysis proposed take that
<br>
into consideration?
<br>
<p>A Rabbi I saw on the coverage told a story from the Holocaust about a prisoner in
<br>
one of the genocide camps that was seen praying to God and giving thanks.  Another
<br>
prisoner asked what he could possibly be thanking God for.  Referring to the
<br>
people who put him there, he said, &quot;I thank God He did not make me one of them.&quot;
<br>
