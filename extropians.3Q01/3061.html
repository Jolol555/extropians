<p>You yourself have said it. :)

<p><em>&gt; I hasten to add, that quite often

</em><br>
<p>Oh, gee, let's utterly abnegate the immediately prior paragraph.
<br>
<p>Lee, I invite you to consider the evidently-unpondered possibility that
<br>
_vocally plonking_ someone can be something very different from
<br>
&quot;a frightened tactic of self-censorship&quot;. It can be a tool of 
<br>
diplomacy no less than walking out of a stalled negotiation, or 
<br>
(as some have implied) the &quot;cut direct&quot;.
<br>
<p>In my case, I had had enough. If you have deduced that the sole
<br>
cause of my recent plonk was &quot;partisan&quot;, I can do nothing for you
<br>
except to tell you you are in error. The behavior I was reacting to
<br>
was indeed disagreeable. Was it a &quot;point of view&quot;? No, a simple
<br>
(stupid) behavior; the (my) last straw for the time being.
<br>
<p>_Silently plonking_ someone is different. How would you, Lee, 
<br>
know to criticize?
<br>
<p>Plonking means never having to deign to respond. It gives me more 
<br>
time to talk to scary looking street people.
<br>
<p>Having said this, I do consider every plonk a species of failure.
<br>
In some cases, it's a failure to avoid stepping in something unappetizing.
<br>
<p>Not frightened, fairly experienced, I remain
<br>
<p>MMB
