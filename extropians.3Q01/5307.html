<em>&gt; &gt; How do you know what Heston thinks his creator is?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it is clear from Heston's other discussions that he believes in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christian God as creator.  I'm not sure this is germane to the discussion.
</em><br>
<p>Well, you quoted him saying 'the Creator', which could be anything, and
<br>
I think that irrespective of his own religious views, he said this
<br>
specifically to appeal to those who may have other opinions of who the
<br>
'creator' is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, why not? US civilization was not predominantly created by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; minds of africans, chinese, or native americans. Why not give credit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where credit is due?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think Heston implying that whites deserve more credit for US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization than blacks, native Americans, etc.  You are reading some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implications even farther than I would have imagined.
</em><br>
<p>What he was asking is why blacks are given so much more of a prominent
<br>
place in current history books than whites like George Washington and
<br>
Thomas Jefferson. I think that he was trying to show that excluding the
<br>
founding fathers is at least as unjust as excluding later civil rights
<br>
leaders, and that all should be represented in history books
<br>
proportionate to their actual contribution to the history of the
<br>
country.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hate crime laws are not an example of gay rights.  They are racial laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; which sometimes include sexual orientation or gender.  These laws give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; sentencing guidelines for criminals not rights to citizens.  Gay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; equal-rights laws would be ones advocating marriage, cohabitation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; insurance, joint tax returns, inheriting property, joint ownership of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; property, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But they don't generally do this, they set sentencing guidelines for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those who exercise their own rights to not be forced into accepting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lifestyles they view as abhorrent. When these include proscriptions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; against using words in speech which gays use as a matter of course in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their own intra-gay communications, then the line is crossed into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thought repression, equal protection, and first amendment violations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's why I make it clear that hate-crime laws are NOT an example of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equal-rights laws.  They do not have the same purpose or effect.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, they ARE equal rights laws. They are intended to eliminate the
<br>
unequal living conditions that minorities are subjected to by bigots
<br>
through harassment. Just why they are needed when ordinary harassment
<br>
laws have worked for the rest of us is beyond me.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not even going to get into the comparison of gun-owners with Holocaust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; victims.  I think this is extreme hyperbole.  Trying to argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gun-owners are victimized as much as Jews is a losing argument in any event.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if you're right, it just sounds whiny at best and anti-Semitic at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst.  Why not just say you are unfair victims?  Comparisons to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Holocaust or comparing your opponents to Nazis never enlightens a debate.
</em><br>
<p>The reason why we can and do make the comparison, Harvey, is because the
<br>
primary gun control law in this country, the Gun Control Act of 1968,
<br>
has been documented (by a Jewish gun-rights group) to have been
<br>
purposely translated from the 1938 revised National Weapons Law of
<br>
Germany which was used to disarm the Jews, and put into effect here by
<br>
Democrat Senator Thomas Dodd. We can compare ourselves to jews because
<br>
we are living under anti-semitic originated laws right now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do you or do you not think that it is right for a person to not know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when their body tissues are being exposed to an HIV carrier under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conditions which have been proven to be communicable for the virus?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do. 
</em><br>
<p>So you think it is alright for HIV carriers to willfully expose others
<br>
to the virus without telling them? Excuse me? Maybe you misunderstood my
<br>
original statement, but if you do think this way, it is no wonder you
<br>
think Heston is your enemy, you would be mine too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But this is irrelevant to my point.  My point is that this was never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stated by Heston.  Everybody keeps jumping on this because Heston implied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his position on this without stating it.  This is the perfect example of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I was trying to point out.  He gives an example and leaves it up to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; audience to interpret conclusions from it.  You are arguing for your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion, which may be correct.  But you are missing the fact that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading your conclusion into his words.  Heston never stated this position
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explicitly.  Likewise, other implications can be read into his other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples that weren't specifically stated.  Some people seem to be insisting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that their interpretations and conclusions from each example are the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible ones to derive.  I am pointing out that there are no clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusions from his examples, and different audience members with interpret
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them differently.  Some of those interpretations might be excessively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reactionary.
</em><br>
<p>That Heston is drawing attention to a situation that he feels is an
<br>
unjust one is irrelevant to his own implied opinion about it. It doesn't
<br>
matter if different people have different opinions about how important
<br>
or severe this situation is, so long as they see it as unjust as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Which is more accurate? I mean, if a white fellow who was born in South
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Africa or Rhodesia immigrated to the US, does he or does he not have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; right to call himself an 'African-American'??? Does he then have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; right to apply for positions in college and employment that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; determined by the fact that he is 'African-American', to the exclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of other white fellows who were born here in the US, or who immigrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from european nations? If he doesn't have this right, then please
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; explain why...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very good point.  Such a person would be an African-American by geographical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; origin.  This could be confusing.  However, African-American as a race
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implies descended from original Africans, just as native Americans implies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descended from original Americans.  Of course there were earlier and later
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peoples in both places, and history and breeding are blurring all such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lines.  These definitions all end up meaningless if they are analyzed.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, they are quite meaningless. What expiration date do you put on
<br>
having a status as 'original Africans'??? We are all African if you go
<br>
far back enough (even native Americans are). So what date do you decide
<br>
determines what one's 'Africanness' is? Jews lived in Egypt for hundreds
<br>
of years, and later migrated all over europe, asia, and africa. It is
<br>
nearly impossible for a person of european extraction to have absolutely
<br>
no jewish blood in them, so therefore most europeans can be found to
<br>
have African ancestry that is less than 3000 years old. Even later, many
<br>
Italians, Greeks, Albanians, Spaniards, etc have african blood that
<br>
dates only back to the Moorish conquests of the middle ages.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, what about africans who never lived here in the US under
<br>
slavery or Jim Crow, who are only recent immigrants whose families never
<br>
suffered from American prejudice (merely the even greater tribal
<br>
prejudices of their homeland in africa. Why should they enjoy
<br>
preferential treatment under affirmative action when their families
<br>
never suffered the injustices of slavery here?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Since you've decided that 'white' is bad, what about 'european'?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where did you get the idea that I think &quot;white&quot; is bad?
</em><br>
<p>You said that using the term 'white' is as racist as using the term
<br>
'black' instead of 'African-American'
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do the Basques or Lithuanians, who have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; little or no common cultural or linguistic connection to other european
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cultures, get excluded or are they the default?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Excluded from what?  Default what?  I don't know what you are talking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am arguing AGAINST dividing people up by race, gender or sexual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orientation.
</em><br>
<p>To what degree? Are you opposed to simply describing someone by such
<br>
characteristics, or are you just opposed to treating people according to
<br>
such characteristics? There is the line between free speech and
<br>
discriminatory acts.
<br>
<p>In the second case, do you mean under all circumstances, public and
<br>
private?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Apples and oranges, Harvey. He hates rap because rap encourages violence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; against police, against the state, and for war and bigotry against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whites in general. Rap IS racist, and therefore, should be treated at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; least as much a 'hate crime' as anything said by the KKK. It should not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be celebrated by popular culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All true, but it seems inconsistent to claim the right to talk about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;negros&quot; without being called racist, while then working to stop rap music.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Freedom of speech is freedom to say bad things as well as good.  Just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Heston is describing how political correctness prevents him from saying what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he wants, he turns around and says rap musicians shouldn't say what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want.
</em><br>
<p>Heston is not talking about committing violent crimes against innocent
<br>
people. Rappers are. End of story.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also think you have an inflated idea of what a hate crime is.  Hate crimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give tougher sentences on criminals who commit violent crimes.  They do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrest people for mere words or ideas.  Even if one disagrees with hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime laws, I think you are exaggerating their effect.  I will pay $100 if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you show me an actual law that proscribes a punishment for mere speech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without the threat or act of real violence.  I think this is another urban
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legend.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Discussion and action are completely different things, Harvey.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed.  But he has a definite call to action at the end of the speech.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calls for civil disobedience and for people to &quot;act&quot; when these kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things occur.  Now he doesn't specify what exact acts should be taken, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is clear that some kind of action is being requested.
</em><br>
<p>Of course. And is this wrong? Why is it that unjust laws are to be
<br>
resisted unless they are unjust toward white males? Furthermore, how is
<br>
a gun owner supposed to peacefully resist unjust gun laws when any
<br>
violation of a gun law is considered a violent crime?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This 'code word' term is one more catch phrase of political correctness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; police doing their typical hate baiting. And why is what he said wrong?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We are all entitled to our own values, we just are not entitled to act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on them all. We cannot be compelled to act contrary to our values (with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a few obvious exceptions required by citizenship).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You miss my point again.  I didn't say this viewpoint was bad.  My point is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Heston never made this statement.  He gave an example and everybody get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the implication that we don't have to like homosexuality.  He never said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this.  My point is that if this &quot;implication&quot; is clear from the example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without him saying it, what other examples are clear from the other examples
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about blacks, Jews, African-Americans, women, transvestites, transsexuals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.?  Do these examples also imply that we don't have to like them or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooperate with them?  This is my point, that the implications being read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into his speech go beyond what the literal words can be shown to say.
</em><br>
<p>His point is that the government is forcing people by statute,
<br>
jack-boot, and expenditure of taxpayer dollars, to act in ways contrary
<br>
to their values, and to punish people for their beliefs with their own
<br>
money. His point is that the injustice of a minority of rich white males
<br>
upon the rest of society in the past does not justify the injustice
<br>
today by a majority of blacks, women, poor people, and other formerly
<br>
disadvantaged groups. Our country was structured in such a way as to
<br>
protect the rights of the individual against the tyranny of the
<br>
majority, but that tyranny is exactly what is occuring today, with
<br>
prettied up 'code words' for revenge like 'affirmative action',
<br>
'set-asides', and 'racial quotas'.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I imagine you mean that 'cream' is one more 'code word' for 'elite white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, but I did assume that Harvard scholars are mostly rich white straight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; males.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No, it's not. It was his money being invested in ICE-T's work, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was his right to express his displeasure at how his money was being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spent. By expressing his displeasure, he was able to illuminate other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stockholders as to how their own money was being invested, and they made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their own decisions. Pop music is not speech, it is commerce.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why did this example appear in a song about free speech?  He clearly was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showing that he would not tolerate this kind of speech as an example of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of free speech he was advocating.  What was this whole example about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and why was it in this speech about freedom of speech if he wasn't talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about freedom of speech?
</em><br>
<p>Freedom of speech does not mean that you have the right to force others
<br>
to pay for (or listen to) your freedom of speech. Get it? At the Warner
<br>
Bros stockholders meeting, I don't think he even stated his opinion, he
<br>
merely asked if the following lyrics were what the stockholders wanted
<br>
the company to represent, and then proceeded to recite the lyrics of the
<br>
song in question. The stockholders drew their own conclusions about how
<br>
they wanted their company and their money to be represented to the
<br>
public.
