From: &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20regarding%20the%20YINYANG%20post%20on%20extropians&In-Reply-To=&lt;007201c11715$06864760$6e5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Or, to test if thinking is incorrect, look at its results.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Incorrect thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is that which doesn't work. Come to think of it, we already have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a system that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can identify incorrect thinking... it's called science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sounds good, but even systems have to be interpreted by people.  Has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryonics produced results?  Has nanotech produced results?  Has life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extension produced results?  Someone has to interpret the value of potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results.  Even these scientific technologies are controversial with many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists claiming that they do not and never will produce results.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will always be disagreements.  I still fear one parson's science being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forced onto others.  There is no one-true-science any more than there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one-true-religion
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I think science has produced magnificent results. I don't believe in the
<br>
concept of &quot;one person's science&quot; because AFAIK there's only one scientific
<br>
methodology, and it relies on rigor and reason.
<br>
To the extent any group (including extropians) dismisses science, they become
<br>
susceptible to incorrect thinking, irrational (though popular) beliefs, and
<br>
cult memes that doom them to eventual failure. I don't fear a system that
<br>
accurately identifies incorrect thinking. I welcome it, and I applaud its
<br>
successful results. As for religion, the reason there is no
<br>
&quot;one-true-religion&quot; is that they are all untrue.
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, and ego.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
