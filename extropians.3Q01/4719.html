Mike wrote (responding to my post):
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It does seem that way, especially if you base your opinions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only on the arguments of one side.
</em><br>
<p>Mike, as I thought my letter indicated, I started out thinking
<br>
the piece was completely slanted, but in trying to extract
<br>
the data underlying the arguments there appeared to be some
<br>
merit to the case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; US farm subsidies are actually quite low at the moment, only a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billion for a multi-hundred billion dollar industry.
</em><br>
<p>You have to resist making these claims unless you happen
<br>
to have the data to back them up.  I just happened to have
<br>
downloaded a spreadsheet about farm income from www.usda.gov
<br>
a few days ago (I'm trying to calculate the eventual market
<br>
sizes for products Robiobotics might allow the development of)
<br>
and so I can calculate the numbers for you.
<br>
<p>In 1999 (the last year available), total &quot;Farm marketings&quot; were $188.6B.
<br>
&quot;Government payments&quot; were $20.6B or almost 11% of the &quot;marketings&quot; value.
<br>
Now I realize that that isn't a *huge* number but it isn't a &quot;few billion&quot;
<br>
either.  I'll simply point out that I'm fairly sure it is larger than the
<br>
entire NIH budget and very sure that it is much larger than the NASA budget.
<br>
Them there ain't chicken feed son.  The payments were lower through most
<br>
of the '90s ranging from $7-9 billion -- amounts that could certainly
<br>
buy a lot more medical research or space missions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, this does seem inequitable, unless of course you consider the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; record of third world countries in defaulting on loans, late in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; payments, etc.
</em><br>
<p>I'm no expert on the history here, but if the premise I laid out is
<br>
true, then we (or the IMF + world bankers) have created the sitution.
<br>
And I recall at least one period back in the '80s where the bankers
<br>
went running to the government and had to be bailed out.  I believe
<br>
I posted something recently about the article involving U.S. CIA
<br>
involvement in the current mess in the Congo -- if we contribute to
<br>
setting up western oriented &quot;dictators&quot; then they get toppled later,
<br>
the country goes belly up and the loans don't get repaid -- can you
<br>
really blame those countries?  Haven't we made our own stew?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Keep in mind also that native jamaicans don't own the banana plantations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Jamaica either, they are owned by Brits.
</em><br>
<p>Granted that this &quot;might&quot; be true, the issue is jobs here.  No
<br>
banana market translates to no jobs translates to idle people
<br>
with nothing to do but resort to criminal activities to support
<br>
themselves.  Probably contributes to greater availability of
<br>
marijuana (not that I object to this) but that leads to greater
<br>
evidence of a &quot;problem&quot; that must be &quot;controlled&quot; leading to
<br>
outcries for and support for &quot;The Drug War&quot;.
<br>
<p>The other points I mainly agreed with.
<br>
<p>The Lee commented:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But someone in Jamaica still has money to buy the foreign goods. 
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but this is where you have to get into the &quot;fine print&quot;
<br>
of the IMF contracts.  The IMF says &quot;no you can't loan money
<br>
to your farmers (at reasonable interest rates) to allow them
<br>
to develop industrial agribusiness infrastructure&quot;.  Presumably
<br>
you can use the money to build things like schools, hospitals,
<br>
roads, etc.  But that doesn't make the country more productive
<br>
(in the short term).  As a result you don't have the national
<br>
income that would allow you to repay the loan.  What happens?
<br>
When your loans don't get repaid you go *back* to the IMF
<br>
and request an even bigger loan (or argue for debt relief).
<br>
These countries don't have enough global awareness to say
<br>
something like we are going to take $1B and develop a world-class
<br>
biotechnology industry or something equivalent that could
<br>
potentially provide real long term opportunities for their
<br>
people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why can't the farmers do whatever those people are doing?
</em><br>
<p>Well, I suspect some of the people do get employed for things
<br>
like building the schools, roads, etc.  But once the loan
<br>
money runs out -- then what do they do?  The TV show pointed
<br>
out that a lot of them get employed in the tourist business.
<br>
Thats great but its seasonal.  The show also pointed out
<br>
that the investment isn't being made in things like sewar
<br>
plants that will protect the &quot;beautiful environment&quot; from
<br>
those hordes of tourists.  So eventually the country will
<br>
be depleated of its &quot;natural resource&quot;.
<br>
<p>Fundamentally I think the system is messed up because I don't
<br>
think the bankers would really want to lift up foreign countries
<br>
so they really effectively compete against the U.S. and the
<br>
foreign countries don't have sufficient awareness and experience
<br>
in development to know how they should expend the borrowed
<br>
funds to develop the infrastructure to provide sustainable
<br>
revenue to repay the loans.
<br>
<p>In another note, Lee said that I said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Extending credit to [third world] countries [which have for some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason or another little potential to create wealth] is like giving a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; platinum card to a recovering shopaholic who lives on welfare: i.e. a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really really dumb idea.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, that was Mike Lorrey's rhetoric, *not* mine.
<br>
<p>Then Lee suggested having profit-minded bankers figure out how
<br>
to develop a country by confining their investment to it but
<br>
require they try to make the largest possible profit.
<br>
<p>My response is that it has been done by the Grameen Bank and it
<br>
works very well.  The trick is to *not* target the money for
<br>
large infrastructure projects (the things that prop up political
<br>
figures that bring home loans from the IMF) but instead to target
<br>
micro-loans ($100-$500) to individual entrepreneurs *AND* put them
<br>
into support groups where they can learn from each others business
<br>
experience, develop accounting skills, etc.  Strategies like
<br>
that have proved very successful at uplifting people.  But
<br>
that isn't how the IMF operates.
<br>
<p>It looks to me like the deck has really been stacked and
<br>
that the anti-globalization folks do have some arguments
<br>
worth listening to.  As Anders points out, you want to
<br>
do this but you don't want to do it all at once.  The
<br>
trick is to use the finds wisely enough and to implement
<br>
the tariff changes gradually enough that the people have
<br>
time to change their behaivor, learn new skills, develop
<br>
other sources of income, etc.
