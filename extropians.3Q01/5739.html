<p>The military brass were all over that in 76.  They recognized that video games
<br>
could be a hell of a tool for pilot training.  I took flying lessons in 1982 from
<br>
an
<br>
instructor who recognized that video games were evidently already contributing
<br>
to students coming in with a good intuitive feel for how to control airplanes.
<br>
That was back in the days before the simulations were even very good.
<br>
<p>I suspect computer sims will be very most important tool for training
<br>
military personnel, and before it's over, the most important tool for
<br>
training most employees.  spike
