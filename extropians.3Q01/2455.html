<em>&gt; Olga writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Remember - whites profited from UNPAID slave
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; labor for hundreds of years.  When a tourist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; goes to visit the White House, it is rarely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mentioned - if at all - that it was built
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with unpaid slave labor.  How shameful - both
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this historic fact, and the fact that not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; many people are aware of this.
</em><br>
<p>:-)   This is getting comical, the miscommunication,
<br>
I mean!  Get a load of the following:
<br>
<p>Okay, so I responded to the above with
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; You are quite wrong.  I don't think I've ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; met anyone so ignorant of history as to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; unaware of slavery.
</em><br>
<p>and first off, someone took this to mean that I
<br>
denied that slavery was implemented by white people,
<br>
or that I was defending it, or that I myself denied
<br>
that it existed.   Good grief.
<br>
<p>Now Olga comes back with
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You never met anyone so ignorant of history?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moi?
</em><br>
<p>Oh no!  Even though *she* was the one to bring up
<br>
the evils of slavery, she thinks that **I** am
<br>
talking about *her*!?   Wow!  When, of course,
<br>
I was merely responding to
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the fact that not many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people are aware of this.
</em><br>
<p>(because, of course, everyone does know this, i.e.,
<br>
that &quot;whites profited from UNPAID slave labor
<br>
for hundreds of years&quot;).  Duh!  Well what does
<br>
slavery mean?  (Gee!  I hope that that isn't
<br>
misunderstood too!)  For the last #!*%$ time,
<br>
the quoted phrase is %100 percent true (not that
<br>
it was Olga who was doubting that I knew it, but
<br>
I just have to protect myself from the 800 lurkers
<br>
on this list).
<br>
<p>You think I'm exaggerating?  No!  She really 
<br>
concluded from the above, that I was saying that
<br>
she was ignorant of the history (of course
<br>
that makes zero sense, since it was she who
<br>
described all that about who built the White
<br>
House, etc.).
<br>
<p>She continues
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee, dearest, do you remember just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple of days ago, when you were telling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me that &quot;It really would be best for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerned to avoid personal references
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this.
</em><br>
<p>Olga, can you believe that I wasn't, really, 
<br>
really, really, wasn't referring to you???
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You also wrote about the importance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;confin[ing] oneself to careful argument.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And you didn't do that, either.  Dear,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oh dear - what am I going to do with you?
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but I did.  You (for some unknown reason
<br>
took personally what clearly did not apply to
<br>
you).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You wrote:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It's usually put forth as the reason that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Civil War was fought, &quot;to free the slaves&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Abraham Lincoln is probably best known &quot;for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; freeing the slaves.&quot;   Okay :-)  maybe you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; didn't hear this growing up because you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; weren't here.
</em><br>
<p>What I meant, was literal (as usual).  Namely
<br>
that although you undoubtedly learned the 
<br>
historical facts a long time ago (or have done
<br>
a very good job recently), you perhaps didn't
<br>
understand that everyone learns about Abraham
<br>
Lincoln in elementary school here.  And in
<br>
middle school. And in high school.
<br>
<p>You probably thought that this was yet another
<br>
slam:  that I was implying (I am not) that you
<br>
simply didn't know about this period.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; If Thomas Sowell says that racism doesn't exist in the U.S.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; he's lying ... if that's what he says ...).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; By no means does he say such a thing!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee, I didn't say Sowell says such a thing.
</em><br>
<p>But it's customary to clear any innocent third
<br>
party's name in these discussions.  To make it
<br>
**perfectly** clear to any other reader the 
<br>
true nature of some prominent person's views.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's why I wrote the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;IF&quot; up there a couple of times.
</em><br>
<p>Don't be so sensitive.  Again, you were reading
<br>
implications where they did not belong.  I know
<br>
exactly what &quot;IF&quot; means.  (Maybe I should have
<br>
said, &quot;For your information, Thomas Sowell...
<br>
etc.&quot;)  But no, there is a way to mis-read that
<br>
too.  I give up.
<br>
<p>Lee
