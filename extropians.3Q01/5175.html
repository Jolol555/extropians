</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. If globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, Jesus!  The assumption is that the interests of the trans-national
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations are antithetical to those of humanity!  Good grief!  
</em><br>
<p>Corporations are legal entities with many of the rights of human
<br>
beings. They have their own interests and agendas which are distinct
<br>
from those of the human beings who are members of them. (Corporate
<br>
officers are charged with a duty of pursuing the interests of the
<br>
corporation and can be fired or even sued if they let their own
<br>
preferences get in the way.)
<br>
<p>One may argue that in this respect, this question applies equally to
<br>
trans-human AIs. &quot;If the singularity is inevitable, it should primarily
<br>
serve humanity rather than the interests of non-human AIs.&quot; Discuss!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the WSPQ (World's Shortest Political Quiz) this loaded, and I simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't recognize it because I'm a libertarian?  This is scary!
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
To my (non-American) eyes the answer is &quot;yes, it was&quot;. Be scared!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. I'd always support my country, whether it was right or wrong. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And what does **support** mean?  Defend physically, or refuse to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticize?  Clearly the answer that the test tries very, very hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get out of one is &quot;disagree&quot;, or &quot;disagree strongly&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Given the British political experience in the 20th century it means
<br>
&quot;blindly sign up to go fight in the trenches and die horribly, in
<br>
defense of the national honour&quot;.
<br>
<p>10% of the menfolk of one generation did just that, and another 20% 
<br>
came home maimed in one way or another. Ever since then, unthinking
<br>
patriotism has left a rather bitter taste in the mouth. (Emphasis
<br>
on &quot;unthinking&quot;: but anyone with half a brain cell knows that &quot;national
<br>
honour&quot; is merely an abstraction, and a really good handle for
<br>
scoundrels to use to manipulate people into doing what they want. As
<br>
witness the tendency of just about every US president in my lifetime
<br>
to wrap themselves in the flag and pray to almightly GAAWWWD publicly
<br>
when they want to get someone else to do something unpleasant for
<br>
them.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. No one chooses their country of birth, so it's absurd to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proud of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absurd?  While this question isn't as absurd as the first two,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is hardly the right word here.
</em><br>
<p>It's an assertion I agree with very strongly. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4. Our nation has many unique virtues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps not such a bad question.
</em><br>
<p>What makes _your_ nation unique? The people who live in it? Its history?
<br>
Or some other factor? (If you leave out the history side of things, the
<br>
USA, where you live, is anything but unique -- there are any number of
<br>
constitutional democracies in the world today, in fact they're in the 
<br>
majority among nations.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay
</em><br>
<p>This quiz, so far, is probing the extent of your patriotism -- with an
<br>
emphasis on certain values that are still held by the reactionary right
<br>
in the UK, but decried by the internationalists (who are not necessarily
<br>
the left; they're just everyone who isn't in the reactionary right,
<br>
including the progressive right).
<br>
<p>It's going to look rather different to an American, as the USA today has
<br>
about the same level of jingoistic rah-rah my-country-right-or-wrong
<br>
patriotism that the UK had prior to 1914. (In other words, an unhealthy
<br>
amount -- enough to kill a large fraction of the population for no good
<br>
reason. I mean, you guys call yourselves libertarians ...?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 6. Jews surely have to take some of the responsibility for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their persecution over the past 2000 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So how can one possibly answer that if he or she believes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Jews must take a small share of the responsibility,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say five or ten percent?  Why, one must then *agree*, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's what the word &quot;some&quot; means.  But then one is immediately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implicated, (or self-implicated, depending on one's temperament)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as an anti-Semite.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, it's a bad question. I think it's probably aimed at winkling
<br>
out the barking fringe of conservative supporters in the UK -- who cross
<br>
over with unsavoury groups like the BNP and the NF. (Overt neo-Nazi
<br>
parties.) An equivalent question for the US political milieu would be
<br>
&quot;Blacks surely have to take some of the responsibility for their own
<br>
failure to prosper since the 1860's.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 6. The growing fusion between information and entertainment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a worrying contribution to the public's shrinking attention span. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So does &quot;worrying&quot; mean that one wishes to regulate it?  Luckily,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I gave up on this quiz two questions back, and don't have to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
You're now reading implications into these questions that probably
<br>
go beyond their intent. However, I think in this case that the regulatory
<br>
urge is _exactly_ what this question is intended to dig out -- remember,
<br>
the poll is checking for authoritarian tendencies, right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seriously:  I do *not* remember anyone complaining about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tendentiousness of the questions on the former quizzes.  PLEASE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say so if you *did* have any problem with those earlier quizzes.
</em><br>
<p>I did. &quot;The world's shortest political quiz&quot;, for example, was a biased
<br>
travesty.
<br>
<p>Look a year or so ago I (jokingly) came up with a political geek code
<br>
for soc.history.what-if (in the wake of some off-topic flame wars over

politics). Here it is! Tell me what you think ...

I'm familiar with. If you spot any, please let me know so that I can remove
<br>
them!)
<br>
<p>First come five major categories. You probably have a stance on all of
<br>
these axes. Pick your positions and separate them with spaces. If you
<br>
vary between two (such as S++ and S-), separate them with a slash,
<br>
thus: S++/S-.
<br>
<p><p>S    Society. You know; they're all around us. But how important is it,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;really?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S++++  The individual only exists as part of a broader human society;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their goals and aspirations are only valid insofar as they advance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;society's goals
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S+++   Society is important and has a right to override individual
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preferences or wants where appropriate.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S++    Society is important, but individuals have rights too, and there
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a balancing point between the two -- although an individuals
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rights stop at the end of their nose, and society has to look after
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everything else.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S+     Society is just a useful social construct; it's made up of people,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and people come first.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S-     Society is an emergent phenomenon that arises from interactions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among people. It has no independent existence without the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;willing participation of individuals.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S--    Society is all too often used as an excuse to limit individual
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rights; we need to be careful about throwing this term around in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S---   ... it's spelt &quot;sheeple&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S----  There is no such thing as society
<br>
<p><p>C    Church politics. Should it have any place in government?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C++++  I am the pope/ayatollah/chief rabbi! You betcha!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C+++   The [insert holy book] tells us how we should live our lives,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we ought to legislate its provisions into law and live by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them. Religious observation and education should be compulsory.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C++    In general, the [insert holy book] is a good guide to life,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though I figure as this is an enlightened age we can replace
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;stoning to death&quot; with five years hard labour. (And that bit
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about not wearing mixed fibres -- drop it.) Religious observance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be encouraged, and irreligous education discouraged.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C+     I believe in [insert holy book] and will live by it, but I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't think non-religionists need to be bound by it. (It's their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soul, right?) Religious education and observance is a personal 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matter.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!C     I am an atheist.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?C     I think I might be an agnostic, but I'm not sure.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C-     It's a good idea to keep priests away from the education system
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and government. Separation of church and state.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C--    Religion, based on prehistoric irrationalism, has no place in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the running of a modern state. Laws and values should be based
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on introspective ethical scrutiny, not superstition.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C---   Mandating religious education or observance is a tool of 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oppression! Religion is irrational guff! In fact, we should be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;targeting education to innoculate kids against the virus of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pernicious superstition. (And close the churches.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C----  Kill the priests.
<br>
<p><p>F    Force Majeure. Does might make right, at national level? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F++++  I've got an H-bomb, so bend and spread 'em. (Alternatively:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do we want? Lebensraum! Where do we want it? Ost! When
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do we want it? Now!&quot;)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F+++   There are of course rules of civilized warfare, but if our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;economic or political interests are threatened we reserve the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right to defend them by sending an aircraft carrier or organizing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a discreet coup d'etat. And we'll probably exercise that right --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frequently. If we _don't_ have that kind of arsenal, we'll send
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrorists.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F++    We have armed forces to defend ourselves against attack, and if
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can show us a UN resolution we'll lend you a bomber squadron
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or two. But in general we don't invade other countries and we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't send terrorists.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F+     Our constitution forbids us from operating away from home. So
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sorry, UN security council.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F-     We used to have an army, but we caught them planning a coup so
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we took away their guns and loaned them to the UN on peacekeeping 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duties for the next forty years.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F--    If you invade us we'll all sit down. And hold our breath until we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turn blue. (You'll be sorry.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F---   We don't have an army -- but all independent-minded people pack
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;automatic weapons, and some of the neighbours have fully privately
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;owned tactical nukes. Invade us at your peril.
<br>
<p><p>I    Individuality. You know how important you are. But does everyone else?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I++++  I am the Quonster's pedigreed consultant. Fear me.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I+++   Individuals have inviolable rights. If you try to violate my 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rights you are attacking me and I can exercise the right to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self-defense.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I++    All people have rights, but there are common goods that can be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;degraded by the unhindered exercise of private rights -- for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;example, by polluting a common resource such as the atmosphere.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore concede that some common goods must override
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;individual rights, but we'd rather this was the exception than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rule.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I+     You have rights, but if you abuse them we may have to take them
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away from you. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I-     Rights are just a legalistic construct. If you get in our great
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nation's way, you have only yourself to blame.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I--    Your body belongs to the state; we know what's best for you. Do
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as you're told and nothing nasty will happen. Or else.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I---   I am the Quonster.
<br>
<p><p>R    Rights. This is a difficult one ...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R!     I believe in absolute, &quot;natural&quot; rights that exist in and of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RS     I believe rights exist by implied social contract; they're a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;legal construct that makes it possible for people to coexist.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R-     I don't believe in rights.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RA     I believe all animals have rights, too.
<br>
<p><p>Now let's consider some more clearly defined areas. A right is prefixed
<br>
with a lowercase &quot;r&quot;, then the right's identifying letter, then a score
<br>
from @@@@ to %%%%. A question mark indicates uncertainty; for example,
<br>
rA@@@? indicates a broadly positive stance on child destruction, with
<br>
some uncertainty. An exclamation mark indicates total disinterest; for
<br>
example, rA! indicates &quot;not interested&quot;. Two scores separated by a slash
<br>
(e.g. @@/%%%%) mean opinion veers between these two extremes.
<br>
<p>Note: the use of @ and % is an attempt to get away from any psychological
<br>
association between positive and negative attributes which may be ascribed
<br>
to some belief. (I switched to it because I caught myself ascribing +/- to
<br>
my own pet positions. Let me know if it causes problems.)
<br>
<p>You can miss out any of the categories you can't be bothered with.
<br>
<p><p>Here are the categories:
<br>
<p>A    Abortion.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@@@@  pro-child destruction
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%%%%  anti-freedom
<br>
<p><p>C   Communism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was going to provide a scale here, but it's virtually impossible to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get any two socialists, communists, or claret-swilling social democrats
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to agree on what is, or is not, leftism without employing surreal number
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theory to follow the branches and schisms. So just feel free to use this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one as you will:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@@@@  I am Karl Marx/Leon Trotsky
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%%%%  I am Joe McCarthy/Tony Blair[*]
<br>
<p><p>D    Drugs (recreational)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@@@@  Legalize everything! Heroin, cocaine, you name it! For free!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%%%%  The War on Drugs has gone soft! Mandatory blood tests in shopping
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;malls, death penalty for repeat offenders! Ban coffee!!
<br>
<p><p>E    Environment.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@@@@  The environment is more important than us humans. We need to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minimize our impact by any means necessary.
<br>

<p><p>O    Objectivism
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carrier in every cooking pot!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@@@@  Absolutely no censorship of any kind, ever, under any

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@@@   Opt-out for national security

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%%%%  The invisible hand will provide. If it won't, who needs it? It's

<br>
<p>U    Union rights
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@@@@  I'm a member of a trades union. Achieve strength through collective 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bargaining! Don't let management trample all over you -- strike if
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary, and strike often!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%%%%  Trade unions are gangsters; shoot 'em all and abolish workplace

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at least I'll never starve.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%%%%  Why should I pay to support a bunch of feckless workshy layabouts? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let 'em buy insurance for themselves! If they're starving, put 'em

<br>

<br>
<p><p>Z   Evangelism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How willing are you to share your beliefs with others? (Think of this as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your &quot;evangelism quotient&quot;).
