<em>&gt; While I understand your point Samantha, I believe my fears

<em>&gt; part of my heritage.  You can take the boy out of Boston
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but can't take the Boston out of the boy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I was mainly reacting to the seeming implication that
<br>
guilt, in either acting too slowly or too quickly, should be a
<br>
significant motivator.  I think it is healthier generally and
<br>
specifically on the REALLY BIG things to be primarily motivated
<br>
by what one wishes to acheive and be part of, by the postive
<br>
rather than the negative.  That sort of motivation is more
<br>
likely to have us act at the right speed and keep us focused on
<br>
what we wish for rather than avoiding &quot;blood on our hands&quot;.  
<br>
<p>I share some misgivings about a Sysop scenario.  I am not sure
<br>
it is a valid and viable &quot;solution&quot;.  But it is not one fear
<br>
over another that provoked my response.  My greatest fear is
<br>
that we act without knowing what it is we want to acheive and
<br>
thus act very unwisely with any/all technologies at our
<br>
disposal.  The price of the attendant errors can be our
<br>
extinction.  But I don't distinquish so much between which form
<br>
of technology is likely to be the most dangerous.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; However, I don't view our perspectives as mutually exclusive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given the current state of the universe (lots of matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and energy for constructing things and lots of physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;space&quot; that can be allocated for security zones).  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it seems like both of our visions are realizable.  However
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what doesn't seem realizable to me is the &quot;resurrection&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of those whose information content is irretrievably lost.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We may be able to recreate a reasonable facsimile of Sasha,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one that I can even &quot;believe&quot; is him, but in my heart I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will always question how close it can be to the original.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I do not know whether we are in a simulation and whether it is
<br>
with or without backups.  Most likely the best course is to
<br>
assume not.  If not and if time travel is impossible (w/o
<br>
creating alternate worldviews) then there is such irreparable
<br>
loss.   However, whether we view it as tragedy that is our
<br>
personal responsibility, that we are guilty for, is another
<br>
question.  I don't believe that such a guilt burden is necessary
<br>
for creating the conditions for avoiding such loss.  I think
<br>
creating this kind of guilt can get in the way and be dangerous
<br>
in and of itself.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The blood of billions *will* be on the hands of those arguing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against cryonics whether or not the reanimations or recreations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are done with or without either nanotech or the SysOp.
</em><br>
<p>No, it won't.  As long as there is freedom then those who don't
<br>
see cryonics as viable have no guilt whatsoever.  Honest opinion
<br>
is not guilt producing.  Forcing others to forego their own
<br>
opinions is cause for guilt.
