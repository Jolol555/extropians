I just wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt; In other words, if a hardcore creationist claims that Newtonian mechanics is due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the peculiar psychology of angels pushing planets around, is he incapable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producing correct calculations using G*M1*M2/r^2 ?
</em><br>
<p>In the spirit of full disclosure, and given Harvey's evident exasperation as expressed
<br>
in another thread (Olga should look into Sasquatch and that WWII bomber on the moon?):
<br>
<p>I'll skip ahead. My last point refers to the historical fact that Newton himself
<br>
was what we'd nowadays call a &quot;hardcore creationist&quot;. By the &quot;poisoned tree&quot; model,
<br>
we should consider Newtonian mechanics suspect forever.
<br>
<p>As a pancritical rationalist, I approve. But there's &quot;suspect&quot;, and then there's
<br>
&quot;suspect&quot;.
<br>
<p>I wasn't so much baiting Harvey as trying to look into the issue of &quot;right, for the
<br>
wrong reasons&quot;--which I think is especially important when people are using slippery
<br>
words along with hidden agendas.
<br>
<p>Comment?
