<br>
<p><em>&gt; My own view of &quot;reparations&quot; is that making me pay for the crimes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of long-dead slave owners is no more rational than holding the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descendents of the slaves responsible.  I have no more control 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over those events than they do.  This &quot;reparations silliness&quot; is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more than just silliness.  It vilifies modern day whites not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for doing something wrong, but just for being the same race as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone who did something wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Some of us who oppose reparations fail, I think, to fully
<br>
take into account one of the chief arguments of those who
<br>
do.  As one of them explained, recently, it's not so much
<br>
individuals, or perhaps even racial groups, that they
<br>
want held accountable.  They want entire *nations*, i.e.,
<br>
the collective state that to them is the legitimate
<br>
embodiment of &quot;the people&quot; to be held accountable.  Quite
<br>
a few libertarians easily forget that collectivists really
<br>
do see states and nations not only as valid abstractions
<br>
(which I do too) but as extremely necessary and very
<br>
vital entities that in many ways are better, wiser, and
<br>
more just than the mere individuals of a region.
