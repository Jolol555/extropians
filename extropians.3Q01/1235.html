<p>
In response to Robert Bradbury’s request that I research
<br>
and write on the issue of climate models and how they will
<br>
affect the sea level, I read a few dozen of these sites.  The
<br>
concensus seems to be that in the next 100 years the sea
<br>
will rise about one foot (30 cm) with an uncertainty of plus
<br>
or minus about one foot (30 cm).
<br>
<p>The images that stick in the public mind of the Statue of
<br>
Liberty torch sticking out of the waves evidently have a
<br>
much larger impact on policy than does the actual science
<br>
or climatology.
<br>
<p>I left out the sites which debunk global warming and sea
<br>
level rise, but they are easy to find.  I did include however
<br>
the Cato Institute paper, which presents an interesting perspective.
<br>
<p>For those who use a unit system that makes sense, please
<br>
forgive the inches and feet.  An inch is about 2.5 cm and
<br>
a foot is just under a third of a meter.
<br>
<p>One thing I found constant throughout this research is an
<br>
underlying assumption among the greenhouse gas experts
<br>
that we must pass to our descendants in the coming centuries
<br>
a planet that is as much unchanged from the present as possible,
<br>
that no change is the ultimate goal.  I have a hard time finding
<br>
researchers who will say that it really is OK if the earth is a
<br>
much different place 1000 years from now.
<br>
<p>Here are the references.
<br>
<p><p><a href="http://www.climatesolutions.org/global_warming_is_here/">http://www.climatesolutions.org/global_warming_is_here/</a>
<br>
<p>Authored by Patrick Mazza and Rhys Roth, 1998, lots
<br>
of references.
<br>
<p>Sea level has risen 4 to 10 inches in the last century.
<br>
This paper assures us that this global warming trend is
<br>
the most serious threat that faces humanity, more serious
<br>
than any military threat, “perhaps the greatest challenge
<br>
in the history of civilization,” but does not really explain
<br>
why life as we know it will end if the planet warms a
<br>
few degrees.

<p>The US Environmental Protection Agency site.  Seems
<br>
fairly balanced and comprehensive.  Highlights:
<br>
<p>Sea level rise has been about 10-25 cm in the last 100
<br>
years.  This site has an interesting feature: that sea level
<br>
rise alone does not tell the whole story.  Subsidence of
<br>
land is important, as well as post glacial rebound.  In areas
<br>
where glaciers melt, the reduced weight on the land causes
<br>
it to rise.  They currently estimate sea level rise at 2.5 to
<br>
3.0 mm/year along the gulf coast, 10 mm/year in Texas-
<br>
Louisianna coasts and a slight dropping of sea level along
<br>
Canadian or Alaskan coasts as a result of post glacial
<br>
rebound.

<br>
<p>This report was published in May 1997.  Highlights:
<br>
<p>2 to 6 degrees warmer by 2100.  Sea level rise:
<br>
<p>2 inches to 1 foot by 2040.
<br>
4 inches to 2 feet by 2075.
<br>
6 inches to 3 feet by 2100.
<br>
Sea level has been rising at about 3 feet per 1000 years
<br>
for the last 5000.
<br>
Last hundred years sea level has risen about 1 foot.
<br>
<p>How unfortunate our ancestors 5000 years ago neglected to
<br>
recognize all the suffering they have caused us by allowing
<br>
the sea level to rise to its current level, 3 feet above where
<br>
it should be.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/globalwarming/climate/">http://www.epa.gov/globalwarming/climate/</a>
<br>
<p>Estimates 2 feet ocean rise in the next century.

<p>This site has a collection of articles on global warming.

<p>NewScientist warns that sea levels could rise up to 6 feet

in the coming centuries.

<p>Scientific American article from August 2000 warns that
<br>
mosquitos will surely gain the upper hand (upper wing?)
<br>
if global temperatures rise a few degrees.

<br>
<p>Aldo Leopold, perhaps the most important environmental
<br>
voice of the twentieth century, wrote, &quot;We face the question
<br>
whether a still higher 'standard of living' is worth its cost in
<br>
things natural, wild, and free. For us of the minority, ...the
<br>
chance to find a pasque-flower is a right as inalienable as
<br>
free speech.&quot;
<br>
<p>ooookaaaayyyyyy.  I still prefer free speech, thank you.
<br>
<p>Senator Timothy Wirth, of Colorado, spelled out the strategy
<br>
in 1988: &quot;What we've got to do in energy conservation is try
<br>
to ride the global warming issue. Even if the theory of global
<br>
warming is wrong, to have approached global warming as if
<br>
it is real means energy conservation, so we will be doing the
<br>
right thing anyway in terms of economic policy and
<br>
environmental policy.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ill be sure to run right out and vote for him.
<br>
<p>This points out the problem that the whole issue is hopelessly
<br>
mired in politics.

<p><a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/reg15n2g.html">http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/reg15n2g.html</a>
<br>
<p>MIT’s Richard Lindzen of the the Cato Institute weights in
<br>
on this issue with such comments as:
<br>
<p>“...fears of massive sea-level increases accompanied many of
<br>
the early discussions of global warming, but those estimates
<br>
have been steadily reduced by orders of magnitude, and now
<br>
it is widely agreed that even the potential contribution of warming
<br>
to sea-level rise would be swamped by other more important
<br>
factors.”
<br>
<p>Lindzen’s paper debunks many of the notions in the popular
<br>
press today regarding global warming.

<p><a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/forcings/altscenario/">http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/forcings/altscenario/</a>
<br>
<p>NASA Goddard Institute argues that the problem of global
<br>
warming could be significantly reduced by stripping the black
<br>
carbon aerosols from power plants.  Clean up coal fired
<br>
power plants.

<p>Explains how the models of the greenhouse effect has been
<br>
reduced by an order of magnitude as climate models have
<br>
been improved.

<br>
<p>A collection of articles on how disasterous would be a small
<br>
rise in sea level, starving seabirds in the Berins Sea, checkerspot
<br>
butterflies would move north, etc.  Not a great deal of scientific
<br>
discussion, a lot of politics.

<br>
<p>A good collection of sources demonstrating the reasons why
<br>
we cannot get scientific concensus on the issues of global
<br>
warming.  Political opinions far outweigh the scientific facts.

<p>Quotes from algore.  Then points out that it is difficult to
<br>
measure how fast sea levels rise because land masses rise
<br>
and fall.

<br>
<p>Dr. Sallie Baliunas of the Heartland Institute points out that
<br>
none of our current models of Earth’s temperature correctly
<br>
backcasts by postdicting global temperatures from the past.
<br>
We simply don’t know yet.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.environmentaldefense.org/programs/GRAP/y3k/">http://www.environmentaldefense.org/programs/GRAP/y3k/</a>
<br>
<p>Predicts a sea level rise of 50 inches in 500 years, 40 inches
<br>
of that in the next 200.
