Bear in mind also that income is used as an indicator of the resources
<br>
available to a person. As the real resources available increase, the means
<br>
for evading reporting this as income also become more diverse and effective.
<br>
That is, those who in some real sense have very high incomes, will usually
<br>
have an official income which is far lower. Gini coefficients may,
<br>
therefore, underestimate in many cases the true variance in the distribution
<br>
of resources.
