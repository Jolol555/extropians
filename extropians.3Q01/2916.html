I agree with Harvey that the article was strongly racist, but I think
<br>
he somewhat missed the point of the essay.  A few quotes for the benefit
<br>
of those who have lost it:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can pay me reparations, Johnny.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To start with, I figure you owe me for three bicycles.
</em><br>
<p>The implication is that the bicycles were stolen by black people,
<br>
and that Johnny Cochran is therefore responsible because he is black,
<br>
a racist claim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A few years back, my middle-school daughter brought home a horrendously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misspelled science hand-out. Now, Johnny: You and I both know that it's easy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make a typo, and write &quot;phenylkeetone&quot; instead of &quot;phenylketone.&quot; But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;feemelkeebome&quot; is stretching it. The errors were of this sort. An
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of chemistry clearly had never rippled the serene surface of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; woman's mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without thinking, I asked, &quot;What color is your teacher?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>His first unthinking reaction at seeing a bad misspelling was suspicion
<br>
that the teacher was black.  This is a racist reaction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But here's a large ravage of slavery, Johnny: Fear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What price do we put on looking over our shoulders? On watching to be sure we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't go one subway stop too far? Warning our girlfriends not to drive on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain streets? Checking the clientele of Seven-Eleven before going in at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; night?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People in, say, Switzerland can walk their streets after dark. We can't. Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What have we got that they don't, that might cause fear?
</em><br>
<p>The implication is that blacks are dangerous criminals, a racist claim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The white guy beaten to death 100 yards from my door last year - they never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caught the killers, but - what you reckon, Johnny? Do you figure it was white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Presbyterian women from the old-ladies' home?
</em><br>
<p>The implication is that black people are more likely to beat someone to
<br>
death than white people, a racist claim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a result of slavery, you have been using our civilization without a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; license.
</em><br>
<p>The implication is that black people are undeserving of the benefits of
<br>
actions of previous generations purely because of their skin color, a
<br>
racist claim.
<br>
<p>Anyway, the essay is so obviously drenched in racism that there is hardly
<br>
any need in pointing out further examples.
<br>
<p>The real issue is that the essay is also intended to be read ironically.
<br>
It is meant to be a satire on racist attitudes.  It aims to mirror some
<br>
of the claims made by those calling for reparations in order to show
<br>
how racist those claims are when the racial roles are inverted.
<br>
<p>The question is, then, whether its use of satire excuses its racism.
<br>
When Swift wrote his &quot;modest proposal&quot; to begin eating children, it
<br>
was satire, and that excuses the hideous cruelty of the suggestion.
<br>
The proposal was not meant seriously.
<br>
<p>I think the problem with the essay is that the attitudes it expresses,
<br>
although meant satirically, are actually very close to real attitudes
<br>
held by real people today and in the recent past.  Many white and asian
<br>
people DO believe that black people are thieving, stupid, violent, and
<br>
undeserving.  It's not expressed very openly now, but a few decades ago
<br>
people made racist jokes and remarks in public.  And views like these
<br>
die hard.
<br>
<p>So here we have an essay expressing views which are hateful in the
<br>
extreme, views which are widely held.  It doesn't work as satire when
<br>
the position being offered satirically is one which is held seriously
<br>
by a significant number of people, one which society has been struggling
<br>
with for decades and centuries.
<br>
<p>Smith's modest proposal wouldn't have been satire if there were actually
<br>
a London cult cooking and eating children, and if his society had engaged
<br>
in a titanic struggle to end that harmful practice.  In the same way,
<br>
an essay which simply expresses hateful, racist attitudes towards blacks
<br>
today cannot be successful as satire.
<br>
<p>Given the sensitivity of the subject and the tremendous wrongs which have
<br>
been committed in the past by racists, attempting a satire on the subject
<br>
of racism is extremely hazardous.  So deep is the divide between races,
<br>
so vicious the hatred which racists have held in their hearts, that it
<br>
is in fact practically impossible to satirize racism.  In a world where
<br>
black people have been tortured and killed merely for the color of their
<br>
skins within recent decades, it is impossible for the satirist to go
<br>
beyond reality.  The attempted satire merely becomes a racist screed.
<br>
<p>For an example of a different attempt at satire in this difficult area,
<br>
see Hofstadter's article on &quot;language purity&quot; at
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/purity.html">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/purity.html</a>.  He tackles
<br>
sexist language by transforming it precisely and dispassionately into
<br>
racist language.
<br>
<p>Hal
<br>
<p>P.S. From dictionary.com:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;rac·ism
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;n. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.The belief that race accounts for differences in human character
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or ability and that a particular race is superior to others.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.Discrimination or prejudice based on race. 
<br>
<p>I think the examples above are consistent with this definition; all
<br>
describe negative characteristics of human beings in terms of their race,
<br>
and imply that whites are superior to blacks in these matters.
