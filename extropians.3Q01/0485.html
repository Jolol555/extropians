<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So without removing a, b, c, you're never going to be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; get rid of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; religiosity of some form.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You may be right. Getting rid of religiosity (I.E., the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; regressive force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; now operating in society) may require more drastic measures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Religious stuff is not the most regressive force.  Thinking you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have the truth corralled and other people are so out to lunch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their truths need to be gotten rid of IS the most regressive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; force operating in society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At what point does altruism overweigh respect for other people's perception
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of reality? It's an interesting question, and one that seems to lurk deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within the problem set for setting up a benevolant anarchy, or even a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functional but more mainstream libertarian society.
</em><br>
<p>One problem is that one needs a more airtight truth and
<br>
perception of truth than others before the question even comes
<br>
up.  I am not a cultural relativist.  I do believe there are
<br>
more and less accurate views of the way it really is.  But in
<br>
most cases we are talking about in DARE threads, altruism is not
<br>
the motivation in not only rejecting but forcefully opposing
<br>
someone else's beliefs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If someone believes that they can fly without assistance, is it right and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proper to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) leave them to kill themselves with their &quot;truth&quot; -- thus allowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary pressures to produce a fitter society, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) force your &quot;truth&quot; on them, thus keeping them alive. With all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences that stem from that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think that this is such an irrelevant question; large sections of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today's society hold &quot;truths&quot; that contradict basic physics. Is it moral,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical, desirable to leave them to these &quot;truths&quot; or does altruism or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selfishness win out?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>More aptly, if someone believes their &quot;soul&quot; survives physical
<br>
death anyway is it right and proper to force them to be
<br>
cryonically stored as they near death?  Does it become any more
<br>
or less right if the vast majority believe that cryonics is the
<br>
way to go and that anything less is memetically inspired
<br>
suicide?  Or, is it proper to insulate children from the
<br>
mystical/religious beliefs of their parents &quot;for their own
<br>
good&quot;?  Who exactly decides what are the proper or at least best
<br>
beliefs and practices?   How and to what degree are these
<br>
decisions enforced?  
<br>
<p>I think freedom should win.  But it would be really good to have
<br>
backups available so people could survive their own stupidity
<br>
and take another shot.
