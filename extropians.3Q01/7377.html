<em>&gt; &gt; I think they probably were actually. The evidence so far suggests most
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them were from Saudi or the UAE (it's confusing because several were
</em><br>
using
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the identities of Saudi citizens who turn ot to be alive and living in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Jeddah etc). It was the Saudis who funded most of the Madrasseh in
</em><br>
Pakistan
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that produced the Taliban. Steve Davies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks Steve. That's very interesting. Of course funding doesn't enter
</em><br>
into
<br>
<em>&gt; the equation as heavily as religious fanaticism since suicidal missions
</em><br>
don't
<br>
<em>&gt; pay.
</em><br>
<p>That wasn't exactly the point I was making. What I was trying to hint at was
<br>
that the religious fanaticism of the Taliban and other Muslim groups is
<br>
largely funded and encouraged by the Saudis (and to a lesser extent the
<br>
UAE). In Pakistan for example the &quot;fundamentalist&quot; mullahs are funded almost
<br>
entirely by Saudi money - the same here in Britain. (I have personal
<br>
knowledge of this as I was married for eight years to a lady whose family
<br>
were Pakistani by origin and with connections to the elite in that country-
<br>
her grandfather had been a close friend of Jinnah). Mike Lorrey asked why
<br>
Saudi or Gulf Arab dissidents don't attack their own countries' rulers
<br>
directly. The answer is (a) they don't fancy tangling with the secret police
<br>
(b) there is a kind of implicit deal being done in the Saudi/Gulf states:
<br>
radicals are allowed to attack the U.S./Israel so long as they don't openly
<br>
attack the Saudi regime. Those who are too honest to accept this are allowed
<br>
to go into exile but continue to get funding from &quot;charitable donations&quot;. I
<br>
was going to launch into a much longer historical rant but the item below
<br>
says it all much better. Steve Davies.
<br>
<p>This business all began in Saudi Arabia
<br>
By Stephen Schwartz
<br>
<p><p>THE first thing to do when trying to understand &quot;Islamic suicide bombers&quot;is
<br>
to forget the cliches about the Muslim taste for martyrdom. It does exist,
<br>
of course, but the desire for paradise is not a safe guide to what motivated
<br>
the appalling suicide attacks on New York and Washington 12 days ago.
<br>
<p>Throughout history, political extremists of all faiths have willingly given
<br>
up their lives simply in the belief that by doing so, whether in bombings or
<br>
in other forms of terror, they would change the course of history, or at
<br>
least win an advantage for their cause. Tamils are not Muslims, but they
<br>
blow themselves up in their war on the government of Sri Lanka; Japanese
<br>
kamikaze pilots in the Second World War were not Muslims, but they flew
<br>
their fighters into US aircraft carriers.
<br>
<p>The Islamo-fascist ideology of Osama bin Laden and those closest to him,
<br>
such as the Egyptian and Algerian &quot;Islamic Groups&quot;, is no more intrinsically
<br>
linked to Islam or Islamic civilisation than Pearl Harbour was to Buddhism,
<br>
or Northern Irish terrorists are to Christianity. Serious Christians don't
<br>
go around killing and maiming the innocent; devout Muslims do not prepare
<br>
for paradise by visiting Florida strip bars and getting drunk, as one of
<br>
last week's terrorist pilots was reported to have done.
<br>
<p>The attacks of September 11 are simply not compatible with orthodox Muslim
<br>
theology, which cautions soldiers &quot;in the way of Allah&quot; to fight their
<br>
enemies face-to-face, without harming non-combatants, women or children.
<br>
<p>Most Muslims, not only in America and Britain, but in the world, are
<br>
law-abiding citizens of their countries - a point stressed by President Bush
<br>
and other American leaders, much to their credit. Nobody on this side of the
<br>
water wants a repeat of the lamented 1941 internment of Japanese Americans.
<br>
<p>Still, the numerical preponderance of Muslims as perpetrators of these
<br>
ghastly incidents is no coincidence. So we have to ask ourselves what has
<br>
made these men into monsters? What has so galvanised violent tendencies in
<br>
the world's second-largest religion (and, in America, the fastest growing
<br>
faith)? Can it really flow from a quarrel over a bit of land in the Middle
<br>
East?
<br>
<p>For Westerners, it seems natural to look for answers in the distant past,
<br>
beginning with the Crusades. But if you ask educated, pious, traditional but
<br>
forward-looking Muslims what has driven their umma, or global community, in
<br>
this direction, many of them will answer you with one word: Wahhabism. This
<br>
is a strain of Islam that emerged not during the Crusades, nor even at the
<br>
time of the anti-Turkish wars of the 17th century, but less than two
<br>
centuries ago. It is violent, it is intolerant, and it is fanatical beyond
<br>
measure. It originated in Arabia, and it is the official theology of the
<br>
Gulf states. Wahhabism is the most extreme form of Islamic fundamentalism.
<br>
<p>Not all Muslims are suicide bombers, but all Muslim suicide bombers are
<br>
Wahhabis - except, perhaps, for some disciples of atheist Leftists posing as
<br>
Muslims in the interests of personal power, such as Yasser Arafat or Saddam
<br>
Hussein. Wahhabism is the Islamic equivalent of the most extreme Protestant
<br>
sectarianism. It is puritan, demanding punishment for those who enjoy any
<br>
music except the drum, and severe punishment up to death for drinking or
<br>
sexual transgressions. It condemns as unbelievers those who do not pray, a
<br>
view that never previously existed in mainstream Islam.
<br>
<p>It is stripped-down Islam, calling for simple, short prayers, undecorated
<br>
mosques, and the uprooting of gravestones (since decorated mosques and
<br>
graveyards lend themselves to veneration, which is idolatry in the Wahhabi
<br>
mind). Wahhabis do not even permit the name of the Prophet Mohammed to be
<br>
inscribed in mosques, nor do they allow his birthday to be celebrated. Above
<br>
all, they hate ostentatious spirituality, much as Protestants detest the
<br>
veneration of miracles and saints in the Roman Church.
<br>
<p>Ibn Abdul Wahhab (1703-1792), the founder of this totalitarian Islamism, was
<br>
born in Uyaynah, in the part of Arabia known as Nejd, where Riyadh is today,
<br>
and which the Prophet himself notably warned would be a source of corruption
<br>
and confusion. (Anti-Wahhabi Muslims refer to Wahhabism as fitna an
<br>
Najdiyyah or &quot;the trouble out of Nejd&quot;.) From the beginning of Wahhab's
<br>
dispensation, in the late 18th century, his cult was associated with the
<br>
mass murder of all who opposed it. For example, the Wahhabis fell upon the
<br>
city of Qarbala in 1801 and killed 2,000 ordinary citizens in the streets.
<br>
<p>In the 19th century, Wahhabism took the form of Arab nationalism v Turks.
<br>
The founder of the Saudi kingdom, Ibn Saud, established Wahhabism as its
<br>
official creed. Much has been made of the role of the US in &quot;creating&quot; Osama
<br>
bin Laden through subsidies to the Afghan mujaheddin, but as much or more
<br>
could be said in reproach of Britain which, three generations before,
<br>
supported the Wahhabi Arabs in their revolt against the Ottomans. Arab
<br>
hatred of the Turks fused with Wahhabi ranting against the &quot;decadence&quot; of
<br>
Ottoman Islam. The truth is that the Ottoman khalifa reigned over a
<br>
multinational Islamic umma in which vast differences in local culture and
<br>
tradition were tolerated. No such tolerance exists in Wahhabism, which is
<br>
why the concept of US troops on Saudi soil so inflames bin Laden.
<br>
<p>Bin Laden is a Wahhabi. So are the suicide bombers in Israel. So are his
<br>
Egyptian allies, who exulted as they stabbed foreign tourists to death at
<br>
Luxor not many years ago, bathing in blood up to their elbows and emitting
<br>
blasphemous cries of ecstasy. So are the Algerian Islamist terrorists whose
<br>
contribution to the purification of the world consisted of murdering people
<br>
for such sins as running a movie projector or reading secular newspapers. So
<br>
are the Taliban-style guerrillas in Kashmir who murder Hindus. The Iranians
<br>
are not Wahhabis, which partially explains their slow but undeniable
<br>
movement towards moderation and normality after a period of utopian and
<br>
puritan revivalism. But the Taliban practise a variant of Wahhabism. They
<br>
employ ancient punishments - such as execution for moral offences - and they
<br>
have a primitive and fearful view of women. The same is true of Saudi
<br>
Arabia's rulers. None of this extremism has been inspired by American
<br>
fumblings in the world, and it has little to do with the tragedies that have
<br>
beset Israelis and Palestinians.
<br>
<p>The Wahhabis have two weaknesses of which the West is largely unaware; an
<br>
Achilles's heel on each foot, so to speak. The first is that the vast
<br>
majority of Muslims in the world are peaceful people who would prefer
<br>
Western democracy in their own countries. They loathe Wahhabism for the same
<br>
reason any patriarchal culture rejects a violent break with tradition. And
<br>
that is the point that must be understood: bin Laden and other Wahhabis are
<br>
not defending Islamic tradition; they represent an ultra-radical break in
<br>
the direction of a sectarian utopia. Thus, they are best described as
<br>
Islamo-fascists, although they have much in common with Bolsheviks.
<br>
<p>The Bengali Sufi writer Zeeshan Ali has described the situation touchingly:
<br>
&quot;Muslims from Bangladesh in the US, just like any other place in the world,
<br>
uphold the traditional beliefs of Islam but, due to lack of instruction,
<br>
keep quiet when their beliefs are attacked by Wahhabis in the US who all of
<br>
a sudden become 'better' Muslims than others. These Wahhabis go even further
<br>
and accuse their own fathers of heresy, sin and unbelief. And the young
<br>
children of the immigrants, when they grow up in this country, get exposed
<br>
only to this one-sided version of Islam and are led to think that this is
<br>
the only Islam. Naturally a big gap is being created every day that silence
<br>
is only widening.&quot; The young, divided between tradition and the call of the
<br>
new, opt for &quot;Islamic revolution&quot; and commit themselves to their
<br>
self-destruction, combined with mass murder.
<br>
<p>The same influences are brought to bear throughout the 10-million-strong
<br>
Muslim community in America, as well as those in Europe. In the US, 80 per
<br>
cent of mosques are estimated by the Sufi Hisham al-Kabbani, born in Lebanon
<br>
and now living in the US, to be under the control of Wahhabi imams, who
<br>
preach extremism, and this leads to the other point of vulnerability:
<br>
Wahhabism is subsidised by Saudi Arabia, even though bin Laden has sworn to
<br>
destroy the Saudi royal family. The Saudis have played a double game for
<br>
years, more or less as Stalin did with the West during the Second World War.
<br>
They pretended to be allies in a struggle against Saddam Hussein while
<br>
spreading Wahhabi ideology, just as Stalin promoted an &quot;antifascist&quot;
<br>
coalition with the US while carrying out espionage and subversion on
<br>
American territory. The motive was the same: the belief that the West was or
<br>
is decadent and doomed.
<br>
<p>One major question is never asked in American discussions of Arab terrorism:
<br>
what is the role of Saudi Arabia? The question cannot be asked because
<br>
American companies depend too much on the continued flow of Saudi oil, while
<br>
American politicians have become too cosy with the Saudi rulers.
<br>
<p>Another reason it is not asked is that to expose the extent of Saudi and
<br>
Wahhabi influence on American Muslims would compromise many Islamic clerics
<br>
in the US. But it is the most significant question Americans should be
<br>
asking themselves today. If we get rid of bin Laden, whom do we then have to
<br>
deal with? The answer was eloquently put by Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr, professor
<br>
of political science at the University of California at San Diego, and
<br>
author of an authoritative volume on Islamic extremism in Pakistan: &quot;If the
<br>
US wants to do something about radical Islam, it has to deal with Saudi
<br>
Arabia. The 'rogue states' [Iraq, Libya, etc] are less important in the
<br>
radicalisation of Islam than Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the single most
<br>
important cause and supporter of radicalisation, ideologisation, and the
<br>
general fanaticisation of Islam.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From what we now know, it appears not one of the suicide pilots in New York
</em><br>
and Washington was Palestinian. They all seem to have been Saudis, citizens
<br>
of the Gulf states, Egyptian or Algerian. Two are reported to have been the
<br>
sons of the former second secretary of the Saudi embassy in Washington. They
<br>
were planted in America long before the outbreak of the latest Palestinian
<br>
intifada; in fact, they seem to have begun their conspiracy while the Middle
<br>
East peace process was in full, if short, bloom. Anti-terror experts and
<br>
politicians in the West must now consider the Saudi connection.
