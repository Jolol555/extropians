JR said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From an evolutionary psychology standpoint, human values evolve from
</em><br>
human needs, which are tied to biological needs.
<br>
<p>Which is a pretty good answer the question I asked. My own answer would
<br>
probably be fairly similar, though I'd distinguish (as you might, too)
<br>
various kinds of needs. For example, my needs as a particular biological
<br>
organism might differ from what was needed by my ancestors for inclusive
<br>
fitness in the evolutionary environment.
<br>
<p>JR added:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I suspect you have your own opinions about where values come from.
</em><br>
Regardless
<br>
of where they come from, human values are not necessary for pure
<br>
intelligence,
<br>
and my conjecture is that they interfere with pure intelligence (which is
<br>
the
<br>
ability to solve problems autonomously).
<br>
<p>JR, I'm just trying to get a handle on your thinking. I *think* I now see
<br>
why you say an AI with values would be (in a sense) &quot;weak AI&quot;. Actually, I
<br>
assumed you had something like this in mind but wasn't sure.
<br>
<p>You are, of course, redefining the terms &quot;strong AI&quot; and &quot;weak AI&quot;, but I
<br>
realise you are doing so deliberately for rhetorical effect, so that's okay.
<br>
<p>Can I take this a bit further, however? You seem to be putting a position
<br>
that the only, or the overriding, value is the ability to solve problems.
<br>
But isn't this a value judgment? I'm not trying to be cute, just trying to
<br>
see how you get to this point. It seems odd to me. I place a great value on
<br>
intelligence/problem solving ability as well, but I also think there's a lot
<br>
of truth in the dictum that I can't quite remember sufficiently well to
<br>
quote accurately from Hume - the one about reason being the slave of the
<br>
passions. The passions, in turn, doubtless have a biological basis. I'm
<br>
finding it very hard imagining an intelligence totally devoid of &quot;passions&quot;
<br>
or why it would be a good thing. I'm not even as confident as you that such
<br>
an intelligence would have greater problem-solving power. What would
<br>
*motivate* it to solve problems if it had no values at all? Shouldn't it at
<br>
least be motivated by curiosity? Moreover, why should we give up our values
<br>
which are based wholly or partly on our biological interests? Also, don't
<br>
you think, given that a lot of problem solving uses hypothetico-deductive
<br>
reasoning, not purely deductive reasoning, that it might be very hard
<br>
developing a system capable of conjectures and yet with no values? It seems
<br>
to me that even being conscious would give the system something analogous to
<br>
biological interests. If the system isn't conscious, why should we value it
<br>
except as a useful tool to our ends, based on *our* values? Etc?
<br>
<p>I, in my turn, suspect that you may have answers to these questions, but I
<br>
haven't seen anything convincing from you so far. Do you want to spell it
<br>
out?
