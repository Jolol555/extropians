<p>At first glance a Ghandian approach may have the taste of &quot;deep 20 th
<br>
century&quot;. It may remind you of a remote peaceful hippy resistance and sound
<br>
awkward to our future loving ears but it could be successfull in a
<br>
country that is far away from 21th century way of life. Choosing the
<br>
humanitarian raisin bomber option may cause laughter, but even if the
<br>
Taliban fascists steal some of the food and clothes away from the poor, they
<br>
cannot take it all, there should be enough hidden raisin bomb craters left.

<p><em>&gt;This analysis seems to proceed as if THE LUCIFER PRINCIPLE was never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;written; such largesse, reminding the recipients about who is currently on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;top in the pecking order, engenders jealousy, resentment and envy, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gratitude.  It is likely that such a move could be counterproductive, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cause even more children (even if the same percentage indulged in the

</em><br>
<p>Even if it seems counterproductive right now and even if more children
<br>
might develop the way you describe it, there should be a force
<br>
who shows mercy first. You cannot expect anything from a people that is so
<br>
badly suppressed like the Afghan poor. A couple of days ago I saw a BBC
<br>
report by an Afghan born British journalist. She secretly filmed daily
<br>
live in Afghanistan in June 2001. It`s breaking your heart. Besides children
<br>
dying of starvation, men, women and children being slaughtered in villages
<br>
where bases of the Northern alliance fighters are suspected, it is the
<br>
permanent suppression that makes you sick. No woman is allowed to work and
<br>
every girl at the age of 12 must definitely quit classes in school. Friday
<br>
afternoon a blood thirsty crowd gathers in a football stadium, built from
<br>
international funds, and watches thiefs being hanged on the goal posts and a
<br>
woman accused of adultery being shot kneeling down at the penalty line of
<br>
the footbal field, men whose throats are cut, kneeling down there, too. And
<br>
the people are watching - it`s Friday afternoon - and yelling with
<br>
approval. And all these scenes were secretely filmed. This is real. What a
<br>
brutalization. They must see some signs that man can feel and act different.
