Zero Powers asked:
<br>
<em>&gt;Do you know how much more is needed?  Is anyone running a tally?  There 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might be some generous benefactor on the list who is willing and able to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;top it off.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Robert Ettinger has stated he will not be running a public tally.  This is because it could cause some people to hold off in the hopes others will donate.  
<br>
<p>I think there would be a certain appeal to letting people know how much has been donated and how much still needs to be.  I suppose my understanding of human psychology would support this view! lol  I sincerely hope people will not hold back because of the way Mr. Ettinger has decided to do things.
<br>
<p>He will announce when the needed sum has been reached.  Then he will give a pro rata sum back to each donor based on how much &quot;over&quot; the donations went.
<br>
<p>I will repost below two emails by Robert Ettinger regarding the fundraising project.  Just in case some of you missed them.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>

<p>SAVING JAMES SWAYZE
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Most Cryonet readers are probably familiar with the James Swayze
<br>
&nbsp;situation.  James is almost completely paralyzed, and under federally
<br>
&nbsp;subsidized care. That care has a price.  All his earnings have been taken
<br>
&nbsp;away, and whatever he might somehow manage to earn will also be taken
<br>
&nbsp;away.  His health is precarious, but his determination and his
<br>
&nbsp;intelligence are not.  He learned about cryonics, and the possibility
<br>
&nbsp;that through cryonics he might yet overcome his unfortunate situation. 
<br>
&nbsp;He wants to try.  The only problem is that he can't afford it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;CI, and I personally, would very much like to see Mr. Swayze get his
<br>
&nbsp;chance.  The difficulty is that no cryonics organization can simply
<br>
&nbsp;provide suspensions free of charge.  Suspensions are expensive, and that
<br>
&nbsp;expense is ongoing, as daily care and maintenance and supplies are needed
<br>
&nbsp;to safeguard patients.  Cryonics organizations cannot get into the habit of
<br>
&nbsp;taking financial losses, even for charitable purposes.  We saw that
<br>
&nbsp;happen many years ago with the Chatsworth situation.  There, charity
<br>
&nbsp;patients were accepted.  But with no money to fund their care, or pay
<br>
&nbsp;company bills, the company failed, and those patients and all the
<br>
&nbsp;patients were lost.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;CI has determined that that will never happen to our patients, and so it
<br>
&nbsp;is CI policy that funding, in every case, has to be adequate and certain.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I and a number of others at CI have been trying to come up
<br>
&nbsp;with some way to give James his chance.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;My own ideas have gone through several phases.  At one point I thought CI
<br>
&nbsp;might reasonably give James a price break, or even fund his
<br>
&nbsp;suspension in exchange for his active help in public relations.  But as
<br>
&nbsp;I learned more about his situation,  it became clear that this might not
<br>
&nbsp;be fair either to CI or to him.  From our point of view, the potential
<br>
&nbsp;value of his PR help is really uncertain -- it could be considerable, or
<br>
&nbsp;it could be negligible, and there is a legal question as to whether he
<br>
&nbsp;can earn anything at all without government regulations interfering. From
<br>
&nbsp;his point of view, the demands on his time might be counter-productive. 
<br>
&nbsp;His health varies from bad to very bad, and forcing someone in poor
<br>
&nbsp;health to work for what might be a very long time is neither wise nor
<br>
&nbsp;fair.  He ought to use his time as he sees fit, perhaps to work on his
<br>
&nbsp;inventions, perhaps just to extract a bit of enjoyment from life.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Rudi Hoffman did a lot of work on life insurance possibilities, providing
<br>
&nbsp;some interesting potential for future problem cases, but leaving gaps in
<br>
&nbsp;James' case, about which I won't go into in detail here.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;So I think now that it just comes down to individuals coming together
<br>
&nbsp;voluntarily to donate the cost of a CI suspension for him.  To make that
<br>
&nbsp;possible, I've made a personal decision. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Just under $10,000 has been pledged so far. The total required --
<br>
&nbsp;suspension fee, membership fee, and local and transportation costs -- we
<br>
&nbsp;figure $33,000.  That leaves us $23,000 short, assuming all the previous
<br>
&nbsp;pledgers make good.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;I now make the following commitment.  If we can get another $10,000 in 
<br>
&nbsp;donations, paid to CI along with payments for the previous pledges (total $20,000), 
<br>
&nbsp;then I will personally make up the difference (i.e., fund up to $13,000 additional).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;I don't want to be misunderstood.  I hope we can get a total donation sum of 
<br>
&nbsp;$33,000.  But if we achieve at least $20,000, and we seem to be nearly 
<br>
&nbsp;halfway there already, then I will make up the difference.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Now, a few particulars. Every plan can be argued and nitpicked back and
<br>
&nbsp;forth, but I want to avoid argument and get cracking, so the following is
<br>
&nbsp;not just an idea or a suggestion but the plan:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;1. We want donations, not pledges -- cash, not promises. Please send your
<br>
&nbsp;donations as soon as possible, payable to Cryonics Institute. (On the
<br>
&nbsp;memo line of the check, usually at the lower left -- not on the payee
<br>
&nbsp;line -- you may write &quot;James Swayze Fund.&quot;) Mail it to Cryonics
<br>
&nbsp;Institute, 24355 Sorrentino Court, Clinton Township, Michigan 48035. You
<br>
&nbsp;will of course receive an acknowledgement. Donors' names and amounts will
<br>
&nbsp;be kept confidential if requested -- though we'd prefer to thank you
<br>
&nbsp;publicly and make your generosity public at some point.  Setting an example 
<br>
&nbsp;for others could inspire others to help.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;2. We do not plan to announce the status of the fund until the goal of
<br>
&nbsp;$20,000 is conclusively passed. Otherwise, obviously, some potential
<br>
&nbsp;donors might hold off, hoping their own contributions will not be needed.
<br>
&nbsp;Please, don't hold off for any reason -- James' health is much more
<br>
&nbsp;problematical than that of most people, and it would be ghastly if he
<br>
&nbsp;were to miss his chance by a hair. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;3. Donations are not refundable, except as follows. If donations should
<br>
&nbsp;happen to exceed $33,000, the overage will be refunded pro rata (the same
<br>
&nbsp;percentage  of each donation will go back to each donor). If James should 
<br>
&nbsp;die before the necessary amount is reached and he is not suspended by CI, all
<br>
&nbsp;donations will be refunded. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;I hope that all $33,000 can be raised.  But at the moment raising even
<br>
&nbsp;$10,000 (beyond the current pledges) could secure a cryonic suspension, and 
<br>
&nbsp;the possiblity of a new life, for James Swayze.  $10,000 dollars seems like a 
<br>
&nbsp;lot of money, I know.  But there are said to be approaching a thousand people 
<br>
&nbsp;in the world who are signed-up members of cryonics organizations.  Some are 
<br>
&nbsp;comfortably off, some of them are quite wealthy, and all of them are able to meet   the costs of membership and insurance.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;If each one sends in what he can afford without hardship, James Swayze would be  able to realize the hope all of us  have -- a chance of a new and healthy life in an  amazing future. We've all  seen a lot of disagreement among cryonicists on this list.   Let's put it behind us, and pull together this once, to help a friend--a man of 
<br>
&nbsp;extraordinary spirit, who needs to have his extraordinarily bad luck mitigated.
