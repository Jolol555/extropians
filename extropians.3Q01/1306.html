In his review Robin Hanson wrote:
<br>
&quot;...why not just postulate that humans evolved a tendency to gullibility
<br>
about the supernatural, in order to signal our cooperativeness?
<br>
<p>That is, it may be hard to fake a tendency toward supernatural belief, and
<br>
such beliefs may tend to make you more cooperative, for fear of punishment
<br>
by moralistic supernatural observers. If so, it can be in your gene's
<br>
interest for you to tend to hold such beliefs, even if that sometimes
<br>
induces wasteful actions. (Your genes might, for example, just tip the
<br>
balance toward believing in entities that violate ontological assumptions.)
<br>
Supernatural beliefs would then be a credible signal of cooperativeness.
<br>
Irrationality would be a signal, similar to the way emotional expressions
<br>
can signal commitment, or they way people seem prone to overestimate their
<br>
own abilities, in order to impress potential allies.
<br>
<p>Perhaps Boyer will think my proposed modification to be of little
<br>
consequence relative to his main purpose of explaining the sorts of
<br>
religious beliefs that people have. And as I said, Boyer deserves credit for
<br>
substantial progress on just this question. But I think religion will not
<br>
really be explained until we have an answer to the crucial question of why
<br>
people seem so much more willing to take fiction for fact in this area.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure from your summary, but I take it that perhaps the most
<br>
plausible development of your hypothesis is that supernatural beliefs are a
<br>
credible signal of intragroup cooperativeness as opposed to intergroup
<br>
cooperativeness. As a corollary, we might suppose that differences in
<br>
religious belief discourage defection to other groups. A skeptic might
<br>
wonder whether this can be so given that conflict over religious differences
<br>
seems such a heavy price to pay. The obvious rebuttal is that groups that
<br>
did not employ as developed a system of signalling cooperativeness did not
<br>
survive. Let's hope that modern forms of rationality tip the scales in our
<br>
favour! One way to confirm the 'social cohesion hypothesis' would be to look
<br>
for instances of intragroup (defined by adherence to a single religion)
<br>
break-down. Looking at the historical record this view ought to favour a
<br>
higher incidence of conflicts spawning new religions. In other words,
<br>
religious differences are said to spawn numerous wars, but it may be the
<br>
case that regularly wars spawn religious differences.
