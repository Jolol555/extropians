<em>&gt; &gt;The

<em>&gt; &gt; ethical is most serious: you assume that human lives can have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; negative value, and do an essentially utilitarian calculation not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of happiness, but simply of utility towards a certain goal. Humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not promoting this goal are a vaste of resources and a potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; threat, so eliminate them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First off, I don't see where Robert assumes that humans are a vast resource,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather, he seems to be asking us to trade off some lives now for many more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live in the future. Furthermore, Anders claims that Robert has made an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical mistake, but this is a controversial claim in ethics. Robert assumes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a consequentialist position, i.e., he assumes that the right act here is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one that has the best consequence, namely, the one that saves the most lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the end. Anders, as far as I can tell, expresses the deontological view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which says that some actions are morally obligatory regardless of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences:
</em><br>
<p>Roberts mistake is not that he made the wrong ethical conclusion, but
<br>
that his reason was quite non-ethical. 
<br>
<p>I regard myself as a consequentialist (I could never stomach
<br>
deontology). But I look not just as the first order consequences but
<br>
also the second and higher order: what matters is the entire state of
<br>
the world after an act, and how this will likely develop. From this form
<br>
of consequensialism a kind of deontology develops, e.g. killing
<br>
non-initiators of force has a very negative and robust expectation value
<br>
in the long run, so we can express this in the statement that killing
<br>
non-initiators is wrong. Even if we re-do this derivation for Roberts
<br>
scenario we end up with the same result. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     With this distinction we can see that Anders may have been a bit swift
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in pulling the &quot;fascist card&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A transhumanism not based on this core does not deserve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humanism part of the name. And a transhumanism that bases itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the utilitarist approach of using humans as means to an end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather than ends in themselves becomes the ideological twin of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fascism, with the sole difference that the singularity takes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; place of the national community in the ideological structure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To make this charge of an &quot;ideological twin&quot; stick Anders would need to show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least (a) that transhumanism is necessarily deontological in structure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and (b) that Robert intended the consequence to be weighted is that of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideal, namely, the singularity, rather than the lives that the singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will save. However, (a) is an open question in my mind and, as I've said,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert's discussion seems predicated on the assumption that the singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will save a great number of lives. That is, it is to misunderstand (or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read carefully) the form of Robert's argument:  the singularity is the means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the end of saving lives, it is not that sacrificing lives are the means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the goal of the singularity. 
</em><br>
<p>What I was referring to here was not whether the detailled internal
<br>
ethical structure of fascism would be isomorphic with debased
<br>
transhumanism, but to point out that once that line was crossed, the
<br>
resulting ideology would be for all practical purposes the same.  And I
<br>
did not use the term fascism just to tar Robert (who I deeply respect in
<br>
other areas) but because I really saw the similarity between a &quot;humans
<br>
as means for the singularity&quot; transhumanism and a &quot;humans as means for
<br>
the national community&quot; fascism. Even if Robert thinks the reason the
<br>
singularity is good is because it somehows limits dying, that is not
<br>
very different from the more practical minded fascist (and other
<br>
collectivist) ideas that view the &quot;national community&quot; as involving a
<br>
better life for everybody. 
<br>
<p>What would your opinion be on a fascist transhumanist (not Robert in
<br>
advocating the singularity as a good any sacrifice might be worth? What
<br>
would your *ethical* arguments against his position be?
<br>
<p>The problem here is not that Robert is wrong or made an inflammatory
<br>
post, but that in the current list culture there is precious few
<br>
attempts to shore up the ethics of transhumanism in a way that makes it
<br>
workable and protects it against merging with unpalatable and dangerous
<br>
ideologies. If transhumanism has no generally accepted core ideas and no
<br>
ethics, what is there to distinguish it from (say) technological
<br>
fascism? That is why I more and more think we have to abandon the term
<br>
transhumanism as a designator for ourselves and instead concentrate on
<br>
more well-defined systems such as extropianism.
