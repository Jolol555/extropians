<em>&gt;From: Mike Lorrey &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20SOCIETY:%20The%20privatization%20of%20public%20security%20in%20South%20America?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108170321.f7H3LpB02494@pheidippides.md.chalmers.se&gt;">mlorrey@datamann.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I can confirm this phenomenon, but also that there is a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relationship between robbers and their victims in those countries than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here. A business associate was in Rio visiting freinds when a robber
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with a pistol entered the house (which was surrounded by a high wall and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alarmed gates) and robbed each person at gunpoint. Everyone quietly gave
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the theif their money and jewelry, and the theif calmly left the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;premises. Afterwards, my freind Andy asked why nobody defended
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves, and they replied with shocked looks, &quot;We just give them what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they want and they go away, and nobody gets hurt.&quot; In reaction to his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dumbfounded look, they asked, &quot;How does it work in the US?&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Andy replied,&quot;In the US, if you give them your money, they then shoot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you anyways, so nobody can ID them to police.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure it's so much a matter of a relationship between robbers and
<br>
victims as much as one between victims and law enforcement. Given the
<br>
major corruption of security forces, and their inefficiency and lack of
<br>
resources to deal with reported crimes, most people don't bother to
<br>
report things to the police. I'm quoting from thin air so I may be off-mark,
<br>
but I think in Argentina only 1 in 5 crimes are actually reported, and of
<br>
those reported, 1 in 15 are solved. The judiciary is also a complete mess,
<br>
and many arrested small crime offenders get released as the maximum term
<br>
for &quot;preventive prison&quot; (being hold until trial happens) passes without
<br>
the prosecutors being able to pursue the trial. Violent robberies have been
<br>
more related to &quot;career robbers&quot; (lots of banking assaults in Argentina) or to
<br>
inexperienced new young robbers that get scared too easily and shoot first,
<br>
rob second, without much sense or reason. The conexions of small robbers (and
<br>
even of bank gangs) with police officers who act as controllers or pawn
<br>
brokers for the stolen goods is sadly not uncommon, on top of it all.
