<em>&gt; &gt; I was somewhat saddened by the fact that he claimed that the country's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; closest friend was Great Britain, as opposed to Canada.  However, the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the matter is that while the majority of Canadian people do support the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; US and any action it takes, the Canadian government has been anything but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forthright in mirroring this support.  I am also slightly concerned that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Canada may have (inadvertently) harbored some of the terrorists involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the hijackings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     As a Canadian I must say that I was saddened by the fact that we were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not mentioned at all. It does seem that Canada inadvertently harbored some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the terrorists but we are not alone in this--it looks like some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists may have been fairly well traveled.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't exactly call it 'inadvertent', nor is this the first time.
<br>
These guys slip through (as did that Ressam character and his buddies
<br>
who tried slipping in on the Millenium to do some attacks) specificially
<br>
because Canada has some contradictory regs: it rejects immigrants who
<br>
are thought to be risks, but won't send back rejects to countries that
<br>
are violent. It stands to reason that a violent immigrant is one of the
<br>
reasons those countries are violent. Letting them stay to spread the
<br>
violence is a dumb idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     We were out driving the other day counting American and Canadian flags.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our unscientific survey concluded that they are in about equal numbers right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now. A local newspaper printed an American flag and many people (including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your truly) taped them in their livingroom windows.
</em><br>
<p>A lot of Canadian friends have shown support. I hope they show enough to
<br>
close the loopholes in the immigration/refugee system.
