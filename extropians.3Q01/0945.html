<p>Assimilation and transformation seems to be the most successful strategy
<br>
in the world of memes. IMHO, religions tend to drift toward harmlessness
<br>
the more populist and egalitarian they get. Fundamentalism is an effect
<br>
of cultural polarization, isolation, and change, which is something we
<br>
are likely to see much more of in the near future. Expanding internet
<br>
access to as many places is of paramount importance to mitigating
<br>
fundamentalism. One problem of this is that the immense amount of
<br>
information mandates the use of filters, but filters based upon what the
<br>
user wants to see contributes to isolation and fundamentalism. The Flynn
<br>
Effect and other indices indicate that younger generations have greater
<br>
ability to adapt and assimilate, but sufficient efforts at education of
<br>
high trust paradigms is needed to preserve progressive culture as those
<br>
that are less so become more connected.
