<em>&gt; I also note a lot of variation in this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quote, another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indication that people are not getting back to the original sources.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I have found enough sources to demonstrate that this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real.
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't matter if this particular statement is real or not, I've heard more
<br>
then enough statements from blacks where they discriminate based on race to
<br>
convince me that what I am hearing them correctly. Ill not bother going into
<br>
further details because I see people get distracted from the initial
<br>
questions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; now can we get back an address the issue? Is Jesse Jackson a racist?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is almost a trick question.  Jackson's original quote 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said that he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ashamed to have this distinction between blacks and whites in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his mind.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the context of the statement didn't have anything to do with him
<br>
being upset at his discriminating thoughts. He was in fact upset with the
<br>
reality that blacks IN FACT commit more crime. This is what pained him.
<br>
Reference:
<br>
<p>JESSE JACKSON CANDID CONFESSION-After his own home and neighborhood were
<br>
invaded by street punks Jesse Jackson dedicated himself to fighting
<br>
black-on-black crime. He confesses: &quot;There is nothing more painful for me
<br>
than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start to think about
<br>
robbery and then look around and see it's somebody white and feel relieved.
<br>
How humiliating.&quot; (1/17 USN&amp;WR). Reminiscent of what he said in 1975, &quot;A
<br>
black man selling dope hurts communities more than a white man dangling a
<br>
rope&quot;, Jackson now says: &quot;We lose more lives to young blacks killing each
<br>
other annually than to the sum total of lynchings in the history of the
<br>
country&quot; (12/19 Parade). Statistics show that blacks and Hispanics commit a
<br>
very disproportionate share of felonies 
<br>
<p>I think its crystal clear that he trying to convince the blacks that were
<br>
actually committing the crimes to stop. If you see anything in here about
<br>
him being upset for his own mental processes AND how they were in error,
<br>
please point them out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He admits some racist thoughts, but is fighting to end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racism.
</em><br>
<p>Cant conclude he had racist thoughts till we nail down the definition. Were
<br>
a bit premature here.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There are different definitions for different words depending 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on who you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask.
</em><br>
<p>That's kind of what were trying to fix here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't know that racism requires genetic root causes.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't decided if they believe behavior is more caused by genetics or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture.  It probably is a mixture of both.  If you insist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that racism be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited to genetic causes, then I think hardly anything would ever be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered racist.
</em><br>
<p>Those things considered racist are the things that fit the definition. To
<br>
not want to release your grip on the word because your left with some
<br>
linguistic void isn't an issue. Besides, like I said, frequent and
<br>
fraudulent use of the term just dilutes it to meaninglessness. Keep in mind,
<br>
as we have discussed, there's a ton of other words out there that are MUCH
<br>
more accurate for describing a majority of these racist accusations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is he discriminating based on race?  In this example, yes he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is.  Is it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fair or accurate discrimination?  No, it is not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Statistically speaking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blacks may commit more crimes than whites.  Does that mean he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the white guy is not going to assault him?  Does that mean he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the black guy is going to assault him?  Neither assumption is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valid.  Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if one is statistically more likely to occur, it is not a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific basis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for predicition.  The methodology that observing a person's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; race will help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predict their criminal behavior is wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Ill refer you over to the racial profiling thread on this one... The
<br>
profiling dept. at the FBI catches a LOT of criminals with this method and
<br>
they don't stop with race... They use everything they can. Race, income,
<br>
profession, gender, etc... It does in fact work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More to the point, the race of the person is not indicative of future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior.  It is not statistically predictive.  It may be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true that blacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commit more crimes than whites.  However, most black people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are law-abiding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens, as are most white people.  Poverty would be a more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicator.  A white street bum would probably be more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous than a rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black businessman or a black preacher.  When we adjust for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factors, we would find that rich black business men are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably no more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to commit crime than rich white business men.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not going to question this as I feel it is true. I never said that
<br>
blacks were genetically predetermined to be disposed to commit more crime,
<br>
but I am interested in your sources where these studies corrected for income
<br>
level. Would love to see them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Therefore, I don't really care if we call these attitudes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racist, prejudice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or discrimination.  To link unrelated traits to race is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racist.
</em><br>
<p>I'm afraid I don't understand this, how are prejudice, bigotry, and
<br>
discriminations NOT related to racism? And how is linking them together
<br>
racists. If I state that a true racist is prejudice, that makes me a racist
<br>
according to the above. I just linked one of these &quot;unrelated&quot; concepts
<br>
(prejudice) to racism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions based on race rather than people's individual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merits is racist.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see much value in arguing whether something is racist, racially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prejudiced or racially discriminatory.  Let's just say that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is just plain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientifically invalid, and leave it at that.
</em><br>
<p>I think statistics very much play a role, delimiting this role is the hard
<br>
part.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is there any good reason to split hairs with these terms, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to practice prejudice and discrimination while claiming not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be racist?
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>A little jab with an argument through intimidation there? I'm not biting. My
<br>
desire to split hairs on this is I think it is required to sort out this
<br>
problem where the term racism is used for everything from describing Mark
<br>
Furman to describing a cheeseburger.
