<p>Yeah, like those idiots who suggested that a rocket could take a man to the 
<br>
moon! What complete fools they must have been! To even consider sitting on 
<br>
top  of what would amount to a gigantic bomb and hope that it went off in a 
<br>
controlled fashion -- how impractical is that! Then the idea of sitting in 
<br>
a tin can for several days where the tiniest object could easily puncture 
<br>
the habitation and the atmosphere bleed away in short order -- if it didn't 
<br>
simply explode. Imagine how delicate it would be -- a major disaster could 
<br>
ensue if just one of millions of parts went wrong. Boy it's lucky no short 
<br>
sighted twits put that hare-brained scheme into practice... oh wait, they 
<br>
did, didn't they. :-)
<br>
<p>Do control yourself Doug. Eric wasn't suggesting it be put into practice 
<br>
tomorrow, or that your rocketry budget be reallocated to his transport idea 
<br>
-- he was just coming up with some interesting thoughts. Of course they are 
<br>
bound to have some impracticalities, but if everybody simply shit on 
<br>
blue-sky speculations that people make... well we would probably still be 
<br>
living in caves... you certainly wouldn't have your rockets... and I 
<br>
wouldn't have my computers.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
