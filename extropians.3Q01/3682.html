[A lot of good stuff that I won't respond to individually]

<em>&gt; I think its crystal clear that he trying to convince the blacks that were

</em><br>
<em>&gt; him being upset for his own mental processes AND how they were in error,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please point them out.
</em><br>
<p>I concede this point.  I assumed that Jesse Jackson would want to be able to
<br>
see people without reference to color.  I assumed that he was both wishing
<br>
blacks would stop committing crimes and wishing he didn't feel that way.
<br>
But I can't prove this from his words alone.  I am reading more into his
<br>
words based on what I think he would mean.  You are right on this one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't know that racism requires genetic root causes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; haven't decided if they believe behavior is more caused by genetics or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; culture.  It probably is a mixture of both.  If you insist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that racism be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; limited to genetic causes, then I think hardly anything would ever be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; considered racist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those things considered racist are the things that fit the definition. To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not want to release your grip on the word because your left with some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; linguistic void isn't an issue. Besides, like I said, frequent and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fraudulent use of the term just dilutes it to meaninglessness.
</em><br>
<p>Good point.  The fact that the restrictive definition of the word eliminates
<br>
it use is not a good reason to dispute the definition.  My concern was that
<br>
the restrictive definition excludes most common usage of the word.  Maybe
<br>
this is your point, that there are almost no current examples of racism if
<br>
you define the word so strictly.  I don't know how to argue the &quot;true&quot;
<br>
meaning of the word if people don't agree on the dictionary definitions.  I
<br>
don't have a good way to define this word, but I always thought racisms was
<br>
an attitude or action for against people based on race.  I think the
<br>
requirement for a genetic cause is too restrictive and borders on redefining
<br>
the word differently than previous usage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Therefore, I don't really care if we call these attitudes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; racist, prejudice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or discrimination.  To link unrelated traits to race is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; racist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm afraid I don't understand this, how are prejudice, bigotry, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discriminations NOT related to racism? And how is linking them together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racists. If I state that a true racist is prejudice, that makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me a racist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to the above. I just linked one of these &quot;unrelated&quot; concepts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (prejudice) to racism.
</em><br>
<p>You misunderstood my point.  I wasn't referring to these words when I said
<br>
&quot;unrelated traits&quot;.  I meant linking race to unrelated trades like honesty,
<br>
job performance or other assumptions that might be made on race rather than
<br>
actual individual performance.
<br>
<p>For these words, my point is that they *are* very related.  I think it is
<br>
splitting hairs to try to determine whether some negative attitude or
<br>
actions is racist, prejudice or discrimination.  Some people seem to want to
<br>
distinguish these concepts, with some good and some bad, but I think they
<br>
are too intertwined to distinguish them.  Arguing that someone isn't racist,
<br>
but they are merely prejudiced or discriminatory seems to be avoiding the
<br>
R-word without maintaining the same behavior under another name.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't see much value in arguing whether something is racist, racially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; prejudiced or racially discriminatory.  Let's just say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it is just plain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientifically invalid, and leave it at that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think statistics very much play a role, delimiting this role is the hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part.
</em><br>
<p>I don't want to eliminate statistics.  Statistics are wonderful for
<br>
describing whole groups of people.  However, it is useless in describing
<br>
individuals.  Performing any action toward one individual based on their
<br>
group membership instead of their individual merits is prejudice.  One is
<br>
assuming that the individual has a trait that is actually unlikely.
<br>
<p>Even if blacks commit more crimes than whites per capita, this is no
<br>
justification for stopping a particular black person on suspicion while
<br>
skipping a particular white person who is acting the exact same way.  The
<br>
law should not allow a lower threshold for search and seizure against blacks
<br>
than for whites.  People deserve equal protection under the law.  The group
<br>
statistics do not have any predictive value on any individual.  This is
<br>
basic probability theory.  The chance of flipping coins is 50% heads and 50%
<br>
tails, but does not predict the outcome of any particular coin flip.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Is there any good reason to split hairs with these terms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; except to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to practice prejudice and discrimination while claiming not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be racist?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A little jab with an argument through intimidation there? I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biting. My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire to split hairs on this is I think it is required to sort out this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem where the term racism is used for everything from describing Mark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Furman to describing a cheeseburger.
</em><br>
<p>OK, fair enough.  Let me explain my understanding of the definitions, and
<br>
why they cannot be split apart.
<br>
<p>- Racism is a belief system that non-physical attributes derive from race.
<br>
- Prejudice is pre-judging an individual before evaluating their individual
<br>
merits.
<br>
- Racial Prejudice is prejudice based on an individual's membership in a
<br>
racial group.
<br>
- Discrimination is making choices between different options.
<br>
- Racial Discrimination is making choices between different options based on
<br>
race.
<br>
<p>I don't see how someone can racially pre-judge someone without having the
<br>
belief system of racism.  I don't see how someone can racially discriminate
<br>
against someone without having the belief system of racism.  These terms are
<br>
inextricably intertwined thusly:
<br>
<p>Step 1:  Racism - holding certain beliefs about races
<br>
Step 2:  Racial Prejudice - applying those beliefs to individuals based on
<br>
step 1
<br>
Step 3:  Racial Discrimination - taking actions against those individuals
<br>
based on step 2
<br>
<p>As I understand these terms, I don't see how someone could discriminate
<br>
without pre-judging first.  I don't see how someone could pre-judge without
<br>
having pre-existing beliefs first.  I could see someone admitting that they
<br>
were racist, but tried not to act on it.  I don't see how someone can claim
<br>
to be prejudiced or discriminatory while also claiming not to be racist.
