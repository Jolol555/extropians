<p>
The man with the highest IQ ever may have been a fellow by name of
<br>
William James Sidis (1898-1944). Sidis's IQ can only be approximately
<br>
known even though he took many IQ tests, the tests were just not up to
<br>
the task, he was off the charts. Abraham Sterling, director of New York
<br>
City's Aptitude Testing Institute said &quot; he easily had an IQ between 250
<br>
and 300, I have never heard of anybody with such an IQ. I would say
<br>
that he was the most prodigious intellect of our entire generation&quot;.
<br>
<p>So what did this &quot;prodigious intellect&quot; accomplish in his 46 years?
<br>
He wrote a book about streetcar transfers, that's about it.
<br>
It seems high IQ and genius are not quite synonymous.
