<em>&gt; &gt;The problem is that science (specifically sociobiology) continues to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I *think* Mike meant theorists who deny that there are objective moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properties. Sociobiology does no such thing. At the most, it shows that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a &quot;human nature&quot; in the sense that there is a tendency for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different kinds of human beings (eg sexes, ages) to act in certain ways in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain environments, and that these tendencies are genetically hard-wired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into us by the experience of our ancestors in the evolutionary environments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is an interesting datum, but it goes nowhere near to establishing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence of objective moral properties. Indeed, there are respectable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments that it actually reinforces subjectivist theories of ethics: moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules are just subjective to our evolutionary coding.
</em><br>
<p>Only if they ignore things like Bayesian theory, which can demonstrate
<br>
in a social context that when individuals act outwardly altruistic for
<br>
personal reasons, more individuals in the system benefit most than when
<br>
individuals do not act altruistically. One reason the subjectivists hate
<br>
Bayesian theory is that it demonstrates the similarity between the free
<br>
market and the social milieu so well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike would also be familiar the idea that we have an incentive to *change*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our inherited evolutionary coding because it gives us dispositions that may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have increased our inclusive fitness in the evolutionary environment but are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguably detrimental to our well-being in modern, high-technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environments. Evolution, of course, does not care about an organism's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well-being but only about its inclusive fitness.
</em><br>
<p>Biological evolution, you mean. One should not fall into the trap of
<br>
simply treating humanity as a species driven only by biological
<br>
evolution in a genetic framework. Since technology has been a part of
<br>
our species since the beginning, it is important to also consider how
<br>
technology and other forms of information outside of the genetic milieu.
<br>
This is where other objective facts of reality come into play: how the
<br>
earth formed and deposited resources at points around its surface, how
<br>
the climate has evolved, and how other species have developed.
<br>
<p>The problem that subjectivists have is much like the problems that
<br>
theists have with accepting the idea that the human mind is anything but
<br>
an organic computer running a program: the system they observe is too
<br>
complex for them to comprehend the objective basis for its operation in
<br>
its entirety, and end up grasping at tiny scraps of rather flighty and
<br>
evanescent pieces of the puzzle.
<br>
<p>Just because a jig saw puzzle unsolved is a pile of pieces does not mean
<br>
that every piece does not have its objective place in the overall
<br>
design.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Peter Singer has a very good book on the relationship between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sociobiological claims and ethics. IIRC correctly its title is something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like _The Expanding Circle_. He's come back to this issue a lot in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recent work.
</em><br>
<p>I'll have to read that. I suggest reading things like Jared Diamond's
<br>
&quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;, which presents a rather persuasive argument
<br>
for an objective basis for the preeminence of western concepts.
