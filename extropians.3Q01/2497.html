I think Chris's analysis is very accurate, but there are a couple of
<br>
places I would differ slightly:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I found Cato's Policy Analysis on &quot;California's Electricity Crisis&quot; [1] to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be quite informative and very valuable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The report explains that the retail price controls mean that consumers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were more price insensitive than the politicians believed.  In the short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term, consumers can't change the kinds of appliances they have, and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't hear about prices until the end of the month, so the argument says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they can't react to changing prices.  The promised price reductions for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumers who reduce their use by 20% or more, combined with the high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices charged recently have resulted in more consumers reaching the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; target than anyone expected.  Consumers react to prices after all!  :-)
</em><br>
<p>Right, but the point is, the prices faced by consumers did not actually
<br>
change until a couple of months ago (with the exception of San Diego
<br>
Gas and Electric customers; see below).  It does not make sense to
<br>
discuss price elasticity or sensitivity of consumers in a situation where
<br>
their prices do not change.  Wholesale prices were climbing through the
<br>
roof but retail prices were constant.  Do we really want to say that
<br>
consumers were unexpectedly price insensitive to wholesale prices, when
<br>
their retail prices were not changing?  The concept of price sensitivity
<br>
should be reserved for the case where people are reacting to changes in
<br>
the prices they pay, not to changes in the prices someone else pays.
<br>
<p>The 20% rebate is an interesting lesson in price structure, too.
<br>
People love to get a discount and &quot;win&quot; something.  We've been going
<br>
around the house turning out lights at night and came in with a 28%
<br>
savings over last year.  The rebate was only about $30, not really all
<br>
that much compared to the total household budget, but it still feels
<br>
like we've accomplished something.  Having a concrete goal makes it a lot
<br>
easier to hit.  I understand that while they expected something like 10%
<br>
of homes to qualify, it's been more like 30%.
<br>
<p>I think the lesson of the San Diego customers is also instructive.
<br>
SDG&amp;E managed to pay off their stranded costs, a technicality in the
<br>
deregulation bill, which allowed them to pass on their higher costs to
<br>
customers starting more than a year ago.  When wholesale prices shot
<br>
through the roof, so did retail prices in San Diego.  SDG&amp;E customers
<br>
saw their electricity rates skyrocket, doubling or tripling in some cases
<br>
[2].  This should be an ideal test case for those who identify the price
<br>
caps as the root problem in the California debacle.
<br>
<p>What happened?  Customers reduced their consumption, yes, but that was
<br>
not the principle effect.  In fact, they essentially went on strike.
<br>
They refused to pay.  They got legislation passed to roll back the rates.
<br>
They took the law into their own hands [3].
<br>
<p>I strongly believe that this is exactly what would have happened
<br>
statewide had we had a truly deregulated electricity market last year.
<br>
Those who claim that the only problem with the deregulation problem
<br>
was its incomplete nature need to recognize and understand the lesson
<br>
of San Diego.  Historically, people do not tolerate the discipline of
<br>
the free market in cases of extreme shortage of crucial commodities,
<br>
whether it is clean water after a hurricane, gasoline after the OPEC
<br>
embargo, or electrical power this past year.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addition, prices of natural gas rose nationally, and there were problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with some of the natural gas pipelines coming into the state, reducing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access to supplies of natural gas, just when it was needed to replace the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missing hydro.
</em><br>
<p>I think that the report downplays the charges of price manipulation in
<br>
California natural gas.  I don't have the details but there was apparently
<br>
a situation with the pipeline where we had a near-monopoly for some weeks,
<br>
and during that time California prices were much higher than elsewhere.
<br>
Once this hit the media and people started paying attention, California
<br>
natural gas prices plummeted.
<br>
<p>The rise in cost of natural gas did play a big part in raising electricity
<br>
prices, but it may have been as much an example of market manipulation
<br>
as what the electricity producers are accused of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If consumers had been price-sensitive, the huge rises in marginal costs 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have led to marginal reductions in demand.  Instead, the utilities 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the ISO reacted as if filling the demand was worth any price, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course kept demand steady, and drove prices ever higher.
</em><br>
<p>Again, consumer prices did not change.  Lack of price sensitivity is not
<br>
the phrase I would choose to explain the fact that demand was constant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The one factor (rising prices) that would normally have allowed demand to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; react to supply prices was missing, and that allowed prices to go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sky-high.  The most important factor in fixing the problem is to remove 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the price caps.  Moving some customers to real-time prices would help the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation.
</em><br>
<p>Real-time pricing is an interesting option.  I was reading some articles
<br>
at www.homepower.com where people have put up solar panels and sell their
<br>
electricity to the state during the day, getting high prices, and then
<br>
draw electricity at night when the price is low.  Granted, it is heavily
<br>
subsidized at this point, but you can get pretty good payback times.
<br>
One of the hurdles is the shortage of the real-time meters which are
<br>
necessary for this to work.
<br>
<p>Most consumers can easily shift much of their electricity consumption
<br>
to the night, so they would be the beneficiaries of realtime metering.
<br>
Small businesses would probably be hurt as their hours are relatively
<br>
fixed.  So politically it will probably be hard to expand the program.
