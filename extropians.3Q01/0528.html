Postal Tax on E-mail Hoax
<br>
Summary:
<br>
An e-mail is circulating throughout the Internet stating &quot;Congressman Schnell&quot;
<br>
has introduced &quot;Bill 602P&quot; allowing the U.S. Postal Service to levy a 5 cent
<br>
tax on e-mail. This e-mail rumor is completely false. In a press statement the
<br>
U.S. Postal Service explains, &quot;A completely false rumor concerning the U.S.
<br>
Postal Service is being circulated on Internet e-mail. As a matter of fact,
<br>
the Postal Service has learned that a similar hoax occurred recently in Canada
<br>
concerning Canada Post.&quot; Similar postal tax e-mails may cite an editorial
<br>
appearing in the March 6, 1999, issue of The Washingtonian, this too is a
<br>
hoax.
<br>

Subject: Federal Bill 602p
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does anyone know about this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Under proposed legislation, the US Postal Service will be attempting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bill  E-mail users out of &quot;alternative postage fees&quot;.  Bill 602P will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permit the Federal Government to charge a 5-cent surcharge  on  every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e-mail delivered, by billing Internet Service Providers at source.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumer would then be billed in turn by the ISP.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Washington DC lawyer Richard Stepp is working without pay to prevent this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legislation from becoming law. The US Postal Service is claiming lost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revenue, due to the proliferation of E-mail, is costing nearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $230,000,000  in revenue per year. You may have noticed their recent ad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; campaign:  &quot;There is  nothing like a letter.&quot;  Since the average person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; received about 10 pieces of E-mail per day in  1998,  the cost of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; typical individual would be an additional 50 cents a day  - or  over $180
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per year - above and beyond their regular Internet costs.  Note that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be money paid directly to the US Postal Service for a  service they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not even provide.  The whole point of the Internet is democracy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-interference. You  are  already paying an exorbitant price for snail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mail because of bureaucratic  inefficiency. It currently takes up to 6 days
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a letter to be  delivered  from coast to coast. If the US Postal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Service is  allowed to tinker with E-mail, it will mark the end of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;free&quot;  Internet in  the United States.  Congressional representative, Tony
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Schnell (R) has even suggested a  &quot;$20-$40  per month surcharge on all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Internet service&quot; above and beyond the  governments  proposed E-mail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charges. Note that most of the major newspapers have  ignored  the story
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the only exception being the Washingtonian which called the  idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; E-mail surcharge &quot;a useful concept who's time has come&quot; (March 6th, 1999
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Editorial). Do not sit by and watch your freedom erode away!  Send this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; E-mail to EVERYONE on your list, and tell all your friends and  relatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to write their congressional representative and say &quot;NO&quot; to  Bill  602P.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It will only take a few moments of your time and could very well be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instrumental in killing a bill we do not want.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks,
</em><br>
