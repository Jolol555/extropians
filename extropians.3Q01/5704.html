<em>&gt; &gt;Dr. Rucker blew my mind with his research into artificial life, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;all the other cool stuff he is in to.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Ja, in fact I didn't even know he *was* Dr. Rucker until we got up
<br>
there.  Damien didn't mention it as I recall, he merely spoke as an
<br>
old friend and associate.  Definitely counter culture type.  I became
<br>
steady more in awe as the evening progressed.  Completely
<br>
unpretentious, waaaay smart.  I wanna be like him when I grow up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, He has a wild imagination, and it's indeed very cool to talk to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him. Is he working on any new books?
</em><br>
<p>In fact he is.  He gave me copies of his latest two.  He was working
<br>
on one when we were up there a year and a half ago, so good
<br>
chance it is currently in print.  Perhaps Damien knows.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;(Rucker is a math/comp sci professor at San Jose State U.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yup. He taught my SJSU computer graphics course (1987). Amara
</em><br>
<p>Amara, like you, Rudy Rucker is a person with many talents.
