<em>&gt;From: &quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20TERRORISM:%20Is%20genocide%20the%20logical%20solution?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200109162305.f8GN52m24827@pheidippides.md.chalmers.se&gt;">bradbury@aeiveos.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I know that by raising this issue, I am going to take a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amount of flak.  But that is the purpose of the Extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;list -- to engage in rational discussion of ideas -- even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if those ideas may seem repulsive at first.
</em><br>
<p>To be honest, right now you just scared the hell out of me so much
<br>
as to make my finding out any proper flak impossible. Are you
<br>
serious or did I wake up in a parallel universe today, like
<br>
in one of those bad superhero comic books?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a rational position, *if* the case can be made that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Afgani position &amp; politics is likely to result in the diversion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of resources and delay the development of the technologies we anticipate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;developing by more than 6 months, then a plan of genocide to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bury the country in rubble seems justified.
</em><br>
<p>I pressume you would next go for Iraq, then, since the costs of
<br>
bombing Saddam repeatedly are adding to the delay. Then, Serbia I would
<br>
expect, since all that peacekeeping is expensive as hell. Naturally
<br>
you will go then through some African countries that currently take
<br>
away too much money in food/health UN assistance. And the big debtor
<br>
countries like mine, so you can be spared the tons of risky loans our
<br>
economic reconstruction will take.
<br>
<p>Please clarify if you have any plans to try and make your case into public
<br>
policy, or if this is just a theoretical exercise in cost reductions. I'd
<br>
like to buy my survival gear and supplies in time, you know.
<br>
<p>It will take me a long time to actually come to grips with the fact
<br>
I'm reading this kind of thing in a list like this one, regardless of
<br>
your answer/clarification.
<br>
<p>Carlos
