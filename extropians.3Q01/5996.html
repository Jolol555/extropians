<p>
<em> &gt; Let me go further: the FASTEST way to build public support for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; draconian legislation of this type in the UK would be to somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; link DRM circumvention tools to handguns in the public mind.
</em><br>
<p>I agree completely.
<br>
<p>We should keep in mind: the extreme position of the politicians
<br>
against cloning has mainly one reason: a book called &quot;Brave New World&quot;.
<br>
No politician can afford to be associatad with a negative utopia. More
<br>
concretely: no politican can afford to be associated with something
<br>
which is FEARED. It does not matter whether it is well found or not.
<br>
<p>Therefore, I think the best way to get support against this legislation
<br>
associate it with Orwells 1984. Altough I don't like the book itself,
<br>
it has certain symbolic strength and it is widely known.
<br>
It is embarassing, but the public does not care about laws, until it is
<br>
not shocked. Distributing fear is the most elementary manipulation which
<br>
is adopted by every politician quite early, even by the most tolerant and
<br>
libertarians ones. I dislike this method, but if we want to communicate
<br>
efficiently, we need it. At least our fears are really honest and
<br>
realist.
<br>
<p>Remember the power of fear: it led to gun control and the drug war.
<br>
<p>Let us look it as a game: who generates most fear in public against the
<br>
other side, wins.
<br>
<p>Our chances are not bad: the supporters of this copyright enforcement
<br>
legislations don't have any logical way to generate enough fear to
<br>
collect public support for their laws. The only thing they can hope for is
<br>
either pushing through the laws unrecognized or generating the
<br>
fears emotionally. If we connect computer hacking and technology with drugs
<br>
and guns. Then they'll get it for free.
<br>
<p>I am completely sure that this menace can not be fought by technical means
<br>
such as secure distributed networks and underground hacking. Our intentions 
<br>
are not to copy illegal stuff and live in fear, but work and develop freely,
<br>
accelerate progress and be accepted. These goals are not to be achieved by 
<br>
more advanced technology, only by politics.
