</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>But are you not making the claim here that this is objective truth?  You are
<br>
making claims about knowledge that are either true or false.  If they are
<br>
true, how can you know it, since you are conditioned by the same things.
<br>
(Knowledge is knowledge -- even knowledge about other knowledge.)  Thus,
<br>
they're would be refuted.  If they are false, then ditto.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Consider the new knowledge being formed today. How arbitrary it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tomorrow many of these premises shall be the realism people debate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then. But is it real today?
</em><br>
<p>And also for this statement.  Surely, some specific item or theory might
<br>
change -- as happened in the past.  However, how do you know about such
<br>
changes?  If you claim they are merely conditioned by your context without
<br>
regard to their veracity, then we can simply reject them as your fancies.
<br>
If, however, you claim to have knowledge here, then there must be some
<br>
contact with reality.
<br>
<p>This by no means solves all epistemological problems, but it clears the path
<br>
to better understanding.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
