<em>&gt; &gt;Try cramming a heap of US citizens into a tiny and deprived space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;with appalling restrictions upon their normal movement, with most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of what you would consider essential rights taken away by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;faceless, brutal soldiers and see if those US citizens would be

<em>&gt; &gt;peaceful. *Of course* some of the  Palestinians have gone for the

<em>&gt; &gt;violent solution, what else could be expected? Many normally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;enlightened members of this list have been braying for incredible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and truly terrifying violent solutions lately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You have a double standard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's perfectly understandable to you that the Palestinians use
</em><br>
<em>&gt;violence and terrorism to try and achieve their aims, but those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have to use violence to defend themselves are the bad guys
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm... I probably should have made myself clearer. I figured my 
<br>
anti-senseless-violence stance would have shown where I was coming from. I 
<br>
don't excuse the violence of Palestinian extremists. Such violence is 
<br>
counterproductive and a big mistake. It enables the US and Israel to 
<br>
(somehow) discount these people and say that they're not serious about peace.
<br>
<p>I certainly wasn't defending violence. I did say that it was understandable 
<br>
if you consider the brutish impositions upon them. It would take incredible 
<br>
self control to avoid violence in such a situation. I tried to illustrate 
<br>
this by imagining a situation where US citizens were confined in such an 
<br>
inhumane manner. Wow! Can you see how the sparks would fly? There would be 
<br>
*massive* violence.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;I'll ignore the braying remark for now, next time it's sig file
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time.
</em><br>
<p>OK. Sorry. It was a bit low... I just get sooo sick of the automatic &quot;we 
<br>
can kill anybody we suspect of hurting us, but other people are to be 
<br>
despised for retaliating against brutality&quot; stuff.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;The Palestinians are just people. They are the same as the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;on the other side of the border. When you forget that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;people then you can justify atrocities... exactly the same way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;those fools who rode the airplanes into the WTC did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I see them as people, people who won't listen to reason, people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think they can get away with using terrorism for political aims.
</em><br>
<p>No. There are some who do indulge in terrorism, and that can never be 
<br>
excused. But you can't blame all the other men, women and children for the 
<br>
sins of a few. That is as bad as the blind fools who thought that killing 
<br>
all those people in the WTC was justified because they were the American 
<br>
people who caused them their grief.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;The image of them cheering is hard to get rid of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Which is probably why the clip was played over and over again...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;or maybe I am wording that wrongly. I should probably say that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;viewers were played by those that screened the tape of those kids.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It was guaranteed to get a nasty reaction. It almost certainly was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;not representative. So, why do you think they showed it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Actually I only saw it once, but that was enough. It was being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;broadcast by international media and was picked up here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The theatrics of the Palestinians happened after we know they saw
</em><br>
<em>&gt;broadcasts of American reaction to the dancing in the street bit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Which is why it carries little weight here.
</em><br>
<p>You &quot;know&quot; it? Why do you know it?
<br>
Did you read the post from the guy who says it was footage shot in 1991?
<br>
<p>You have to be careful of the news media. They have incredible power and 
<br>
are often careless, inflammatory, even slanderous. We have had for a long 
<br>
time in Oz a program which alerts viewers to wrongful, misleading, and lazy 
<br>
reporting. It happens way more often than you would like to think.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
