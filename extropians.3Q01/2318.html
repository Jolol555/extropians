<em>&gt;With the Singularity so close, why would you tell someone to save
</em><br>
<em>&gt;money, work hard (even when they don't feel like it), and educate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves (even when they don't want to)?  I'll bet that you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reasons!  But they can retort &quot;now there is a GMI---so I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*have* to do any of those things, right?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Why would anyone be satisfied with whatever it is that the GMI guarantees?
<br>
It's unlikely that it would guarantee them enough wealth to upload or to
<br>
augment their minds or to migrate to an asteroid that is safe from gray goo.
<br>
It might not even guarantee them enough to afford cryonics. It's easy to
<br>
imagine that in a few years a new cryopreservation method will be offered
<br>
at higher than current prices which has been shown to work on small animals.
<br>
I could probably come up with many more possibilities along these lines.
<br>
&nbsp;I can easily imagine that the importance of being one of first to upload or
<br>
to colonize a new solar system exceeds any historical benefits that have
<br>
resulted from wealth, and that people who don't augment their minds will
<br>
become anachronisms.
<br>
&nbsp;These examples also show why extremely few of the people who advocate
<br>
a GMI will be satisfied with just guaranteeing that nobody starves, and
<br>
why your hope that the singularity will make a GMI easier to afford seems
<br>
a bit utopian. There has never been any threshold of wealth beyond which
<br>
a person's life expectancy doesn't appear to increase with further wealth,
<br>
and it isn't obvious how the singularity will change this. The sympathies
<br>
for the poor that cause people to want a GMI will cause them to keep
<br>
increasing the number of needs that it ought to cover until it reaches
<br>
whatever limits taxpayers will tolerate.
