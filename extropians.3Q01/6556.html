<p>As long as we keep this discussion to physics rather than politics, I
<br>
suppose this is reasonable, but at the first sign of acrimony I suggest
<br>
we take it to exi-freedom.
<br>
<p>That said, I shudder at the mishmash of units- furlongs per fortnight,
<br>
anyone? Converting to slug-foot-second units, I get
<br>
<p>Mass = 240gr / 7000 gr/lbm =  .034 lbm = 1.06e-3 slug
<br>
V = 1348 ft/s
<br>
<p>MV^2/2 = 967 ft-lb   &lt;note that lb is a unit of force, not mass
<br>
<p>This is an energy, a measure of how much work the projectile can do. 
<br>
This relates directly to wound damage, but does NOT say how much
<br>
velocity change can be produced by an impact.  For that we need
<br>
momentum:
<br>
<p>MV = 1.44 slug-ft/s = 46.2 lbm-ft/s  (after multiplying by that pesky 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;factor of g for pounds mass)
<br>
<p>Momentum is conserved, M1*V1 + M2*V2 = (M1 + M2)*V3
<br>
<p>where object 1 is the bullet, object 2 is the target.
<br>
<p>Since M2&gt;&gt;M1 and V2=0, this simplifies to
<br>
<p>M1*V1 = M2*V3
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so
<br>
<p>V3 = M1*V1/M2
<br>
<p>For our hypothetical 157 lbm target, the velocity is
<br>
<p>V3 = 46.2/157 = .3 ft/s, hardly enough to make an adult stagger.  If
<br>
you've seen live fire tests of body armor, you'll note that the person
<br>
being shot hardly moves with the impact... about as much as the shooter
<br>
did.
<br>
<p>Projectile weapons do their damage via energy deposited in the target,
<br>
not momentum- since the momentum imparted to the gun is the same
<br>
magnitude as that sent downrange in the bullet, although of opposite
<br>
sign.  This relates to the problem of rockets, in that to put a lot of
<br>
momentum into the exhaust gases, they must go very fast- which requires
<br>
tremendous energy.  The gases from the engines I work with travel far
<br>
far faster than any bullet, typically 7000 ft/s or more.
