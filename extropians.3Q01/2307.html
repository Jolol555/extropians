<p><em>&gt;... and so I thought J.R. Molloy's observation was prescient (he caught the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;childrearing is tough work (a point on which Natasha and Samantha weighed
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To which Natasha retorted:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; It makes sense to me that in a partnership where both parties want a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; family, that both parties work and pay equally.  Producing and raising a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; child is said to be one of the toughest jobs there is.
</em><br>
<p>Parties to the partnership work and pay equally according to the amount of
<br>
contribution she or he invests. I didn't say where they work.  This, of
<br>
course, is not just doing a day job, or night job.  The $ equally is
<br>
incorrect, it should be % of $ earned.  This can be estimated for the
<br>
&quot;house manager&quot; at the rate of quality and expertise in her or his work.
<br>
I'd go for style, organization, cleanliness, uniqueness, ambiance and
<br>
surprise.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And Samantha replied:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Do you think that housewives don't work?   Ha!  It is a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; better today but in most two wage-earner families I know of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; woman comes home from the office and does most of the cooking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cleaning and dealing with the children still on top of her
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; workday at the office.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know who or what Samantha was replying to.  It doesn't seem to
<br>
follow my line of thinking, or I wasn't clear.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(Scenario 1), Natasha  is talking about both parties working and paying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equally, and childrearing is always tough (Scenario 2), and Samantha seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be saying whether housewives work outside the home, inside the home, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;both, it's all work, and childrearing is always tough (Scenario 3).
</em><br>
<p>I'm talking about parties contributing equally according to his investment
<br>
of time and energy into the partnership unit.  This doesn't mean Jim goes
<br>
to work from 9 - 5, 5 days a week and Sam does the same time equally.  It
<br>
means Jim cleans, cooks, gardens and also is a chief at a local restaurant
<br>
while Sam is a programmer and also invests much time planning their
<br>
vacations and ways to improve their lives.  When they adopt a child, Jim
<br>
and Sam rework their schedules so that they provide the love and
<br>
nourishment to the child by and educate the child, each their his unique
<br>
skills and knowledge.  The &quot;equal&quot; does not mean the $ amount of  each
<br>
paycheck and number hours of work cut down the middle, but the level of
<br>
investment of time, energy, intelligence and creativity.  Herein, I also
<br>
think that equally pertains to percentage of income.  If Jim makes $70,000
<br>
and Sam makes $48,000, it would be an equal percentage, not an equal dollar
<br>
amount of their income to the partnership.
