<em>&gt; &gt;   Insofar as education has become more &quot;non-discriminatory&quot; (the

<em>&gt; Are you saying that public schools should revert back to how they were

</em><br>
<p>Well, considering how much the left accepts the means justifying the
<br>
ends if it is their ends being served, you may notice that literacy
<br>
among African Americans was much higher prior to Brown v. Board of
<br>
Education than it is today....
