<em>&gt; `Superbugs', so-called, are not some new and unheralded kind of omnipotent

</em><br>
<em>&gt; background
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ecological mix does somehow skew the norm of reaction for viri.)
</em><br>
<p>Not quite.  There were originally many variants of each particular bacteria
<br>
and its resulting disease.  All these variants are competing in the
<br>
environment and in the people they infect.  This means that 99% of the
<br>
bacteria in a diseased person could be wiped out with antibiotics.  99% of
<br>
the cases of that disease in a human is minor and curable.  99% of time
<br>
there is no problem.  Superbugs were rarely ever seen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What they are is, by definition, *bacteria resistant to a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antibiotic*, or perhaps a family of similar antibiotics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That means that their evolution, at worst, has reverted the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balance of play
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the way it was originally.
</em><br>
<p>Not quite.  Just as jackrabbits are taking over Australia due to a lack or
<br>
predators, and fire-ants are taking over Florida due to the killing of other
<br>
ants, antibiotics wipe out the wimpy bacteria and leave only the super
<br>
bacteria.  Without competition, the super bacteria fill the entire niche
<br>
where the wimpy bacteria used to be.  Remember that it is the same kind of
<br>
bacteria, so it fits right into the gap left by its wimpy versions.
<br>
<p>Now, 99% of the bacteria in a disease person remains unaffected by
<br>
treatment.  Now, 99% of the cases of this particular disease are incurable.
<br>
99% of the time there is nothing we can do to stop the disease.  Even before
<br>
antibiotics, people could survive many illnesses, because the immune system
<br>
could overcome it.  The superbugs are the strong unstoppable kind, so the
<br>
immune system cannot overcome it.  After antibiotics, the superbug becomes
<br>
the prevalent form of that particular infections.  In such a case, we have
<br>
mutated a rarely-fatal disease into an often-fatal disease that spreads the
<br>
same way and fills the same environmental niche as the original.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *Except* that, in the meantime, monocultural agribiz has reduced the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic diversity of crops, making widespread variants especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vulnerable to the rebound diseases. That's not the fault of antibiotics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *per se*, though. It might be a very good reason to worry about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excessively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; centralized and massively advertised corporate food production.
</em><br>
<p>This is a real concern with crops that are geared to a particular pesticide.
<br>
After literally a couple of years of use, only pests that are resistant to
<br>
the pesticide will remain in the area.  Even the crop manufacturers predict
<br>
that their crops are only going to be viable for a decade or less, and that
<br>
they are trying to develop new ones before the old ones become obsolete.
<br>
They also instruct farmers not to cover their entire field with the
<br>
pesticide to avoid developing super-pests.  Unfortunately, they are already
<br>
seeing most farmers ignore this warning.  Like the prisoner's dilemma, each
<br>
farmer things they can get more and leave the precautions to other farmers,
<br>
but everybody loses if everybody gets greedy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My feeling is that one needs to be very careful in describing the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem(s), and allocating blame. As far as I can see, *nobody* has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harmed by applying antibiotics to ill humans. I and many others are now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alive because of them. If we now face, at worst, reversion to a condition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where resistant bacterial diseases roam the world unchecked, that's very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sad--not because of the brief, blessed epoch of cheap, effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antibiotics, but because it's at an end.
</em><br>
<p>The problems with developing super bacteria have been known for decades.
<br>
Most medical personnel didn't listen, because each individual case appears
<br>
more important than the big picture.  The outbreak of unstoppable bugs in
<br>
hospitals and stronger epidemics is killing people.  People are dying due to
<br>
widespread overuse of antibiotics.  I don't think more have been killed than
<br>
saved yet, but it is a vicious cycle that we need to break before things get
<br>
worse than the original state.  It may be claimed that there is blame and
<br>
that people are being killed by this phenomenon.  We should not be too
<br>
flippant in dismissing these claims.  They do have some historical truth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, I doubt that it *is* at an end, because soon our medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be so far advanced by genomics, proteomics etc that we'll outdo even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the vast genetic algorithm factories of the natural world (i.e., our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bodies and those of our livestock, where the bugs breed and mutate).
</em><br>
<p>Hopefully.  However it is always a risky position to argue for ignoring a
<br>
known problem based on the hope that a solution will appear in the future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If that's true, resistance will be, for the superbugs, futile. And even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's not true, the supposed `superbugs' provide no evidence at all that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have entered a new era of unprecedented malignancy--Gaia `fighting back',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as some dopes like to think of it. It's just, at worst, a return to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ecological business as usual.
</em><br>
<p>There is no reason to lump the super-bugs in with mystical Gaia theories.
<br>
Any bacteriologist will tell you that this phenomenon is real and is a
<br>
direct threat to public health.  It is naive to dismiss this as an unfounded
<br>
belief or to ignore it on the hopes that someone else will clean up our
<br>
mess.
