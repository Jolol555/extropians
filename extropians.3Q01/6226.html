I dont think anyone is saying that the tens of thousands of doomed people
<br>
who had to get up and work thier crappy jobs like everyone else in the world
<br>
deserved to be burned, suffocated, or crushed to death at the WTC, or the
<br>
people on the airplanes going home to see loved ones or working thier crappy
<br>
jobs to feed thier families  deserved to be slashed, crushed, burned, or
<br>
killed in general.  No one is saying that these people deserved to die.  If
<br>
we want to combat terrorism, there is no way you can lock down the state
<br>
enough to ever make it safe.  No amount of Xray machines, face scanners, ID
<br>
cards, barcodes of foreheads, or DNA tags will ever make it completely safe.
<br>
You have to remove the incentive people have to be terrorist.  In this case,
<br>
it is national hatred for the US, this hatred comes from the US policing of
<br>
the entire world.  Bin Ladden specifically said that every US citizen is a
<br>
valid military target in response to the US's military involvement in
<br>
palestine.  The US was not attacked because 'it was a beacon of freedom' as
<br>
BUsh said so melodramatically, it was attacked because we have been doing
<br>
things in other peoples countries to piss them off.  Stop pissing these
<br>
other countries off (that is, remove the military presence which is a direct
<br>
represnetation of the US as a country) and no longer does anyone breed
<br>
hatred of the US and want to kill every working US citizen.  Has Sweden ever
<br>
been terrorist attacked?  The only way to get rid of terrorism is to remove
<br>
the incentive people have to commit it.
