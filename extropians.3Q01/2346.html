<p>
Here is a question that has bugged me off and on for years.
<br>
<p>What ways of handling property rights and especially land rights
<br>
seem most reasonable for people who value individual liberty
<br>
and the well being of people in general?
<br>
<p>I like the idea that something becomes yours when it is laying
<br>
around and you mix your labor with it or otherwise consistently
<br>
make it a part of your possessions.  Once something becomes
<br>
yours it stays yours until you abandon it or transfer it in some
<br>
way.  Contracts can modify this as in work for hire, etc.
<br>
<p>This works fairly well for small items and stuff that involves
<br>
a lot of labor.  But what about large tracts of land, mineral
<br>
rights, etc.  If a small bit of land lays unclaimed and you claim
<br>
it, work it, build a home on it etc. it makes sense to me that
<br>
it becomes yours and stays yours as long as you do not forfeit
<br>
it by abusing your neighbors in some way.
<br>
<p>I don't see why people get to claim large amounts of land unless
<br>
they do something with it which gets most people in the area to
<br>
decide not to contest their claim.  Obviously this can be done
<br>
with military force but that only last as long as the force lasts.
<br>
Contracts and agreements can last longer because most everyone
<br>
needs a good reputation to thrive in this world.
<br>
<p>I don't want to speculate on this to much because it may have
<br>
been worked out well by others but I would like to have some
<br>
clear conception in my mind.  I think this makes for an important
<br>
political issue.  Whose land rights do I see as valid and what sort
<br>
of land rights ideas do I want to propagate.
<br>
<p>If governments can legitimately claim land rights they have a right
<br>
to do a lot of other things too.  If the U.S.A. corporation or the
<br>
California corporation owns the lands they claim, they may be 
<br>
entitled to charge fees, percentages, etc. for passing through their 
<br>
land.  I doubt they do because something does not seem right
<br>
but I want to have a better understanding of these issues.
<br>
<p>Certainly, fees for passing through, living on land when you have
<br>
no other reasonable options, etc., work better if they are reasonable,
<br>
otherwise the people being billed have no reason to buy into
<br>
the system.  People must have an opportunity, a pathway to
<br>
leading a good life or they will reasonably rebel.  But if one has
<br>
the means and other people have legitimate property rights it
<br>
makes sense to pay the fees or move on.
<br>
<p>There may be no general solutions but only rules of thumb and
<br>
traditions people buy into.  It may be more a matter of working
<br>
out something everyone with power can live with.
<br>
<p>I can't expect that anything which violates and individual's survival
<br>
or well being, will be accepted by that individual.  Neither can I expect
<br>
everyone or anyone to structure things for the benefit of particular
<br>
individuals or groups.  The ideal system gets everyone who is in
<br>
a position to contest it meaningfully to buy in.  Some people may
<br>
not buy it at first but a good system will be one that sane people 
<br>
buy into given time.  
<br>
<p>I suppose land rights can also be conceived as space rights or
<br>
more accurately spatial relationships rights.  Some segment of
<br>
space is yours.  The space moves or rather you are always moving
<br>
but you move in relationship to everything (or almost everything
<br>
else) which is also moving.  So how does one reasonably structure
<br>
rights to a particular volume of matter moving through space.  Land
<br>
on Earth moves through space in relationship to other land on earth
<br>
most of the time.
<br>
<p>So, there are rights to matter/energy, and rights to move things on
<br>
vectors.  Another way to think of it is, rights to occupy a volume 
<br>
moving through space.  The matter may be expanding along with 
<br>
most other matter associated with it.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure the science of it is relevant but it may help to think
<br>
of things more physically.  What I am after is political understanding
<br>
to guide ethics and persuade people.
<br>
<p>I suspect groups of people have seldom work these things out
<br>
formally.  Perhaps rules have evolved as part of common law.
<br>
More likely people just go and do what they think will work
<br>
for them or what they think they can get away with.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I'm open to discussion or suggestions for good reading
<br>
material.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Will
