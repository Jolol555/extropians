|You already have been, and it don't hurt so bad, does it?  You are a number 
<br>
|(actually several of them: driver's license, SSN, health insurance policy 
<br>
|number).  In fact every business with whom you have any sort of account 
<br>
|(utilities, credit cards, mortgage, student loans) has numbered you, indexed 
<br>
|you and most likely cross-referenced you with other databases in which you 
<br>
|are little more than a number.
<br>
<p>In Sweden, every person has a personal number (originally the SSN), used by
<br>
the government to control everything about a registered person. And it hurts
<br>
in case one does not do something about it.
<br>
<p>I have, since I read John Brunner's &quot;The Shockwave Rider&quot; (ISBN 0-345-32431-5)
<br>
made sure that my data shadow does not look like me:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;o  avoid giving out name information (fake a new one each time somebody
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asks for a name)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o  avoid giving out address information (and no forwarding addresses)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o  avoid ID cards where possible
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o  avoid buying anything with a identifiable card (cash works nicely)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o  avoid having an account with any business (or have one with a fake name)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o  avoid using bank accounts (safes work nicely)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o  avoid using a personal number (fake one for each use)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o  no mortgages, no loans, minimum number of contracts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o  no known home address (every year the gov't threatens to define me dead)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o  use several cash (mobile) phones and beepers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o  suppress information about birthday and age (or just fake it)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o  encrypt your data storage and conduits
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o  use contra-surveillance techniques
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o  avoid having any known habits, distinguishing features or marks
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o  change your appearance aperiodically
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>|People reflexively say they don't want their personal information available 
<br>
|for public perusal.  The fact of the matter is that given any two of the 
<br>
|following pieces of data about you, any of the others can readily be 
<br>
|obtained if you know where to look and are willing to pay for it: birthdate, 
<br>
|name, address, telephone number, social security number, driver's license 
<br>
|number.
<br>
<p>Yes, they can if you do allow your data shadow to match your real data.
<br>
Why should I fill somebody's data bases with valuable data for free?
<br>
I see no reason to allow it, and lots of reasons to not allow it.
<br>
<p>|Individuals, as much as they hate to believe it, already are about as 
<br>
|transparent as they can be.  The only &quot;persons&quot; who enjoy any semblance of 
<br>
|real privacy anymore are corporate and government institutions.  That is why 
<br>
|transparency will be more of a benefit than a detriment to individuals.  But 
<br>
|I am a patient man.  Eventually the value of transparency will make itself 
<br>
|known and, although I'm not the type to say &quot;I told you so,&quot; you'll know 
<br>
|I'll be thinking it ;)
<br>
<p>Transparency can be defeated by making the &quot;transparent&quot; data invalid, fake,
<br>
outdated, and/or missing.  It also helps to know how the technologies works.
