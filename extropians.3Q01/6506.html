<p>No, it's not. You need to really understand that a switch has been
<br>
flipped here, but its not permanent. Our country, at least, is
<br>
structured to function this way in event of war, and it is structured to
<br>
be flipped back once war has been won. When attacked, our congress is
<br>
supposed to empower the president to act as a temporary limited dictator
<br>
for the duration of conflict, whose authority devolves back to congress
<br>
and the people at the conclusion of that conflict.
<br>
<p>It is true that this has been strained by WWII and the 50 years of Cold
<br>
War following it (and the past decade of terrorism following the Cold
<br>
War), but it can be said that this is the result when a nation refuses
<br>
to proceed to a fully conclusive victory. This is generally because we
<br>
dislike conflict, we dislike dictating to others, and our Presidents,
<br>
contrary to opposition propaganda, generally dislike weilding such
<br>
excessive executive power as much as Cincinnatus did 2300+ years ago.
<br>
<p>We have repeatedly, throughout the 20th century, refused to take
<br>
complete victory in War in so many ways. We've permitted tyrants,
<br>
totalitarian regiemes, and piratical organizations to continue to exist,
<br>
refusing to call up the intestinal fortitude to see things to their
<br>
proper conclusion, to demand the establishment of proper peaceful
<br>
societies in so many places. I shall note that nations like Germany and
<br>
Japan, who we committed to defeat utterly, are now among the most
<br>
peaceful and democratic nations on earth. This is the goal we should
<br>
pursue in every conflict.
<br>
<p>It is our refusal to commit totally to make the world truly 'safe for
<br>
democracy' that has resulted in the present state of things.
<br>
<p>After defeat of Germany and Japan, we refused Patton's recommendation to
<br>
go on against Stalin, and later we held back against MacArthur's wish to
<br>
strike Communist China in the Korean War. In the Gulf War, we held back
<br>
against continuing on to Bagdad to depose Hussein's government and clean
<br>
Iraq out of all WOMD technologies. Just last year, Clinton held back
<br>
against nailing bin Laden when provided with concrete information as to
<br>
the whereabouts of him and his associates.
<br>
<p>We must demand that nations end their support of such covert activities,
<br>
disregarding the laws of war that prohibit actions against civilians,
<br>
that combatants must wear distinguishing uniforms and belong to
<br>
recognisable command structures. Societies which refuse to act according
<br>
to the laws of war must be pounded until they cry uncle and acquiesce to
<br>
our just demands, must accept restructuring of their societies into open
<br>
democratic nations, where educational systems cannot program their
<br>
students with hate, with glory for martyrdom. Everyone must be taught
<br>
true history, not propaganda.
<br>
<p>Just as the Holocaust cannot be denied, the criminal acts of terrorists
<br>
can no longer be glorified, rationalized, excused, worshipped,
<br>
respected, or condoned. Societies which refuse to do so must be shut off
<br>
from the world, and if need be, pounded to dust.
