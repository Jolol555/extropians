<p>
The more complicated issue to me is, what can be reduced to qualifying as the 
<br>
difference, between You and your body? The more Objectivist view is to 
<br>
concede that you are a body. In the case of some evolution uploading to 
<br>
software, we need to go to neuroscientists and have them help us best decided 
<br>
what is, in fact, you? 
<br>
<p>Are you feedback from a neuromuscular system, plus memory?
<br>
<p>Is there any reasonable chance that you are more or less then that?
<br>
<p>Can computer science, anytime soon, absorb the &quot;haptics&quot; of the sensation and 
<br>
memory of the inside of your own mouth? If not, is this something people will 
<br>
need?
<br>
<p>What about hundreds of other minor sensations and habits that will need to be 
<br>
duplicated sufficiently, in order to &quot;fool&quot; the uploaded personality?
<br>
<p>Do neuroscientists yet understand sufficiently what constitutes us as a 
<br>
personality?
<br>
The limbic system, cerebrum, cerebellum, and all its interlocked interactions.
<br>
<p>The complexity to this is daunting so no wonder thinkers seek a Yudkowskian 
<br>
Singularity to be able to accomplish this, rather then the monkey, trying to 
<br>
understand the monkey. Please hand me a banana.

<p>&lt;&lt; I had been supposing that there already were levels of implementation
<br>
&nbsp;(or abstraction) between me and the physical world.  I see my body
<br>
&nbsp;as just a device that allows my actual living to take place;  that's
<br>
&nbsp;why I look forward to an upgrade to distributed hardware.  The 
<br>
&nbsp;material world will be no more abandoned then than it is now:  if
<br>
&nbsp;I have my way, I'll have sensors throughout whatever solar systems
<br>
&nbsp;I live in that keep me posted on the slow-moving physical world.
<br>
&nbsp;If all goes well, then I'll have to pay even less attention to it
<br>
&nbsp;than I do now.
