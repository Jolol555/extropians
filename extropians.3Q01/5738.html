<p><em>&gt;From current vs past datapoints I've noticed that the cypherpunk community

anonymous and authenticated realtime communication. This is not good news

Jabber will also have crypto capability one day, purportedly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But it has also &quot;tricked&quot; some movements into thinking that they have

<p>Physical meetings and dead tree is considerably slower and more expensive.
<br>
You have to have to achieve a high physical density up to the point of
<br>
nonnegligible random encounter rate ere you can go that route. (Which,
<br>
imo, is an expiring model, anyway).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the raelians have a site too.  In itself it isn't enough, but
</em><br>
<p>So has the U.S. government.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; there is a false comfort in it that makes the movement neglect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important work in society around it, particularly since even today the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most important debates are not on the Internet.
</em><br>
<p>Of course not. It's too early for that. We're stuck mostly in early
<br>
adopter stage still.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We haven't seen that the Internet has acquired the position as
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Most people over 40 are hopeless in regards to Net skills. We'll have to
<br>
wait until the current power elite will be displaced from the office in a
<br>
natural process. Which will take decades.
<br>
<p>Once the current teenagers and twens wind up in charge situation will
<br>
become markedly different.
<br>
<p>Yours is an early adopter's view. I share your frustrations, but we must
<br>
learn patience.
