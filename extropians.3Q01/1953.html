<em>&gt; Not sure what you mean by 'ban,' but given that people naturally function in

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surely the constitution would allow laws that 'ban' certain types of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Since stealing and fraudulently misrepresenting are not crimes of
<br>
physical violence, they are financial and should not be considered, IMV,
<br>
to be crimes against the state. Also, in my view, I rarely see a case of
<br>
the family of a murder victim benefitting from the state's prosecution
<br>
of the murderer. They frequently wind up in serious financial straits,
<br>
which few  of the 'victims funds' that some states have set up are
<br>
prepared to deal with. My personal preference for dealing with murderers
<br>
is that first the victims family is allowed to recoup as much as
<br>
possible from the murderer and his/her assets, and only then when their
<br>
financial needs have been satisfied as much as possible should
<br>
punishments like execution or life imprisonment be imposed. Thus, civil
<br>
judgements under common law should have precedence over the state's
<br>
interests. Why? Because the state is subservient to the people, it only
<br>
exists as a function of the delegation of the individual's power, and
<br>
thus the individual who has been violated (and their dependents) carries
<br>
greater legal precedence and interest in a case than the state does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Any company may seek to purchase such liability protection from its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;insurance provider.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sort of liability protection is very different from the liability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protection granted by the state to corporate shareholders, limited partners,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of limited liability companies, etc. Presumably, the insurance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; company will pay the person wrongfully harmed, at least in some cases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Futhermore, in cases where the insured shareholders' carrier didn't provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adequate payment to the victim, the victim could seek recovery from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shareholders themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With state-granted limited liability, the victim is SOL. Even if he carries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his own insurance, his premium rates will go up when he files a claim.
</em><br>
<p>This is why I oppose the current state system. It should be the
<br>
corporations that insure themselves against their own bad behavior.
<br>
Their insurance company will be ascribed to a given PPL standard, and
<br>
engage with a given association of arbitrators to ajudicate that PPL
<br>
standard as it applies to the company's violations against others.
<br>
<p>The problem is that the current state system has through its monopoly
<br>
status as sole lawgiver, abrogated its responsibility to act as this
<br>
insurance company.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, I'm not sure what it means to say that they &quot;undermine free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; markets&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, here's an example: I decide to start a business selling a diet aid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that consists of tapeworm eggs in a capsule. The diet is quite successful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the first few months it's used by the consumer, and my business, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I call Svelte Belt, does very well. I decide to bring in some investors so I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can expand the business. Because shareholders in a corporation have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liability (beyond their investment in the corporation) for anything the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporation does, I'm able to persuade many people to invest in Svelte Belt,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Inc. by showing them my p&amp;l statement for the first year. They have no real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to examine my product closely, since all they stand to lose is their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investment. It's another year before the earlier users of Svelte Belt,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Inc.'s product begin experiencing health problems such as anemia. Several of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the pregnant users find that their babies' health has been affected by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product. When they discover that Svelte Belt's product is actually tape worm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eggs, they sue the company. But meanwhile, many of the shareholders of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Svelte Belt have taken their gains on their Svelte Belt stock. Maybe I, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; director and officer of Svelte Belt, Inc. will be held liable; but then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again, maybe not--it's pretty difficult to pierce the corporate veil.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is, under the present state 'monopoly of force' system. 
<br>
<p>Originally, the purpose of corporate limited liability was to limit the
<br>
individual liability of each investor to their fair share of any
<br>
liability judgement (much as the listers of Lloyds share in liabilities
<br>
equally), rather than each being found fully (severally) liable, where
<br>
the claimants could seize the entire value of the judgement from each
<br>
and every investor.
<br>
<p>Under the present system, the claimants don't get their money from the
<br>
investors directly, instead, the value of the investor's stock goes down
<br>
as the company's assets are drained by the imposition of the judgement
<br>
liability, and the company passes on the cost of the judgement to its
<br>
customers (who may or may not be the claimants who won the judgement in
<br>
the first place. The investors lose (temporarily) the value of their
<br>
stock from this liability, but are able to recoup this loss by fining
<br>
their customers for being so cheeky as to sue them.
<br>
<p>It should properly function that each investor turns over the value of
<br>
their share of the judgement, in stock in the company, to the claimants,
<br>
and thus the assets of the company remain the same and the customers do
<br>
not pay the cost of the judgement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At the very least, this distorts the capital market, since absent limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liability, companies such as Svelte Belt would not attract as many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investors. I'd predict that companies would tend to be smaller where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shareholders were responsible for the activities of their corporations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Investors would want to personally know, or at least know about, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporate decision makers; would want to know in detail about the products
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or services being sold.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but the real problem is not so much the liability issue, but the
<br>
legal finding of being severally liable. No investor wants to be ordered
<br>
to pay the full cost of a judgement, and making 100 investors each pay
<br>
100% of the cost is as unjust as making the customer pay for the
<br>
judgement they won against the company.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, far greater damage is done to the free market when corporations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form &quot;partnerships&quot; with government. All too often that's what happens, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one could presumably prevent that sort of situation, at least for a while,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by adhering to a properly drafted constitution. I say &quot;at least for a while&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because in practice, whenever a small group of people controls a significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per cent of the resources available to a population, the small group tends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to either collude with a government or to function as a government itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (by government, I mean a group of people exerting political power--that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say, power via force or the threat thereof--over the population as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole).
</em><br>
<p>Frankly, I find the political action of any group not described in the
<br>
constitution as a just player to be inherently subversive. There is no
<br>
need for individuals to act politically as a group in any unit outside
<br>
the local, state, or national level unless they are trying to subvert
<br>
the constitution prominence as a contract between individuals and only
<br>
individuals. An individual acting behind a veil is not a fair Bayesian
<br>
actor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Someone who has proven exceptional skills at managing capital should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;control of that capital.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is one of the problems of the perpetual duration aspect of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporation. The founder of a company may be very good at managing capital.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Her successors may be incompetent scoundrels. Well, okay, you might say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then someone else who's a better manager will come along and compete with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first corporation and drive it out of business. This won't always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen, though, when the first corporation is already firmly established.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This would be an example of an economic law you might call &quot;those who have,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get.&quot; The companies that prosper aren't always the best--in fact they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually aren't the best. Again, this problem is exacerbated by collusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between corporations and governments, but I don't believe such collusion is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required in order for the &quot;those who have, get&quot; law to hold.
</em><br>
<p>I think it is required. Why is it that corporations are able to get and
<br>
hold market share? Because the decision to buy is controlled by fewer
<br>
individuals than are in the whole group of buyers. When a corporation,
<br>
institution, or government is organized, the decision to buy a product
<br>
for all is delegated to few, and is therefore corruptible.
<br>
<p>This applies to manufacturers buying resources, distributors buying
<br>
products from manufacturers, and retailers buying from distributors, as
<br>
well as the degree of control over the media.
<br>
<p>When the liability actions of a corporations are excessively shielded by
<br>
the force of the state, corporations are much more free to accumulate
<br>
the assets which allow it to exert undue control over the market.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;Furthermore, I have yet to see anyone, still,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;contest my assertions about the individual's right to the product of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;their labor being the basis of capital accumulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see how this is relevant to whether or not corporations are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desirable. Surely you'd want the individual's right to the product of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labor to be bounded at the point where the individual's use of the product
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their labor is harmful to innocent people? 
</em><br>
<p>Of course. However, how many instances have you ever seen where the
<br>
government pays victims for their losses out of taxes or fines paid by
<br>
their victimizer? Never. Therefore, government doesn't work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;confiscation of saved labor by the state is slavery.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I take it you mean labor saved because of machinery, better methods of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production or service provision, etc. I don't see how this, either, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant to whether or not corporations are desirable. Could you please
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elaborate?
</em><br>
<p>No, that's not what I mean. If I work 40 hours a week, but my lifestyle
<br>
only consumes the value of 30 of those hours, I am able to save the
<br>
market value of 10 hours of work a week. In a year, I have 520 hours of
<br>
work saved, and in 30 years, I have 15,600 hours saved (1/4 of my entire
<br>
working life). 
<br>
<p>Under socialism, the presumption is that I owe those hours to society as
<br>
a debt to the past which not only brought me up by my 'village', but to
<br>
the increased productivity that the modern technology that 'society' has
<br>
developed that allowed me to have 10 surplus hours of work a week
<br>
(despite the fact that 'society' never invented anything), under the
<br>
presumption that a 'noble savage' would not have had that sort of
<br>
surplus labor (then how is it that we got to this point?), and that my
<br>
intelligence, creativity, and personal motives have absolutely nothing
<br>
to do with it.
<br>
<p>If it is not obvious, I entirely reject this claim of 'society' being
<br>
the agent of my success, and therefore deny it the claim to a right to
<br>
my surplus labor. I demonstrated by my fitness the ability to generate
<br>
surplus labor. If it were 'society' that created that surplus, it should
<br>
be able to create that surplus equally with all workers. Since it does
<br>
not, then it is evident that society is not the agency of my surplus
<br>
production, and therefore it has no right to it.
<br>
<p>Those who demonstrate the ability to best conserve their surplus labor
<br>
should be able to benefit society the greatest by being given sole
<br>
responsibility for that saved labor. An investment instrument is a tool,
<br>
as much as any hammer or shovel. When a laborer buys a hammer or shovel
<br>
for their personal use, they are investing in greater productivity, in
<br>
capital, and they are entitled to the product of that increased
<br>
productivity, because they invested with their own sweat to acquire it.
<br>
<p>The real question to ask is: does a person have the right to decide how
<br>
their surplus labor assets are to be used after their death, and to what
<br>
degree? I ask: How is enslaving the labor of a person while they are
<br>
alive any different from enslaving their labor after their death? A free
<br>
person has the right to decide how altruistic they wish to be, whether
<br>
to spread their wealth far and wide, or concentrate it in few hands. How
<br>
is distributing 100% of your saved labor equally as gifts to 100% of
<br>
society morally superior to distribution of it to only one person? It is
<br>
your free choice either way, so how can one choice be morally superior
<br>
than another? 
<br>
<p>Do we judge the choice by which one creates the greatest good for
<br>
society, or for all members of society, then? How do we judge what the
<br>
greatest good IS? If we do it in quantitative terms, it can be
<br>
quantitatively shown that placing wealth in the hands of those most able
<br>
to responsibly manage it produces the greatest good for all, because it
<br>
can generate greater productivity as an instrument of investment in
<br>
capital goods than in being consumed in perishable consumer items, and
<br>
those who do not have tend to have demonstrated their inability to
<br>
responsibly invest in capital for greater future productivity. On this
<br>
basis, capitalism is morally superior to socialism.
