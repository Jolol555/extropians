Robert Coyote asks,
<br>
<em>&gt; Is it possible that all the &quot;atrocities&quot; cause by Religion would just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely have happened for other reasons because religion was the excuse for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the acts, other excuses could have served the tyrants uses as substitutes?
</em><br>
<p>If so, then why didn't the tyrants use some other excuse? Why did they choose
<br>
religiosity? Tyrants can turn anything into religiosity it seems, except for
<br>
authentic science. Stalin made communism into a religion, and Mao Zedong did
<br>
approximately the same. Call it what you will, it still needs debunking, and
<br>
it's still anti-science. And there's no need to put the word atrocities in
<br>
quotation marks. They were real atrocities (though I don't think I used that
<br>
term, so you're not quoting me).
<br>
<p>Perhaps you've hit upon a good test to determine is something is real science:
<br>
If it can be turned into religiosity, then it's not science. If someone can
<br>
use it for an excuse to commit atrocities, then it's not real science.
<br>
<p>Hmmm... What does that say about politics? Debunk it?
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
