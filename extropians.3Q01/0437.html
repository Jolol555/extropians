<em>&gt;An important issue in the whole &quot;Transparent Society&quot; debate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hinges around how people in truth actually feel.  My guess is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that you are wrong here; I know I wouldn't have been at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bothered to know that the detective had been frequenting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same beach that I did.  I'm eager to know if others agree with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Steve here or with me.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>I'd be interested to find out too. I suspect that in society in general
<br>
there would be quite a sharp divide between those who weren't bothered and
<br>
the (minority?) who were and took steps to preserve their privacy. They
<br>
would probably be regarded as an anti-social cult, called &quot;the Privates&quot; or
<br>
some such term. Steve Davies
