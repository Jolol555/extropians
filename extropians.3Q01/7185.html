<p>
In Vietnam, there was a fairly open press and we saw lots of disturbing
<br>
pictures of bodies, screaming naked children, napalm, etc. In the Gulf
<br>
War, the press was under a great deal of control, and we saw lots of
<br>
pictures of precision guided weapons hitting bunkers and aqueducts and
<br>
stuff.
<br>
<p>So perhaps we should stop trying to answer the dorky, loser questions --
<br>
like how to win a worldwide war against terrorism or protect the U.S.
<br>
from further attacks -- and discuss the really tough question facing the
<br>
military-infotainment complex today: namely how to produce the war to
<br>
get the best ratings.
<br>
<p>Somehow I doubt showing million dollar missiles slamming into tents is
<br>
gonna do it. After a few press conferences with Powell or whoever
<br>
running videos and saying: &quot;Here's the terrorist jeep. Now you see the
<br>
missile coming in, and there's the direct hit on the jeep&quot;, people are
<br>
gonna get tired of that. And they have to show something or uppity
<br>
members of the press may decide to try and do their own stories. Like
<br>
more and more interviews with tearful relatives of the WTC victims.
<br>
<p>One choice is showing blown-up buildings. Unfortunately I'm sure the
<br>
sign-making industries in terrorist-supporting countries are busy
<br>
churning out 'Baby Milk Plant', 'Orphanage', 'Children's Hospital', and
<br>
'Pharmaceutical Factory' signs by the boatload and distributing them
<br>
around the countryside, for quick placement at bombed sites before the
<br>
media arrives. This might also be an opportunity for countries with a
<br>
high infant and child mortality rate to make some extra bucks by
<br>
preserving and stocking up on corpses to scatter around bombed sites
<br>
along with the signs.
<br>
<p>I suppose they could show bodies again. They don't even need to be real,
<br>
just shovel some sand in a body bag and lay'em out in neat rows.
<br>
Captured weapons caches are another possibility, and again there's
<br>
plenty of file footage available. Maybe a gov't buy-back program for
<br>
AK47s would be useful here.
