----- Original Message -----

From: &lt;<a href="mailto:JoshCahoon@cs.com?Subject=Re:%20origin%20of%20ideas,%20civilization,%20reading%20list&In-Reply-To=&lt;01fb01c11e01$0f8ec560$9f5be218@hala1.on.home.com&gt;">JoshCahoon@cs.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just out of curiosity, I'm wondering how many on this list feel they came
</em><br>
up
<br>
<em>&gt; with the idea of the singularity on their own. I feel like I did, and was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprised to find an organization based, in large part, on the concept.
</em><br>
There is nothing new under the sun (I may not have been the first to say
<br>
this). Transhumanism is a minor variant on an ancient theme. Plato and
<br>
Aristotle said the (1) telos of humanity's best (i.e., philosophers) is to
<br>
become godlike, (2) that we ought to become godlike, and (3) that
<br>
dialectical reasoning is the means for philosophers to realize their telos.
<br>
Unlike Plato and Aristotle (Hegel, etc.) we do not believe that there is a
<br>
little divine element in us that needs to be nurtured. Darwin killed that
<br>
idea forever. So, transhumanists substitute technology (most notably genetic
<br>
engineering and AI) for (3). What separates us from Plato et al is a minor
<br>
quibble about the means to become what we ought to be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That brings me to a broader issue: I wonder to what extent important ideas
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; humanity's development owe their geneses to individuals versus the
</em><br>
zeitgeist
<br>
<em>&gt; of the times. Evolution by natural selection would almost surely have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discovered without Darwin and Wallace. Discovery of the structure of DNA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really didn't need Francis and Crick. General relativity? I dunno.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if we could settle this question, would that have any important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences for how we should try to acheive an extropian future? For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, if we could convince ourselves that the ideas and technologies
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; will foster the kind of future we want will owe their origins, in large
</em><br>
part,
<br>
<em>&gt; to the general intellectual climate of the times, then we might see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; augmenting intelligence as a less important means than influencing
</em><br>
societal
<br>
<em>&gt; views.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Why? Suppose we find that Chimp views are shaped more by chimp zeitgeist
<br>
than chimp geniuses like Kanzi. If their goal was to improve their wisdom
<br>
wouldn't they still be better off to adopt technology that would allow them
<br>
to augment their intelligence to become human, or more? Perhaps I am missing
<br>
your point. Mark.
