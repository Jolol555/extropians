<p>The strong version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis basically
<br>
says that language *determines* thought and behavior.
<br>
<p>The weak version basically says that language *has some
<br>
influence* on thought and behavior.
<br>
<p>Opponents of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis typically attack
<br>
only the strong version while failing to even mention the
<br>
weak version.

<p>The best book I know of covering this is 'The Language

Imperative: The Power of Language to Enrich Your Life
<br>
and Expand Your Mind' by Suzette Haden Elgin

<p>About the Author
<br>
Suzette Haden Elgin received her Ph.D. from the
<br>
University of California, San Diego. A specialist in
<br>
applied psycholinguistics, she is the author of the
<br>
best-selling Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense series,
<br>
which consists of thirteen books and two audio
<br>
programs. She is also the founder and director
<br>
of the Ozark Center for Language Studies.
<br>
<p>Book Description
<br>
How multilingualism enhances the human experience
<br>
and why our decisions about &quot;English Only&quot; language
<br>
policies are shortsighted. Many of us view language as
<br>
a tool, a means by which to communicate our thoughts
<br>
and emotions. But is there more to language than just
<br>
&quot;talk&quot;? Can learning languages actually change the way
<br>
you think? In The Language Imperative, best-selling
<br>
author and linguistic scholar Suzette Haden Elgin
<br>
examines the power of language to shape our lives.
<br>
She confronts some of the most pressing issues parents
<br>
and educators face today: Is it a good or bad idea for
<br>
Americans to have command of more than one language?
<br>
Should learning languages be a luxury for only the rich?
<br>
Or should it be a goal of the public educational system
<br>
as well? Based on solid science and filled with personal
<br>
insights, The Language Imperative is required reading
<br>
for anyone interested in how words shape our lives,
<br>
both as individuals and as a nation.
