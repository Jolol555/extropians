</em><br>
<p>Yes. I think the self-expression part is just as important as
<br>
improved functionality. After all, why do we want better
<br>
functionality? To achieve our individual goals, i.e. to become more
<br>
a person whose life is defined by ourselves rather than external
<br>
chance. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The cyborg debates in academia centre on the cyborg, or machine

</em><br>
<p>Institutions evolve over time. Some do not adapt and either become
<br>
irrelevant, circumvented, break down or have to act to impose their
<br>
structure onto people to remain in existence. Others adapt, and
<br>
that means they will change, sometimes to the extent that core
<br>
ideas and values vanish and just the name remains, sometimes by
<br>
retaining their cores but changing everything else. (There is a
<br>
lesson here for life extension, too).  As more radical
<br>
possibilities of self-transformation become possible, institutions
<br>
will be involved both in shaping how they are applied and be
<br>
changed by their existence and application. What traditional
<br>
boundaries will remain will depend on how well they can be
<br>
supported by such instutions - including &quot;mental institutions&quot; like
<br>
our own self-image and assumptions about humanity. 
<br>
<p>It seems that in a global, pluralistic society there will always be
<br>
somebody challenging the current institutions somewhere (and
<br>
through modern communications each challenge will be broadcast to
<br>
many others), making it far harder for institutions to compell
<br>
obedience to their ideal human shapes, and the only truly resilient
<br>
boundaries will emerge from the traditional human condition itself.
<br>
Some will of course transgress these, but they will likely remain a
<br>
minority for a long time until the concept of traditional humanity
<br>
has itself been enlarged in culture and individual psychology.
