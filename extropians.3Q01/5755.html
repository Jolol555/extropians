Another place to look is Robin Hanson's paper on economic growth
<br>
acceleration, <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/longgrow.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/longgrow.html</a>.  This does not try to
<br>
tote up signs of progress, which are varied and ever-changing.  Instead it
<br>
goes to basics, looking at the raw data on total economic productivity,
<br>
the sum total of the economic output of the entire human race, looking
<br>
at progress not just over decades or centuries, but all the way back to
<br>
cave man days.
<br>
<p>Robin fits the curve with a fairly simple formula and finds that human
<br>
history can be divided into periods of exponential growth, where the
<br>
fundamental growth rate has varied between periods.  The growth rate
<br>
can be expressed as the doubling time, the time it takes for economic
<br>
output to double.
<br>
<p>He identifies an early, pre-technology period, when biological evolution
<br>
seemed to dominate, with a doubling time of 34M years; a transition to
<br>
a hunting based economy with a doubling time of 224K years; a farming
<br>
economy with a doubling time of 904 years; and finally an industrial
<br>
economy with a doubling time of 6.3 years.
<br>
<p>Looking world-wide, we are still in the transition from farming to
<br>
industrial phases.  Current economic growth rates correspond to a doubling
<br>
time of about 20 years.  By this model we would expect this to decrease
<br>
to about 6 years over the next few decades.
<br>
<p>The increase in the rate of economic growth over the 20th century is
<br>
tangible and measurable data which directly drives the quality of life
<br>
and improvements in standard of living.  Weighing washing machines
<br>
against cell phones is a more difficult basis to make a comparison.
<br>
<p>The tantalizing part about Robin's analysis is the possibility of a future
<br>
transition to a new post-industrial economic mode.  The productivity
<br>
data doesn't show it directly, but broadly speaking we are due for
<br>
a change, and of course as Extropians it is easy to anticipate one.
<br>
But based on the changes we have seen in the past from mode to mode,
<br>
each one has a doubling time maybe 100 times faster than the one before.
<br>
That would imply that the new mode could have an economic doubling time
<br>
of just a few weeks!
<br>
<p>It's beyond my imagination to conceive of what a world would be like where
<br>
economic output doubled that fast.  Average personal wealth would increase
<br>
by factors of thousands or even millions every year.  Obviously such a
<br>
transition would imply fundamental changes in the human condition.
<br>
<p>Of course it is risky to extrapolate data like this, but Robin's curve
<br>
fitting is impressively accurate, and it would be a departure from
<br>
the historical pattern if we never saw another transition.  Whether it
<br>
would be as extreme as the previous transitions remains to be seen, but
<br>
looking at even just the potential future technologies we know about,
<br>
never mind the ones we haven't thought of, it certainly seems possible.
