<em>&gt; What about LED's?
</em><br>
<p>LEDs are more efficient than compact fluorescent, however they are also
<br>
more expensive. For approximately twice the price, you save only an
<br>
additional 10-20% of the original incandescent wattage. This will likely
<br>
change over time, and there are niche applications where LEDs make a lot
<br>
of sense, like traffic lights, exit signs, floor level pathway lighting,
<br>
and personal illumination devices like book lamps, etc. Further on down
<br>
the line, Electroluminescent technology will eventually replace area
<br>
illuminate applications, but I think this will require some advances in
<br>
nanotech before such technology can provide the lifecycle needed to pay
<br>
off the increased cost. An EL lamp is essentially a flat capacitor, with
<br>
an opaque conductive back layer (usually a silver paint), a transparent
<br>
conductive front layer (usually indium/tin oxide), and a
<br>
electroluminescent doped dielectric material in the middle (typically a
<br>
complex phosphor compound). The alternating electrostatic field provided
<br>
by an alternating current stimulates the phosphor to produce light. The
<br>
problems with this lamp include a half-life-like degradation of the
<br>
phosphor compound in reaction to the ingress of moisture over time, as
<br>
well as arcing between front and back layers through flaws in the
<br>
substrate. Moisture based degradation can be mitigated by encapsulating
<br>
phosphors within material that acts as moisture barriers or dessicants,
<br>
as well as laminating the whole lamp within impermeable moisture barrier
<br>
materials while still remaining transparent enough for effective light
<br>
transmission.
<br>
<p>EL lamps are generally produced by silk-screen printing techniques,
<br>
though there has been research in high resolution printing with more
<br>
modern processes of regulated compound deposition. This has mostly
<br>
occured in the area of using EL lamps as pixelated flat panel displays
<br>
rather than as general lighting sources. The major problems with EL for
<br>
bright illumination applications is the difficulty in concentrating
<br>
sufficient phosphors within the dielectric while keeping front and back
<br>
electrodes close enough for efficient dielectric density but far enough
<br>
to limit arc-over related failures. I expect that these problems will
<br>
only be resolved when lamps can be constructed by assemblers on an atom
<br>
by atom basis.
