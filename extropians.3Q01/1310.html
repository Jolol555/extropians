I got a kick out of this:
<br>
<p>&quot;Delphi Oracle was high on vapors
<br>
<p>US geologists have found the long-lost crack in the Earth's crust below
<br>
the
<br>
Delphi Oracle. They thus confirm reports by classical writers claiming
<br>
that
<br>
the oracle's visions were induced by vapors seeping from the Earth's
<br>
interior.
<br>
<p>For over 2,000 years, Greeks and Romans made pilgrimages to Delphi to
<br>
seek advice from the oracle. Classical writers report that the
<br>
prophecies came from a woman in a trance, concealed in a narrow chamber.
<br>
The Roman writer Plutarch already suspected that sweetish-smelling
<br>
vapors from the Earth were responsible for the trance. However, to date
<br>
geologists had searched in vain for a fissure from which such vapors
<br>
might have escaped.
<br>
<p>Now, the researchers finally found what they had been looking for - they
<br>
found that two faults cross directly under the oracle. Seismic activity
<br>
may
<br>
have heated the underground in the vicinity of these cracks and made
<br>
them
<br>
leak gases. A nearby spring even shows which gases might have been
<br>
involved: beyond methane, the water also contains ethylene, a gas known
<br>
for its hallucinogenic effects.

<br>
<p>This reminds me on a Simpsons episode: People heard the voice of a dead
<br>
woman when they stood in front of her statue. Later it turned out that
<br>
there was a gas leak in the ground underneath the statue...
