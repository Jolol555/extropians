</em><br>
<p>An unqualified guaranteed minimum  income  may be better than our (U.S.)
<br>
current welfare system.  However, if such a program were tax supported, it
<br>
still involves forcibly taking assets from one person to fund another persons
<br>
lifestyle.  It's obvious to see how the person who receives the subsidy
<br>
benefits, as well as how the people from whom the money is taken lose out.
<br>
But also keep in mind the cleaning man who isn't hired because the extra cash
<br>
that would've been used to pay for his services is instead paying for some guy
<br>
to play pinball all day.  Or the scientific researcher who can't get the
<br>
capital to commercialize her research, because the money's instead funnelled to
<br>
people inscribing the Koran on toothpicks.  (I know, many (perhaps most)
<br>
recipients wouldn't engage in frivolous activities.  However, if you can't
<br>
persuade others to pay enough to finance your work, then from their
<br>
perspective, the capital is being misallocated, no matter how deserving you
<br>
believe yourself to be. )
<br>
<p>In addition, unless the recipient is responsible, wouldn't they simply lose the
<br>
money anyway?  By gambling, for example, or purchasing goods on credit (using
<br>
their guaranteed income as collateral).    Then they will be as impoverished as
<br>
before (except that they will have misallocated capital originally earned by
<br>
someone else).  Ultimately, I think that unless an individual has learned to
<br>
handle money, external subsidies will only temporarily relieve financial
<br>
stress.
<br>
<p>That said, I think becoming financially independent on one's own is a quite
<br>
worthwhile goal.   I've come across several resources that may be of interest
<br>
to those who want to  develop their own voluntary &quot;guaranteed minimum income&quot;:
