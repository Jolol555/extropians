</em><br>
<em>&gt; (by fostering inventions that increase efficiency).
</em><br>
<p>Forget pet rocks -- they're spurious -- and think PDAs, laptops, new
<br>
technowidgets, new cosmetic surgery; in other words, forms of consumption
<br>
that are based on technological innovation. That's most of them, these
<br>
days. (Let's face it, if you want to live by buying raw vegetables and
<br>
meat and cooking them and by buying fabric and making your own clothing,
<br>
you can do so -- and on a pittance, because those items are dirt cheap
<br>
in the developed world. Most consumer spending goes elsewhere, these
<br>
days.)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
What you've put your finger on is the tradeoff between value created
<br>
by money invested in growth and value created by broadening the market
<br>
base.
<br>
<p>I'd assert that focussing on investment for future growth alone is a
<br>
mistake. If everyone put their money into VC risk funds, they're
<br>
not going to have any money left over to buy the products of those
<br>
risky start-up companies. Ergo, those start-ups aren't going to survive!
<br>
<p>The two kinds of money are going into different phases of the business
<br>
life-cycle: either at the beginning, seeding new ventures (the VC
<br>
money) or during the life of the company, buying their products. Our
<br>
economy needs both types of investment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I cannot find merit in this thread (so far) because it fails to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; account for the multiplier effect(s) of the allocation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; income by an &quot;average&quot; person compared with the multiplier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect(s) of the allocation of income by a &quot;wealthy&quot; person.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I think you'll find that extremely difficult to establish. For example,
<br>
in the UK there are tax loopholes for certain types of small investment
<br>
that give ordinary workers an incentive to put money into certain types
<br>
of long-term (seven year) investment trusts. Thus, those ordinary workers
<br>
are _also_ contributing to the VC funds. Meanwhile, our hypothetical
<br>
wealthy executive still can't occupy more than one automobile or aircraft
<br>
seat simultaneously. They may have two or more orders of magnitude more
<br>
money coming in than an ordinary worker, but they won't consume two or
<br>
more orders of magnitude more &quot;stuff&quot;; if anything, they're more likely
<br>
to be at the painted-rock end of the consumption spectrum (buying works 
<br>
of art as investments, building dream homes), which doesn't further
<br>
technological investment very effectively.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, if someone were to make the case that a majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealthy (or highly compensated) executives spend a majority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their wealth in non-productive ways -- then I would have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sit back and rethink my position.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I can't make that case; some individuals doubtless convert their
<br>
wealth into gold bullion and have it melted down and turned into a
<br>
bathtub, but others do useful things with it. For example, Bill Gates --
<br>
whose company I detest -- has nevertheless done something I quite admire
<br>
recently; he's allocated a not-inconsiderable sum ($750M) to a public
<br>
health scheme in south-east Asia that's intended to eliminate about four
<br>
diseases that are endemic there today but considered diseases of poverty
<br>
in the developed world. In doing so he's improving the quality of life of
<br>
millions.
