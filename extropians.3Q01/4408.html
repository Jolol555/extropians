<p>But why should you *care* what he says that's congruent with the common

stock of [provisionally accepted and publicly corroborated] knowledge about

the world? You can get that nourishment from many less polluted streams,

and you won't need to spend so much effort waiting for the sly trickery to
<br>
be infiltrated in with it. Of course, compensating for, and laughing at,

sly trickery is fun, up to a point, and good for your immune system, as you

say.
