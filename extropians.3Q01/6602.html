&lt;Hmmm... I feel unease...
<br>
I'm certain you weren't being racist when you said this, and basically I
<br>
agree with what you said, but in this time of furiously swinging pendulums
<br>
I think it is worth reminding everyone that Israel is not one entity any
<br>
more than the Palestine or America or Australia is. It is millions of
<br>
individuals. They share land, and in many cases they may share certain
<br>
mindsets, but humans are so variable that it is extremely hard to
<br>
categorise them as a group.&gt;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your unease is not suprising... most persons in the west have this
<br>
odd cognitive dissonance thing going on when they are faced with
<br>
the statement that Israel is an ethnostate built on apartheid and
<br>
blood. Naturally they think ethnostates are not good, apartheid
<br>
and blood are even worse (examples of supreme evil perhaps),
<br>
but they also have this trouble facing the reality of just how far
<br>
the rot goes. I will note here that I am slamming Tel Aviv, and
<br>
the democratically elected leaders of Israel.  I do not jump to
<br>
the conclusion that this racist mindset is present in the Jewish
<br>
people or in the Israeli &quot;people&quot; (as distinct from their government).
<br>
<p>&lt;It is scary that because of some extremely unwise decisions by policy
<br>
makers in Israel (undoubtedly impelled by seige mentality and having the
<br>
most powerful ally, as well as commonly held belief of religious
<br>
righteousness) the people on those lands and their relatives abroad (Jewish
<br>
people) might once again come under attack. We have to be careful in our
<br>
use of inflammatory words because of their magnifying effect in dangerous
<br>
times. In these times words can literally kill.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do differ on what we consider &quot;unneccessarily
<br>
inflamatory&quot;. But the European West is slowly struggling
<br>
&nbsp;above the &quot;tribal&quot; mentality (I myself tend to get all
<br>
tribal when I am pissed), and we can't afford
<br>
let rampant tribalism find support in the synagoges
<br>
&nbsp;(and mosques and churchs!) of the West.  Tribalism
<br>
&nbsp;with a gun and a large organization is ...well that
<br>
&nbsp;N-word comes to mind.
<br>
<p>&lt;Of all the people I have met and enjoyed the company of, those who called
<br>
themselves Jews have been among my favorites. It would be terrible if due
<br>
to some opportunistic policy makers in Israel those people everywhere came
<br>
under threat.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I like lots of Jews myself. Nevertheless my plea
<br>
is that the remarkably cohesive Jewish community
<br>
decide once and for all where their priorities are.
<br>
Is America first (which includes a strong vibrant
<br>
Hebrew culture doing all those things they do best)
<br>
or is a apartheid Hebrew ethnostate build by
<br>
brutal and unrelenting force in the Middle East
<br>
more important than America? I DO think the choice
<br>
needs to be made. I strongly believe that the
<br>
prescence of people who have chosen choice &quot;B&quot;
<br>
inflames and aggravates the Far Right in this
<br>
country and lends aid and comfort by opposition
<br>
to tribalism amongst Euros.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tribe or nation..and which nation? Simple
<br>
decison. So I don't wind up doing EEGs on
<br>
more young sailors who wind up with brain
<br>
damage from a ship blowing up while defending
<br>
the interests of a foreign power with avowed
<br>
goals counter to American principles of
<br>
freedom and tolerance.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
Brian
