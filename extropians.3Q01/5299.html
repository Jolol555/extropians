<em>&gt;It is interesting to note that the journal Nature has a section for art
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in science / science in art. I wonder how many art journals have that?
</em><br>
<p>Leonardo magazine has been around for many years.  It's excellent.  Nature
<br>
tends approaches art and science in a more traditional way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The renaissance involved trying to create something new that unified the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;old knowledge with the new scientific/economic/artistic discoveries, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then change society accordingly (although this later part only really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;got underway during the enlightenment). I see many similarities with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;today: we need a new renaissance to unify the old knowledge with the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discoveries and then find ways of changing our societies accordingly. 
</em><br>
<p>This is the new Enlightenment (transhumanity) which Greg presented about at
<br>
Extro-5, Max wrote about in Exponent, and I presented at Extro-2.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The fact that there are people trying to bridge the two cultures and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;create a new synthesis isn't enough, as long as they stand fairly alone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and unsupported. What made the daring transdisciplinary work of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;renaissance so important was that it took place in a cultural context
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where it gained support and influence - the actual number of humanists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientists, artists and engineers were fairly low, but they affected
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society profoundly through various channels. Had these channels not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stood open, their effect would have been marginal and the renaissance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;soon forgotten. We need to find the modern counterparts of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;channels of reaching into society and for creating a cultural context
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that promotes synthesis. 
</em><br>
<p>The numerous electronic art conferences approach this synthesis Anders.  In
<br>
fact, for the past decade, these conferences have been inviting scientists
<br>
to give key talks.  (Robin Hanson won an art award some years ago, which I
<br>
thought was great.)
<br>
<p>The best way to &quot;infiltrate&quot; the environments which you are referring to is
<br>
to be there.  It is not a game plan, it is a presence.  Ideas permeate best
<br>
at the comfort zone level where people do not feel pressured.  Going into
<br>
an environment and pushing an agenda is usually met with a counter force.
<br>
Going in an introducing an agenda through persuasive credibility and a
<br>
collaborative spirit is usually met with a welcome.
<br>
<p>I recall this same issue was brought up at Extro-4 by your colleague and
<br>
which I debated at that time, quite heatedly.  CP Snow was referenced
<br>
incorrectly, which I addressed and I even bonked a few people on the head
<br>
who were dogmatic about the separation between art and science.  I refuted
<br>
this, perhaps too assertively, but nonetheless the points I made then are
<br>
the same one's I make today.  We cannot look at art the with the same eyes
<br>
as we recollect history.  Nor could the Renaissance recall the times of
<br>
cave dwellers with the same consciousness of the time they lived in.  We
<br>
are at a very different time in history and our parameters are different.
<br>
Art today is not what it was in the Renaissance.  In fact, most people do
<br>
not recognize or realize what art is today.  It is the understanding and
<br>
acceptance of what the symbol of  today's technology presents in regards to
<br>
culture and what those of use who are transhumanists and other futurists
<br>
actually think about.  The art that reflects this may not be plentiful, but
<br>
it is art nonetheless.  The art that reflects this may not look  or fell
<br>
like art of the past, but it is art nonetheless.  the art that reflects
<br>
this may not even be available to critique because it is still being
<br>
conceptualized, but it is art nonetheless.  The art that reflects this may
<br>
be so ordinary that we don't even consider it art, but it is art
<br>
nonetheless.  One of my most favored pieces of sculpture today is the Seti
<br>
Telescope.  Some of the most interesting art today is done digitally and
<br>
exhibited on the Internet, or in the think-tanks of scientific laboratories.
<br>
<p><p>We cannot view art by the museum's standards or the standards of the
<br>
mundane critic who is looking under rocks with a flashlight for new art.
<br>
If so, we might as well get on the stagecoach and head back across the
<br>
Rockies.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
