<em>&gt; &gt; Okay, it's time for me to confess to that also---I would be

<em>&gt; &gt; questions come up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes.  I in good consciience advocate it.  I do so because I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe it is essential to our long term wellbeing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thriving.  Now, the hard question is how to successfully get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think even in a society of guaranteed income, we would see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; most people working to better themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That depends on the people!  Your statements apply to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sets of people in history, but very, very few.  In the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; United States, I don't think that the number of people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would continue working would be adequate, because too many have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very dull, routine jobs, and too many (like me) have better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things to do with their time.  The memes of industriousness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hard work, prudence, and self-reliance would have to be a hell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of a lot stronger than they are now to make a go of it at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; present time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We hamstring ourselves both when we ignore history and when we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think that tomorrow is a repeat of yesterday of necessity.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conditions of a truly abundant society of free and open
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information are very different than anything that has goine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before.  In a society where all the physical necessities of life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are already present and where there are ample and open
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opportunities to explore and grow there is nothhing left to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but better yourself or simply hang out.  The latter eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gets pretty boring.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hard work?  I work the hardest for things I truly love, not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;express some meme.  Why should it be considered &quot;hard&quot;?  Why not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deeply focused and joyfully engaged in?  Prudence?  There will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be some reasons for care but the danger of falling into economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ruin will not be one of them.  I bit that danger adieu as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;joyously as I bid sickness and death adieu.  Self-reliance?  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are all in this together.  Self-responsibility is one thing but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the notion you can only rely on yourself or that your own caring
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and responsibility extends only to you and the few you claim to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;love is simply not an essential aspect of existence as it is nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is it necessary for a healthy and vibrant people.  Of course it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;depends on what you mean by the term.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it will be an incredible world when because of A.I. and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mature nanotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; we see homelessness, poverty and lack of good medical care wiped 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away.  I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; like to see housing, power and food become very cheap so that people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; even fathom the way 20th and early 21st century have-nots lived.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, that'll be great.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; And I do not see this destroying the traditions of personal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; People will just move up on Maslow's pyramid to achieve higher needs 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and wants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; As I have already written here, the desire for status will do us well 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; coming age of incredible prosperity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think that you're still talking about people like you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the people you know.  A majority of people will just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; non-stop party when their ship comes in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think a lot more people &quot;like us&quot; would be created in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kind of world.  Non-stop party gets boring eventually.  Those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that want to do that can do it to their hearts content with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;little consequence except the boredom and meaninglessness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it.  They will burn out on it eventually.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now, there is a question in such speculations.  And that is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to do with the people who don't want to live in such relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paradisical situations.   Should room be left virtually or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actually for those who simply insist on living a life where most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of their time and energy is spent anxiously maintaining a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;living&quot; and chasing after many things of the &quot;good life&quot; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are by design either not obtainable to all or that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dissappear so easily as to keep up anxiety levels to make them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more productive and &quot;industrious&quot;?  Should we keep room for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those who wish to &quot;make a living&quot; rather than living a life?
</em><br>
