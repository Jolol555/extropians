<em>&gt; This must be why neurosuspension hasn't caught on widely: the 'feeling'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; masses are being justifiably told by their more dominant brain that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't want to be left behind...
</em><br>
<p>No, not at all. The enteric nervous system is not &quot;dominant,&quot; the reason you
<br>
don't want to be uploaded without your enteric nervous system (ENS) is that
<br>
your ENS contains hundreds of millions of neurons which interact with the rest
<br>
of the CNS (central nervous system) to form the complete neurological
<br>
structure that is you.

<p>The Second Brain : The Scientific Basis of Gut Instinct and a Groundbreaking
<br>
New Understanding of Nervous Disorders of the Stomach and Intestines
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060182520/002-8722264-6800022">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060182520/002-8722264-6800022</a>
<br>
Did you ever tell someone that they think with their stomach? Then you're on
<br>
the cutting edge of scientific thought, according to researcher Michael D.
<br>
Gershon. The title of his book The Second Brain refers to the hundred million
<br>
nerve cells in and around our guts that often act entirely independently of
<br>
the dictator inside our heads. This isn't so bad--there are some meals we'd
<br>
rather not have to think about eating, much less digesting. Gershon tells us
<br>
the stories of his development into a scientist, his determination to promote
<br>
neurogastroenterology as a legitimate field of research, and the nature of
<br>
&quot;the brain gone south,&quot; all with humor and aplomb.
<br>
Though not for the overly squeamish (after all, even if Gershon were to pull
<br>
his punches, his subject still carries traces of old taboos), The Second Brain
<br>
is a lively and invigorating read. The illustrations are superb and well
<br>
labeled; this complements the text, which ranges from clinical to personal, as
<br>
when the author details the events leading to his mother's tragic death
<br>
following unnecessary surgery for an ulcer. The interactions between the
<br>
enteric nervous system and digestion, emotion, and disease are not simple, but
<br>
Gershon's patient prose explains everything in terms any interested layperson
<br>
can understand.
<br>
As in the best scientific works, The Second Brain informs and inspires,
<br>
surprising the reader with unexpected complexities and mysteries arising in
<br>
such a seemingly primitive venue. It makes excellent after-dinner
<br>
reading. --Rob Lightner
<br>
Jacqueline Boone, The New York Times Book Review
<br>
In ,&quot;The Second Brain, Gershon makes a persuasive, impassioned and, at times,
<br>
downright lyrical case...the book succeeds in presenting an often grim and
<br>
complex topic in a surprisingly witty and engaging manner&quot;

Wyoming researcher studies 'second brain' in gut tissues
<br>
When we eat a meal, we're generally confident that our bodies will process the
<br>
fuel efficiently and naturally. After all, it's been happening continuously
<br>
since the day we were born. But what is it really that we are placing our
<br>
faith in?
<br>
&quot;It used to be thought that this is a simple system to study, but there are as
<br>
many neurons in the gut as there are in the spinal cord,&quot; Wade said.
<br>
<p>According to Gershon, this system is also critical for our emotional
<br>
well-being.

<p>Enteric nervous system
<br>
<a href="http://208.154.71.60/bcom/eb/article/4/0,5716,119944+4+110704,00.html">http://208.154.71.60/bcom/eb/article/4/0,5716,119944+4+110704,00.html</a>
<br>
The enteric nervous system is made up of two plexuses, or networks of neurons,
<br>
embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. The outermost collection,
<br>
lying between the inner circular and outer longitudinal smooth-muscle layers
<br>
of the gut, is called the myenteric (or Auerbach's) plexus. Neurons of this
<br>
plexus regulate the peristaltic waves, consisting of polarized muscular
<br>
activity, that move digestive products from oral to anal openings. In
<br>
addition, myenteric neurons control local muscular contractions that are
<br>
responsible for stationary mixing and churning. The innermost group of neurons
<br>
is called the submucosal (or Meissner's) plexus. This group regulates the
<br>
configuration of the luminal surface, controls glandular secretions, alters
<br>
electrolyte and water transport, and regulates local blood flow.
<br>
Three functional classes of intrinsic enteric neurons are recognized: sensory
<br>
neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons. Sensory neurons, activated by either
<br>
mechanical or chemical stimulation of the innermost surface of the gut,
<br>
transmit information to interneurons located within the myenteric and
<br>
submucosal plexi, and the interneurons relay the information to motor neurons.
<br>
Motor neurons in turn modulate the activity of a variety of target cells,
<br>
including mucous glands, smooth muscle cells, endocrine cells, epithelial
<br>
cells, and blood vessels.
<br>
Extrinsic neural pathways also are involved in the control of gastrointestinal
<br>
functions. Three types exist: intestinofugal, sensory, and motor.
<br>
Intestinofugal neurons reside in the gut wall; they send their axons to the
<br>
preaortic sympathetic ganglia and control reflex arcs that involve large
<br>
portions of the gastrointestinal tract. Sensory neurons relay information
<br>
regarding distention (pain) and acidity into the central nervous system. There
<br>
are two types of sensory neurons: sympathetic neurons, which originate from
<br>
dorsal-root ganglia found at the thoracic and lumbar levels; and
<br>
parasympathetic neurons, which originate in the nodose ganglion of the tenth
<br>
cranial nerve (vagus) or in dorsal-root ganglia at sacral levels S2-S4. The
<br>
former innervate the entire gastrointestinal tract from the pharynx to the
<br>
left colic flexure, and the latter innervate the distal colon and rectum. Each
<br>
portion of the gastrointestinal tract receives a dual sensory innervation:
<br>
pain sensations travel via sympathetic afferents, and sensations that signal
<br>
information regarding the chemical milieu of the gut travel by way of
<br>
parasympathetic fibres and are not consciously perceived.
<br>
The third extrinsic pathway, exercising motor control over the gut, arises
<br>
from parasympathetic preganglionic neurons found in the dorsal vagal nucleus
<br>
of the medulla and from sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the lateral horns
<br>
of the spinal cord. These outflows provide modulatory commands to the
<br>
intrinsic enteric motor system and are nonessential in that basic functions
<br>
can be maintained in their absence.
<br>
Through the pathways described above, the parasympathetic system activates
<br>
digestive processes while the sympathetic system inhibits them. The
<br>
sympathetic system inhibits digestive processes by two mechanisms: (1)
<br>
contraction of circular smooth muscle sphincters located in the distal portion
<br>
of the stomach (pyloric sphincter), small intestine (ileo-cecal sphincter),
<br>
and rectum (internal anal sphincter), which act as valves to prevent the
<br>
oral-to-anal passage (as well as reverse passage) of digestive products; and
<br>
(2) inhibition of motor neurons throughout the length of the gut. In contrast,
<br>
the parasympathetic system provides messages only to myenteric motor neurons.
