I've often asked, &quot;If freedom is so good, and so many great minds
<br>
have praised and promoted it, then why is freedom in danger of
<br>
being wiped out?&quot; One of my answers to this question is that
<br>
&quot;government&quot; is the main enemy of freedom, but nobody I know
<br>
of has come even close to accurately describing &quot;government&quot;
<br>
and communicating such an accurate description widely.
<br>
<p>In 1994, I wrote Report #TL07B: THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07b.shtml">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07b.shtml</a>&gt;.
<br>
<p>According to Craig Green, [this is the] &quot;Most PROFOUND Essay
<br>
On The Subject&quot; &lt;<a href="http://pw2.netcom.com/~zeno7/index.html">http://pw2.netcom.com/~zeno7/index.html</a>&gt;.
<br>
<p>&quot;* I would CERTAINLY have been saved from a huge amount of pain
<br>
if I'd been privileged enough to read this article/essay 10 years ago.
<br>
* The only thing that I didn't like about it was that I didn't write it!
<br>
* This is the most freedom-producing/fear-destroying article I've
<br>
ever been privileged to read!
<br>
* NOW, clarity seems more clear to me!
<br>
* THANK YOU.&quot; -- Rick (26 Jul 2001)

<p>What would happen if a significant number of people (say, 10 or
<br>
12) were to gain certain &quot;deeper understandings&quot; of the &quot;nature
<br>
of government&quot; and also developed the ability to communicate
<br>
this to others in a manner that would enable them in turn to gain
<br>
these &quot;deeper understandings&quot; and help them spread?
<br>
<p>In DEEP ANARCHY -- AN ELIMINATIVIST VIEW OF &quot;THE STATE&quot;
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.shtml">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.shtml</a>&gt;, Max T. O'Connor
<br>
(aka Max More) discusses related &quot;deeper understandings.&quot;
<br>
He coined the term &quot;Deep Anarchy.&quot; I regard myself as a Deep
<br>
Anarchist.
<br>
<p>A Deep Anarchist is someone who has examined and radically
<br>
changed certain &quot;systematic patterns of thought&quot; which most
<br>
traditional anarchists take for granted, without question or
<br>
challenge.
<br>
<p>Max More indicates: &quot;Traditional anarchists want to abolish the
<br>
&quot;State.&quot; In planning their strategies and in doing their thinking
<br>
about this they rarely question the existence or fundamental
<br>
nature of their enemy.&quot; For an examination of the &quot;enemy,&quot;
<br>
see #TL07B: The Nature of Government
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07b.shtml">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07b.shtml</a>&gt;.
<br>
<p>If you're interested in becoming one of those who gains &quot;deeper
<br>
understandings&quot; about the &quot;nature of government&quot; and would
<br>
like to help spread them, I invite you to join me on the Deep
<br>
Anarchy Discussion List &lt;<a href="mailto:deep_anarchy-subscribe@topica.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20&quot;Nature%20of%20Government&quot;&In-Reply-To=&lt;4.2.2.20010728111455.00d50430@209.150.150.38&gt;">deep_anarchy-subscribe@topica.com</a>&gt;
