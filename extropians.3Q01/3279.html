</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, one thing I've noticed that is different between the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt;educational system and those of european and other countries that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rate higher is that the US system tends to treat every student
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like they need either a college prep curriculum or else glorified
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nose wiping. Vocational training at the high school level is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;almost non-existent in the US today.
</em><br>
<p>I went to a high school (Lane Tech, Chicago) where &quot;shop&quot; was
<br>
amongst the most popular of all classes, probably because you did
<br>
things that were actually useful. (It's a guy thing too.)
<br>
<p>Our society has so successfully stigmatized the trades that it is
<br>
very difficult to find people to fill these jobs, and contrary to
<br>
social myth, not just anyone will do.
<br>
<p>It is considered very uncool to end up in the trades these days.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There seems to be this prevailing notion in Education university
</em><br>
<em>&gt;departments that 'mainstreaming' is of paramount importance, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;preparing kids for being functional adults isn't, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;providing 'special ed' programs for the low end students is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;important than providing advanced training for smart kids, to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point that AP classes are seen as extraneous, a frivolity seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only in wealth school districts.
</em><br>
<p>Triage, with limited funds you help those most in need first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In recent years, schools have treated 'computer class' as the sole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vocational training worthy of treatment by high schools, as if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there isn't a huge demand for skilled machinists and other trades
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people, and often at the expense of those programs that do remain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in those areas.
</em><br>
<p>These jobs have been stigmatized, trades are where you end up if
<br>
you fail at everything else, nobodies interested....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Educators are focused on 'education' as some catch all suitcase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;term, when they actually ignore, or are completely incompetent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;teach specialized courses, from math and computers to machining,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;carpentry, and auto mechanics. I personally think that 'education'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should only be a minor for college students seeking to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;teachers in grades K-12, that they should have their major in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;real skill area like math, history, or english, etc. Even those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who wish to become university professors in Education should have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a specialty in a real skill area beyond 'education'.
</em><br>
<p>I happen to be reading the late Mortimer Adler on the purpose of
<br>
education right now, so I will respectfully disagree. I agree with
<br>
him that the purpose of an outstanding liberal (in the educational
<br>
sense ;) ) education is to create a truly thinking member of
<br>
society.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Your last statement here is the telling one. As I've said, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;primary problem with educating minorities and other poor kids is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that education, knowledge, etc tends to have little or no respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in their homes. The absence of books from the home is highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indicative of this.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Frankly, I consider any parent with less than 100 books in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;home to be guilty of child neglect. Any parent who thinks that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;books aren't necessary for raising kids is not fit to be a parent.
</em><br>
<p>One of my University professors (Loyola) was a Jesuit who worked in
<br>
education problems of the disadvantaged. He told us the single most
<br>
telling factor was the presence, or lack of, reading material in
<br>
the home.
