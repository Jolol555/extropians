Thank you for your verbose reply!
<br>
<p>&lt;smirk&gt;
<br>
My expectation for participating in this entropy list albeit rather
<br>
passively, is not at variance with the statement &quot; If you go in expecting
<br>
unceasing, stimulating conversation with the world's best intellectuals...&quot;
<br>
<p>&lt;/smirk&gt;

<em>&gt; Speaking as a member of said organization, it's a cost/benefit decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that seems to have different weights for everyone.  For me, the cost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was practically zero - thanks to my parents, I was already in by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time I was old enough to decide if I wished to stay, and further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; membership was a negligible financial cost.  Back during the 'Net
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bubble, I invested some of my excess earnings (which would probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have vanished into nothingness by now if I hadn't used them then) into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a long membership period (either 5 year or life, I forget which).  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits are minor - for instance, an excuse to host one of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events, and a slight authority status in any intellectual debate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone extremely vulnerable to appeals to authority (like, say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weak-willed venture capitalists) - but larger than the cost, so I keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my membership.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For most people I have heard from, the benefits are likely to be minor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and social.  If you go in expecting unceasing, stimulating conversation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the world's best intellectuals, prepare to be dissappointed -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubly so when (and if) you realize that this *is* their normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversation, despite their intelligence.  It's just a random sample of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normal people, differentiated from most human beings only by their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to score highly on a certain type of test (which may or may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have some correlation with ability to learn stuff quickly, and apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any such knowledge already possessed...though not necessarily the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual possession of said knowledge).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is partly from my observations of Mensa that comes my belief that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, even what most people currently regard as &quot;genius&quot; level,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be learned by almost anyone (the sole exception being people with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain classes of brain trauma at a high enough degree that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually unable to function in modern society).  Genetics, and thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns learned as a child, may give some people an edge when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reach adulthood, but any ultimate potential difference that invokes is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far in excess of how good even most &quot;geniuses&quot; really become today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which, in turn, gives hope that a properly written AI may well surpass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual human general intelligence levels, and even be able to upgrade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any uploads...
