<em>&gt; &gt;On Miriam English's point above: the US system is NOT privatized.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;heavily regulated.  In fact, I bet it's the most regulated part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;economy -- unless banking is more regulated than it...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point above (even though it is really only a side issue to my main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point) still stands. You are simply arguing that it is not as privatised
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; it could be. Undoubtedly that is true.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not completely sure about that, but I do know the US system is much less
<br>
free market now then it was four decades ago and even less than it was a
<br>
century ago.  The general trend has been toward more regulation here and
<br>
increasing subsidization.  Both cause costs to rise and this increase in
<br>
cost gives rise to calls for more regulation and subsidization.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I said was that the US health
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market is probably the most privatised in the world. It is also the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive. To get a broken leg fixed in US is way more expensive than in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australia. (Forget drugs -- just basic health care: x-ray, cast,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physiotherapy.) Australia has mostly had a publicly funded health system
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; the past. In recent years politicians who have been mesmerised by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic rationalist religion have been dismantling that and the costs for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health have been rising as a result. One of our states, Queensland, has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always had the most public hospital system in Australia. Health care in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that state is cheap and universal, and the same high quality elsewhere in
</em><br>
Oz.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure about the true costs there.  After all, you might not have to
<br>
pay much directly, but what about indirect costs?  Taxes and the like are
<br>
the main vehicle for payment in Australia, IIRC.  This means your out of
<br>
pocket cost might be low or zero, but the cost is not low or zero.  I've not
<br>
seen any serious analyses of Australia, so I don't know the exact figures.
<br>
Several years ago, when national healthcare was a hot topic here in the US,
<br>
I read up on the Canadian and British examples and saw costs out of control,
<br>
long waits for simple procedures, and the like.
<br>
<p>In the US, there are several ways costs are separate from price.
<br>
Prescription drugs, e.g., makes a third party decide what the consumer
<br>
actually wants.  It's noticeable how when a drug moves from the perscription
<br>
list to the over the counter one the price drops, often to a fraction of its
<br>
prescription price.  (It's also noticeable how drug companies fight to keep
<br>
their drugs on the perscription list.)
<br>
<p>The solution here seems quite obvious.  Abolish prescription drug laws.
<br>
(Also, abolish import restrictions, so that people can legally import the
<br>
drugs they need here.)
<br>
<p>Another example is basic health costs.  Since most people have health
<br>
insurance through their employer, they don't see the full cost of their
<br>
insurance.  (Why people use insurance to fund healthcare is another matter.
<br>
Why, e.g., don't people use car insurance to fund oil changes?  Imagine how
<br>
high car insurance rates would be if they did so?  Imagine, also, if, in
<br>
order to combat the high cost of car insurance, we nationalized it, so that
<br>
national car insurance paid for oil changes?)  Since they do not benefit
<br>
much if at all from holding costs down, many people abuse this employee
<br>
healthcare insurance.  They don't shop around for the lowest costing x-ray,
<br>
perscription drugs, eye glasses, etc.  Or even for the optimum level of
<br>
&quot;insurance.&quot;
<br>
<p>The solution here is also obvious.  Scrap this system, giving the employees
<br>
the money that would normally go to health insurance go to the employee and
<br>
let him or her shop around for health plans.  (Some here have proposed
<br>
medical savings accounts (MSA), to force the employee to put aside money for
<br>
healthcare.  IIRC, the plan is that each employee would have to keep a
<br>
certain amount in the MSA each year and could put more in up to a certain
<br>
limit.  I think after the year is up, the employee can then take the money
<br>
out, meaning that if he or she saved money -- through healthy life style,
<br>
frugality, or luck -- he or she would be able to then spend that.  This
<br>
would give an incentive to not waste healthcare money.)
<br>
<p>That the AMA controls licensing -- that licensing even exists -- also causes
<br>
increasd costs.  The AMA drives up prices through basic legal monopoly
<br>
status in the US.  It can control the number of seats in medical schools and
<br>
the like.
<br>
<p>The solution here is obvious.  Get rid of the AMA's legal priviliges and
<br>
allow real competition in the market for doctors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Health is just one of the things that I believe the capitalist system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manages very badly. It is great for many other things, and in fact it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even good at certain aspects of medicine. But take balance and control out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the health system and it is like cutting the brake lines on a car: it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may get you somewhere very fast but do you really want to be on board when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it gets there?
</em><br>
<p>Not so.  The current US system is mismanaged because of government
<br>
interventions in the market.  Removing these would make it more robust and
<br>
less unstable.  The government does not &quot;balance and control&quot; the system.
<br>
Instead, it makes it less stable, as seen from the rising costs of
<br>
healthcare since the introduction of Medicaid and Medicare.  Regulations and
<br>
subsidies like Medicare only destabilize the market.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Please understand: I am not anti-capitalist. I'm not socialist, communist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalist, marxist... The thing that most closely describes my position
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; anarchist, but I am not really even that.
</em><br>
<p>Then how does that part of you that is close to anarchist embrace government
<br>
regulation of individuals?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think any one system has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the answers. Human society is way too complex and humans too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpredictable and too prone to do irrational things. It is very attractive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to look for a simple answer to complicated questions, but maybe some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex questions just don't have simple, clean answers.
</em><br>
<p>All the more reason not to use force in voluntary interactions.  How can a
<br>
bureaucrat or a politician somehow be better able to decide these things
<br>
than the people themselves?  Individuals have an interest in their own lives
<br>
well beyond any other persons.  They also have the information -- even if
<br>
they sometimes use it unwisely -- that bureacrats and politicians don't
<br>
have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I actually think capitalism is a very cool way to accomplish many things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I also recognise it is bad at some things. To ignore its failures and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excesses is risky.
</em><br>
<p>My point here is not to make the free market out to be perfect, but to show
<br>
how some particular social problem is not really cause by market failure,
<br>
but by government interference.
<br>
<p>Also, in most cases of so called market failure, people are usually
<br>
confusing a regulated market  with a free one.  If a regulated market causes
<br>
problem, one should not immediately call for more regulation or outright
<br>
socialization, but examine how the regulation has affected the market.  One
<br>
might then see, that in many cases, that regulation is the cause of the
<br>
failure.
<br>
<p>As for risk, each person has their own level of risk.  Generally, however,
<br>
regulation and even socialization redistribute risks, so that those who take
<br>
them do not experience the full cost of the risk.  For example, deposit
<br>
insurance in banking -- pretty much a worldwide phenomena -- causes banks to
<br>
take excessive risks.  Why?  All banks are guaranteed not to fail.  So, bank
<br>
customers have little need to be picky and banks themselves take more risks
<br>
than they would without the insurance.  Hence further regulations to make
<br>
sure banks don't invest in certain markets or keep a certain level of
<br>
reserve.  (See Kevin Dowd's _Laissez-Faire Banking_ and George A. Selgin's
<br>
_The Theory of Free Banking: Money Supply under Competitive Note Issue_.  In
<br>
his book, Dowd actually comes out with a concrete plan to abolish government
<br>
deposit insurance over a five year period, to prevent disruption.)
<br>
<p>I'm only using the banking example because I'm most familiar with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think an economy should be seen as an ecology where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many systems fill particular niches and work as controls on each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Remember that when one highly efficient plant dominates an ecology we call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it a weed.  :-)
</em><br>
<p>If you see the economy as an ecosystem, then government interference in it
<br>
is like strip mining.  Why would you not, also, see the government as a
<br>
weed, since governments tend to dominate their economies, through all sorts
<br>
of controls.  It seems your analogy actually works against your convictions.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
