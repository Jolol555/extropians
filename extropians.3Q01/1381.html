<p>Ask Samantha Atkins - she thinks you're allowed to say things like that,
<br>
she should have to handle the response.  &lt;smile&gt;
<br>
<p>Okay, just kidding.  Actually, there are several things you can say to
<br>
someone who says &quot;We should have a deep respect for life in all its forms
<br>
and manifestations&quot;.  I can guess what Samantha Atkins would say:
<br>
<p>&quot;Creating a stem cell embryo for the specific purpose of curing Parkinsons
<br>
need not involve disrespect for the embryo, nor especially the human
<br>
cured; a stem cell embryo has a high purpose, just not the usual high
<br>
purpose.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;An embryo has the potential to develop into a human being *or* to cure a
<br>
different human being of Parkinsons.  Until it develops into a fetus, it
<br>
hasn't been irrevocably committed to the destiny of being a human, and can
<br>
have other purposes that are just as beautiful.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would say:
<br>
<p>&quot;I think that calling for 'a deep respect for life in all its forms' is a
<br>
high-sounding but empty statement that dodges all the real moral issues. 
<br>
You don't say what 'disrespect' is, or why, or explain how disrespect is
<br>
the proper subject of government legislation; you simply look at a new
<br>
technology, experience future shock, say 'eeeww', and regard this as
<br>
sufficient cause to ban medical research that could save thousands of
<br>
lives.  Whether using a stem cell embryo to cure Parkinsons is
<br>
'disrespectful', i.e., 'morally unacceptable', is not a take-home issue;
<br>
it is the whole of the argument.  Every advance in medical technology,
<br>
from smallpox vaccines to pacemakers, seems strange to someone.  This
<br>
doesn't prove that 'disrespect' is a nonissue, but it does demonstrate
<br>
that it takes more to establish moral horror than someone saying 'eeeww'. 
<br>
Myself, I don't think a stem cell embryo is a human being any more than an
<br>
unfertilized egg cell is a human being or a two-by-four is a finished
<br>
house.  I don't see how a stem cell embryo could possibly count as a
<br>
sentient being when it takes until the second trimester of pregnancy for a
<br>
fetus's neurons to even begin forming synapses.  I understand that some
<br>
people may feel differently, but I don't think that feeling has enough
<br>
basis in fact to direct the course of medical research.&quot;
