<p>Tough fuckin' titty. It's time to keep a steady eye on the Emperor's

wardrobe, warts and all. The WO(s)D can't be won in a humanitarian

way without treating users and peasant producers like human beings.
<br>
This of course is indecipherable to primitive thinkers as anything
<br>
but their worst nightmare. They need to be told that they are wrong.

Loudly, and often. There is no better time than now.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Non-religious theist&quot; or plain &quot;theist&quot; don't sound right either,

<p>Well, try THIS on for size: I might mean that if we are living in
<br>
a simulation, I am hopeful that we have a piece of the puzzle which was 
<br>
set for us, and that reality will reflect this in time. And that we'll
<br>
be &quot;played out with music&quot; at the end.
<br>
<p>Speaking only for myself:
<br>
I'm still an agnostic, and I still talk about God as shorthand.
<br>
If that trips someone's Big Hairy Sky Thunderer buttons, it's
<br>
not my problem. You are welcome to think of it as an endearing 
<br>
eccentricity. Paging Humpty Dumpty...
