</em><br>
<p>I think we can agree that memetic warfare happens all the time, so we
<br>
need a new term, maybe 'strategic memetic warfare' or something to
<br>
indicate an action deliberately planned to use memetic warfare concepts
<br>
and techniques.
<br>
<p>And who better at it than marketing people? From reading Douglas
<br>
Rushkoff's _Coercion: Why We Listen to What &quot;They&quot; Say_, I think there's
<br>
a definite use for the folks that have taken a few millenia of noble
<br>
human pan-cultural progress in hosting and gift-giving traditions and
<br>
then destroyed it all in a century of scientifically applied marketing.
<br>
Send 'em over there in vast quantities to make new advertising campaigns
<br>
that trivialize and commoditize islam. &quot;We're announcing a fatwa against
<br>
high prices! It's a jihad of savings!!!&quot; Bribe the folks who sing the
<br>
call to prayer to insert product pitches. How that would sound is left
<br>
up to the reader's imagination.
<br>
<p>If you've seen the 'Behind the Veil' documentary on CNN, there's a scene
<br>
where women are buying scraps of moldy bread, ostensibly sold as animal
<br>
feed, which they then ground up to feed their starving children. You or
<br>
I might look at that, and have feelings of sympathy for their plight and
<br>
possibly be moved to take some action, contribute to the red cross or
<br>
whatever. Whereas a good television commercial producer would
<br>
immediately recognize they broke the rules: food is always shown in
<br>
motion. Pan the camera rapidly around the pile of scraps. It looks much
<br>
much better that way. With good-looking dancing afghanis all around,
<br>
munching, chatting, laughing. And they'd want a very well-lit, slightly
<br>
slo-mo closeup of a crust snap (with tiny bread particles flying) to
<br>
emphasize its crunchability. There's a use for people who think like
<br>
that. And now's the time the country needs them. 
<br>
<p>We'd put on a big patriotic sendoff, with speeches and flags and
<br>
fireworks and jet flybys, as the marketeers board ships and airplanes
<br>
for islamic hotspots. If (just by slim chance) the natives' reaction is
<br>
to kill them all in a bloody killing frenzy, well, that would be really
<br>
sad, now wouldn't it ... Yup. It'd be sad all right. Really. Really sad.
