<em>&gt; The essentialism/antiessentialism debate revolves around what an object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is. Is it the actual thing or is it a linguistic object and hence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract and conceptual? I think it is a fascinating debate. Realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when humans talk about the sun, moon, and starts there are no such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things in a person's head. The cranium just isn't large enough. Words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must stand for and represent supposed objects. What we do then is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentally assemble objects together.
</em><br>
<p>This does not follow.  There is no need for the actual objects
<br>
rather than perceptions and concepts of them, to be in our head
<br>
in order for actual objects to exist in the world outside our
<br>
heads.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Givens however, can be questioned infinitely, qualified and requalified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again and again. How far is established not by the essential nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the given, but by the perseverance and will of the analyst, and at what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point he feels satisfied. That is a valuation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So, you think base level axioms (irreducible givens) are just a
<br>
matter of feeling?  In short that they are wholly subjective?
<br>
<p>Sorry, but I really have limited time and patience for this kind
<br>
of pseudo-philosophical treatment.
