<p>And now you can be indoctrinated by the religion of Scientism,
<br>
Extropianism being the particular denomination. With your background you
<br>
should be able to analyze all this in terms of dogmas (by other names like
<br>
scientific premises or givens), catechism (religious questions and
<br>
answers) and even religious holydays like Galileo Day. The eternal
<br>
verities of Scientism are now offered in replacement for the eternal
<br>
verities of Mormonism, Roman Catholicism or whatever. 
<br>
<p>Yesterday I sent a lengthy backgrounder on the Bush faith-based
<br>
initiatives. If the adherents of Extropianism have such strong faith in
<br>
this being a better religion than the traditional ones they should apply
<br>
for faith-based grants. You can get that backgrounder from the
<br>
Life-Gazette archives if you want to prepare for a faith-based initiative.
