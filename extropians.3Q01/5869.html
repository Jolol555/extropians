<p>
A family of relatively recent Indian immigrants who are merchants in our
<br>
neighbrohood have a 10-year-old son who seems to be shaping up to be a math
<br>
and science prodigy.  He came in 5th place last year in the state math
<br>
competition and his development in these areas appears to be accelerating
<br>
under the enthusiastic support of his proud parents and teachers.  His
<br>
father confided in me this afternoon, though, that the boy is lagging in his
<br>
reading skills: He's bored with what he's given to read at school and, while
<br>
his parents are very fine people, they have only a modest education and are
<br>
at a loss for what to suggest he read.  When I proposed that we might try to
<br>
interest him in some science fiction, his father's eyes lit up and he
<br>
responded that it was a &quot;splendid&quot; idea.
<br>
<p>Here's the only problem: I don't know what to suggest for a super-bright
<br>
10-year-old in 2001.  I was cutting my teeth on RAH's and Bradbury's (the
<br>
other one)juveniles at that time and fairly quickly graduated to His Most
<br>
Blessed Insightfulness, the Serene Maestro of Serendip.  What's good these
<br>
days?
