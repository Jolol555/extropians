<em>&gt; Can anyone confirm what one discussant on our BCPOLITICS list said last

<em>&gt; year...That slavery in the US is not illegal, even today?
</em><br>
<p>The 14th amendment does outlaw both slavery and peony. What they may
<br>
claim is that this only applies on federal property, which is untrue,
<br>
since the 14th specifically compells the states to comply with the Bill
<br>
of Rights for all US citizens. The original Emancipation Proclaimation
<br>
only freed the slaves within the states that seceded. Those in states
<br>
that remained in the Union were never freed by this proclaimation, but
<br>
only when the 14th Amendment was enacted and ratified.
<br>
<p>Now, there is some debate about the ratification of the 14th Amendment.
<br>
For example, the rebel states were only allowed back into the union if
<br>
they ratified the as yet unratified 14th amendment (i.e. the union
<br>
didn't have 2/3 of the states ratify the amendment by that point), so
<br>
they essentially forced its ratification upon the people of the south if
<br>
they wanted to regain their own rights of representation. It can be
<br>
said, therefore, that as this is a contract signed under threat of
<br>
force, it has no legal weight.
<br>
<p>Another point of contention is that there is a significant difference of
<br>
sovereignty of a natural citizen versus a person naturalized under the
<br>
14th Amendment, where a natural citizen posesses their rights as a
<br>
default, with the Constitution recognizing their preexisting rights,
<br>
while those that gained their rights under the 14th amendment were only
<br>
given their rights by the government, that they did not posess them
<br>
originally, naturally. I personally don't buy this, but it is, in fact,
<br>
how the 14th amendment was written that is the problem. Rather than
<br>
admit that the blacks posessed rights all along on a natural basis (and
<br>
therefore making whites at fault for their abrogation), the feds
<br>
smoothed it over by 'giving' black slaves their 'rights', as if the
<br>
federal government even has the power to do so, which propagates the
<br>
claims of white supremacists that blacks did not posess their rights
<br>
naturally.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Lee, dearest, do you remember just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; couple of days ago, when you were telling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; me that &quot;It really would be best for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; concerned to avoid personal references
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; like this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Olga, can you believe that I wasn't, really,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; really, really, wasn't referring to you???
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You also wrote about the importance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;confin[ing] oneself to careful argument.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; And you didn't do that, either.  Dear,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; oh dear - what am I going to do with you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ah, but I did.  You (for some unknown reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; took personally what clearly did not apply to

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It's usually put forth as the reason that the

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Civil War was fought, &quot;to free the slaves&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Abraham Lincoln is probably best known &quot;for

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; weren't here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What I meant, was literal (as usual).  Namely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that although you undoubtedly learned the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; historical facts a long time ago (or have done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a very good job recently), you perhaps didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understand that everyone learns about Abraham
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Lincoln in elementary school here.  And in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; middle school. And in high school.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You probably thought that this was yet another

<em>&gt; &gt; slam:  that I was implying (I am not) that you
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If Thomas Sowell says that racism doesn't exist in the U.S.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; he's lying ... if that's what he says ...).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; By no means does he say such a thing!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Lee, I didn't say Sowell says such a thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But it's customary to clear any innocent third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; party's name in these discussions.  To make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; **perfectly** clear to any other reader the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; true nature of some prominent person's views.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; That's why I wrote the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;IF&quot; up there a couple of times.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Don't be so sensitive.  Again, you were reading

<em>&gt; &gt; implications where they did not belong.  I know
