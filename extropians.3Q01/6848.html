Not me, but I have a namesake travelling in Afghanistan at the moment

<p>Monday September 17, 2001
<br>
<p><p>As American Airlines flight 11 ploughed into the World Trade Centre, I was
<br>
sitting with a group of young Taliban in Jalalabad, eastern Afghanistan. I
<br>
had just arrived on a tourist visa and was thoroughly enjoying myself. It
<br>
was 5.30pm and we were watching the local gymnastics club practise beside
<br>
the Kabul river. In the light of the setting sun, the boys rehearsed their
<br>
flips and rolls, a thin mat their only piece of equipment.
<br>
<p>Afterwards the Taliban lads took me to a stall, bought me some chips and
<br>
Coke, and bombarded me with questions. Which country was I from? Why was I
<br>
in Afghanistan? Could I help them get an English visa? Like most Afghans,
<br>
they initially appeared stern and forbidding, but when I greeted them and
<br>
held out my hand they melted into smiles.
<br>
<p>On Wednesday morning I took a taxi to Kabul, still completely unaware of
<br>
events in New York and Washington. We were pulled over at the first
<br>
checkpoint outside Jalalabad by a group of black-turbaned Taliban sporting
<br>
AK47s and batons. I opened my bum bag but the guard wasn't interested in
<br>
seeing my passport or visa. He reached in and pulled out a couple of
<br>
&quot;un-Islamic&quot; family photos, examined them carefully, smiled and put them
<br>
back.
<br>
<p>The driver wasn't so lucky. The Taliban found an illegal music cassette in
<br>
the glove box and hauled him out, whacked him around the head and took him
<br>
away for questioning. They politely apologised to me for the delay and found
<br>
me another taxi. Judging by the streams of tape flying from a lamp-post, it
<br>
was business as usual.
<br>
<p>It was a dusty and incredibly bumpy journey to Kabul, along roads whose
<br>
tarmac had been destroyed by tank treads and missile attacks. We passed
<br>
ruined villages, abandoned Soviet tanks and fenced-off areas awaiting the
<br>
mine clearance teams. But among the relics of carnage there were moments of
<br>
rare beauty. Nomads led camel trains and flocks of goats across the desert.
<br>
Unveiled girls in bright pink tunics gathered water from a turquoise river
<br>
and balanced bundles on their heads while eagles soared above.
<br>
<p>I first heard the news in a Kabul hotel from Gulbudin, a middle-aged Afghan
<br>
with a short-wave radio. &quot;Do you know someone has flown an aeroplane into
<br>
the World Trade Centre in America?&quot; This was so preposterous that I didn't
<br>
take him seriously, so I headed out to explore the city and see if anyone
<br>
could confirm his story.
<br>
<p>In the handicraft shops of Chicken Street, the desperate shopkeepers were
<br>
more interested in selling me jewellery and carpets. But, when pressed, one
<br>
told me: &quot;Terrorists have destroyed a big business building in America. We
<br>
saw it on the dish. Yes, we have television, it's easy to hide.&quot;
<br>
<p>I went to a restaurant for dinner and the atmosphere was more sombre. Three
<br>
old men were listening intently to the BBC World Service news in Pashto. The
<br>
only words I could understand were &quot;Osama bin Laden&quot; and &quot;Taliban&quot;, and it
<br>
began to dawn on me. I was in the worst country in the world to be a
<br>
westerner.
<br>
<p>Back at the hotel, I tried to find Gulbudin but was gently marched upstairs
<br>
by a young Talib. My paranoia was working overtime, but he just sat me down,
<br>
gave me a cup of tea and tried to convert me to Islam before asking me, with
<br>
real bemusement in his voice, why the west hate the Taliban. Once I escaped
<br>
his passionate sermons, I found Gulbudin and his radio, and finally heard
<br>
the news in full and shocking detail.
<br>
<p>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; said Gulbudin. &quot;You are safe here. You are a guest in our
<br>
country and we Afghans will do nothing to harm you.&quot; Nevertheless, on
<br>
Thursday morning I went to the Red Cross office, where Mario, the
<br>
information officer, told me to get out immediately. All the other aid
<br>
workers had already left Kabul and there was a real risk that the border
<br>
would close. &quot;In a city centre hotel you are vulnerable to missile attack,
<br>
but also the Taliban will know where you are in case they carry out
<br>
reprisals,&quot; Mario said. In 1998, after the cruise missile raids, a UN worker
<br>
was shot. There was no decision to make.
<br>
<p>I walked back through a bustling Kabul, sad that I had to leave this ruined
<br>
yet vibrant city. The bazaar was thronged with people buying half-rotten
<br>
vegetables and cheap imported goods. On a stall selling western castoffs was
<br>
a T-shirt advertising McDonald's and another declaring &quot;Nothing ever
<br>
changes&quot;.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is time for you to leave,&quot; Gulbudin said when I met him at the hotel. He
<br>
found me a taxi and told the driver to take me to the border as quickly as
<br>
possible. &quot;Don't worry about the Taliban; they are scared of an American
<br>
attack and won't bother you. Now I will go to my village, where it will be
<br>
quieter.&quot; He gave me a hug and I got into the taxi.
<br>
<p>Driving through the brown, bombed-out suburbs, I saw a tank belching out
<br>
dirty fumes, heading towards the city centre, followed a little later by a
<br>
pick-up truck carrying Taliban troops and their shoulder-held grenade
<br>
launchers.
<br>
<p>I had a nervous wait at the first checkpoint outside Kabul as my driver went
<br>
inside to get permission to continue. I looked past the children selling
<br>
cups of water towards a group of Taliban sitting and fiddling with their
<br>
Kalashnikovs and wondered if I was about to be taken hostage and used as a
<br>
human shield. The driver returned with a few crumpled slips of paper that he
<br>
handed to the guard, and we were off.
<br>
<p>For five uneventful hours we drove past the results of the last superpower
<br>
bombardment, but I didn't relax until we reached the border at Torkham. I
<br>
pushed through the crowds of Afghans, holding my passport above my head to
<br>
alert the Pakistani border police, who were lashing out at the crowd with
<br>
pieces of plastic tubing. They shoved an old woman out of the way, grabbed
<br>
me by the arm and pulled me back into the safety of Pakistan.
