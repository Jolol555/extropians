As a past member of the commercial nuclear community (25 years in the
<br>
operations side) I can see nothing inherently unsafe about the &quot;old&quot; nuclear
<br>
design. I am speaking specifically about the CE designed plants. I see no
<br>
reason for a boiling water reactor design and in fact consider them dirty.
<br>
The question of spent fuel is a failure of government to come through on its
<br>
promise and forcing the industry to throw away 35 percent of its useable
<br>
fuel. There is no &quot;dreaded melt down scenario&quot; outside the mind of hollywood
<br>
and those who would rather not see nuclear power at all - see the 70 percent
<br>
meltdown of TMI, it was a financial and pr disaster but a public health non
<br>
event.

<p><em>&gt; I have been told the new generation of nuclear power plant is vastly safer
</em><br>
then its predecessor.  And this time around we don't have to worry about the
<br>
dreaded &quot;meltdown&quot; scenario.  I stil am concerned about the waste disposal
<br>
issue though.
