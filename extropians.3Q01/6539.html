<p>Lets try to stop the handwaving here.  I tried to do this to some
<br>
extent with my &quot;EXTROPIAN MORALITY&quot; thread but am not sure that it
<br>
went anywhere (perhaps in part because we are dealing with very
<br>
complex issues).
<br>
<p>I pointed out to Helen in the paper that she sent me asking for
<br>
a review of my comments, that there are problems with suggesting
<br>
&quot;relgion&quot; as something that extropians are in some way against.
<br>
Extropians are not against religions.  Extropians are against
<br>
irrationality that results in a loss of information.  Extropians
<br>
are against blind beliefs that are unwilling to subject themselves
<br>
to rational examination and analysis.  Though those perspectives
<br>
may correlate with religions they should not be confused with them.
<br>
There may be religions that provide very useful (extropic) moral
<br>
frameworks that do not resort to hand waving and mumbo jumbo
<br>
(it would be useful for list members to research this I think).
<br>
<p>I view &quot;intelligence&quot; (in terms of ability to hold, manipulate
<br>
and make creative discoveries with large quantities of information)
<br>
as something in a distinct realm separate from religions or moral
<br>
prioritization systems.  I know of an individual who went through
<br>
MIT as a physics major with a 4.0 GPA -- a person much smarter
<br>
than myself -- who maintained a very deep Christian perspective
<br>
of life.  Intelligence and religion are two very very different realms.
<br>
Intelligence is about how much information one can manipulate.
<br>
Religion is, to some extent, about the value you place on the
<br>
information being manipulated.
<br>
<p>The perspective that we need to develop, that I think may be lacking,
<br>
is &quot;What is *really* valuable?&quot;.  Increasing the number of raw
<br>
bits is of course wonderful -- but how do we evaluatate the value
<br>
of those bits?  Sooner or later we are going to hit the limits of
<br>
computational and data storage resources.  When that happens what
<br>
do you save and what do you erase?
<br>
<p>What we are observing with the Moslem Jihads is a perspective that
<br>
&quot;your bits are worthless&quot;.  And from within the perspective of that
<br>
system, that may be an entirely valid belief.  However it is not
<br>
clear to me that the Western perspective of democracies or societies
<br>
&quot;free to believe in a variety of moral systems&quot; can claim the high
<br>
ground.  In watching the ceremonies at Washington National Cathedral
<br>
today, I was struck by the fact that all of the speakers were
<br>
calling on God in one way or another.  While I had tears in my eyes
<br>
with regard to the losses being discussed, I could not help but observe
<br>
the degree to which even a free, rational society is invoking icons
<br>
and histories which are as dubious as those on which Moslem perspectives
<br>
are based.
<br>
<p>My perspective is this -- Can we construct a society and moral
<br>
value system based on &quot;reality&quot;?  I think it is essential that
<br>
we really, seriously begin to ask ourselves *and others* the question:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How do you *know* what you know?&quot;
<br>
Every morning when I get out of bed I extend my feet over the
<br>
edge and I observe whether or not they are accelerated towards the
<br>
floor of my bedroom.  So far, they always have been and thus I am
<br>
confident that the physical law of gravity is still working.  However
<br>
I am keenly aware that many of the things that I believe depend on
<br>
the trust relationships that I have with researchers and scientists
<br>
that I may only know on the basis of reputation.  In reality, I must
<br>
admit only a &quot;hope&quot; that the supersymmetry theory of physical particles is
<br>
valid.  This is not so much different from the faith that the terrorists
<br>
who got on the planes Tuesday have in their perspectives.
<br>
<p>How do we know what we know?
<br>
How do we value one collection of bits above another?
<br>
<p>Those are questions that Extropians must engage and wrestle with.
<br>
