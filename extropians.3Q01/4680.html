<p>It was different between different nations, but many of the eugenics

proponents did lobby for various government initiatives that in many
<br>
cases amounted to force. The sterilization programs in the US and
<br>
various european nations were one result, for example. In general the
<br>
memeset said &quot;we got this huge problem we need to solve fast&quot;, and given
<br>
the control-centric thinking at that time even the most liberal eugenics
<br>
promoter was (perhaps inadvertently) promoting dangerous initiatives.

<p>Would you allow immigration? Think about it. And how do you make sure
<br>
people with &lt; 100 IQ don't cheat on the tests to get lower scores? 
<br>
<p>Seriously, the idea is of course rather pointless because the
<br>
heritability of intelligence is not that strong and the generation time
<br>
of humans is long, so when you would get your genetic change outside
<br>
factors such as intelligence amplification would likely be far larger
<br>
than any genetic benefits. Not to mention the issues whether high IQ
<br>
really helps a nation better than free trade or an open society. 
<br>
<p>Not to mention the ethical problems with a government using tax money to
<br>
reward lack of intelligence.
