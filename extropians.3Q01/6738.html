</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Let me begin by saying that I am attempting to describe things from the
<br>
point of view of the leaders of the US. Barring something like global
<br>
nuclear war, I personally could probably weather a total interruption of oil
<br>
production. I live in a remote area, have photovoltaic panels that provide
<br>
for my basic electrical appliances, including water pump; I have my own
<br>
source of water (rainwater cisterns and pond); I am capable of growing
<br>
enough food to keep myself alive without the use of synthetic fertilizer or
<br>
pesticides, and I'm accustomed to living a rather rugged lifestyle. But for
<br>
most people in the US and other &quot;first world&quot; countries, even a 10%
<br>
reduction in oil production would be disastrous.
<br>
<p>Maybe this will help explain why. Excerpts from PBS Online News Hour
<br>
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/september96/iraq_oil_9-5.html">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/september96/iraq_oil_9-5.html</a>
<br>
<p>============================
<br>
<p><p>Two-thirds of the world's oil is in the Middle East. Though the US buys
<br>
relatively little, an interdependent world economy means the Iraqi conflict
<br>
could directly, and indirectly, hurt us. Charles Krause provides a
<br>
backgrounder, followed by a discussion with Elizabeth Farnsworth and
<br>
strategic experts.
<br>
<p>ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH: Now for our discussion we turn to John Lichtblau,
<br>
chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, an industry-funded
<br>
group that attracts domestic and international petroleum economics. Jessica
<br>
Mathews is senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and Chris
<br>
Flavin, senior vice president of Research at the World Watch Institute and
<br>
Environmental Research Group. Thank you all for being with us. And starting
<br>
with you, Mr. Lichtblau, just how dependent are we on Middle East oil?
<br>
<p>JOHN LICHTBLAU, Petroleum Research Foundation: (New York) Well, not very
<br>
dependent. About less than 20 percent of our imports come from the Middle
<br>
East. And since only about half of our oil is imported, our dependency on
<br>
Middle East oil, overall, is about 8 or 9 percent, which is not very high,
<br>
but it's quite irrelevant how high our dependence is on Middle East oil.
<br>
<p>It's the total oil import dependency that counts because there's only one
<br>
world oil market, and whether we buy oil from the Middle East or from South
<br>
America or from Africa, if there's any problem in any of these supply areas,
<br>
it affects the price everywhere. So if we were to shift our oil imports more
<br>
even than we've done from the Middle East to other areas, it would in no way
<br>
make our oil supplies more secure.
<br>
<p>ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH: Mr. Flavin, are we countering, as some people say,
<br>
Saddam Hussein because of oil?
<br>
<p>CHRIS FLAVIN, Worldwatch Institute: Saddam Hussein has us over a barrel in
<br>
the Middle East, and he knows it, and we know it, and that's why we have
<br>
such an extraordinary military commitment to that region.
<br>
<p>I mean, as John indicated, it's really the world oil market as a whole we
<br>
need to be concerned about. Japan gets about 2/3 of its oil from the Middle
<br>
East. Our allies in Europe get a much larger share of their oil from the
<br>
Middle East. And so we as a group of industrialized countries, the whole
<br>
global economy really now is terribly dependent on the Middle East. And
<br>
now--
<br>
<p>ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH: Let me just interrupt you here one minute. So the fact
<br>
that we get less than 20 percent from the Middle East does not mean that we'
<br>
re not dependent?
<br>
<p>MR. FLAVIN: The key figure is that 2/3 of the world's proven oil reserves
<br>
are in the Middle East. We're all dependent there, and because we have now a
<br>
rapidly growing oil demand in China and other Asian countries, we're really
<br>
looking at a rather dangerous situation as the next decade unfolds.
<br>
<p><p><p>ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH Or, let's put it this way. Does oil explain U.S. policy
<br>
in the Middle East in your view?
<br>
<p>MS. MATHEWS: No. I mean, you know, if the Middle East grew bananas, then it
<br>
would be a different thing, and we wouldn't have the strategic interest that
<br>
we have there, but over the years we've acquired a set of strategic
<br>
interests that are much broader. And we have a history now of Saddam Hussein
<br>
that has now--that is about more than oil. It's about our position in the
<br>
world, and it's about our values versus his, and our word versus his.
<br>
<p>We have a relationship with Israel. We have long-term concerns about Iran.
<br>
Now they're related to oil in that that's where the wealth comes from. But
<br>
they are--if you reverse it and say if we only needed to import 2 percent of
<br>
our oil or 0 percent almost, could we leave? The answer is no.
<br>
<p>ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH: What do you think, Mr. Lichtblau?
<br>
<p>MR. LICHTBLAU: I think this is correct. It's not our import of oil that
<br>
matters. It's the fact that, as has been said many times, 2/3 of the world's
<br>
oil reserves are located there, and that is irreversible and permanent.
<br>
About 50 percent of world oil exports come from the Middle East to, to all
<br>
these companies, Europe, Latin--South Asia, the U.S. and so on, and we just
<br>
have to defend this area because it contains for whatever reason this kind
<br>
of volume of oil.
<br>
<p>========================
<br>
<p><em> &gt;The US hasn't used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Israel as a base from which to attack countries that refuse to sell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or raise the price of oil.  Is there an implicit threat to do so?
</em><br>
<p>Of course there is, although it's not usually stated in the terms you've
<br>
used. That's what maintaining a military presence is all about. Look at it
<br>
on a smaller scale. When you hire uniformed security guards to watch your
<br>
warehouse at night, your expectation is that his or her mere presence will
<br>
deter burglars.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If so, why didn't we when OPEC was strong, or during the gulf war?
</em><br>
<p>When you say &quot;when OPEC was strong,&quot; I assume you mean in the 1970's. I
<br>
can't answer your questions about why the US government did what they did
<br>
except to say that a military attack would have been used only as a last
<br>
resort. OPEC, incidentally, was modeled on the Texas Railroad Commission,
<br>
which has controlled the production of oil in Texas since the late 1930's. I
<br>
personally think it's a very good idea to control the production of oil.
<br>
What was happening in Texas during the 30's was that owners of neighboring
<br>
tracts of land were competing to see who could suck up more oil faster, and
<br>
the price of oil fell to ridiculously low levels. I think it would have been
<br>
a good idea to slow production even more than was done in the and keep
<br>
prices higher. It would have encouraged the development of alternative
<br>
energy sources, and possibly prevented us from being in our present
<br>
predicament. The reason OPEC's interruption of oil production caused
<br>
problems in the 1970's was that US economy was already addicted to cheap oil
<br>
at the time.
<br>
<p>With respect to the Gulf War's relevance to preserving Israel -- the point
<br>
is not that Israel is the ONLY possible staging area. As you've probably
<br>
noted, US is now discussing using Pakistan for access to Afghanistan. The
<br>
point is that Israel is reliable--that is, it can be depended on *under any
<br>
and all circumstances*.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Israel isn't even all that close the main oil fields.  Jordan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a bunch of desert lies between.  The Persian Gulf offers much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better access should the US wish to force producers to sell at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price we set.
</em><br>
<p>Israel is the only *reliable* ally in the region.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; oil is the objective, it'd be simpler to pay off/befriend Saudi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Arabia and Kuwait than to ally with Israel.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, it would be simpler if everyone would be friendly with everyone else.
<br>
But things don't always work out like that in real life.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Not a problem.  They don't all have to be friendly at the same time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd guess among Persian Gulf area oil producers, Kuwait is currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most friendly to the US, Iraq the least.  Doesn't matter if that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets shuffled.  It's all oil.
</em><br>
<p>Review the history of the oil crisis of the 1970's. Here's a good site:
<br>
<a href="http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/history/rtg/oilcrisis/legenda.htm">http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/history/rtg/oilcrisis/legenda.htm</a>
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Israel is able to defend itself quite nicely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't believe it's ever had to defend itself without US support.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They've mostly managed on their own.
</em><br>
<p>See my reply to Alejandro. Israel has always had aid from the US.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What has the US provided
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apart from money and intelligence?
</em><br>
<p>Huh? Don't understand what point you're trying to make.
