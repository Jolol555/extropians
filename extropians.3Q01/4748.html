<em>&gt; &gt;Even in those days, the poorest who dropped out of school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;typically did so with an education gained by the 6th grade that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;roughly equivalent to the sort of education our teachers impart to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;our kids today by the 12th grade. Nor do those who are destined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;for non-degree jobs need to be able to quote Dostoyevsky or Homer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;One of the big problems with education today is that vocational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;training has been removed from many high schools, it is treated as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a post-secondary educational course, when prior to public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;education, kids could drop out of high school with more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;skills as machinists or draftsmen than many vocational graduates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;today. Not every kid needs a college prep education, but teachers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;seem to think they do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm going to disagree with you on this and side with Mortimer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Adler.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The purpose of a true liberal (in the educational sense) education
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to create a citizen fit to live in a democracy. I oppose the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion of a lesser education thereby deliberately creating an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underclass.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I expect to change your mind with one question: If a liberal
<br>
education is to make a citizen fit to live in a democracy, why is it
<br>
that there are more citizens than ever who are completely UNFIT to live
<br>
in a democracy, and it is ENTIRELY the fault of the educational system?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And non-degree jobs are scarce and getting scarcer.
</em><br>
<p>Skilled non-degree jobs go begging to be filled, machinists being just
<br>
the easiest to point to.
