<em>&gt;This Rael has over 55,000 members who are expected to give 3% of their

<p>What if it did?  What would E5 have been like?  There would have been
<br>
several thousand extropians in San Jose, the whole thing would have been
<br>
like a Linux convention, with Max as Linus.  We woulda been lost in
<br>
a sea of people we don't know and couldnt really get to know, looking
<br>
for the few familiar faces.  We woulda just been overwhelmed.
<br>
<p>Extropians may eventually grow into something like scores of thousands
<br>
of members, with thousands of yahoos logging on daily to argue trivial
<br>
points, endless fracturing into subgroups, etc.  If it does, we may fondly
<br>
remember and miss these days when the movement was small and intimate.
