<p>Whatever makes you happy. Me, I am counting slowly backwards from
<br>
one hundred and reminding myself of the subject line I wrote:
<br>
&quot;choosing one's fights.&quot; :) If nontheists were being stoned to death
<br>
in the streets of the US, I might deserve your label. I haven't seen
<br>
that happening. Must be that goshdarned theistic press controlled by
<br>
that theistic power elite suppressing the truth, huh?
<br>
<p>I repeat that I think a sheaf of strategies is useful; if you don't,
<br>
that's human, and I can deal. Doctrinaire *anything* makes my skin itch.
