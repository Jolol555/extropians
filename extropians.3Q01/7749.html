Yes and no.
<br>
<p>In terms of terminal ballistic effect, .30-06 would be an OK choice, 
<br>
as would .308; many of the flatter-shooting (fast) varmint rounds ought
<br>
to be &quot;better&quot; across a wider bracket of ranges, I think.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Close up, 12-gauge slugs are also a possibility. 
<br>
<p>Ag-Cats and such are very tough, but the cockpits are not generally armored.
<br>
Not clear if the baddies would kevlar or spectra their seats; such armor is 
<br>
available as flat sheets, few-questions-asked from some domestic sources. 
<br>
Fuel tanks are of course a big win *if* you manage to strike some nice 
<br>
sparks; no guarantees you will without specialty ammo. Tracers, for instance, 
<br>
are illegal in CA.
<br>
<p>If the baddie is flying nap-of-earth you might not have a hell of a
<br>
lot of time to react, e.g. by the time you get out of your house with
<br>
your squirrel rifle, he's in the next section.
<br>
<p>Two complicating factors: proper leading takes *much* practice;
<br>
and the non-horizontal aimpoint means you will tend to shoot higher
<br>
than your sight picture (this happens to be true whether you are
<br>
shooting down or up, rather counterintuitively). I'm not ready to
<br>
do this sort of thing today.
<br>
<p>Given the above, n guys with .223s might be a better choice; your
<br>
rate of fire might be significantly higher. 
<br>
Also, you're of course liable for whatever else (picture windows, people)
<br>
your rounds hit. And there's the &quot;discharging a firearm in town&quot; laws.
<br>
Rule 4: Be sure of your target.
