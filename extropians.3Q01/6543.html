&nbsp;Charlie:
<br>
I want to congratulate you on a truly excellent piece of work, produced in
<br>
such a short period of time.  Since it was posted to a public list, I hope
<br>
you won't mind if I share it with friends elsewhere.
<br>
<p>The long view you've taken is quite good and deeply correct, IMO, as far as
<br>
it goes.  With regard to the historical context, though, you pick the story
<br>
up at the point of the Crusades, which I think misses some important
<br>
foundational material.  I know I've been beating this drum fairly regularly
<br>
since I began my program of delving into Islamic culture this week, but I
<br>
honestly think we can't ignore the deeply bloody-minded nature of the Koran
<br>
and the violent beginnings of Islam.  While there's certainly more to the
<br>
story, I don't think you can deny that Mohammed was a fairly ignorant
<br>
merchant-pirate, and that a whole lot of the Koran and the Hadith are
<br>
basically the sayings and life-story of a man who developed a religion to
<br>
motivate and govern an army of conquest.  On the other hand, Jesus was
<br>
basically a pacifist (I know you can find a few exceptions in his sayings,
<br>
but they are the exceptions).  The distinction is important.  &quot;Christendom&quot;
<br>
has had to engage in a kind of ideological schizophrenia in order to wage
<br>
religious warfare (although, until relatively recently, it was remarkably
<br>
successful in doing so).  Islam, on the other hand, has to ignore
<br>
significant chunks of its own sacred texts to rationalize peace.
<br>
<p>This makes the program of &quot;cultural sculpting&quot; you prescribe very difficult.
<br>
You've basically said what I've been ruminating on for the last few days:
<br>
For the military action about to commence to be truly useful, it needs to
<br>
have clear, long-term goals of making fundamental changes in the structure
<br>
of society in the middle east.  As you say, we need to explicitly cultivate
<br>
Enlightenment values in the process, as we did in Japan.  You're right that
<br>
Japan and Germany are shining examples of how to do things RIGHT.
<br>
<p>A LOT of thought needs to be given to how the basic formula applied to the
<br>
vanquished Axis powers can be modified to work in the middle east.  So I
<br>
sincerely welcome your fine essay.
