<p>========
<br>
The split became clear on Friday when 11 anti-abortion allies called the
<br>
news conference at the Press Club, where they accused Mr. Bush of missing a
<br>
historic opportunity to close the door on stem cell research.
<br>
<p>&quot;The president's position contradicts the Nuremberg Code,&quot; said Wendy
<br>
Wright, the communications director of Concerned Women for America, a
<br>
conservative public policy group. &quot;We should be horrified at the prospect
<br>
of participating in research on embryos who are deliberately killed for the
<br>
same reason that we are horrified that gold fillings were taken from the
<br>
teeth of Holocaust victims.&quot;
<br>
<p>==========
<br>
<p>We should not be horrified at the prospect of participating in research on
<br>
embryos that are deliberately killed for the same reason we are not
<br>
horrified that transplant organs are taken from the corpses of accident
<br>
victims if permission has been granted.
<br>
<p>We should not be horrified at the prospect of participating in research on
<br>
embryos that are deliberately killed for the same reason we are not
<br>
horrified that skin cells are abraded from the faces of people washing
<br>
themselves.
<br>
<p>(Those embryos cannot be nurtured, brought to term and born as baby humans
<br>
without immense scientific and technological intervention. Now that nuclear
<br>
transfer is possible, the nuclear DNA and associated factors in any skin
<br>
cell has the same possibility of becoming a separate human if known
<br>
technologies are employed. Should we stop washing our faces to stop this
<br>
carnage of `potential lives'?)
