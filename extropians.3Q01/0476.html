</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the essence of you can be not only preserved but uploaded and

</em><br>
<em>&gt; very much like the notion of a &quot;soul&quot; that inhabits this body and

</em><br>
<em>&gt; by which this old dream/vision/wish can be made real.
</em><br>
<p>The point is that &quot;soul&quot; is probably the most famous of all the suitcase
<br>
terms.  I once proposed that it should be dissected, at least, into
<br>
&quot;immortal soul&quot;, &quot;extraphysical soul&quot;, &quot;weird-physics neurology&quot;,
<br>
&quot;morally-valent soul&quot; (atomic game-theoretical unit of moral
<br>
responsibility; &quot;free will&quot;), &quot;qualia&quot;, &quot;mind-state preservation&quot;, and
<br>
&quot;self-continuity&quot;.
<br>
<p>The issues involved on uploading bear on mind-state preservation,
<br>
self-continuity, qualia, and possibly weird-physics neurology.  It would
<br>
be both unjustified and sloppy to, by importing the suitcase term &quot;soul&quot;,
<br>
conflate the postulation of extraphysical immortality and religious
<br>
judgement with the idea of technological transference of self-continuity
<br>
of an informational pattern to a new substrate.  Essentially the same
<br>
issue of pattern continuity versus material continuity is raised by
<br>
molecular replacement in the human body.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I tend to be confident about my ability to handle what goes on in my head,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but I don't mess with social group polarization, I don't mess with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attaching moral valency to predictions (learned that the hard way), and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't mess with religious analogies.  I tend to regard these things as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cognitive equivalent of sticking your head in a microwave oven.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I tend to regard disowning hard questions using absurd analogies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the equivalent of sticking your head in the oven and lighting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a match. &lt;g&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am not disowning the hard questions, but yes, I am suggesting that we
<br>
should give absolutely no a-priori confidence to past attempts at
<br>
answering them; if there are any relevant ideas they should be considered
<br>
on a case-by-case basis rather than as part of a category.  Current
<br>
experience has shown (a) that past ideas are usually wrong and (b) that
<br>
people have a tendency to become sentimentally attached to past ideas.  I
<br>
would therefore argue either for complete neutrality (if confident of
<br>
rationality) or the use of a small corrective bias against ideas to which
<br>
you fear you may have become sentimentally attached (meta-rational
<br>
correction for estimates of self-fallibility).
<br>
<p>I don't think that anything is gained by dragging soulism into this and I
<br>
am not inclined to grant it the benefit of the doubt.
