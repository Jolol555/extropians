</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spike,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't believe you say this.  Here in Florida we sometimes have pollution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems where we have to shut down the beaches.  We have tar balls wash up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on shore. 
</em><br>
<p>Do you know for a fact that those tar balls do not come from natural
<br>
seepage?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have bacteria blooms. 
</em><br>
<p>Which are shown to be more related to periodic updrafts of cold
<br>
deepwater than to human pollution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have fish kills.  It is the ocean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent of bad air days.  Sometimes the pollution gets so bad that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starts killing things in the water, and they patrol the beach to keep humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from going in.  These can be directly traced back to petroleum products,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sewage streams, fertilizer runoff or cruise ship dumping.  There is a reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Jeb Bush doesn't want oil drilling of Florida's coast.  We are already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeing the problems with pollution.  As someone who has grown up in Florida
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and see these things, I can't imagine someone dismissing the concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ocean pollution.
</em><br>
<p>According to sources, there is more oil pollution from natural seepage
<br>
than from leaks from oil drilling and transport.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By the way, the reason the fish tastes the same is that we shut down Florida
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waters for fishing when bacteria or heavy metals get too high.  We have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regular patrols that measure contaminants in water and open/close areas as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pollution levels change.  In the water-management offices, there are whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maps showing current pollution levels.  The green areas of safety and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; red areas of contamination move around over the weeks like a weather map.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have had entire seasons of fishing or clamming canceled in various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counties due to sustained pollution levels.  We have state officers who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trace the pollutants back to the source, fine the company until they stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, and then monitor the polluted area for a few months or years until they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can open it up again.  We didn't have to do this when I was a kid.
</em><br>
<p>And back in the 'good old days', nobody knew about these things, and
<br>
people just died for the same reasons that were attributed to other
<br>
sources that people were aware of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't want anyone to think that I am anti-technology.  I am very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pro-technology.  However, we must be realistic.  Air pollution and water
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pollution really do exist.  They are not imaginary phenomenon or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conspiracies cooked up by the liberal left.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, they do, especially on the east coast, which gets the pollution of
<br>
everyone else in the country dumped on us. We in NH have, according to
<br>
the EPA, very poor air quality despite a low population density and no
<br>
air polluting industries or major airports. It all drifts in from the
<br>
midwest states. What I can say is that that sort of pollution really is
<br>
not that detectable at all.  I'll occasionally see a faint brown mist
<br>
appear a thousand or so feet over the Lebanon interchage in the
<br>
evenings, a few hours after rush hour. However, we've cleaned up so much
<br>
of our environment compared to when I was a kid. 
<br>
<p>I remember when the Androscoggin River up in northern NH was colored
<br>
orange and smelled to high heaven from pulping operations in Berlin.
<br>
Between the mill and the hydro station downstream in Berlin, there would
<br>
be 1-3 feet of suds on top of the orange water, and when the wind
<br>
shifted direction, those on the west side of the river received the full
<br>
brunt of the stink of the mill (which is why nobody lives on the east
<br>
side of the river). The mill spewed out a terrible orange/brown plume of
<br>
smoke that could be seen from 20 miles away (and smelled from that
<br>
distance).
<br>
<p>Today, the mill is still in operation, but the river is no longer the
<br>
mess it once was. It is clear and smells fine. The mill still smells
<br>
from the smell of rotting bark and the bleaching of pulp inside, but the
<br>
river is now a fine place to do fly fishing, and there are no worries
<br>
about them being toxic. The mill only emits a slight plume of white
<br>
steam, and they've stopped shipping logs down the river, everything is
<br>
by truck now. Atlantic salmon are back in migration in the watershed
<br>
now, as their spawning streams are protected from streamside logging,
<br>
and erosion controls are used.
<br>
<p>As for my local area here in Lebanon, I've got pictures from early in
<br>
the 20th century when there would be log jams miles long on the
<br>
Connecticutt river. They would scour out the beds of the river of all
<br>
life, and wipe out bridges as well. Today, there are no such log
<br>
shipments, and everyone gets in a tizzy if someone's riverbank collapses
<br>
from natural erosion.
