<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I dunno Lee.  It looked like a list of things you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't like.
</em><br>
<p>I actually possibly owe Russell an apology.  I don't clearly
<br>
remember which this was of two lists I was *trying* to come
<br>
up with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you like diversity?  Is there anything else on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list that you like?
</em><br>
<p>No, I don't like diversity at all (except economic diversity).
<br>
It leads to group consciousness and divisiveness.  Many people
<br>
thus just simply can't help but think of themselves as &quot;this
<br>
Jew&quot;, or &quot;this black woman&quot;, or &quot;this gay person&quot;, etc.  (Soon
<br>
due to demographic change, we'll all have a chance at being in
<br>
a minority and can be distinguished by our group identity as
<br>
well, although some, like Amish and Mormons are ahead of the
<br>
game already.)
<br>
<p>Well, under some conditions I like separatism and zenophobia,
<br>
because in recent centuries they proved adaptive IMO (that's
<br>
why they evolved, incidentally).  And to mix a whole lot of
<br>
threads together, if cryonics fails because America became 
<br>
too diverse, then I'll have to say that it was the atrophy
<br>
of our zenophobia that ended the lives of many people like me.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  Oops.  I really hope that I'm right that &quot;on this list
<br>
there are no forbidden topics!&quot;  P.P.S.  If you really want to
<br>
go into any of those, please start a different thread, thanks,
<br>
or, better yet, find one whose subjectl line is more similar.
