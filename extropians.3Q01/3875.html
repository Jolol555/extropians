<p>I believe you have made a slight mistake in your analysis above.
<br>
<p>A libertarian society would wish to refuse membership for those who do
<br>
not fill their requirement for membership. If a membr of such a society
<br>
did not (a) equip and train for armed combat, or (b) pay some police force
<br>
company to do that, that member would simply state its wish to refrain
<br>
from defending itself, a somewhat unusual request, but still a perfectly
<br>
valid request from any free entity. We should not wish to abridge that
<br>
members way to live its life.
<br>
<p>You stated your wish to live as a member of a corporeal entity, a nation
<br>
as it were, built on mandatory service to the collective. Others may wish
<br>
to use the market economy model instead, and hire specialists for their
<br>
security services. As you do not, it indicates your rightwingedness, a
<br>
tendency to view your local group as an extended family, instead of a
<br>
market, which would be the libertarian market economy model.
