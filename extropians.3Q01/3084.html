<p>Sounds interesting, Mike. Do you know whether references to any of these
<br>
surveys are online; if so, would you have any urls?
<br>
Gary Kleck's research deals mainly with guns, doesn't it? Couldn't find
<br>
anything on race. I did, however, find this:
<br>
<p>====================

<br>
Firearm fans love to cite a &quot;study&quot; that was done by Gary Kleck, a professor
<br>
of criminology at Florida State University. Kleck's work alleges that
<br>
civilians use guns in self defense up to 2.5 million times a year. But Dr.
<br>
David Hemenway, a professor at Harvard's School of Public Health, examined
<br>
Kleck's methodology and, in the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology,
<br>
concluded that the study had a &quot;huge overestimation bias.&quot;
<br>
<p>To expose the slipshod scholarship of Kleck and his colleague, Mark Gertz,
<br>
Hemenway applied their methodology to a 1994 ABC News/Washington Post survey
<br>
that asked the respondents if they had ever come into contact with an alien
<br>
or seen an alien space ship. With the Kleck and Gertz method being applied
<br>
to the alien question, you would be left with the following results: 20
<br>
million Americans have seen an alien space ship, and over a million have
<br>
actually met a being from another planet.
<br>
====================
<br>
<p>Note: I write this as a person who was given a gun as a child and taught how
<br>
to use it safely, and who has lived in an extremely dangerous neighborhood
<br>
and used a gun for protection. I agree that guns can be useful in such
<br>
situations. I have to say, though, that every year during deer hunting
<br>
season I'm subjected to the antics of would-be mountain men who take to the
<br>
woods with their guns, often consume large quantities of ethanol, and shoot
<br>
at anything that moves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  blacks commit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 90% of the crime perpetrated against other blacks, but a majority of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime perpetrated against whites.
</em><br>
<p>What sorts of crimes were included in this research, and what's the source
<br>
of the figures? The studies of this sort that I've seen deal with violent
<br>
crime and ignore such crimes as embezzlement and fraud.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, this could likely leave out victimless crimes
</em><br>
<p>I would think so, since it's based on interviews with victims.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studies of white collar crime, and its prevalence, should shed some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light on this. I would buy the fact that whites likely commit more white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collar crime than blacks, that being their more likely environment, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what are the actual numbers?
</em><br>
<p>Beats me. I will say that serious bodily injury and death strike me as far
<br>
more serious damages than loss of assets. I'd also say that blue collar
<br>
crime is generally harder work than white collar crime and, overall, results
<br>
in a lower income for the practioner. (I once had a guy call my law office,
<br>
seeking help to collect SS benefits. Seems he'd gotten into a fight when he
<br>
was in prison and was knocked from an upper bunk onto the floor, injuring
<br>
his back. He claimed that the injury prevented him from pursuing his chosen
<br>
profession of burglary, and he didn't have the education to go into
<br>
something more genteel like online bank fraud.) Better educational
<br>
opportunities for poor people would help to decrease violent crime, but to
<br>
make any real difference I think you'd also have to improve general living
<br>
conditions for the very poor.
