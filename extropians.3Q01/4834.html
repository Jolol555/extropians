[sigh] I should be working (or sleeping -- eeek! 4am!), shouldn't be 
<br>
answering this... but here goes...

</em><br>
<p>Again, I mention that this might work if we were motivated by economics 
<br>
alone, but it isn't so. People develop allegiances and cartels and 
<br>
anticompetitive practices like price fixing. They use marketing tactics to 
<br>
push shoddy merchandise. They propagate false information using advertising 
<br>
and misleading labels. Companies don't work very well to regulate each 
<br>
other... that is why we have government-funded investigations into illegal 
<br>
operating practices of some companies.
<br>
<p>I sorely doubt that trade unions would have much power in a free market... 
<br>
but that is just my opinion.
<br>
<p>As I have stressed time and time again. I am not against competitive 
<br>
capitalism. I am just wary of removing the most powerful control on 
<br>
corporate excess: government. I have no particular love of government 
<br>
either, being very conscious of how that power has been misused in the past 
<br>
too. All I am saying is that we must use the practical tools we have to 
<br>
limit the dangers of extreme power.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Already companies rate

</em><br>
<em>&gt;have much larger and powerfull roles.
</em><br>
<p>These sorts of things have shown up in some small way in the recent past 
<br>
and that is encouraging, but so far the bulk seem to be non-profit, 
<br>
generally government-supported.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;To remove feedback leads rapidly to things spiralling out of control, as we
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Which supports my suspicion that you mis-understand what exactly a free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;market entails.  It is not free reign for companies to do whatever they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want.  They will be regulated by how much a consumer is willing to pay and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what that consumer wants in a product.  These are the best forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feedback, instead of a government 'committee' trying to figure out what it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinks the best thing for everyone else is, instead of letting the people
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>:-)
<br>
Have you heard of the terms &quot;negative feedback&quot; and &quot;positive feedback&quot;? I 
<br>
mean in the engineering sense. Negative feedback is a stabilising system 
<br>
that corrects a change by using some of the output as a retarding input. 
<br>
Positive feedback is like the howlround when a microphone squeals.
<br>
<p>I can't see consumers being too much of a corrective force on companies 
<br>
when we have the proven power of positive feedback in the form of marketing 
<br>
and related strategies. Yes, there is some corrective power in the hands of 
<br>
the consumer, but nothing like the forces that cause corporations to merge 
<br>
into more and more powerful monolithic corporations. If we throw away 
<br>
government, our only really effective tool in breaking up dangerously large 
<br>
monopolies, then we are just on the path to feudalism -- that will not be 
<br>
the way to the free market that you want.
<br>
<p>You see the paradox here? We need a government to ensure that you get your 
<br>
free market. Left to themselves corporations divide up the field among 
<br>
themselves and eliminate competition.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;Capitalism works very well if you are rich. If you are not then you need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;other means. The biggest mistake rich classes make is in supposing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;they don't benefit from the poor improving their lot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sounds like you have some more misconceptions about free marketers...
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it seems that I understand it a bit better than you do. You are 
<br>
oversimplifying what is a complex web of motivations. People are motivated 
<br>
by much more than money. Worse, it can easily become a way of ensuring that 
<br>
class barriers remain. The tricky task is to use the better parts of 
<br>
capitalism while suppressing the worst.
<br>
<p>In most of your reply you made the same mistake that many people make when 
<br>
I express anything less than unqualified enthusiasm for capitalism. There 
<br>
are more positions than totally for capitalism and totally against 
<br>
capitalism. It reminds me of religion.
<br>
<p>It is easy to see the gains of capitalism; they are self evident and don't 
<br>
need to be labored. But likewise it is easy to see the drawbacks. The 
<br>
complex task before us is to get the good bits while using what we can to 
<br>
fight the bad bits. Like it or not, government can be a quite effective 
<br>
tool against some of the bad aspects of capitalism... even if it has become 
<br>
fashionable for many of them lately to relinquish that capability.
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
