Text of Statement From Osama Bin Laden
<br>
<p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP)--Here is the text of Osama bin Laden's
<br>
statement as provided on Monday by the Al-Jazeera television news network,
<br>
based in Qatar. It was translated from Arabic by The Associated Press. Some
<br>
sections of the faxed statement were illegible.
<br>
<p>In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful
<br>
<p>Sunday, 6 Rajab 1422 (Sept. 23, 2001)
<br>
<p>And for martyrs from their God their reward and light
<br>
<p>To our Muslim brothers in Pakistan
<br>
<p>Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and his blessings;
<br>
<p>I received with great sorrow the news of the murder of some of our Muslim
<br>
brothers in Karachi while they were expressing their opposition to the
<br>
American crusade forces and their allies on the lands of Muslims in Pakistan
<br>
and Afghanistan. We ask Allah to accept them as martyrs and include them
<br>
with prophets, their followers, martyrs, good doers and the like and ask
<br>
that their families be gifted with patience and consolation, and bless their
<br>
children and money, and reward well for their Islam.
<br>
<p>Whoever of them left children behind, they are my children, and I am their
<br>
caretaker, Allah willing.
<br>
<p>It is no wonder that the Muslim nation in Pakistan would rush to defend its
<br>
Islam, since it is considered the first line of defense for Islam in this
<br>
area, just like Afghanistan was the first line of defense for itself and for
<br>
Pakistan before the Russian invasion more than 20 years ago.
<br>
<p>We hope that these brothers are among the first martyrs in Islam's battle in
<br>
this era against the new Christian-Jewish crusade led by the big crusader
<br>
Bush under the flag of the Cross; this battle is considered one of Islam's
<br>
battles ...(text illegible)
<br>
<p>We incite our Muslim brothers in Pakistan to give everything they own and
<br>
are capable of to push the American crusade forces from invading Pakistan
<br>
and Afghanistan. The Prophet, Peace Be Upon Him, said: Whoever didn't fight,
<br>
or prepare a fighter, or take good care of a fighter's family, Allah will
<br>
strike him with a catastrophe before Judgment Day.
<br>
<p>I announce to you the good news my loved brothers that we are steadfast on
<br>
the path of Jihad for the sake of Allah, following the example of the
<br>
Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him), with the heroic, faithful Afghan people, under
<br>
the leadership of our fighter emir, who is proud of his religion, the prince
<br>
of the faithful, Mullah Mohammed Omar.
<br>
<p>We ask Allah to make him victorious over the forces of infidels and tyranny,
<br>
and to crush the new Christian-Jewish crusade on the land of Pakistan and
<br>
Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>If Allah makes you victorious, none will defeat you and if He fails you, who
<br>
after Him will make you victorious and on Allah the faithful shall trust.
<br>
<p>Your brother in Islam
<br>
<p>Osama bin Mohammed bin Laden
