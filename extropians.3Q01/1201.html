</em><br>
<em>&gt; areas where the state can expand into, especially if its limits (rights) are
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I seriously doubt this is a major reason behind the widespread use of fuzzy
<br>
terms like human dignity, integrity, autonomy and vulnerability in ethics.
<br>
It may be more of an European culture thing, where highly complex concepts
<br>
which are fairly clear after 10 years of scholarly study are preferred in
<br>
the debate to strictly defined and narrow concepts. Also, the stuff we are
<br>
trying to debate in ethics or the privacy discussion is very complex - it
<br>
might turn out that even the natural categories needed for this kind of
<br>
discussion are very complex and fuzzy.
<br>
<p>That said, it is clear that the fuzziness of these termes does lend itself
<br>
to being stretched/squeezed to fit political aims. But this might be more
<br>
of politicals exploiting lack of understanding of the concepts in the
<br>
general public than a promotion of bendable concepts in academia. That
<br>
promotion likely have other causes. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; As I see it, integrity is the ability to determine for oneself what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information to let in and out from oneself and to determine what one does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with it. I show integrity when I decide for myself whether to be swayed or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not by the opinions of others rather than just accept or allow myself to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; coerced into accepting them. My right to integrity means I can refrain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; revealing my thoughts or medical information, or demand ownership of such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information forcing e.g. a doctor not to reveal it to a third party.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see how this differs from privacy.  The input of information does,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the output does not.  In fact, from this, it would appear that integrity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here means privacy plus control over inputs.  Some might even argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlling inputs is a matter of privacy too.  After all, I should be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to choose what to read, watch, or listen to in my home, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. I might have a right to say whatever I want, but you don't have to
<br>
listen to it and you definitely do not have to believe it. 
<br>
<p>On the other hand, privacy as it is generally used seems to deal more with
<br>
the more external aspects of ones self and life than integrity.
