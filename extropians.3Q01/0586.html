<em>&gt; &gt; Hi, all! I got this off the Extropy website and

<em>&gt; Well, I have to say that I don't. What _is_ your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questioning?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I don't know that, I can't understand the source

</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>Sorry, Mike. &quot;Blah blah blah...wonder what it all
<br>
means to us.&quot; was a suggestion of it. I was trying not
<br>
to be antagonistic, and at times being too direct can
<br>
cause people to think this. The perils of being a
<br>
newbie, I guess. :)
<br>
<p>Yes, my question is this: the recent religious war
<br>
seems to fly in the face of most of Max More's
<br>
outline, and I wonder if a war at all is in keeping
<br>
with these principles. Are these principles really
<br>
part of extropian thinking? Were they just Max More's
<br>
own interpretation of extropianism, an interpretation
<br>
that it is not necessary to agree with to call onself
<br>
an extropian?
<br>
<p>Just didn't expect such hot tempers on this list. I
<br>
know nothing, Mike, but am a very peaceful person.
<br>
Just trying to understand, and leaving open-endedness
<br>
for the sake of a thorough education. Sorry it was so
<br>
nebulous.
<br>
<p>It doesn't seem like defending religion or debunking
<br>
it requires anger or insults. It seems anger and
<br>
insult actually detracted from the arguments I read,
<br>
making the spiritual people (who would often have
<br>
everyone believe they were more peaceful people for
<br>
it) very belligerent, and also making the anti-theists
<br>
seem irrrational, reminiscent of the day I saw a
<br>
2-year-old scream at everyone because he had erasers
<br>
stuck in his ears but couldn't hear anyone who was
<br>
trying to help.
<br>
<p>I am at a loss after reading Max's list. I am sure it
<br>
is of very little consequence overall, but religion
<br>
and anti-religion are two things I would like to
<br>
understand better. I can't this way. Both sides in
<br>
this war were not only uninformative, but I now
<br>
understand less than before. So I question extropian
<br>
principles in light of the war.
<br>
<p>I realize I am leaving myself open to being bashed by
<br>
both sides of the conflict, but there it is. Bash
<br>
away, I am tough and won't strike back. It is not my
<br>
way.
<br>
