At 07:46 PM 7/28/01 -0400, Eliezer, a sentient being, wrote (perhaps a tad
<br>
patronisingly):

<p>=======================
<br>
<p>This is cryptic to the point of opacity. `Sentience' means `having the
<br>
power of sense perception' (Concise Oxford Dictionary), or more loosely
<br>
`the capacity to register feelings'. (For some weird reason, sf writers
<br>
long ago chose to distinguish intelligent [usually alien and baffling]
<br>
beings as `sentients' when they meant what Poul Anderson later felicitously
<br>
dubbed `sophonts'; his coinage alas never caught on.)
<br>
<p>Presumably Eliezer means that he's a guy richly, even especially, endowed
<br>
with Feeeelings, including empathy for all the children of the Earth and
<br>
indeed the cosmos. We can be sure that someone like that is flooded with
<br>
empathy for the victims of egregious wrongs, and highly motivated to do
<br>
what ve can to compensate for the evil effects of those wrongs.
<br>
<p>I suppose that might be what's meant.
<br>
<p>BTW, I would assert myself that Olga isn't trying to *blame* today's
<br>
non-racist whites for the ills done by their ancestors (or even by other
<br>
less enlightened whites today) to, for example, Pat Fallon's ancestors. I
<br>
believe she was arguing correctly, as Nazi work camp survivors have done
<br>
effectively in court, that their stolen labor partly underpins the wealth
<br>
of today's whites and so requires some compensation. Seems reasonable to
<br>
me. But then I feel that way, in some measure, about all the un- or
<br>
underpaid labor of all the poor working stiffs throughout history--nearly
<br>
all the ancestors of nearly all of us.
<br>
<p>But the reparation details are easier to calculate, perhaps, for the
<br>
descendents of explicit slaves in a rich nation.
