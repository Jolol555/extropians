</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Reason *is* a minor factor!  We obtain our initial beliefs in any given
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; area by various processes ... an entire gestalt very quickly calculated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; by your brain.  ...  Reason will have nothing to do with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course if evolution had primarily wanted us to hold true beliefs, it might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have made those unconscious processes mirror reason in many ways,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including the use of criticism.  So the question is to what extent brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolved to seek truth, vs. other goals for beliefs.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, there are a certain, though limited number of examples where
<br>
fitness is improved by false belief.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; So, now that we were free to *conjecture* a new belief,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; guess what?  We immediately seized upon the belief that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; was the most emotionally compelling, to wit, the one that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; favored our own candidate in a highly charged election.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once you realize that you are biased toward your candidate, you can correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your beliefs without elaborate use of reason.  Just move your beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the direction of beliefs favored by those who like the other candidate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you realize you have this option, and choose not to use it, I think you must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admit to yourself that you are not really truth-seeking in this area.
</em><br>
<p>That would only work if you had some confidence or faith in those
<br>
who liked the other candidate.  As an example, suppose that you
<br>
do not believe in God, but wish to be as truth-seeking as possible.
<br>
It does not follow that you should &quot;move your beliefs in the direction
<br>
of beliefs favored&quot; by those who are religious.  You may have concluded
<br>
that they are simply out to lunch for some reason (explanation).
<br>
<p>However, I am interested in any other brief tricks that you may know of
<br>
to assist one in being really truth-seeking.
<br>
