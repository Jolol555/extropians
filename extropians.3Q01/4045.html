</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Once again, Joe, you are quite wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
There was indeed a period of liberation in Sarajevo after the dissolution of Yugoslavia and before Milosevic, with the help of Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, laid siege to the city and began shelling it from the surrounding mountains and sending in the snipers, and the brave inhabitants of that city sustained it.   Even when the siege was happening to them, they celebrated, as much as possible, their cognitive freedon from the right-wing racist animus motivating their besiegers, presenting concerts and plays even in the midst of the carnage.  Their spirits refused to be defeated.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; One way to tell social liberals and social conservatives apart, even when one or both claim to be libertarian, is that the social liberals don't hate/fear the word 'different' and worship the word 'similar'.  In fact, the so-called 'rugged individualist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;s' of the Reagan era were among the mosy monochromatic clones I can recall; the real individuals are the ones they despised because of their diversity and multi(ple)culure(alism).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Once again, you show your true colors, Joe. Demonizing, again, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opponents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Don't be upset because I borrowed your colors, Mike, for you well and truly own them; you are justly infamous for your liberal use of the 'statist', 'collectivist', 'liberal (as if that's a dirty word)',  'pinko', 'authoritarian', 'fellow-traveller', 'commie' smear.
