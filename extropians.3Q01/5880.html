Tim said
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;So, I've given it some time, and so far I have not been pointed to any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quantitative sources on the reported overall technological acceleration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't know whether this means that there are no such sources, but it does
</em><br>
<em>&gt;appear to mean that those here who believe in this acceleration have taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it as an article of faith, rather than on empirical or reproducible
</em><br>
grounds.
<br>
<p>Tim, I think this is too harsh. I'd say most of us seldom take things &quot;as an
<br>
article of faith&quot;, ie believe something with no rational basis for the
<br>
belief, such as accepting a proposition because some holy man or holy book
<br>
says it's true.
<br>
<p>We may not always be *correct*, but that's a different issue.
<br>
<p>In the case of &quot;quantitative sources on .... overall technological
<br>
acceleration&quot;, you are asking too much.
<br>
<p>I'd say we all believe there was a massive acceleration from the 17th
<br>
century through to the mid-20th century, not based on &quot;faith&quot; but on our
<br>
knowledge of history. We know that the economic and technological base of
<br>
society could change very little for entire lifetimes previous to that era.
<br>
Human thought in any society you care to name was dominated by a pastoral
<br>
concept of time in which there was nothing new under the sun and everything
<br>
moved in cycles. &quot;Oh Mutability, oh perfect wheel!&quot; The only idea of a
<br>
one-way movement in history was that found in the eschatologies of certain
<br>
religions (mainly but not only Christianity).
<br>
<p>Of course, there could be massive changes brought about in a life time as a
<br>
result of conquest, dynastic rivalry, plague, exploration, the revival of
<br>
classical learning (those folks in antiquity knew so much more than we did,
<br>
so it was thought), and *occasional, specific* technological innovations,
<br>
but there was no real concept of technological progress because the rate of
<br>
technological change was almost unobservable to most people.
<br>
<p>The scientific revolution of the 17th century started to change this and the
<br>
industrial revolution of the late 18th and early 19th centuries even more
<br>
so. By the 19th century, changes in the economic and technological bases of
<br>
society were observable on a dramatic scale within individual lifetimes.
<br>
Wearing my hat as a literary scholar, I would point out how this led to
<br>
important cultural reflections in the 19th century, including the rise of
<br>
science fiction, as it started to make sense to imagine a technologically
<br>
different future, and the rise of fantasy as it made sense to long for an
<br>
idyllic life *in reaction to* the physically ugly technological changes of
<br>
the time. The beautiful art of the pre-Raphaelites (of which I am a great
<br>
fan - its luddite underpinnings are largely irrelevant to our period, and
<br>
made good sense in its own period) cannot be understood except against that
<br>
backdrop. It is interesting to read the work of William Morris, Thomas Hardy
<br>
and H.G. Wells in the 1890s to see how they all show this pressing awareness
<br>
of change - though expressing it in completely different ways.
<br>
<p>During the first 60 or 70 years of the 20th century, technological change
<br>
continued to happen quickly.
<br>
<p>All my knowledge of science, history, art and literature converges to tell
<br>
me this. It's not a matter of &quot;faith&quot;.
<br>
<p>When you want a quantitative measure, you are asking us to come up with the
<br>
impossible. There is no accepted unit in which we measure the pace of
<br>
technological change. We have to argue about it essentially in the way I've
<br>
done above. If you don't accept this style of argument you are guilty of the
<br>
intellectual crime of premature reductionism (I've got nothing against
<br>
reductionism; the problem as I've explained elsewhere and as Lee Corbin also
<br>
explained in an excellent post a few weeks back is *premature*
<br>
reductionism - it's a bit like the problem of premature ejaculation). In
<br>
that case, I can't help you.
<br>
<p>FWIW, however, you can measure such things as the increasing maximum speed
<br>
of transportational devices, increasing speed and power of communications,
<br>
etc. There are plenty of sources which deal with these crude surrogate
<br>
measures of the pace of technological change.
<br>
<p>The only issue is whether the pace of change slowed down in the last few
<br>
decades of the 20th century, perhaps from the mid-1960s, as Zubrin has
<br>
argued.
<br>
<p>Since we don't have an agreed unit, this issue is very difficult.
<br>
<p>Zubrin looks at the changes that took place from 1906 to 1966 and compares
<br>
them with what happened from 1966 to 1996. I quote from his _The Case for
<br>
Mars_:
<br>
<p>&quot;Compared to these changes, the technological innovations from 1966 to the
<br>
present seem insignificant.  Immense changes should have occurred during
<br>
this period but did not.  Had we been following the previous sixty years'
<br>
technological trajectory, we today would have videotelephones, solar-powered
<br>
cars, maglev (magnetic levitation) trains, fusion reactors, hypersonic
<br>
intercontinental travel, reliable and inexpensive transportation to Earth
<br>
orbit, undersea cities, open-sea mariculture, and human settlements on the
<br>
Moon and Mars. Instead, today we see important technological developments,
<br>
such as nuclear power and biotechnology, being blocked or enmeshed in
<br>
controversy - we are slowing down.&quot;
<br>
<p>I think that this position is arguable, though I also think that Zubrin
<br>
tends to fudge. For example, motor cars and aircraft, electricity and the
<br>
internal combustion engine were invented before 1906, but he puts them in
<br>
the 1906-1966 period. What actually happened during that period was a
<br>
tremendous development and proliferation of those technologies. To play
<br>
fair, we would need to include the development and proliferation from 1966
<br>
to 1996 of technologies that were initiated earlier, but Zubrin also tends
<br>
to put these in the 1906-1966 period. Once that point is acknowledged, it
<br>
seems apparent that electronic and biomedical technologies produced immense
<br>
change in the later decades of the 20th century.
<br>
<p>Zubrin also has a fixation with technologies that have a direct macro-level
<br>
presence in our environment: big things that become part of the landscape,
<br>
such as air and space vehicles, movie screens, lit up cities, nuclear
<br>
reactors. Although he does mention antibiotics and expresses regret at the
<br>
controversy enmeshing modern biotechnology, he largely forgets technologies
<br>
that are hidden away in the recesses of our homes, offices or vehicles, or
<br>
our bodies themselves - which is where I see technology increasingly headed.
<br>
Most glaringly, he omits to mention that the contraceptive pill was invented
<br>
in the early 1960s (analogously to powered air vehicles in the early 1900s).
<br>
Thereupon, the rapid development and distribution of powerful contraceptive
<br>
technology largely overturned the Western world's sexual mores. I don't know
<br>
why this extraordinary change is so often overlooked by thinker about the
<br>
future (interestingly, Arthur C. Clarke, arguably the greatest such thinker
<br>
of all in recent decades, predicted something of the sort in _Childhood's
<br>
End_ in the early 1950s, but he has never discussed it in the various
<br>
editions of _Profiles of the Future_).
<br>
<p>Leaving sex out of it (though why would anyone wish to do so &lt;g&gt;?), a
<br>
reading of any modern work in the fields of medicine or bioethics will show
<br>
how modern biomedical technology has transformed clinical practice,
<br>
rendering our traditional ideas of life and death themselves problematic,
<br>
and challenging us to recast some of our most basic ethical principles.
<br>
Peter Singer has written extensively on this.
<br>
<p>In that light, the &quot;faith&quot; that many of us could be accused of having, that
<br>
the next 30 years from the point when Zubrin was writing - i.e. the years
<br>
from 1996 to 2026 - will see the development of unprecedentedly powerful
<br>
biotechnologies based on human genome research etc, seems quite realistic.
<br>
However, until we start to use our genetic knowledge to morph our bodies in
<br>
outwardly spectacular ways - growing ourselves fins, spines, additional
<br>
limbs, or modified skins of some kind - advanced biotechnology will not
<br>
alter the streetscape, let alone the landscape, in the way that would seem
<br>
necessary to attract Zubrin's attention. Still, it would be naive to deduce
<br>
from this that the effects of the coming genomic and proteonomic revolutions
<br>
will be isolated or trivial.
<br>
<p>As I mentioned above, computers are assigned by Zubrin to the period from
<br>
1906 to 66 - more specifically, the period from 1936-66 - notwithstanding
<br>
that the development of computer technology by the mid-60s was in what now
<br>
seems a primitive state. If the development of electricity and the internal
<br>
combustion engine is to be assigned to the 1906-36 period, the development
<br>
of digital information technologies must fairly be assigned to 1966-96.
<br>
During that time, computers became faster, smaller, more flexible, more
<br>
powerful - and almost ubiquitous. We are not confronted with giant
<br>
mainframes lumbering about the streets like dinosaurs, but the tools we use
<br>
are computerised, and the world is linked and moulded by computerised
<br>
systems of transport and communication.
<br>
<p>Zubrin's account of what &quot;should&quot; have happened in recent decades lists the
<br>
following among the technologies that were never developed:
<br>
&quot;videotelephones, solar-powered cars, maglev . . . trains, fusion reactors
<br>
[and] hypersonic intercontinental travel&quot;. But such a list contains
<br>
preconceptions of what the future (seen from the mid-1960s) should have
<br>
been. Perhaps some of these marvels will yet come to pass &lt;g&gt;. Solar-powered
<br>
cars would make sense environmentally, and the technology is improving to an
<br>
impressive degree. More apparent since the 60s, however, has been an
<br>
enormous increase in the detailed sophistication of motor cars from the
<br>
uncomfortable, unreliable creatures I remember from 30 years ago when I
<br>
commenced driving. Modern cars, with their wonderful electronics and
<br>
materials and their built-in computer technology show remarkable
<br>
consideration for our needs. The damn things are almost alive, dominating us
<br>
subtly, like lovers or designer drugs.
<br>
<p>As for Zubrin's videotelephone example, the telephone is not, in any full
<br>
sense, an extension of our capacity for direct, face-to-face
<br>
communication... it is not truly an extension of our presence. It is
<br>
actually an *alternative* to  that; it is a device that makes intimate
<br>
communication possible, not only when we are physically separated, but when
<br>
physical presence would be inconvenient. With a phone, we can communicate
<br>
early in the morning before making ourselves appear human, during the day at
<br>
the office when we may be bad tempered and red-faced, late at night from the
<br>
informal comfort of our bedrooms.
<br>
<p>It is likely that prototype videotelephones did not catch on for these sorts
<br>
of reasons (I've seen some more precise accounts that suggest this, but I
<br>
don't have any URLs handy at the moment). Anyway, if I can project my
<br>
presence into your home or office or vehicle, I would rather wait until the
<br>
technology lets me provide some computer-massaged idealisation, rather than
<br>
the real me, in whatever irrelevant state of dress or undress, activity or
<br>
sloth I find myself. Video conferencing does find uses in situations where
<br>
telepresence is relevant and desirable. I have sometimes used it for simple
<br>
court hearings. But that is just the point: technologies find their own
<br>
uses. In retrospect, it is unsurprising that the miniaturisation of the
<br>
telephone and its integration with fax and the Internet have proved to be
<br>
higher priorities than augmenting it with the dubious convenience of video.
<br>
<p>As we work through Zubrin's list, and react to it, it becomes apparent that
<br>
we have been developing our technologies to make our environments and even
<br>
our bodies more convenient, comfortable, comformable to our wills. This is
<br>
the transhumanist trajectory, folks. We control our fertility by various
<br>
effective methods that are now available, shaping our lifestyles
<br>
accordingly. In the home, the car, the factory and the office, we have more
<br>
and more sophisticated electronics. Often we ask ourselves how we coped at
<br>
all without word-processing, photocopying, and fax machines - and without
<br>
scanners, PowerPoint projectors, e-mail and access to the Web. As anyone
<br>
knows who works, as I do, in labour relations law, job classifications and
<br>
duties have become unrecognisable from the perspective of the mid-60s.
<br>
Industry has been transformed by computer-aided design and manufacture.
<br>
Technological innovation has taken paths different from what would have been
<br>
expected if, as Zubrin puts it, we had &quot;been following the previous sixty
<br>
years' technological trajectory&quot;. That does not necessarily mean we are
<br>
slowing down.
<br>
<p>To sum up, I think there are powerful arguments that there was a massive
<br>
technological acceleration from, say, 1610 (Galileo observes the moons of
<br>
Jupiter) to 1969 (the moon landing). After the mid to late 60s, there are
<br>
arguments available, most compellingly put by Zubrin, that the pace of
<br>
technological innovation has actually slowed down. However, I think I can
<br>
show (as I've attempted above) that Zubrin's argument contains holes.
<br>
<p>None of the arguments uses a simple measure of technological change in some
<br>
agreed unit - though, up to a point, you can use surrogate measures such as
<br>
the physical speed of our devices. I suspect that Damien B and Robin Hanson,
<br>
among others here, would be in a good position to extract some of the data
<br>
on various surrogate measures of the rate of technological change and,
<br>
hence, whether it is accelerating.
<br>
<p>But the arguments really do demand a lot of philosophical reasoning, relying
<br>
on consilience of inductions, etc. To insist on arguing in a different way,
<br>
especially if it is supposed to be the entirety of the argument, is to
<br>
commit the fallacy of premature reductionism. The issue is *not* about
<br>
&quot;faith&quot;.
<br>
<p>I hope this helps clarify the issues, even if I don't convince Tim.
<br>
<p>Cheers
<br>
