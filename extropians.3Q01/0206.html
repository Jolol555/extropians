&quot;J. R. Molloy&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jr@shasta.com?Subject=Re:%20Debunk%20All%20Religiosity%20Equally%20(D.A.R.E.)&In-Reply-To=&lt;200107032312.RAA21379@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">jr@shasta.com</a>&gt; answered why we should want
<br>
to &quot;debunk&quot; religion with:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Because we won't move into a better future until we defeat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religiosity, which is the most regressive force now operating in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, religion is simply &quot;a way of life&quot; so everyone has one.
<br>
Mine happens to be extropianism.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is all probably just semantic differences.  To me all
<br>
theistic religions should definitely be &quot;debunked&quot;, fought against,
<br>
considered evil and hopeless.  It's for the simple reason, that if
<br>
there is already a God (or any powerful ET out their hiding from us),
<br>
then what extropians want to do (eliminate all bad [or evil&gt;]) cannot
<br>
be done, even if we become as powerful as these Gods.  For if they
<br>
can't, or shouldn't, or don't help us overcome it faster/sooner we
<br>
can't or shouldn't or won't help our children and others we find in
<br>
the universe the same way.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My definition of God is simply: That for which when it exists,
<br>
there will be no more evils like isolation, suffering, dieing...  To
<br>
believe there is already a &quot;God&quot; while there is still such evils
<br>
cannot be &quot;faith&quot; or &quot;hope&quot; but instead is the ultimate in giving up
<br>
in faithless despair.  For that means something like God is impotent,
<br>
evil, or that evil is for some reason so necessary, even God can't
<br>
overcome it....  with the implication that we too, will not be able
<br>
to overcome it all even if we become as powerful as that God supposedly
<br>
is.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only an atheist can have true faith an hope.  Believing in
<br>
God is not only &quot;faithless&quot;, but it results in many other
<br>
fundamentally evil beliefs and behaviors like hate and so on (as in
<br>
Christians hate their devil, the people that crucified Christ...).
<br>
You cannot, thereby, both believe in God (or ETs or anything else that
<br>
is powerful and out there hiding from us) and be an extropian.  The
<br>
two are logically mutually exclusive.
<br>
