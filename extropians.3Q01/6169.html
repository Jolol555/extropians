<em>&gt; Perhaps I am thinking first world and I should be thinking third world. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have no idea how someone puts together an operation like this and pulls it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off with the level of intelligence in place today. Something like this has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be planned a long time out and some warnings should have gone off. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was not something a dozen individuals thought up last week would be a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What would it take at minimum?  Four crews of say 3-4 people
<br>
each, armed with undetectable kinds of knives and possessing
<br>
basic combat fighting skils; one person per team who is
<br>
minimally able to handle a large commercial carrier in flight;
<br>
careful picking of flights for intersecting times;  getting all
<br>
teams on board; handling the flight crew.  
<br>
<p>I don't see why this would need to be planned that terribly far
<br>
in advance.  A month or two should be sufficient given enough
<br>
really dedicated people with the basic talents.   If the group
<br>
is really zealous it shouldn't be that hard to keep the plan
<br>
quite for that kind of timeframe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also as I said, 4 airliners not on flight plan? And no red flags are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off. If nothing else there should be a scramble to find and track the planes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for their own protection in case some weird error is happening in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations flight control system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From what I have understood there was one other bit of
</em><br>
sophistication, knowing how to turn off some of the tracking
<br>
devices.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; And all of this in a situation where individuals have allowed government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intrusion into their lives, accept four hour check in times, etc just so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this would not happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To me that is incompetency beyond belief.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so.  But perhaps I am missing something.
