Steve Davies writes (on top of several outstanding posts by
<br>
others)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is true for other countries as well as the US - plenty of work on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; British case for example. Here we have just officially confirmed that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under 35s have a lower standard of literacy than was the case before WW I!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On a slightly different point, bearing in mind the nature of this list, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nobody else struck by how backward education is and lacking in innovation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared to other areas of life?
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely.  And the reason is that the free market has not
<br>
been allowed to work its magic.  I wrote in another thread
<br>
about how supermarket managers have an incentive to think
<br>
all day long (and possibly even after they retire) of ways
<br>
to improve their stores.  I think that it would take less
<br>
than twenty years to see an absolutely unprecedented boom
<br>
in the quality of education were principals and administrators
<br>
lying awake at night thinking about how to lure students and
<br>
their parents to their schools, and what particular &quot;angle&quot;
<br>
they could work on, how they could specialize, how they indeed
<br>
could identify some unserviced element of the population that
<br>
they could exploit.
<br>
<p>(Yes, sorry about the word &quot;exploit&quot;.  I know what a number
<br>
of leftists will make of that!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm also struck by the way most people assume education
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [is the same thing as] schooling.  Surely, with modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology there must be more than one method of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delivering education.  It's like assuming there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only one possible kind of food store.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly!  By far the best way (and perhaps the only way) to
<br>
improve education is to restore free choice.  Yes, I know,
<br>
&quot;freedom&quot; is a rather out-dated 18th century concept, and I
<br>
know that it won't be tried except as a last resort, but
<br>
the education situation is so dismal that even freedom is
<br>
worth giving a shot.
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; Like James, I think state education is unbelievably bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at its purported task - a language school can teach most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people conversational fluency in a foreign language in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about 80 hours.  Most British pupils can't manage anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like that after five years of secondary education.
