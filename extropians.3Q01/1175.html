<p><em>&gt; &gt; worries me when you talk about truth being less important, about requiring

</em><br>
<em>&gt; It depends very much on what you mean by &quot;truth&quot;.  There are
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; visions of what can be that are not so easy to touch with those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tools but they are crucially important also.  ...
</em><br>
<p>You're talking to a social scientist who also feels very comfortable
<br>
talking physics or moral philosophy - to me it is all one whole with
<br>
similar tools throughout.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What was said about trusting the messages from the deep self, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at any rate from beyond the range of the self-aware, conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual mind is both very true and very difficult to learn

</em><br>
<p>I suppose then it is difficult for you to explain to us why we
<br>
should believe this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Believing that what is good for me is good for the world is exactly one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of those areas where we should expect people to be self-deceived.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't all of us here do precisely that?  We all believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; augmenting ourselves and running technology all out to reach the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity is good for us and for the world.  We believe it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of what most of the world has to say.
</em><br>
<p>If we just believe it without consideration, because it feels so
<br>
natural to believe it, then yes, we are likely self-deceived.
<br>
We may happen to be right, but that is no excuse for excess
<br>
confidence.
