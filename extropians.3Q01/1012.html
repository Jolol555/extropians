<p>Ooooh... I do hope you said this with your tongue heavily in your cheek.
<br>
<p>Ants, bees, termites, and wasps clearly became so successful by victimising 
<br>
their weaker sisters within the nest... not! Birds and mammals survive so 
<br>
well because they don't protect their families... not!  Even centipedes 
<br>
care for their eggs, cleaning them till birth.
<br>
<p>The USA doesn't have the highest standard of living in the western world 
<br>
because of the way the rich feed off the poor there. The Swedes, with their 
<br>
universal safety net for their citizens, have for a long time had the 
<br>
highest standard of living in the world (it may be slipping a bit now as I 
<br>
believe they recently got a right wing govt). Reagan, with his heavily 
<br>
pro-market-economy stance gave USA the distinction of the highest infant 
<br>
mortality rate in the developed world. [Maybe this is a good time to don my 
<br>
asbestos suit.]
<br>
<p>Nature, red in tooth and claw is a 19th century concept. It is only half of 
<br>
the picture. Altruism is the other half.
<br>
<p>The really cool thing about humans is this incredible brain we possess. We 
<br>
don't know where the next brilliant mind will come from. The little kid 
<br>
whose mother is barely scraping by on welfare may be the one who solves the 
<br>
problem of non-destructively scanning the human brain for uploading.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
