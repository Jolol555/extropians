<em>&gt; Sorry, Mike. &quot;Blah blah blah...wonder what it all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means to us.&quot; was a suggestion of it. I was trying not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be antagonistic, and at times being too direct can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause people to think this.
</em><br>
<p>Understood. And a good question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, my question is this: the recent religious war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to fly in the face of most of Max More's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outline, and I wonder if a war at all is in keeping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with these principles.
</em><br>
<p>I think it's very important to, as it were, _choose_ rather
<br>
than _pick_ fights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just didn't expect such hot tempers on this list.
</em><br>
<p>*sigh* :\ :) I hear that loud &amp; clear.
<br>
<p>&lt;further good comments elided&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am at a loss after reading Max's list. I am sure it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is of very little consequence overall, but religion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and anti-religion are two things I would like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand better. I can't this way. Both sides in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this war were not only uninformative, but I now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand less than before. So I question extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles in light of the war.
</em><br>
<p>And well you might. But I'd advise you to note that
<br>
a lot of list members (myself included) _have not_ contributed
<br>
to that thread up to this point. It's hard to notice people
<br>
not doing something...
<br>
<p>In my case, it is/was because the D.A.R.E subject line 
<br>
repelled me. I didn't want to get dragged into what I expected
<br>
might be setpiece arguments by a few strongly opinionated
<br>
list members. From what you've said, I guess I was right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I realize I am leaving myself open to being bashed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both sides of the conflict, but there it is. Bash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away, I am tough and won't strike back. It is not my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way.
</em><br>
<p>Nor mine. I'm learning diplomacy myself. Maybe I'll get my diploma some day. :)
