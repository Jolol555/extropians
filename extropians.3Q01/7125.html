<p>
When I said before that this was gonna be up-close and personal violence
<br>
in your living room, I hope people understood I was referring to the
<br>
network news. But it's gonna be more than that. I think we can expect
<br>
survivor and family stories for years, in magazines, the paper, talk
<br>
shows. People are gonna be hitting each with chairs about this on the
<br>
sleazy talk shows. It's gonna be love, hate, loyalty, jealousy, faith,
<br>
doubt, etc etc etc. And it's gonna go on for a long time. And we are
<br>
gonna see that airplane slamming into that building again and again and
<br>
again and again and again.
<br>
<p>Sometimes folks are gonna break down and cry for no apparent reason at
<br>
all. Expect to see this a lot on TV and in the street in the coming
<br>
months.
<br>
<p>And it's gonna be called the Attack. Not 911. Not the terror-bombing of
<br>
WTC (we've had two of those, now). Not the Attack on America or some
<br>
media shit like that. Whatever the media names it, in day to day
<br>
conversation it'll be the Attack. These things happened before the
<br>
Attack. These things happened after the Attack. Oh yeah, I knew her
<br>
before the Attack. I met him after the Attack. Yeah, but that was
<br>
pre-Attack. The post-Attack society.
<br>
<p>World War II is a big name for a big war. A long process, carried out
<br>
orderly. Battles. Campaigns. Thousands of tanks and airplanes. National
<br>
efforts. Decades ago. Same with any other major killing field that
<br>
people date history from (adjusting for period, of course). Everything
<br>
now happened after Waterloo. But many things now happened before the
<br>
Attack.
<br>
<p>The Attack is immediate. It stays with people. It's a constant reminder
<br>
that hate now travels as immediately as information. And depending on
<br>
what we do and say now, maybe it could always be called the Attack.
<br>
Which would be much better than calling it the First Attack. Then we'd
<br>
start talking about the Second Attack. The Third Attack. That Last
<br>
Attack. The Attack last week. And after we lose count then we might as
<br>
well call it a World War.
<br>
<p>Shit,
<br>
