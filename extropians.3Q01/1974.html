<p>
I'll comment on Helen's queries.
<br>
<p>Helen asked:
<br>
<em>&gt; Part of my work concerns the preachings of people who argue about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics of combining the human body with machine parts.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is those &quot;preachings&quot; fail to recognize that the body
<br>
*is* already a collection of machine parts.  I like to point out
<br>
to people that since every human has on or in them ~40 trillion
<br>
bacteria, each &quot;body&quot; hosts more copies of programs for autonomous
<br>
self-replicating machines than copies of its own genetic program
<br>
(i.e. the bacterial cells outnumber our cells).  A mitochondria
<br>
is a machine.  A cell is a machine.  A heart is a machine.
<br>
We are machines (bodies) made up of machines (organs) made up
<br>
of machines (cells) made up in part of machines (mitochondria)
<br>
made up in part of machines (proteins) made up of atoms.
<br>
<p>The problem arises from a mistaken concept that you can only build
<br>
machines out of steel.  If I build a machine out of plastic is
<br>
it any less of a machine?  What about nanotechnology research
<br>
being done at Cornell or the University of Washington where the
<br>
&quot;machines&quot; that are used in the experiments as &quot;motors&quot; are
<br>
the very same proteins our own body uses?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What are your responses to these attacks on human enhancement.
</em><br>
<p>We are already enhanced.  My face would have to be ~3 inches from
<br>
my computer screen for me to read the text without my &quot;enhancements&quot;.
<br>
Someday, I'll get that enhancement made permanent with laser surgery.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What are your feelings regarding what 'human' actually is?
</em><br>
<p>Human is a &quot;suitcase&quot; term, its used to describe both our biological
<br>
bodies as well as the way we interact with each other as well as
<br>
our intelligence.  If you want to explore the topic, one way to
<br>
start is to start with a definition of 'human' straight out of
<br>
the dictionary and then start to break it down into its
<br>
different meanings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it really possible to compare the human body to a mechanical system,
</em><br>
<p>Ask almost any doctor, esp. for example, surgeons.  It *is* a mechanical
<br>
system.  There is an entire scientific field called &quot;biomechanics&quot;.
<br>
The field of &quot;biopysics&quot; explains how our cells work on the basis of
<br>
physical laws while &quot;biochemistry&quot; explores how our cells function
<br>
according to chemical laws.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and if so, then what's so important about enhancing as humans,
</em><br>
<p>Human longevity is fundentally limited by the hazard function
<br>
(our exposure to things that kill us).  Unenhanced humans have
<br>
a higher hazard function (shorter life-span) than enhanced
<br>
humans who would be more resistant to diseases, automobile
<br>
accidents, gunshot wounds, etc.
<br>
<p>A fundamental principle, spoken by a Rabbi at the Templeton
<br>
Foundation &quot;Extended Life, Eternal life&quot; conference,
<br>
&quot;Life is GOOD.  Death is bad.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; shouldn't we try to enhance beyond the human state?
</em><br>
<p>I may not understand this part of the question.  I believe that
<br>
enhancing beyond the currently evolved human state is what
<br>
we are heading towards.  The difference is that in the past
<br>
the evolution was done by natural selection, in the future
<br>
it will be done by design and intent.  The problem is that
<br>
people have never had this capability before so it scares
<br>
some people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What do you think will happen to people's identity as 'humans' once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they have been so integrated with technology that they physically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no longer resemble the human bodily form?
</em><br>
<p>We *are* already integrated with the pre-evolved technology,
<br>
so you have to mean &quot;engineered&quot; technology.  Further you have
<br>
to imply that &quot;engineered&quot; technology would somehow make us
<br>
appear &quot;different&quot; from the way we appear now.  Engineereed
<br>
technology does not have to necessarily make us look different.
<br>
I could completely replace my bio-brain with a much better nanobot
<br>
derived brain and still have the same geeky look I have today.
<br>
I suspect you will see women making much more radical alterations
<br>
to their appearances than men, because they are either genetically
<br>
wired to do so and/or have much greater societal training for that.
<br>
<p>Now, assuming you mean that people evolve in the direction
<br>
of radically different appearances, one thing that may be
<br>
needed is some brain engineering to dampen our fight-or-flight
<br>
response and/or &quot;tribal&quot; instincts.  As people become increasingly
<br>
different those deeply rooted emotional survival strategies
<br>
are likely to be less benificial, perhaps even becoming harmful.
<br>
You don't want people crashing their cars because a human who
<br>
has adopted the form of a gorilla jumps out into the middle
<br>
of the street.  A fully engineered &quot;nanobody&quot; can certainly
<br>
withstand the impact of a moderately fast automobile, so the
<br>
presumably adolescent, &quot;human&quot; can probably do this relatively
<br>
fearlessly just to jerk around the car driver.  Not unlike
<br>
behaviors you see today where teenagers driving by in cars will
<br>
unexpectedly scream at a pedestrian just to make them jump.
<br>
<p>There may need to be some legal or societal restrictions
<br>
placed on the modifications you are allowed to make to
<br>
oneself if only for reasons of public safety.  An alternative
<br>
would be the developement of &quot;zones&quot; where specific
<br>
modifications were permitted (and so can crank up
<br>
the volume on your way to the nightclub).
<br>
<p>People's pre-programmed concept of &quot;humans&quot; which presumably
<br>
is linked to a number of pre-wired brain &quot;features&quot; -- face
<br>
recognition, hard-wired emotional expressions, nurturing triggers,
<br>
companionship needs, soothing voices, etc. is going to have to
<br>
expand (A LOT!).
<br>
<p>We might, in the long run speciate into a number of new and
<br>
different species adapted to certain specific environmental
<br>
niches.  But my money is on everyone deciding to upload.
<br>
At that point appearance is entirely virtual and therefore
<br>
serves only as a form of entertainment.  You can explore
<br>
the world of &quot;avatars&quot; to see what that is like.
<br>
<p>For an interesting view of what humans are, one of the
<br>
finest I've ever seen, see Ka-Ping Lee's explanation:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://web.lfw.org/shad/augment.html">http://web.lfw.org/shad/augment.html</a>
<br>
which is part of his documentation on his &quot;Shad Valley&quot; experience.

Hope that helps,
<br>
