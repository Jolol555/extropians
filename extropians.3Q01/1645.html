<p>I have to agree with Damien. For similar reasons, I've boycotted all the
<br>
Star Trek, Star Wars, and assorted Fantasy series that take up so much
<br>
space at the book stores. I've even read the store managers down for not
<br>
just having the bad taste and ignorance to mix SF and Fantasy, but of
<br>
including these garbage series to begin with. Doing so demonstrates that
<br>
there is nobody who actually READS running the bookstore, that its just
<br>
some bean counting floozy in corporate HQ deciding what to send based on
<br>
what deal they get bribed with by the publishers...
<br>
<p>For example, I have not seen a single work by Damien Broderick on store
<br>
shelves around here since I bought _The White Abacus_ 4 years ago or so.
<br>
Its difficult to find Egan and many other more skilled writers. Card is
<br>
the exception though, he does get shelf space, though generally much
<br>
more for his fantasy novels than for his SF.
