This got longish, almost like a kind of FAQ. Maybe it could be reworked
<br>
into something like that?

<p>I am an European (swede); I'm not certain of the percentage of europeans

on this list, but I know we are a few. There are other local lists like
<br>
exi-euro for more local matters too.
<br>
<p>The question is what you mean by european philosophy. Extropianism
<br>
builds on western philosophy, which has until recent centuries been
<br>
largely european. You can trace a line from the pre-socratics through
<br>
the big three Greeks (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle) to the renaissance
<br>
humanism to the enlightenment and onward to transhumanism. If you are
<br>
referring more specifically to modern european philosophy like
<br>
analytical philosophy or continental-style poststructuralism I guess Max
<br>
may answer the question of how much they influenced the extropian
<br>
principles better than me, but their impact doesn't seem that strong. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How will the transhumanist movement deal with people's fears: the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; change how people are or will people have to do that for themselves? 
</em><br>
<p>Technology is a tool for change: it does not change who people are by
<br>
itself but only when applied by people for achieving whatever they want.
<br>
If people change how they are, it will be because they seek to do it and
<br>
are enabled by technology.
<br>
<p>As for dealing with fears, I think we have to move beyond merely
<br>
rationally showing that certain technologies and possibilities are
<br>
possible, beneficial and safe. That is of course important, but in order
<br>
to truly overcome fear we need to show how they can be integrated in
<br>
human life, to show they ethical and humanistic importance.

<em>&gt; The degree of optimism on this list concerning the future is

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>True. But that people no longer blindly trust claims of utopia tomorrow
<br>
only means that we have to demonstrate benefits and a philosophy more
<br>
clearly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The egg heads (no offense intended) have been saying that technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will solve this and that and remove this and that for centuries now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Technology has indeed developed the cures for many diseases and
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will what most people get out of a time and technology that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce diamond houses cheaply be a diamond bullet in the head? If not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why?
</em><br>
<p>If you look at the long term changes in the human condition over the
<br>
last centuries it seems very clear that technology - including social
<br>
technologies such as free trade and democracy - has actually improved
<br>
the human lot quite a bit in terms of life expectancy, freedom, material
<br>
standard, availability of information and education etc. This is not
<br>
just focused to a small group (which is how many people believe it is)
<br>
but an ever broader part of mankind. At present *3 billion* people are
<br>
living in nations that are moving from third world standards to first
<br>
world standards! While the exponential growth of technology/economy
<br>
means that the leading edge of people are moving away from the tailing
<br>
edge of people, free trade seems to be able to help developing nations
<br>
grow faster than first world nations (Sachs, Warner: &quot;Economic reform
<br>
and the process of global integration&quot;, Brookings Papers on Economic
<br>
Activity, 1995 no. 1) which would actually lessen the division. 
<br>
<p>Radical technologies like nanotechnology are likely to at least fix many
<br>
aspects of material poverty fairly easily. Real poverty (measured in
<br>
terms of lack of money, even if diamond skyscrapers are cheap) may of
<br>
course remain, but that is something that can and should be solved
<br>
politically, economically and culturally - it is not a purely
<br>
technological issue. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Will Transhumanism become a sort of super technocratic society in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which technologists develop technology only for themselves or can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others join? Will it be the third word that matches: aristocracy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racism.......... transhumanism?
</em><br>
<p>Transhumanism is strongly connected to the humanist ideas of
<br>
human self-determination, rationality, freedom and democracy. This
<br>
means that the closed elite scenario you sketch is anathema to the core
<br>
of transhumanism. People are welcome to join - or chose not to change.
<br>
This negative right is also important to remember, since many ideologies
<br>
claim theirs is the only way and that everybody must eventually join
<br>
into their project. From a transhumanist point of view there is no
<br>
problem even if very many people chose not to self-transform, as long as
<br>
neither group interferes with the other. 
<br>
<p>Also, such a closed scenario would be highly inefficient from a
<br>
transhumanist point of view. If we on this list were the super-rich
<br>
techno-elite, only we would be customers for our toys. Hence they would
<br>
be very expensive, wasting our resources. But if you have a market of
<br>
billions, then the technology gets cheap. Many people want improvements,
<br>
and the total brainpower involved in the project increases tremendously.
<br>
<p>Of course, even the most enlightened idea can become warped when
<br>
implemented in practice by groups of fallible humans subject to all the
<br>
problems of group think and other social psychology problems,
<br>
corrupting biases such as those described in public
<br>
choice theory and especially the dangers of turning living discourse
<br>
into rigid ideology. Transhumanism could become something other than it
<br>
is intended, just as (say) the romantic movement led to many destructive
<br>
ideologies. But this is something we have to deal with on the way, I
<br>
don't think transhumanism is more likely than other ideas to turn bad
<br>
over time. 
<br>
<p>There are of course people calling themselves transhumanists who don't
<br>
get it, too. This may be a harder problem: there is a huge spread of
<br>
views among transhumanists and no strict definition of who is
<br>
transhumanist or not. There may be a real danger that a fringe group
<br>
calling itself transhumanist grows malign, or does things in the name of
<br>
transhumanism abhorrent to the core transhumanist values.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; After all this biotech superman thing is basically a child of National
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Socialism. Sure, now one can in theory claim that with gene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulation even defectives CAN be healed. WILL they be healed?
</em><br>
<p>It should be noted that the idea of improving humanity biologically is
<br>
far, far older than national socialism. It is expressed in the Gilgamesh
<br>
epic (3000 BC) and the various taoist doctrines of China. 
<br>
<p>Perhaps more important than the question of whether defectives will be
<br>
healed is the question who decides who is defective and what is to be
<br>
done? The collectivist answer (the government and its appointed
<br>
organisations) has led to atrocities. The transhumanist answer would
<br>
instead be that it is up to people themselves (and in the case of
<br>
children, possibly the parents). Nobody should be forced to change, just
<br>
as nobody should in principle be prevented from changing. 
<br>
<p>(I'm right now finishing a paper on morphological freedom, the right to
<br>
modify one's body. One of the central implications of this freedom as
<br>
well as the right to one's body is that it is up to me to decide whether
<br>
I allow a change to my body or not)
<br>
<p>Issues of healthcare systems and allocation of course remains to be
<br>
hashed out; they depend very much on local economical systems,
<br>
availability of resources and what cultures are around. Messy, real
<br>
political questions. But once some core values have been defined they
<br>
can at least be solved to some extent. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are the words can and should synonyms?
</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Over the time (years) that I have been a member of this list I have,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from time to time, noticed what I (perhaps wrongly) interpret to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disdain for poor/uneducated/less intelligent people in many postings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so I wonder  Will everybody get a better body or will there be a races
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of super humans and slave race that serve them?
</em><br>
<p>The disdain might be one of the less endearing effects of a closed
<br>
debating environment with a fairly narrow (and self-supporting) list
<br>
membership; the typical in-group, out-group behavior we see in most
<br>
human group. It doesn't really fit in with transhumanist values. I think
<br>
that if transhumanists got into debates outwards with society more
<br>
often, these group effects would lessen. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is to stop Transhumanism from becoming the scientific arm of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future dictatorships?
</em><br>
<p>One simple hinder is unfortunately credibility: at present the
<br>
credibility of transhumanism is very low, so a dictatorship would find
<br>
many far more credible groups (unfortunately) willing to be its
<br>
scientific arm. 
<br>
<p>More seriously, the best way to avoid this is to remember the core
<br>
values of transhumanism and integrate them in the transhumanist debate
<br>
and presentation: without core values transhumanism is just enthusiasm
<br>
for cool transformative technology. If transhumanism remains true to its
<br>
humanist values it would become a most uncomfortable arm for any
<br>
dictatorship. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can Libertarianism be summed up like this: all the freedom, justice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health and life that money can buy. If so how does that change things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the way they are now?
</em><br>
<p>Money and free trade is IMHO not really a core part of libertarianism,
<br>
it is rather a corrolary to acknowledging the rights to life, freedom
<br>
and property (all necessary for human flourishing). See for example
<br>
Tibor R Machan's _The Freedom Philosophy_ (1987 Timbro) for one
<br>
derivation of the legitimacy of free trade from an essentially
<br>
aristotelian framework.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Is or will Transhumanism be nothing more than intellectual confusion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral imbecility, and willful ugliness elaborated into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-conscious ideology: the worship of wealth, power, novelty and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machinery? Will it become the ultimate expression of what many call a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture less and materialist America: a sort of burger and coke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion?
</em><br>
<p>Only if the internal debate forgets what it is about. Which is of course
<br>
a real danger for any ideology or system of thought.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Must Transhumanism demand spiritual pathology. Obviously not since Mr.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Broderick seems to allow for something else, as it were, but how many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumans can make allowances for that which they cannot see?
</em><br>
<p>Did you really mean pathology?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For me the ends justify the means but it seems that in Transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the means is the end. Is this a fair judgment?
</em><br>
<p>To my knowledge nobody has analysed whether transhumanism best works
<br>
with a consequence ethics or some other system.  But if you take into
<br>
account not just the ends but also the consequences of the means it
<br>
seems you get a much more workable system than just looking at the ends.
<br>
<p>I think there is a problem that means often are more philosophically and
<br>
technologically interesting than ends - they are often interesting, can
<br>
be analysed technologically etc, while the ends are just boring old
<br>
ethics, so the debate tends to be drawn towards the means while
<br>
forgetting the ends.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are those who say that Libertarians and individualists are most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to be solely concerned with their own egotistical and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Narcissistic gratification. Since there are a few here on the list I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask would you refute this claim and how/why?
</em><br>
<p>Even when seen from a purely self-interested point of view altruism and
<br>
social interactions with other are beneficial. This is not just
<br>
reciprocity, but also due to the fact that humans are social creatures
<br>
who enjoy each other's company and experience empathy and sympathy. Even
<br>
if one doesn't acknowledge any inherent value in these interactions,
<br>
they are still good for the individual.
<br>
<p>Libertarians are humans. Something many critics seem to forget. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How would a Transhumanist egalitarian/collectivist effort express
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself? Would they go for a Borg type society as in Star Trekk?
</em><br>
<p>Either that or some form of technocracy. In the later case of course a
<br>
lot of the core ideas have to be warped. In the former case I think they
<br>
could be retained; some people might decide to voluntarily form
<br>
borganisms. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why not find ways of extending the use of our already existing brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of making new ones? If the mind can work outside of the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body why go for any form of containment at all? Is it possible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist without limits?
</em><br>
<p>Why go for a single solution? Transhumanism is far broader than having
<br>
everybody working on a single Extropically Correct solution; if one
<br>
approach that previously was thought to be flawed or useless shows
<br>
promise or results, people will begin to investigate/invest in it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since our instincts and emotions are our driving forces if we insulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves from them or get rid of them what will our motivating force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be?
</em><br>
<p>None. But we can refine them, turn them from the current somewhat
<br>
oldfashioned survival tools into something that promotes human
<br>
flourishing to a far larger level. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Are people in general in greater danger of being mistreated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumans/extropians than, white people are of being mistreated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negroes?
</em><br>
<p>In what situation? This all depends on the kind of society you have, and
<br>
this is something that can be affected by our decisions rather than
<br>
being seen as predetermined by the current state of transhumanism. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In attempting to become more than human will we become less?
</em><br>
<p>The human drive to become more have IMHO so far made us far more. Self
<br>
actualization is an expanding process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Don't get me wrong. I'm not against science and technology. I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; install a bionic leg today if I could -_-  It's just that I have lived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of my life in what you would call primitive circumstances and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have taken a long time to learn about all the different stuff you guys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk about here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In reading up I have found questions which have bothered me but I did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not want to trouble you all with my lack of knowledge/understanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However since some people on this list seriously wanted to discuss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether or not white people are nicer than black people I figured that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my questions won't be the most stupid ever brought up on the list.
</em><br>
<p>I must admit that I got a bit irritated when I first read your
<br>
questions, and I still don't like the tone of many of them. But I think
<br>
you are right in that these issues need to be brought up. My answers are
<br>
in some sense all the same answer: &quot;Back to basics: transhumanism will
<br>
only work if we have a workable system of values, and the
<br>
liberal/humanist values extropianism is based on seem to be such a
<br>
workable system&quot;.
