Mike said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;For example, a recent court case actually said that these 'risky zip' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;policies are racist, and court cases have also ruled that banks that make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;loan decisions (especially for mortgages and cars) even partly on zip code 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the customer are practicing racism.
</em><br>
<p><p>Here we'd say that such a policy may (depending on the precise facts) amount 
<br>
to unlawful indirect discrimination. That is not the same thing as racism.
<br>
<p>Actually, I'd expect it to be a very unpopular policy anyway. Isn't there an 
<br>
outcry against the relevant bank every time such a thing happens? A bank 
<br>
that was caught doing such a thing here (I'm not saying they don't do it; I 
<br>
said &quot;caught&quot;) would have a public relations disaster on its hands.
<br>
<p>Anyway, as I said in an earlier post, the concept of racism always needs to 
<br>
be unpacked carefully in any serious intellectual discourse. Likewise for 
<br>
related but different concepts such as discrimination, prejudice, 
<br>
intolerance, etc. (I realise that Jerry, you and others have been trying to 
<br>
do this.) I very seldom use the word &quot;racism&quot; at all, except for people who 
<br>
display extreme race-based hatred or contempt, because there is usually a 
<br>
better alternative with a more precise legal or ordinary language meaning.
<br>
<p>Russell (one of whose hats is that of a lawyer who has a practice defending 
<br>
discrimination claims)
