From: &quot;Lee Corbin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20Extropian%20Religious%20War--thank%20you&In-Reply-To=&lt;00ad01c10a34$ea211ba0$7d5d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; I agree with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you and not J. R. when he wrote something to the effect of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;all those who affirm religious beliefs are either liars
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or idiots&quot;.  But I think that we often greatly underestimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the number of those to which that DOES apply (here &quot;idiot&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning someone who is pretty stupidly buying a lot of crap).
</em><br>
<p>An example of someone who affirms religious belief while not being a liar or a
<br>
fool is (thank you for allowing me to see) someone who feels personally
<br>
benefitted by religiosity. Therefore, I'd amend my previous statement such
<br>
that anyone who truly believes in religiosity is a liar, a fool, or a
<br>
pyschological cripple. Or, as Jessie Ventura reportedly said, &quot;Religion is for
<br>
weak-minded people&quot; (which statement ignores liars and categorical idiots).
<br>
Ventura's statement roughly approximates saying that eyeglasses are for folks
<br>
with weak vision. This does not demean such people, it merely describes
<br>
(accurately) the function of their eyewear.
<br>
<p>I've heard some people argue that we should not try to restore the sight of
<br>
certain blind artists, such as Stevie Wonder or Ray Charles, because if they
<br>
could see, their creative talent may be diminished. In fact a few blind
<br>
artists have themselves argued that they would not be what they are if they
<br>
could see.
<br>
<p>Certain deaf people have also contended that they would be impaired more by
<br>
being excluded from the company of their deaf peers and friends (note that) if
<br>
they could hear. Of course that might seem selfish, but then there's nothing
<br>
wrong with well-directed selfishness.
<br>
<p>If religiosity provides the cognitive crutch that some people need in order to
<br>
do their best, then that's fine. Debunking religiosity doesn't require us to
<br>
demean those who need and use religion in private. It does, however, prompt me
<br>
to praise those who have managed to rise above it, and to admonish those who
<br>
would pretend religiosity is an asset rather than a liability for those who do
<br>
_not_ need it.
<br>
<p>To summarize: religiosity is an asset for those who need it, and a liability
<br>
for those who do not. I think that for those who need it to suggest that those
<br>
who don't need it should nevertheless embrace it, is an ugly position to take.
<br>
Just because I need eyeglasses to see well doesn't give me the right to
<br>
chastise people who work toward ending all impaired vision.
<br>
<p>In a world full of cognitive cripples, it seems everyone hates the
<br>
able-brained (or denies their existence).
<br>
<p>[on blocking senders]
<br>
<em>&gt; What I don't understand is why they have to announce it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That seems a might peculiar.  Probably they only want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offend and insult the party that annoyed them.
</em><br>
<p>Or perhaps it's a modicum of courtesy to other list members who may
<br>
(otherwise) wonder why the offending party's messages are no longer being
<br>
engaged. In effect, announcing it says to the whole list: My lack of response
<br>
is not to be misconstrued as inability to rejoin, but rather as refusal to
<br>
feed the troll.
<br>
<p>©¿©¬
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
