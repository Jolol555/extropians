Samantha quoted me as saying
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Isn't this [ie reference to a religion of Scientism] a bit of a cliche? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's one regularly trotted out by religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; apologists and by humanist sentimentalists about religion.
</em><br>
<p>and went on to say after a &lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;I don't apologize for religion/spirituality and I am not in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least sentimental about it.  I also don't dismiss it and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;especially not as lightly as seems fashionable around these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parts of late.
</em><br>
<p>I have no idea what brought this on, Samantha. Nothing I said in response to 
<br>
Party of Citizens was an attack on you or even referred to you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And, in case you're tempted to retort that cliches usually contain a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of truth (which I accept), most of us who admire the advancement of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do *not* treat it as a religion. We favour rational inquiry into nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; through methods such as observation, experiment, mathematical modelling,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; formal logic, hypothetico-deductive reasoning. The conclusions we come 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are provisional. Where the more precise methods of science break down, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; still favour rational techniques such as logic and consilience, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;methods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of philosophy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is not what is meant by the term &quot;scientism&quot;.  The above is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mostly simply science.  I don't think &quot;consilience&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sufficient or well enough known to cover the rest.  Nor is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philsophy restricted to logic and consilience alone.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't say this. I said &quot;such as&quot;. BTW, if my referrence to consilience 
<br>
arguments is obscure to anyone (and it does *not* appear to have thrown 
<br>
Samantha - I'm not saying that), have a look at Michael Ruse's excellent and 
<br>
very fair book _Can a Darwinian be a Christian_ (Cambridge Univ. Press, 
<br>
2001), p. 13 where he explains how consilience of inductions is a primary 
<br>
form of argument in historical sciences where there is less emphasis on 
<br>
experiments. I'd say that the same applies to philosophy.
<br>
<p>I think I'd better stop at this point, rather than enter into a line by line 
<br>
rebuttal, or I'll escalate the current religion war which, whatever part I 
<br>
may have played in sparking off, I have consistently tried to calm down. 
<br>
Indeed, Samantha, I consistently tried to avoid offending you in particular, 
<br>
knowing your views about spirituality etc.
<br>
<p>However, the aggressive attack on supposed &quot;scientism&quot; by Party of Citizens 
<br>
- and the hackneyed claims about a scientistic &quot;religion&quot; - demanded a clear 
<br>
rebuttal.
<br>
<p>Russ who is still prepared to be conciliatory to allies
