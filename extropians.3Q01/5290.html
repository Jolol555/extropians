<p>&quot;The Sacramento Bee is running this story about the first powered device
<br>
to achieve &quot;hypersonic&quot; speeds in the Earth's atmosphere. In a series of
<br>
DARPA-sponsored tests, at Arnold Air Force Base in Tennessee, a scramjet
<br>
engine, encased in a titanium projectile, was fired from a 130-foot
<br>
cannon, at an initial velocity of Mach 7.1. The scramjet's engines then
<br>
ignited, and the object moved another 260 feet, in just 30 milliseconds,
<br>
before it came to rest in a series of steel plates designed to halt the
<br>
flight. Peak acceleration: about 10,000 G's. Elapsed time, including
<br>
cigarettes &amp; pillowtalk: less than a second. PS: According to this nifty
<br>
page at NASA, Mach 7.1 is about 5406 MPH, whereas 260 ft, per 0.03
<br>
seconds, is about 5909 MPH.&quot;

<p>Defense agency tests hypersonic
<br>
missile prototype
<br>
<p>By Andrew Bridges
<br>
Associated Press Writer
<br>
<p>LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A futuristic jet-powered missile prototype reached
<br>
speeds of more than 5,000 mph in recent tests, a Defense Department agency
<br>
announced Monday.
<br>
<p>The test marked the first time a specialized jet engine, called a
<br>
scramjet, propelled a projectile at hypersonic velocities, or faster than
<br>
five times the speed of sound, said Preston Carter of the Defense Advanced
<br>
Research Projects Agency.
<br>
<p>&quot;No one has ever gotten positive thrust out of a scramjet vehicle in
<br>
free-flight,&quot; said Carter, a program manager in DARPA's Tactical
<br>
Technology Office. DARPA is spending about $800,000 on the project.
<br>
<p>During the June 20 test at Arnold Air Force Base in Tennessee, the
<br>
cylindrical missile prototype was fired from a 130-foot cannon at a
<br>
velocity of Mach 7.1, or about 5,325 mph. The scramjet engine aboard the
<br>
titanium projectile then ignited, propelling it 260 feet in 30
<br>
milliseconds.
<br>
<p>The prototype, which resembles a gothic spire and measures just 4 inches
<br>
in diameter, was destroyed when it punched through a series of steel
<br>
plates designed to halt the flight.
<br>
<p>The test was successfully repeated on July 26, reaching the same peak
<br>
acceleration of about 10,000 G's. High-speed video and still cameras, as
<br>
well as X-ray and infrared cameras, recorded the flights.
<br>
<p>Scramjets, or supersonic combustion ramjets, burn hydrocarbon fuel but
<br>
scoop oxygen out of the atmosphere to combust it. Rockets can reach
<br>
comparable speeds, but must carry the fuel and an oxidant to burn it,
<br>
leaving less room for payload.
<br>
<p>The Pentagon and National Aeronautics and Space Administration are both
<br>
studying scramjet technology since it would allow missiles or spacecraft
<br>
to travel longer distances and carry larger payloads than rockets.
<br>
<p>NASA attempted to test its own scramjet, the X-43A, on June 2, but blew up
<br>
the rocket used to launch the unmanned jet because it began to break apart
<br>
and stray off course. The explosion also destroyed the experimental jet.
<br>
<p>X-43A tests will likely resume late next year, NASA spokeswoman Leslie
<br>
Williams said.
