<p>
This was a very fine June, in many ways.  Certainly the best Father's
<br>
Day and birthday presents I can remember.
<br>
<p>For Father's Day, I got to go to Extro 5.  'Nuff said!
<br>
<p>A few days after I returned, it was my birthday.  My teenage daughter 
<br>
had quite a surprise for me.  For years, she had bemoaned the fact that
<br>
she had only modest funds available for a present, and was hard-pressed
<br>
to come up with a gift I'd appreciate that I wouldn't have already
<br>
just gotten for myself.
<br>
<p>This year she realized that she didn't have to rely solely on her own
<br>
resources.  She secretly orchestrated a conspiracy among my friends and
<br>
family for a collective gift she was sure I'd like, and then presented
<br>
it to me with flair:  a trip to Space Camp.
<br>
<p>Not a bad week....
<br>
<p>So now I have to plan the details.  Has anyone been, and has advice on
<br>
how to make the most of it?  What else should I do while I am in that
<br>
corner of the country, besides try to wangle a press or VIP pass to
<br>
a shuttle launch?  And any of you to visit? 
<br>
<p><p>-- David.
