<em>&gt;From: &quot;Lee Corbin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=RE:%20Vicious%20Racism%20was%20RE:%20Reparations&In-Reply-To=&lt;F34EHLB8TrBHxvZ9aZ100000507@hotmail.com&gt;">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Sean Kenny and Zero Powers evidently believe that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certain &quot;Mr Lorry&quot; posted the Fred Reed essay, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at least one of them &quot;plonked&quot; someone over a year
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now for their information, our frequent poster Mike
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lorrey did *not* post that piece.  It was J.R. Molloy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who did so.  Can we at least try to keep people here
</em><br>
<em>&gt;straight?;  It might be easier without so much loud
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and boastful &quot;plonking&quot; by so many parties.
</em><br>
<p>Well, while we're getting things &quot;straight&quot; *I* knew who posted the Reed 
<br>
piece.  I read it.  Had Lorry posted I wouldn't have seen it.  I assumed 
<br>
from Kenny's post that Lorry had taken the silliness and run with it (as, I 
<br>
recall, he is wont to do).
<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
