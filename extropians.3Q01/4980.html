My favorite IQ story happened to a friend of mine who's name is David. 
<br>
Back in
<br>
the late 60's David was a student in Philadelphia looking for a summer
<br>
job in
<br>
the publishing industry.  The odds of finding such a job at the time
<br>
were very
<br>
small, but David was a determined young lad, so he hit the pavement and
<br>
started
<br>
knocking on doors.
<br>
<p>One day, David went to a company where he was told (as usual) that there
<br>
were no
<br>
openings.  David asked to apply anyway, just in case.  So they gave him
<br>
an
<br>
application, which included a 50 question flash IQ test to be completed
<br>
in only
<br>
3 minutes.  To their complete shock, David returned the test to the HR
<br>
people in
<br>
1 and 1/2 minutes with all 50 questioned answered.  They asked him
<br>
&quot;Don't you
<br>
want to check your answers while you still have time?&quot; and he replied
<br>
&quot;No, they
<br>
are all done, and they are all correct.&quot;  When they graded the test they
<br>
found
<br>
that they were all correct, and figured that he was some kind of boy
<br>
genus, so
<br>
they hired him for the summer thinking that, surely there was something
<br>
really
<br>
good he could do for them.  And he did, and all ended very well, but
<br>
what the HR
<br>
people did not know was that David had taken that same test 6 times in
<br>
the
<br>
previous 4 days.
<br>
<p>Another true story I found important was a case history of prefrontal
<br>
brain
<br>
damage in one of William Calvin's books.  The patient was a intelligent
<br>
lawyer
<br>
with a big firm, but after his injury, he just was unable to do anything
<br>
productive.  The key point is that they tested his IQ after the injury
<br>
and found
<br>
that it was just the same as before.  This shows that it is possible for
<br>
IQ to
<br>
be useless if not supported by other stuff going on in the brain, and
<br>
indicates
<br>
that for a given individual (n=1) IQ may have no predictive value. 
<br>
History is
<br>
full of cases of people who could solve puzzles if you sat them down and
<br>
stuck
<br>
the puzzle under their noses, but otherwise were lost to the world.
<br>
<p>A few years ago I decided to try out some IQ tests to see how I scored. 
<br>
I did
<br>
pretty well, but not as well as I had expected.  So, I looked carefully
<br>
at the
<br>
design of the tests (these were general population tests) and at the
<br>
kinds of
<br>
errors I was making.  I found that I had three problem areas; the first
<br>
was
<br>
anagrams.  All the tests had anagrams which my brain just would not do. 
<br>
I was
<br>
never interested in them in the first place, having a hard enough time
<br>
with
<br>
spelling in general, and considered the entire subject stupid because
<br>
you can
<br>
solve them easily by putting the letters in alphabetical order and
<br>
looking up
<br>
the equivalence group in an anagram dictionary.  Why learn what you can
<br>
do in a
<br>
lookup?  Well, to get a higher score on these stupid tests, that's why. 
<br>
So I
<br>
did.  As a side benefit, I can now play Scrabble with my family.
<br>
<p>The second problem I had was with logic.  That came as a big surprise to
<br>
me
<br>
because I was an A student in mathematical logic in college, and had all
<br>
these
<br>
years of designing logic circuits and writing computer code.  The
<br>
problem was
<br>
that I was using very precise mathematical logic to answer questions
<br>
that were
<br>
being put to the general population.  So, I would be too picky and
<br>
answer &quot;none
<br>
of the above&quot; when one of the answers was mostly correct but had flaws
<br>
(i.e. if
<br>
you designed circuits or wrote code that way your plane would crash, but
<br>
so
<br>
what).  Therefore, I learned to ask myself &quot;How would a logical person
<br>
who is
<br>
not technical answer this question?&quot; and got them all after that.
<br>
<p>The last problem was similar, but more subtle.  Sometimes when given the
<br>
usual A
<br>
is to B as C is to __ question I would see the simple relationship and
<br>
then see
<br>
a deeper connection that indicated a different answer.  At first I was
<br>
troubled
<br>
thinking that this was a trap for people jumping to conclusions, and I
<br>
was not
<br>
going to fall for it.  Wrong, I was finding stuff that was not there. 
<br>
The
<br>
answer was to just give the simple first thing out.
<br>
<p>I mentioned all of the above because making these simple changes in the
<br>
way I
<br>
was taking the tests added 20 points to my IQ.  This was an artifact of
<br>
the
<br>
general population tests; perhaps this happened to Feynman.  When I
<br>
looked at
<br>
some of the &quot;high difficulty&quot; tests, none of the above problems
<br>
existed.  This
<br>
has led me to &quot;Ken's Theory of General IQ Tests&quot;  which goes like this:
<br>
<p>If you submit a group of progressively more mentally capable people to
<br>
general
<br>
IQ testing you will see that the IQ goes up with capability for a bit
<br>
after 100,
<br>
but then levels off, or even starts going down.  This is the point where
<br>
the
<br>
people are smarter then the test writers.  Then after a bit more, the
<br>
scores
<br>
will start going up again.  This is the point were the people know that
<br>
they are
<br>
smarter than the test writers, and start feeding the test &quot;what it
<br>
wants.&quot;  I
<br>
suspect that if you keep going you will get to a total drop off because
<br>
you hit
<br>
a population so smart they refuse to take the test at all, or use it for
<br>
scratch
<br>
paper while thinking about their own projects.
<br>
<p>My view is that, except for some special cases in children where you can
<br>
use IQ
<br>
to tell who needs special help, IQ is bunk, especially in adults.  Adult
<br>
brains
<br>
have many different modules that think about things in different ways. 
<br>
It is a
<br>
multidimensional space that cannot be mapped on a simple Gaussian
<br>
distribution,
<br>
although many tiny functions, individually, can be.  J. R., put it on
<br>
the list.
