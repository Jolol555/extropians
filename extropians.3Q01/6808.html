There are a few problems with this.
<br>
<p>It takes a single generation to change a society beyond recognition. If the 
<br>
people of Afganistan were liberated and went back to being a more 
<br>
westernised country like they seem to have been before the fundamentalist 
<br>
bullies dug in over there, then a single generation (25 years) could see 
<br>
them becoming one of the greater forces for good on the planet. As an 
<br>
example I believe Ireland's biggest export today is software. Who would 
<br>
have thought it a bare 20 or 30 years ago?
<br>
<p>Another problem is the fact that the terrorists have dispersed to at least 
<br>
20 countries around the planet. Like the Alien movies, if we cut the 
<br>
monster its blood will cause us much death and destruction.
<br>
<p>Even worse is that if we take a lawless attitude then the opposition to us 
<br>
grows rather than lessens.
<br>
<p>Lastly, life enhancing solutions are vastly superior to bloody ones. In 
<br>
this particular case I think *only* life enhancing ones can work. I think 
<br>
in this situation death and destruction will simply be magnified by more 
<br>
death and destruction. There are some cases where force and death can be 
<br>
justified and even be the only solution, but I don't think this is one of them.
<br>
<p>That said, as Robert notes, it is useful to dispassionately consider *all* 
<br>
paths... even if they lead to mortifying conclusions. Then we can get a 
<br>
proper perspective on what should really be done.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Those of us who believe in the extropian/transhumanist perspectives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expect that the world is likely to undergo a significant adjustment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of its perspective over the next 10-30 years.  These will include
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such developments as artificial intelligence, molecular nanotechnology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the elimination of aging and death and the feasibility of uploading
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our minds into much more robust hardware.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We also know, from calculations that I and Eliezer (independently)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have done, that the annual cost between where we are now and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;full manifestation of what we expect is feasible is of the order
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of 50 million lives per year.  That is approximately 10,000 times
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the number of lives lost in the WTC attacks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;According to the CIA world fact book, the population of Afganistan
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is ~25 million people.  In contrast the population of the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is 280+ million people and the world is 6+ billion.  It is highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unlikely that the population of Afganistan will make a significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contribution to the development of the advanced technological era
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we expect.  In fact their ongoing existence seems likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;directed towards negatively impacting that development.  To the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extent that the activities of individuals in Afganistan, or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;support of such individuals by the leaders or population at large
</em><br>
<em>&gt;delay the development of the era we anticipate, we can assign
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a cost to it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From my perspective the analysis is relatively simple.  If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;population of Afganistan, or the people supported by them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;delay the onset of an era of advanced technological capabilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by 6 months or more, the value of their lives is negative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From a rational position, *if* the case can be made that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Afgani position &amp; politics is likely to result in the diversion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of resources and delay the development of the technologies we anticipate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;developing by more than 6 months, then a plan of genocide to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bury the country in rubble seems justified.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Is this feasible?  It would appear to be the case.  100 Minutemann III
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ICBMs could launch 300+ Ktons each at Afganistan.  This roughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;translates to over 1 ton TNT/person.  While this is unlikely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kill everyone, it is likely to knock the population back to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sub-cave-person level and make a large negative impact on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feasibility of staging terrorist activities from that country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of course the downside will be in the likelyhood that it may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in promoting individuals and countries in developing similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capabilities.  But of course once the line has been crossed, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are relatively few barriers towards the use of nuclear weapons to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continue knocking down potential terrorists as needs require.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
