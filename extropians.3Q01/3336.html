<em>&gt; &gt; I believe that [Fred Reed's essay] violates many of the list

<em>&gt; Oh great.  Here we have an issue that taxes the emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control and objectivity even of extropians and... sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough, someone wants to ban it.  Do you not wonder then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that people want to ban cloning and everything else that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>What makes you think we don't have better things to do than have
<br>
our emotional control and objectivity taxed at the moment? Do
<br>
you
<br>
really think that no one would want to forgo things like the
<br>
original
<br>
post on here for some other reason beyond just being
<br>
unconfortable? 
<br>
Where is your objectivity when it comes to a balanced view of
<br>
your
<br>
list siblings?  Are you the pot calling the kettle black when it
<br>
comes to failing in objectivity and assuming the worse about
<br>
others
<br>
when they don't want to play?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The worst thing that I can say about the act of *posting*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such an  article is that it is in poor taste insofar as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many of the lurkers are concerned.  (I'll defend that thesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some other time.)  But for extropians, it is obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly what is needed, and the 800 lurkers have to gear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up to the level of perspicacious analysis plain speaking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that often occurs here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You might believe it is exactly waht is needed but many here
<br>
disagree.  I think that it is a pretty ham-fisted way of
<br>
exploring
<br>
the problems of objectivity in discussions if that is your
<br>
primary purpose.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we cannot learn how to be objective and calm with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas that disturb *us*, then how are we to approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; telling others about Jupiter brains, uploading, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the singularity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>One can be utterly objective and calm and still say, &quot;I am not
<br>
interested in discussing thus and such subject right now or in
<br>
endless analysis of the motivations and sub-motivations of what
<br>
made the discussion to date what it was or was not.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nonsense.  This is yet another symptom of the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are made very uncomfortable by the possibility that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while not literally correct, the essay delves into &quot;areas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that people were not meant to discuss&quot;.   One instance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the reposting was done as a rather humorous comeback
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to someone who had written
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Lee, you need a vacation.  Seriously.  Nothing is more boringly
<br>
needlesome than a rehash of a contentious disagreement.
