<em>&gt; &gt; I:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a) lost out on an appointment to a military academy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So did I... West Point.  I had the highest SAT scores
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the State of Washington that year too.  It wasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an ethnic minority that got my slot, however, it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another white male who just happen to be a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; student and athlete than me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Few slots, many applicants.  How do you know an ethnic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minority got a slot which would have been yours?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe you lost out because there were simply other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people more qualified than you?
</em><br>
<p>Because:
<br>
a) I had the highest SATs that year of all applicants
<br>
b) those nominees who got the appointments were a female and a black
<br>
male
<br>
c) the academies rejected my nomination not on any grounds of my own
<br>
unfitness, but because my older brother had asthma (in their health
<br>
forms, they ask &quot;have you or any member of your family ever had:&quot;. When
<br>
I disputed their rejection on that grounds, they sent specs for one of
<br>
those treadmill tests, only requiring me to inhale a specified chemical
<br>
before the test, which my doctor knew caused asthma attacks in 99% of
<br>
the population. Thus, they rigged the test to eliminate me as a
<br>
candidate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; b) lost out on financial aid in college, which was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; biased to provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more aid to people of the same economic level if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they were minorities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did you get your education anyway... despite losing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out on financial aid?  Do you think it's possible that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of those black students might not have gotten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their educations at all if they had lost out?
</em><br>
<p>My parents had to pay full boat for my education, which I did not and
<br>
could not afford to finish due to the expenses of a back injury. With
<br>
three other siblings, they could only afford to send me for a year
<br>
unless I obtained financial aid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; c) am constantly accused of being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; racist/sexist/'rich elite' simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because I am a white male.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think it's simply because you are a white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; male... But more because you say things like &quot;am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constantly accused of being a racist/sexist/'rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elite' simply because I am a white male.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like I said, I was a white male... and I never got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accused of being racist (or sexist, for that matter).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you are constantly being accused of being racist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe you should take a look at your words and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions.  It isn't just because you are a white male.
</em><br>
<p>Irrespective of my words and actions, which anyone objective enough on
<br>
this list would understand are not racist, sexist, and I have certainly
<br>
never been part of the 'rich elite'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In my experience, the only lack of opportunity that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; blacks I've known have had has been produced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their own memetic programming, and not by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the system. When you are programmed to expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; racism, that is exactly what you will get.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Racism is caused by the people being discriminated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against, simply becuase they believe it exists?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You didn't really just say that, did you?
</em><br>
<p>No, that is NOT what I said, so stop putting words in my mouth like you
<br>
folks usually do.
<br>
<p>I have met my share of bigots, who have shared their opinions with me
<br>
thinking that I feel the same way because I'm white and male and
<br>
individualistic, so I won't deny that it exists.
<br>
<p>I have known, worked, and lived with many black people, and I have
<br>
always found situations where some blacks present or observing
<br>
automatically cry 'racism', while others are far more objective. Many
<br>
are also able to discriminate between bigotry from ignorance and bigotry
<br>
from intent. I see it all the time when I visit my jewish cousin up in
<br>
Maine. His fellow students who are natives of northern Maine really
<br>
don't know what is and is not rude behavior with respect to jews.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your being discriminated against is real... their's is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all in their heads?
</em><br>
<p>No. The discrimination against myself for my white maleness is
<br>
institutional, a statutory part of the bureaucracy. Discrimination, real
<br>
and perceived, against blacks today is generally a matter of systemic
<br>
and cultural perception.
<br>
<p>For example, mail order businesses that won't deliver to zip codes with
<br>
high fraud and theft rates are not being racist, though the result of
<br>
their actions is systemic blanket discrimination against those living in
<br>
those zip codes due to the actions of a few. Individuals living within
<br>
those zip codes must work on an individual basis, and undergo individual
<br>
credit checks (or provide credit reports), as well as have their methods
<br>
of payment restricted, for example, to credit cards that are billed to
<br>
the addresses the products are delivered to.
<br>
<p>This is part of the whole trust problem I've been writing about in the
<br>
past.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Mike... I have no trouble at all believing you are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good person who would never engage in overt acts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discrimination... but you have deluded yourself if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that blacks bring it all on themselves... and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is statements like that which result in you being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called racist... it has nothing to do with the color
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your skin.
</em><br>
<p>When I was in basic training, every black fellow who dropped out of
<br>
training did so claiming 'racism', despite our three DI's being black
<br>
and hispanic and female, respectively. Those fellows who stuck with it
<br>
laughed at such insinuations as cop outs. I have seen these sorts of
<br>
situations FAR more frequently than actual incidents of discrimination.
<br>
A large amount of the poor opinion of blacks that I have seen in whites
<br>
is that far too many blacks live down to the stereotypes that whites
<br>
have, and thereby hurt all.
<br>
<p>I do not say that discrimination against blacks doesn't exist. I have
<br>
fought against it myself, and my fighting against it is likely why my
<br>
'voluntary out' discharge from the Air Force mysteriously materialized
<br>
despite my not having asked for it, since I had been in the process of
<br>
reporting to the EEOC offices about the new First Sergeant in my
<br>
squadron, who I had found out in his last assignment (in Logistics) had
<br>
sent 94% of the people on base put through the Correctional Custody
<br>
program on base in the last year, and of the 48 enlistees that made up
<br>
those, all were either black, hispanic, or female.
