<p><p>Your guess is mostly correct; I am far more familiar with this than I want
<br>
to be.
<br>
<p>About a year ago I was in a position to get an &quot;inside track&quot; with a Very
<br>
Senior MS Exec.  I have been aware of their core business strategy for a
<br>
year now, and I thought it was pretty disturbing at the time, but events
<br>
make it timely to actually mention it for the purpose of discussion.
<br>
Normally, I don't like starting idiotic MS arguments, because I don't care
<br>
about them.  
<br>
<p>It goes like this:
<br>
<p>They do not care about Windows.  They do not care about Office.  These are
<br>
disposable and are being used as straw men for the activists (Linux, DoJ,
<br>
etc).  For the last few years, their one and only goal has been to become
<br>
*THE* mediator of all content world-wide.  They have never anticipated being
<br>
in the commodity software business forever.  It has taken several years of
<br>
very slick strategic maneuvering to put themselves in a position to make
<br>
this happen, all without anyone really noticing how things were being set
<br>
up.
<br>
<p>Many people complain about the &quot;Microsoft tax&quot; on personal computers.
<br>
Peanuts.  If they get their way, you will *literally* be paying a fee to MS
<br>
for every transfer of information or content, and in many different forms of
<br>
media.  This isn't my interpretation, but the way it was actually explained
<br>
to me. Their core corporate strategy is to control all access to all
<br>
information by everyone, and to charge you for the privilege.
<br>
<p>A year ago, I didn't see how it could come together so I filed it away for
<br>
future reference, but I am getting a bad feeling that I *am* seeing it come
<br>
together, even if it doesn't have Microsoft's explicit stamp on it.
<br>
<p>That said, I have to grudgingly admire the sheer magnitude of evil genius it
<br>
takes to have the balls to attempt something so extreme.  I don't like it,
<br>
but it *is* impressive.
