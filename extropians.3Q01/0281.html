</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From Reuters,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010704/ts/food_starlink_dc_1.html">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010704/ts/food_starlink_dc_1.html</a>

<p>This greatly disturbs me, and could be a setback to the food industry and GM
<br>
foods in general.
<br>
<p>StarLink corn was banned for human use, yet it was discovered in many human
<br>
products.  It is a form of yellow corn, but now is being found in white corn
<br>
products.  This makes it clear that we cannot keep contaminated products out
<br>
of our food.  Even industry officials say that there is no way they can keep
<br>
different kinds of corn separate.  Many industries actually switched to
<br>
white corn to avoid using StarLink corn, and it still ends up in the food.
<br>
This demonstrates the industry's inability to follow laws or safety
<br>
procedures to keep contaminates out of food.  If anyone does develop a
<br>
really dangerous strain of food, it would appear that we would be unable to
<br>
keep it out of the general food supply.  This needs to be fixed and
<br>
addressed if we want to continue developing GM foods in a safe manner.
<br>
<p>I am also disturbed by the way this problem was discovered.  A Florida
<br>
person who had already had a bad reaction to StarLink corn in yellow-corn
<br>
products had the same symptoms when he ate the white-corn products.  He
<br>
deliberately switched to white-corn products to avoid StarLink, and
<br>
reportedly had no way to guess that white-corn could ever contain StarLink.
<br>
He says that he recognized the side-effect symptoms as being the same, and
<br>
he notified the FDA who confirmed the presence of StarLink.  This seems to
<br>
demonstrate that the side-effects of StarLink are real and not imagined.  It
<br>
also is very bad PR if GM food is seen as being detectable by the health
<br>
problems of consumers who eat them.
<br>
<p>If GM foods are to continue to be a viable technology, we must be able to
<br>
control it so that we decide whether it goes into our food or not.  We also
<br>
need better tests to detect side-effects.  The industry insisted that there
<br>
were no side-effects, and that reported effects were imagined, but here we
<br>
have a serious counter-example.  These kind of events are going to be the
<br>
deciding factor for most consumers.  Scientific tests, studies and
<br>
explanations simply cannot compete with customer experiences in these areas.
<br>
In a battle of memes, the anti-GM factions have won this round.
