I went to see the movie &quot;Memento&quot; yesterday.  This one is terrific.  Given that we
<br>
have had several reviews in a row crying about lack of plot, cry no more.  This is
<br>
the most original idea I have seen in years.  It has been out in the art theaters
<br>
for a few months.  I saw the trailer when it first hit town, but thought it would
<br>
probably be dumb.  Then I noticed that it has been packing them in the same place
<br>
for months, so I decided to go see it.
<br>
<p>The story is about a guy who suffered brain damage during an attack in his home
<br>
that resulted in the murder of this wife.  His injury has left him without the
<br>
ability to form long term memory.  In the movie he explains that he has a loss of
<br>
short term memory, but actually he has good short term memory, and access to all
<br>
his long term memory before the injury, he just cannot make new long term memory,
<br>
so everything from the murder to a few minutes ago is gone.  Anyway, his mission
<br>
in life (such as it is) is to track down and kill whoever murdered his wife.
<br>
<p>In order to give the viewer a feel for what life is like for this guy, the cuts in
<br>
the movie are run in reverse order, so you start by seeing the end and work your
<br>
way backwards.  This way, the audience cannot use memory of earlier events to
<br>
figure out what is going to happen.  You sit there with perfect &quot;memory&quot; of the
<br>
future, but have to keep guessing what you are about to see that has come before.
<br>
There are many great plot twists, but given that this is shown backwards, you see
<br>
them as plot untwists.  The best of these is right at the beginning, which you see
<br>
last.  So I will not spoil it for you by telling how it starts.
<br>
<p>Many deep philosophical issues are kicked around in this movie.  I am sure most
<br>
movie goers will enjoy it without notice, however, I think folks on this list will
<br>
come away with plenty of things to think about.
<br>
