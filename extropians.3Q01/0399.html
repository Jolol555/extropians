<em>&gt; I suppose, although I hate to pigeonhole myself into
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; my father spend more time with his projects at work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than at home (by necessity--he would have rather been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with us), then having his projects canned just before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completion. What was it all for, designing automation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machinery then having it all thrown out so the company
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could purchase the same thing elsewhere for *more*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money?
</em><br>
<p>Hey, that's not something to complain about. He got paid by the  man to
<br>
have absolutely no impact on the company's performance? I'd say he got
<br>
out ahead.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He worked for Chrysler. I can't look at the cars from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1975 to 1985 and see what it was all for. They took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his life in exchange for the smallest wage the UAW
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would let them get away with, and gave his family
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing but a small discount on a substandard,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overpriced vehicle with lousy (okay, antagonistic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downright mean) customer service.  Transhumanists, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask you--what price for a huge section of the sweet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pie of one's life?
</em><br>
<p>I've learned that choosing to have dependents when one is not
<br>
financially independent is just asking for trouble.
