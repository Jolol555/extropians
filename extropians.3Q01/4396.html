<p>
I'm not sure about how much others here have been involved in
<br>
fundraising and mass marketing campaigns, so I thought I'd post info
<br>
I've gleaned from my own experiences, not working for fund raising
<br>
groups, but for the companies that they subcontract their work to.
<br>
<p>It's All In The Donor List
<br>
<p>The most important asset to any organization that exists as a result of
<br>
fund raising is the donor list. This list can have two main
<br>
characteristics: institutional or individual. 
<br>
<p>An institutional donor list is a list of groups, institutions,
<br>
corporations, etc that share, in whole or in part, the agenda of the
<br>
fund raising organization and donate funds to support this agenda. While
<br>
the advantage of such a list is that it's generally easier to build such
<br>
a list, and to raise more money from fewer sources in this manner, it
<br>
causes the fund raising organization to become a rather narrow 'special
<br>
interest'. If the names on the list are predominately for-profit
<br>
corporations, then you are an 'industry group' whose agenda is always
<br>
suspect (i.e. The Tobacco Institute, for example).
<br>
<p>How do you build such a list? Simple: contact industry and interest
<br>
groups and rent their membership lists, doing name pulls based on
<br>
various demographics they have on the members. Do a mailing to their
<br>
member corporations and organizations, soliciting their membership in
<br>
your group and/or support for your groups planned activities. Once
<br>
you've developed an initial list of members/donors, try the hold-outs
<br>
after your group has actually accomplished some objective, to prove
<br>
you're to be taken seriously.
<br>
<p>An individual donor list is a list of individuals, real people, who
<br>
share your groups' agenda, in whole or in part. While it is more
<br>
expensive, generally, to build such a list, depending more on such
<br>
donors allows the group to present itself as a 'broad based, grassroots'
<br>
movement that is working 'in the public interest'. You build such a list
<br>
by renting lists from other like-minded groups, from magazines which are
<br>
of a sort your market research indicates that people sympathetic to your
<br>
cause subscribe to. In our case, these would be science and technology
<br>
magazines, engineering and scientific organizations. You want them to
<br>
pull only names of individuals who make a certain amount of money each
<br>
year (for fundraising lists only), or who have donated x dollars to
<br>
other groups, unless you are simply interested in building membership.
<br>
If you are looking to build an organization of grassroots volunteers, to
<br>
stage rallies and protests, you want to target students, in high school
<br>
and college.
<br>
<p>Once you've rented a number of lists for a number of sources, you send
<br>
these lists to a list processor (like Datamann) who will remove
<br>
duplicate names (and keep records of how many and which were duplicates,
<br>
since people who subscribe to many magazines tend to have more
<br>
disposable income), then they'll correct any bad addresses, and sort the
<br>
list for postal rate optimization.
<br>
<p>Another thing you can do is to also rent names from sources who do NOT
<br>
support your agenda, but which may have members/subscribers that overlap
<br>
your other lists, and use these to deselect some people on your
<br>
candidate lists. For example, someone who subscribes to Genetic
<br>
Engineering Monthly AND the PETA Cute And Fuzzy Newsletter is not likely
<br>
to be entirely sympathetic and therefore not a good candidate. Do this
<br>
after your dedupe step above.
<br>
<p>This process develops your intitial list of candidate donors for your
<br>
intitial mailings. Those that reply to your initial mailings become your
<br>
real individual donor list.
<br>
<p>By repeating this process on an annual basis, and using raised funds to
<br>
pay for ever larger list rentals to cover more of the population, you
<br>
can grow an organization up from nothing in a rather quick amount of
<br>
time. Having an individual donor list is more reliable in the long term
<br>
as well, than an institutional list. Institutions are far more demanding
<br>
of real action, and far more capricious about directing their money
<br>
toward those that provide real results. For instance, a large percentage
<br>
of businesses in America who do political donations don't care what
<br>
party they donate to, they just donate to the incumbent if they are
<br>
getting their way, and to challengers if the incumbents have a habit of
<br>
kneecapping them.
<br>
<p>Food For Thought:
<br>
<p>While Democrats raised lots of money during the Clinton years, much of
<br>
it came in big chunks generated because of presidential glitter rather
<br>
than any permanent expansion of the Democrats' donor base. Now, the
<br>
first challenge is to raise enough to remain competetive without the
<br>
glamour of the presidency.
<br>
Terry McAuliffe, Chairman of the DNC, boasts that the national committee
<br>
raised #23.5 million in the first six months of the year - a record for
<br>
the period following a presidential election. Mor of the  money raised
<br>
was in small and limited 'hard money' donations that can be used
<br>
directly in campaigns than in large and unlimited 'soft money' which
<br>
cannot be used directly for candidates.
<br>
Worse, McAuliffe has to deal with the fact that the GOP riased twice as
<br>
much during the same period, and actually depended less on the big
<br>
soft-money donations the Democrats say they want to ban.
<br>
<p>The underlying problem for Democrats is that they rely on a donor base
<br>
that is smaller and significantly older than the GOP donor base, which
<br>
reflects its aging baby boomer core support. The GOP has been doing far
<br>
more donor recruitment in the last 20 years than the Democrats have.
<br>
McAuliffe is trying to build an improved donor mailing list, &quot;The first
<br>
guy I talk to in the morning is my direct-mail guy, and the last guy I
<br>
talk to at night is the direct-mail guy.&quot;
<br>
<p>Chicken And Egg: Activism or Fundraising?
<br>
<p>Lets face it: activism is a big money business, and requires lots of
<br>
money to run on a nationwide or worldwide basis, no matter how 'grass
<br>
roots' it is. Recruiting your footsoldiers from the ranks of the
<br>
universities and video game couches of the US is expensive, because you
<br>
need to target them with more expensive forms of advertising: TV,
<br>
Magazines, and Telemarketing, etc. are all needed to get people to go to
<br>
your website, and without these funnelling avenues, it doesn't matter
<br>
how cool your website is, as so many dotcoms discovered. You need
<br>
spokespersons, which can cost lots of money or not. You need to print
<br>
LOTS of promotional material from signs, buttons, and tshirts to flyers
<br>
and post cards, and you need to get this material out to regional
<br>
offices that help coordinate with local chapters.
<br>
<p>Of course, without some means of showing you are serious, its a little
<br>
hard to raise funds without pointing to any accomplishments. This is
<br>
where your core group (us extropes) need to organize to stage some high
<br>
profile events that initiate positive action that ignores opposition
<br>
groups. A 'Clone-in', for example, where a group of geneticists and
<br>
activists wilfully disobey an unconstitutional anti-cloning law. A 'seed
<br>
liberation' demonstration, where we wilfully mix GMO foods with non-GMO
<br>
foods, or spread GMO seeds freely in the wild, so that humanity enjoys
<br>
their benefits and cannot avoid them. Stage a 'cyborg rights rally', or
<br>
build a shrine to the Americans with Disabilities Act (which I think
<br>
will be of paramount importance to augmentation in the future).
<br>
<p>Once some high profile event or two has been staged, the group can say:
<br>
&quot;Look, we are serious, we are organized, and we get exposure and
<br>
accomplish results, give us money.&quot;
