Subject: Rioting all over the shop, was NEWS: Genoa Riots
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;The interesting point is that most of the youths that rioted claimed that
</em><br>
they were defending themselves from the BNP troublemakers and that the
<br>
police had attacked the rioters first and with great brutality.  Exactly how
<br>
the rioters were defending themselves from racist thugs that were over 200
<br>
miles away (tucked up safe and sound in bed, in London) escapes me.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My point is (sorry it took so long getting there) that there seems to be a
</em><br>
group present in western society that consists of young men (in their teens
<br>
to their mid twenties) that live to cause trouble, they thrive on violence
<br>
and hatred and really do not care who is on the recieving end of it. For
<br>
instance, the greater part of damage done in Bradford was to asian
<br>
businesses by asian rioters.
<br>
<p>I think this is true - but what is new? Large collections of young men have
<br>
been causing problems in human societies since the year dot. Clearly there
<br>
are specific factors which can trigger trouble in any specific case but
<br>
behind all of these is the more general phenomenon of young adult males who
<br>
find mayhem exciting and fun. (Matthew Parris had a godd piece making this
<br>
point in The Times a few days ago).
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How can we create a brighter future for mankind in general when such people
</em><br>
exist? How can we channel their rage into something constructive? A lot of
<br>
discussion on the list is to do with technology solving problems of the
<br>
flesh (death, disease, limited intelligence/physical skills).  Can anyone
<br>
think of ways in which such technology could be turned upon the violent
<br>
sections of society to change violence into something constructive.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I don't think technology itself is the solution to problems of this sort.
<br>
It's rather a matter of social institutions. Most human societies have
<br>
mechanisms which 'tame'  young men and integrate them into adult society. In
<br>
many places today these have broken down. In the case of the community
<br>
involved in these riots that breakdown has happened very recently (within
<br>
the last ten years I would say), for a number of reasons. Young British men
<br>
of Pakistani origin used to have a recorded crime rate lower than the
<br>
British average. It's at the average level or above it now. You are right
<br>
though that the existence of this kind of social problem has big knock-on
<br>
effects, not least in public policy.Steve Davies
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I can only see technology helping here through education.  I am doing a
</em><br>
years work placement at a school/public computer centre and the reaction of
<br>
some of the kids to the high tech look of the centre makes teaching them a
<br>
lot easier, but there are still those trouble makers who refuse to behave.
<br>
Unfortunately I saw more than one of the troublemakers from the school I'm
<br>
working at on the TV, in the midst of the riots, throwing bricks at cops.
<br>
<p><p>Maybe one move would be to not force them to attend full time education?
