</em><br>
<p>Are you telling me we aren't now?
<br>
<p>Glibness aside, let me make two points. One I didn't say these kids
<br>
should not receive an education, but simply that their parents
<br>
should bear the bulk of the cost, you pay for your choices, this is
<br>
free markets 101.
<br>
<p>Second, actually I have an interest in them being ignorant and
<br>
therefore noncompetitive economically, but I ignore the economics
<br>
in this case and insist they be educated on humanistic grounds, and
<br>
I am willing to pay a portion of the cost.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Because investment in human capital is one of the more secure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;investments you can make?
</em><br>
<p>What investment? They aren't mine.
<br>
<p>If you followed my post we would all pay a portion of education,
<br>
but the parents would pay the bulk of it. This makes it in their
<br>
economic best interest to limit the number of children to those
<br>
they can afford.
<br>
<p>As I pointed out above, those of us without children are
<br>
essentially subsidizing our competitors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Because we all have an interest in the propagation of the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;race (or civilization, if you prefer to think in those terms) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parents shouldn't have to foot the entire cost themselves?
</em><br>
<p>As I've stated twice already parents wouldn't be paying the entire
<br>
amount, just the bulk of it, and for reasons I've already outlined.
<br>
<p>And exactly what interest do I have in the propagation of the human
<br>
race? (I know, but do you?)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Is being in school all year necessarily best for the kids?
</em><br>
<p>This is a good question, everyone needs a vacation.
