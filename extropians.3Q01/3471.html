</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Needless to say, insulting terms like &quot;droogies&quot; or whatever,

</em><br>
<p>Lee, Joe's alleged 'mailbomb campaign' was the same episode which I
<br>
described a few weeks ago, in which both Greg Burch and Max More agreed
<br>
with my recall of events. Where each person Joe disagreed with may have
<br>
sent a few or a few dozen messages, Joe took it upon himself to reply
<br>
repeatedly to EVERY person who posted something about firearms ownership
<br>
he disagreed with, and persisted in slandering each person's sanity,
<br>
criminality, manhood, sexuality, etc. If ANYONE here operated a mailbomb
<br>
campaign, it was Joe, which I think you will find the majority of this
<br>
list in agreement with me on.
