Subject: [HAYEK-L:] Path dependence, lock in, etc., and social behavior in
<br>
general
<br>
<p><p>With regard to such terms as expectations, path dependency, lock in,
<br>
knowledge, remedial, cooperation, and efficiency as discussed on this
<br>
list regarding Peter Lewin's seminar, list members may be interested
<br>
in how these terms can be related to cooperative and conflict
<br>
behavior in general, especially within Hayek's spontaneous society.
<br>
<p>Briefly, we can conceive of the spontaneous society as invisibly tied
<br>
together by nested, overlapping, and multivaried balances of
<br>
expectations between individuals, individuals and organizations as
<br>
Hayek defined them, and organizations themselves. These diverse
<br>
expectations form equilibriums, structures of expectations that are
<br>
social contracts between members of the society. It is a lock in of
<br>
their mutual behavior over a determinate future.
<br>
<p>How does a specific social contract come about? Through conflict.
<br>
Now, conflict is a confrontation of interests, capabilities to
<br>
exercise power of one kind or another (powers such as exchange,
<br>
intellectual, love, coercion, authoritative, manipulative, etc), and
<br>
the will to do so. Conflict behavior is a knowledge exchange, a
<br>
learning process through which people and groups redetermine their
<br>
expectations of each other's interests, capabilities, and will. This
<br>
then establishes the social contract, which is based on an
<br>
appreciation through conflict of what each other wants, can get, and
<br>
is willing to do. This appreciation I will call a balance of powers.
<br>
Note that this balance and the particular expectations it supports
<br>
are specific and unique to the parties in terms of their values,
<br>
meanings, and norms. There is no concept of efficiency that is
<br>
relevant--the structure of expectations, the social contract, is what
<br>
each is satisfied with, given their reading of each other, regardless
<br>
of whether a third party interprets the contract to be unjust or
<br>
unfair, or one that could be better in some economic sense.
<br>
<p>But expectations have high psychological and social viscosity. A
<br>
structure of expectations then will change slowly and incrementally,
<br>
but the supporting balance of powers--the interests, capabilities,
<br>
and wills of the parties--may change more quickly. This means that a
<br>
gap may form between a structure of expectations--who gets what,
<br>
when, and how--and the supporting balance of interests, capabilities,
<br>
and wills. Tension and friction then can result that like an
<br>
explosive gas, only needs a spark--a trigger event--to disrupt the
<br>
structure of expectations, and cause conflict.
<br>
<p>This transition from one structure of expectations to another is
<br>
usually a jump--a discontinuity--in social behavior (which causes no
<br>
little problem for the use of continuous quantitative measures). That
<br>
is to say that major changes between parties in an spontaneous
<br>
society are not continuous, not a smooth evolution, but are leaps
<br>
through conflict to new expectations, like the apparent stability of
<br>
the earth is punctuated by sudden earth quaking movements in the
<br>
earth's crust.
<br>
<p>Within this social framework and the spontaneous society, conflict is
<br>
then both a mechanism for rebalancing expectations and an empirical
<br>
indicator that expectations have broken down, Through conflict the
<br>
parties renegotiate their expectations and determine a simultaneous
<br>
solution to their different equations of interests, capabilities, and
<br>
wills.
<br>
<p>The new structure of expectations established through conflict,
<br>
however, will only last until again the new balance of powers becomes
<br>
incongruent with expectations and a new conflict erupts. Social
<br>
cooperation and conflict are thus a social process (not a cycle)
<br>
through different but related episodes of cooperation and conflict as
<br>
people learn from and adjust to each other. As this process moves
<br>
through cooperation and conflict, the parties gain in new knowledge
<br>
and mutual learning from each conflict and the resulting
<br>
expectations, it will wind upward in more durable and harmonious
<br>
cooperation and less intense and extended conflict (like the process
<br>
of a marriage, from the conflict filled first year to the more
<br>
peaceful later years that become well structured by the empirical
<br>
expectations each had developed of the other). This process I call a
<br>
conflict helix.
<br>
<p>This is path dependent sequence of changes (history matters) in which
<br>
chance can play a large role, as in the trigger event that sets off a
<br>
conflict. Whether the dependency is first, second, or third degree
<br>
depends on the actors and the situation. Indeed, in many situations a
<br>
third degree dependency may by itself be the factor in the breakdown
<br>
of the expectations and resulting conflict. The breakdown then
<br>
enables a party to change the perceived inferior who gets what, when,
<br>
and how to what was previously more desirable, but had to be given up
<br>
in the former conflict.
<br>
<p>[Path dependence is when certain contingent events have an impact in the way
<br>
an economic process unfolds.  For instance, the fact that someone invested
<br>
lot of money in a medical degree influences other decisions in their life,
<br>
such as what job to take and the like.  First degree path dependence is just
<br>
the observation that there's persistence in human affairs -- or history
<br>
matters.  Someone might, for instance, remark that since she grew up in such
<br>
and such a neighborhood, she learned to love Thai food.  It implies nothing
<br>
bad or regretful about the contingent event.  She's not regretting her not
<br>
having grown up exposed to some other cuisine.  Second degree path
<br>
dependence is when, in hindsight, someone admits to having made the wrong
<br>
choice, but they didn't know it at the time.  This is like going into a Thai
<br>
restaurant, already knowing she loves Thai food, then finding out the food
<br>
there isn't all that great.  She regrets her mistake, but this is only after
<br>
the fact.  When deciding to eat there, she thought she was making a good
<br>
decision.  Third degree path dependence is when someone makes an inferior
<br>
decision knowingly.  This is when someone feels locked into a bad decision.
<br>
Some question whether this last type even exists -- or if it does, what its
<br>
implications are.  -- Daniel Ust, using Peter Lewin's &quot;The Market Process
<br>
and the Economics of QWERTY: Two Views,&quot; _The Review of Austrian Economics_
<br>
14(1) as my reference.  See his paper for more references on path
<br>
dependence.]
<br>
<p>This universal social process towards grater cooperation and less
<br>
conflict depends on the vital conditions of a relationship remaining
<br>
unchanged in important respects (as such conditions would change
<br>
significantly through a new job, a sharp jump in product costs,
<br>
acquiring a degree, a discovered affair, coup, election,
<br>
assassination, joining the nuclear club, defeat in battle by a third
<br>
party, etc.). A wife's new Ph.D., for example, may radically change
<br>
her balance of interests, capabilities, and will regarding her
<br>
corporate executive husband; or a Marxist coup in Saudi Arabia could
<br>
suddenly and radically change its balance of powers with the United
<br>
States, leaving their mutual structure of expectations hanging in
<br>
air--without a base in congruent mutual interests and wills.
<br>
<p>In sum, social behavior within a structure of expectations has no
<br>
room for the idea of efficiency, but path dependency, lock in,
<br>
expectations, and bargaining (exchange power)-the dominant power in a
<br>
spontaneous society--are very much part of the social picture.
<br>
<p>I have modeled and tested the path dependency and jump from one
<br>
social contract to another by Catastrophe Theory at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/CAT.ART.HTM">http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/CAT.ART.HTM</a>
<br>
<p>This theory formed the basis of my volumes on Understanding Conflict
<br>
and War, particularly War, Power Peace at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE13.HTM">http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE13.HTM</a>
<br>
<p>It is this theory and its successful empirical tests that underlie my
<br>
assertion that freedom is a method of nonviolence, and that nations
<br>
largely comprising a spontaneous society do not make war on each
<br>
other.
