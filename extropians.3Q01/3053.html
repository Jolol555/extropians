</em><br>
<p>Extropians, I'm sure, take this as a compliment, and rightfully so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not saying it's possible, but it might be.  Unfortunately, this
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; under discussion to be actually on the list.
</em><br>
<p>???  Why is that?  What is the absolute necessity of that, when
<br>
our goal is accurate understanding (finding the truth)?  Are 
<br>
you implying that people of different ethnicities, or races,
<br>
or points of view have separate truths?  Are you claiming, for
<br>
example, that you cannot efficiently strive for an understanding
<br>
of, oh, say racism, without consulting racists?
<br>
<p>Now, logically, in some cases &quot;outside&quot; help is so enlightening
<br>
that it seems almost indispensable.  If we wanted to understand
<br>
a race of alien beings, for example, failing to have any in the
<br>
discussion would be quite a handicap.  But people of different
<br>
races from yours are hardly alien beings.
