<em>&gt; Which is probably why the clip was played over and over again... or maybe
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; am wording that wrongly. I should probably say that the viewers were
</em><br>
played
<br>
<em>&gt; by those that screened the tape of those kids. It was guaranteed to get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nasty reaction. It almost certainly was not representative. So, why do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think they showed it?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it was.  The EXTREMELY left-wing, pro-Palestinian Pacifica radio
<br>
network reported this morning through their man on the ground that the
<br>
celebrations were widespread.  Further the story is now breaking that
<br>
Arafat's people tried very hard to confiscate the video records, because
<br>
they knew it would undermine the public face they are showing to the West.
