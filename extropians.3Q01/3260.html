<em>&gt; &gt;It is a never-ending source of amazement that bright people can make the

<em>&gt; &gt;clearly you say it, someone will misunderstand it.

<em>&gt;   I used to be a member of Mensa, an organisation where even the village

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; boasted about how crazy &quot;it&quot; was. In short lots of people showed up who

</em><br>
<p>Did these people actually show membership cards or were they just

loiterers?
<br>
<p>Although in one respect, I have to agree with you: I've never met so
<br>
many idiots as those on the mensa usenet groups.

<p><em>&gt;   This experience forced me to make a clear distinction between IQ and

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Doug, I suggest you check this out first. Panhandling flourishes
<br>
wherever one can make more from it than being a day laborer, and I've
<br>
never found a person holding a 'will work for food' sign who was
<br>
actually interested in working. Someone with 10 extra common sense
<br>
points would see through this con.
