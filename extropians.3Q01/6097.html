<p><p>Living in a major city isn't the problem; there are many major cities that
<br>
are invisible as far as being a target goes.  Living in a city that has a
<br>
symbolic connection to the essence of being an American (from an external
<br>
perspective) is a different story.
<br>
<p>That said, I've considered certain cities to be a growing risk factor for
<br>
some time.  I don't want to become a statistic merely for living in the
<br>
wrong place, and as the weapons get bigger and cheaper the less safe those
<br>
places become.
<br>
<p>There are many large cities in the U.S. that have relatively high profiles
<br>
to Americans but which totally drop of the radar if you leave the country.
<br>
These cities should be quite safe from something like this, and would be a
<br>
minimal sacrifice if you are worried about such things.  If you are worried
<br>
about full-scale nuclear war (improbable), move to a more rural setting that
<br>
is proximal to a small city.
