FW: THE LIGHTHOUSE: August 20, 2001THE RISKS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION?
<br>
&nbsp;from THE LIGHTHOUSE &quot;Enlightening Ideas for Public Policy...&quot; Vol. 3, Issue
<br>
33 August 20, 2001
<br>
<p>Environmental regulations are often touted as necessary to counter
<br>
potential harms caused by the risky byproducts of industrial
<br>
production. However, the saga of MTBE -- a fuel additive used to
<br>
reduce air pollution -- highlights the hazards of our current
<br>
approach to environmental protection.
<br>
<p>Most analysts considered MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) to be
<br>
relatively safe when its use in gasoline was promoted by the 1990
<br>
amendments to the Clean Air Act. Today, the risks of MTBE, now a
<br>
suspected human carcinogen, are well publicized, as communities
<br>
across the country have shut down drinking water wells that have
<br>
shown evidence of MTBE contamination.
<br>
<p>Did the risk of harm from air pollution justify the use of risky
<br>
MTBE? Certainly not in California, which already required a
<br>
cleaner-burning gasoline mix. Here, the addition of MTBE under the
<br>
one-size-fits-all Clean Air Act amendments increased overall health
<br>
risks.
<br>
<p>Most disturbing, we now know that industry and government knew of
<br>
MTBE's health risks even before the 1990 amendments. Given the
<br>
adversarial approach fostered by our command-and-control
<br>
environmental regulations, it is understandable, if highly
<br>
regrettable, that industry would cover-up any knowledge of MTBE's
<br>
health risks. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, however, is
<br>
directed to promote environmental protection. Yet, newly released
<br>
internal documents show that the EPA knew of MTBE's health risks as
<br>
far back as 1987.
<br>
<p>The proponents of more government regulation often tout the
<br>
&quot;precautionary principle,&quot; assuming that the only risks come from not
<br>
addressing a perceived problem. This episode, however, demonstrates
<br>
that environmental regulations can create risks too.
<br>
<p>Doubtless, regulators and industry will conduct intense efforts to
<br>
spin the MTBE story in their favor. Regulators will argue that
<br>
industry withheld knowledge of MTBE toxicity and leakage; industry
<br>
will argue that MTBE was perfectly legal and encouraged under the
<br>
Clean Air Act. Each will blame the other with good cause.
<br>
<p>Rather than waste more ink, time and -- potentially -- lives, what
<br>
they should do is look for ways to move from an adversarial
<br>
regulatory environment that rewards legal maneuvering to a system
<br>
that rewards responsibility.
<br>
<p>Might we suggest that we start with a return to the common law?
