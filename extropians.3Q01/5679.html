</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Several options spring to mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For starters, do they take insane people? Most armies don't. If you can

</em><br>
<em>&gt; like crazy.
</em><br>
<p>Crazy is a good dodge: you can always be cured, and you may need to go
<br>
overseas to be cured...
<br>
<p>A saying I recall from the military: &quot;There's four ways out besides
<br>
discharge: you've gotta be crazy, queer, commie, or comatose.&quot; Of the
<br>
four, I'd say crazy is the easiest dodge (unless you are already
<br>
bi/curious). I don't know how they treat commies in Singapore, or
<br>
whether that's an excuse to not serve, but if its not harmful to your
<br>
health but is a dodge, that's another good way out, you can always
<br>
change your opinions later.
<br>
<p>Your primary problem, though, is that compulsory military service is not
<br>
considered 'repression' in the world of asylum. You won't get much play
<br>
from most countries on that dodge, especially since Singapore is not at
<br>
war with anybody at the moment. If you can conveniently get one started,
<br>
I hear that Canada is a fine place to avoid the draft.
<br>
<p>But I think you are thinking about escaping all wrong. Defecting isn't a
<br>
tourist experience. It's not supposed to be easy. You don't get to just
<br>
go up to a counter and say &quot;I'd like two tickets out of the country
<br>
ASAP, please.&quot; In order to get the proper defection experience, you need
<br>
to stow away: on a boat, a plane, etc. You need fake papers, a new
<br>
identity that makes you as either too young or old enough to have
<br>
already done your 2.5 years of service.
<br>
<p>Last but not least: If you like living in Singapore otherwise, and are
<br>
otherwise proud of your country, serve your time. Inconvenience is a
<br>
rather piss poor excuse to not serve out a relatively short hitch in a
<br>
military that has not gone to war in decades. You may feel that your
<br>
country is not worth dying for, but I'm sure there is something in your
<br>
life that you do feel that much attachement to: family, friends, the
<br>
corner sushi bar, whatever. We all have one thing that truly matters.
<br>
Let that be your reason for serving.
