James Rogers writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Generally, if people aren't willing to defend their property and lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against an invading force, then those things weren't worth defending in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first place.
</em><br>
<p>It is seldom so simple as &quot;the people&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Forcing people to do anything for any purpose is a giant red
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flag that what you are trying to do is violating a central tenet of value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economics.
</em><br>
<p>Very, very true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The War for Independence in the United States was accomplished
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in large part because ordinary people decided it was a worthwhile cause for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which they were willing to expend substantial effort and put their lives at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substantial risk.  And that wasn't a fight against an evil invading force,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was a mere petition for independence.
</em><br>
<p>For what it's worth, about one-third of the free people of the
<br>
colonies were patriots, one-third were tories, and one-third
<br>
didn't care.  The assets of known tories were often seized
<br>
during the revolution.  (I'm not expressing any opinion about that.)
