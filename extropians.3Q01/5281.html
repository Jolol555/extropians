<p>Wired is somewhat after their times; the first experiments with brain
<br>
pacemakers were done in the 70's. Although it is cheering to see that
<br>
functional electric stimulation of this kind has now been approved.
<br>
<p>I somewhat disagree with the claim in the article that Parkinson's,
<br>
depression, OCD and tinnitus are really the same disease because they
<br>
all seem to involve neurons getting caught in rhythmical activity. That
<br>
is a bit like saying the common cold and brain tumors are the same
<br>
because they both give you headaches. In some of the above cases the
<br>
problem might indeed be that you develop an undesirable attractor state
<br>
in the neural dynamics, but in other cases these rhythms are simply the
<br>
result of dysregulation or as in the case of Parkinson, the death of
<br>
certain cell groups leaving others unbalanced. Whether the pacemaker is
<br>
a good treatment for all the above remains to be seen; while I think it
<br>
might be great against certain kinds of epilepsy (where it could act as
<br>
a kind of defibrillator for the epileptic locus) and helpful when an
<br>
area gets overly inhibited, it is not obvious that it can help for
<br>
example OCD. 
<br>
<p>What would be really interesting to see is treatments against obesity
<br>
this way - if we can start to control the hypothalamus, then things
<br>
could get real fun. The ethical implications of such regulation of deep
<br>
motivational systems are a messy can of worms.
