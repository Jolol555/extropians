<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's just another baby step toward the eventual police state.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like it, though I await a cogent summary of what it is actually
<br>
intended to do, without having to interpret the bill myself. There must be
<br>
someone on the list who has a good grasp of and interest in IP/IT law who
<br>
could really lay it out for us. I, for one, would find this very useful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why does this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whole subject make me think of how they are trying to control &quot;g*ns&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>I have no idea. Look, I know there are strong views about guns on this list,
<br>
but there are theoretical arguments why even a minarchist state should
<br>
enforce a monopoly on the tools of violence and coercion. They are not not
<br>
necessarily *good* arguments - I have no particular position one way or the
<br>
other about gun control, am quite happy that discussions about it are
<br>
relegated to some other list that Mike Lorrey runs, and don't want to have
<br>
an argument about the issue with anyone on any side of it. I simply say that
<br>
most people you'd want as allies - politicians, lawyers and public
<br>
intellectuals - would find the analogy with gun control not very useful. I
<br>
am finding it difficult to think of even one person whom I know off this
<br>
list with whom I could use such an analogy to suggest that the proposed
<br>
legislation is a *bad* thing. You might conclude that I am surrounded by a
<br>
peer group of liberal intellectuals; perhaps so, but those are the people we
<br>
need on side in the struggle to limit the power of the state.
<br>
<p>Are there better analogies we can look at? My own touchstones for laws that
<br>
attack our freedom (despite being passed by modern liberal democracies) are
<br>
the political advertising legislation that was struck down as unconstutional
<br>
over here in the early 90s - which, among other things, would have prevented
<br>
any paid advertisements on political matters by ordinary people and lobby
<br>
groups, leaving the established political parties with a monopoly - and, in
<br>
the US more recently, the Communications Decency Act. Of course, we have all
<br>
these preposterous drug laws, but that analogy is not going to appeal much
<br>
more widely than the analogy with gun control. Just as most people don't
<br>
like guns, most people don't like drugs. Mutatis mutandis for the proposed
<br>
laws against cloning.
<br>
<p>So, please, someone spell out in clear, non-tendentious terms how this
<br>
legislation would work, its precise implications, and some telling analogies
<br>
that would appeal even to people who support gun control. This exercise will
<br>
provide the basis to begin to &quot;sell&quot; opposition to the legislation to the
<br>
legal community and the wider intellectual community.
