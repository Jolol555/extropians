Daniel concluded:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Okay, I'm going to do my best to stay off this thread...:/
</em><br>
<p>Me, too. (1) It would be wrong of me to try to answer you without reading a 
<br>
lot of the material you've cited, which will take some time (I do have other 
<br>
priorities in life). (2) I don't know how I got onto this thread in the 
<br>
first place. (3) It took me a long time writing that post asking questions 
<br>
of Jerry and I don't have even longer to write an even longer post back to 
<br>
you.
<br>
<p>Daniel had said earlier:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Theft is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;taking someone else's property without consent -- usually wittingly so,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;e.g., when someone steals your car, knowing it belongs to someone (not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking it's just out there).  Since inside Lockean or Randian and most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other theories of property rights or even more generally just theories of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;property without necessarily rights, there is no need for a state to define
</em><br>
<em>&gt;property -- something becomes property or the title to it can be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transferred
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without need of a state to define it as such -- then the state is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessary to define theft.
</em><br>
<p>I do have some familiarity with such accounts of property and I find them 
<br>
unconvincing. Moreover, they are difficult to reconcile with the idea of 
<br>
property as understood by property lawyers. Without a detailed analysis of 
<br>
these accounts, however, the fact that you find them convincing and I don't 
<br>
is not conclusive one way or the other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you accept this, then it is possible for the state to steal.  Since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;state does not define theft or property, there's the possibility that state
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actions can conflict with property.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That many would prefer the legal definition -- because it makes life less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complicated, because they equate &quot;legal&quot; and &quot;moral&quot; or &quot;law&quot; with &quot;right&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or &quot;legal recognition&quot; with &quot;ownership,&quot; because they don't have an viable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alternative to it -- is no argument here.  We could go over the extreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt;examples that most people would agree where it's right to break the law, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that would violate netiquette on the Nazis.:)
</em><br>
<p>Quite so! &lt;g&gt;
<br>
<p>Anyway, my questions to Jerry have actually been about exactly this: what 
<br>
does he see as the moral limits of the law. As you'd know, some have 
<br>
theorised that Nazi law was not law at all because it was inconsistent with 
<br>
the &quot;natural law&quot;. I don't go along with that myself - as a legal 
<br>
positivist, I find it highly implausible - but I'd be interested to know 
<br>
whether you do or whether Jerry does. In any event, you've misread me 
<br>
(which, of course may be the fault of the way I expressed myself) if you 
<br>
think I'm arguing that &quot;if it's legal it must be acceptable&quot; and that I go 
<br>
on to develop a *separate* argument. The issue I'm trying to define 
<br>
throughout, as precisely as I can, is simply why it is wrong for the law to 
<br>
be what it is, ie to include tax legislation etc. And this means that I want 
<br>
a more general answer to the question: what kinds of laws are morally 
<br>
acceptable (or morally binding)? In what circumstances is the imposition of 
<br>
an obligation by the state legitimate? I don't think either of you has 
<br>
answered this so far, or if you have I've missed it. I also raised a further 
<br>
question briefly: what is the effect or significance of a law that should 
<br>
have been enacted (or should not have been part of the common law if it 
<br>
comes to that)? How should we respond to such a law? But this *was* 
<br>
separate; it was not central to my line of questioning.
<br>
<p>You have given at least the sketch of some answers to the overall question 
<br>
of how you would criticise tax and defend a libertarian position, and I'm 
<br>
grateful for that. I must report that your answers raise even more questions 
<br>
in my mind &lt;g&gt;. For example, FWIW, I find your views about social cohesion 
<br>
counter-intuitive. Some of the reading you've suggested may throw up more 
<br>
answers, and I realise I have raised a lot of issues without giving answers 
<br>
of my own. I'm grateful for the citations because they expand the range of 
<br>
material I'm aware of that a sophisticated philosophical libertarian might 
<br>
rely on.
<br>
<p>At one point in an earlier post I almost called out for you to step in and 
<br>
offer your theory of political obligation, etc, coz I figured you'd have 
<br>
one! &quot;Where is Daniel when you need him?&quot; I almost asked. Well, you've done 
<br>
some of it without even being asked.
<br>
<p>And I've ended up writing an abbreviated version of the post I said I 
<br>
wouldn't write... But at least it's an abbreviated version. I'd better end 
<br>
here. Someone else can play the role of philosophical &quot;commie&quot; for a while, 
<br>
I think.
<br>
<p>Cheers
<br>
<p>Russell
