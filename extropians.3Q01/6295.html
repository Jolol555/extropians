<p>Well, that is a big if.  If you go on that line, he might as well grab
<br>
an empty plane.  I was suggesting a situation in which the only time the
<br>
door would be openable is when no passengers could be around.  Security
<br>
would make sure no one was in there (it is a very small room) ahead of
<br>
the pilot.  I suggest the ground control would get the GO code from the
<br>
pilot after she is locked in and before the passengers are allowed on.
<br>
You can &quot;what if&quot; this another 3 sigma down the probability
<br>
distribution, but what is the point?
<br>
<p>If there are enough passengers, they can make the plane unflyable by
<br>
packing themselves in the tail section.  After this week, they could
<br>
probably use cell phones to call for an air strike against themselves.
<br>
The whole point is that cabin security is the quickest way to cover most
<br>
cases, so that is what I expect you will see first.
