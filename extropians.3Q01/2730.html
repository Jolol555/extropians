<em>&gt; &gt;This is another one of the ignorant 'free lunch' claims that can't pan

<em>&gt; Tch tch tch. Mike, this is a pretty strong (not to mention insulting) claim

</em><br>
<p>Actually, Hawking's theoretical work predicted just the sort of
<br>
phenomena you would see to observe a black hole, and several have been
<br>
observed, including at least one galaxy core black hole.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We are

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But, I wasn't actually saying that matter *is* crushed out of existence
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, you can should yourself all over the place, but that doesn't mean
<br>
you're actually saying anything. We are allegedly arguing over whether
<br>
our universe is steady state or big bang. I say the lack of infinite
<br>
size black holes indicates we don't live in an infinite universe....
