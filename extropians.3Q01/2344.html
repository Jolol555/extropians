<em>&gt; Since the segregation problem was solved as a result of private lawsuits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (i.e. Brown v. Board of Education, etc.) we libertarians have no problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with how it turned out. The federal government was acting as a monopoly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'rights insurance' adjustor at the 'reinsurance' level (rather than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retail) where the retail insurance provider had abrogated its contracts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a given sector of society.
</em><br>
<p>Actually I don't think that's actually so. AFAIK Black people in the South
<br>
couldn't get the
<br>
authorities to enforce these private lawsuits unless they took drastic steps
<br>
to put themselves in extreme danger. The lunch counter sit-ins, the freedom
<br>
riders, the bus boycott and business boycotts were undertaken and many young
<br>
black people were injured and killed in attempt to get the state to enforce
<br>
the results of these lawsuits didn't they.? Wasn't the civil rights movement
<br>
an attempt to get the law enforced by the state?
