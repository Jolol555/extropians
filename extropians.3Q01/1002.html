</em><br>
<p>Talk about how silly can the ACLU get (and I respect their
<br>
AVOWED intentions to defend liberty especially for those
<br>
unable to defend themselves.)
<br>
<p>This issue should not be the &quot;use&quot; of such technology but
<br>
the &quot;misuse&quot; of the technology.
<br>
<p>Misuse would (probably) include things like keeping records on
<br>
the movement/location of law abiding (read:  no wants/no warrants)
<br>
citizens.
<br>
<p>Valid use would include picking up those with valid FELONY WARRANTS.
<br>
<p>Give me a break, IF (a big if) there were no misuse, what possible
<br>
complaint would the honest citizen have to locating and arresting
<br>
those with  felony warrants and escaped convicts?
<br>
<p>Efforts should be aimed at regulations and policies to avoid, discourage,
<br>
and eliminate misuse.
<br>
<p>Of course anyone can point out that &quot;there is no way to prevent
<br>
misuse&quot;.  Of course this is true -- but we cannot prevent police
<br>
abuse and misconduct either.  This does not stop us from building
<br>
in safeguards and review procedures, nor does it stop us from
<br>
having police forces.

<em>&gt; Subject: ACLU and Republican leader join forces on privacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a case of bedfellows about as strange as they come, the ACLU has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; joined with House Majority Leader Dick Armey, Republican from Texas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to call for a halt to the use of facial recognition technology as a part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of government surveillance of American citizens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/news/2001/n071101a.html">http://www.aclu.org/news/2001/n071101a.html</a> reads:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Over the past several days, a troubling expansion in the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      technology is being used in the surveillance of ordinary Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      has come to light. In response, we are today joining together to call
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      on all state and local governments to stop using these dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      technologies now before privacy in America is so diminished that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      it becomes nothing more than a fond memory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Majority Leader Armey will ask the General Accounting Office
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      to study the extent to which the federal government is funding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      facial-recognition technologies. In addition, he will ask the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      relevant House Committees to hold hearings on law enforcement use
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      of surveillance technology. The ACLU supports these requests.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I doubt that Armey and the ACLU agree on much.  It's amazing how these new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues are cutting across traditional political divisions.  Even with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the stem cell issue, Catholics are giving cover to Republicans for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support of research in this area, while the Protestant Right continues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to adopt an absolutist stance against it.  I wonder what new divisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and realigments we will see as technology moves on.
