<p><p><em>&gt; One thing I have not seen mentioned by anyone is insurance.  All of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insurance policies I have seen specifically exclude war and acts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism.  As far as I know, none of the damage is covered by insurance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; none of the equipment or losses will be reimbursed, and none of the life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insurance policies will be honored.  Does anybody have more specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information about the insurance industry's response to this?
</em><br>
<p>Well, this also happens to be something I know a little about (along with
<br>
radio-controlled aircraft).  As old timers here know, I spent a decade
<br>
working almost exclusively for Lloyds and other London market insurers,
<br>
analyzing and litigating coverage questions of all kinds up through and
<br>
including stratospheric reinsurance.
<br>
<p>First most life insurance policies do NOT have any kind of exclusion for
<br>
death caused by war/terrorism.  Dealing with life insurance first, the
<br>
threat to that industry is minimal.  It is by far the most conservative and
<br>
heavily and broadly reinsured of all sectors of the insurance market and, as
<br>
a result, the losses there will have minimal impact on the direct insurers
<br>
involved and the risk-spreading function of reinsurance will be most
<br>
effective in buffering the shock.
<br>
<p>Second, losses caused by acts of war and/or terrorism ARE often (probably
<br>
usually) excluded from most first-party property insurance.  However, such
<br>
losses ARE covered separately in &quot;war risk&quot; policies.  Whether specific
<br>
interests had their war risk insured was, of course, a matter for the risk
<br>
managers of each of the businesses involved.  However, I would be greatly
<br>
surprised if the major economic interests involved directly in the WTC
<br>
attack don't have substantial war risk cover, given the prior attack on the
<br>
facility.  This is considered a &quot;specialist&quot; risk (engendering close ties
<br>
between a few odd fellows in The Room and the chaps at Janes) and I really
<br>
wouldn't have wanted to be one of those people last week.  Most of that loss
<br>
will ultimately end up in the hands of a small number of reinsurers like
<br>
Swiss Re and Munich Re.  Whether the direct insurers in The Room topple
<br>
before the impact hits the gnomes (as the reinsurers are often called) will
<br>
depend on the specific terms of the reinsurance contracts.
<br>
<p>Finally, some of the largest losses -- those caused to the airline industry
<br>
due to the immediate grounding of their planes last week and the long-term
<br>
impact of increased costs and decreased revenue -- will almost certainly NOT
<br>
be covered.  The grounding will be considered &quot;force majeur&quot; and will be
<br>
excluded from their BI (business interruption) cover.
