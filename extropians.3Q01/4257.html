</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty convinced by it.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, what I've said for a while
<br>
(<a href="http://discuss.foresight.org/~hibbert/Books.html">http://discuss.foresight.org/~hibbert/Books.html</a>) is &quot;I didn't want to
<br>
read this book, because I expected Herrnstein &amp; Murray to convince me
<br>
that IQ was innate and at least somewhat related to race. I was right.&quot; 
<br>
<em>&gt;From the reviews I had read, I wasn't expecting to disbelieve them, I
</em><br>
was expecting to reach a distasteful conclusion.  
<br>
<p>Fortunately, though they convinced me that there's enough evidence on
<br>
innateness and correlation with race to accept them as facts, they also
<br>
said that there's enough overlap in the ranges of different races that
<br>
it makes no sense for anyone to treat individuals any differently than
<br>
if they weren't facts.
<br>
<p>The more important content of the book, as Lee pointed out, are a
<br>
detailed look at what it is that IQ tests measure (&quot;g&quot;), why that's a
<br>
useful thing to look at, and what the consequences are for society of
<br>
business' increased sensitivity to intelligence.  (My emphasis here
<br>
differs from Lee's.  He said &quot;the effects on society this last century
<br>
due to the widespread use of IQ tests.&quot;)  
<br>
<p>My interpretation of the most important message of the book is something
<br>
like this:
<br>
<p>Business has become more sensitive to differences in intelligence
<br>
between employees.  (Smarter employees make a bigger difference than
<br>
they used to.)  So businesses spend more effort finding, identifying,
<br>
and rewarding smarter employees.  So more smart people (of all races!)
<br>
are attracted to places where their efforts make more of a difference. 
<br>
This leaves many places where intelligence isn't as crucial all the time
<br>
without the wise older people who used to make everything work better. 
<br>
Not all construction workers or cooks need to be really clever, but it's
<br>
useful if there are a few around.  Since bright people can get better
<br>
rewards elsewhere, there aren't as many around in the lowest paying jobs.
<br>
<p>Chris
