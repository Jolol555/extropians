I have found a web site for the team doing the longevity research, the
<br>
New England Centenarian Study, <a href="http://www.med.harvard.edu/programs/necs/">http://www.med.harvard.edu/programs/necs/</a>.
<br>
<p>The paper will be published at <a href="http://www.pnas.org">http://www.pnas.org</a> but this only has last
<br>
month's issue so far.  The site above says they will have a PDF file up
<br>
&quot;shortly&quot;.
<br>
<p>Interestingly, Louis Kunkel, one of the main co-authors, is actually
<br>
a pediatric researcher.  He was studying genetic markers for pediatric
<br>
diseases and I suppose the same techniques apply to the disease of aging.
<br>
<p>The NECS page has some interesting information.  There is a book,
<br>
Living to 100, based apparently on their research with centenarians.
<br>
It tells you how to &quot;make the most of your life&quot;.  They also have a
<br>
longevity calculator, <a href="http://www.livingto100.com/">http://www.livingto100.com/</a>.
<br>
<p>A quote from their page:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it quickly became apparent to us that living to 100 was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a tremendous advantage, we set out to understand how and why the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;centenarians are able to live to such old age, the vast majority of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is spent in excellent health.
<br>
<p>I thought it was funny that it &quot;quickly became apparent&quot; that living
<br>
to 100 was a &quot;tremendous advantage&quot;.  You'd think it would go without
<br>
saying.  At least they didn't feel it was necessary to explain the daring
<br>
philosophy which says that living is better than dying.
<br>
<p>Some points about centenarians from their page:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant obesity is rare.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking history is extremely rare.
<br>
<p>Not too surprising, although Doug Skrecky used to forward a lot of studies
<br>
suggesting that obesity per se was not inherently negative for longevity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A preliminary study suggests that they score low in a domain of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;personality testing called &quot;neuroticism&quot; that translates into not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwelling on things and therefore the ability to manage stress well.
<br>
<p>Being able to handle stress apparently makes a big difference.  One might
<br>
speculate that it not only directly affects health, but that maintaining
<br>
the &quot;will to live&quot; in someone who has lived 100 years would require the
<br>
ability to handle enormous change.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with our hypothesis that centenarians have a history of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aging very slowly and either markedly delaying or even escaping
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age-associated diseases (e.g. heart attack, stroke, cancer, diabetes,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alzheimer's disease), we noted that 90% of them were functionally
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;independent the vast majority of their lives up until the average age
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of 92 years and 75% were the same at an average age of 95 years.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than the incorrect perception that &quot;the older you get the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sicker you get&quot;, centenarians teach us that the older you get the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;healthier you've been.
<br>
<p>That's amazing, 90% still living independently at age 92!  My mom is 80
<br>
and still doing OK by herself but she's not what she was 10 or even 5
<br>
years ago.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many centenarian women have a history of bearing children after the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age of 35 years and even 40 years. From our studies, a woman who
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;naturally has a child after the age of 40 has a 4 times greater chance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of living to 100 compared to women who do not. It is probably not the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;act of bearing a child in one's forties that promotes long life, but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rather, doing so may be an indicator that the woman's reproductive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system is aging slowly and that the rest of her is as well. Such slow
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aging and the avoidance or delay of diseases that adversely impact
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reproduction would bode well for the woman's subsequent ability to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;achieve very old age.
<br>
<p>This is consistent with the fruit fly studies which extended lifespan
<br>
specifically by allowing flies to reproduce only when they were older
<br>
than normal.  Slowing aging over the entire lifespan seems to be a key
<br>
part of living to 100.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least 50% have first-degree relatives and/or grandparents that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also achieve very old age and many have exceptionally old siblings.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Male siblings of centenarians have an 11 times greater chance than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other men born around the same time of reaching age 97 years and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;female siblings have an 8½ greater chance than other females also
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;born around the same time of achieving age 100.
<br>
<p>Those are amazing figures.  Clearly the genetic component for super
<br>
longevity is very strong.  Qualitatively this would seem to suggest a
<br>
relatively small number of genes are involved, otherwise siblings would
<br>
probably not have such a high degree of correlation, right?
<br>
<p>Definitely this is promising research.  True, it may not lead literally
<br>
to a &quot;pill for long life&quot;.  But if they can identify specific genes
<br>
involved it will undoubtedly point to some therapies (which may be ones
<br>
we are already using, but will provide information about which ones are
<br>
most likely to work).
<br>
<p>The other lesson seems to be that it helps to start young.  If we think of
<br>
aging as kind of a snowball effect (growing over time) then interventions
<br>
to slow the rate of aging at a young age should have the largest payoff
<br>
over the totality of the lifetime.
