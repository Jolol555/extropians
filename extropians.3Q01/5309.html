<em>&gt; A logic-based model works differently from a reality-based essentialism

<p>Perhaps where you are it either rains everywhere or doesn't, but in the
<br>
rest of the world, it only rains in specific locations at specific
<br>
times. Several times I've been on one side of the street in the sun
<br>
while those on the other side of the street were being rained on.... so,
<br>
the fact is, you are, essentially, wrong.

<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Realists don't worry about conflict resolution very much. Right is right
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; right, right? The point is debate, dialectic, and conflict are essential
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Especially when realism dictates that water never flows uphill on its
<br>
own, and you insist on living on top of a mountain. Subjectivists always
<br>
think that the universe should conform itself for their own comfort.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; The scientific community has a lot of conflict resolution. There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many, many challenges to theories, ideas, and experiments. They are
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever he wants. But what if a person did have a marvelous new idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and was unable to express it properly, or overcome political pressure?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where is the truth then?
</em><br>
<p>Then it's not truth, is it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your failure to acknowledge the role authority plays in knowledge is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>And your failure to acknowledge the role that the actual universe plays
<br>
in determining reality is very small minded in my opinion.
