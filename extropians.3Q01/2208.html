<p>I did not think you were a statist, though I did think you were a legal
<br>
positivist -- in my use of the term.  (Perhaps my usage is a
<br>
misinterpretation.  I'll have to sleep on that.:)

<p>Well, I have to admit, I've nto read all the posts on this thread -- not the
<br>
&quot;Property and the Law&quot; one but it's mother thread.  It became too
<br>
unmanageable to do so.
<br>
<p>My point on political philosophy was not to belittle you (or anyone), but
<br>
just to show that the answers you want might require a wider net than the
<br>
one you are casting.  If you merely want people's opinions, well, you've got
<br>
plenty of these here.:)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
