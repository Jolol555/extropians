</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly.
</em><br>
<p>I concur. However, there are different types of racists as well. Those
<br>
who think that someone needs to meet a lower standard just because of
<br>
their skin color to get the same job or to be accepted into college, or
<br>
someone who thinks that someone who is 7 generations separated from
<br>
their enslaved ancestors deserves 'reparations', is themselves a racist:
<br>
they are assuming that the black person is inferior to the white person
<br>
in that they are incapable of attaining the same level of achievement
<br>
with the same standards of performance, or that their life was somehow
<br>
oppressed because their great-great-great-great grandparent happened to
<br>
be a slave (rather than, say, a serf).
<br>
<p>These sentiments about affirmative action and reparations arise in the
<br>
liberal white person from the same opinions (no matter how guiltily
<br>
felt) about the inferiority of black people that results from
<br>
stereotypes and ignorance, feelings that blacks are somehow less capable
<br>
of achievement as individuals than whites. Just as the KKK racist
<br>
discriminates by hate and exclusion, the liberal racist discriminates by
<br>
guilt and coddling, and both do it on a basis of skin color rather than
<br>
the character of the individual.
