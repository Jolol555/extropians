<p>&lt;&lt; I should point out that the cosomology has moved on from this one -- poor
<br>
&nbsp;Tipler outlined a great and moving final resurrection analogy (pretty
<br>
&nbsp;similar to Greg Bear's storyline in Eternity, funnily enough, small
<br>
&nbsp;universe), but the cosmological underpinnings of his model were pulled out
<br>
&nbsp;from under his feet within twelve months of publication.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Insofar as we can say anything about the future behavior of the universe,
<br>
&nbsp;the big crunch seems to be an increasingly outside bet. Long, cold, dark and
<br>
&nbsp;isotropic is the current forerunner...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;...not that we don't get to experience a subjective eternity in either case.
<br>
&nbsp;It's a funny old world.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Reason &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>As you did note-its merely the current forerunner, on the other hand, other 
<br>
astronomers and cosmologists have come to see an accelerated expansion as a 
<br>
fairly recent thing. There is also counter theories, based on the same 
<br>
observations that suggest frequent expansions and partial collapses. 
<br>
Physicist Larry Krauss at Case Western University has suggested that we'll 
<br>
never know the fate of the universe. Baring that, I tend to agree with 
<br>
Kurzweil, that the fate of the universe will be decided, not by the weak 
<br>
nuclear force, the strong force, electromagnetism, or even gravity, but by 
<br>
intelligence; in which the other four forces crumble in the face of.
