A scientist's or inventor's lot is a difficult one- when the time has come for a new idea, it permeates the very air, waiting to be
<br>
plucked from nowhere by any chance passerby. The study and interpretation of our Beloved Maximum Leader Greenspan's actions is such
<br>
a conundrum.
<br>
Mr. Daan Joubert has preempted and intersected, albeit differently, some parts of my pet theory:
<br>
<p><a href="http://m1.mny.co.za/MGGold.nsf/Current/4225685F0043D1B285256AA8005F3C14?OpenDocument">http://m1.mny.co.za/MGGold.nsf/Current/4225685F0043D1B285256AA8005F3C14?OpenDocument</a>
<br>
&quot;I dream. Of course, most people do, but my dreams are kind of special. They enact history. Or repeat it, if you wish; but to me,
<br>
while I dream, I am living history..&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;What follows is written in the first person, but the reader should clearly understand these are the words of a dreamer, and nothing
<br>
more. It is also not the full dream, but only parts that are pertinent to the main thread of this theme to be expounded. The dream,
<br>
which has consumed a number of nights, as is usual for these special dreams, is still so vivid and so overpowering and I have so
<br>
much become the character of the dream, that I have over the past few days developed a certain way of expressing myself - one in
<br>
which my sentences are even more convoluted and complex and remote than normal and I hereby undertake to make a special effort to
<br>
keep my prose simple and to the point, taking care to avoid, or where necessary excise the frequent circumlocutions and oblique
<br>
allusions that - quite purposefully on occasion - distract listeners from what I am really saying. ...&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The expression on the face of Senator Sarbanes when I affirmed that even the Department of Defense should be subject to a sunset
<br>
clause was a quiet joy to behold. That was when he asked me whether I would advocate a return to the gold standard. He must have
<br>
read my earlier writings and wanted to test me to see whether I had reneged on the principles I had once believed in so strongly and
<br>
had expressed openly and lucidly. My reply must have come as another surprise, when I said, &quot;I've been advocating that for years, so
<br>
there is nothing new about that . . . . It would probably mean there would only be one vote in the FOMC in favour of that, but it
<br>
would be mine.&quot;
<br>
<p>[note: Mr. Greenspan packed the FOMC long ago with second-rate yes men...]
<br>
<p>I was pleased that the senator had asked that question. It brought my opinion on the gold standard out into the bright lights of
<br>
centre stage.. However, as so often happens, people get intrigued by my somewhat more convoluted statements, and they expend much
<br>
time and effort and consultancy fees to find the correct interpretation of what I had said. Yet, when I really want to convey
<br>
something important in common easily understood words, of rarely more than four syllables, and with sentence construction so simple
<br>
a teenager could understand my message without a problem, these clever people do not hear what I have told them.
<br>
<p>My reply to the senator was and remains the crux of my career; my calling. My destiny...&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;A strategy
<br>
&quot;It required much soul searching before I had finally decided on a course of action. My strategy hinges on my ability to engineer,
<br>
in relatively short order, an economic collapse to rival, nay, exceed, that of the Thirties - the difficult Thirties of my childhood
<br>
years. To do so, I have to duplicate the monetary excesses of the mid-1920's, that led into the Crash of '29, but have to do so
<br>
without introducing the inflationary problems that resulted from similar actions by Burns in the late 60's to early 70's, else the
<br>
FOMC will be compelled to act, prematurely so, in terms of my strategy, and before the crisis can reach the deep proportions that
<br>
would achieve my objective.
<br>
<p>&quot;I had to carefully weigh up the disruption of the global economy that would follow any success I might have, worse than the
<br>
Thirties, against the terrible and extended fiasco that would inevitably arise if governments continued to employ their short
<br>
sighted policies in the absence of a gold standard, this time on a global scale, and a global time frame. Much sooner treat the
<br>
situation as would a surgeon who has to open up somebody's chest to do a heart transplant. Rather the short term agony and long
<br>
recovery of a major and critical operation, followed by newly regained and long to be enjoyed good health, provided, of course, the
<br>
necessary lifestyle discipline is then practiced, than the otherwise unavoidable lingering and debilitating and painwracked decline
<br>
into death.
<br>
<p>&quot;Rather a very sharp, relatively early, induced collapse in the financial markets before the economy of the whole world is so ruined
<br>
that it will take many decades of great hardship for all, but most of all for the common people, to recover. I know of this....&quot;
<br>
<p>=============
<br>
<p>Although the above is a billion light-years beyond what passes for 'mainstream consensus', it is still only conjecture, the stuff of
<br>
future dreams.
