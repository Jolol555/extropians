<p>Or, to paraphrase: &quot;Globalization&quot; is not about free trade, it's about
<br>
creating a safe environment for a planetary oligarchy. Global free
<br>
trade might be a good thing, but not in the absence of unlimited free
<br>
movement of labour -- and I mean movement _by_ the labour, not movement
<br>
of factories to wherever the [trapped] local labour is cheapest.
<br>
<p>This is giving me the cold shudders. Normally I can shrug off political
<br>
nonsense, even oppressive political nonsense -- but even though this 
<br>
law is being proposed in another country, it's hit me a hell of a lot 
<br>
harder than the handgun ban in my own country.
