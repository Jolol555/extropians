<em>&gt;&gt; That's entirely true, it *may* contain such defects for the reason

<em>&gt;&gt; that you give.  But it is also always *possible*, I'm sure that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; will agree, that it contains inaccuracies, omissions, and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; defects that you are simply unaware of.   :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, they mean the same thing don't they?  If I actually publish the paper, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must ensure that some people had discussed it and perhaps even peer-reviewed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  I would find it foolhardy to do otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>They don't mean the same thing; I was referring to the inevitability
<br>
of inaccuracies, omissions, and other defects that will escape the
<br>
notice of all the people who help out.  I'm glad that you believe in
<br>
trying to do your best, however, by obtaining peer-review and discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I define conflict here as:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) An irreconcilable difference in thinking that remains irreconcilable for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    various reasons, including:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    a) lack of a consistent system of thinking (i.e. logic)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    b) lack of decisive knowledge (i.e. ignorance)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    c) lack of a common reference point (i.e. misunderstandings)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see conflicts as harmful or useful, because when they occur, it means 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something had gone wrong with our thought processes or knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>In my opinion, this is not the customary view among experienced intellectuals
<br>
at least where I have grown up.  Rather, intellectual conflict is seen
<br>
(especially by the perspicacious) as differences in values.  Thomas Sowell
<br>
described this brilliantly in the book &quot;Conflict of Visions&quot;.  In it he
<br>
strives to avoid the usual (dumb) explanations that most people believe,
<br>
that their political adversaries are either evil, stupid, or ignorant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the case of two opposing conflicts, it means at least one of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has no validity, or both [have] validity.
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily; within their own value systems, each may have
<br>
validity.  Allow me to provide an example.  Suppose that it is
<br>
being debated whether a number of animals should be bred and
<br>
treated rather cruelly in order to obtain information as to 
<br>
the effectiveness of certain drugs.  (This is not a hypothetical
<br>
example, as you probably know.)  Well, some people place more
<br>
value on the suffering of animals than other people do, and
<br>
moreover, it's not black and white:  there is a whole spectrum
<br>
of belief about how the miseries of animals should be weighed
<br>
against the miseries of human beings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This means we should rectify our thought processes and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information storage so that we cease disagreement.
</em><br>
<p>It's possible that this would be advisable or possible in
<br>
the future, after a significant transformation (e.g., the
<br>
singularity).  But I doubt that such a description or an
<br>
attempt in the language that you have used would be wise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suppose what you mean by &quot;harmful&quot; conflicts the consequence of not ignoring, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; converting or resolving by logic the opposition. Then, we may find results 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ranging from angry sneering to atomic warfare. Unlike some people who claim 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that everyone &quot;is right in his own way&quot;, I think that we can (objectively) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree on a certain set of rules and logic. If not, then discussions have no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purpose as they can achieve nothing.
</em><br>
<p>We can agree on rules of logic.  We can even agree on what constitutes
<br>
evidence and what are strong and weak arguments.  We perhaps cannot agree
<br>
on values.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for &quot;useful&quot; conflicts, I assume you mean the open exchange and discussions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ideas. Such differences I do not classify as conflicts, but as potential 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflicts.
</em><br>
<p>I see.  But is this consistent with the definition that you gave
<br>
above? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whenever a potential conflict materialises into a conflict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would rely [depend] on how people deal with it.  In an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational society, conflicts would arise automatically, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a rational society they would remain as potential conflicts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until the parties resolve them with new knowledge or exchange of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information that reduces misunderstanding.
</em><br>
<p>Well, we are still using the word &quot;conflict&quot; differently, so
<br>
I can't quite agree with that.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  Let me compliment you on your superb mastery of English,
<br>
if it is not your native language.
