<p>
Well, first off, I want to apologize to the people who I may
<br>
have unduly upset by my post.  Some of you may be newer to
<br>
the list and may not realize that one of my fundamental
<br>
motivations revolves around the question of the reduction
<br>
of &quot;Years of Potential Life Lost&quot;.  Previous posts are motivated
<br>
from that perspective.
<br>
<p>Why is this important to discuss? -- because it is precisely
<br>
the issue facing U.S. politicians today.  Whether to execute
<br>
rapid indiscriminante strikes that may satisfy a need for
<br>
revenge or whether to proceed so carefully that individuals
<br>
who have an &quot;irrational&quot; agenda against the United States or
<br>
its citizens are able to execute further actions resulting in
<br>
a not insignificant loss of life (current news reports seem
<br>
to suggest that there are still undiscovered &quot;cells&quot; in the
<br>
U.S.).
<br>
<p>First I will respond to Anders:
<br>
<em>&gt; The ethical is most serious: you assume that human lives can have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative value, and do an essentially utilitarian calculation not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of happiness, but simply of utility towards a certain goal.
</em><br>
<p>Anders, first, can you make a reasonable case that lives that
<br>
have as a fundamental raison d'etre the elimination of other
<br>
lives do not have a &quot;negative value&quot;?  Second, can you make the
<br>
case that individuals who openly support or fund individuals who
<br>
have as their raison d'etre the elimination of other *innocent*
<br>
individuals from the planet is not of &quot;negative value&quot;?
<br>
<p>Bottom line for me -- lives dedicated to the destruction of
<br>
other lives (or supporting the destruction of other lives)
<br>
are clearly unextropic.  So my previous post on face value
<br>
is clearly unextropic.  [NOTE THIS QUITE CAREFULLY -- I
<br>
HAVE PROPOSED A POTENTIALLY SELF-CONTRADICTORAY SOLUTION
<br>
AND AM WELL AWARE OF THAT.]
<br>
<p>Anders continues:
<br>
<em>&gt; The core idea of transhumanism is human development, so that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can extend our potential immensely and become something new. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is based on the assumption that human life in whatever form it may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be (including potential successor beings) is valuable and worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something in itself. It must not be destroyed, because that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroys what transhumanism strives to preserve and enhance.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, of course, and if my previous note is read carefully, it
<br>
should seem apparent that my desire is to maximize &quot;life&quot;.
<br>
Whether the proposed strategy to maximize this is *really*
<br>
optimal is certainly open to significant attack.
<br>
<p>However, the discussion of the fastest path to transhumanism
<br>
or the broadest path to transhumanism is not something that
<br>
should be cast aside due to some unsavory bumps along the road.
<br>
<p>Anders:
<br>
<em>&gt; Even if some humans are not helpful in achieving transhumanity doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean their existence is worthless, and if they are an active
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hindrance to your (or anybody elses) plans destroying their lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is always wrong as long as they do not initiate force against you. 
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but the key perspective is &quot;as long as they do not initiiate
<br>
force against you&quot;.  We are past that point.  They are initiatiating
<br>
force against us in an unextropic perspective that seems to involve
<br>
the support of brain-washed individuals in Afganistan and Pakistan.
<br>
<p>Anders:
<br>
<em>&gt; The logical mistake is to ignore the full consequences of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea, and just look at the &quot;desirable&quot; first-order consequences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What you miss is that if this form of &quot;practical genocide&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used, then the likeliehood of other forms of &quot;practical genocide&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are becoming far higher and harder to ethically suppress, as well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as resistance to the US or other genocidal group is likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become *far* more violent.
</em><br>
<p>Anders, *I* did not, and it would appear the U.S. military
<br>
officials (at least currently) are not, ignoring the potential
<br>
consequences of bombing Islamic states.  My statements were
<br>
carefully made based on estimates that (a) a backlash would
<br>
develop; (b) a response to such a backlash would be moderately
<br>
effective; (c) technologies would develop that would make the
<br>
entire response vs. counter-response irrelevant)
<br>
<p>Statements like &quot;or other genocidal group is likely to become *far*
<br>
more violent&quot; ignores the fact that *we* too can become *far* more
<br>
violent.
<br>
<p>Anders:
<br>
<em>&gt; This post is going to haunt us all - it is in the archives, it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been sent to hundreds of list participants. Be assured that in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few years, when the current uproar has settled down, somebody is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to drag it out and use it against extropianism in the media.
</em><br>
<p>I've heard this from Anders, and I've heard it from Eliezer
<br>
(as well as the not small number of messages filling my personal
<br>
mailbox)
<br>
<p>I must only say that I am shocked and amazed.  If one cannot voice
<br>
on the extropian list thoughts, ideas and opinions that one has
<br>
for the maximization of the evolution of our society -- then we
<br>
are doomed.  We are implicitly stating that ideas exist that are
<br>
not fit for public consumption or that we would prefer the veneer
<br>
of public approval rather than the debate of rigorous, rational
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p>Strike me down, tear me to shreads, rip me into tiny pieces --
<br>
but never, never, never argue that my voice should not be heard.
<br>
<p>It is worth noting that Eliezer has written a very detailed response
<br>
to some of my perspectives.  I do not agree with all of his
<br>
perspectives, but recognize their importance to the discussions
<br>
and would encourage all list readers to peruse them.  I hope
<br>
that I will have the opportunity to respond to them within the
<br>
next few days.
<br>
<p>Respectfully,
<br>
Robert J. Bradbury
