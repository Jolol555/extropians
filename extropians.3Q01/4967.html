From: &quot;Greg Burch&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gregburch@gregburch.net?Subject=Re:%20US%20Science%20Education%20Sucks&In-Reply-To=&lt;02aa01c12dd3$49842170$0a79afce@braniac&gt;">gregburch@gregburch.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Olga, relax.  &quot;Mexican&quot; is the word in English for people from Mexico.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so happens that in LA and Houston and, I guess from Brian's post, Atlanta,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most numerous population of recent immigrants who are just starting up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the socio-economic ladder are from Mexico.
</em><br>
<p>I understand about the word &quot;Mexican&quot; - there's nothing wrong with that word
<br>
per se
<br>
any more than using the word &quot;Portuguese&quot; or &quot;Thai&quot; or &quot;French,&quot; but I was
<br>
reacting to the WAY it was used ... and not so much in Brian Atkin's case
<br>
(where
<br>
I had some questions, to which Brian kindly replied just before he plonked
<br>
me).  If you will recall, in tandem I pasted in something from Natasha's
<br>
recent post:  &quot;At first, only those with money or connections had them.
<br>
Today, in downtown Los Angeles, there are more Mexicans using cell phones
<br>
than executives.&quot;
<br>
<p>What was the implication in that sentence?  That once upon a time when cell
<br>
phones were expensive they had a certain cachet as only rich hoity-toity
<br>
CEOs could get their hands on them; but now these formerly exclusive handy
<br>
little gadgets have become so cheap and plentiful that &quot;Mexicans&quot; have them
<br>
(Mexicans in this case standing for a catch-all word meaning what? -- poor
<br>
people? riff-raff? the hoi-polloi? illegal aliens?).
<br>
<p>I was wondering how that would read if the sentence were altered slightly,
<br>
i.e.:  &quot;At first, only those with money or connections had them.  Today, in
<br>
downtown Los Angeles, there are more Asians using cell phones than
<br>
executives&quot;; or &quot;... there are more blacks using cell phones than
<br>
executives&quot;; or &quot;there are more Jews using cell phones than executives.&quot;
<br>
If you were Asian, black or Jewish - how would you react to a sentence like
<br>
that?  Again, what is the implication here (using what I wrote in this
<br>
paragraph as an example):  That there are no Jewish executives?  That Asians
<br>
couldn't afford cell phones until cell phones came down in price (implying
<br>
there are no rich Asians)?  That there are no professional black people?
<br>
<p>I had the same question when I read the sentence about &quot;Mexicans&quot; in
<br>
Natasha's post.  I lived in San Diego for 8 years, and got to know a number
<br>
of Mexican-Americans who were lawyers, teachers, executives, and physicians.
<br>
Even though this was 20 years ago (when I lived in San Diego) I could just
<br>
imagine their reaction if they'd read Natasha's sentence about &quot;Mexicans&quot;:
<br>
&quot;How ignorant.&quot;
<br>
<p>Maybe Natasha meant &quot;poor people.&quot;  Maybe she meant &quot;illegal aliens&quot; or
<br>
&quot;immigrants.&quot;  I'm not sure what Natasha meant, but I don't think she really
<br>
meant to say &quot;Mexicans.&quot;  Not all Mexicans are poor, for one thing, and
<br>
there ARE Mexican executives.  So it seems prudent  not to characterize
<br>
&quot;Mexicans&quot; in an offset example to &quot;executives,&quot; any more than
<br>
characterizing Jews, blacks, or Asians in the same way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually where I live, housing construction continues to boom to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; point where if we didn't have all those Mexicans moving here we'd be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; in a real shortage of labor.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Brian's point about having lots of inexpensive labor supplied by a huge
</em><br>
pool &gt; of immigrants from El Sud in the US raises an important point: Unlike
<br>
Japan, &gt; we don't have the same incentives to roboticize a lot of
<br>
entry-level jobs.
<br>
<p>Greg, this is a good point.  The only icky feeling I got from Brian Atkin's
<br>
post is in the wording he used regarding &quot;all those Mexicans.&quot;  These are
<br>
people - not just some amorphous source of &quot;cheap labor.&quot;  It seems to me
<br>
that if anyone can be kind, appreciative and compassionate about a group of
<br>
laborers, it is people with seemingly every privilege in the world going for
<br>
them - leisure time, money, brains and power.
<br>
<p>What you said about roboticizing entry-level jobs makes sense to me.  But
<br>
while we are still using people to do our dangerous, exhausting, low-paying,
<br>
&quot;low status&quot; types of jobs, can we show some compassion and humanity?  Can
<br>
we treat people who are willing to do our hard labor with respect as our
<br>
fellow human beings, and not refer to them dismissively as &quot;all those [fill
<br>
in appropriate nationality blank].&quot;
<br>
<p>I don't know if Extroprians or the Singularity Institute has a SIG which
<br>
addresses social concerns and damage control in the here and now (before the
<br>
Singularity).  If not, I would suggest starting one.  Brian Atkins has
<br>
already made it known that he doesn't &quot;have time for PC crap. Why not take
<br>
it somewhere else and waste their time with it?&quot;  (I understand, he is a
<br>
busy guy.)
<br>
<p>Let me end by saying - and I don't mean to be churlish, but -- I believe
<br>
&quot;somewhere else&quot; is already here.
<br>
<p>Olga
