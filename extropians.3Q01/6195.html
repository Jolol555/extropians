<p>
It seems that the systems needed to avert another similar terrorist
<br>
act would be rather complex and/or intrusive. The worst thing is
<br>
that even if we implement a defense against hijacked airplanes as
<br>
projectiles, the next attack might be a tanker ship with ammonia
<br>
blowing up in a harbour, or some other dirty trick. No need for cool
<br>
weapons of mass destruction when fertilizer can do. 
<br>
<p>What really could have worked better yesterday is information. As
<br>
soon as I heard about that something had happened, I tried to check
<br>
net-based newssources and found them all blocked. If the hijacking
<br>
and the likely targets had been detected a bit earlier, many lives
<br>
could likely have been saved. The same is true after the crashes: if
<br>
survivors and rescue workers would have been able to get accurate
<br>
information about each other's whereabouts, the state of the
<br>
building and available resources more people could have been saved.
<br>
It is all a problem of information management.
<br>
<p>This is actually something where some transhumanist technologies
<br>
could be very useful. Having implanted location transponders might
<br>
be an extreme step, but just having a distributed wireless networ
<br>
where each computer acts as a local base station would help. Imagine
<br>
a super-redundant network, which would likely be better able to
<br>
handle the onslaught of callers, web visitors and queries. By adding
<br>
some GPS capability, it would help people navigate in unlighted or
<br>
smokefilled buildings, as well as give rescue workers the chance to
<br>
find them. Ubiquitious information processing makes it harder to
<br>
keep a hijacking secret or hide where it is. Pattern recognition
<br>
software might even be able to detect an imminent disaster and sound
<br>
the alarm. 
<br>
<p>This doesn't solve the basic terrorism problem, but helps create a
<br>
society more resilient to disasters. Assuming of course that we can
<br>
keep the software running without causing its own disasters...
