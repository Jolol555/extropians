<em>&gt; Lee Corbin, Emlyn, Robert Bradbury and others have been talking in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively calm tone about &quot;eugenics&quot; recently.  I just want to point out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that while it may be possible for some people to use this term calmly, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an extremely loaded term when used in public.  It's loaded enough that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would really be a good idea to find a better word.
</em><br>
<p>Only among people who have no sense of humor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While there are people who object to the idea of selective breeding of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people (which is the same idea as, but a completely different slant than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some people deciding not to have children with certain genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characteristics), the real strike against the term is that the Nazis used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to mean the selective killing of people the government didn't like.   At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this point, there's no way to disassociate the term from that meaning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't imagine why anyone would want to use the term today if they hoped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to convince others to listen to them calmly.  A few people will be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; listen calmly, but others will start looking for tar and feathers.  Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would you want to start a conversation around this word?
</em><br>
<p>Desensitization? While eugenics specifically is about state control of
<br>
breeding, what we espouse is entirely the opposite: individual control
<br>
over breeding (of natural or artificial nature). An argument can be made
<br>
that state policies which forbid private citizens from breeding as they
<br>
wish are just as much classifiable as eugenics as state policies which
<br>
mandate that private citizens breed as the state wishes....
<br>
<p>Isn't it odd that OUR ideas are classified as 'eugenics' by the state
<br>
and the luddites, when it is their policies that are eugenics in fact?
