<p>
Interesting. Yesterday I attended a seminar held by Jagdish N. Bhagwati 
<br>
(<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jb38/">http://www.columbia.edu/~jb38/</a>) where he made some points which might
<br>
be relevant to this post. 
<br>
<p>Bhagwati is very much free trade and makes good case that it is actually
<br>
better in the long run for everybody. But that doesn't mean you can
<br>
introduce it immediately everywhere. Bhagwati actually suggests that
<br>
lowering tariffs in some countries should be done at a slow rate to give
<br>
local industry a chance to build up - but this is a very tricky
<br>
operation, since due to public choice effects local groups soon find it
<br>
very tempting to retain the tariffs (which will benefit them, but not
<br>
the public).  As for the IMF, Bhagwati has apparently been advising them
<br>
(he seems to be the advisor to just about everybody) for this policy.
<br>
<p>The real villains here are of course the farmers that ask for subsidies
<br>
and the politicians who give it to them - that way the farmers get rich
<br>
from the taxpayers, and indirectly keep the thrid world down. In Europe
<br>
it is even worse, our system gives the average farmer roughly a Rolls
<br>
Royce a year in money. 
<br>
<p>Another factor is that there are many more bilateral treaties than
<br>
multilateral treaties; this is because you can fairly easily get a lot
<br>
of industry and lobbyists behind particular treaties but not general
<br>
ones (Kodak would love more free trade with Mexico, but doesn't like to
<br>
give the Japanese competitors a chance at the same market). This goes
<br>
not just for the treaties but also the organisations. Apparently the WTO
<br>
has a serious lack of funding - because several of the richest countries
<br>
(at the Quadrilateral Trade Ministers Meeting) prefer an organisation
<br>
with weighed votes which favors them, rather than the more democratic
<br>
WTO (which is the one being protested against by the activists - ironic,
<br>
ironic). 
<br>
<p>So, I would say that Robert is right: the foxes have been left in charge
<br>
of the hen-house. But it is important to distinguish between the side
<br>
effects of trade liberalisation and the distortions due to opportunistic
<br>
governments, NGOs and corporations. Overall the evidence strongly favors
<br>
free tradel, it is just that implementing it is not just an issue of
<br>
saying &quot;OK, let's trade freely&quot;.
