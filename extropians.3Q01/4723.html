<p><em>&gt; There is definitely a &quot;level of abstraction&quot; between you and the real world. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our senses, as well as they enable are ambling through physical space, only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relate to our minds a poor semblance of what is really going on &quot;out there.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>That's the best way to look at it, I'd guess.

<p><em>&gt; The more complicated issue to me is, what can be reduced to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualifying as the difference, between You and your body? 
</em><br>
<p>I think that this was solved the very first time someone started to
<br>
consider the possibility that your brain is in a vat in Moscow, or
<br>
to think about having a brain transplant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you feedback from a neuromuscular system, plus memory?
</em><br>
<p>It's not possible to say what a person *is*.  That's the dreaded &quot;is&quot; of
<br>
identity that Korzybski and everyone warn against.  Give up on that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about hundreds of other minor sensations and habits that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will need to be duplicated sufficiently, in order to &quot;fool&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the uploaded personality?
</em><br>
<p>Eugene answers that one, (although with too much brevity, almost to the
<br>
point of incomprehensibilitity):
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Make a dumb brute force upload, then you don't need to worry about anything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then you can start tinkering, should you feel an irresistible urge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You don't have to understand anything about the emergent properties. Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model the physical layer with sufficient fidelity, and the emergent stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, well, it emerges spontaneously.
</em><br>
