<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for religious singularities, I think the invention of monotheism was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of them. That was a great invention, since it sharpened the memetics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of religion quite a bit. Before, you had to convince others that your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favorite god was really great and that they had to worship him *too*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now you could instead convince them that there was only *your* god, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all other gods were wrong - a bit harder at first, but once a person is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; converted he is firmly converted and less likely to defect. Add the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socioeconomics of monotheism, and you have a recipe for singularity.
</em><br>
<p>Brilliant insight, Anders!  This is precisely congruent with thoughts I've
<br>
been having the last few days as I read Esposito's &quot;Islam: The Straight
<br>
Path,&quot; acknowledged by many to be a very good primer on the history and
<br>
content of Islamic culture.  One of the distinguishing characteristics of
<br>
Islam is its radical monotheism. This is seen in the prohibition on any kind
<br>
of &quot;associationism&quot;, i.e. the heresy of &quot;associating&quot; *anything* with Allah.
<br>
The prohibition on associationism expresses itself in the shunning of images
<br>
of god or the Prophet, which extreme fundamentalists extend to any kind of
<br>
visual image of *any* person (thus the Taliban's law against any kind of
<br>
photograph or the use of any kind of video device by &quot;the faithful&quot;.)
<br>
<p>One of the basic reasons for Islamic antipathy to Christianity is the
<br>
latter's doctrine of the Trinity, which Muslim's denounce as heretical
<br>
fracturing of the fundamental unity of Allah.  Interestingly, the radical
<br>
monotheism of Islam has given rise to the pantheism that naturally follows
<br>
from a rigorously unitary notion of god -- in Sufism.  Unfortunately, this
<br>
has then also been coupled with the radically totalitarian vision of
<br>
shariah, so that the all-pervasive notion of Sufistic pantheism then doubles
<br>
back on itself to return to the kind of obsessive social universalism we see
<br>
in all facets of Islam.  As my study of Islamic thought and history deepens
<br>
and widens, I keep looking for signs of the kind of moderating influence
<br>
that the 18th century deists had on Christianity, but to no avail.  The
<br>
history of Sufism is a good example of why.
<br>
<p>This last fact of the history of the evolution of Islamic culture is one
<br>
that has driven the despair I am coming to feel about the possibility that
<br>
we can hope to see a milder form of Islam develop any time soon.  The
<br>
problem is the totalitarian conception of shariah (protected by the doctrine
<br>
of &quot;bida&quot; or *the sin of innovation*, much more than the violent roots of
<br>
Islam.
<br>
<p>At any rate, I think that effort to try to develop memetic engineering tools
<br>
for moderating Islam is well spent, even though the task seems to be *much*
<br>
more difficult than a similar enterprise applied to Christianity.  Mohammed
<br>
was one sly fellow, building a much more robust memetic immune system into
<br>
the basic concepts of Islam.  It's a much simpler and more robust over-all
<br>
construct than Christianity.
