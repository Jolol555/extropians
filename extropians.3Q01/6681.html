<p>Harvey et.al, made a good point, well taken.  We are not at war
<br>
with Islam, we are at war with terrorists.  The fake Korans wouldnt
<br>
work for that reason.  Information tech is a double edged sword.
<br>
<p>Speaking of which, that biz that Joe Dees posted about Falwell
<br>
and Robertson, have we any secondary proof that they really
<br>
said those words?  I can see where someone could post disinfo
<br>
that could be innocently picked up and reposted.  Did anyone
<br>
actually hear the broadcast or offer a major news org that
<br>
confirms it?  I am surprised as hell that two players as politically
<br>
savvy as these two clowns would say such a thing.  They would
<br>
hafta know it would blow up in their faces to use this tragedy
<br>
as a chance to ride a political hobby horse.  spike
