Mom went through a magnetometer the other day at the airport. She
<br>
happens to have a big titanium plate and screws in her arm. Did the
<br>
buzzer go off? Nope. Puzzled, she told the security person about the
<br>
plate and asked why the detector didn't detect this large metal object
<br>
in her body. The security person said &quot;Just move along.&quot;
<br>
<p>Its rather obvious that titanium is not a magnetic metal, so it is
<br>
undetectable by a magnetometer. It's also obvious that it is a rather
<br>
useful material to use in the manufacture of weapons: knives, clubs,
<br>
even firearms.... and airport magnetometers cannot detect them.
<br>
<p>Think about this for a minute. This means that the only real means of
<br>
ensuring that passengers are not armed is to strip and cavity search
<br>
every airline passenger.
<br>
<p>Think about the implications: since it is therefore impossible to
<br>
prevent all passengers from being armed unless we choose to live in a
<br>
big brother police state, we MUST have armed people on every flight.
