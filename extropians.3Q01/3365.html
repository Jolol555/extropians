<p><em>&gt; Josh Cahoon has brought up the deep subject of *why* we believe what

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What would we do with if we found out that reason is a minor factor?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reason is* a minor factor!  We obtain our initial beliefs in any given area
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by various processes ... an entire gestalt very quickly calculated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your brain.  ...  Reason will have nothing to do with it.
</em><br>
<p>Of course if evolution had primarily wanted us to hold true beliefs, it might
<br>
have made those unconscious processes mirror reason in many ways,
<br>
including the use of criticism.  So the question is to what extent brains
<br>
evolved to seek truth, vs. other goals for beliefs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The role of reason---for the very few who actually hold internal debates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ----is to expose your new belief to a variety of well formulated logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks based on your other beliefs and upon a huge number of memes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lodged in your mind.  ...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; So, now that we were free to *conjecture* a new belief, guess what?  We
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; immediately seized upon the belief that was most emotionally compelling,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to wit, the one that favored our own candidate in a highly charged election.
</em><br>
<p>Once you realize that you are biased toward your candidate, you can correct
<br>
your beliefs without elaborate use of reason.  Just move your beliefs
<br>
in the direction of beliefs favored by those who like the other candidate.
<br>
If you realize you have this option, and choose not to use it, I think you must
<br>
admit to yourself that you are not really truth-seeking in this area.
