<p>Mike -
<br>
<p>This allegation that illiteracy has increased among African Americans
<br>
following Brown vs Board of Education is, as well as surprising, also
<br>
quite inaccurate. According to Arthur Hu's statistics site
<br>
(<a href="http://www.leconsulting.com/arthurhu/index/literacy.htm">http://www.leconsulting.com/arthurhu/index/literacy.htm</a>), which I hope
<br>
you find a sufficiently conservative source, illiteracy among blacks
<br>
over age 14 declined from 11% to 3.6% from 1947 to 1969. Also check out 
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/publications/majorpub/120yr/porintr1.txt">http://nces.ed.gov/publications/majorpub/120yr/porintr1.txt</a>. I'd be
<br>
interested in seeing the source of your misinformation. I see many
<br>
distortions and outright fabrications circulating in conservative
<br>
circles. I am beginning to suspect that the garden variety conservative
<br>
mentality may be somehow less inclined to skepticism and more toward
<br>
accepting questionable data which supports existing ideas. The
<br>
conservative disinformation machinery on the internet certainly has no
<br>
liberal analog.
<br>
<p>It might help to understand more fully the context of racial
<br>
discrimination in education. It formed part of a system to
<br>
disenfranchise blacks and poor people in general. Another important
<br>
component was literacy tests. If you didn't educate blacks, you also
<br>
denied them political power. This would seem to be highly
<br>
anti-libertarian, the way many libertarians present their philosophy.
<br>
<p>It is interesting that your allegation seems to reveal some hostility
<br>
toward school desegregation. I am surprised that you would attribute
<br>
Brown vs Board of Education to &quot;the left.&quot; Being perhaps something of a
<br>
leftist myself, I will take the compliment, but do conservatives oppose
<br>
that decision? Maybe 40 years ago, but today? I had thought you
<br>
considered yourself a libertarian. Yet, opposition to school
<br>
desegregation would seem to fit a pattern I have noticed among some
<br>
&quot;libertarians&quot; of espousing anti-libertarian positions when they
<br>
conflict with conservative inclinations. In this instance, a libertarian
<br>
would, if true to his or her philosophy, support Brown vs. Board of
<br>
Education because it removed government practices which were restrictive
<br>
on personal freedom, e.g. attending the school of a person's choice. I
<br>
have heard many libertarians complain about civil rights laws when they
<br>
impinged upon the behavior of individuals. But what libertarian
<br>
principle is transgressed by Brown vs Board of Education, which only
<br>
increases personal choice at the expense of government control? One
<br>
things libertarians frequently promise, in defense of the removal of
<br>
civil rights protections in the private sphere, is that a libertarian
<br>
government, such as it might be, would treat all citizens fairly
<br>
regardless of race. Is this not what Brown vs Board of Education was all
<br>
about? Who would oppose such a law? Certainly such opposition could not
<br>
be motivated merely be libertarian philosophy.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
