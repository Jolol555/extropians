OK, try this. We have 20 patients in a hospital with similar ailments. In
<br>
claiming JR's million $ we are going to demonstrate the placebo effect as
<br>
a PK-effect. Patients are randomly assigned to group a or group b. Group a
<br>
gets sugar pills. Group b gets no treatment during the trial period. If
<br>
group a improves by measured criteria we claim the million $. The sugar
<br>
didn't cause the effect. It was SUGGESTION that caused it and not any
<br>
physical treatment. That's PK.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; what others would call a placebo effect to some causal agent without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proving any actual linkage mechanism beyond a synchronicity of events. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case in point is one recently released which purports to show that low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level radiation from nuclear plants causes significant rates of fetal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; congenital defects, by looking at a population local to a nuke plant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during its start up and shut down. They claim this 'low level radiation'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the culprit, despite there being other more significant sources of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radiation, including the sun, radon in their homes, and the radioactive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fly ash in the concrete of the buildings they live and work in. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also fail to consider that the rise in fetal defects could easily be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explained as a stress related phenomenon of media hype inducing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excessive paranoia in pregnant mothers. Another thing they fail to do in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the study is to look for similar rises and falls in fetal congenital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defects in populations around coal plants, since it is a proven fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the average coal plant puts out more radiation in its fly ash than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the entire commercial nuke industry does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this instance, the likely actual culprit according to Occams Razor,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is stress related to media propaganda. Since stress is a known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributor to cancer, it follows that it would also be a contributor to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developmental problems in fetuses.
