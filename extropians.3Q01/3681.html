<p>You are absolutely right.  But the margin is small.  The fact that they
<br>
ALWAYS do it makes it totally consistent and repeatable, which is why they
<br>
are capable of correcting it as you noted above.  Their may be bias in their
<br>
methods, but they do fairly correct the data to present more accurate
<br>
results.
<br>
<p>This is common in statistics.  A lot of sampling methods turn out to be
<br>
biased on way or the other.  One theory for this particular bias is that
<br>
liberals are more likely to talk to liberal media, whereas conservatives are
<br>
less likely to trust or cooperate with the media.
