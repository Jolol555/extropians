<em>&gt;Subject: Fwd: A friend's return flight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Thu, 20 Sep 2001 13:03:24 -0700 (PDT)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now, the threats that are left are things like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plastics, wood, knives, and other weapons that can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;made or things like that which can be used as weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here is our plan and our rules. If someone or several
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people stand up and say they are hijacking this plane,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I want you all to stand up together. Then take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whatever you have available to you and throw it at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them. Throw
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it at their faces and heads so they will have to raise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their hands to protect themselves. The very best
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protection you have against knives are the pillows and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blankets. Whoever is close to these people should then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;try to get a blanket over their heads. Then they won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be able to see. Once that is done, get them down and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;keep them there. Do not let them up. I will then land
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the plane at the closest place and we WILL take care
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of them. After all, there are usually only a few of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them and we are 200+ strong! We will not allow them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take over this plane. I find it interesting that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;US Constitution begins with the words &quot;We, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people&quot;-that's who we are, THE people and we will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be defeated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Execellent, excellent! In keeping with the general level of discussion and 
<br>
the spirit of this mailing list with respect to WTC 911, I hereby offer my 
<br>
suggestions on better ways for passengers to fiol hijackers:
<br>
1. have well-endowed, beautiful woman ride the plane, and have them strip in 
<br>
front of the hijackers, so that when their attention is diverted, the rest 
<br>
of the passengers can bull rush them.
<br>
<p>2. Have poison gas in the vents and tehn the drop down oxygen masks are the 
<br>
only thing that will keep you alive, thereby fioling the hijackers (also no 
<br>
carryon gas masks allowed).
<br>
<p>Do you guys have any more?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;With that, the passengers on the plane all began to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;applaud, people had tears in their eyes, and we began
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the trip toward the runway. The flight attendant then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;began the safety speech. One of the things she said is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that we are all so busy and live our lives at such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fast pace. She asked that everyone turn to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neighbors on either side and introduce themselves,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tell each other something about your families and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;children, show pictures, whatever. She said &quot;for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;today, we consider you family. We will treat you as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such and ask that you do the same with us.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Throughout the flight we learned that for the crew,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this was their first flight since Tuesday's tragedies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It was a day that everyone leaned on each other and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;together everyone was stronger than any one person
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alone. It was quite an experience. You can imagine the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feeling when that plane touched down at Dulles and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heard &quot;welcome to Washington Dulles Airport, where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;local time is 5:40&quot;. Again, the cabin was filled with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;applause. Last night I saw a program with college
</em><br>
<em>&gt;students where one of them said that at their campus
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there are no more hyphenated titles, i.e.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;African-American, etc., everyone is just an American.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No one will ever be able to take that pride away from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us. &quot;
