</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe this will help explain why. Excerpts from PBS Online News Hour

<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/september96/iraq_oil_9-5.html">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/september96/iraq_oil_9-5.html</a>
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I'm not questioning that a reduction in oil availability would
<br>
cause major hardship, I'm questioning whether giving Israel aid
<br>
lessens the risk of such a reduction.
<br>
<p>Beyond the US relationship with Israel, I question whether anything
<br>
the US has done or will do in the Middle East actually lessens the
<br>
risk of reduced access to oil.  To the contrary.
<br>
<p>Like we did in Southeast Asia, we've stupidly taken the colonial
<br>
mantle from the UK and France, manufactured enemies, supported
<br>
tyrants because it was expedient for a moment, and generally helped
<br>
screw up every country we've bothered with.  Instead of taking on
<br>
that colonial mantle/yoke, we should've learned from the mistakes
<br>
of the UK and France and left well enough alone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The US hasn't used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Israel as a base from which to attack countries that refuse to sell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or raise the price of oil.  Is there an implicit threat to do so?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course there is, although it's not usually stated in the terms you've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used. That's what maintaining a military presence is all about. Look at it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a smaller scale. When you hire uniformed security guards to watch your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warehouse at night, your expectation is that his or her mere presence will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deter burglars.
</em><br>
<p>The US doesn't have a military presence in Israel.  Does the US pay Israel
<br>
to guard access to oil?  What has, what could Israel do in the event that
<br>
such acess was threatened?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; With respect to the Gulf War's relevance to preserving Israel -- the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not that Israel is the ONLY possible staging area. As you've probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noted, US is now discussing using Pakistan for access to Afghanistan. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point is that Israel is reliable--that is, it can be depended on *under any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and all circumstances*.
</em><br>
<p>I actually noted that Turkey is another possible staging area.
<br>
Pakistan and Afghanistan are largely irrelevant, neither is anywhere
<br>
near the oil fields.  I hardly think that Israel can be depended on under
<br>
any circumstances to defend our access to oil.  Under even moderately bad
<br>
circumstances, Israel's very survival would be threatened, and it would
<br>
do what it had to do to ensure its survival (as it should), not to ensure
<br>
our access to oil at low prices.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't believe it's ever had to defend itself without US support.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They've mostly managed on their own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See my reply to Alejandro. Israel has always had aid from the US.
</em><br>
<p>I saw.  Nothing mentioned besides financial aid, something currently
<br>
somewhere between $3 and $5.5 billion annually it seems.  According
<br>
to <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/is.html">http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/is.html</a> the
<br>
Israeli government has annual expenditures of $40 billion and the
<br>
country a GDP of $105 billion.  No doubt a loss of ~$5 billion
<br>
would case some temporary economic hardship, but a military threat?
<br>
I think not.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What has the US provided
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; apart from money and intelligence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huh? Don't understand what point you're trying to make.
</em><br>
<p>Money and intelligence aren't very tangible.  My point is that
<br>
Israel doesn't owe its survival to US support.  If the US ended
<br>
foreign aid today, Israel would be just as ready to kick Syria's
<br>
ass tomorrow and next year ad nauseum as it is today.
