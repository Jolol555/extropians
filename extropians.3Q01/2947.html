<p>Aha!  With a name like Bokov, I knew you *had* to be a chess player.
<br>
<p>{8^D
<br>
<p>Speaking of chess, there is another round of interesting carbon vs.
<br>
silicon chess coming up in October.  In 1997, Deep Blue the IBM
<br>
multijillion dollar multiprocessor supercomputer scalped then-champion
<br>
Gary Kasparov.  Since then, a new heir-apparent, Vladimir Bokov...
<br>
kidding, Vladimir Kramnik,  has toppled Kasparov and has
<br>
demonstrated himself to be superior in anti-silicon chess as well.
<br>
<p>So Kramnik has been selected to defend the honor of the carbons,
<br>
but theres a new twist.  In the upcoming match, Kramnik will face
<br>
not a supercomputer, but a rather ordinary workstation or pumped up
<br>
PC, reported to be a quad-processor 933 MHz PIII outfit.  He will
<br>
go up against *commercially available* software.  Kramnik will face
<br>
a setup that you or I could buy with the contents of our piggy banks,
<br>
{assuming of course a large piggy bank} should we want {for
<br>
some reason} an opponent whose strength is approximately
<br>
equal to the best humans on the planet.
<br>
<p>In this match, Kramnik will be allowed access to the software for a
<br>
month prior to the match, except for the opening book, which will be
<br>
held in reserve by the creators of the software, called Deep Fritz.  All
<br>
the advantages given to the silicon in the Deep Blue match will now
<br>
be cancelled.  Any guesses on the results?  I have one.  After studying
<br>
Kramnik's style, I predict an even match: all draws.  If this is the case,
<br>
<p>the silicon will have accomplished an awesome, stunning achievement.
<br>
<p>Go silicon!  spike
