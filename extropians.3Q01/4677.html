From: &quot;Emlyn O'regan&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:oregan.emlyn@healthsolve.com.au?Subject=Re:%20Paying%20for%20Schools%20(was:%20SOCIETY:%20Re:%20The%20privatization%20ofpublic%20security)&In-Reply-To=&lt;007c01c12b99$5f0be410$421c79a5@braniac&gt;">oregan.emlyn@healthsolve.com.au</a>&gt;

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think I'm proposing something different to James, which is that I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the public school system should probably be privatised, while government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding remains intact. But what we are both saying is that the decision
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; fund only a single style of school, &quot;public schools&quot;, makes it very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult for alternatives to exist, unless the target market of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternatives are not sensitive to price (or in fact use the price as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; status symbol).
</em><br>
<p>Alternatives do exist in public schools.  In Seattle there are many &quot;magnet&quot;
<br>
public schools - each specializing in a particular &quot;strength&quot; (art and
<br>
drama, science, and the like).  Public schools can certainly be better, and
<br>
I don't have anything against private schools, particularly - I just haven't
<br>
been convinced they're much better than public schools.
<br>
<p>My son, too, started to read at two.  By kindergarten he was reading
<br>
everything he could get his hands on (he went to public school, but he
<br>
basically taught himself in the subjects which interested him).  He was a
<br>
great one with computers, and has had an array of them from the time he was
<br>
very young, and now makes his living in the tech industry.  With the advent
<br>
of self-directed learning (through technology), public schools can fit each
<br>
individual student's talents, make learning more stimulating than ever, and
<br>
maybe blur the line between private and public schools even more (assuming
<br>
there is a discernable line now).  That's where I believe all education is
<br>
heading - to the vast array of options available to stimulate, teach and
<br>
entertain children, as well as adults, throughout their lives.  And in
<br>
technology - this is where public schools could do a great service in
<br>
introducing poor children to technology - children who may not have access
<br>
to computers at home, for instance.  Computers are like the new books
<br>
(although, I'm not suggesting doing away with books - as my
<br>
overrun-with-books-house could attest).
