<p><em>&gt; When Tiberius Gracchus wrote on a parallel thread  &quot;...the churches are

</em><br>
<p>That has not been my experience at all.  I have met very vibrant
<br>
and engaged people in churches as well as outside them.  I have
<br>
met far more open-hearted and deeply motivated to change the
<br>
world people in churches/religions than outside them.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I realized it was his/her personal view, however it

</em><br>
<p>How about &quot;who value ideas other than what some think are the
<br>
limits of exptropian ideas&quot;?  The above makes it sound like
<br>
there is precisely this opposition and fundamental incompatible
<br>
that I don't agree exists or not as widely as is often assumed.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;spirituality are
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; professional affiliation, or simply like the music, atmosphere and wine.
</em><br>
<p>Some of us don't buy that the future we dream of can be acheived
<br>
by only science, technology and a fairly rigidly defined
<br>
rationality.  We are after any and all means that are a help and
<br>
especially after a unifying vision.  
<br>
<p>Some of us are there because we grok the deep transcendent
<br>
energy present and the caring openness and find it a very
<br>
fertile place to sow extropian memes.  &lt;g&gt;
<br>
<p>It really isn't an either/or im my book and experience.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unless and until those who petition their particular religions views to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impede the direction, progress and accomplishments of extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanist views, the only war is within the domain of rigidity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Or vice versa.
