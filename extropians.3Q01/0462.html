<p>I too liked Teddy too. I expect to see massive Teddy merchandising this

summer with chatbot technology.

<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; I'm an easy mark for any movie that goes that far out into the future.  As
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; I thought the bit where they downloaded David's memories and instantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; shared them by touching each other was kind of cool.  But at the same time I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was thinking &quot;what, hundreds of years into the future and we still haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perfected the wireless network?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2000 years.  And, 'bandwidth'.  If David's mind takes 10^14 bytes, touching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (they seemed made out of optical material, after all) could be more effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than blatting through the air.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plus, it makes it clearer to the audience what's going on.
</em><br>
<p>Thats right. 
<br>
<p>My own review:
<br>
I took my parents with me to see what reaction a couple folks in their
<br>
60's would have, one of whom is a devouted catholic, the other is an
<br>
engineer.
<br>
<p>Mum loved Teddy, saying he was the one redeeming character in the movie,
<br>
otherwise,&quot;It was the absolutly most idiotic and unrealistic movie I'd
<br>
ever seen, it isn't even good as a fairy tale&quot;, in her words. She also
<br>
liked when Gigolo Joe would snap his head to start playing background
<br>
music. I think her Catholic sensibilities were repelled at the idea of
<br>
robots being used as sex toys...
<br>
<p>Dad thought it was 'an interesting look at what could happen', and
<br>
likewise liked Teddy, but wasn't very impressed otherwise.
<br>
<p>As for myself, I thought it was a very good movie, and the special
<br>
effects were very tasteful and apt. What I didn't like was that I didn't
<br>
see Monica and Henry as being very good characterizations. Her sudden
<br>
conversion to 'imprint' David was not realistic, especially, and her
<br>
abandonment of David was not believable. I imagine that one or two
<br>
scenes of Henry demanding David be gotten rid of after the pool incident
<br>
likely wound up on the cutting room floor. This was IMHO a bad decision
<br>
in editing.
<br>
<p>Other criticisms: when David arrives at Prof. Hobby's office, his whole
<br>
breakdown is unrealistic, or demonstrates a huge blunder on the part of
<br>
Hobby in his design. I think that considering that the plans for the
<br>
David design were to mass produce him for millions of childless
<br>
families, it was a stupendously stupid move to not embed him with a
<br>
means of rationally dealing with other Davids that he might meet in the
<br>
future. Also, Hobby's strategy of dropping that riddle into the Dr. Know
<br>
network as the only clue to lead David home, subjecting him to the
<br>
problems of the world strike me as heinously negligent and downright
<br>
cruel, especially given that Hobby and his associates were discussing
<br>
their responsibility in the very first scene of the movie.
<br>
Moreover, the idea that a computer like David would be so flawed as to
<br>
believe so strongly in a fairy tale is completely unbelievable.
