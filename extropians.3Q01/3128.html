<p>Good quality paintballs actually contain a mixture of dye and soap that will
<br>
quickly fade in UV and are very soluble in water, but it is a lot harder to
<br>
clean up if you let the stuff bake on for a couple months.  They are
<br>
completely non-toxic and biodegradable, being manufactured out of exactly
<br>
the same gelatin used to package pharmaceuticals.  Paintball manufacturing
<br>
is actually done as a lucrative sideline business for companies that make
<br>
liquid gel capsules (it doesn't really exist as a separate business),
<br>
replacing the medicine with the dye solution.
<br>
<p>Chalk filled munitions have already been invented, and for small arms, they
<br>
are called Simunitions, and can be fired out of real guns.  They are
<br>
frequently used for police training.
<br>
<p>The military has been using chalk munitions for years in all sorts of
<br>
projectile launching devices.  I vividly remember trying to chalk
<br>
jackrabbits with grenade launchers.  It is essentially impossible to hit one
<br>
(I never saw it done), but if you are lucky you can powder it up real well.
<br>
Pink rabbits really *do* exist...
