<em>&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Olga Bourlin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:fauxever@sprynet.com?Subject=RE:%20SOCIETY:%20Re:%20The%20privatization%20of%20public%20security%20in%20South%20Am%20erica&In-Reply-To=&lt;9D167F53998DD411805700D0B776468F01F9A192@zeus.esavio.com&gt;">fauxever@sprynet.com</a>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I personally don't understand the trust libertarians in general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;seem to put on &quot;the individual.&quot;  I don't recall reading of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;time in our history (U.S. history) when libertarianism was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;supposedly in bloom, and when peace, prosperity and goodwill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;reigned.  If there was such a time (a better time for citizens in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the U.S., compared to recent years), I'd like to know when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that time was.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There was no &quot;golden age of Libertarianism&quot;, and individualism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarianism are completely different.
</em><br>
<p>As far as the trust issue, I do believe that history shows nation/states as
<br>
being the purveyors of millions of deaths via wars, genocide, etc... Also,
<br>
governments ARE a collection of individuals, just given the power of using
<br>
legalized force. My question is, why would anyone trust governments given
<br>
their history?
<br>
<p>Also, the closest we come to a &quot;golden age of libertarianism&quot; is that period
<br>
of time here in the IS from the country's founding to about 1900. A nation
<br>
with nothing but trees, rivers, and rocks was turned into the wealthiest
<br>
nation of all time! Why didn't this happen elsewhere? What is it that we had
<br>
more then anyone else on the planet (don't even try the slave point, other
<br>
countries had FAR more then we did)? I put forth freedom. Yes, it wasn't
<br>
complete, and there were still government distortions of the market, but
<br>
that was minimal. I recently heard a quote im going to adapt. &quot;Only an
<br>
intellectual could evade the fact that countries with more freedom tend to
<br>
be wealthier and more peaceful&quot;.
