<br>
Four weeks.
<br>
<p>But the figure for hours worked per week is over 44 hours per week. 
<br>
<p>So we get (52 - 4) x 44 = 2112 hours per year worked, assuming no sick
<br>
time (there's no entitlement to automatic sick time in the UK).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If Brits take four weeks of vacation a year, that means the average work

</em><br>

</em><br>

<br>
Yeah, which is why this study is bogus; the actual hours worked are 
<br>
quite a lot higher than that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So either the British are deeply, pathologically, ill -- taking 25% of
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, now thats another interesting take. How many sick days a year do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get over there? Since its a fact that people with cheaper health care
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will use it far more frequently (irrespective of whether they get sick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more often), I'd expect that Brits take at least a few more sick days a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year than Americans.
</em><br>
<p>Probably not. There's no statutory sick time; or rather, while you're off
<br>
sick, the social security system kicks in with some statutory sick pay
<br>
and your employer is supposed to make up the difference. As SSP has been
<br>
falling behind the wages index for a few decades, it's now down to less
<br>
than 30% of the average income. People in most jobs don't have health
<br>
insurance, so if they're off sick, they lose pay.
