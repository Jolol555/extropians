<em>&gt;From: &quot;Bill Douglass&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:bill_douglass@onebox.com?Subject=Re:%20fw:%20the%20week%20from%20British%20eyes&In-Reply-To=&lt;200109191509.IAA19596@well.com&gt;">bill_douglass@onebox.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;I share with you here a letter I got from a friend, a Scottish
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fellow in his early thirties, with many years experience in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trenches of international aid, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I had asked him for his candid opinion of 9.11 and its aftermath. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm posting what he wrote back on 9.15.  I don't agree with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everything he says, but I think the letter is good enough to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worth reading and considering.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>My comments on your friend's letter follows.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;George W is not regarded highly at all. The fear, is that a man
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with such minuscule worldly experience (to put it mildly), will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;precipitate something even worse.
</em><br>
<p>The president is surrounded by some of the finest advisers in the
<br>
world. His big advantage is that he is smart enough to listen to
<br>
them. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There is no suggestion that such horrific crimes could ever go
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unpunished, but concern that the punishment will be along the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lines of 'Hoo'ah, lets kick some ass'; To declare &quot;war&quot; on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorism will only encourage recruits for terrorism - it makes it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;almost legal.  George W is seen as too ready to take the law into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his own hands, to do his bit for the people, but unwittingly start
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WW3.
</em><br>
<p>Let's not rush to judgement. It's been a week now since war was
<br>
declared on the United States, we could have struck out in minutes,
<br>
we are still formulating a response.
<br>
<p>This is war, normal legal channels do not apply.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;America is not necessarily seen worldwide as a beacon of liberty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but as a beacon of greed and a military bully that undermines
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other cultures. 
</em><br>
<p>Care for an evaluation on British history?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In the long term an adjustment of foreign policy (like blind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;support of Israel, regardless of the hypocritical actions it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;carries out against the Palestinians) to try and diffuse this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hatred would be a good long term investment. 
</em><br>
<p>The U.S. does not support Israel &quot;blindly&quot;, Israel hears about it
<br>
loud and in no-nonsense terms everytime they do something we don't
<br>
approve of.
<br>
<p>When was the last time Palestinian supporters said boo about
<br>
Palestinian terrorism.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;(It has even been mentioned that maybe now America will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand British anger at continued american support for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;IRA....more people have been killed by the IRA - proportionate to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;population -than the Manhattan and Pentagon atrocities, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Britain did not declare war on Ireland, the IRA or even America
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for often harboring the terrorists).  If it is not this view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the 'Imperialist west', then what has the West and America in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particular done to incur such hatred?
</em><br>
<p>And what about the Unionists?
<br>
<p>This is the single biggest crock I've ever heard. Britain most
<br>
certainly did declare war on Ireland, by deed if not by
<br>
proclamation. It continues this war to this day.
<br>
<p>Who are the biggest supporters of Ireland in America? The millions
<br>
of descendants of those who were forced to flee. Although even
<br>
those like myself who have Welsh/British/Scottish/Irish ancestors
<br>
see Britain as totally wrong when it comes to Ireland.
<br>
<p>Want to end the &quot;troubles&quot;? I can do it for you.
<br>
<p>1) U.N. Declaration: &quot;The territory known as Northern Ireland is
<br>
hearby recognized as part of Ireland, subject to its laws, and no
<br>
other nation.&quot;
<br>
<p>2) Remove British troops occupying Northern Ireland, replace with
<br>
U.N. peacekeepers. Make it clear to both sides that terrorism is
<br>
outlawed and will be treated/prosecuted equally.
<br>
<p>3) British subjects who wish to remain in Northern Ireland are
<br>
granted dual citizenship and permanent residency status.
<br>
<p>There done, but I'll bet you don't approve of the result.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;But time and time again in articles and letters, is the repeated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need to observe the international rule of law and use it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deliver a &quot;proportionate, discriminate, but lethal blow to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;held responsible&quot;. Is it fair that Afghans or Iraqis feel the need
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to prepare their country for war, or flee their country en masse?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Is an eye for an eye the correct response?
</em><br>
<p>This was an act of war, and International standards of war apply.
<br>
You may wish to inform the other combatants that they are already
<br>
in gross violation of such standards.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;You may remember I have some personal experience of terrorism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;first hand.  Personally, on a one to one basis, I would have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happy to be locked in a room with the person responsible, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;either understand him and/or beat him to a pulp. But I would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;run a mile, rather than agree that the correct response would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been anything other than a mighty blow against his (proven)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorist organization and its leader.
</em><br>
<p>I have no first-hand knowledge of what you are speaking of here,
<br>
and so respectfully refrain from comment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Tuesday's acts were not an act of war but criminal acts on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;horrifying scale. A 'warlike' response is not justified. To Joe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bloggs here, $20 billion is a huge amount to start a campaign,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unless starting a 'war footing. But wars involve campaigns to gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control of territories and populations with clearly identifiable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protagonists....two wrongs do not make a right.
</em><br>
<p>But three lefts do....
<br>
<p>Contrary to your opinion, the U.S. recognizes what happened as an
<br>
act of War. The standards of war apply.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&quot;Nobody doubts America's power to visit unimaginable violence on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;others. But to what end? The people are rightly angry, but surely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not stupid. They can distinguish determination from vengeance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;caution from appeasement, acts of will from acts of lunacy&quot;. Heart
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must not rule head in an issue that could unleash carnage on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scale that would drive America back behind barriers and borders
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for a generation or more.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, which is why our yet to be determined act should be to
<br>
destroy those responsible while doing everything possible to
<br>
prevent civilian casualties. This could be followed by
<br>
international efforts to root out terrorism and restore order.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The statesman's job is not to rant but to think - the reason Brits
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are a little uneasy with the US leadership. Reasoned action is one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thing, but weakness is the thing that jerks the knee and drops The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bomb. After all, suicidal madmen and lunatics are not 'deterred'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A great assault on any Muslim state from the air will be an answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to a prayer for Bin Laden and his like. The Manhattan slaughter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would almost be legitimized in some people's eyes. Furthermore,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the British empire 'met its Waterloo' in Afghanistan, as did the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Russians....are the Americans about to follow?
</em><br>
<p>We don't have an &quot;empire&quot; and our &quot;Waterloo&quot; was probably Vietnam.
<br>
<p>I suggest we wait to actually see U.S. military response before
<br>
commenting further.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Enough political observation my friend(s). This is the mood over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here.  A little nervous, especially as politically and militarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we stand side by side with you guys; especially difficult as in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effect we are bystanders to the decisions the US leadership will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take, but thereafter will be  involved.
</em><br>
<p>If you choose to be, which is where I give you guys/gals immense
<br>
credit. Having served with SAS personnal I know we make a good
<br>
team.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The Britons have been attacked by (and have attacked) pretty well
</em><br>
<em>&gt;every historical marauder that lived. But we are still here. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thank everything we believe in that we have our life and health
</em><br>
<em>&gt;today, that we have not been direct witness to the appalling and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;needless destruction of this week and continue to hold you in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thoughts. As many people have said, if this is the world we live
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in, may God have mercy on us. It cannot and must not continue, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likewise, the west cannot declare war on anyone other than those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;directly and proven responsible. May this week be something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never to be seen again in our lifetime. May the response when it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comes,be something applauded worldwide as the right thing to do,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not the trigger to the destruction of the world that we know.
</em><br>
<p>We agree here and we appreciate the support. If the world chooses
<br>
to act together after this we can solve the problem.
