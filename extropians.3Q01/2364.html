From: &quot;Alex F. Bokov&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:alexboko@umich.edu?Subject=Re:%20Our%20Responsibility%20to%20Those%20in%20Need&In-Reply-To=&lt;005101c116f7$d790d190$cf2179a5@braniac&gt;">alexboko@umich.edu</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Jim Crow era was really a fight between the liberal Federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government and certain reactionary state governments. While it does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cast doubt on the Republican &quot;State's Rights&quot; doctrine it only lends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support to anarcho-libertarianism, because if there weren't any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments passing irrational laws in the first place, intervention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from an even higher level of government would not have been necessary.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, sure, but the monster was already alive, big, and growing.  Maybe if
<br>
there was no slavery ... maybe if ...
<br>
<p>But the fact remains, segregation in the South at mid-century was already
<br>
knee-deep in monsters, and after hundreds of years of that sad legacy
<br>
something more drastic needed to happen other than just letting things drift
<br>
along until people smartened up and entrepreneurship to solve everyone's
<br>
problems could get a foothold.  The problems facing the South (and the
<br>
U.S.A.) were monumental.  Maybe if the monster didn't exist in the first
<br>
place ... but even that's theoretical.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &gt; Libertarians don't favor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; outlawing stupidity, but stupidity should have its costs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It does, by definition, except when some do-gooder authority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decides to redistribute these costs and protect the stupid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the consequences of their actions.
</em><br>
<p>I would rather deal with a do-gooder authority than a do-badder authority.
<br>
