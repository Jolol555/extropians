<em>&gt;From: Loree Thomas &lt;<a href="mailto:loreetg@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20Vicious%20Racism&In-Reply-To=&lt;F266mLAztxc1o8yfogk00004e35@hotmail.com&gt;">loreetg@yahoo.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;Have you experienced discrimination?  Did you have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overcome racism to be successful, or was simply making
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the correct choices enough?
</em><br>
<p>Well I almost hate to say it because I know some will make idealogical hay 
<br>
of it but, no.  I mean growing up as a black kid in a mostly white school I 
<br>
endured my share of hostilities.  But when it came to occupational 
<br>
opportunity I really had my pick of the litter.
<br>
<p>Being educated, intelligent and black I've never had any problem finding a 
<br>
decent job.  I've had more than one employer tell me that hiring me was like 
<br>
killing two birds with one stone - they get a competent employee and they 
<br>
get to put their &quot;equal opportunity&quot; money where their mouth is at the same 
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>I was never the beneficiary of any specific affirmative action program.  But 
<br>
I'm sure I benefitted from the affirmative action political atmosphere which 
<br>
made it a corporate liability to not have at least one minority on salary.
<br>
<p>Which brings me back to the reparations discussion which started this whole 
<br>
thing in the first place.  For the record, I would be opposed to any 
<br>
reparations plan from which I would benefit.  If reparations are to be paid, 
<br>
I think it would be a mockery to let people (regardless of their race) who 
<br>
are not in economic distress benefit from it.
<br>
<p>If you really want to kindle racial hatred, then just let the goverment hand 
<br>
out windfalls to already wealthy blacks while there are still white folks on 
<br>
welfare!  Let the race wars begin!
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
