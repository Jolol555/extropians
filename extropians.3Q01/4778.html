Some Americans on this list wonder why there does seem to be
<br>
rather strong anti-American sentiment expressed here from time
<br>
to time.  Examples aren't really hard to find, and even among
<br>
the most rational posters, sometimes their resentment toward
<br>
America leaks out.
<br>
<p>Americans should probably try to do a little bit better modeling
<br>
of what's probably going on in our overseas friends' minds.  It
<br>
seems perfectly understandable to me that if your newspapers,
<br>
television, and radio were constantly bombarding you with a lot
<br>
of nonsense traceable to one particular locale on Earth, you
<br>
couldn't help but get kind of annoyed at that place.  I think 
<br>
that it was Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada who once said that
<br>
trying to properly anticipate shifts in the Canadian economy was,
<br>
thanks to their gigantic neighbor, a bit like being in bed with
<br>
an elephant.  Well, the same thing is true of culture, or in the
<br>
case of Western civilization, lack of culture.
<br>
<p>But on the other hand, non-U.S. posters to this list might try
<br>
being a little more sympathetic to Americans.  Sure, if you do
<br>
give voice to some annoyances or resentments, you can naturally
<br>
inspire an almost automatic defense mechanism.  Isn't that to
<br>
be expected??  But try to imagine actually having to *live*
<br>
(at least conceptually) in the same country as Madonna, Mr. T.,
<br>
Pat Robertson, tobacco farmers, Bill Clinton, Baywatch and McBeal
<br>
TV, Microsoft, and so on, and not have a lovely huge ocean
<br>
separating you from all that!  That would be no picnic either!
<br>
Surely any foreign person of refinement and taste will, if
<br>
he or she stops to think about it, be rather grateful that
<br>
most of these noxious influences can be thought of as *over
<br>
there* rather than *right here*.  Try to understand that for
<br>
those of us living here---and being completely unable to do
<br>
anything at all about some of these baleful phenomena---
<br>
having also a comfortable standard of living is only just
<br>
compensation.
