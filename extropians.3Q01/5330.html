</em><br>
<p>Well, they obviously have human interests (those of their stockholders)
<br>
at heart. They just don't have much of all humans' interests at heart.
<br>
If you don't like the interests expressed by a particular company, buy
<br>
out its stockholders... thats how everybody else does it.

<p>The definition of a liberal is one who is so fair minded that he/she
<br>
won't even defend their own opinion. In this respect, the test you
<br>
pointed us to seemed more like an entrance exam to the Consolidated
<br>
Communist/Green/Black Panther/Feminazi Party.
