You are accusing me of using circular reasoning. Not once did I ever say
<br>
&quot;nothing&quot; is true. Granted, if I said nothing was true but intended that
<br>
very statement itself to be true, as if it is true there are no truths,
<br>
indeed I would have spoken a contradiction. I did not say that. I did
<br>
not imply that. You are reading your own stuff into what I said.
<br>
<p>I am a great believer in truth. I just do not believe it is the same
<br>
truth all the time or in all situations. Truth is relative. Realism is
<br>
an attempt to say at least some truths are not relative. If a person
<br>
takes the time to strictly specify context, and if a person gives
<br>
repeated example within that same context, I admit things should not
<br>
change. But as I have said already, people assume consistent context
<br>
when in fact such is not always the case. This is an error in logic.
<br>
Realism is the logical fallacy of universal context, when in fact there
<br>
is no such thing.
<br>
<p>Again you have failed to justify your criticism of what I said.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;You made the asked us, in your Sunday, August 26, 2001 12:00 PM post, to:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Consider each fact we hold dear in terms of the sociological environment in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;place at the time that fact came into being. Consider whatever political and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religious controversies. The point is, any arbitrary fact or piece of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge could have been constructed at that time, and what was constructed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;met the demand and dynamic nature of that environment. If constructed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge proves useful, can be built upon, or in some other way exhibits
</em><br>
<em>&gt;survivability, that knowledge remains. If not it goes away and is superseded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by something else. The knowledge we have exhibits the exploratory and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adaptive nature of mankind. We manufacture knowledge to meet our needs and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wants rather than discover it.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There are several claims made in this quote.  Let's separate them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One is that &quot;any arbitrary fact or piece of knowledge could have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;constructed at that time...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Another is &quot;what was constructed met the demand and dynamic nature of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;environment.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Following all this is &quot;We manufacture knowledge to meet our needs and wants
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather than discover it.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now this last claims is an time of knowledge, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Is it true?  If it is true, then it must apply to itself, right?  If so,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then it must be manufactured and not discovered.  Yet knowledge that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manufactured is really not knowledge at all.  Instead, it merely suits some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other purpose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or do you mean your statement to apply to only some subset of knowledge?  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that case, then we could focus on the subset that it does not apply to.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fact, if it only applies to a subset, then the claim is much less bold and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;becomes a truism.  (Just like &quot;Some of what you believe right now is false.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Does this statement mean anything goes or that everything you believe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;false?  Or that there's no way of separating truth from falsehood -- however
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rough or fallible?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If it is false, then your whole rant is false.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But even more to the point, how would you know it is true?  You would need
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to know something about reality and something about knowledge of reality?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why would you need to know?  To even make sense of the statement, you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be able to compare a given item of knowledge to reality and show that a)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it enhance survival or is otherwise useful and b) that it does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessarily match reality.  Usefulness is a fact, too, as is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;survivability.&quot;  In order to know if something is useful, one must have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some knowledge of the things it's useful for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;All these claims commit the genetic fallacy -- or what Rand called the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fallacy of the stolen concept.  (You don't have to accept her other views to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accept this fallacy as a true fallacy in reasoning.)  This means, simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;put, an idea which denies that on which it logically depends.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; That a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; person uses semantics to criticise semantics is in no way invalid. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; do you suggest I use?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I suggest you clean up your logic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I ask you again to justify your criticism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Again, I have.  That Lee Corbin number my criticisms seems to show someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;else got it too.  (It would also be nice if you followed his formating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggestions.  It would make it easier for others to read your posts.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Cheers!
