I just joined this list after Amara Angelica from KurzweilAI pointed out
<br>
that there was some talk about GAC in this group. I've looked at some of the
<br>
posts and would like to make some comments:
<br>
<p>1 - GAC is a black box. I have made no disclosures on what it uses for
<br>
pattern matching (not that it should matter if you place any value in the
<br>
Turing Test which bars knowledge of the internals of a system.) But, I am
<br>
doing experiments now with SOMs and SRNs.
<br>
<p>2 - The primary purpose of GAC is to build a fitness test for humanness in a
<br>
binary response domain. This will in the future allow GAC to babysit a truly
<br>
evolving artificial consciousness, rewarding and punishing it as needed at
<br>
machine speeds.
<br>
<p>2.5 - The key to evolving anything is the fitness test. If I want to evolve
<br>
a picture of the Mona Lisa, then I need a fitness test for the Mona Lisa. A
<br>
good fitness test for the Mona Lisa would be a copy of an image of the Mona
<br>
Lisa. To rate the quality of an evolving picture, I would just need to
<br>
compare pixels. The next best thing to using an image would be   random
<br>
sample of pixels; the larger the sample, the better will be the evolved
<br>
copy. Right now, GAC is a 50,000+ term fitness test for humanness. At each
<br>
one of those points GAC knows what it should expect it were testing an
<br>
average human, because for each one of those points GAC has made at least 20
<br>
measurements of real people.
<br>
<p>3 - Any contradictions in GAC are real contradictions in us. It can't
<br>
believe anything that hasn't been confirmed by at least 20 people.
<br>
<p>4 - GAC is science. Over 8 million actual measurements of human consensus
<br>
have been made. There are at least two other projects that claim to be
<br>
collecting human consensus information - CYC and Open Mind - neither has
<br>
actually done the science to verify that what is in their databases is
<br>
actually consensus human fact. It's all hearsay until the each item is
<br>
presented to at least 20 people (central limit theorem.)
