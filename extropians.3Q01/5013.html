<p><em>    &gt; W.J. Sidis is an anomalous example.  You can be highly

<p>This discussion was about how well high IQ correlated with success in life, you've
<br>
listed some (but not all) reasons why this often fails, but it does not change the fact
<br>
that it has failed. More generally, It would be remarkable if the most complex thing
<br>
known, intelligence, could be measured with just one number, you need 2 just to
<br>
measure something as simple as the wind, one for speed and one for direction.
<br>
I imagine that for a good measure of intelligence you'd need a Tensor, and a big one.
