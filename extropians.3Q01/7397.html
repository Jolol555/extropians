<p>As I said before, in a more heated moment, the technology you're
<br>
looking for is called propoganda.
<br>
<p>This particular ilk of terrorists don't care about survival, don't care
<br>
about comfort, but they do care about respect. About their reputation
<br>
among their people. We may not understand what their people respect and
<br>
don't respect, but it's time to start learning and using that knowledge
<br>
to make them look like cowards, weaklings, fools, and perverts.
<br>
<p>Another problem is meme deployment. Many of the countries harboring
<br>
terrorists know their Acchilles heel and take great pains to isolate
<br>
themselves culturally. If American business or media can find any
<br>
foothold there, though, we can use that to start sowing the seeds of
<br>
rationality, autonomy, and enjoying Earthly life rather than
<br>
sacrificing everything for the sake of the thereafter.
<br>
<p>It wasn't military force that won the Cold War, after all. It was
<br>
bluejeans, Big-Macs, and Hollywood movies. Forget bombs. Drop
<br>
humanitarian supplies. Bags of extra-spicy pork rinds. Porno
<br>
mags. Gangsta-rap CDs. Bibles in comic-book format. Refurbished
<br>
computers with wireless uplinks. Let them fight amongst themselves for
<br>
the loot, or let it all get 'confiscated' by the Towelban, eroding
<br>
their public support. Win-win either way, and probably still cheaper
<br>
than our high-end munitions. Let the memewar begin.
<br>
<p>Of course, rational optimists envision the best but prepare for the
<br>
worst.  The worst to prepare for is IMO groundwar in Afghanistan and
<br>
fascism at home for the next decade, followed by a defeatist cultural
<br>
backlash and an ever expanding network of enemies abroad. My question
<br>
to you, my favorite think-tank, is how do we prepare for *that*? How
<br>
do we prevent a downfall or at least slowing down of civilization, or
<br>
that failing, how do we protect ourselves and our projects from such
<br>
a downfall?
