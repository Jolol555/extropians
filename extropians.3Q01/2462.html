<p>Olinka's Law?
<br>
<p>I, and many others think the second option is pluperfectly wonderful. We
<br>
don't automatically distrust other individuals (or themselves) who are
<br>
not shielded by the mantle of the state from responsibility for their
<br>
actions. Collateral damage only exists for those who insist on
<br>
parasitizing on others without permission. 
<br>
<p>It always seems to me that those who think the worst of others are
<br>
merely projecting their own darkest fantasies about what 'they would do'
<br>
if free to act, automatically assuming not only that everyone else has
<br>
similar fanatasies, but that they are similarly unable to restrain them
<br>
in virtue. They thus demand the authority and power to restrain others
<br>
when it is they who need the most restraining, especially once they
<br>
attain any power greater than the responsibility of the individual for
<br>
themselves.
