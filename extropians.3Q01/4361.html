<em>&gt;Carlos, I fail to see the problem.  If one has money, one is at risk of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being kidnaped.  Therefor, if one can afford a bulletproof car and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other technologies, why would one *not* buy such things?  Under these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circs, if one does not take all available precautions, one is partly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;responsible for ones own fate.  What they really need is some means
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of firing back at those doing the shooting, not just bulletproof cars.  spike
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
And I very much agree with all you say. The problem is not one of
<br>
availability of security techs to the upper classes, which is clearly
<br>
beneficial in many ways. The problem is that, under the mentioned
<br>
circumstances, the upper classes can give up on public security and
<br>
take refuge on their ability to purchase all this security techs and
<br>
services, while most of the middle classes and all the lower classes
<br>
get stuck with a public security that in many cases is as bad as the
<br>
criminals themselves. The upper classes can therefore afford a kind
<br>
of safety the rest of us can't. This creates yet another perceived
<br>
gap between the few that have benefited in the last 20 years and the
<br>
rest of the population. In a social context in which such gaps are
<br>
already horrid, IMHO it is very unwise to add yet another new kind
<br>
of it to the mix.
<br>
<p>Carlos
