It's all about brain wiring: Painters, composers, poets find new neural

<p>The V5 Complex
<br>
<p>In an article in the latest issue of the journal Science, Semir Zeki proposed
<br>
a new field of science -- neuroesthetics -- which would study the relationship
<br>
between art and the brain.
<br>
<p>Study of Art Gives Insight Into Brain's Structure
<br>
<a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010705/sc/science_brain_dc_1.html">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010705/sc/science_brain_dc_1.html</a>
<br>
``Visual art obeys the laws of the visual brain, and thus reveals these laws
<br>
to us,'' he wrote.
<br>
<p>Artists have a way of tapping into the parts of the brain that are stimulated
<br>
by art, said Zeki, a professor of neurobiology at University College London.
<br>
<p>``In a sense they're also studying the brain, but with a different technique,
<br>
the technique of painting,'' he said in a telephone interview.
<br>
<p>Scientists are just beginning to use art to uncover how the brain pieces
<br>
together images into a coherent picture.
<br>
<p>The work of processing of images occurs in the visual cortex, which makes up
<br>
one-quarter of the brain.
<br>
<p>To examine the cortex, Zeki used functional magnetic resonance imaging and
<br>
*transcranial electronic stimulation*, which temporarily shuts down portions
<br>
of the brain so that other portions may be studied.
<br>
<p>By monitoring individual cells in the brain while showing patients samples of
<br>
art, scientists have pinpointed regions that respond to motion, color and
<br>
shapes.
<br>
<p>But artists discovered these areas unknowingly many years earlier, Zeki said.
<br>
<p>He gave the example of kinetic artists, like Alexander Calder, whose works of
<br>
the mid-1900s focused on motion while minimizing the use of color and shapes.
<br>
<p>``Their work should have predicted that there was an area of the brain that
<br>
does that, only scientists found it many years later,'' he said. This area
<br>
became known as the V5 complex.
<br>
<p>Zeki's research now concentrates on how and when the various regions of the
<br>
visual brain are triggered.
<br>
<p>Scientists once thought that parts of the visual brain react simultaneously,
<br>
but Zeki's current research is showing that some areas respond faster to
<br>
stimuli than others. V4, which responds to color, reacts faster than V5, the
<br>
motion center, Zeki said.
<br>
<p>Someday scientists will be able to see whether artists' brains are different
<br>
than everybody else's, Zeki said. And further study might be able to predict
<br>
children with the talent to be the next Picasso or Michelangelo.
<br>
<p>``A lot of it depends on level of technology and level of resolution. I think
<br>
if we're able to get to a high enough level of spatial and temporal
<br>
resolution, we'll be able to detect differences, and no doubt there are,'' he
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>Zeki lectures regularly at the Slade School of Art in London and said artists
<br>
are curious about the correlation between art and the brain.
<br>
<p>``I think they're interested in the apparatus that produces their work, which
<br>
is the brain,'' he said. ``I'm not sure they change their style, they
<br>
certainly change their views.''

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
