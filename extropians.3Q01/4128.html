<em>&gt; Hi all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've been following the transhuman term debate over the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few days and I just wanted to ask a different slant on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea of being transhuman.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From speaking to several on the list about why they want to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman, the overwhelming theme has been about having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better functionality. but I was wondering if anyone out there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had any other reasons for wanting to be a transhuman. Does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone see it as a form of self expression, i.e. like in body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modification (I think Anders essay on Self transformtion goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into this). The cyborg debates in academia centre on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cyborg, or machine human integration, as potentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transgressive. For example, being androgenous, potentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breaking such dualisms and boundaries as gender, mind and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body, race, stigma against disability, difference and so on. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wondered if anyone had any thoughts on this. Do any of you see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these as possibilites in the future or do you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traditional boundaries will remain as long as traditional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; institutions remain?
</em><br>
<p>I don't transgress boundaries generally just because I enjoy
<br>
transgressing boundaries, though one does begin to enjoy it
<br>
after a while.  I transgress boundaries when they are in the way
<br>
of my full unfoldment, happiness and/or well-being.  I
<br>
&quot;transgressed&quot; gender, sexual expectations, &quot;how things are
<br>
done&quot; in my career, boundaries pro or anti-spiritual realms and
<br>
so on all for the same reason.  And I plan to transgress other
<br>
boundaries defining the supposed limits of human or what is
<br>
*natural* as quickly as I am able to and as I feel the need.  
<br>
<p>Institutions are wavering and disassembling in the waves of
<br>
change and uncertainty.  The boundaries are forms that may or
<br>
may not fit you or me at some point in time.  The institutions
<br>
shift as the people shift.  And the people shift as the
<br>
institutions shift.
