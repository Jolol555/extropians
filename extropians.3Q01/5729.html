<p>Care to elaborate on that?
<br>
<p>It's been a long time since I read some of his stuff and found his version
<br>
of egoism to skirt a little too closely with the mainstream view of it as
<br>
basically trampling on others.  He sort of seems to me to slip into egoism
<br>
of the Nietzschean sort -- worship your feelings.  Don't you think he more
<br>
likely got this from Nietzsche and, perhaps, Crowley?
<br>
<p>Rand definitely was influenced by Nietzsche, but she did &quot;Aristoteleanize&quot;
<br>
this, especially after _The Fountainhead_.
<br>
<p>If anyone's interested in Rand and Objectivism, I recommend starting NOT
<br>
with her novels, BUT with _The Virtue of Selfishness_, a collection of
<br>
essays by her and Nathaniel Branden on ethics.  After that, read perhaps
<br>
_Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology_ and her other nonfiction.
<br>
Starting with her (and her circle's) nonfiction means a lot less reading, if
<br>
nothing else.:)
<br>
<p>Also, of note is Thomas Gramstad's &quot;POP Culture&quot; web site at

those around him what man lives for, what is the meaning of his existence.

To explain to people the reason for their appearance on this planet; or if
<br>
not to explain, at least to pose the question.&quot;  - Andrey Tarkovsky
