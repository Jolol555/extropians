In response to my comment
<br>
<em>&gt; By the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people (or at least I) will be willing to move in, the resolution will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as good as you want.  But someone will  have to have made a choice about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which moment in the lifetime of the rock to recreate, and at what rate to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let it erode, if at all.
</em><br>

<br>
<em>&gt; That &quot;someone&quot; will be you. And you can, if you want, climb a simulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mountain that is an exact, down to every little micro-crack, copy of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current mountain on the real Earth in realtime. In other words you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; import the real world in its current state into your VR, no problemo.
</em><br>
<p>But if I can do all of that, what would be the point of it?  If and when
<br>
the attractions of life within are too great, I'll give up my old ways. 
<br>
But I like the reality of life as it is.  I won't be going in because I
<br>
can climb different mountains, or because I can choose to climb any
<br>
mountain at any point in its history.  I surely won't go in and select
<br>
the &quot;potentially fatal consequences&quot; version.  I'll go in because that's
<br>
where the people are, or that's where the interesting challenges are. 
<br>
But I predict that when I do, I'll stop climbing.  I accept the
<br>
&quot;potentially fatal consequences&quot; because it's inseparably part of the
<br>
experience.  It's a reinforcement to keep a certain kind of honesty as
<br>
you climb.  When I climb indoors, that rule is suspended, and that makes
<br>
it a very different sport.
<br>
<p>For those of you have are familiar with Marc Stiegler's &quot;The Gentle
<br>
Seduction&quot;, I've read the story and I believe that it's a reasonable
<br>
model of how the world will change.  (Remember that the central
<br>
character is also a lover of mountains.)  If you haven't read it yet,
<br>
hold tight.  I've been working on Marc to post it on FictionWise or some
<br>
other such place where you can buy it in soft copy, since it's out of
<br>
print on paper.  This is a short story that is on most lists of
<br>
extropian classics.
