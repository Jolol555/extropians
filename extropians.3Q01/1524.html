From: &quot;Lee Corbin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20capitalist%20religion&In-Reply-To=&lt;01de01c110e8$91ebeea0$ed5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; However, the real reason that I oppose government confiscation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the wealth of the prudent to finance the needs of those whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives haven't worked out for some reason, is evolutionary:
</em><br>
<p>Seems as likely to me that government confiscates the meager wealth of those
<br>
whose lives haven't worked out for some reason, and uses it to finance the
<br>
needs of the prudent (who have managed to figure out how to gain access to tax
<br>
dollars, viz., politicians).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Approving of government to pay for everyone's health care, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, seem to me unappreciative of how wealth is created in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first place.
</em><br>
<p>Private sector workers (whose lives often don't work out for some reason)
<br>
create most of the wealth that government in turn redistributes to those
<br>
who've figured our how to avoid work (often by getting government jobs).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Specifically, there seems to be little awareness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary attributes of all those societies that in the past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gradually became wealthy.
</em><br>
<p>The higher they rise, the harder they fall. The evolutionary phase transition,
<br>
with its accompanying upheaval and transformation of entire socio-economic
<br>
systems, augurs to make all previous analyses obsolete, if not irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let us suppose that in the Constitution of &quot;the first new nation&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i.e., the United States, there had been a provision for a minimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guaranteed annual income.  Isn't it clear that many people would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have lost the incentive to contribute?  As it was, there were a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of people who were too lazy, or too wasteful, or lacking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in other positive traits.  But they didn't thrive and people didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look up to them or accept them, and as a result the traditions that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *did* survive were positive ones.  I'm always surprised at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;no fear&quot; attitude of liberals who don't appear---under a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases---to understand how historically important *incentive*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been in people's lives.
</em><br>
<p>The income tax put the brakes on incentive it seems to me. In effect, this tax
<br>
says to young workers and entrepreneurs, &quot;We've got ours, now you'll have to
<br>
pay an extra premium to get even a fraction of what we've got.&quot; The US income
<br>
tax was the beginning of the new class system separating the haves from the
<br>
have-nots.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Later, when our world economy has become so strong that it no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters whether everyone is guaranteed an income of $100,000 or not,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then I will be much less concerned about destroying the traditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of personal responsibility that took so many centuries to evolve.
</em><br>
<p>Personal responsibility takes a back seat to personal greed when it comes to
<br>
accumulating wealth. In fact the concept of responsibility serves the rich
<br>
better than it serves the poor, because the rich can far more easily afford to
<br>
practice it. The most responsible thing a sufficiently intelligent entity can
<br>
do is to provide an example for other sufficiently intelligent entities so
<br>
that they don't commit suicide.
<br>
<p>Unlike socialism, capitalism does not actually require one to make a religion
<br>
of it.
<br>

<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
