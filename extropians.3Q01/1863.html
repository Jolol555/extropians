<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I'd like to live in a world where every person was guaranteed basic food,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;shelter, and medical care.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Well luckily, you are free to help all that you feel could use it, but your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not free to take your crusade to save the world (children, homeless,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crippled, etc....) and make everyone else finance it.
</em><br>
<p>Actually she *is* free to bring about this situation if by brilliance of
<br>
advocacy and canny backroom deals she can persuade a plurality of voters in
<br>
a psephological state to endorse the program of a winning party with this
<br>
option as one of the major planks in its platform. 
<br>
<p>Is this method unendurably wicked? Yes, if the majority of voters are
<br>
persuaded to choose a regime whose declared policies are racist, say, or in
<br>
some other way intolerably criminal. But this is a real world operating on
<br>
realpolitik, and we make minimax adjustments. Heinlein's novels, e.g.,
<br>
often show his doughty individuals paying `squeeze' or even bribes to get
<br>
their way or save their skins. In a world of driven hominids, sometimes
<br>
it's easier all round to pay off the bullies or the officious, educate and
<br>
perhaps conscript their children via the Pure Light of Reason, and keep the
<br>
peace while improving your lot. And sometimes, of course, it's necessary to
<br>
throw up the windows and scream with all your might, `Fuck it, we're not
<br>
putting *up* with this shit any more.' But your neighbors might disagree
<br>
over what precisely constitutes the shit, and decide not to put up with it...
