Olga replied
<br>
&lt;&lt;Gladly.  Public education does not sanction discrimination based on
<br>
religion, ethnicity, class, and what have you (that is to say, it has truly
<br>
become more democratic lately - if only in the last few decades - and, in my
<br>
view, the bulk of good it does by this very fact alone puts it ahead of
<br>
private education).&gt;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;At the risk of being an intolerant asshole (again!)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As it happened I went to a public high school, primarily because
<br>
my parents had (for sound economic reasons) moved to a locality
<br>
where affordable private religous schools were not available.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully the &quot;damage&quot; had already been done. I was already
<br>
educated by the time I went to &quot;secondary&quot; education. I spent
<br>
my elementary years in self-paced highly individualized Baptist
<br>
Xstian ed. It was not discriminatory on the basis of class, but
<br>
had a MASSIVE religous bias. Since most of it's student
<br>
population was drawn from the church population or from
<br>
parents who were highly motivated for their children to
<br>
receive a certain sort of education.... it was also very
<br>
monoethnic.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Public education DOES sanction discrimination, I never had a
<br>
principle who couldn't speak English properly (i.e. correct grammer
<br>
and pronunciation) while attending the &quot;intolerant&quot; private schools,
<br>
I was never assaulted by a gang of toughs in a private school, and
<br>
saw the matter regretfully ignored by the administration. It's
<br>
called &quot;Equal Opportunity&quot;...and it's awful. For everyone.
<br>
You should look into the disparity in performance on teacher's
<br>
examinations and the effects of EO and teacher's unions for
<br>
an eyeopener there.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as education has become more &quot;non-discriminatory&quot; (the
<br>
official version I mean) and &quot;democratic&quot; it has commenced to suck
<br>
more and more.  This is only my opinion and experience speaking.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you honestly believe that not discriminating based on &quot;religion,
<br>
ethnicity, class and what have you&quot; is worth having nearly illiterate
<br>
persons wandering about the Republic, well to be extremely nice
<br>
about it..I'm split between feeling pity and revulsion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discrimination based on religion, and class is very useful. And
<br>
frankly letting private schools discriminate on any other basis,
<br>
including race should they chose to do so, is a wonderful idea.
<br>
If they are at serious odds with reality... then they won't suceed
<br>
in educating as well as those who are more realistic.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately we have a growing homeschooling movement in
<br>
this country (oddly enough largely populated by those same sort
<br>
of intolerant discriminators (usually on the basis of religion) that
<br>
you believe are trumped by the public school system). While
<br>
much of the Xstian faith is utter nonsense, it does have a habit
<br>
of turning out people who are (assuming they hold to their
<br>
own values) hardworking and fairly moral citizens.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think public education is all that... wait 20 years and look
<br>
at the number of homeschooled kids who become professionals.
<br>
Vs. the criminal farms we have now.
