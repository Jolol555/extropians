</em><br>
<p>and HOW is it smuggled in? Not in UPS packages. Successful drug
<br>
smuggling occurs via private shipments, by ship and truck. Given the
<br>
percentage that are caught, if I were a drug lord, I'd purposely make a
<br>
certain percentage of my shipments easier than usual to detect, so the
<br>
DEA could pounce on those to demonstrate that they 'are doing
<br>
something', and which would also cause them to slack off on trying to
<br>
detect real shipments.
<br>
<p>A recent interdiction effort in south america resulted in the seizure of
<br>
a nearly completed submarine, being built high up in the hills. I would
<br>
not doubt that there are already a few operating.

<em>&gt; UPS does not X ray its packages. A few radiation detectors were installed at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of the major border crossings into the USA a few years ago, but a recent
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; It didn't really matter because nobody was trained in their proper operation anyway.
</em><br>
<p>At the current time, drug interdiction is the primary concern, and they
<br>
use dogs to go over every package and vehicle coming over the border. I
<br>
expect that the NSA, et al, expect to detect sigint or humint to provide
<br>
sufficient warning that such operations are imminent, on the grounds
<br>
that you will always find some people in any group who think that nukes
<br>
are beyond the pale.
<br>
<p>Of course, I'd fully expect that our border defenses had crumbled under
<br>
the Clinton administration.
