<p>I think that if you do the math, you will find that the universe has to
<br>
expand just as fast as predicted by the big bang theory to get rid of
<br>
the energy. If you add in continous creation, then it would have to
<br>
expand faster to get rid of the extra mass-energy, which makes it even
<br>
harder to explain structure formation. 
<br>

<em>&gt;   - If old matter is crushed out of existence in black holes then there is 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>If you start throwing out conservation laws, then you are in trouble.
<br>
Then you could just postulate that mass and energy pops into and out of
<br>
existence just as you would like it, and become unfalsifiable.
<br>
<p>Black holes are rather bad at absorbing heat from the surrounding
<br>
universe, since they have small cross sections. Also, since they follow
<br>
the matter distribution this explanation would mean an anisotropic
<br>
background radiation strongly linked to the matter distribution, which
<br>
is not observed to my knowledge. 
<br>
<p>Black hole thermodynamics says that the horizon area of black holes can
<br>
only increase, not decrease. The exception is through Hawking radiation,
<br>
but that requires a surrounding universe with very low temperature and
<br>
density. In a steady state universe the holes would just grow and grow,
<br>
and since you could find black holes of any age, there ought to exist
<br>
not just supermassive holes but black holes of arbitrarily large mass -
<br>
which we have seen no evidence whatsoever for.
<br>
<p>Hmm, thinking of it, the Weyl tensor apparently behaves as a kind of
<br>
gravitational entropy. That really ought to be a problem for steady
<br>
state cosmology; how did Hoyle get around it?
