----------------------------------------
<br>
<p>I beheld the vague, shimmering outlines of titanic entities rippling
<br>
in the distance.
<br>
<p>Their sentience I could sense immediately; their power and purpose
<br>
ruptured all human scales. I could no more comprehend the scope of
<br>
their existence than an amoeba could look back up a microscope and
<br>
fathom the human mind.
<br>
<p>&quot;Are they Gods?&quot; I asked.
<br>
<p>&quot;Your descendents,&quot; said the Caterpillar. &quot;Several million years
<br>
hence.&quot;
<br>
<p>I adjusted the focus to my present time.
<br>
<p>Before me I saw the human family, all 6 billion of us, and I saw quite
<br>
clearly that we were poised on the edge of an evolutionary event as
<br>
signficant as the Cambrian Explosion.
<br>
<p>There would be no &quot;Homo superior.&quot; There would instead be hundreds,
<br>
maybe thousands of new species evolving out of the current human
<br>
population. The segmentations were already appearing; within 100
<br>
years, it would be impossible to speak of &quot;one human race.&quot; We would
<br>
diversify.
<br>
<p>Some of us would remain on the planet.... Others would move
<br>
offworld. Some would go to live on the Sun. Others would migrate to
<br>
places nearby but invisible. Some would open holes in the fabric of
<br>
spacetime, and step through doorways where no doors were previously
<br>
known to exist.
<br>
<p>I watched the phantom futures lap over each other like waves; none
<br>
constant, none fixed, all of them melting and solidifying in a swirl
<br>
of probability and potential.
<br>
<p>Humanity's future was uncertain, but this much I knew: any action I
<br>
took would ripple out across the eons to have enormous impact.
<br>
<p>Entire posthuman civilizations millions of years hence would rise and
<br>
fall on the choices made by me, now, in the present.
<br>
<p>Evolution, I realized, is not an impersonal force. You and I are
<br>
participating in it at this very moment.
<br>
<p>You and I are the butterflies, flapping our wings, only dimly aware of
<br>
the hurricanes we're setting in motion.
<br>
<p>And not one of us is insignificant.

<p>(Otherwise a seriously cyberdelic cartoon, but inspiring nevertheless.
<br>
Several of his other cartoons have transhumanist ideas, although with
<br>
his own take on them. Be sure to check out his Apocamon - the anime
<br>
version of the Book of Revelations)
