<em>&gt; There is a fairly big difference here.  A not insignificant

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Here in Sweden we have a very tough policy on drugs, with strong popular
<br>
support. It still doesn't work. Do you really think the American war on
<br>
drugs would really work better if less people were opposed to it? 
<br>
<p>The risk right now is that a lot of decisions are taken on the basis of
<br>
the current mood - decisions which are going to haunt the US and the
<br>
world for a long time. People are right now run by their amygdalae :-(
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It is of course open to speculation whether a war on terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is more difficult than a war on drugs.
</em><br>
<p>In many ways it is, since a terrorist is free to decide when, where and
<br>
how to strike, while the drug trade involves a lot of logistics for
<br>
moving money, drugs and equipment between origin and customer. And since
<br>
anybody with a grudge is a potential terrorist and could start his own
<br>
campaign (think of the Unabomber), you need much more information to be
<br>
effective. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; No ideas are worth dying or killing for. Ideas are for living, not
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; No Anders, I'd have to disagree.  I'd be with Brian and Miriam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this one.  While I'd hope to be clever enough to find ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to live, if one can find ideas which offer ways for one's death
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have extropic value then they are worthy of consideration.
</em><br>
<p>Why are we holding ideas? Because we want to survive and live better
<br>
lives. While I agree that in a lose-lose situation it might be
<br>
preferable to make one's death pro-extropic, in situations where the
<br>
choice is between survival and some abstract good I would generally
<br>
argue that survival is the goal. Of course, you might have a long
<br>
discount factor and estimate that the consequences of temporarily not
<br>
pursuing (say) freedom will be so bad that the survival option has a
<br>
lesser value than the death option. I would respect such a conclusion,
<br>
but I think it is exceedingly rare that such situations really appear. 
<br>
<p>The problem with talking about ideas worth dying for is of course that
<br>
this is exactly the kind of thinking and value system that underlies the
<br>
terrorist mindset. And in the current situation there seems to be a lot
<br>
of people who think there are plenty of ideas *others* should die for.
