Well, it is about time.  I have long advocated modifying our symbiots
<br>
first, and then replacing them with nanotech when available (nanochondria,
<br>
see <a href="http://www.transhumanism.com/lexicon/n.html">http://www.transhumanism.com/lexicon/n.html</a>).  Why should children not
<br>
have the very best mitochondrial DNA available?  I am sure that beyond
<br>
avoiding mitochondrial disease, there are bound to be folks out there that
<br>
do not have as much general energy available to them because they have low
<br>
efficiency symbiots.  If I were going to reproduce myself today, I would
<br>
not choose my own (mother's) mitochondria to pass on, I would go for
<br>
mitochondria from Bar-Headed Geese.  These guys fly at up to 30,000 feet
<br>
to get over the Himalayas every year on migration.  Now, that, is
<br>
somekinda bio energy system!
