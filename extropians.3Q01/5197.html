<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, the immigration of all those Mexican peasants does indeed matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to us all, especially those of us who are planning to be frozen if old age
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ain't cured pretty soon.  The substantial MAJORITY of immigrants, Mexicans or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; otherwise, are &quot;peasants.&quot;  From my observations, peasants don't run much of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; a country. Mainly, they live in kleptocracies. I don't want the USA to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; kleptocracy. I doubt cryonics would be legal for the common man in the USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; were uneducated peasants to abound in the USA.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Everything hinges on the rate of cultural uptake.  My own ancestors came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from a variety of European countries most of which had no clue concerning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; traditions of liberty.  Sometimes I suspect that the decline in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; respect for those traditions may have been the fault of a number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nineteenth century immigrants who tried, but who just didn't &quot;get it&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Then when opportunities to socialize a great many things in the 20th
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; century arose, they and their descendents embraced these &quot;naturally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; appealing&quot; programs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have known too many people from other countries who deeply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appreciated freedom compared to the conditions back home.  Many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them appreciated much, much more than we who were born into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it because they really understand the difference first hand!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the counter-position may be true, the decline in appreciation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of liberty and of a liberal republic is from those born to it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forgetting what they have and not enough influx of people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand very well what a treasure it is.
</em><br>
<p>I have found that there is a distinct difference between appreciating an
<br>
effect and understanding and accepting the conditions required to
<br>
produce that effect. Freedom is an effect, one which most people
<br>
appreciate greatly, each in their own way and with their own
<br>
limitations. Far fewer people understand and accept the necessity of the
<br>
conditions required to produce freedom. Fewer still are willing to
<br>
actively do what it takes to produce freedom, to pay the price. If more
<br>
people were so willing, this world would be a far different place.
