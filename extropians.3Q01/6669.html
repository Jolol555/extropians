<p>
Now we're talking about a technology I know something about -- or used to,
<br>
anyway.  Folks who've been to my house know that the ceiling in my study is
<br>
the home of my old radio control birds.  I've been thinking about the same
<br>
kinds of things, Robert.  Obviously the range of small RPVs or AAVs is
<br>
relatively small (although a sailplane can stay aloft almost indefinitely in
<br>
the right conditions -- I used to keep my 2-meter birds in the air for hours
<br>
on good days).
<br>
<p>The range problem can be solved though, by delivering the birds as if they
<br>
were munitions: drop a brace of them in a canister from the wings of an F-15
<br>
cruising at 50,000 feet, the canister braking by parachute closer to the
<br>
ground, opening and deploying its cargo of half a dozen folded-up
<br>
reconnaissance drones.  Hell, with the right design and materials, you could
<br>
do it with an artillery shell.
<br>
<p>The problem is the trade-off between speed, maneuverability and payload on
<br>
the one hand versus duration and range once the vehicle's under its own
<br>
power.  A slow, silent electric-powered motor sailor could keep a camera
<br>
running up and down Afghan valleys for hours and hours in the hands of a
<br>
skilful pilot.  I suppose an antenna could be built into the carbon fiber of
<br>
the plane's frame to give its radio the reach to get up to an AWACS relay.
<br>
I envision a clear dome on the plane's belly in which a pointable camera
<br>
could be housed.  Mass-produced, you could build such a bird for under $5k
<br>
apiece.  At DOD prices, I guess that means $100k.
<br>
<p>As for shooting them down, well, I wouldn't want to try to do it with an AK.
<br>
I doubt the mujahadien have a lot of goose guns.
<br>
<p>But I agree with Barbara that we have to worry about the people and weapons
<br>
that the bad guys already have pre-positioned in autonomous action cells in
<br>
the West.
