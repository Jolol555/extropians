Hello,
<br>
I am not a racist, but, after seeing the probable terrorist name list on
<br>
the news, I will have to do one racist thing in the (at least near) future,
<br>
in  order to, quite and simple, save my ass, and I am posting this so that
<br>
others here may consider this too.  However, a name is easier for a person
<br>
to change than the face.
<br>
<p>When I board a plane, I will carefully look at other passengers - either at
<br>
the gate or in the plane as they come in after me.  I think the best thing
<br>
to do is to wait near the gate until the lat possible moment, then look in
<br>
the plane as they come in - if people come in after you and seat in front,
<br>
walk up to them.
<br>
<p>If I see any suspicious faces (you know what I mean by &quot;suspicious&quot; here -
<br>
people from a particular part of the world, and this is I am afraid a
<br>
racist behaviour), especially if I see more than one, I am getting the hell
<br>
out of  there while the door is still open.  I will not fly with them on one
<br>
plane - I am sorry, this is quite terrible what I wrote and no doubt I will
<br>
hear for  it.
<br>
<p>I think that a repeat of Sep 11 is unlikely - if a hijacking begins, other
<br>
passengers will probably immediately start fighting the attackers.  However,
<br>
I do not want to rely on the terrorists vision to see that and change the
<br>
modus operandi.
<br>
<p>-------------------
<br>
<p>On another note, I observe there is a discussion on this list on the merits
<br>
of privacy vs.  security.  This is a difficult dilemma.  However, I hope
<br>
that this will be left to good ol' market forces of capitalism.  That is,
<br>
some american airlines will offer, at least on some flights, enhanced
<br>
security in exchange for reduced privacy (like Israeli El Al).  That is,
<br>
hand searches of cabin, all passengers, by the person of same sex, all cabin
<br>
luggage, and all check-in luggage.  You can see that this will prevent all
<br>
hijackings and bombings (if you have hijackers attacking with bare hands,
<br>
the passengers and armed crew will easily take care of them, rather than
<br>
wait for suicide).  Then we can see whether sufficient number of customers
<br>
would subject to that in exchange for greater security, and market forces
<br>
would produce equilibrium between safety and security.  Myself, I will
<br>
gladly diminish my privacy in order to be safe.  If you don't like that, you
<br>
can go to a competitor and die with your privacy intact.  Let the market
<br>
decide, we don't have to duke this one out.
<br>
