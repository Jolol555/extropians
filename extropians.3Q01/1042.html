<em>&gt; Soon afterward, Heidi and David were watching “60 Minutes” and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saw a segment on the salvation of Molly Nash, 6, who was dying of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fanconi anemia, an inherited blood disease. Her parents, Lisa
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Jack Nash of Englewood, Colo., had set out to create a sibling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bone-marrow donor for Molly, undergoing four cycles of in-vitro
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fertilization to make a total of 30 embryos with Lisa's eggs and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jack's sperm. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Using technology largely developed by Mark Hughes, a former
</em><br>
<em>&gt; National Institutes of Health geneticist, scientists in Illinois had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tested one cell from each of the 30 embryos and found that five of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the embryos were free of the disease gene and also perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tissue-type matches for Molly. Four embryos failed to take hold in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lisa's womb, but with the fifth one, she became pregnant. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In September, Lisa gave birth to a boy, Adam. Soon after he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; born, doctors transfused some of his blood cells into Molly's veins,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where they settled permanently into her marrow to do the job her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own cells could not do. Adam's preconception and selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prompted an unhappy phone call to the transplant doctor from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vatican a few weeks later, but the doctor took it in stride. Molly was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already getting better. 
</em><br>
<p>This is a beautiful story.  I wish I had been born like that.  Adam's
<br>
creation, in addition to the standard purpose of birthing a full human
<br>
being, had the additional purpose of saving another's life.  That
<br>
secondary purpose doesn't shadow the first; it confirms and uplifts it.  I
<br>
can't think of a better start in life.  It's the opposite of being born
<br>
under a shadow; like being born under a star.
