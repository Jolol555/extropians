<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; In most cases that I've seen, those pile-on &quot;attacks&quot; have

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; merely been *many* people expressing their take.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; And you don't think these people talk to each other, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; each cheer what the others write, and egg each other on?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, they do.  So what?  You cannot suppose that your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideological allies don't do the same.  Moreover, it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really matter if they egg each other on or not.  What matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are the tone of the discussion and the logic of the arguments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
When you get sent 1200 emails in the space of three days  filled with inane comments and bald insults, they are not playing a quality game, but a quantity game - it's called 'overwhelm'.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;AND TALK ABOUT TAKING NO PRISONERS.  Look at what you wrote, Joe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Now honestly,  do you not perceive that---even in the slightest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;way---your criticism could just as easily be directed at your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;own post?   May we not lower the level of denunciation just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;little *here*---just for a while (I'm not calling for complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;elimination of denunciation, by any means).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Of course the level of denunciation was high; I was giving a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; doppelganger object lesson in what I have been repeatedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; dealt; phrases like 'pinko social collectivist hand-wringing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; bleeding heart commie LIBERAL&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes.  There has been some of that.  But I think damned little;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though here one's impression would depend heavily on whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one was the target.  By the way, thanks very much for discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this further without any more name-calling.  &quot;Getting even&quot; only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;makes things worse, and accomplishes nothing more than ensuring
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that your ideological adversaries pigeon-hole you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Their nature seems to be to pigeonhole everyone who does not agree with them in every particular as either hopelessly dense, a clueless dupe or a bright but malevolent ringer (see my posts on the structure of extremism, to which they took immediate and vociferous offence, even though they were not named in them).  Anything but a person possessing rational reasons for not becoming an acolyte at theri ideological altar.  If you were around when this was happening onlist you could not make such a (damned little) statement.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's count the emotionally loaded words in this.  (First, you *were*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; warning Eric about the libertarians on this list, I was not in error.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Please cite the post in the archives; I honestly don't remember doing so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A thousand apologies!  I cannot figure out why I thought *you*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrote it.  It was Tiberius Gracchus who wrote it.  He send it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at Sat 8/4/2001 6:46 AM:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Oh my. The extropians are not gonna like you. They are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to call you a troll and a socialist.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No wonder you couldn't remember it!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Well, I'm somewhat relieved; I considered that I might have eaten the wqrong hamburger!
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.  1 - by those trolling    2 - slander   3 - &quot;self-righteous-wing&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; (I think that Joe means right-wing).  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I mean self-righteously right-wing - the secular equivalent of the religious 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; right, and just as absolutist, messianic and condemnatory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; And then there is the statement about his adversaries being (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; projecting) logical incoherence and not being rooted in factual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; reality.  Your typos would diminish if you became less emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; in all of this; you are among friends, I assure you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It was no typo;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, it was, I was referring (and I quoted) the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Such sellf-righteous-wing people seem to have a highly developed sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of psychological projection which proves to be rootless with respect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; logical coherency or factual reality.  I have even been told by one...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;:-)  So I'm not completely crazy, there are two &quot;l&quot;s there.  Small typo, I guess.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Oh, THAT typo; I thought you meant a grammer or syntax error.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes!  Good, right!  I have seen libertarians do exactly what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; say. They'll effectively dismiss arguments and posters by sentences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; containing such terms *without* supplementing those phrases by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; rational explanation.  But then, on the other hand, some people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; write things like &quot;socioculturally ludditic conservatives&quot;, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; So, you see, it happens from all quarters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'd have to drop a Spruce Goose load of such denunciations to go to even begin 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to tilt the balance towards something remotely resembling parity around here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, I've not seen much of it lately.  Anyway, name-calling unsupported
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by argument needs to be dropped from everyone's behavior.  But again, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;isn't it objectively true that there are quite a number of posters with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;collectivist and socialist leanings?  Naturally, one should make clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at least in context what one means by such terms; here I mean by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;collectivist&quot;, state-sponsored actions on a large-scale for purposes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of redistribution of wealth or on-high enforcement of majority-decided
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moral norms of the non-traditional variety (e.g., outlawing some kinds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of personal freedoms that were, say, usual in America in 1850, e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discriminating against whomever you pleased for whatever reason you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pleased).  Same, I think, for &quot;socialist&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or do you consider those just insult words.  For example, calling anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a &quot;fascist&quot; or a &quot;racist&quot; on this list is quite wrong and is name-calling,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unless you back it up awfully well.  This is true because not a soul
</em><br>
<em>&gt;admits to such a description.  But if you do as I have done, to wit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(in reverse) by, e.g., saying that some people have made racist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statements, then it of course has to be demonstrated by quoting the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;precise source.  So do you think that &quot;socialist&quot; and &quot;collectivist&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as adjectives are often misapplied?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I believe that they are the intended moral equivalent, to those who use them, of employing racial and/or ethnic slurs, just as nazi name-calling is.
