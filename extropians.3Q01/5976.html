<em>&gt; Hahahahaha hehehehe!  We can barely get 20,000 people to attend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a protest rally on these subjects and you want to get them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lay their lives, fortunes and citizenship on the line to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually seceed from the US?  It is a fun dream but I think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is really dreamland right now.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I must bring to your attention that we can consider setting up an independent colony to get out of this mess. This does not mean escapism, but that we must recognise that a lot of people refuse to lead a liftstyle that we belive they should and could (i.e. maximising their own freedom). We can set up a colony and both groups (i.e. ourselves and the rest who choose to refuse) live life as all of us prefer.
<br>
<p>Refusal to recognize this fact would only bring disaster to all your efforts to prevent the loss of your freedoms. Violence and clashes calculated to reduce the influence of your Governments, of insufficient people, would only lead to busy emergency rooms and more business for the undertakers. It would probably lead to the loss of your individual freedom too, as in enjoying free lodging from your Governments.
<br>
<p>Attempts to mail bomb will only classify yourself as a malicious &quot;hacker&quot; intent on creating a Denial-of-Service (DOS) attack on Government servers (as what the Singapore Government had done for an unrelated case). Even if your mails get through, they would only experience censorship from the human operators who get to press the delete key constantly.
<br>
<p>Think carefully about your actions and consequences.
