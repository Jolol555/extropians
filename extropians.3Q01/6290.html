<p>Besides personal ties, I've been emotionally devastated at the thought of
<br>
what was destroyed--reading the names and occupations of the people already
<br>
known to be dead; seeing photos of the WTC as it was and as it is now.
<br>
<p>I also feel fear of what might come next, regardless of what US leaders
<br>
choose to do. The underlying causes of hostility are complex and have
<br>
already happened. Failure to secure the rights US oil companies in mineral
<br>
leases; religious fanaticism, some of which the US has subsidized; the
<br>
insatiable need of the US for oil; the US policy of setting up weak men as
<br>
dictators and then bullying them, etc.  Now the price must be paid.
<br>
<p>Here's something the architect of the WTC said about his project:  'The
<br>
World Trade Center should, ... because of its importance, become a living
<br>
representation of man's belief in humanity, his need for individual dignity,
<br>
his belief in the cooperation of men, and through this cooperation his
<br>
ability to find greatness.'

<br>
<p>I do believe that the people responsible for yesterday's death and
<br>
destruction should be harshly dealt with in order to discourage such acts in
<br>
the future. But it would be counterproductive to let a desire for revenge
<br>
cause us to lose sight of those qualities Yamasaki sought to represent when
<br>
he designed the WTC. I'm greatly disturbed by reckless talk of war, knowing
<br>
that in modern wars, the people who pay the highest price are ordinary
<br>
people who had no desire to participate in the wheeling and dealing and
<br>
quarrels of their political leaders.
<br>
<p>Before we set out to inflict more death and destruction, it would make sense
<br>
to objectively examine our past behavior to see if there's anything we might
<br>
constructively change about ourselves.
