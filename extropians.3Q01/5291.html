<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Kuhn's theory was that all scientific theories are equally and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; subjectively valid, and one only gains credence over another due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; class conflict between established scientists and the younger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; generations of scientists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Is that in &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;?  That's sure not
</em><br>
what
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I learned from that book!  Where is this part of his mindset exposed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I think Mike is more or less right on this occasion (I mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;correct&quot;; he's always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (somewhere to the) right &lt;g&gt;). Kuhn does talk somewhere about old
</em><br>
scientists
<br>
<em>&gt; having to die off (though not by violence) as part of the way new
</em><br>
paradigms
<br>
<em>&gt; achieve acceptance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russell who most definitely has read Kuhn
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
The Reader's Digest version of Kuhn:
<br>
On the negative side he criticized the two main views of scientific
<br>
objectivity prevalent at the time:
<br>
Inductivism: Kuhn said that this view presupposes a theory or paradigm level
<br>
of observation and meaning, but there is no such theory neutral level of
<br>
observation. Scientists working in different paradigm see the world
<br>
differently, much like Gestalt switches.
<br>
Deductivism: against Popper and the poppets Kuhn claimed that scientific
<br>
paradigms always work with &quot;anomalies&quot;, observations which do not fit with
<br>
existing theory. Deductivism tells us to renounce theories or paradigms in
<br>
this case. But according to Kuhn no paradigm has passed this test.
<br>
On the positive side Kuhn flirted with several views of scientific
<br>
objectivity most notably:
<br>
1. An idealistic or what some today might call a 'social constructivist'
<br>
account of objectivity where reality is constituted or made (at least in
<br>
part) by scientists themselves. This reading is supported by such remarks
<br>
that scientists working in different paradigms live in &quot;different worlds&quot;.
<br>
2. A model of science inspired by Darwinian evolution, viz., that science
<br>
should not be seen as evolving towards some final goal like &quot;the true theory
<br>
of everything&quot; but merely as evolving in response to difficulties that
<br>
paradigms all seem to eventually face. The idea, in other words, is to give
<br>
up some overarching teleology for science in the same way that biologists
<br>
have abandoned this idea for species evolution.
<br>
<p>Kuhn backed away from 1 almost immediately, including the postscript to the
<br>
second edition and in his later writings. Kuhn never developed 2 although
<br>
others have tried. Kuhn's lasting legacy may be that he raised to prominence
<br>
the question of the relation between scientific practice and the philosophy
<br>
of science.  If Kuhn is right, inductivism and deductivism are hopeless as
<br>
accounts of actual scientific practice. Most philosophers of science today
<br>
think that an adequate philosophy of science has to somehow account or model
<br>
actual scientific practice, so in a sense, Kuhn won the day. (Critics, from
<br>
the safety of their armchairs, complain that this confuses the context of
<br>
discovery with the context of justification). Mark
