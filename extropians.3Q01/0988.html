<a href="mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20SDI%20was%20Re:%20Expanding%20the%20&quot;United%20States%20of%20America&quot;&In-Reply-To=&lt;200107122202.PAA21454@mail.agorics.com&gt;">mlorrey@datamann.com</a> said:
<br>
<em>&gt; The requirements for the SDI system are, according to the estmates for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the numbers of lines of code, fully within today's capability, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every major operating sytem runs with more lines of code today. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is illuminating is that every time industry capabilities reach the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alleged amount of code SDI's detractors claim is necessary, they move
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mark. 
</em><br>
<p>Redell's argument isn't that the system is too big.  He's worked on big 
<br>
systems.  His argument is that existing big systems that work are used and 
<br>
tested in non-critical situations before they're deployed in the real 
<br>
world.  As they get more use, people are willing to rely on them more.
<br>
<p>When a large reservation system, or a new telephone switch, or the control 
<br>
system for a airframe is developed, it can be tested in simulations, and 
<br>
then with larger and larger groups of testers.  Each change in the deployed 
<br>
environment reveals more bugs, which are worked around, lived with, or 
<br>
repaired.  Each change in the environment is accompanied by warnings to the 
<br>
users to expect glitches.  SDI isn't going to be deployed to protect small 
<br>
towns from small barrages, then larger areas from larger attacks, etc.  It 
<br>
will be tested in larger and larger simulations, but in the first attack, 
<br>
it has to perform flawlessly, or it won't have made things much better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Which is why deployment is being deferred for more research with other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems. 
</em><br>
<p>I hope that's the case.  That isn't the way I remember Bush's rhetoric.
