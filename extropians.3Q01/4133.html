<em>&gt; This is a very persistent male myth. And it makes a lot of sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the male point of view and basic male hormonal wiring.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not feel that way from this side often for many of us.  Sex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't hit the same way on this side.  There is much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved.  Sex drives manifest differently and have different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ramifications.  The normal generalities apply.  Females need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know the partner is trustworthy and will stick around. Females
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have more emotional aspects to sexuality (as a generality) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so on.  So on this side, just getting laid is not the primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest.  This is not to say we don't get horny and sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply want to get laid just as much as guys do.  But until the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advent of reasonable contraception this was not so simple a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposition or one not fraught with possible repurcussions. Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the pill it entails a lot more emotional complications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally for women than men.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is more difficult from this side to have sex just for sex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sake.  Or at least I find it so.  If I can't let the person into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my heart deeply then the sex part by itself is less fun that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; masturbation and much more troublesome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Being a changeling I was surprised how much difference the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diffferent hormonal mix made and how quickly.  For a very short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while it was almost as much fun after the change as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; envision.  Then my head and heart began to change very rapidly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It has led me to an experential based belief that the hormones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activate and inhibit a slew of built-in instinctual patterns as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well as effectively rewiring the emotions differently. I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this largely accounts for the actual versus the societally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructed difference in the genders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have seen the reverse happen with female-to-male TS people I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have known.  I remember one saying that since he started
</em><br>
<em>&gt; testosterone he was so horny that he often feared he would go a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utterly mad and do something totally uncouth.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Plus, a distressingly large number of women discover that some men &quot;get their jollies&quot; or &quot;get their hooks into you&quot; in
<br>
bad ways--&quot;We've boinked, so you're my property now&quot;, &quot;I have laid more pipe than Exxon!&quot;, &quot;I got twelve bitches
<br>
pregnant. I am a BAD nigga, I got balls like Kareem&quot;, &quot;I can make you come, that makes me Jesus&quot;.
<br>
<p>I'd like to know more about what happens to FtMs in that department. If FtM were more common, would the role-reversal go
<br>
that far for some?
<br>
<p>Thanks for your perspective!
