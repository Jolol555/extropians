From: &quot;Mark Walker&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tap@cgocable.net?Subject=Re:%20new%20to%20list&In-Reply-To=&lt;049b01c12d1d$40f0a9e0$e15c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">tap@cgocable.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; I wonder what you might say about, e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. The 20-60 million Soviet citizens that Stalin had eliminated in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gulag. I know you want to resist saying that what he did was morally wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so what do you say? What Stalin did was, what? Gauche?
</em><br>
<p>How about sick and wrong and stupid and ugly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2.  Do you see any _significant_ difference between treating people as means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ends? Obviously there is no moral difference as far as your concerned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is this a distinction without a difference for you?
</em><br>
<p>Defining distinctions and differences doesn't help people very much. Producing
<br>
food to feed the hungry, curing the ill, educating and training those in need,
<br>
that's _significant_.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3.  Why do you think that you and your ilk should revise our language to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempt to expunge moral claims?
</em><br>
<p>Because mass murderers have too often used moral claims to justify their
<br>
otrocities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would have thought that you would prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to use moral language to attempt to manipulate others--to get them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquiesce to your preferences--given that so many others believe in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;myth&quot; of moral claims.  Wouldn't it be more _effective_ for you to pretend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is immoral for others to interfere with your liberty to pursue your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own version of the good, even though you are privy to the truth that moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discourse is a sham? Why not keep the moral language and use it as a mask to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hide your will to power?
</em><br>
<p>Because that would constitute pathological dishonesty, an unhealthy condition
<br>
requiring no moralism to correct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     Moi? I am a skeptic--at least I think I am. Error theorists like Mackie,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to me, presuppose way too much knowledge of Being. I am inclined to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that there may be more things in heaven and earth than our dreamed of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in our human, all too human, philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>You got that right. Philosophy is as useless as moralism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If one is a skeptic like me then it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is appropriate to reason as follows: If there are moral facts or properties,
</em><br>
<p>First start by being skeptical about &quot;moral facts or properties.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and we reason and act if there are such, then we will be better off.
</em><br>
<p>A very dubious conclusion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are no moral facts or properties, and we reason and act if there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such, then we will be better off. Why? Because to think there might be moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truths is comforting, and it will tend to make everyone behave better. (As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the old saw goes: if morals do not exist, then everything is permitted).
</em><br>
<p>A better old saw: You can do anything you can back up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Note: my argument is NOT that we would be better off to believe in morals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if we _know_ there are not). Cheers, Mark.
</em><br>
<p>That's good, because belief is for children.
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
