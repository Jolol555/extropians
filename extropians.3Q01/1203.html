</em><br>
<p>When you show me the design details for the neutron-star computronium,
<br>
then I'll believe they are feasible.  Until that time I'm sticking
<br>
with atomic engineering rather than sub-atomic engineering.  Now
<br>
there are probably neutron stars circulating in the globular
<br>
clusters but they shouldn't make up 10% of the mass.  One of the
<br>
interesting things is that there is a class of stars called &quot;blue
<br>
stragglers&quot; that appear to be the result of collisions between
<br>
white dwarfs and/or neutron stars.  I would imagine the calculations
<br>
on how to use the fewest resources to cause these collisions (which
<br>
presumably result in the production of a lot of heavy elements) at
<br>
locations relatively &quot;remote&quot; from pre-existing computronium in the
<br>
G.C. (so the radiation exposure does not require extensive rebuilding
<br>
of the nanotech) is fairly non-trivial!
<br>
<p>As a side note, I'll simply add that I think recent calculations
<br>
have shown that to get the platinium abundance observed in our
<br>
solar system, there had to have been such a collision nearby
<br>
around the time our sun was forming.
<br>
<p>If it turns out that using natural &quot;gravity&quot; is more efficient than
<br>
using useful construction material for fusion breeder reactors dedicated
<br>
to the production of useful material (carbon, cobolt, etc.) then
<br>
advanced civilizations will leave the stars to do what the stars
<br>
do best.  It may be that due to low metal abundances globular
<br>
clusters are terrible places to go early in galactic development,
<br>
but as astroengineering abilities increase (and you can skew
<br>
the rate of stellar collisions) they become very attractive
<br>
places to go in the long term.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think, if a cluster collapsed very suddenly

</em><br>
<p>It might take you billions of years of orbital rearrangement to
<br>
get this to happen precisely the way you wanted.  There are millions
<br>
of stars in many GC -- figuring out how to collapse them efficiently
<br>
(and setting it up) has to be the ultimate N-body problem.  In the
<br>
M-Brain/J-Brain era, you can see the elders watching and saying
<br>
&quot;Did you see what those children over in NGC 1349 did?  They
<br>
collapsed the cluster 17.3 billion years too early and lost
<br>
3% of the available matter!  I can't believe how careless
<br>
young people are now-a-days.&quot;

</em><br>
<p>I don't think you care.  Using IR telescopes &amp; microlensing nothing of
<br>
any consequence is going to be able to approach you un-noticed.  It
<br>
doesn't seem to be worth the trouble (at this stage of the development
<br>
of the universe) to run around trying to steal matter &amp; energy (when
<br>
there is so much of it available that is &quot;undefended&quot;).  So I don't see
<br>
any advantages to &quot;stealth&quot;.  If you are paranoid about the attack
<br>
of nearby neighbors, you just launch yourself into inter-galactic space.
<br>
I can't see any reason that anyone would want to bother with you there
<br>
until the universe is much much older (and resources much much scarcer).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From my reading, the globular clusters don't currently have detectable
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'd agree.  Low metal content early on should have worked against the
<br>
formation of planets and the radiation pressure from O &amp; B class stars
<br>
(in both their formation stage and SN stage) would have blown any
<br>
gas/dust out into interstellar space, preventing formation of planets
<br>
at later stages of evolution in the cluster.

<p>Actually, it is the population II stars that are older, making up
<br>
the core and halo of galaxies as well as the globular clusters.
<br>
<p>Also, you fall into the trap that the astronomers do of assuming
<br>
no astroengineering is occurring.  If astroengineering *is* occurring,
<br>
the stars may be low in carbon because it is being recycled into
<br>
megascale structures.  They may not be population I stars at all
<br>
but population IV stars (recycled stars consisting primarily of
<br>
the H &amp; He left over after star-lifting has allowed the removal
<br>
of useful &quot;metal&quot; elements).  There isn't any well developed
<br>
theory about how one optimally drives up the metallicity and
<br>
matching energy availability of a system.  You can't just go
<br>
slamming large stars together because you lose all the material
<br>
down the resulting black hole gravity wells.  Its a very tricky
<br>
process to direct the mergers of stars with just the right mass
<br>
to optimize the production of really heavy elements.
