<p><em>&gt; Unrestrained capitalism (think early industrial US) leads to huge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discrepancies in the distribution of wealth, which leads to social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unrest (think the early labor movement) and even upheaval (think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; French Revolution).
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that huge discrepancies in wealth are necessarily
<br>
bad; it's entirely possible that the more wealthy societies are
<br>
(in the large) the greater the exponential increase of the most
<br>
wealthy.  (I think that we would trace contrary examples, like
<br>
some in South America, to other cultural and historical factors.)
<br>
<p>I think that the labor movement occurred when it did because 
<br>
of a lack of entrepreneurs and hence a labor over-supply.  Under
<br>
such conditions, laboring men in certain industries didn't want
<br>
to compete against each other and against all the other men in
<br>
the street who wanted their jobs---this would have caused wages
<br>
to go lower.  So they banded together for collective bargaining
<br>
which is all right (unless they then try to use force to prevent
<br>
owners from firing all of them, or use politics to keep owners
<br>
from getting them to sign contracts, and use politics to keep
<br>
those contracts from being legally enforced).
<br>
<p>As painful as it would be to be at a market disadvantage (it 
<br>
happens to employers too when they just can't get enough
<br>
qualified people and have to pay extortionate wages for them),
<br>
the proper view is to regard such periods as transitory:  as
<br>
soon as the wages go very low, other entrepreneurs (including
<br>
the working men themselves) would have sprung up to take 
<br>
advantage of the &quot;obscene&quot; profits.  That's how it is supposed
<br>
to work.  Unions, unfortunately, only prolonged IMO the period 
<br>
during which working men and women didn't earn very much.
