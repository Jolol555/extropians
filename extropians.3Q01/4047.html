<p>Thank you, Damien, I will take your admonition under advisement.  However, I do
<br>
not believe these are so separate.  But, you are right, I don't want vicious
<br>
abortion bans either.
<br>
<p>There is something fundamental about the boundary conditions for when human life
<br>
starts and stops.  It plays into so many of issues we discuss on this list.
<br>
Abortion, cryonics, individual rights, rights of parents to control medical
<br>
treatment of their children, rights of hospice patients to physician assisted
<br>
suicide, etc. all have come connection to when in development someone gets or
<br>
looses some kind of personhood status.
<br>
<p>The rights of frozen embryos are now in the news.  Yes, someone will argue that
<br>
all embryos have at least as many rights as the Frozen, and then connect to the
<br>
abortion issues.  The counter argument is that embryos that are connected to
<br>
women's bodies have to take a secondary rights position to the rights of women to
<br>
control their bodies.  The new twist I have heard from the Right is that in the
<br>
case of the Frozen, the control of the women's body is out of the equation, so
<br>
the latent right to life of the embryo comes to the front.
<br>
<p>What I find curious is that the respect being sprinkled on the Frozen, has
<br>
nothing to do with what they are (clumps of cells that up until recently were
<br>
considered the same as dead biopsy samples), but entirely for their 'potential'
<br>
personhood.  This get back to my earlier post about what you can do to live sperm
<br>
and eggs that you cannot do to inanimate frozen embryos.  And yet, we have a
<br>
cultural disrespect for cryo suspension of adults, even though, extrapolation of
<br>
scientific trends clearly show that these folks have 'potential' to reassert
<br>
their already established personhood.
<br>
<p>I guess your best shot is to be sure to get pregnant just prior to cryo
<br>
suspension.
<br>
