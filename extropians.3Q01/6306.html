</em><br>
<p>I feel a bit uneasy about saying this, but I do think it needs to be
<br>
said:  I'm not in shock.  As far as the degree of separation between
<br>
myself and New York, I visited there once, I have a grand-uncle who works
<br>
across the street from the World Trade Center who was not harmed, and I
<br>
have a cousin who was due to take a field trip to Manhattan that day but
<br>
her school's bus was delayed.
<br>
<p>This, however, is not the reason I'm not in shock.  I think I recall
<br>
pretty clearly my reaction when I switched on my computer, opened Netscape
<br>
email, and saw in the helpful headlines that the World Trade Center had
<br>
ceased to exist; I saw it as a piece of future history that had just
<br>
turned real.  It was something that any number of novels or fictional
<br>
timelines might have included to add color.  So that fictional construct
<br>
turned real and thereby moved us a step into the twenty-first century,
<br>
albeit not in a nice way.  Essentially the inverted version of the
<br>
reaction I had on reading about Dolly the sheep:
<br>
<p>&quot;Whoa, we really are living in the future.&quot;
<br>
<p>My second reaction was to be glad that I wasn't reading &quot;New York,
<br>
Chicago, and Washington D.C. Destroyed By Nuclear Detonations.&quot;  We're
<br>
seeing the lite version of the &quot;domestic massive terrorist disaster&quot;
<br>
scenario here.  The only really unusual thing about the disaster is that
<br>
it happened in America.  Most of the impact, crashing global stock markets
<br>
and so on, consists of people reacting to the terrorism.  A nuclear weapon
<br>
destroying New York, on the other hand, would be a significant disaster
<br>
regardless of how people reacted to it.
<br>
<p>I think, when I heard the news, that I pretty much guessed in advance how
<br>
the rest of the day would go.  I knew that I'd hear a lot of people saying
<br>
that things would never be the same again; a lot of grandstanding from
<br>
politicians talking about hitting back; the absence of any clear target
<br>
for said revenge; proposals for useless domestic security measures whose
<br>
sole real effect is giving people the feeling that they're &quot;doing
<br>
something about it&quot;; attempts to blame the intelligence community for
<br>
failing to stop something that I for one never *expected* them to be able
<br>
to stop, no matter how competent they were... and so on.
<br>
<p>I think the only major surprise that day was when I heard a Congressman
<br>
say on CNN:  &quot;We have forgotten that the first priority of the government
<br>
is not education and it is not health care, it is the security of the
<br>
citizens&quot;.  Apparently someone was angry enough to actually say something
<br>
intelligent without thinking about the opinion polls.  I was also
<br>
surprised to learn that all flights had been grounded and that the stock
<br>
market would be shut down for two full days, then surprised again today to
<br>
learn the stock market would be shut down for three days.
<br>
<p>My reaction, on the whole, is that people are trying to forcibly make this
<br>
into one of the most significant events in world history.  I don't think
<br>
it is.  Not intrinsically.  I understand the impulse to magnify the
<br>
importance.  One doesn't want several thousand people to have died for
<br>
something that doesn't ultimately change the course of history.  But I
<br>
think we'll see similar events in the future, and I don't think those will
<br>
change the course of history either.  It's just a lot of unnecessary,
<br>
pointless deaths.
<br>
<p>If the US does do anything real, militarily, it will probably involve more
<br>
death and destruction than was caused by the destruction of the World
<br>
Trade Center, dozens or hundreds of bombs instead of two planes, dropped
<br>
on some dirt-poor country far less capable of dealing with the disasters
<br>
resulting from each and every bomb impact, and the only real end result
<br>
will be more hatred of the United States.  I don't expect that will stop
<br>
the United States from doing it anyway.
<br>
<p>This is pretty much how I expected the future to go.  If we're lucky,
<br>
we'll make it to the Singularity inside the decade and we won't see
<br>
weapons of mass destruction used on major cities during that interval. 
<br>
But if we aren't that lucky, I won't be surprised.
