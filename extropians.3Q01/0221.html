<p>&lt;&lt; Brian's preceding comments re Israel's behavior toward the 'Palestinians'
<br>
&nbsp;strike me as the sort of baiting that triggers our gun flamewars.  There
<br>
&nbsp;is some truth in what he said, but it's a misleading 5% of the total
<br>
&nbsp;story.  I won't get into detailed rebuttal though unless other people
<br>
&nbsp;want to discuss it.

<br>
My experiences indicate something different from either David's or Brian's 
<br>
viewpoint.  The enemy of my enemy IS my friend. My assessment is that many 
<br>
Palestinians and other Islamists, in particular, are quite keen on Hitler, 
<br>
and appear rather taken with his policies.  That's the way it seems in 
<br>
chatrooms, at any rate. 
<br>
<p>The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem (for his own nationalist reasons) was a trainee' 
<br>
in the Abwehr, and also helped set up the Hanjar Division (Waffen SS) in the 
<br>
Balkans, which was comprised of Muslim soldiers recruited to keep Yugoslavia 
<br>
in Axis hand. The Nazis had recruited similar domestic units for the SS all 
<br>
over conquered Europe. But the religious leader, the Grand Mufti was the 
<br>
putative leader of this group. More damning was the Grand Mufti's son was a 
<br>
diplomat to the national Socialist government, for Near Eastern affairs, and 
<br>
was given at tour of Aushwitz-Birkenau in 1943. President Arafat is one of 
<br>
the many nephews of the late Grand Mufti, who resided in newly independent 
<br>
Iraq, until the British withdrawal of forces in the Mideast.
<br>
<p>My reason to provide this data is neither to motivate nor to moderate, but to 
<br>
help get a perspective on how passions run so deep and have they have a long 
<br>
history, and did not start with CNN or Newsweek's misdescription of the world 
<br>
(&lt;-insert pointed comment here) ;-D  
<br>
<p>I agree with Mr. Lubkin's notion that such a discussion may just bog the list 
<br>
down, while threads that are more, optimistic, can get sidetracked.  For 
<br>
myself, watching certain news reports coverage (CNN in particular) has moved 
<br>
me considerably farther right then I would have believed several years ago, 
<br>
even given my pragmatism.
<br>
<p>Hopefully we can set asside our differences long enough to focus on trends 
<br>
relating to future technologies.
