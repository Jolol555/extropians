&quot;What happens is a country comes to the IMF for a loan.  The 
<br>
IMF says ok, but the conditions are that you have to lower
<br>
any barriers to imports (because free trade is a good thing).
<br>
The country says ok.  So what happens is in comes a flood
<br>
of foreign goods, esp. U.S. food, produced by corporate
<br>
agri-business.  These come in at prices lower than foods
<br>
can be produced domestically and as a result the Jamaican
<br>
farmers are driven out of business.  At first I found myself
<br>
thinking -- &quot;So what? The consumers are getting the benefits
<br>
of lower food prices.&quot; -- but then I realized the problem --
<br>
the U.S. exports are being produced with very large government
<br>
subsidies.&quot;
<br>
<p>Which is why most free market supporters are against government
<br>
subsidization of business, it is usually referred to as corporate welfare
<br>
and disguised under the need to protect domestic interests.  However, the
<br>
requirement to protect domestic interest comes directly from the tribalistic
<br>
attidude that these isolationist policies perpetuate.  Its a catch 22.  
<br>
<p>&quot;If that wasn't bad enough, the IMF loans to Jamaica are at
<br>
outrageous rates (19% was quoted) and there are clauses
<br>
in the contracts that Jamaica cannot loan the money out
<br>
at a lower rate to its farmers (so they could in theory
<br>
modernize their farms with machinery to compete effectively
<br>
against American imports).  So the system is setup to *keep*
<br>
a 3rd world country in that position.&quot;
<br>
<p>This particular system might be, but a true free market economy would
<br>
benefit all involved.  Most free market supporters think that the government
<br>
should keep its nose out of business all - together, is the IMF funded by
<br>
the U.S. government?  I'm sure it must be, and if so these policies would
<br>
have been set in place by the big business using the law to ensure thier
<br>
monopolies.  Just like the phone companies trying to make it illegal to make
<br>
phone calls over the internet or the cable companies successfully making it
<br>
illegal to broadcast local channels over satelite.  The law should be used
<br>
to protect the rights of the individual, not to ensure corporate interest.
