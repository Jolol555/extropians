<p><em>&gt;&gt; I know this may seem like nitpicking definitions, but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; important that words keep their meanings else more confusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; erupts. If you're going to use the word &quot;racist&quot;, please have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the common courtesy to know what it means, and how it differs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from [bigotry and discrimination].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, please.  This claim is so pathetic.  I can't believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anybody really needs to respond to such a demand for evidence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But for the sake of completeness, here I go.
</em><br>
<p>Hey, thanks Harvey!  But I'm sure that if you reflect a while,
<br>
you'll come to believe that it really would be good to examine
<br>
the evidence, especially if we can do so in an objective fashion.
<br>
The claim is not pathetic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The article clearly claims that there are inherent differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between &quot;all&quot; blacks and &quot;all&quot; whites.  It does not even qualify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these differences as statistically likely or commonly found.
</em><br>
<p>Now I notice, for the first time that I can recall, statements
<br>
such as these being made without any quoting of the original
<br>
sources.  This is very peculiar.  I think the explanation is
<br>
that the original source (Fred Reed's essay) is heavy on 
<br>
innuendo and implication, and doesn't so easily yield up
<br>
quotable examples.  But this just makes discussing it only
<br>
more difficult, not impossible.  If we are to find the truth,
<br>
then such effort must be undertaken.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It clearly paints all whites with one description while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; painting all blacks with a difference description.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description of the whites is always superior than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description of the blacks.
</em><br>
<p>I think that you may be right; I just commented in another
<br>
post about Fred Reed's exaggerations.  Those who defend the
<br>
essay, like J.R. Molloy, are defending, it seems to me, its
<br>
open assertion of extremely impolitic truths about statistical
<br>
differences between the racial groups in America.  I certainly
<br>
will not stand behind exaggerations and inflated claims, but
<br>
by the same token I will not flinch from speaking what seems
<br>
to me to be the unvarnished truth about these matters.  And
<br>
J.R., do you or do you not believe that the article contained
<br>
exaggerated statements?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not only does it argue that whites are better, but it claims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that blacks are incapable of duplicating the achievements of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whites.  I don't know how the article could be even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racist if it tried.
</em><br>
<p>You surely can't be serious about statements like this, Harvey.
<br>
Zero Powers, before he got carried away and blurted out
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With that, please accept my exit from this thread.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It no longer has anything of value to offer.
</em><br>
<p>(which turned out not to be true---but I know how he felt
<br>
and do sympathize)... Anyway, he had pointed out
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well I grant you the post didn't contain anything on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order of: &quot;All niggers are shiftless, lazy, criminals who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have made no worthwhile contribution to society&quot; or &quot;The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only good nigger is a dead nigger.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>So you are exaggerating too, Harvey.  Frankly, this is amazing.
<br>
I've never seen a thread before where it appeared that I was the
<br>
only person actually trying to unemotionally evalute the issue.
<br>
I honestly would have predicted better from extropians.
<br>
But I digress.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Examples:  The article clearly blames welfare, crime, large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police departments, violence and fear on blacks only.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims that countries without blacks do not have these problems.
</em><br>
<p>Right.  (Although it sure would help if you had condescended
<br>
to quoting a paragraph or to of these &quot;clear&quot; statements.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It clearly states that the author could determine the race of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bad teacher by the bad skills, obviously because only blacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would show such poor skills while whites would not.
</em><br>
<p>Wrong.  Here is the relevant quote from the Fred Reed piece itself
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A few years back, my middle-school daughter brought home a horrendously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misspelled science hand-out...An understanding of chemistry clearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had never rippled the serene surface of the woman's mind.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Without thinking, I asked, &quot;What color is your teacher?&quot; (If I had thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carefully, I would have asked, &quot;What color is your teacher?&quot;) My daughter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responded with an anguished, &quot;Da-d-d-d-y!&quot; She had made the connection, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knew she wasn't supposed to.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I've got no problem with black teachers, if they are competent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No problem at all.
</em><br>
<p>Fred Reed is implying that this was a *guess*, a hunch on his part,
<br>
that the teacher was black.  (I will give him the credit for supposing,
<br>
as one should, that some white teachers, somewhere, are totally
<br>
incompetant.)  Now, I don't see anything especially unbelievable about
<br>
this anecdote.  So supposing that it's true, he made a guess, and was
<br>
right.  His whole demeanor here is implying that there is a big problem
<br>
with the education level of too many black teachers---and given the
<br>
wholesale endorsement of affirmative action, this is easy to believe.
<br>
<p>Mike made several other good points (and one more error, I think), but
<br>
this post is already too long.
