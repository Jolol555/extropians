&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what the current leanings of this thread have to do
with the<br>
&gt;&gt; Subject line.  Would you kindly let us know, of if it is
off-subject,<br>
&gt;&gt; please start a new thread.<br>
<br>
&gt;What one sentence summary would you give for Extropian Principles?
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure I can put it into one sentence, although I have thought of
the principles as being - the framework for intellection on the human
condition and a guide for living as a transhumanist. -<br>
<br>
&gt;How<br>
&gt;about, &quot;The betterment of humanity through high
technology&quot;? <br>
<br>
I don't think.&nbsp; High technology is too broad a concept and not all
high technology is or will be used to improve the human condition.&nbsp;
On a sense-level, it's rather cold.<br>
<br>
&gt;If that is<br>
&gt;close, I am asking that one look at the hazards of the the
modern<br>
&gt;lifestyle in the broad sense and see where technology can better
the<br>
&gt;living conditions of people. The incentive should be RATIONALLY
based<br>
&gt;according to the principles I read. And rationality would look at the
cost<br>
&gt;of not acting in terms of casualties/fatalities would it not?<br>
&gt;POC<br>
<br>
I'll just quote from the Web site what is says, and perhaps someone can
put it into one sentence:<br>
<br>
&quot;Extropianism is a <b><i>transhumanist</b></i> philosophy. The
Extropian Principles define a specific version or &quot;brand&quot; of
transhumanist thinking. Like humanists, transhumanists favor reason,
progress, and values centered on our well being rather than on an
external religious authority. Transhumanists take humanism further by
challenging human limits by means of science and technology combined with
critical and creative thinking. We challenge the inevitability of aging
and death, and we seek continuing enhancements to our intellectual
abilities, our physical capacities, and our emotional development. We see
humanity as a transitory stage in the evolutionary development of
intelligence. We advocate using science to accelerate our move from human
to a transhuman or posthuman condition. As physicist Freeman Dyson has
said: 'Humanity looks to me like a magnificent beginning but not the
final word.'&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;These Principles are not presented as absolute truths or universal
values. The Principles codify and express those attitudes and approaches
affirmed by those who describe themselves as 'Extropian'. Extropian
thinking offers a basic framework for thinking about the human condition.
This document deliberately does not specify particular beliefs,
technologies, or conclusions. These Principles merely define an evolving
framework for approaching life in a rational, effective manner
unencumbered by dogmas that cannot survive scientific or philosophical
criticism. Like humanists we affirm an empowering, rational view of life,
yet seek to avoid dogmatic beliefs of any kind. The Extropian philosophy
embodies an inspiring and uplifting view of life while remaining open to
revision according to science, reason, and the boundless search for
improvement.&quot;&nbsp; Max More<br>
