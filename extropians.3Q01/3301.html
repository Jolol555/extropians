<em>&gt; &gt;It is a never-ending source of amazement that bright people can make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;simplest and grossest mistakes--and that, no matter what you say or how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;clearly you say it, someone will misunderstand it.

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   I used to be a member of Mensa, an organisation where even the village
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idiot has to have an IQ in the top 2% to join. People on welfare showed up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at meetings. People who were apparently mentally ill showed up. One even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boasted about how crazy &quot;it&quot; was. In short lots of people showed up who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could not add two plus two and reliably get an answer of four. I am no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer a member of Mensa.
</em><br>
<p><p>I went to several meeting but declined to joint for somewhat
<br>
different reasons.  Here were all these big brains and they
<br>
chose to spend their time on mostly silly games, meaningless
<br>
hobbies and looking for someone smart enough to date them
<br>
despite their (often) utter lack of social skills or too-deep
<br>
self-centeredness.  There were some really great people there. 
<br>
Don't get me wrong.  But that didn't make the general atmosphere
<br>
worth it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   This experience forced me to make a clear distinction between IQ and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common sense. If the entire population suddenly acquired ten extra IQ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points, nothing much would change. If the entire population suddenly was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gifted with 10 extra common sense points, our society would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transformed overnight.
</em><br>
<p>Everyone going to around 140+ in IQ overnight would also
<br>
transform the society pretty rapidly.  What is &quot;common sense&quot;? 
<br>
It is certainly, as many have observed, not &quot;common&quot;. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   Bums in the street would vanish, because begging is a harder way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquire funds, than working a job. Crime would plummet, because in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long run crime usually really doesn't pay. Strife at the office, at home,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and at school would be reduced because it is pointless. The economy would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boom, everybody would be happy, there would be no more wars, etc, etc.
</em><br>
<p>This looks naive.  Who says there are sufficient jobs for
<br>
everyone to have one that pays a livable age even if everyone
<br>
does have &quot;common sense&quot;?  Who says that &quot;common sense&quot; would
<br>
abolish plain greed and the type of self-interest that runs
<br>
roughshod over others?  Who says it is enough to remove scarcity
<br>
thinking?  People will always be in strife as long as they
<br>
believe there fundamentally is not and never will be enough to
<br>
go around.  
<br>
<p>Real happiness is even less common than common sense.  Removing
<br>
the roots of war requires more than instilling common sense. 
<br>
Even if we had a good fix on what common sense is and the means
<br>
to instill it.
