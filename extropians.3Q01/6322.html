</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the incentive people have to commit it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The way to get rid of terrorism against us is to make the
<br>
repurcussions of attacking us so very, very undesirable that no
<br>
remotely sane group would attempt such a thing and no remotely
<br>
sane government would harbor or aid those who attempt such a
<br>
thing.  The time for appeasing other people and playing politics
<br>
and respecting other country's right to hate us and actively
<br>
seek our destruction is past.  We have seen what it has bought
<br>
us.  
<br>
<p>There is no way a free, individual rights afffirming, secular
<br>
government could help but piss off those countries and inviduals
<br>
of very different mindset.  Our very existence pisses them off. 
<br>
There is no way to appease such.  We can only make clear that
<br>
when they attack us we will respond as to an act of war.  
<br>
<p>If we removed the military presence then Iraq would run much of
<br>
the Gulf and the forces that oppose liberty or even relative
<br>
liberty would be further squashed in the area.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; There is another reason for such attacks on the US, and that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antiamericanism. It might appear absurd to many on this list, but there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are plenty of people who are deeply suspicious and prejudiced against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US worldwide - including highly educated intellectuals. Just think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about how attacks on McDonald's in Europe has been framed not as attacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a local franchise, but attempts to stop American cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperialism. Part of this is remaining cold war rhethoric that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spread far beyond the left, a bit like sticky tar that sticks to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever is touching it and hence spreads everywhere. Part of it is of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course envy. Another part is the western sympathy for David versus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Goliath - the underdog is always the hero, the giant is never the hero:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since the US is a giant, it can't be good. All these things combine to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make prejudices against americans acceptable like no other prejudices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and biases the media - which reinforces the antiamericanism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In many ways the fact that the US has become very rich and powerful by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being a beacon of freedom is the reason so many feel it acceptable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack it. That US foreign policy also gives them ample reason is simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the igniting spark that ignites the fuel that is already there.
</em><br>
<p>In short we are largely hate for our good before we are hated
<br>
for any actual evil we have, may have or will commit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While an isolationist policy might earn the US a few brownie points in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many eyes, it wouldn't be enough. Especially if you factor in people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have long memories and still want a revenge for what happened to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forefathers.
</em><br>
<p>It stops here.  The line has been crossed.  It is not time to be
<br>
isolationist and it hasn't been time every since relative
<br>
isolationism resulted in Hitler nearly becoming unstoppable. 
<br>
Isolationism in the modern world simply buys us larger and more
<br>
organized enemies including enemies of those who were our friend
<br>
and allies when their sworn enemies and our pound them into the
<br>
ground.
