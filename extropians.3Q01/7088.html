<p>Suppose somebody told you that the western world needs to tame its religion, the
<br>
sooner the better. You would probably consider that person not very knowledgeable
<br>
about the west, not even if that person built up his case by quoting the bible,
<br>
listing a long line of abortion clinic bombings, IRA attacks, Jerry Falwell's
<br>
speeches and various nasty goings on in Latin America and Africa. Because you would
<br>
know that person was just looking at specific instances of Christianity gone bad,
<br>
and that most of the west - even if it has not fully accepted it - is influenced by
<br>
the enlightenment. When that person continued to claim that the reason many
<br>
Christian third world countries was doing badly was due to their Christianity, you
<br>
would likely point out the numerous other factors holding them back - sure,
<br>
Christianity may have an effect on the Phillipines, but there are many far stronger
<br>
non-religions economical, political and historical reasons why that nation has
<br>
problems.
<br>
<p>I hope you see the analogy here: you are basing your thinking on the same kind of
<br>
assumptions about the Islamic world. A lot of it is fairly secular, and assuming it
<br>
is in need of &quot;taming&quot; is just overdoing it. There are sects and regions where
<br>
there may be a real need for the enlightenment (just imagine that it could do in
<br>
Saudi Arabia!), but you need to concentrate on them rather on Islam in general.
<br>
There is a huge difference between the Tunisian sunni and the arabian wahabits.
