</em><br>
<em>&gt; down to &quot;I believe reality should be this way, facts be damned&quot;.  Only
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; covered by cloth, one open) to demonstrate that decaying meat does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself produce maggots - have proven sufficient to dislodge said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking, and then only among those who do not insist that such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disproofs must be some kind of unspecified trickery (whether or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they can figure out how such trickery could be accomplished) since it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes against their beliefs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>All of that doesn't have a lot to do with religion.  It has more
<br>
to do with the persistent habit of human beings to think they
<br>
can just figure it out in their heads or to trust their
<br>
intuitions and random correlations too much.  Religion doesn't
<br>
have a monopoly here.  The actual going and devising an
<br>
experiment to test a supposition is a fairly recent innovation.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Therefore, in practice (at least such as I have personally observed),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religions can be safely categorized with, and dismissed along with,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking along the lines of that which, for example, claims the moon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; landing was a hoax, or that the earth is flat, or that all living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organisms must eventually die (see certain bacteria that have lived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions of years, or certain lines of human cancer cells that so far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appear to show no signs of aging over multiple decades).
</em><br>
<p>Such dismissal is never ever safe because it over-generalizes. 
<br>
It is guilty of the same sort of sloppy thinking you just
<br>
castigated some religious people's thinking for.  Life is seldom
<br>
so simple and religion is no exception.
