Apologies for the cute twists and turns in this post, but not for the content :)...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Well, monkey business it clearly is (I think this goes in the Creative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Tautology bag), and it is funny, in the classic pathetic humor style.  Yes, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;will all sort itself out with time, and most of the folks that are getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;up&quot; about this have no clue about the truly promethean impact of the things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;we see coming in the next 20 years.  Galileo knew the solar system would keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;turning even if he recanted, and that there was no way to stop people from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;knowing about it, eventually.  There is no way to stop people from finding out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that cells are machines, and although complex, are just patterns of atoms that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;have self propagation 'potential'.  However, for this to be generally
</em><br>
<p>** Mike's Good Offlist Buddy, Dr. Von Namewithheld from Pine Barren, New Jersey, writes:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well said. Hopefully the realization that 'cells are machines' will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dawn on humanity without major conflicts. See, I'm afraid of war.
</em><br>
<p>I'm, as you know, resigned that _some_ warring will take place. 
<br>
<p>Might be &quot;'Good'-[in the form of strange coalitions]-vs-'Good&amp;EvilAtTheSameTime'&quot;, as I have called it. 
<br>
G-vs-GEST for short. IOW: Those who (think they) know what's best for everybody versus those who don't.
<br>
The creepy part is I still don't know which side I'll be on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A question: would a cloned human be the modern day equivalent of a bastard?
</em><br>
<p>Or the modern-day Nigger, Kike or other sub (/non) human. Our own very special--&quot;don't care what color you are, don't
<br>
let the sun set on your ass in _our_ town, 'Dolly'!&quot;--contribution to &quot;genetic purity&quot; in the romantic-naturalist (is
<br>
there a better word?) regime.
<br>
<p>I think 'Dollies' is a good placeholder for whatever new pejorative shows up for genespliced sub/nonhumans.
<br>
<p>* Special to Offlist Buddy: You did read the Siamese twin + chimera posts from Broderick and others, didn't you?
<br>
<p>&quot;Don't talk of guns and roses, or should we powder our noses; don't dwell on last year's capers; give me steel give me
<br>
steel, give me pulses unreal. He'll save yer saviour sure! Hear me, I'm graphically yours. Someone to claim us, someone
<br>
to follow, someone to shame us, some brave Apollo! Someone to fool (us) Somebody like you, We _want_ you, Big Brother.
<br>
Big Brother...&quot; [lyrics by David Bowie, emphasis and any mondegreens by your ob't sv't]
<br>
<p>Phew.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would the cloned have rights, or would they be suspended? (same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fingerprint and much else from the DNA donor---creates problemos).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another concern I have is that the next generation or so of humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might have a lot of resentment towards us older folks. Seems to me a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of the technology in question is transhuman in some respects,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and---clones or no clones---the upcoming generation might resent us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for making them our big experiment. 
</em><br>
<p>BINGO. Have I sent you a pointer to my thread on Nanodot regarding Kids-as-chattel and the possibility that manipulation
<br>
of kids/unborns is inherently unethical past, fixing _deeply_ wrong things. How do you get informed consent for
<br>
adaptations to permit &quot;mutants&quot;, so to speak, to walk the Earth?
<br>
<p>I have expressed other concerns as well, there, as you can read.
<br>
<p>If I haven't sent you the URL for that, TELL ME. I can't access the site at the moment or I'd include a link here.
<br>
To hook in to salient parts of the thread, try to search www.nanodot.org for (a) post(s) from me (account name &quot;butler&quot;)
<br>
containing the phrases &quot;children as chattel&quot; or &quot;I expect to be pilloried&quot;.
<br>
<p>There are opportunities for &quot;sickness wit' a quickness&quot; here, like having sex with Marilyn Monroe's corpse... Hey, _I
<br>
didn't kill her, she was that way after the bus hit her, you dig, but what a waste to not go for all the gusto you CAN,
<br>
right? I feel a George Carlin urge coming on.
<br>
<p>I have another buddy who says the subtext of SpielbergKubrick's _A.I._ includes &quot;sex with kid robots&quot; as a gimme.
<br>
<p>OMGIJT: &quot;Who will love you no matter what....&quot;
<br>
<p>And--Oh my god, I just thought--&quot;Is this a game?&quot; Wow.
<br>
<p>Woah. He's right. It's a REAL SHORT STROLL down a Teflon slope. For some people. Who are single ply thinkers. &quot;I have a
<br>
right to own property.&quot; &quot;I have needs, and I'M NOT HURTING ANYONE.&quot; &quot;Don't Tread On Me.&quot; &quot;I never signed no fucking
<br>
Social Contract.&quot;
<br>
<p>Gah. Methinks I'm turning into an old biddy. I _am_ glad I missed that. Maybe I should go attend Promise Keepers.
<br>
<p>* Special to Offlist Buddy: &quot;Children of the Atom&quot;--ever hear of/read that one? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As we crank out genetically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modified kids, how will we regard them? Will we poke and prod them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like Dolly, learn and recast them in successive experiments? Will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they already feel less-than-human merely by our treatment of them?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;This is for your own good.&quot; + 
<br>
&quot;We'll always know _you_... You'll have the 'Mark 'o Cain' fix JUST LIKE ALL YOUR SNOT-NOSED PEERS, AND YOU'LL LIKE IT,
<br>
goddamn it, now clean your plate, young man.&quot; + 
<br>
&quot;We sacrifice EVERYTHING to get you an appointment to West Point and THIS is the thanks we get?&quot;
<br>
<p>Un-Fuck. And the beat goes on. This has major mythological clout. Phew.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Big questions for a Monday afternoon at the office.
</em><br>
<p>Umm yeahr. Big questions for a lazy hazy brain like mine, anytime.
