<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; b) perhaps we don't consider skepticism inherently and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; unquestionably true or good for all purposes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Would you elaborate?  Now I'll admit that there are many ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; day-to-day situations in life where *speaking* skeptically isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the point, e.g., your boss tells a funny but highly improbable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; story, your brother tells your sister that the meatloaf was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; superb, or you visit a friend's church just out of curiosity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Skepticism as a philosophical position holds that doubting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything is good and further that there is no reason to really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe much of anything.  Most &quot;skeptics&quot; don't go that far.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't believe science and critical inquiry that affirms only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific methodology has a good handle on the many things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply are not addressed by science like values and ethics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; esthetics,  qualia and so on. 
</em><br>
<p>Quite so, but then of values, or ethics, or esthetics, one can
<br>
not search for what is true and what is false.  That's the
<br>
job of (generalized) science, e.g., history, philosophy,
<br>
biology, and so forth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Now (thinking out loud here) is your case parallel?  Perhaps it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is.  Right now I can't think of why it's not.  Can anyone?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not sure as I'm not sure of the parallel you are drawing.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hold spirituality both because I find it very beneficial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally and believe it is can or will be beneficial more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; globally and because I personally experience much of what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within it as deeply true.
</em><br>
<p>Are those things that you find in it falsifiable?  Can you
<br>
give examples that you find as deeply true that aren't just
<br>
aesthetic preferences?   Are those things necessarily true
<br>
of all humans, or of aliens, or of sentient creatures in
<br>
general?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; That's maybe what is not parallel in our cases.  Do you actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; separate yourself from all those &quot;luddites&quot; as you called them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by also ALWAYS disparaging their beliefs while putting forth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your own about &quot;spirituality&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't find &quot;disparaging&quot; their beliefs very fruitful often. 
</em><br>
<p>...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Now sometimes it is necessary to say that what some of them is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing is evil and wrong-headed and to make no bones about that. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But for it to be effective you must also understand their world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bit and say it in a way that penetrates that world.  
</em><br>
<p>In some discussions with them I have gone so far as to
<br>
say that their beliefs about miracles and so on are false.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; ...So no, I don't go out of my way to disparage others.
</em><br>
<p>In an effort to prevent further miscommunication, I want it
<br>
clear that I was never asking you about disparaging others,
<br>
only about their beliefs.
<br>
