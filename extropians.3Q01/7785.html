<p>The reason is so that the U.S. will control the oil fields. It's not
<br>
about terrorism, it's about oil. It's always about oil. Who cares if we
<br>
destablize S.A., or cause resentment among the world islamic population
<br>
just for being there. Sure, some americans may die in terror attacks but
<br>
this is as nothing compared to profits for the oil companies. The U.S.
<br>
military will sweep the Saudi military aside quickly enough should it
<br>
come to war.
<br>
<p>The struggle against terrorism will take years because it will take that
<br>
long to establish large secure bases surrounding the oil-rich areas of
<br>
the middle east. This is american power projection at it's finest, and
<br>
now using the 9/11 events as an excuse, we can pretty much blackmail
<br>
many of the countries in the region into accepting an american military
<br>
presence.
<br>
<p>And with the destablizing effects this will have thruout the region,
<br>
why, it's a good thing we're there in force, ready to protect legitimate
<br>
governments from the anger of their own people, isn't it?
<br>
<p>World domination, american style. What do you think?

<br>
<p><p>Of course it is about oil, but it is also about support for America's
<br>
unofficial ally, Israel. The American State Department career officers have
<br>
been saying since 1948 that our national interest is twofold: 1) free flow
<br>
of oil at market prices, and 2) geopolitical influence that is as broad as
<br>
possible. In the cold logic of nations, this analysis is flawless. However,
<br>
in the feelings of many people in America and elsewhere, the only morally
<br>
correct action after the Nazi holocaust against the Jews was and is to
<br>
support Israel against the Arabs who have always opposed Israel's existence.
<br>
<p>As a practical matter in American politics, this is also a necessity due to
<br>
the way political campaigns are funded, and the way that many journalists
<br>
write about the candidates and their policy positions.
<br>
<p>If the pragmatists at State had had their way, the USA would have sided with
<br>
the Arabs in 1948 and since, which would have virtually guaranteed our
<br>
access to oil and the friendship of the world's nearly one billion Muslims.
<br>
But that's not the policy we pursued. Therefore, we are in the precarious
<br>
position of still needing that oil but of not having the support of most of
<br>
the Arabs who own it, nor of their fellow Muslims from Indonesia to Tunisia.
<br>
<p>And if you think Americans are in a tough position, just consider the
<br>
position Israelis are in. They need oil too. But even more, they need peace,
<br>
in pursuit of which they have made enormous concessions to the Palestinians.
<br>
What have they got in exchange? Ever increasing demands, and no peace;
<br>
suicide bombers instead of peaceful borders.
<br>
<p>There is no simple solution to the problems of the Middle East or of the
<br>
current dependence of industrial society on petroleum. Casting the situation
<br>
as one of naked US imperialism is certainly too simplistic for this complex,
<br>
morally ambiguous situation.
