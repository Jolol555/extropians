<p><p>Yes, it's unlikely.  But you are assuming the operatives knew 
<br>
what the backers were about.  This may be true.  It probably is. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But do remember that both the government and the press lie 
<br>
constantly.  Most likely they are only fine-tuning their 
<br>
presentation this time.  That seems to be the way to bet.  But 
<br>
duplicity on this scale is far from unprecedented.  Consider FDR 
<br>
and the Japanese telegram, and with that in mind say again &quot;This 
<br>
may be another Pearl Harbor&quot;.  Tastes a bit different, no?
<br>
<p>I'm willing to accept that there are several &quot;bad guys&quot; 
<br>
involved.  I'm just not sure that they are all on the same side.
<br>
<p>Still, this kind of thing needs to be discouraged. 
<br>
Emphatically.  The questions that need answering are who and 
<br>
how.  I have doubts about simplistic answers.  But we may end up 
<br>
needing to go with a &quot;best guess&quot;.  Fortunately the prime 
<br>
suspects are all folk that have already declared us their 
<br>
enemies, so it's hard to go too wrong.  Except by thinking that 
<br>
they are the only ones responsible.
