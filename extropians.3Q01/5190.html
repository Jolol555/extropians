<p>This is really rather fatuous posturing. &quot;There is no reality&quot;? I don't
<br>
see gravity, for example, as being inforced by intellectual, social,
<br>
moral, or scientific authority. It just IS, its inherent in the
<br>
substrate of reality that cannot be denied by any amount of subjectivist
<br>
hand waving and denial. Similarly, the other subatomic forces and
<br>
physical constants of the universe ARE, they exist irrespective of your
<br>
desire to not believe in them. Since they define how matter is formed
<br>
and interacts, they define all chemical processes as immutable reality,
<br>
which includes biological processes like photosynthesis, reproduction,
<br>
and evolution, as well as neural processes of highly complex biological
<br>
constructs like the human mind.
<br>
<p>I don't deny that subjectivists have tried for thousands of years to
<br>
deny that reality is real. Its a natural desire because life is hard and
<br>
denial is easy. From the yogic frauds of india to the charismatic con
<br>
artists of the western religions of judaism, christianity, islam, and
<br>
socialism, denial of reality sells far better than the alternative.
