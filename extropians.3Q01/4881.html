I do not differentiate between classes or disciplines of knowledge, as
<br>
in science compared to morality for instance. There are simply different
<br>
contexts in which we devote similar forms of thought. Each contains
<br>
protocols, authority, and experience. Each is a social endeavor.
<br>
<p>I do not agree with people who say morality does not exist because there
<br>
are no facts to support it. What is a fact? Isn't a fact just what you,
<br>
me, or someone has chosen to be significant? Saying there are no facts
<br>
to support morality implies there are facts to support something else.
<br>
Is anything really supported by facts? No. Not to me. Things are
<br>
supported only by an argument someone makes, or the will of that person
<br>
to make an argument.
<br>
<p>About relativists being prone to facilitate an over abundance of
<br>
morality, I call myself a civil libertarian more than a relativist. I
<br>
challenge reality because I do not like being told what to do or how to
<br>
think. When you tell me what reality is, or is supposed to be, you are
<br>
attempting to dictate to me what things to find significant and
<br>
disregard.

<em>&gt;What are we talking about here? Cultural relativism is often understood as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;general thesis about the relativity of culture in its entirety, e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;science, morals, art, religion, etc. Perhaps this is what Russell is talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about. David seems to be speaking about moral relativism, which is a proper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subset of cultural relativism, e.g., one might be a relativist about moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;truths but a nonrelativist about scientific truths or vice-versa.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I agree morality exists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think you need to explain this a bit more. Relativists do not generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deny that morality exists--indeed, if anything the complaint against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relativists is that they allow for a superabundance of morality. There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinkers that deny that morality exists. The Aussi philosopher J L Mackie
</em><br>
<em>&gt;famously argued that all moral truths are false because there are no moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;facts, i.e., morality does not exist. Mackie and other error theorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Nietzsche is sometimes interpreted this way) do not say that moral truths
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are relative to some social group, rather all such claims are false.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I just do not agree it is always the same, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; must always be the same.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am not sure I see the point here. Clearly nonrelativists can allow that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;morality is not always the same or must always be the same. Variability
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might be a necessary condition for moral relativism but it is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sufficient condition. Mark.
