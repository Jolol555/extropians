<p>You quote Hubble's doubts about his own discoveries. but that has
<br>
little to do with the question.  Yes, he may have made the initial
<br>
discovery, but his own interpretation of its meaning must surely be
<br>
simply considered together with all the other physicists weighing in
<br>
on the problem. He wrote these things 50 years ago. Barring some
<br>
special, &quot;secret&quot; knowledge, his interpretations hardly seem
<br>
relevant....
<br>
<p>I agree that the Big Bang is overrated, and is basically taken for
<br>
granted by most, and of course there are serious questions about its
<br>
validity.  I sure hope the universe is eternal.  As a wannabe
<br>
immortal, that would seem to be a good thing for me.  
<br>
<p>It seems to me that we really understand little about the universe and
<br>
its fate.  So therefore we as immortal wannabes should simply assume
<br>
that the universe is eternal, and work from there.  Since we don't
<br>
really understand it yet, there exists the possibility that the
<br>
universe may yet be eternal, and so we as aspiring immortals should
<br>
assume that it will indeed be eternal.  By doing so, we enhance our
<br>
own motivation. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Also, one of the main arguments by deathists against immortalism is
<br>
that since the universe will end someday, we all have to die
<br>
eventually. So there are meme considerations here....
