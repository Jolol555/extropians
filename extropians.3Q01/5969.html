<p>As interesting and necessary as technical self-defense is, I
<br>
believe the main battle must be fought in the realm of politics,
<br>
ideas and cultural values.  Some of us have never been part of
<br>
large scale political action and protests.  Some of us are old
<br>
enough to have grown up in the Vietnam era and we learned a bit
<br>
about these things. We who are of the aging baby boomer
<br>
generation need to learn to protest and to demonstrate all over
<br>
again side by side with our younger counterparts. We need to
<br>
learn how to do it smarter than we did back then and smarter
<br>
than a lot of the protests of today.  But we need just as much
<br>
dedication and passion  and just as much of a counter culture
<br>
identity as in the sixties and seventies.  And all of us,
<br>
regardless of our ages, need to make our voices heard, heard now
<br>
and heard LOUD. We need to become revolutionaries and to teach
<br>
the world what this revolution is about, what we all stand to
<br>
gain or lose, and how to fight for it.  We need first to
<br>
recognize it and dedicate to it ourselves.  Or are we going to
<br>
simply whine and dream up some gee-whiz garage &quot;technological
<br>
solution&quot;?
<br>
<p>It is easier to stop the State from going totalitarian in
<br>
disasterous ways while you still have enough rights to organize
<br>
and protest than it is to survive and manage to sneak by it once
<br>
it has done so.  You may think you are smart enough to escape or
<br>
to to work around it.  But how much pain, lost years and lost
<br>
lives might you avoid if you used that wonderful brain to
<br>
organize, oppose and protest now or at least support those who
<br>
do?
<br>
<p>So what will it take?  Memetic engineering yes.  But also more
<br>
active stuff that gives notice right now that we will not stand
<br>
for the nonsense comming in SSSCA.  We must go viral and flood
<br>
the congress critters with mail and phone calls and infect
<br>
everyone we can with the importance of doing likewise.  We need
<br>
marches and demonstrations in Washington and throughout the
<br>
country as soon as we can organize them.  We needed them already
<br>
for DMCA and its early victims but it is better late than
<br>
never.  We need lawyers and legal entanglements for bringing the
<br>
IP police state policies down.  We need legal protests and test
<br>
cases, editorials, letter to editors.  We need teach-ins. Can we
<br>
reach a broad enough coalition to force the politicians to take
<br>
notice?  I don't know.  But we must try in all ways that make
<br>
sense to try.  
<br>
<p>We must start asap.  Preferably the protests should begin even
<br>
before this gross legislative miscarriage is even officially a
<br>
bill before Congress.
