<p>
Just got this in from my local renewables guy. I suggest that folks
<br>
interested in renewables contact their congressmonsters to support this
<br>
bill....
<br>
<p>Dear Mike,
<br>
I am writing to you today to ask for your support for a newly introduced 
<br>
bill in the federal Congress, HR 2322, the &quot;Home and Farm Wind Systems
<br>
Act 
<br>
of 2001&quot;. This bill has been introduced by Rep. J.C. Watts, Jr (R-OK),
<br>
and 
<br>
three other co-sponsors. We are hoping to have many other co-sponsors
<br>
sign 
<br>
on. This is where you come in. Congressman need to hear your support for 
<br>
this bill in order to become interested, and to sign on. Read on for
<br>
more 
<br>
details, a sample letter, and info on how to email your Congressman.
<br>
<p>We need folks from all over the country to email their congressman. The 
<br>
more co-sponsors, the better. The energy debate is getting hot in the 
<br>
House, and now is the time to move it in a sustainable direction!
<br>
<p>If you have any questions regarding this email, please email me at 
<br>
<a href="mailto:global@sover.net?Subject=Re:%20Federal%20Wind%20Farm%20tax%20credit%20needs%20support...&In-Reply-To=&lt;3B49C29E.F15176D0@datamann.com&gt;">global@sover.net</a>, with the term HR 2322 in the Subject line.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
<p>Jeff

<p>SAMPLE LETTER
<br>
<p>I would appreciate your support of HR 2322, the &quot;Home and Farm Wind
<br>
Systems 
<br>
Act of 2001&quot;. This bill would provide a 30% federal tax credit for farm
<br>
and 
<br>
residential wind mill systems for the next ten years. This would be a
<br>
great 
<br>
opportunity for citizens to act to contribute to a solution to the
<br>
energy 
<br>
crisis, as well as a way for them to truly lower their monthly utility 
<br>
bills.
<br>
<p>I hope you will co-sponsor this legislation.
<br>
<p>MORE INFO
<br>
<p>Last week Rep. J.C. Watts, Jr (R-OK) and three other Congressmen
<br>
introduced 
<br>
HR 2322, the Home and Farm Wind Energy Systems Act of 2001.  HR 2322
<br>
would
<br>
provide a 30% federal tax credit to individuals and businesses that
<br>
install 
<br>
small wind energy systems (up to 75 kW) during the next ten years.  The
<br>
credit would cover both on-grid and off-grid systems.  The timing of HR
<br>
2322 is good because the U.S. House of Representatives will start
<br>
preparing 
<br>
an energy bill within the next few weeks.
<br>
<p>In order for HR 2322 to be enacted we think we will need to generate
<br>
hundreds of e-mails, phone calls, and letters to Congress so that we can
<br>
build up an impressive list of Congressional co-sponsors. HR 876, the
<br>
extension bill for the Production Tax Credit for large wind turbines,
<br>
for
<br>
example, has over 140 co-sponsors (but, they had a four month head
<br>
start).  A co-sponsor is a member of Congress that has agreed to have
<br>
his
<br>
or her name listed as a supporter of the bill.
<br>
<p>So, I'm asking for your help and the help of anyone else you can
<br>
muster.  Background information, the AWEA press release, a link to the
<br>
bill 
<br>
language, and a mostly painless procedure for determining your
<br>
Representative and sending him or her an e-mail message can be found
<br>
through the Bergey Windpower home page, <a href="http://www.bergey.com">http://www.bergey.com</a>. Just
<br>
click 
<br>
on the HR 2322 graphic at the top of the page. (OR, you can go to the 
<br>
<a href="http://congress.org">http://congress.org</a> page, and click on the &quot;Elected Officials page after 
<br>
entering your zip code.)
<br>
<p>There has not been a federal tax credit for small wind systems since
<br>
1985.  I hope you will agree with me that its time the federal
<br>
government
<br>
got back in the game.  Jamie Steve, AWEA's legislative Director,
<br>
believes
<br>
that we only need 3 - 10 messages or calls to a Congressional office to
<br>
get 
<br>
them to co-sponsor, so by all means please call a few of your
<br>
friends.  After all, who wouldn't want a $5 a month electric bill.
<br>
<p>You can make a difference.  AWEA and the small wind turbine industry are
<br>
working hard as well.  I think we have a real chance.  Please help.
<br>
<p>Thanks very much,
<br>
Mike Bergey
<br>
Chairman, AWEA Small Wind Turbine Committee
