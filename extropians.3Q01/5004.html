<p>AFAICT that's how it is right now.  Wealthy suburbanites send their
<br>
kids to acceptable, even good free public schools, the poor send
<br>
their kids to rotten public schools.  I went to Catholic schools,
<br>
but the times I've been inside public schools, I've noted a stark
<br>
difference between those in wealthy areas (relatively well maintained)
<br>
and those in poor areas (literally reeking).  To me, that doesn't
<br>
sit right, particularly not from a system often apologized for
<br>
because it, and only it, supposedly provides everyone with an equal
<br>
shot at getting a decent education.
<br>
<p>I think the current inequality of public education goes a long way
<br>
towards explaining the near universal support it enjoys, outside
<br>
of radical free marketers (fundies aren't against public education,
<br>
they just want a piece of the action) -- the well off do get a
<br>
decent &quot;free&quot; education for their children, so they have little
<br>
incentive to advocate change, and the poor don't have as much
<br>
political clout, and have been hoodwinked by the educational
<br>
establishment in any case.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;...
<br>
<p>Concerning science education, the Wall Street Journal had an article
<br>
a week or so ago about a superb maths teacher in NYC (he was
<br>
previously coach for the Romanian national math team) who is thinking
<br>
about leaving (much to the chagrin of students at his schools)
<br>
because with his skills he can easily make much more. Same article
<br>
quoted figures for one school district. I don't remember the exact
<br>
figures or where the district was (I think a big east coast city),
<br>
but the ration of applicants/open positions for math/science teachers
<br>
was tiny, for English teachers that ratio was huge. Again, I don't
<br>
remember the numbers, but my impression was that it would be easier
<br>
to get into an ivy league school than to get an English teaching
<br>
job in that school district.
<br>
<p>What this says to me is that science/math teachers are underpaid,
<br>
and other teachers are possibly overpaid. Unfortunately the teacher
<br>
unions will never agree to allow differential pay. They won't even
<br>
contemplate merit pay. It's just how long you've been in the system.
<br>
What kind of results do you expect?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;...
<br>
<p>My pet education reform:  Instead of free elementary and high school
<br>
everyone gets some amount (say $3k for discussion) each year for
<br>
education expenses, broadly construed, but they don't get it till
<br>
they turn 18.  So at 18, an individual gets $54k to spend on their
<br>
education.  Why?  Parents would then bear the full costs of raising
<br>
their children, and children would get the full benefit of the
<br>
taxpayers' largess, just at the age when some realize that education
<br>
really is important.  I think children do deserve some help, they
<br>
never asked to be born after all.  Free daycare/public school is
<br>
of more benefit to parents than it is to kids IMO.
