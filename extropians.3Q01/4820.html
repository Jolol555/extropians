<em>&gt; Naah.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you examine the &quot;eye-witness&quot; accounts of meetings with the Greys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the other guys with an open mind, you will notice after a bit that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whole thing reeks of the Fair Folk -- sidhe, elves, what have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you. In fact, most of those alien abduction stories are dead-ringers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for what would, a century or more ago, have been &quot;away with the fairies&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stories. 
</em><br>
<p>Moreover, as I've demonstrated in the past with my logistical
<br>
calculations, in order to maintain the level of sightings and abductions
<br>
that are claimed, on a constant basis, would require a fleet of UFO's on
<br>
earth in the order of 1000 vehicles, with a support infrastructure of at
<br>
least 100,000 aliens, living here, to support and maintain this fleet.
<br>
This would also result in a minimum of 1 UFO crash every year, up to as
<br>
many as 6 crashes a year, some of which would crash into populated areas
<br>
and be witnessed and photographed by large numbers of people.
<br>
<p>I'm more inclined to believe Steve Witham's position about crypto-dirt:
<br>
having nanoscopic probes tweaking our brains in our sleep, induced by
<br>
magnetic fields or direct stimulation (as demonstrated by Persinger, et
<br>
al) to have abduction or other hypnogogic hallucinations is a more
<br>
reasonable explaination if one is to accept the other-intelligence cause
<br>
of these experiences.
