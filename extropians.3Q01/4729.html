<em>&gt; &gt; Double the size of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the class and you can drop prices dramatically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You'd think so, but that's not the way it works in the US, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where greedy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coprophages run the system and have no interest in efficiency 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education. Double the size of the class and they will demand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more security,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more assistants, higher pay, and a larger campus and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facilities, all of which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will more than double the cost per student.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --J. R.
</em><br>
<p>Greedy?! Where are the non-greedy capitalists? I don't have a problem with
<br>
people being greedy because I understand that they don't control the market
<br>
prices. If some school cost too much for the services they provide, they
<br>
would go under. Only HUGE organizations like OPEC can organize competing
<br>
companies to collaborate to fix prices. The book &quot;Capitalism the unknown
<br>
ideal&quot; by Ayn Rand handles these issues of price fixing and monopolies quite
<br>
well.
<br>
<p>Also, whats the difference between self-intererest and greed? Every
<br>
explanation I've heard went something like &quot;When you have or want TOO much&quot;,
<br>
as if that could ever be defined (or should be, and by whom). Remember, its
<br>
greed driving those supermarkets to drop the price of sugar 10 cents to
<br>
undercut their competitors.
