<p>Come ON Harvey! Did I say that they were genetically predisposed? No, I
<br>
did not. Recognising that members of certain cultures, as a result of
<br>
being canalized in those cultures, have predispositions toward certain
<br>
activities, behavior, attitudes, etc. is NOT racist. If you think it is,
<br>
your definition of racism is HIGHLY messed up. Is saying &quot;Americans have
<br>
a cultural predisposition toward baseball and apple pie&quot; racist?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I doubt anyone here would say my statements about jazz or sushi lovers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are racist. It is only when such cultural generalizations are made which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; illustrate members of that culture in a negative light do people try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; apply the 'racist' label to them. If it doesn't work for positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; statements but does for negative statements, it's not racism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree.  This is where some people get screwed up saying that unfair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discrimination is racist while affirmative action to undo unfairness is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racist.  Both policies are racist whether they are intended to help or harm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Both policies are racist whether they turn out to be truthful or fictitious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Decision-making based on race is racism no matter what.
</em><br>
<p>Both policies are racist because someone is always harmed by either
<br>
form. There is no positive net benefit of either policy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is where I strongly argue for objective definitions.  The defense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against racism should not be &quot;but it's true!&quot;.  Or else any racist activity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be defended as not racist.  Hitler would claim he was not racist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because Jews really are subhuman.  Is this a defense?  I don't think so.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was still evaluating a whole group based on their race not on their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual merits.  This is the definition of racism.  Negativity or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Falsehood do no have anything to do with it.  Otherwise, there would be no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion.  Nobody would choose the side of negativity and falsehood.
</em><br>
<p>This is really bull, Harvey. Hitler (I'll overlook the fact that you've
<br>
hitlered yourself out) could claim anything. If it was not supported by
<br>
the facts (i.e. IQ, academic achievement, economic achievement, etc)
<br>
then his claim is baseless and is therefore racist. If it is true, he
<br>
would simply be recognising actual facts, despite the fact that he is
<br>
Hitler, and therefore his opinion is automatically demonized in the
<br>
minds of the members of this list.
<br>
<p>Are these racist statements?:
<br>
<p>&quot;White guys can't dunk&quot;
<br>
&quot;White folk can't dance&quot;
<br>
&quot;Only blacks have soul&quot;
<br>
&quot;Jews are a gutter race&quot;
<br>
<p>Every one of these statements have not only been made by prominent black
<br>
leaders, but are generally accepted among the black minority as true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But what about actions that indirectly causes people of one race to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; treated predominantly different than other races, for instance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; geographic based discrimination (like 'risky zip code' restrictions on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mail order deliveries to zip codes with high fraud rates)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not based on the race of the person ordering the item.  Therefore it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not racism.  It may effect more blacks than whites because of the racial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makeup of a particular zip code.  But whites and blacks in that zip code are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treated the same.  In fact, no one knows the race of the recipient of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; piece of mail.  No decisions or even knowledge of race enter into this.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but liberals say that this IS, in fact, racism. For example, a
<br>
recent court case actually said that these 'risky zip' policies are
<br>
racist, and court cases have also ruled that banks that make loan
<br>
decisions (especially for mortgages and cars) even partly on zip code of
<br>
the customer are practicing racism.
