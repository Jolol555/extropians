</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;In his celebrated book...Kuhn went a step further and argued that in scientific

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kuhn tentatively attacked the view that science makes progress toward objective truths:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;We may, to be more precise, have to relinquish the notion, explicit or implicit, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes of paradigm carry scientists and those who learn from them closer and closer to

<em>&gt; the truth.&quot;  Kuhn's book lately seems to have become read (or at least quoted) as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manifesto for a general attack on the presumed objectivity of science.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought S.W. said more;  but in any case, that explains where Mike

</em><br>
<p>Thank you, Lee. I don't have my Kuhn handy (currently living out of a
<br>
suitcase at my parents' while I'm unemployed) to contest others, but
<br>
this is, to me, a most important conclusion of his, which others have
<br>
picked up on. I've also read reviews of Kuhn by others who were with him
<br>
at Harvard at the time he wrote these works, that have generally
<br>
concluded that Kuhn posessed the common lay left winger opinion that
<br>
scientists are simply bottle washers and bean counters who are
<br>
politically active, and that science is as much propaganda as art is.
<br>
<p>While I'm sure that Kuhn has something positive to say about the
<br>
progress of science, but his work has to be filtered by the fact that he
<br>
was as much victimized by Marxist theology as other members of the elite
<br>
western intelligentsia in the 1930s, 40s and 50s.
