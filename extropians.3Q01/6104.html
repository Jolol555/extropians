<em>&gt; True (although M$ and RIAA might disagree). But it is part of the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meme complex: information must be controlled. The originating reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are of course different, but the basic problem for all the interests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behind these systems is that if information is power, then it must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlled so that they (and those groups they work for, including of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course civilian governments) can retain it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Actions must be monitored and controlled.  But this does not
<br>
automatically mean that information must be.  Music and DVDs are
<br>
hardly a munition in any stretch of imagination. :-) 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; transparent society might at least keep some civil liberties and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; remain an open society, but the cultural changes needed will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; rather wrenching.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The biggest change required is that governments be severely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; limited from interfering with individual rights and with any and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all behaviors that do not directly harm or defraud others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Transparency is not safe unless governments are forbidden to act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the information received to suppress unpopular attitudes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; activities or to attempt to force compliance with government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; endorsed positions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The transparency option needs a big number of what Brin calls
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;antibodies&quot;, those people brave and tenacious enough to keep poiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out abuses and demanding their rights. Without enough of them it will of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course not work. This is why the transparency option needs more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just small cameras, it needs a cultural awareness of the need for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom and the need to stand up for one's rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I agree with this completely.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But who gets to define what is and isn't abuse?  Some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; current definitions of those in power in the US and elsewhere in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the world would lead straight to a more rigid and horrific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; totalitarian state than the world has ever seen.  As long as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; political theory and practice is highly irrational, our best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; protection is in what privacy we have and what inefficiencies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for enforcement of government will that exist now.  I will live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (but not happily of course) with the threat of terrorism rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than under the grim certainty of a totalitarian state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True. Of course, totalitarian states tend to breed terrorists too, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you will not even be safe in that case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In a totalitarian state the terrorists often really are the
<br>
freedom fighters, as for instance, the French Underground in
<br>
WWII.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In the end abuse has to be citizen-defined, and it needs to be defined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in such a way that the power of definition cannot be taken away from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizenship. How to achieve that is an important question, I really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope we can rise to the challenge and come up with creative answers that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be implemented.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Of course the question comes up of where we find these citizens
<br>
wise enough to define this well.  It certainly cannot be a
<br>
majority in a world dominated by colossal ignorance.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The Fifth Amendment should cover the right of any and all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; persons not to diverge their electronic information.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information should be seen as a direct extension of the person's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mind.  It should be as illegal for the court to order it open as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the court to order truth-serum to be administered to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; defendant.  Nothing less imho will protect us as individuals as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we become more intimately augmented by electronic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computational devices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree, but the worrying trend right now is in the other direction. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noticed yesterday that brain fingerprinting is now admissible in US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; courts, although I guess that is hard to do on a resisting subject. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to informational integrity is important, and despite the awful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementations of it here in the EU, at least some parts of it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting into law (unfortunately, just parts and there are many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradictions with equally sweeping police rights). Of course, this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an area where crypto can help a bit, but we still need the legal and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical infrastructure to make the use of crypto legal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Crypto could grow out of seeing our computational resources as
<br>
extensions of our own person and therefore as legitimate to
<br>
protect from involuntary search and seizure.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I could see a more transparent society (in both directions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; public and private) with and only with severe restrictions on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government and corporate meddling with individual rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a feedback loop: in a somewhat transparent society, anybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meddling with your rights is more easily exposed, and meddling doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pay as much as before. That helps make the society more transparent. On
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other hand, the reverse is also true. That is why we need those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antibodies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I accented the &quot;in both directions&quot; because of some court
<br>
rulings and legislation in the US prohibiting citizens from
<br>
recording the actions of public officials although the public
<br>
officials claim every right to snoop on and record private
<br>
citizens and transactions.  Transparency cannot be a 1-way
<br>
mirror. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; On today's tragedy, I wonder whether these planes were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simultaneously hijacked in a coordinated matter (difficult) or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whether the automatic guidance systems were somehow subverted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and made impervious to manula override.  Just a thought.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the first; to my knowledge (which is admittedly near zero) it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not possible to completely override manual in airplanes.  This event
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might however lead to the reverse: what if planes could be remote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlled in the event of hijacking? I can envison a cryptographically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secure remote control system that could in certain emergencies override
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the pilot. This is likely a Bad Idea - both a hacking opportunity par
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excellence (even if it is based on some clever hardware scheme there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always mistakes), and it would undermine the trust of the pilot and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plane. However, some might think it might be worth it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>If ground could take control in a hijacking this might deter
<br>
would-be hijackers.  Or simply offer them a different means as
<br>
you mention.
