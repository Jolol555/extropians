Why do you believe what you do? Why do I? We'd all like to believe that we 
<br>
have arrived at the conclusions most tenable after dispassionate logical 
<br>
analyses. I'm sure we all realize that there are other factors that play into 
<br>
the formation of our beliefs, but most of us still feel that logic and reason 
<br>
play a large role. What would we do with if we found out that reason is a 
<br>
minor factor?
<br>
There are several lines of evidence that are pushing me toward considering 
<br>
this possibility. One idea, not new to most on this list, I'm sure, is that 
<br>
free will is an illusion, and that all our behavior/beliefs are simply the 
<br>
outcomes of the laws of physics. On this view, I am an atheist, not because 
<br>
it seems the most reasonable position on the issue to me, but for the same 
<br>
reason that my car accelerates when I push the gas peddle. It simply must be 
<br>
that way, given the dynamics of the system in question. 
<br>
One way to look at the above is that one can view a particular brain 
<br>
phenomenon at equally accurate though quite disparate levels of analysis: 
<br>
reasoning in brains, on the one hand, and neurophysiology or simply physics 
<br>
on the other, can all describe the same brain process. The physical and 
<br>
neurophysiological descriptions don't invalidate the cognitive description. I 
<br>
can say that, anyway. I'm not sure how much I believe it. It's discomfiting 
<br>
to think that the causes of my beliefs can be described completely without 
<br>
reference to reason. 
<br>
<p>The recent presidential election snafu also gave me pause in considering why 
<br>
we believe what we do. I don't see any particular consonance between 
<br>
conservative or Republican thought and not wanting recounts, on the one hand, 
<br>
and liberal or Democratic thought and wanting recounts, on the other. Yet 
<br>
it's my impression that a large majority of people who had opinions as to 
<br>
whether recounts should be undertaken had the opinion that was most likely to 
<br>
aid their favored candidate's election. I wanted Gore to win. I wanted 
<br>
recounts. I thought I wanted recounts because that seemed the fairest way to 
<br>
resolve such a close count. But maybe the fact that I wanted Gore to win was 
<br>
a much more important factor in determining my position on recounts. Maybe 
<br>
preference for Gore or Bush was the most important factor in determining why 
<br>
all of us had the positions we did regarding recounts. That seems a rather 
<br>
troubling prospect.
<br>
<p>Another line of evidence that seems to minimize the importance of reasoning 
<br>
comes from brain-damaged or hypnotized people. Many, with otherwise intact 
<br>
faculties, display an impressive ability to believe rather silly things and 
<br>
come up with any convenient rationalization that comes to mind to explain 
<br>
their positions. We may know why they suddenly got up and went to the 
<br>
bathroom (post-hypnotic suggestion) or why they deny their obvious paralysis 
<br>
(stroke and concommitant brain damage), but that's not why they think they 
<br>
did or believe these things. Perhaps we, as unhypnotized, unbrain-damaged 
<br>
folks, are in the same boat.

<br>
of recounts got my a little disconcerted.
