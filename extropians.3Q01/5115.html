&quot;Anyone have any comments on why this idea hasn't been pursued
<br>
more seriously in the U.S. or Russia?  It would seem to me
<br>
the tricks here require relatively lightweight machinery
<br>
for performing the liquefication and separation.&quot;
<br>
<p>If it makes orbital access cheaper or more effecient, then probably the
<br>
United states foolish 'Cost plus 10' program.  Robert Zubring describes this
<br>
better in his book 'Entering space'  Basically some politician some years
<br>
ago decided that it would be bad for evil corporations to make too much
<br>
money off the US goverment for contracts and decided to propose legislation
<br>
that contracts had to be paid on a 'Cost plus 10' program.  In other words,
<br>
whatever the project cost, plus 10 percent, is what they would make.  No
<br>
bidding, no competiting, no nothing.  Of course, this meant that programs
<br>
now not only didnt have the incentive to make better cheaper products, they
<br>
actually had the incentive to use older, more expensive more innefiecient
<br>
products.  The construction process now had to be closely examined as well,
<br>
to make sure those nasty corporations werent cheating the government, of
<br>
course this meant a line by line itemized expenditure, which meant more
<br>
people, which meant higher costs...This is why we still use rockets from 30
<br>
years ago.  
<br>
<p>Sorry, I am done with my rant...
