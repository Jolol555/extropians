<p><p>Indeed.  My &quot;high school education only&quot; uncle, who did in fact work for
<br>
many years as a construction worker, eventually became the big nail-pounding
<br>
fish in a medium sized pond in that business when he started his own little
<br>
company.  His estate (including the riding stables) sits in the middle of
<br>
one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the US, and he earned every penny of
<br>
it in the true fashion of the American Dream.  I would say that his generic
<br>
1950s/1960s public education served him pretty well.  However, I wonder if
<br>
he could have done the same if educated in today's system.
<br>
<p>While agree that virtually no Mexican construction workers are going to do
<br>
the same, I also agree with Eugene that you can't assume that *everyone* is
<br>
limited to their initial conditions.  After all, two-thirds of the
<br>
millionaires in the U.S. are blue collar workers.
