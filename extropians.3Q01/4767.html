This is a long and blathering post, so skip down to the ******'s if you're
<br>
bored.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  I would say there's at least a 5% chance that one or more of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reports represents actual alien contact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wow!  That seems amazingly high to me.  Following Robin's precepts, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must have seen some evidence that I missed.  What collection of alien
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contact reports have enough plausible details to make you go that high?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I must admit that I haven't studied the issue, and so have only been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exposed to third- and fourth-hand accounts of what has appeared in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Enquirer since I read one of Von Daniken's books in high school.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And in case I missed something earlier in the conversation, is there some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;specific referent to &quot;those reports&quot;, or is it a generic for all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;popularly-known reports lumped together?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If by &quot;aliens&quot; you mean the Little Grey Men of standard UFO
<br>
lore, then 5% doesn't seem totally unreasonable... I would guess somewhere
<br>
around 1%.  The key is to drop the assumtion that they are aliens, and
<br>
consider the slight possibility that they might be genetically engineered
<br>
future humans coming back in time to study us Neanderthals.  The LGM have
<br>
similar size, body plan, gravity tolerance, pressure tolerance, oxygen
<br>
tolerance, etc. Oxygen is nasty stuff- very good at destroying organic
<br>
molecules.  Only through a fluke of evolution can we withstand this toxic
<br>
waste and even use its reactivity as an essential energy source.  If you
<br>
believe stories of human-&quot;alien&quot; hybrids (which I consider very unlikely),
<br>
then the LGM cannot possibly be aliens because evolution would never
<br>
produce a compatible biochemistry from a separate genesis.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technology of the LGM is much too primitive, sometimes even
<br>
retro.  Due to the immensity of cosmic timescales, any randomly selected
<br>
alien civilization should be hundreds of millions of years more advanced
<br>
than us.  Any highly advanced technology we can imagine (within the laws
<br>
of physics) should be Stone Age to them.  This includes nanotech,
<br>
consciousness downloading, etc.  Yet the LGM use anal probes and big,
<br>
resource-intensive ships to collect their samples.  If a logic switch can
<br>
be built with about 100 atoms then it should have a volume of about 1
<br>
cubic nanometer and be much faster than a neuron.  A eukaryotic cell
<br>
(about 1000 cubic microns) could hold a trillion such switches, which is
<br>
more than the number of neurons in the brain.  True aliens could
<br>
construct microscopic laboratories intelligent enough to conduct research
<br>
on us without arousing any suspicion.  No need to abduct us with a
<br>
dungeon-like UFO, molest us with anal probes, and hide behind a botched
<br>
memory wipe.  Many debunk the alien-visitor stories because they are too
<br>
fantastic to believe, but I debunk them because they are nowhere near
<br>
fantastic enough.  They have human lack of imagination written all over
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1% probability I give to the LGM reflects the low probability
<br>
that there is an undiscovered method of time travel or parallel-universe-
<br>
hopping which is so easy we will develop it before we develop all the
<br>
Extropian fetish technologies.  Since we are already doing preliminary
<br>
fiddlings with nanotech and AI, we probably have at most 100 years before
<br>
we use these technologies to radically transform our society and even
<br>
ourselves.  Also, most current theories of time travel or universe-hopping
<br>
require some sort of portal, which must be created and kept open by the
<br>
inhabitants of both worlds.  Such portals require energies and engineering
<br>
on cosmic scales, so we certainly don't have one (unless you believe the
<br>
crazy tales of the &quot;Philadelphia Experiment&quot;).  For enhnced humans to be
<br>
here today they must use an unknown &quot;easy&quot; method of travel, or they must
<br>
have a old portal which they discovered (or borrowed) in Star-Trek fasion.
<br>
It is much more likely that the LGM instead come from the inner universe
<br>
of repressed sexual fantasies, etc.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of alien civilizations is also very problematic.
<br>
Feynman put it best: &quot;Where are they&quot;?  Neutron stars are intensely
<br>
studied and would make an excellent source of energy, but we haven't seen
<br>
any alien energy-extraction efforts.  Our own existence shows that this
<br>
solar system hasn't been devoured by alien nanobots.  If there are any
<br>
civilizations at all between here and the Coma Cluster, then space should
<br>
be teeming with aliens spreading at relativistic speeds on
<br>
sand-grain-sized colony ships.  Evolution and empty space would favor
<br>
ravenous expansionists, but even with a strict &quot;prime directive&quot;,
<br>
something is bound to slip through.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the matter of vaccuum phase transitions (you may
<br>
have heard the recent paranoia about experiments at Brookhaven).  A phase
<br>
transition would be much like an &quot;Ice-9&quot; phenomenon of the laws of physics
<br>
themselves.  Once triggered, it would spread accross the universe at the
<br>
speed of light.  In its wake it might cause ordinary matter to become
<br>
radioactively unstable, or it might spread out in a blast wave,
<br>
incinerating everything.  A waiting phase transition would always produce
<br>
a &quot;cosmological constant&quot;, and we have just recently obtained strong
<br>
evidence of one in our universe.  This does not imply a waiting phase
<br>
transition, but if there is one associated with it and if the transition
<br>
would spread as a blast wave, then the case against aliens is almost
<br>
airtight.  I calculate that aliens triggering the cosmological-constant
<br>
phase transition would escape with their solar system unscathed, but all
<br>
other solar systems would be destroyed without warning.  The temptation
<br>
would be enormous.  If the universe had even a few alien despots,
<br>
psychopaths, religious fanatics, and paranoid cold-war types with their
<br>
tentacles on the Big Red Button, then we wouldn't be here.  This is
<br>
all wild speculation of course, but it is fun, and it shows just one way
<br>
in which physics alone might answer the alien question.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the only major bottleneck is the evolution of complex
<br>
multicellular life, which took 3 billion years on Earth.  This may be the
<br>
only small probability in the Drake Equation.  70 extrasolar gas giants
<br>
have been discovered to date, and some probably have hospitable moons.
<br>
Life appeared so soon after the Earth's formation that it probably
<br>
evolves wherever chemically possible, living even on other worlds in this
<br>
solar system.  Sentinence evolved here in two separate lineages- dolphins
<br>
and primates.  So, if life forms easily and if it is possible for
<br>
Earth-like planets to form with a 6 billion year head start on us, then
<br>
why is it so lonely out there?  Comments?
