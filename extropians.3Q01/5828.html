LOS ANGELES, California (Reuters) -- A NASA scientist said Tuesday the next
<br>
generation of firefighting technology has been built: a robot plane able to
<br>
circle for up to 24 hours over wildfires, beaming video images and data back
<br>
to Earth computers by satellite.
<br>
<p>The Altus II unmanned plane, which will make a demonstration flight for
<br>
firefighters Thursday, employs cutting edge technology usually seen in
<br>
military aircraft, giving fire officials a real-time view of fires that can
<br>
burn over hundreds of thousands of acres.
<br>
<p>The plane could map dozens of fires and topographical features in a day, never
<br>
endangering a pilot.
<br>
<p>NASA Project scientist Steve Wegener said such technology would catapult fire
<br>
crews into a new era in firefighting.
<br>
<p>&quot;Right now they have an infrared system that is using very overloaded and old
<br>
technology,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>&quot;They have maybe three planes go up and take a few pictures in the evening,
<br>
getting two or three fires at the most. Then they have to land and hand a
<br>
piece of paper to a runner to take it out to the fire camp. It's very labor
<br>
intensive.&quot;
<br>
<p>NASA unveiled the Altus II, developed and built with privately owned General
<br>
Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. of San Diego, California, during a fire
<br>
season in which wildfires raged across much of the western United States and
<br>
at least two people died fighting wildfires.
<br>
<p>The plane is a variant of the &quot;Predator&quot; unmanned surveillance aircraft
<br>
manufactured by General Atomics and used by the U.S. Air Force.
<br>
<p>&quot;These unmanned (aircraft) are really pretty special because they can be put
<br>
in dangerous situations and not put a pilot at risk,&quot; Wegener said.
<br>
&quot;Firefighting is dangerous. If we can make it less dangerous that's a great
<br>
step all around.&quot;
<br>
<p>He said the plane sends thermal imagery through a satellite link and onto the
<br>
Internet, where firefighters could access it to make minute-by-minute
<br>
decisions.
<br>
<p>&quot;They will have a real-time product to aid them in disaster management,&quot; he
<br>
said. &quot;We could also do floods, earthquakes and pollution events. What we're
<br>
providing is a snapshot within minutes of taking the imagery.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;And the exciting part of this is that its a geo-registered image. The image
<br>
is built up in proportion to lay exactly over a map with exact known locations
<br>
of every pixel that puts accurate imagery in the hands of disaster managers
<br>
who can trust it move resources around,&quot; Wegener said.
<br>
<p>&quot;They can layer this image over any computerized map they use -- for example a
<br>
topographical map or a Red Cross map.&quot;
<br>
<p>He said the Altus II, which is controlled by pilots on the ground, still
<br>
needed to clear a few hurdles, including regulatory issues with the Federal
<br>
Aviation Administration.
