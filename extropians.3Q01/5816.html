<em>&gt; I guess you intended this as a kind of joke?
</em><br>
<p>Maybe I had too much guilibity or perhaps igorance, so I have this crazy idea that if I post this URL to other people, then maybe they can tell me how to classify it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; After all, why crosspost it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so widely (and to *these* lists) if not to poke fun at net crackpots by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imitating them?
</em><br>
<p>I thought that cross-posting would perhaps cause attention, but not so much attention. Anyway, I don't think crackpots sound like an appropriate term, nor would &quot;cross-classification&quot; people from different catagories together.
<br>
<p>I think some of these people have valid ideas for consideration; they just use different systems and terms to present them that could cause misinterpretion with a lot of people.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Of course, the likeliest result is that you have now been plonked by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even more people. 
</em><br>
<p>I suppose that the probability of getting plonked has a positive correlation to the number of posts one generates, so I think perhaps some had actually taken the effort to do that. However, I could not change my behaviour if people plonk me quietly rather than tell me what they dislike.
<br>
<p>Anyway, thanks for your suggestion to classify the article as a joke. For now, it does not seem funny or perculiar enough to me yet.
