</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;My reaction, on the whole, is that people are trying to forcibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;make this into one of the most significant events in world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;history.  I don't think it is.  Not intrinsically.  I understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the impulse to magnify the importance.  One doesn't want several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;thousand people to have died for something that doesn't ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;change the course of history.  But I think we'll see similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;events in the future, and I don't think those will change the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;course of history either.  It's just a lot of unnecessary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;pointless deaths.
</em><br>
<p>Well, only time will tell which of us is right.  I think the future will 
<br>
look back at this attack as a sea change in history, similar to the Nazi 
<br>
holocaust.  Prior to the holocaust everyone knew that such inhuman barbarism 
<br>
was *possible*, but no one expected it would actually rear its ugly head.  
<br>
Just as before September 11, 2001 we all knew that such an effective 
<br>
terrorist attack was possible, yet no one actually expected it here in the 
<br>
safe haven that is the US.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From here on out, no possibility is outside the realm of expectation.  We 
</em><br>
now know that, given the chance, terrorists will step up their attacks to 
<br>
the nth degree - including chemical, biological, nuclear and eventually 
<br>
nanotech &quot;grey goo&quot; scenarios.  If they are not eliminated, the question is 
<br>
no longer &quot;if&quot; but &quot;when.&quot;  Of course there were many who expected such 
<br>
escalation even before last Tuesday.  The difference now is that we are 
<br>
*all* believers.
<br>
<p>So where's the big sea change?  Here it is: what measures would you aprove 
<br>
of to prevent, say, a biological warfare attack in midtown Manhattan?  The 
<br>
answer most Americans would give?  &quot;Anything and everything.&quot;
<br>
<p>We are about to witness a full out campaign to strengthen the security of 
<br>
the &quot;free&quot; world.  What does this mean?  I'm not sure.  But I know it will 
<br>
mean a hell of a lot more than just the end of curbside check-in at the 
<br>
airport.  My guess is that, for good or ill, it will mean the acceleration 
<br>
of the transparent society I have called for.  It has already resulted in 
<br>
the unhindered roll-out of Carnivore by the FBI.  I'm sure that there will 
<br>
be continual escalation in the use of Carnivore- and Echelon-type 
<br>
surveillance for the foreseeable future.
<br>
<p>I personally believe Tuesday's attack will impact innumerable US policies, 
<br>
both foreign and domestic - immigration, budgetary, foreign relations - 
<br>
virtually everything.  I don't think it will get so far as to result in a 
<br>
full on police state, but Big Brother will soon be looking over our 
<br>
shoulders like never before and anyone who complains about it will, at best, 
<br>
be ignored and, at worst, be given the McCarthy treatment.
<br>
<p>Yes my friends, for good or bad, this changes everything.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
