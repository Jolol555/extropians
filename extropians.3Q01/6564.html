<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't believe that this is on the extropian list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Why not?  It is actually very good news that so many countries
<br>
are pulling together to stop insanities like that which occurred
<br>
on Tuesday.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; with european countries and cultures, and I'm sure that many europeans

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; every european and citizen of a NATO country on the list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't thank me. It was not me who decided to assist in kicking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ass of one of the poorest and misarable country on earth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Who said we are going to do that?  And how exactly do you think
<br>
they got so poor and miserable?  Could it have something to do
<br>
with the extremist fanatic government that is running them into
<br>
the Stone Age all by itself?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I am afraid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have seen a lot of very intelligent and cool headed reaction on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list yesterday. What I see today is a lot of nationalist and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bloodthursty PR. Some want to die for ideas, some are begging for war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and thank to all Europians to assist. And all this is on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropian list. I don't want to imagine the reaction of the masses...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No one begs for war.  But it is good to admit when war has
<br>
effectively been declared on you and you are under attack and to
<br>
act accordingly.  Anything less would be illogical and
<br>
suicidal.  Such would definitely not be at all extropic.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Don't misunderstand me. I was shocked by attack from the very first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minute. I spent a wonderfull evening on the top of the WTC last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; summer, so I could visualize and imagine the extent and cruelty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the events. I was thinking over and over again: how could they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do it? How is it possible? Why could not USA stop them? I am also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; angry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I think revenge leads only to spiralling violence and sorrow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And doing nothing at all leads to what?  Not hunting down and
<br>
destroying the perps does what?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I am afraid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American only know that they must hit somebody.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And that they must hit hard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But, They don't know who.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we do.  We must hit bin Laden and his organization hard. 
<br>
He declared war on us many years ago and we never took him
<br>
seriously.  Whether he was the mastermind behind Tuesday or not,
<br>
he is our sworn and active enemy.  We must do the same for any
<br>
other major terrorist groups that targets us.  And woe be to any
<br>
who try to forceably oppose our doing so.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The result will be that they will kill a lot of innocent people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for an idea. Only because they don't want to seem weak.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Incorrect.  We will kill those who have sworn to kill us and who
<br>
have now delivered bigtime on their committment before they can
<br>
deliver more of the same and worse.  
<br>
<p>Perhaps you don't want the responsibility of acting strongly.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It can only go wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>False.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; NATO will kill at least 10000 innocent people, women and children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Kabul.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Who says we are going to Kabul particularly?  We will not kill
<br>
innocents just to kill someone.  Any innocents that get killed
<br>
will be either accidental or directly a consequence of their
<br>
governments actions. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Of course it is easy. It will be even good for the economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American and European people will cheer and USA will reelect Bush.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No we won't.  The man has no fire and even less intelligence.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, it will generate a lot of people in afghanistan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who have lost their families, their houses, everything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A lot of people who have nothing to loose. Some million potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>They should have thought of this before sheltering bin Laden and
<br>
before setting up a government that would lead them to ruin.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Do you really believe that this is the proper way you to eliminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't think there are any better choices.  If you do then
<br>
please offer them.
