<em>&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm going to do my best to stay off this thread...:/
</em><br>
<p>My best wasn't good enough, but, at least, let me rename the thread, so we
<br>
don't have 2^n discussions going on at once under the same subject line.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do have some familiarity with such accounts of property and I find them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unconvincing. Moreover, they are difficult to reconcile with the idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property as understood by property lawyers. Without a detailed analysis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these accounts, however, the fact that you find them convincing and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't is not conclusive one way or the other.
</em><br>
<p>How much familiarity, since you seem unaware that many of the issues you
<br>
bring up have been discussed before, especially in regard to civic duties,
<br>
social responsibilities, and the limits to individual rights.  It's not like
<br>
Rand et al. ignored that stuff.
<br>
<p>As for what property lawyers understand, this depends on the lawyer.
<br>
Lawyers don't march in lock step with each other.  I've met some whose
<br>
convictions extend no further than winning a case or an argument, but there
<br>
are others who are interested in the truth.  And these latter types vary
<br>
too.
<br>
<p>But why would agreement with, say, current property law or some subset of
<br>
lawyers be relevant here?  This is only an argument from authority, though
<br>
I'm sure that's no what you intend.  Also, if someone is criticizing a
<br>
particular legal system from a standpoint outside that system, then it
<br>
hardly seems like they would base their critique on the system itself.  This
<br>
is kind of like quoting the Bible at atheists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, my questions to Jerry have actually been about exactly this: what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does he see as the moral limits of the law.
</em><br>
<p>And perhaps the legal limits of morality?:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As you'd know, some have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theorised that Nazi law was not law at all because it was inconsistent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the &quot;natural law&quot;. I don't go along with that myself - as a legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positivist, I find it highly implausible -
</em><br>
<p>Let's not restrict ourselves to the internet's favorite whipping boys, if
<br>
you are going criticize or rebell against some law, generally you're going
<br>
to do it from some rival standard -- i.e., not from the positivist view
<br>
(simplifying here) of what is _is_ right.  It could be from from a natural
<br>
law perspective, which underlies a lot of different thinkers from Aristotle
<br>
to the Pope.  It could also be from some other standard, such as
<br>
majoritarianism a la Bork, pure formalism a la Kant (who also has a foot in
<br>
the natural law tradition), economic efficiency as many economists do,
<br>
Constitutionalism, or something else.  You can't expect people who believe
<br>
in any of these to be legal positivists.  Again, it's like quoting Scripture
<br>
at the nonbeliever.  (And, as you know, I'm one of the nonbelievers.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I'd be interested to know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether you do or whether Jerry does.
</em><br>
<p>I would argue from the libertarian and Objectivist positions here.
<br>
Basically, killing or abusing people is wrong.  Governments that do such are
<br>
wrong and have no legitimate reason to be.  Laws which support such are
<br>
wrong and need not be obeyed.  In fact, to obey them is often to aid and
<br>
abet the rights violations.  Of course, it depends on the situation one
<br>
finds oneself in.
<br>
<p>(I don't agree with Michael Lorrey here.  Some people are innocent and
<br>
should not be condemned just because they didn't join the partisans or the
<br>
revolution right away.  Others are innocent through ignorance.  Of course,
<br>
some people are Quislings and the like, but my political goal is freedom NOT
<br>
revenge.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any event, you've misread me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which, of course may be the fault of the way I expressed myself) if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think I'm arguing that &quot;if it's legal it must be acceptable&quot; and that I go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on to develop a *separate* argument. The issue I'm trying to define
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throughout, as precisely as I can, is simply why it is wrong for the law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be what it is, ie to include tax legislation etc.
</em><br>
<p>You need to look into the conceptual foundations of the Law.  If you can't
<br>
do that, then you will be stuck with no way to answer the question.  Ask
<br>
yourself, Why government?  What necessitates government?  Do humans need it?
<br>
If so, what is the best form of government for them?  Are there any forms
<br>
that are bad for them?  There's a whole area known as political philosophy
<br>
(much as Molloy might despise the term) that attempts to answer these
<br>
questions.
<br>
<p>This will probably bring you into other fields, such as psychology,
<br>
sociology, history, economics, and epistemology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And this means that I want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a more general answer to the question: what kinds of laws are morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptable (or morally binding)?
</em><br>
<p>Those protecting individual rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In what circumstances is the imposition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an obligation by the state legitimate?
</em><br>
<p>You can't impose an obligation.  Obligations are freely entered into or they
<br>
are not obligations but duties or coercions.  But aside from this, the state
<br>
can only prohibit activities which abrogate individual rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think either of you has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answered this so far, or if you have I've missed it. I also raised a
</em><br>
further
<br>
<em>&gt; question briefly: what is the effect or significance of a law that should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been enacted (or should not have been part of the common law if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes to that)? How should we respond to such a law? But this *was*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separate; it was not central to my line of questioning.
</em><br>
<p>Any institution evolves.  I would hope that from here on that the law would
<br>
change in the direction of protecting individual rights through objective
<br>
law as defined by Rand in her &quot;The Nature of Government&quot; -- whether it be
<br>
privately or &quot;governmentally&quot; arrived at or enforced.
<br>
<p>Generally, a bad law need not be obeyed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have given at least the sketch of some answers to the overall question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of how you would criticise tax and defend a libertarian position, and I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grateful for that. I must report that your answers raise even more
</em><br>
questions
<br>
<em>&gt; in my mind &lt;g&gt;.
</em><br>
<p>My view is basically as before, individual rights, including those to
<br>
property, precede government, logically, morally, and historically.  If
<br>
government's only legitimate raison d'etre is to protect these rights, then
<br>
it is illegitimate for any government to use force to trample rights.
<br>
Taxation is one such instance of such trampling.  Ergo, taxation is not
<br>
legitimate.  Now, you might not accept this condensed version in whole or in
<br>
part, but this, in itself, does not make it wrong or invalid.
<br>
<p>(You might also want to check out some of the sources I cite in &quot;Anarchism,
<br>
Minarchism, and Freedom&quot; at
<br>
<a href="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Anarchism.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Anarchism.html</a> to add even more to your
<br>
reading list.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, FWIW, I find your views about social cohesion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counter-intuitive. Some of the reading you've suggested may throw up more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answers, and I realise I have raised a lot of issues without giving
</em><br>
answers
<br>
<em>&gt; of my own. I'm grateful for the citations because they expand the range of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material I'm aware of that a sophisticated philosophical libertarian might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rely on.
</em><br>
<p>Is it all that counterintuitive?  When most people forced to be part of
<br>
something or to fund something, they tend to become antagonistic toward that
<br>
something or the people involved.  In the case, e.g., of affirmative action,
<br>
a lot of people tend to become more racist, sexist, ethnocentric, etc.  At
<br>
the very least, it arms any irrational prejudices they might have.  (See
<br>
Thomas Sowell's _Preferential Policies: An International Perspective_ for
<br>
many more examples of how such policies have destabilized societies around
<br>
the world, from Sri Lanka to the South.)
<br>
<p>With taxation, it should be obvious that people often feel it hurts them --
<br>
because it does!:) -- and also feel animosity toward tax beneficiaries.
<br>
With government in general -- and I mean real world governments -- a lot of
<br>
people come to see this as their means to whatever they want.  Governments
<br>
use force to get what they want.  That's their nature.  So, if people use
<br>
government, it means they are using force against someone else to get what
<br>
they want.
<br>
<p>This applies even if you don't buy the individual rights thing.  After all,
<br>
when you force people to do something, you are generally not going to make
<br>
friends.  One of the worst possible things that can come out of this is not
<br>
that you'll get a bunch of libertarians running you out of the country, but
<br>
that people will come to adopt your ways and also use force to get what they
<br>
want.  This seems the lesson of the last century as governments grew bigger
<br>
and bigger, coming to control more and more aspects of human life.  (This
<br>
does not make it unique.  In all times, there seems a tendency for
<br>
governments to grow, usually only limited by technology (mostly), rival
<br>
governments (mostly), traditional restraints (barely), and internal
<br>
dissension (barely).)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
