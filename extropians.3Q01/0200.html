[various religious and social commentary snipped]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The problem for transhumanists is how to debunk _all_ religions equally.
</em><br>
<p>Why is this a goal for transhumanists?
<br>
<p>Picking your battles is a good thing; the need for religion or religion
<br>
substitutes (such as extropianism :) is so hardwired into the human mind and
<br>
social constructs that I would venture to say that changing the human
<br>
condition is the easiest way to make a dent in religion. Being Canute is
<br>
just not productive.
<br>
<p>I see no reasons as to why religions and transhumanism can't live side by
<br>
side. Religion managed to digest the Copernican revolution (no pun intended)
<br>
given a little time. Fundamentalists will always be fundamentalists and
<br>
opposed to every little thing, but there just aren't very many of them,
<br>
despite their vocal nature.
<br>
<p>Some of the most interesting aspects of postulated posthuman technological
<br>
development are the ways in which the world will become exactly like our
<br>
ancestors thought it was. There will be a spirit world, zombies, loa,
<br>
spirits of all shapes and sizes, gods, Gods, magic of influence and
<br>
transformation. It'll be an interesting race to see whether humanity creates
<br>
the new world in the image of its myths, or if the process remakes humanity
<br>
before this can happen.
