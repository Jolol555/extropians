<p>Actually, IQ tests vary radically in the scores they give out.  That's one
<br>
of the problems with them.  Mensa got around this problem by specifying that
<br>
one had to score above 99% of other applicants.  They have a table of which
<br>
IQ scores on which tests will qualify.  I believe the minimum acceptable
<br>
score ranged 30-40 IQ points depending on which test was taken.  Another
<br>
problem with IQ tests is that taking the same test repeatedly gives
<br>
radically different scores from day to day.  The tests don't even predict
<br>
future scores within a 10% error of margin.  If anyone wants to pass an IQ
<br>
test, just try again or try a different one.
