<p>
Nature has a review of &quot;Redesigning Life? The Worldwide Challenge
<br>
to Genetic Engineering&quot;, B. Tokar (ed.).  Zed Books (2001).
<br>
<p>The general tone of the review seems to suggest that the book is
<br>
a complete hack job trying to &quot;sell&quot; the positions of the authors.
<br>
Kind of along the lines of the &quot;radical-sell&quot; that Greg suggested
<br>
Rifkin's books are at Extro 5.
<br>
<p>Partial quotes (trying to stay within the copyright laws...):
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The approach of Tokar and his colleagues is illustrated by three items that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do appear in the book. One stems from a 1999 article in The Guardian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newspaper claiming that the British Diabetic Association had withheld
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence that thousands of diabetics may have suffered a deterioration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in health after using recombinant insulin. Although the association has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; categorically denied both the alleged evidence and its alleged cover-up,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the charge surfaces again here in a piece about &quot;a suppressed 1993 report
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commissioned by the British Diabetics [sic] Association&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Then a reference to potatoes with a lectin gene causing a furore in '98
<br>
citing Arpád Pusztai's 1999 Lancet paper that did *not* back up his claims
<br>
that they caused adverse effects on growth or the immune system (refs below).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Third, we read that &quot;a single intentional change in a plant's DNA can cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other, unintended health and safety problems&quot;. Yet the single citation here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to a 1996 New England Journal of Medicine paper about an allergen gene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from brazil nuts. The authors of the paper showed that this can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressed in soybeans, which provoked allergic reactions in people already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known to be allergic to brazil nuts. So what?
</em><br>
<p>I've read the abstract from that paper and cited it in my previous
<br>
review of the whole GM area.  It was good science funded by the
<br>
AgBio industry to determine whether allergens transfer across species
<br>
and the answer is yes so they are really careful to minimize the
<br>
allergenicity of genes that go into food crops.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The real purpose of that research was to investigate and then remove a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential hazard. Alas, Tokar and his colleagues do not seem interested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in these positive aspects of transgenic work. They do not even mention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most exciting potential of genetic manipulation regarding allergy --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the possibility of eliminating potential allergens from foodstuffs and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus avoiding the misery, and worse, that they can cause.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Many references in Redesigning Life? are to newspapers and magazines,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reminding us of the role the media have played, particularly in fomenting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hysteria over GM foods.  That influence is examined crisply and perceptively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in &quot;A Grain of Truth: The Media, the Public, and Biotechnology (Rowman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &amp; Littlefield, 2001) by Susanna Hornig Priest, a professor of journalism in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; United States. It should be read carefully by all who believe that the media
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get everything wrong, that journalists exercise excessive power over a gullible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public or that they are too preoccupied with either doom or hype.
</em><br>
<p>And then of course my new hero is Italian television producer of the science
<br>
prime-time show &quot;Superquark&quot; who is getting sued by homeopathists for his
<br>
'dissing of their profession.
<br>
<p>Angela says:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Science is not like philosophy, where viewers can listen to both sides
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and decide for themselves, science cannot be decided on by the vote
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of viewers.&quot;
