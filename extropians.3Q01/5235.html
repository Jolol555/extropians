<em>&gt;&gt; How can an incorrect theoretical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; construct be an inherent part
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of reality?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; You are getting hung up on words and concepts.. and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignoring the underlying reality those words represent.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Gravity&quot; is a word describing a theoretical construct. Other than that,
<br>
gravity is not at all observable. You seem to be casually postulating the
<br>
existence of a platonic ideal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are confusing the map and the territory.
</em><br>
<p>I think that applies more to your approach. The map is the word &quot;gravity&quot;;
<br>
the territory is a set of shared observations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Gravity&quot; may be a theoretical concept... but you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still wouldn't jump off of a 200 foot cliff, would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you?  Why not?  In that situation... suddenly it's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite so theoretical, is it?
</em><br>
<p>Falling under certain circumstances is observable, and reports from several
<br>
observers will confirm the observation. Then again, so is not falling under
<br>
certain circumstances. I was just in a huge metal thing up in the air that
<br>
somehow managed not to fall for hours a few days ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Again, they're all provisional theoretical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; constructs. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Constructs that describe reality to a greater or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lesser degree.
</em><br>
<p>The nature of that similarity relationship continues to evade philosophy.
<br>
There's no excuse for blurring the distinction between theory and
<br>
observation at the current state of understanding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fact that we don't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand what exactly gravity is in no way means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it doesn't exist.
</em><br>
<p>So you're asking me to believe in something that you can't describe or
<br>
explain, of which all known models are known to be false, based purely on
<br>
your say-so? Sounds a lot like religious faith to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Flashback to 1900:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;The ether simply IS -- it exists irrespective of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; your desires.&quot; That's how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; your statement will look in 2100.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I doubt it seriously.  There are no real world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences to believing or disbelieving in &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ether&quot;.  It made a handy explanation at a time when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such things couldn't be measured at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We CAN, however, measure the effects of gravity.
</em><br>
<p>They could measure the effects of the ether, too. The effects were called
<br>
&quot;light.&quot; Only thing is, the ether turned out not to be such a good
<br>
explanation, just as we know current ideas of gravity are not very good
<br>
explanations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whatever &quot;gravity&quot; is, it is real... and it affects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone and everything in very predictable, easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measured ways.
</em><br>
<p>Like God, you mean? You can't see it, can't explain it, but it pervades and
<br>
influences everything?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It doesn't matter what you believe...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; step off that two hundred foot cliff without a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parachute and you die, &quot;irrespective of your desires.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Not a true statement at all. There's a wide variety of ways you could not
<br>
die under the circumstances you describe.
<br>
<p>Obsolescence and partiality of theoretical constructs are among the biggest
<br>
problems for the philosophy formerly known as materialism, and now known as
<br>
scientific realism. A bigger problem is that no one has the faintest idea
<br>
any more of what a &quot;natural law&quot; is supposed to be in itself.
