Mike,
<br>
<p>I work in this industry (concealed weapons detection) and can give you an
<br>
answer.
<br>
<p>1. Nomenclature: While often referred to as magnetometers, its really an
<br>
&quot;electromangetometer&quot; if you will.  Conventional walk-thru portals use an
<br>
active AC (as in not DC) magnetic field generated by coils of copper wire on
<br>
each side.  A metal object in the field will generate &quot;eddy currents&quot; which
<br>
cause measureable voltage fluctuations in the copper wire coils.  This
<br>
process is different from a DC magnetic field which is the &quot;traditional&quot;
<br>
field people think of when they think &quot;magnet&quot; and uses a permanent physical
<br>
magnet.
<br>
<p>2. The physical size, orientation, and composition of the object all
<br>
contribute to its detectability in this process.  Obviously, theses
<br>
detectors are optimized to detect guns first, then knives. Actually, they
<br>
must only actually detect 3 specific models of guns and (currently) no
<br>
knives. (thank the FAA).
<br>
<p><p>The biggest problem with current metal detectors is that in order to detect
<br>
the smallest required gun on the FAA 3-gun test (a tiny .22LR revolver) its
<br>
so sensitive that it detects alot of other things, too.
<br>
<p><p>Its also possible to shield small objects so that their signal is below the
<br>
alarm threshold (like maybe a bone plate and some screws??) 
<br>
<p>I do agree completely, though, that US airport security blows.
<br>

<br>
<p><p>Mom went through a magnetometer the other day at the airport. She
<br>
happens to have a big titanium plate and screws in her arm. Did the
<br>
buzzer go off? Nope. Puzzled, she told the security person about the
<br>
plate and asked why the detector didn't detect this large metal object
<br>
in her body. The security person said &quot;Just move along.&quot;
<br>
<p>Its rather obvious that titanium is not a magnetic metal, so it is
<br>
undetectable by a magnetometer. It's also obvious that it is a rather
<br>
useful material to use in the manufacture of weapons: knives, clubs,
<br>
even firearms.... and airport magnetometers cannot detect them.
<br>
<p>Think about this for a minute. This means that the only real means of
<br>
ensuring that passengers are not armed is to strip and cavity search
<br>
every airline passenger.
<br>
<p>Think about the implications: since it is therefore impossible to
<br>
prevent all passengers from being armed unless we choose to live in a
<br>
big brother police state, we MUST have armed people on every flight.
