<p>&lt;&lt; There was a lot of controversy about this book
<br>
&nbsp;either being racist itself or being about racism itself.  There was arguing
<br>
&nbsp;on both sides about whether it was really racist again the Japanese or
<br>
&nbsp;whether it was really truthful about Japanese being racist against
<br>
&nbsp;non-Japanese.  This argument occurred in real life about the book, and
<br>
&nbsp;within the book about the fictional case.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;(By the way, I loved this and almost anything written by Michael Crichton!) 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
Crichton is cool and very prolific. I wonder how he would treat subjects like 
<br>
what Kurzweil advocates? My guess is he would not endorse cryogenics or 
<br>
uplaoding till he was absolutely sure it was good for the species (determined 
<br>
by his own standards). Yes Japanese can be very racist, we nee look no 
<br>
further then how they have treated their Korean citizens, who are Japanese 
<br>
Nationals. They are always maligned as criminals-invariably. If we look at 
<br>
World War 2 and Unit 731-lets just say-NOT GOOD!  Crichton got it Wrong from 
<br>
a purely economic point of view, because Japan suffered a contnuous 
<br>
stagnation throughout the 1990's, while the US Economy Boomed! Of course, 
<br>
better to stagnate in Japan then rot in Uganda, but that's another story.
