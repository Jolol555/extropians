<p><em>&gt; Lee,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you going to deal with the remaining questions or continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practicing debate tricks?
</em><br>
<p>Honestly, I'm doing no such thing.  I just finished a post where
<br>
I tried to conscientiously attempt an answer to each of your
<br>
questions.  In fact, I had thought that you were ducking *my*
<br>
question about Minimal Guaranteed Income  :-)   but I'm sure
<br>
that this is just a misunderstanding.
<br>
<p>My question below was about what Barbara had written; first
<br>
someone said that starvation was the alternative to having
<br>
an GMI (Guaranteed Minimal Income)---or that's at least what
<br>
I honestly thought they said, and then Barbara pointed out
<br>
that starvation didn't actually occur, but malnutrition did,
<br>
e.g. tuberculosis.  I thought that maybe a lot more people
<br>
were suffering and dying from that than I thought; I always
<br>
stand to be corrected.
<br>
<p>Please be patient and re-ask any question that you think has
<br>
been overlooked; it could be a clerical error.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Usually undernourished people's immune systems shut down and they die of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; pneumonia, tuberculosis, or some other infectious disease. Tuberculosis is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; becoming quite a problem in Mexico lately and in certain poor areas of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; U.S.A.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Have any idea how many people each year die from tuberculosis?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Once they're past the toddler stage, children tend to be fairly robust and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; can survive on a very poor diet, although they may suffer from various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; learning disabilities and other mental and emotional disorders. I know from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; personal observation that some children have only the free breakfast and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; lunch provided by schools, occasionally supplemented by what they're able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; steal from stores or scrounge from dumpsters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, &quot;malnutrition&quot; doesn't have the rhetorical advantages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of &quot;starvation!&quot;.  But evidently it's a lot closer to the mark.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (You've been providing some pretty good info... sorry for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pressing my luck:)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Have any idea of how many children in the U.S. are severely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; malnourished.  Yes, I'm sure that government programs help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out a lot in the sense that many children get their nutrition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from programs.  But we must remember that many of these children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would be fed by their parents, if their parents didn't freely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have a government program to take advantage of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We must also not overlook the fact that the U.S. government was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; paying about 20 billion dollars a year to young women to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; children out of wedlock in the sixties, seventies, and eighties.
