</em><br>
<p>Yes, Leonardo is a good example (and to my delight I see that the silly
<br>
domain lawsuit has been dropped now). But I still have a nagging
<br>
suspicion that it is mainly read by the people already interested in
<br>
combining art and science; what is its &quot;impact factor&quot; on the art
<br>
community/communities in general? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;The renaissance involved trying to create something new that unified the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;old knowledge with the new scientific/economic/artistic discoveries, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;then change society accordingly (although this later part only really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;got underway during the enlightenment). I see many similarities with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;today: we need a new renaissance to unify the old knowledge with the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;discoveries and then find ways of changing our societies accordingly. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the new Enlightenment (transhumanity) which Greg presented about at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extro-5, Max wrote about in Exponent, and I presented at Extro-2.  
</em><br>
<p>Sure, I am merely reiterating the same concept. But I think it needs to
<br>
be restated again and again among ourselves, so that more of us actually
<br>
go out and create this Enlightenment. While there are many stellar
<br>
examples of both renaissance persons and people actively promoting the
<br>
new enlightenment among us, there should be far more people doing it!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The best way to &quot;infiltrate&quot; the environments which you are referring to is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be there.  It is not a game plan, it is a presence.  Ideas permeate best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the comfort zone level where people do not feel pressured.  Going into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an environment and pushing an agenda is usually met with a counter force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Going in an introducing an agenda through persuasive credibility and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collaborative spirit is usually met with a welcome.
</em><br>
<p>This is true. Often people are intrigued by unusual fresh new ideas, and
<br>
if they can be shown to mesh not just with the local cultural context
<br>
but with other locally unexplored but important fields, they acquire an
<br>
even higher relevance. It is easier for the trader bringing exotic
<br>
goods, news and a good story than the invader with a battering ram to
<br>
get into the memetic castle of people. 
<br>
<p>That is why I have noticed many transhumanists who are active in
<br>
spreading transhumanism are refraining quite deliberately from
<br>
mentioning transhumanism unless asked. Sugegsting that these ideas are
<br>
part of a big system often creates a counterforce.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Art today is not what it was in the Renaissance.  In fact, most people do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not recognize or realize what art is today.  It is the understanding and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptance of what the symbol of  today's technology presents in regards to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture and what those of use who are transhumanists and other futurists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually think about.  The art that reflects this may not be plentiful, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is art nonetheless.  The art that reflects this may not look  or fell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like art of the past, but it is art nonetheless.  the art that reflects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this may not even be available to critique because it is still being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceptualized, but it is art nonetheless.  The art that reflects this may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be so ordinary that we don't even consider it art, but it is art
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonetheless.  One of my most favored pieces of sculpture today is the Seti
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Telescope.  Some of the most interesting art today is done digitally and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exhibited on the Internet, or in the think-tanks of scientific laboratories.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We cannot view art by the museum's standards or the standards of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mundane critic who is looking under rocks with a flashlight for new art.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If so, we might as well get on the stagecoach and head back across the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rockies.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. But the problem is of course that so many of today's
<br>
intellectuals and people involved in art are not looking for this new
<br>
art or appreciating it when they see it. The fact that there are people
<br>
who get it doesn't mean that the &quot;art of technology&quot; is widely
<br>
appreciated, of that appreciation of it can spread easily. This is also
<br>
an aspect we have to remedy. Any thoughts on the best inroads into
<br>
culture in this respect?
