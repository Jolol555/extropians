<p>Outrageous CEO Pay

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics of executive pay demonstrate their lack

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of understanding of economics with their attacks 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on high compensation. (08/21/01)

[Posted August 21, 2001] 
<br>
Nothing sharpens the sight like envy.
<br>
<p>Some legislators who are enjoying six-figure remunerations and seven-figure
<br>
benefits are dismayed about CEO compensation. They resent the fact that top
<br>
executives are earning multimillion-dollar-pay packages while lawmakers
<br>
subsist on such meager fare. CEOs, in their judgment, are greedy executives
<br>
who thrive on corporate profits when times are good and when times are bad. 
<br>
<p>Similarly, media commentators and journalists never tire of pointing at
<br>
apparent excesses of executive compensation practices. One business magazine
<br>
recently lamented especially about Apple Corporation's issue of a
<br>
stock-option package valued at more than $500 million, calling it &quot;The Great
<br>
CEO Pay Heist.&quot;
<br>
CEO compensation usually is pay-for-performance, consisting of a base pay
<br>
plus equity-based incentives such as bonuses, stock options, and other
<br>
equity vehicles. CEO income, therefore, rises and falls with performance.
<br>
The market way to measure his or her performance is by the size of company
<br>
profits and the price of the company stock. Numerous stockholders
<br>
continually judge the efficiency and profitability of a corporation and set
<br>
stock prices by buying and selling shares. They love and acclaim a CEO who
<br>
improves the profitability of their company and thereby may add millions of
<br>
dollars to the value of the company. They offer multimillion-dollar
<br>
incentives to management so that it may identify with the interests of the
<br>
owners.
<br>
<p>Irate critics of high CEO pay often base their charges on the notion that
<br>
corporate boards of directors and compensation consultants who make such
<br>
astonishing recommendations are cozy and &quot;cushy&quot; with management. Cronyism,
<br>
critics charge, is a strong and habitual business inclination to promote the
<br>
interests of one another. We may agree that cronyism is a human constant,
<br>
and not just in business, but it may also conflict with the interests of the
<br>
cronies. In fact, U.S. corporations probably are the most
<br>
shareholder-responsive in the world because the shareholders themselves may
<br>
be judged by the price of the corporate stock.
<br>
<p>The U.S. stock market is driven by powerful institutional investors such as
<br>
mutuals and pension funds that force management to maximize shareholder
<br>
returns and profits. Institutional investors have assumed the role that
<br>
wealthy families used to play before the age of confiscatory estate
<br>
taxation; that is, they have the financial clout and resolve to unseat
<br>
managements of poorly performing companies. For example, they replaced the
<br>
heads of IBM, General Motors, Kmart, and American Express with new talent.
<br>
They may also force CEOs to restructure corporate operations and trim their
<br>
payrolls to the bone-a tactic that was unheard of and unthinkable in the
<br>
past.
<br>
Institutional investors are forcing management to search for the best
<br>
possible combination of capital and labor-in other words, achieve the
<br>
optimum investment of capital with the optimum number of workers assuring
<br>
the most profitable operation. To employ fewer workers than the optimum is
<br>
to fail to utilize fully the capital equipment; to employ more is to reduce
<br>
labor productivity and raise costs. In short, if the number of workers is
<br>
too small, company profitability will demand the hiring of more workers; if
<br>
the number of workers is too large, profitability will require that excess
<br>
labor be discharged.
<br>
<p>Giant corporations consist of numerous company divisions, departments,
<br>
branches, and affiliates. Some are more profitable than others. Some may
<br>
even suffer losses and rely on the earnings and subsidies of the profitable
<br>
branches. An alert CEO is quick to recognize the situation-to reorganize the
<br>
loss-inflicting activity or to terminate it. He does not permit some
<br>
departments to inflict losses on the owners. To tolerate such failures would
<br>
soon lead to his dismissal or early retirement.
<br>
CEOs may reap unearned windfalls when the Federal Reserve engages in
<br>
inflationary policies that drive up stock prices. They may pocket undeserved
<br>
bonuses and exercise stock options that the Fed made profitable. Throughout
<br>
the 1990s, the Fed managed to create the greatest and longest economic boom
<br>
in American history, which drove stock prices to unprecedented heights and
<br>
some executives' pay to astonishing levels. Even mediocre CEOs could reap
<br>
unearned option profits, as the boom boosted company profits and raised
<br>
stock prices.
<br>
<p>When boom conditions finally turn into economic recession, however, CEO
<br>
income falls as company profits may turn into losses and stock options lose
<br>
their value. During boom periods, option profits may rise to 80 or 90
<br>
percent of CEO compensation. During recessions these profits tend to vanish.
<br>
Companies may then readjust management options to make up for the fall in
<br>
stock prices. The companies have no choice but to create incentives in good
<br>
times, and especially when times are bad. Capable CEOs may choose to work
<br>
somewhere else if their options are hopelessly out of money.
<br>
<p>Executive stock options impose no costs to the company; they are not paid
<br>
out of earnings. But they grant ownership to management, which dilutes the
<br>
ownership of all other stockholders. It dilutes the earnings and book value
<br>
per share whenever the stock options are exercised. Profit and loss
<br>
statements usually reveal the &quot;fully diluted earnings per share,&quot; if and
<br>
when the options claim 3 percent or more of company earnings. But
<br>
stockholders rarely complain, because the options granted become valuable
<br>
only when stock prices rise to the exercise price, which benefits not only
<br>
the option owners but also the stockholders. 
<br>
<p>Options aim to keep CEO eyes on company growth and share prices-which, in
<br>
this age of political correctness, is no easy task. Powerful political and
<br>
social forces continually demand the attention of management. There are
<br>
environmentalists, civil rightists, racists, protectionists, tax collectors,
<br>
and-last but not least-labor unionists who lay claim to company earnings.
<br>
Million-dollar stock options fostering individual self-interest constitute a
<br>
powerful defense against all special interests, yet many managements fall
<br>
prey to militant demands.
<br>
<p>The extraordinary height of some executive compensation reflects not only
<br>
the stockholders' attempt to overcome the countervailing forces, but also
<br>
some institutional obstacles to corporate takeovers and management
<br>
competition. Until well into the 1980s, corporations that were led astray by
<br>
political pressures-and consequently languished in growth and
<br>
earnings-became the favorite targets of takeover entrepreneurs.
<br>
<p>But, during the early 1990s, many corporations succeeded in practically
<br>
closing this avenue of corporate control by adopting poison pills and other
<br>
antitakeover defenses. Their primary aim was the preservation of the firm's
<br>
current managers' jobs and income regardless of their performance in leading
<br>
the corporation.
<br>
<p>The defensive tactics now include &quot;greenmail,&quot; &quot;poison pills,&quot; and &quot;golden
<br>
parachutes.&quot; Greenmail is the premium payment to a raider trying to take
<br>
over a company. By accepting the payment, the raider agrees not to buy any
<br>
more shares or pursue the takeover any further. Poison pills are various
<br>
management moves to make a stock less attractive to an acquirer. For
<br>
instance, it may allow all existing stockholders to buy additional shares at
<br>
a bargain price after a takeover. Golden parachutes are lucrative employment
<br>
contracts to provide lavish benefits in case of company takeover resulting
<br>
in the loss of a job. They may include generous severance pay, stock
<br>
options, or huge bonuses. All such measures raise the costs of an
<br>
acquisition and cause dilution, which, hopefully, will deter a takeover bid
<br>
and keep the newcomers out.
<br>
Resuscitation of the takeover market would not lower executive pay
<br>
overnight, but it would expose all compensation packages to the fresh air of
<br>
market competition. It would surely redress the imbalance of power and
<br>
compensation, although it is unlikely that it would appease the social
<br>
critics and concerned politicians. They resent most what they envy most.
