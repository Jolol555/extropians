I went to a public school.  For the most part I was bored
<br>
utterly senseless when I wasn't busy avoiding the local petty
<br>
tyrants both juvenile and adult.  Even the few classes I really
<br>
liked were geared to nearly the slowest students.  The deepest
<br>
lessons learned were patience, that most human beings are quite
<br>
often amazingly unkind and brutish,  and the most unfortunate
<br>
lesson that the fullness of one's intelligence is generally not
<br>
wanted and quite resented if it comes out.  
<br>
<p>Now, I might well have experienced most private schools as much
<br>
the same or worse.  But public schools are notorious for not
<br>
challenging and often not reaching the bright kids at all.  This
<br>
is a waste.
