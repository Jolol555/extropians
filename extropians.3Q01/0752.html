I've written Report #TL12A: Dinging and Dedinging
<br>
-- Subtle Suppression -- Self-Sabotage
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl12a.shtml">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl12a.shtml</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>Some extracts:
<br>
<p>DINGING IS LIKE A VERBAL SLAP IN THE FACE!
<br>
-- SOMETIMES BY AN INVISIBLE HAND!
<br>
<p>A few years ago I heard of businessman Kingsley Wimbush
<br>
who operated a company in California. He and his personnel
<br>
apparently became phenomenally successful, partly because
<br>
of his recognition of &quot;dinging.&quot; Many of us, most days, experience
<br>
all kinds of little disappointments, verbal putdowns, negative
<br>
self-talk, and the general negative effects of Slavespeak. These
<br>
negative incidents constitute dinging. I suspect that some people
<br>
allow themselves to be gradually &quot;dragged down&quot; by dinging in
<br>
a cumulative manner...
<br>
<p>&quot;Dedinging&quot; is a procedure whereby, every day, we recover from
<br>
all that day's dinging incidents... I suspect it's one of the greatest
<br>
&quot;increasers of personal power.&quot;
<br>
<p>...A great deal of dinging can occur on Internet mailing lists and
<br>
forums. Suppose you're a subscriber of &quot;List X.&quot; You consider
<br>
most of the other subscribers to be educated and intelligent.
<br>
Some of the long-time subscribers form a kind of &quot;insider clan&quot;
<br>
or &quot;in-group.&quot; You're not part of the in-group. You post something
<br>
you think important and of interest to the list. Your post is ignored
<br>
or ridiculed. Some members of the in-group seem to take turns
<br>
to come up with &quot;clever&quot; ways to ding you. For example, you could
<br>
post a message about this report. The only responses you get
<br>
are snide or sarcastic comments, while the essence of your post
<br>
is ignored. The list may have a &quot;dinging culture&quot; with a significant
<br>
portion of the posts including some dinging -- or a great deal of
<br>
dinging.
<br>
<p>On the back cover of 'Metaphors We Live By' by George Lakoff and
<br>
Mark Johnson: Take the conceptual metaphor ARGUMENT IS WAR.
<br>
We say: &quot;He attacked every weak point in my argument:; &quot;Your
<br>
claims are indefensible&quot;; &quot;I demolished his argument.&quot; But as the
<br>
authors write, &quot;It is important that to see that we don't just talk about
<br>
arguments in terms of war. We can actually win or lose arguments.
<br>
We see the person we are arguing with as an opponent. We attack
<br>
his positions and we defend our own... It is in this sense that the
<br>
ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor is one we live by in this culture; it
<br>
structures the actions we perform in arguing.&quot;
<br>
<p>*** End of extracts
<br>
<p>Maybe if we extropians become more mutually supportive and
<br>
gradually reduce our dinging, we'll become much more effective
<br>
at spreading our philosophy and ideas.

<em>&gt;&gt;I am sure there is a list out there for me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Congratulations to those of you who just chased another person off of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extropians list.  Perhaps, if you're lucky, we'll wind up with only a few 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dozen with exact same ideas on everything.  That would be wonderful, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wouldn't it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Frankly, I'm tired of seeing this happen.  True, it isn't often as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explicit as this case, but I have been privy to seeing plenty of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unsubscriptions after unnecessary verbal attacks.  And why is it...just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because someone has a few disagreements with one aspect of your worldview?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Personally, I have an opinion on virtually every thread on this list, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I try not to share those opinions unless I feel they add something to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussion as a whole --usually they do not.  Unfortunately, I don't have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a lot of workable ideas on changing the format of this list, or solutions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to out and out rudeness.  I will mention, like many before me however, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that I find such behavior juvenile, unwarranted and disgusting, and most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of all, unnecessary.  This isn't the kind of behavior that will win us 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;credibility on a public scale.  Please keep that in mind before you start 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;posting vehemence.
