<p>That is not so.  This is cultural relativism at its worse.  Many
<br>
of those who support this terrorism despise reason as the tool
<br>
of cultural imperalism.  They despise economic freedom and free
<br>
markets at the heart of capitalism as the great evil drawing
<br>
people away from the Truth of their faith.  We are attacked very
<br>
much largely as a giant and powerful negation of their set of
<br>
beliefs and their institution in governments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you just blindly wave the flag then you can just about guarantee it will

</em><br>
<p>It is not in the least blind.  It is a time to remember who we
<br>
are, what the difference between this kind of country and
<br>
government and the alternatives are and to act to defend that
<br>
which we, in all reason, believe is right.  It is also a time to
<br>
act strongly to stop such aggression on us.  How is that blind? 
<br>
It is not required to be perfect to fight for what is good in
<br>
your nation and in the world.  Do not disarm yourself in such a
<br>
way.  If you do then whoever is the most consistent in evil
<br>
wins.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  And that was foolish.  But it does not change at all what
<br>
must be done now.  And it matters very, very much why these
<br>
things were done and by what kind of political system.  War,
<br>
insurgency, counter-insurgency and such are a nasty business. 
<br>
No one would say otherwise.

I am going to stop talking for a while.
