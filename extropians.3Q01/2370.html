<p><em>&gt;What will you call it when Science corrects thinking which is erroneous,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;false, mistaken, delusional? How about &quot;cognitive therapy&quot;? Is the big
</em><br>
<em>&gt;picture of this Truth of Science, Absolute Truth?
</em><br>
<p>Science is simply the process (and I emphasise *process*) of rational 
<br>
inquiry into nature. It is not a body of Truth and the truths it discovers 
<br>
are always provisional. Okay, now a correction to the above: there is some 
<br>
rational inquiry into nature that is probably not meaningfully called 
<br>
&quot;science&quot;. The larger field of rational inquiry is called &quot;philosophy&quot;. When 
<br>
questions are refined to the point where it is possible to test hypothetical 
<br>
answer by precise mathematical modelling, by using instruments that allow 
<br>
for very close observation, and by the design of experimental apparatus that 
<br>
enable us to use hypothetico-deductive thinking at a very fine level, that 
<br>
is what we are inclined to call science. In this sense, science as currently 
<br>
understood is mainly a product of the 17th century, particularly beginning 
<br>
with Galileo and Kepler (though they had important precursors way back to 
<br>
classical times). Though some philosophers disagree (as Mark has pointed 
<br>
out), there is no sharp boundary between science and philosophy. Although 
<br>
the whole field of rational inquiry can be called &quot;philosophy&quot; we commonly 
<br>
use the word in a narrower sense to certain kinds of rational analysis of 
<br>
questions that cannot currently be tested effectively by the methods of 
<br>
science, or other more specialised methods that may operate in humanities 
<br>
disciplines such as literary criticism.
<br>
<p>It is possible to base religious beliefs on a process of rational inquiry, 
<br>
but they are usually based on tradition, childhood indoctrination, 
<br>
irrational experience, inspired guesswork in a state of ignorance of the 
<br>
world's functioning, etc. By and large, religious views are not provisional 
<br>
(though sophisticated religions do actually adapt to try to keep their 
<br>
doctrines consistent with well-established scientific theory).
<br>
<p>These are the basic differences between religion and the kinds of thinking 
<br>
that constitute rational inquiry (there are also specific humanistic forms 
<br>
of rational inquiry - again, there is no sharp boundary between these and 
<br>
philosophy. There is not necessarily a sharp boundary between them and 
<br>
science (eg, the sudy of history can use the scientific techniques I 
<br>
described above)).
<br>
<p>I can't speak for others on the list, but I object to my philosophical and 
<br>
other beliefs being called &quot;religious&quot;, because they are not based on the 
<br>
religious &quot;way of knowing&quot; (or, as I would say, of &quot;not knowing&quot; - I 
<br>
actually loathe the expression &quot;ways of knowing&quot;) as described above. To the 
<br>
extent that they *can* be (conceding that I can't be running around 
<br>
performing all the experiments, mastering the all the relevant maths, etc 
<br>
myself), my beliefs are based on the processes of rational inquiry and are 
<br>
open to change as they are exposed to further outcomes from those processes.
<br>
<p>I hope this puts the record straight on why I think there is no 
<br>
transhumanist &quot;religion&quot; and why there is probably no extropian &quot;religion&quot;. 
<br>
I say &quot;probably&quot; because I can't commit the extropes to all the above. I do 
<br>
think that someone who refers to him/herself as a &quot;transhumanist&quot; is saying 
<br>
that they take a *philosophical* position (if someone on this list calls him 
<br>
or herself a &quot;transhumanist&quot; but doesn't take this stance, I'll be very 
<br>
interested indeed).
<br>
<p>If extropians likewise say that their position is based on rational inquiry, 
<br>
then they should likewise accept the analysis above, or something very like 
<br>
it. They can then claim correctly (as people like Max More actually do) that 
<br>
extropianism is a sub-set of transhumanism, which is not a religion but a 
<br>
scientifically-informed philosophy.
<br>
<p>Ascend!
