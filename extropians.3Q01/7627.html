<em>&gt; This is incorrect.  A recent incident proved this.  A government official
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; hacker community to break it.  Someone did only a few weeks later.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turns out, that by using java technology (similar to what SETI is doing) one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hacker allowed millions of people to connect to his web site and lend him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their computing power.  In this way, a mere individual with just a PC was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to harness the computing power of millions of PC's for a few weeks, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did a brute-force crack of one of a PGP type code.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not familiar with this case, although it bears some similarity to
<br>
various incidents that I've heard of.  I don't know of a government
<br>
challenge to break a code which was broken a few weeks later.
<br>
<p>I do know of some cryptographic mechanisms which have been broken a
<br>
few weeks after publishing, sometimes publishing by the government, but
<br>
these were broken by analysis and not by brute force.  I know that some
<br>
challenges have been broken by brute force; for example the original RSA
<br>
challenge from Scientific American in 1977 was broken in 1994, and there
<br>
have been regular challenges since then which are also being attacked
<br>
in this way.  These challenges are all meant to be broken.
<br>
<p>I'm not familiar with the use of Java for this purpose, since Java
<br>
is relatively slow and it is hard to compete with C++ implementations
<br>
for heavy numerical work.  For almost any attack it would be far more
<br>
efficient to get people to run a C++ version of the engine, and in fact
<br>
that is how all of the brute force attacks have worked that I know of.
<br>
<p>I'd like to learn more about the incident you described if you are
<br>
confident that it happened that way.
