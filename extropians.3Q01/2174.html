n agree on money back if it doesn't start, or I can give you a three-year guaranty that it will work perfectly. This agreed-upon limited liability is the basis of the corporation. Another thing not to confuse, is the liability towards customers and the re
<br>
sponsability of the members (board/employees) toward the company (share holders). If a member acts out of line with company guidlines, he should of course be held responsible.
<br>
<p>That is my point: the individual is vested in the corporation, and may
<br>
delegate some authority to the corporation within certain conditional
<br>
parameters. However, your decision to delegate should be based on a
<br>
rational evaluation of the trustability of the corporation. If you
<br>
invest knowing that the corporation is not worthy of trust, then you
<br>
are, in fact, responsible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States, on the other hand, can't be compared to corporations, cause they are based on mandatory membership and coersion. It's a fact that in almost all modern democracies, the majority of citizens did *not* vote for their current government. Seems that 
</em><br>
actually no society has the government it deserves.
<br>
<p>On the contrary, Felix. Failure to act to disapprove is a market signal
<br>
of acquiescence. If you don't think it's important enough to vote
<br>
against injustice, then you must approve of the unjust actions of the
<br>
state.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, another philosophical justification for corporations: Any entity capable of intelligent action and self support should have the right to become first class citizens. Having a body shouldn't be a requirement - or you'd have problems as an upload. Nor
</em><br>
&nbsp;the ability to take physical punishment - there are pain killers. Nor should it matter how that intelligence is achived - just ask any AI out there to testify.
<br>
<p>Unh Unh. So solly. A group entity has no right to be the equal of a
<br>
'citizen', because this gives the members of a group more power (i.e.
<br>
more than 'one man one vote') than non-group-members. States are not
<br>
people, they are merely servant automatons, agents if you will, of
<br>
actual beings that are citizens of the state. This is inherent in the
<br>
principle that the state is only delegated some rights of the
<br>
individual, not all. Without all rights, it is not an individual, and
<br>
some entity cannot claim individuality by fraction rights derivation
<br>
from other individuals. Because derived entities are always agents for
<br>
individuals, giving the derived entity status as an individual causes a
<br>
violation of 'equal protection'.
