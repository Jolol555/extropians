<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact that so many journos and other writers find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any view other than the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above almost inconceivable suggests that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably common in the wider 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community.
</em><br>
<p>Could it be that, because these authors and writers
<br>
speak in this manner (which seems to coincide with
<br>
most religious, nationalistic, and some pop-sci
<br>
views),
<br>
and that public opinion is so easily swayed by this
<br>
sort of backhanded advertising, that the source is in
<br>
the publishing industry? If the newspaper is very
<br>
right-wing, like the Denver Post used to be (and
<br>
probably still is, I don't read the paper anymore),
<br>
whatever controlling entities would likely not allow
<br>
antiaging articles unless they were againt it.
<br>
<p>For the record, I took a journalism class once when I
<br>
thought it was a wholesome and truthful vehicle. I
<br>
dropped it within a week because the teacher published
<br>
some articles on &quot;local ghosts&quot; that were all
<br>
invented. He admitted it to the class and said we
<br>
would all become entertainers, not reporters of the
<br>
truth. It would be our jobs, he said, to entertain.
<br>
The truth was nonexistent to him.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think a lot of work needs to be done, getting out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the viewpoint that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radical life extension would be a good thing - the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same sort of work as many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of us are putting into defending stem cell research,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therapeutic cloning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.
</em><br>
<p>And several people have pointed out what we have to
<br>
fight--entrenched religions (domineering, patriarchal
<br>
and violent), entrenched pop-sci stuff that says we
<br>
are wasting money and should put it toward researching
<br>
new ways to keep our suburban grass from growing so
<br>
fast so we don't have to cut it as often, and mass
<br>
media that has enough power to determine our next
<br>
President.
<br>
<p>I would fight it all if I knew how. If we can figure
<br>
it out, you've got my pledge to help.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know whether this list can really coordinate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such work. I doubt it.
</em><br>
<p>But &quot;the list&quot; is not all there is--there are others
<br>
who have not gotten into a good search engine and
<br>
looked for &quot;antiaging research&quot; or &quot;Procaine
<br>
Hydrochloride&quot; or whatever. It's how I found you all.
<br>
<p>There are others who want to live, I know it, and want
<br>
to step beyond the supposed everlasting life of a god
<br>
that appears to love gold and money more than he loves
<br>
us. Maybe these peole have given up, I don't know.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If a strong 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and seemingly reasonable message is getting out in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numerous local forums, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and in wider forums whenever one of us has the clout
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be heard there, this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must have a gradual effect in countering the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-life-extension.
</em><br>
<p>These things are true. But, are there local chapters
<br>
of Extropians? Are there other orgnizations like it?
<br>
If so, do they compete too much (a house divided and
<br>
all that)? Do you have a printed newsletter (my
<br>
graphic arts background is clamoring to be heard)? Do
<br>
we have anyone pestering drug companies and the
<br>
government besides Pearson and Shaw? I truly don't
<br>
know, and am not asking just to make a point or two.
