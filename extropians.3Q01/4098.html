<p>Yes, *that* aspect of my philosophy is very un-extropian.  OTOH, I am
<br>
a signed up cryonicist who very much favors virtually almost all forms
<br>
of biological experimentation. So I guess there is some overlap but
<br>
not a total overlap.  I subscribe to this list b/c there are very few
<br>
lists whose participants in the main want a chance to live forever. I
<br>
subscribe to all such lists. This is one...

<em>&gt;&gt; Ultimately, we need to take back control of our lands and our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; repective First World govt's. The citizenry rightfully own and
</em><br>
control
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; these lands.  In the end, it will only get worse unless we have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; bunch of leaders, and take back control of our govts. I suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; technology as a means of control.  Instrumentation and monitoring is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; what we need. Cameras, etc.... Also, massive constitutional
</em><br>
amendments
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in the USA, and similar measures in Europe.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It seems to me that more free immigration, rather than more
</em><br>
restrictions on
<br>
<em>&gt;the movement of people, is consistent with the Extropian Principles.
</em><br>
<p>I am in favor of those things that favor me, Randy, getting a shot at
<br>
living forever. One of those things that does not, IMO, favor me,
<br>
Randy, living forever, is the importation of a whole butt-load of
<br>
superstitious, uneducated third world peasants into my country, who
<br>
will subsequently have an average of 6 kids, all of whose minds said
<br>
peasants will fill with copies of the same superstitious nonsense that
<br>
fills their own brains.  They will *probably* turn my country into a
<br>
copy of their own, purposefully or otherwise.  You may say that such a
<br>
course would not be in their own favor, but why would you apply such
<br>
logic? Such matters are hardly controllable.  
<br>
<p>All the while, I am in the LN2 filled dewar. What would be my chances
<br>
of ever emerging from the dewar, were such dewar in a world filled
<br>
only with third world countries?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Extropians see people as a positive thing, and are intent on &quot;growing
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;pie&quot; of over-all wealth, rather than trying to make state-enforced
</em><br>
rules
<br>
<em>&gt;that exclude participation in it.
</em><br>
<p>Extropianism has some great ideas, and some poor ideas. See above....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;While I'm at it, may I inquire how intentional your nom de plume is?  
</em><br>
<p>Completely. Tiberius Gracchus was a populist. He in a sense
<br>
acknowledged that Rome belonged to the citizen-soldiers who created
<br>
it/defended it/carved it out, etc..
<br>
<p>&nbsp;And he sought to pay dividends to those owners.  
<br>
<p>I claim that this country belongs to its citizens, and that there
<br>
exist benefits deriving from citizenship (such as the right to work
<br>
here) belonging to the citizens solely.
