<em>&gt; As I said, this is NOT what happened. NO VOTES CHANGED. Get it yet?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nobody's ballots changed who they were voting for, so therefore no votes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changed. Nor did any ballots leave the control of the election system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All work done to add the proper voter ID numbers to ballots was done on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premises.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I get it.  No votes changed.
<br>
<p>Do you get my point?  Votes that were not counted were modified so that they
<br>
were later counted.  The total number of votes for Bush was increased.  The
<br>
voting envelopes were modified by someone other than the submitting voter.
<br>
This breaks the law that voting materials cannot be modified after they are
<br>
submitted.  The materials were changed by the Republican party and not by
<br>
election officials.  This also breaks the law.
<br>
<p>Although the Republicans are technically correct when they say &quot;no votes
<br>
changed&quot;, they broke the law to change the total number of votes.  They
<br>
reapplied the votes that the voters intended to cast and ignored the fact
<br>
that these votes were technically illegal and legally should not have been
<br>
counted.  This sounds exactly like what the Democrats were doing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is incorrect. Both GOP and Democrat registered ballots were printed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without voter ID numbers, and they were 'real ballots'. Moreover, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Democrats did correct some democrat votes, but gave up and decided to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead insist all ballots without ID numbers be rejected.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, but I stand by my version.  This occurred less than 100 miles from my
<br>
house.  There were local court cases about it.  Only Republican ballots were
<br>
corrected.  Only Republican ballots were printed incorrectly.  Only
<br>
Republican volunteers were involved in modifying these absentee ballots.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a recount does not change the result of an election, then whether the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; winner wins by 1 million or just 1,000 ballots is irrelevant.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  But why did Harris change only the recounts that helped Bush (but
<br>
did not change the winner) and refuse to change recounts that helped Gore
<br>
(but did not change the winner)?  I was not arguing that it would have
<br>
changed the outcome.  I was countering your claim that the Republicans did
<br>
not change their counting methods just to suit their own needs.  In fact,
<br>
both Republicans and Democrats did.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the Democrats paid for the protesters BEFORE the election started,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicating they were planning on trying to steal the election by riot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before it even happened, then any counter-action to set things to right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is perfectly justified. Who initiated the violence? It was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Democrats. Its who initiates it that counts.
</em><br>
<p>Please, this is getting ridiculous.  I am not arguing that one side is
<br>
better.  They both played the same sort of games.  You seem to be admitting
<br>
that both sides did this, but you think the Democrats planned this all along
<br>
because they are cheaters, while the Republicans are only responding in kind
<br>
because they are fair.
<br>
<p>This seems to be a bit of a stretch.  Both sides pulled the same sort of
<br>
tricks.  Why not agree that they both are despicable?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've heard nothing about this. All I've heard is that some felons who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had had their felonies expunged or gotten petitions of relief from civil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disability granted wound up being wiped from the rolls when they should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not have, which included one felon who sat on an election board.
</em><br>
<p>It was worse than that, Mike.  We had whole towns left out of voting, which
<br>
happened to be black, because of computer errors.  We had three black
<br>
colleges in Orlando have all their black students turned away at the polls
<br>
due to the errors.  They had a voter registration drive and bussed all the
<br>
students to the polls.  Not one was allowed to vote.  The problem with
<br>
blacks being denied votes in Florida was a huge problem.  It has been
<br>
belittled and ignored by the newspapers, because their numbers were so small
<br>
compared to the Palm Beach problems and the recount problems.  We even had
<br>
one black women legislator denied the right to vote.  She spoke on CNN and
<br>
said that her voting record showed her to be a convicted felon and she was
<br>
turned away until they found out she was a congresswoman.
<br>
<p>In summary, I am not saying the Democrats were superior, although it may
<br>
seem that way since I am countering your arguments that Republicans were
<br>
superior.  I think both sides played dirty tricks because they perceived the
<br>
other side of playing dirty tricks.  Both sides were despicable as far as I
<br>
can tell.  I'm not sure there is much point into continuing to argue whether
<br>
one side was worse, or if they were both bad.  I do think you are a little
<br>
myopic when you think all cheating was done by Democrats, and all
<br>
controversial moves by Republicans were justified.
