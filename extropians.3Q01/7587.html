</em><br>
<p>Natasha, I read your posting with the same disbelief that I had when first 
<br>
hearing about the 9/11 attack, and the same dismay when it sank in.  I 
<br>
anticipate that you will be flooded with email and calls of well-deserved 
<br>
support, concern, and love.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I can't be certain, but it seems possible that pushing my lower body 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;aggressively. Because it was bleeding more, I could see clearly see it in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my urine.  Not all cancerous tumors show themselves, but grow in secret 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That's great.  I'm delighted by the recent developments in home testing and 
<br>
automatic monitoring technologies.  I can't wait until we can all routinely 
<br>
monitor key health metrics.  (I'd like to see a thread on this:  what can 
<br>
you monitor easily now, and what's worth doing?  I might not want the 
<br>
Japanese analyzing toilet but I think I'd get a watch that monitored your 
<br>
EKG and warned if you were on the brink of a heart attack.)  So many 
<br>
problems (in life overall, not just in medicine) are trivial if you detect 
<br>
and deal with them right away and become increasingly severe if you don't.
<br>
<p>That segues to the time management thread:  one key issue in assessing what 
<br>
to do on your to-do list is to understand what will happen if you ignore an 
<br>
item.  Will it stay the same, get better or disappear by itself, or will it 
<br>
get worse?
<br>
<p>Natasha's situation and recent squabbling on exi-freedom have reminded me 
<br>
of something I was going to post right after EXTRO-5.  One of you asked me 
<br>
who my friends were in the extropian community.  It struck me as a bizarre 
<br>
question.  There are those of you who I have met or exchanged private 
<br>
email, who I hit it off with, who might call me 'friend'.  But you're all 
<br>
my friends, my family.
<br>
<p>Yes, I (you) have other friends, other family.  But there are significant 
<br>
unifying bonds between us, and we need to hang together.  So often we see 
<br>
fractious factionalizing and fractionating in small groups.  Look at how 
<br>
often behavior in the libertarian and cryonics communities devolve into the 
<br>
People's Front of Judea vs. The Judean People's Front.
<br>
<p>Consider Natasha, Gina, Keith, and Sasha, to name just a few.  Or the 
<br>
private assistance that paid for several people to go to EXTRO-5.  I'd like 
<br>
to see more organized methods for getting help to people who need it.  In 
<br>
science fiction fandom, there are funds to pay for bringing people over to 
<br>
cons.  Actors, SF writers, folk singers, and police have similar mechanisms 
<br>
to provide financial assistance to their colleagues who have fallen on hard 
<br>
times.
<br>
<p>I'd be happy to investigate how other groups do this and to work with 
<br>
someone at EXI (Shaun?  Greg?) to help set up an equivalent for us if 
<br>
people like the idea.  (I think it should be run through EXI, since it's 
<br>
already an IRS-approved non-profit.)
