Mike, I do not believe that the IMF and the World Bank -- or the G8 --
<br>
are interested in giving third world countries _any_ opportunity to get
<br>
out of the mess they're in. Doesn't matter whether they try to borrow
<br>
their way out, nationalize their way out, or work like maniacs; the
<br>
whole idea that there _is_ a way out is the problem. Because the system
<br>
works better for the rich nations if there is _no_ way out.
<br>
<p>Healthy wealthy countries that have bootstrapped themselves out of 
<br>
poverty aren't viewed as trading partners, but as competitors. And that's
<br>
the heart of the problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thirdly -- and this is the most important point -- conditions attached to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; productively.
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Fiji.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Social welfare programs include building schools and training workers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in new skills. (What was that you said about &quot;unskilled, unemployable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and unwilling to fix that&quot;?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Education isn't social welfare, public education is simply monopolism.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
That's bollocks, Mike. And it isn't true, either. Education is useful to
<br>
individuals whatever the source, and educated individuals tend to benefit
<br>
the society they live in by virtue of their enhanced ability to work. In
<br>
a poverty-stricken country, people simply can't afford to pay for their
<br>
children to receive a private education; therefore the model of the state
<br>
paying for it seems to be the only viable one -- at least _somebody_ is
<br>
paying for it. But state funded education is treated as social welfare
<br>
by the IMF and world bank ...
