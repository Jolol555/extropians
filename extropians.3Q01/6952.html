</em><br>
<p>This is maybe not as serious a problem as you make it. I think most of
<br>
us here on the list understand that we would extend the concept of
<br>
sancticity of human life to other parts of mindkind when they appear -
<br>
AIs, trans- and posthumans, alife beings, uplifted animals, aliens etc.
<br>
The reason we talk about human dignity, human life, human this and that
<br>
is simply tradition: humans have been the only example of intelligent
<br>
beings with moral subjecthood up until now. When the other kinds appear,
<br>
we will have to extend the definition of &quot;human&quot; in these ethical
<br>
matters to the other thinking entities (or even better, do the
<br>
philosophical footwork before it happens; some parts of the animal
<br>
rights debate actually deals with nonhuman rights in a way that might be
<br>
interesting to us, even if we might or might not accept the claims for
<br>
other currently extant species). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's almost a kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vitalism; there's some special 'essence' that gives humans worth but we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no definition of what it is.  The one definition (or reason, excuse) we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often do accept I find naive: the idea that by fostering a culture that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as its prime value the absolute sanctity of human life I increase my chances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of survival.
</em><br>
<p>There are plenty of definitions of what makes humans worth something in
<br>
philosophy, of varying compatibility with transhumanism. Again, I refer
<br>
to the June human dignity discussion. The practical idea that sancticity
<br>
of human lives promotes safer societies is IMHO quite valid.
<br>
<p>But I think transhumanism really needs a clearer image of what it means
<br>
to be human in order to speak clearly about its ethics. I have some
<br>
ideas for this, but I would love to hear the rest of the list express
<br>
what they think constitutes the important part of being human (in the
<br>
extended sense to include all the trans/post/nonhumans of ethical
<br>
interest). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  This embodies the second part of current (apparent) Extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought that I find irksome: this &quot;black box&quot; view of the human mind as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something almost non-physical, indivisable (for want of a better word), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of a kind of omniscient decision making tempered only by input.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see it on this list all the time; from the idea that we can drop books on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peoples heads and they'll immediately become rational thinkers to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defence of individualism and the primacy of survival as self-evident.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are attacking two different things here. The first is simply
<br>
the idea that by informing people they become rational and nice. This is
<br>
clearly not true, as evidenced by the number of third world dictators
<br>
that went to western universities. On the other hand, people are also
<br>
affected by input - ideas matter. It is just that the situation is not
<br>
either-or.
<br>
<p>The second thing is the simplistic view of human thinking that has been
<br>
prevalent in philosophy for a long time. One could call it the divorce
<br>
of psychology from philosophy. I agree that this is a big problem,
<br>
although it is not local to extropian thought or especially severe here.
<br>
It is everywhere in academia. Fortunately we might be able to deal with
<br>
it due to advances in neurospychology, the postmodern dissection of the
<br>
self and - hopefully - a transhumanist synthesis of this into a new
<br>
concept of the mind. But it is hard work reaching there.
