<em>&gt;&gt; Also, I know that the temptation to sarcasm is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; strong---especially when one feels outnumbered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not certain what you mean by feeling outnumbered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Outnumbered because of my politics?  Certainly not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outnumbered when it comes to some other criteria.
</em><br>
<p>I was just projecting.  This list has a history of being dominated
<br>
by libertarians, and sometimes I've noticed people resorting to
<br>
sarcasm not out of a justifiable cleverness, nor to be funny, but
<br>
to consisely answer a lot of challenges.  Their emotions also show
<br>
through.  I say this because I was on a socialist dominated list
<br>
a few years back, and it was tempting to get pretty sarcastic because
<br>
I felt that I didn't have enough time to explain lots of silly 
<br>
challenges.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; In a society of millions, or hundreds of millions, some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people's economic worth to others will be vastly more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; than other's economic worth.  Should school teachers be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; paid more than movie stars?  Who is to say?  The answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is not [to let] some committee force their decision on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; others, but [to let] people freely choose with their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; dollar-votes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But which committee decides the worth of those dollar-votes?
</em><br>
<p>Ahem, I'm not getting the idea across.  Choosing with
<br>
'dollar-votes' is libertarian-speak for free choice
<br>
made through purchasing power.  Similar to &quot;vote
<br>
with their feet&quot; in the case of deciding which is
<br>
preferable, East Germany or West Germany.
<br>
<p>No committee decides that movie stars are paid more
<br>
than teachers; people's individual preferences show
<br>
by which group or which individuals are able to
<br>
convince others to pay them at some rate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Yes, sometimes the differences are obscene.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So are you saying, &quot;so what?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I'm saying that just because Spielberg
<br>
makes fifty million dollars a year, and some
<br>
teacher makes twenty thousand, there is no
<br>
need for some committee to decide how much
<br>
Mr. Spielberg &quot;is really entitled to&quot; and
<br>
to transfer (by force, not persuasion) some
<br>
portion of his income to teachers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm only glad the libertarians weren't in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;charge&quot; during the Civil Rights Movement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The differences, obscene as they are now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have been even more so.  Where would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we be now - still living in a segregated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society?
</em><br>
<p>My guess is that offensive racist behavior would have
<br>
mostly faded by now---it was already on its way out 
<br>
when government decided to use force.  Soon, starting
<br>
with the most educated people, pre-judging someone
<br>
based only on their race would seem stupid in the south,
<br>
just as it had already started to seem stupid in the
<br>
north.  My opinion is that most whites would in that
<br>
case still view blacks as underdogs, and thus be willing
<br>
to be pretty sympathetic, just as underdogs always a
<br>
favorite.  But for this change to happen naturally would
<br>
take several generations, and revolutionaries are never
<br>
content with that.  (In 1913 or so, a British ambassador
<br>
in Moscow told a revolutionary that the changes desired
<br>
would be developing in a few decades at the rate that the
<br>
Czarist government was liberalizing.  &quot;But we can't wait
<br>
decades!&quot;, came the retort.  As a result, they may have
<br>
to wait centuries.)
<br>
<p>But we'd be without the arrogance of whites &quot;granting&quot;
<br>
them rights, favoring them because they had to (by law),
<br>
making it impossible for a black to tell whether he got
<br>
an important job on his own merits, or whether it was
<br>
merely the result of affirmative action, and so on.
<br>
<p>Thomas Sowell documents in excruciating detail the horrible
<br>
results of affirmative action:  black students that would
<br>
have been very competant at a typical UC school (where I
<br>
went) got drafted into the very best classes at MIT and
<br>
Cal Tech, and got creamed.  Then the second tier of
<br>
black students was placed, over their heads, in schools
<br>
such as mine, and got humiliated again (even though they
<br>
studied very hard).  And finally, this evil process
<br>
denuded the lower colleges of the worthy black students
<br>
who should have been attending (but were shuffled into
<br>
higher ones), in order to guarantee failure at all levels.
<br>
Such things happen when we follow government edicts instead
<br>
of evolutionary processes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Switching to the utterly mundane, thanks for correcting my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;obcene&quot; typo, Lee ... I hate it when I do that.
</em><br>
<p>You're very welcome.  If I want my posts to be read, then
<br>
I want them readable.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Not all people think or feel as you do.  Why should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; they be literally forced to yield up their money?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point is - &quot;some of my hard-earned money&quot; - not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;money,&quot; period.  Shucks, I believe in contributing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to some &quot;general good.&quot;   After all, I use &quot;free&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources - as I said before, my children went to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public schools...
</em><br>
<p>Well, I feel charitable on many occasions too.  But
<br>
it looked like you didn't answer my question. Why
<br>
should people who aren't feeling generous at the 
<br>
moment (or perhaps any other time) be compelled to
<br>
support programs that they don't want to?  Who knows
<br>
better than they how to spend their money?  Who knows
<br>
what they need it for or want it for?
<br>
<p>If the government didn't end up taking half (!) my
<br>
money, I would indeed be vastly more charitable.  Now,
<br>
we think of it as &quot;the government's&quot; responsibility,
<br>
and it was a big mistake for it to have ever come to
<br>
this.
