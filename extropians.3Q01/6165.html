<p>
Well, as of now, what we &quot;suspect&quot;:
<br>
<p>- 2-3 terrorists per plane
<br>
- knives and/or bomb threats were used to gain control
<br>
- possible involvement of ground personnel in smuggling weapons
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;onto the planes (meaning perhaps 50 people involved).
<br>
- the plane transponders and possibly black boxes were
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;disabled by pulling the circuit breakers  [its for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sure now every future hijacking will do this now that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;its been published all over the news]
<br>
- possible training of the terrorist pilots by either
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. flight schools or advanced flight simulators
<br>
- reasonable probability of ties to Bin Laden
<br>
<p>Solutions:
<br>
- train airline crew in defensive tactics
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(presumably makes them more expensive)
<br>
- adding &quot;Sky Marshals&quot; to the flights
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(also expensive)
<br>
- equip them with defensive weapons (tasers) or offensive weapons
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(guns) [which have negative use consequences in flight]
<br>
- transparency to the ground for what is occurring in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cabin (requires high bandwidth and personnel to monitor)
<br>
- computer-aided-ignoring of excessive deviations from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the flight plan (but what about the recent Alaska Airlines
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;flight where they lost control of flight control surfaces --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;can computers deal with such situations?  If not and the default
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mode is to return control to the pilot, then hijackings could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;be enabled by engineering a reversible loss of control).
<br>
<p>I might add:
<br>
- automated external detection and cross-agency notifcation of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;any deviation from flight plan
<br>
<p>Of note:
<br>
- Airlines have reported that with the anticitpated fall
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;off in traffic they expect that they may not have enough
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cash to survive the next month.
<br>
<p>Questions:
<br>
- If they only had knives, why didn't multiple passengers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;rush&quot; the terrorists?
<br>
- Now that we have seen what can happen -- will a plane full
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of Americans allow it to happen again?
<br>
- Skyscrapers are constructed to withstand plane impacts.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can they be constructed to withstand a plane full of fuel
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;setting them on fire?
<br>
- Why didn't the Pentagon (or less likely, the World Trade
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Center buildings) have individuals on the roofs equipped with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;surface-to-air missles?  Given what these disasters will cost,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it would have been a small additional security expense.
<br>
- Where was the flight that crashed in Pennsylvania headed?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've heard speculations of the USX building, Camp David
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Pentagon.
<br>
<p>Doesn't look like anybody has attempted looking at solutions
<br>
looking at other terrorist acts.  How do you stop a &quot;go fast&quot;
<br>
boat headed for Miami with a nuclear or bioweapon?
<br>
