<br>
There's a big logical fallacy in your argument, though: which is the idea
<br>
that a country can operate with nobody working. At least, it's a fallacy
<br>
today -- I really hope Hans Moravec's vision of robots everywhere has
<br>
something to it.
<br>
<p>The thing is, an individual good does not necessarily scale to being a
<br>
public good if you give it out to everyone. If the entire population of
<br>
Japan retired, who the hell would be running the nursing homes? Wiping
<br>
bottoms and cooking dinner? Keeping the power stations running? In
<br>
practice, what an ageing recession means is that there are fewer warm
<br>
bodies available to look after the old folks. (That leads, among other
<br>
things, to wage inflation without corresponding GPD growth -- Not Good
<br>
if you're one of the pensioners living off your investments.)
<br>
<p>Now, we can pick holes in this argument until the cows come home; for
<br>
example, if all the Japanese pensioners move to Manilla they'll have lots
<br>
of alienated labour to spend their dividends on. Or they could import
<br>
labour via, let's say, waldos teleoperated by minimum-wage workers in
<br>
Slovakia. (Thus neatly avoiding the &quot;guest worker&quot; problem and maintaining
<br>
a Japan that is 100% pensioned off but nevertheless functional.) But still,
<br>
there's a problem to argue over.
<br>
<p>I figure the core problem is: what context do economic events occur
<br>
within? Some people maintain that the market is Everything. An orthdox
<br>
communist will probably maintain that the market is Nothing, and class
<br>
is everything.  Being a wishy-washy old-fashioned British liberal, I
<br>
maintain that the market is a very large object that does useful things
<br>
most of the time, but it's not the be-all and end-all of human society,
<br>
and there are higher goods than greasing the wheels of the machine at
<br>
every opportunity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And yes, I want to live forever, too, but I have come to the conclusion that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the conventional wisdom that a &quot;healthy economy&quot; has little bearing on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chances of developing long life medicine.  WHy should the two be connected?
</em><br>
<p>Well, that issue is entirely orthogonal to the previous one under
<br>
discussion.  (And I agree with your conclusion, incidentally.) But if you
<br>
want to discuss it, I suggest we change the subject line ...
