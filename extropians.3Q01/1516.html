<p>Chris, I agree with you that a fairly robust shield could very well be
<br>
20 years or more away.  Furthermore it may be made obsolete
<br>
by some technology, such as a Singularity.  But it might not.
<br>
<p>Regarding the billions to deploy a partially effective system, most
<br>
of that money has already been spent.  The research and development
<br>
of *current* EKV, THAAD and PAC3 has already been spent.
<br>
Building a few thousands of these and parking them somewhere is
<br>
the cheap part.  I dont see why not go ahead and do it.
<br>
<p>John Clark has repeatedly claimed that SDI is chasing rainbows, and
<br>
there is some possibility this is true.  I think not, but consider that there
<br>
is a race going on.  If we do not defeat nukes, they will eventually
<br>
defeat us.  All our pleasant dreams of nanotech, AI, cryonics, etc,
<br>
could be nuked back into the stone age, unless we defeat the nukes
<br>
first. MAD wont keep us safe forever, we need to press on.  spike
