<p>Swarming planes
<br>
<p>The sky's the limit for aircraft controlled by a shared intelligence. By 
<br>
Duncan Graham-Rowe 
<br>
<p>SOFTWARE that allows planes to &quot;swarm&quot; could eliminate mid-air collisions 
<br>
regardless of how crowded the airspace is, say its French creators. Rather 
<br>
than slavishly sticking to air corridors dictated by air traffic control, 
<br>
pilots would choose their own flight path after takeoff, cutting journey 
<br>
times. 
<br>
<p>&quot;In a free flight situation, this sort of swarming software is absolutely 
<br>
necessary,&quot; says developer Géraud Granger at CENA, the Center for Aerial 
<br>
Navigation Studies in Toulouse. CENA's system has already been tested on a 
<br>
simulator using archived data on real air traffic, and it successfully 
<br>
prevented a pile-up with 35 planes sharing airspace. 
<br>
<p>FACES (Free flight Autonomous and Coordinated Embarked Solver) only advises 
<br>
pilots to make manoeuvres when absolutely necessary. This &quot;distributed 
<br>
software&quot; means that no particular plane is ever in command, so they make 
<br>
their avoidance manoeuvres together.
<br>
<p>When pilots are confronted with one potential collision, says Granger, the 
<br>
challenge is to give them instructions for evasive manoeuvres without causing 
<br>
another. 
<br>
<p>To do this, each plane calculates a new heading one at a time, its software 
<br>
taking into account only the planes that have already planned their new 
<br>
course. This way, the first plane simply stays on its course, while the last 
<br>
plane in the sequence will have to plan its new path around all the other 
<br>
planes in its 35-kilometre detection zone. Once the manoeuvres have all been 
<br>
planned, the planes inform their pilots of their new course and the 
<br>
choreographed manoeuvres are carried out. 
<br>
<p>The advantage of CENA's distributed - or leaderless - approach is that you 
<br>
don't need a human controller or additional airport infrastructure to make it 
<br>
work. Granger says the software can be embedded in existing flight management 
<br>
systems.
