[Michael Lorrey quoting &quot;Fire Safety Regulation in Northeastern Santiago,
<br>
Chile&quot; by
<br>
John M. Cobin at: <a href="http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume3/v3i1a2s1.html">http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume3/v3i1a2s1.html</a> ]
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This paper extends my previous study of fire safety regulation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Baltimore by presenting similar evidence from northeastern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Santiago. Like the dramatic increase in Baltimore through 1994,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; structural fires per capita in northeastern Santiago have soared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 8.9 times since regulation began in 1929 despite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;      massive increases in building safety regulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a faulty premise. Under fire safety regulations, imposed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goverment fiat or insurance requirements,
</em><br>
<p>I think there's a big difference between the two -- between &quot;government
<br>
fiat&quot; and &quot;insurance requirements.&quot;  The latter is voluntary, the former
<br>
mandatory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; one SHOULD expect an inrease
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the number of fires per capita. Decreasing the incidence of fires is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NOT the goal of fire safety regs. The purpose is to reduce the overall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damage and death toll of each individual fire.
</em><br>
<p>But Cobin does go over just this point in the third section of the essay
<br>
(<a href="http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume3/v3i1a2s3.html">http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume3/v3i1a2s3.html</a>) when discussing Santiago's
<br>
building code:  &quot;The legislation was designed to establish compulsory
<br>
construction norms for minimum and maximum building height and the selection
<br>
of building materials, plus a means to retard the propagation of fires...&quot;
<br>
This code was put into place in 1929, &quot;after a disastrous earthquake struck
<br>
Talca [another Chilean city] in 1928...&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Without fire safety regs, large dense cities frequently had a huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devastating fire every few years or decades. One fire would cause untold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deaths and the loss of thousands of homes and businesses. Today, each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual fire that occurs is generally contained within its building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or within a small part of a building due to the required use of fire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retardant matnerials, and deaths would be minor due to required
</em><br>
<em>&gt; installation of fire safety equipment (like extinguishers, fire escapes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smoke alarms, and public education).
</em><br>
<p>I would hazard to guess -- but confess ignorance here:) -- that, in the
<br>
past, most fires, too were small and contained.  It wasn't like London
<br>
burned done once a decade.  You make it sound as if it did.
<br>
<p>What we would need to do is find out if government fire codes have had the
<br>
impact you believe they have.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
