<p>No one knows.  There are many problems that make this a bad bet.  Most
<br>
reactors were designed long ago when aircraft were smaller.  Most of the
<br>
concern was for an accident, not a plot where the biggest possible bomb was
<br>
flown directly into the weakest possible link.  I have seen nothing about a
<br>
plant's ability to resist the impact of a second hit, after the impact and
<br>
fire of the first has had time to reduce the structural strength of the
<br>
reinforcing bar, and powder the concrete.
<br>
<p>Resistance in this case is theoretical.  A whole calss of problems we have had
<br>
with the industry happen because the physicists present safety based on
<br>
theory, but the engineers design what can be done the real world, and the
<br>
construction companies take &quot;little&quot; short cuts they think will not matter,
<br>
and the workers do what workers do when the boss is not looking.  Then, the
<br>
plant runs for 20 years during which normal deterioration happens, and the
<br>
operators fix only some of it.
<br>
<p>However, the biggest problem I see is the storage of spent fuel in big pools
<br>
outside the containment.  The plants were not designed to hold their waste
<br>
forever, but that is what has happened because we have not solved this
<br>
problem.  So the containment could be 100% safe around the reactor vessel for
<br>
a single aircraft impact, but when the waste pools go up it is going to be a
<br>
very bad day.
<br>
<p>I think we have some serious exposure, here, and were very lucky the bad guys
<br>
did not pick this kind of target.
