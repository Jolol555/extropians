<p>Yeah. Despite my present appearance (being a bit overweight), back in
<br>
the days when I was a ski instructor, I had something of the 'sex
<br>
object' experience, which was fun but rather shallow. Imagine hanging
<br>
out with other beautiful people who assume you are as stupid as they
<br>
are.... you may not get bored visually, but your brain is still saying
<br>
&quot;Please shoot me&quot;....
