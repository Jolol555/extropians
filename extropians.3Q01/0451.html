<br>
<p>If everybody were good and above-board, I don't think anybody would
<br>
worry
<br>
about a transparent society.  In a world free from secrets, crime and
<br>
corruption, honesty and transparency would be great.  However, we do not
<br>
live in that world.
<br>
<p>People who hold government clearances may not want foreign governments
<br>
monitoring them.
<br>
<p>People who go to gay bars may not want their identities reported to
<br>
prejudiced people with baseball bats.
<br>
<p>People who are carrying money may not want that fact broadcasted to
<br>
thugs
<br>
walking on the street.
<br>
<p>People who question authority may not want the authorities notified.
<br>
<p>People who go to abortion clinics may not want their identities sent to
<br>
their church.
<br>
<p>People who have sexually transmitted diseases or mental diseases may not
<br>
want their conditions revealed.
<br>
<p>People who have sex or go to the bathroom may not want other people
<br>
watching
<br>
them during the act.
<br>
<p>Performers, artists, writers and engineers may not want their work
<br>
published
<br>
until they are finished creating, testing and editing it.
<br>
<p>Until we abolish wars, prejudice, crime, opposing religious and
<br>
political
<br>
factions, and embarrassment, we will always have secrecy and a desire
<br>
for
<br>
privacy.
<br>
<p>On a logical level, Lee makes and excellent case that hiding from the
<br>
world
<br>
is not the answer.  Gays shouldn't have to hide from gay-bashers.  Rich
<br>
people should feel safe to walk the streets without being assaulted.
<br>
Governments should be prevented from interfering with their citizens'
<br>
lives.
<br>
National security should come from a position of strength and defense
<br>
rather
<br>
than security by obscurity.
<br>
<p>However, I'm not sure that we will ever reach that level.  Mike feels
<br>
safe
<br>
because he has a gun.  I feel safe because my computers have firewalls,
<br>
IDS,
<br>
encryption and anti-virus.  Eliezer feels safe because AIs are
<br>
programmed to
<br>
be friendly.  Will we ever be so safe that we drop our guards?  Or will
<br>
we
<br>
always need to keep our safety protocols in place to maintain the safety
<br>
that we desire?  I am betting on the latter.
