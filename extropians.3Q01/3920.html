<p>The real problem with Microsoft is that their e-mailer automatically runs
<br>
software some anonymous person sent you in e-mail without asking.  All these
<br>
viruses could easily stopped if Microsoft would just pop up a window and
<br>
say, &quot;Unknown person just sent you an unsolicited program that wants to make
<br>
unknown modifications to your PC.  Do you want to run this program?  [Yes]
<br>
[No]&quot;  But Microsoft doesn't want to do this because many of their programs,
<br>
such as Microsoft Project, use these remote-control programs to make updates
<br>
on different PCs from a central location without bothering to include any
<br>
security to make sure the instructions come from a trusted source.
<br>
<p>I agree with Cringely that virtually all viruses and worms on the Internet
<br>
are specifically Microsoft backdoor viruses.  Holes in Linux and other
<br>
operating systems are closed when they are discovered.  Only Microsoft
<br>
insists on keeping these holes open.  I use their products, but I don't know
<br>
why they don't apply a little security to them.  It is not that difficult to
<br>
do.
<br>
<p>I disagree with Cringely that allowing access to raw sockets is dangerous.
<br>
All this means is that networking software is easier to write under Windows.
<br>
Instead of limiting network access to secret system calls that only
<br>
Microsoft engineers know, they are now allowing other software vendors to
<br>
write networking code for Windows.  This will allow new network software to
<br>
be written.  Some of this software may be in the form of viruses or worms.
<br>
<p>Saying that this is dangerous is like saying making PCs easier and faster is
<br>
dangerous, because hackers would then have easier and faster tools.  This
<br>
enhancement to the Windows Operating system is a generic improvement to make
<br>
networking programming easier.    This is almost a Luddite position.  He
<br>
seems to say that improving network access will help hackers more than
<br>
nonhackers.  Windows become the &quot;perfect little virus machines&quot; merely
<br>
because they are becoming easier to program.  We already have this ease of
<br>
network programming on Macintosh, OS/2, Linux and other Operating Systems.
<br>
Only Microsoft had previously tried to block programmers from accessing
<br>
their own PCs.  We haven't seen those other platforms becoming hacker
<br>
favorites.
<br>
<p>I predict that Microsoft e-mail backdoors will remain the most commonly used
<br>
attack vector.  There is nothing really new in Microsoft XP that hackers
<br>
don't already have if they wanted.
<br>
<p>As for the universal ID idea, we already have this.  Virtually every user of
<br>
the Internet connects to their ISP with a username and password.  ISPs keep
<br>
records of all user activity for planning and billing purposes.  This system
<br>
is already in place.  Hackers may be able to work around this system or any
<br>
new system of identification.  Cringely's scheme for the future doesn't
<br>
really change anything.  The same is true for his plans to restrict access
<br>
to the network.  We already have Zone Alarm and other personal firewalls.
<br>
Besides any hacker that we are trying to restrict could hack their own
<br>
machine's security to get access to their own hardware.
<br>
<p>Cringely's call for new protocols, APIs, interfaces and the like are silly.
<br>
We already have all these things available now.  He is not proposing
<br>
anything new.
