<em>&gt; Wrong. If the statistics say that, say, 10% of blacks commit crime while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only 1% of whites do, then it is a reasonable assumption to say that any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual black person is ten times more likely to commit crime than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any white person, all other factors being equal.
</em><br>
<p>This is just plain wrong.  Any freshman course on statistics will teach that
<br>
this is wrong.  I am white.  Do I have 1% chance of committing a crime?
<br>
Charles Manson was white.  So was Hitler.  Do they all have the same chance
<br>
of committing a crime?  We cannot deduce anything about any individual based
<br>
on their race.  All whites added together might add up to a 1% crime rate,
<br>
but you have no information about the percent chance of any individual
<br>
committing a crime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any given coin flip DOES have a 50-50 chance of being heads or tails.
</em><br>
<p>If you really want to predict a single coin flip, you would have to say that
<br>
it's chances of being heads (or alternatively tails) would be 50% with an
<br>
error of plus or minus 50%.  That is from 0 to 100%.  There is no
<br>
information here about any individual coin toss.  If it's heads, was the
<br>
statistics right?  If it's tails, was the statistics right?  Can anything
<br>
happen with one coin toss to affirm or refute the statistic?  No.  One coin
<br>
toss is totally unfalsifiable.  It cannot be tested.  There is no data.
<br>
There is no predictive information.  The outcome cannot be said to be
<br>
accurate or inaccurate.  The statistic cites has no connection with any
<br>
individual coin toss.  Even after the result of one coin toss is known, it
<br>
does not say anything about the statistics.
<br>
<p>Average statistical numbers are only applicable to large groups with a
<br>
bell-curve distribution and a random distribution.  Statistics are defined
<br>
as being invalid when applied to smaller groups, nonrandom groups, or
<br>
individuals.
<br>
<p>You cannot say that any individual black is more likely to commit a crime
<br>
than any individual white.  You do not have any information about these two
<br>
people.  One may be a serial killer while the other is a choir boy.  The
<br>
racial statistics above and their individual racial memberships are not
<br>
connected.  There is no predictive value for any specific individual.  This
<br>
is a common misunderstanding of statistics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Weather prediction is far more accurate the more you know about weather.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saying that clouds don't cause rain and that its wrong to accuse them of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causing rain, AND wrong to conduct scientific research to find out what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DOES cause rain is itself wrong. Saying it is racist to conclude from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific study that clouds cause rain is wrong and simply politically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct thinking.
</em><br>
<p>I would never say this.  My definition of racism does not depend on whether
<br>
I believe in it or not.  Something should be categorized objectively as
<br>
racist or not racist by whether it matches a defined criteria.  My
<br>
evaluation that racism is bad, or someone else's evaluation that racism is
<br>
good should not influence our objective categorization.
