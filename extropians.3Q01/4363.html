<em>&gt; Olga, we elect you as the disinterested organization.  Check out a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy at the local library and check it out.
</em><br>
<p>Good idea.  While you're at it, why doesn't she research UFOs to see if
<br>
they're real.  Also prove that the moon landings really occurred.  And try
<br>
to find out if Bush really won the Presidency fairly.  And, if she has time,
<br>
find out about that JFK shooting also.  And could she try to locate Elvis
<br>
while she's at it?  Also, proving whether God exists or not would be
<br>
helpful.  A whole proof or debunking of all psychic powers would be useful
<br>
as well.
<br>
<p>Seriously, Olga has already posted references to scientific responses to The
<br>
Bell Curve.  I have not seen any scientific reviews for it, just a bunch of
<br>
laymen saying &quot;it sounds good to me.&quot;  There seems to be a bad case of
<br>
&quot;prove it's wrong&quot; mentality here.  Instead of providing evidence for the
<br>
minority opinion, it is being presented as a default with a request to
<br>
disprove it.
<br>
<p>Lately, we have been accused of having &quot;blind faith&quot; in science by not
<br>
personally verifying scientific knowledge with our own research.  We have
<br>
been accused of being &quot;politically correct&quot; for not giving unscientific
<br>
viewpoints equal standing with scientific ones.  We have been accused of
<br>
&quot;refusing to debate&quot; for not debunking every crank theory that gets posted.
<br>
We have been accused of &quot;not proving our position&quot; if we don't personally
<br>
disprove every anti-science post that appears.  We have been accused of
<br>
&quot;appeal to authority&quot; for preferring scientist's conclusions to those of
<br>
mystics or politicians.  We have been accused of &quot;personal attacks&quot; for
<br>
reviewing an author's background and methodology.
<br>
<p>How should we respond to challenges to science or established facts?  How
<br>
much work should we undertake to argue the basics over and over again?
<br>
(This used to be against the list rules in former years.)  How much time
<br>
should we expend defending our basic position that science is real and all
<br>
scientists aren't part of a great liberal conspiracy of political
<br>
correctness?  Do we really need to examine unscientific organizations and
<br>
methods just in case they might have stumbled across some truth that science
<br>
missed?
<br>
<p>I have tried to respond rationally and scientifically to some of these
<br>
claims lately.  I am becoming discouraged that it is a waste of time and
<br>
leads nowhere.  If people do not understand the basic scientific,
<br>
experimental, and statistical methods, then further discussion rarely helps.
<br>
If people do not believe in these methods, the situation is even worse.
<br>
Time is a limiting factor here.  It is no wonder that most readers just skip
<br>
these arguments.  Should we just ignore these challenges as they appear?
<br>
Does that make them appear stronger or weaker than directly confronting
<br>
them?  Is there a danger of filling the Extropian archives with all sorts of
<br>
unscientific conspiracy theories that are posted as if they had all our
<br>
support?
<br>
<p>I would seriously love to hear some comment about this.
