<em>&gt; What do you mean by &quot;contravene&quot;?  He simply wrote papers and

</em><br>
<p>Actually, it is not quite so simple.  Dmitry Sklyarov works for a Russian
<br>
company called ElcomSoft Co. Ltd. of Moscow &lt;<a href="http://ElcomSoft.com">http://ElcomSoft.com</a>&gt;.  They
<br>
They sell commercial software that recovers passwords or breaks encryption
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://ElcomSoft.com/prs.html">http://ElcomSoft.com/prs.html</a>&gt;.  Their software is purportedly intended for
<br>
people who have lost their passwords, but could be used by anybody to break
<br>
into for which they never had a password.  They sell programs that can crack
<br>
into just about anything:  Compressed files, Microsoft Office products, AOL,
<br>
ICQ, Quicken, QuickBooks, Lotus products, Adobe products, Borland/Corel
<br>
products, Symantec products, etc.  They also sell password generators,
<br>
brute-force password crackers, and other tools that hackers often use to
<br>
break into other people's files.  Their site is written in English and gives
<br>
all prices in U.S. dollars.
<br>
<p>Their latest product is this program which breaks the encryption for Adobe
<br>
Systems Inc. PDF (Portable Document Format) files and e-books without having
<br>
the decryption key.  This cracking program was not just written as an
<br>
exercise or as a demo.  It was published as commercial software and is
<br>
offered for sale over the Internet &lt;<a href="http://elcomsoft.com/apdfpr.html">http://elcomsoft.com/apdfpr.html</a>&gt;.  They
<br>
even have a free demo version of the program available for download that
<br>
will let people crack any Adobe e-book for 30 days.
