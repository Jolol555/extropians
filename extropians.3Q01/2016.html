<em>&gt; Bullshit yourself, Samantha. I've specifically referenced the writer who

<p><p>Excuse me.  I was around for the initial exchange and the
<br>
specific article was never produced.  If it was produced it
<br>
would still be an assertion of a writer for one magainze quoting
<br>
an interview that we have no way of checking the veracity of
<br>
from another magazine.  I think any sane person would consider
<br>
that extremely thin evidence for claiming a person's primary
<br>
purpose in a long campaign for what they apparently believe in
<br>
is different from what they themselves are on record over and
<br>
over again regarding what motivates them.  To say that the
<br>
second-hand opinion of jornalists makes it a matter of fact that
<br>
Stallman is motivated as you claim is very thin at best.  To
<br>
baldly asserted it as simply truth is highly irresponsible.
