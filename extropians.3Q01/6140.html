<p>According to the White House and the Pentagon much earlier today, that
<br>
plane was not shot down by any military plane (the rumor claimed it was
<br>
an F-16).
<br>
<p>Camp David is not a generally unpopulated area, and I think that given
<br>
that we likely had no idea where that plane was heading, there was the
<br>
possibility that it could hit a location with far more people in it, so
<br>
eliminating that threat would be worth the less than 100 people aboard
<br>
whose lives were already most certainly forfeit.
