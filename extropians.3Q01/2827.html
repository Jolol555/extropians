Religious groups won't get this worked up over AI, right?
<br>
Good. Then forget cloning. Everyone into the AI lab!

Scientists outflanked and outgunned in cloning debate
<br>
By Toni Clarke
<br>
<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Scientists involved in cloning research are being
<br>
out-manoeuvred by well-funded religious and anti-abortion groups, and are
<br>
unlikely to prevent the United States from banning therapeutic cloning
<br>
unless they put their message across more forcefully, industry experts say.
<br>
<p>On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to outlaw human cloning
<br>
and to ban the cloning of embryos for the purposes of medical research in a
<br>
decision that, if confirmed by the U.S. Senate, could put the U.S.
<br>
biotechnology industry behind Britain and other countries that have less
<br>
restrictive policies.
<br>
<p>If proponents of therapeutic cloning are to be successful, lobbying groups
<br>
such as the Biotechnology Industry Organisation and the Pharmaceutical
<br>
Research and Manufacturers of America (Phrma) need to enter the debate more
<br>
aggressively, cloning research advocates say.
<br>
<p>&quot;We have a huge job to do in terms of educating the public,&quot; said Thomas
<br>
Tureen, a spokesman for Advanced Cell Technology Inc., a Worcester,
<br>
Massachusetts-based company that aims to clone cells to treat a variety of
<br>
diseases, from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's. &quot;If there is to be any salvation
<br>
out of this it will be that people will wake up to how little thought went
<br>
into this vote.&quot;
<br>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, reaffirmed on
<br>
Tuesday that he opposes cloning &quot;under virtually any circumstances&quot; and that
<br>
there are &quot;limits to what we can do morally with embryonic stem cell
<br>
research.&quot; That doesn't bode well for stem cell scientists.
<br>
<p>The goal of therapeutic cloning is to reprogram an adult's own cells to
<br>
create new ones that can replace those that are diseased or cannot
<br>
regenerate themselves.
<br>
<p>Under the proposed ban it would still be legal to pursue stem cell science
<br>
using cells from embryos discarded in in vitro fertilisation clinics. But
<br>
this will not allow patients to gain full benefit from research, according
<br>
to stem cell researchers.
<br>
<p>&quot;IVF tissue, while useful for research, will have limited application in
<br>
therapy because it is not an exact genetic match for any patient,&quot; Tureen
<br>
said. &quot;That's where the public is confused, I think.&quot;
<br>
<p>Scientists involved in cloning research are hindered in the public debate by
<br>
fears that a Frankenstein baby will be created if there are not stringent
<br>
controls.
<br>
<p>&quot;What the House has voted on, disappointingly, is to make the leap from an
<br>
embryonic stem cell to assume someone will go on to clone a human being,&quot;
<br>
said Jeff Swarz, a portfolio manager at Life Science Group, a Greenwich,
<br>
Connecticut-based asset management company that specialises in health-care
<br>
investments. &quot;That's a scientific leap that is far, far into the future.&quot;
<br>
<p>The biotechnology industry is also being outgunned in the corridors of
<br>
power. The Biotechnology Industry Organisation, for example, has just 10
<br>
people in its government relations department and stem cell research is just
<br>
one of dozens of issues they try to address, according to its spokesman,
<br>
Michael Werner. The lobbying group doesn't even pretend to have great
<br>
influence with lawmakers.
<br>
<p>He said the group, which represents about 1,000 companies, will &quot;continue to
<br>
testify and meet with members of Congress,&quot; but it will take a back seat to
<br>
organisations representing patients suffering from various diseases.
<br>
<p>&quot;The message will be carried by the patient groups,&quot; Werner said. &quot;They are
<br>
the ones who can put human faces on the debate and can describe the
<br>
health-care benefit, so they are the ideal folks to do it.&quot;
<br>
<p>The scientists' cause is getting no help from the big U.S. pharmaceutical
<br>
companies.
<br>
<p>&quot;The only position we take is that our members are not in the business of
<br>
cloning babies or cloning human beings and we are not going to do it,&quot; said
<br>
Jeffrey Trewhitt, a spokesman for Phrma, which represents the major drug
<br>
companies.
<br>
<p>With such meagre support behind them, companies such as Advanced Cell
<br>
Technology could be forced to abandon their research or move to another
<br>
country, analysts said.
<br>
<p>&quot;Any scientific arena that is stifled by politicians isn't good for the
<br>
scientific community and may not be good for the general public,&quot; Swarz
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>Still, not all companies agree that their voice hasn't been heard, or even
<br>
should be heard. David Greenwood, chief financial officer of Menlo Park,
<br>
California-based Geron Corp., said lawmakers are not short of the facts, and
<br>
deserve time to digest the information given to them during testimony.
<br>
<p>&quot;People are making up their minds based on religious or philosophical views
<br>
and it is not appropriate for us to try to influence people's thoughts in
<br>
that respect,&quot; Greenwood said. &quot;Nor will we attempt to influence public
<br>
opinion on the question.&quot;
<br>
<p>Geron, however, has little at stake. It already conducts its research in the
<br>
U.K., and the one U.S. researcher it had planned to collaborate with on
<br>
therapeutic cloning, Roger Pedersen from the University of California in San
<br>
Francisco, said last month that he would defect to take up a lecturing post
<br>
in England.
<br>
<p>Some still maintain, too, that U.S. politicians will eventually come to
<br>
favour therapeutic cloning as the public becomes aware of the medical
<br>
benefits.
<br>
<p>Swarz points to the furor that occurred two decades ago when recombinant DNA
<br>
research, or genetic engineering, was first introduced. Once the first
<br>
genetically engineered form of insulin was created, by Genentech Inc.,
<br>
opposition faded away.
<br>
<p>&quot;That was a huge breakthrough as people came to see the enormous benefit of
<br>
genetic engineering,&quot; Swarz said. &quot;I think the same thing will happen with
<br>
cloning.&quot;
<br>
<p>©¿©¬
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, and ego.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
