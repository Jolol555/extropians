<em>&gt; On the D.A.R.E. subject more generally, I yield to no one (except maybe

<p>Thanks for the accolade, but actually, I don't refer to myself as an atheist,
<br>
but rather as a non-theist, because it seems to me that belief is the problem,
<br>
not what is believed, and an atheist is one who believes that god (whatever
<br>
that means) does not exist. So, it's still a belief. As J. Krishnamurti used
<br>
to say, knowing truth (that which exists, that which ineffably abides) doesn't
<br>
require you to believe it, or even to understand it. But if you recognize,
<br>
acknowledge, and successfully interact with it, then you know it. IOW, seeing
<br>
accurately and correctly isn't believing, it's experiencing. This assumes we
<br>
can properly identify the experience of hallucination, especially drug induced
<br>
varieties.
<br>
(&quot;Are you experienced?&quot; --Jimi Hendrix)
<br>
<p>Of course some people say that experience is for people who can't learn any
<br>
other way. To which I reply, don't be satisfied learning about love and life
<br>
from a book.
<br>
<p>There's nothing like the real thing. Accept no substitutes.

<p>Stay hungry,

<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
