fairly applied. It might end up being a lot more than 40 acres.

<p><em>&gt;Hmm. That raises an interesting larger question about Libertarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that I hope somebody smarter than me can answer-- how would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transfer/sale/inheritance of stolen goods be handled in Libertopia?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Does it automatically revert to the original owner if they can prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that they are, or would 'posession is nine tenths' prevail?
</em><br>
Good question. There is much division about this. Some (eg Nozick and
<br>
Rothbard) argue that it should revert to the original owner or their
<br>
descendants/heirs - which implies most Americans should be paying rent to
<br>
Native Americans, Australians to Aboriginals. Others argue that the should
<br>
be a &quot;statute of limitations&quot; so that title should be acquired after a
<br>
certain period of unchallenged possession, even if the original acquisition
<br>
is unjust. This is the solution most jurisdictions use for land. The limit
<br>
varies - in Rome it was two years, in modern America it's ten (I think). In
<br>
England the traditional (and I think good) practice was to allow title if
<br>
the land/goods had been held &quot;from time out of mind&quot; ie beyong the memory of
<br>
the oldest person still alive. This has interesting implications for eg
<br>
Zimbabwe and South Africa where land was forcibly taken from the Africans
<br>
and given to white settlers, well within living memory in the Zimbabwe case,
<br>
just about in SA. Steve D
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, do Libertarians support inheritance of debt?
</em><br>
<p>Again a good question. This has a direct bearing on the debate about
<br>
reparations. If you hold that reparations are not due because no one now
<br>
alive is personally responsible, then you are saying that debt is not
<br>
heritable (among other things). In that case what about the National Debt ?
<br>
Logically you should not support taxing people now alive to pay for an
<br>
obligation incurred before they were born or were minors.
<br>
<p>My own position on that question BTW is that reparations are not justified
<br>
in principle but are defensible on prudential, or even Machievellian
<br>
grounds. Technology is relevant to all these questions because it can
<br>
profoundly affect what is possible/knowable. Steve D&gt;- --
