<em>&gt; That's what the Fred Reed piece did -- it relied on rational thought to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show the foolishness of the &quot;reparations&quot; silliness.
</em><br>
<p>My own view of &quot;reparations&quot; is that making me pay for the crimes 
<br>
of long-dead slave owners is no more rational than holding the 
<br>
descendents of the slaves responsible.  I have no more control 
<br>
over those events than they do.  This &quot;reparations silliness&quot; is 
<br>
much more than just silliness.  It vilifies modern day whites not 
<br>
for doing something wrong, but just for being the same race as 
<br>
someone who did something wrong.  And it gives preferential 
<br>
treatment to modern day blacks not for being oppressed, but just 
<br>
for being the same race as someone who was oppressed.  This, in 
<br>
itself, is a racially motivated injustice.
<br>
<p>I recognize that these are the same points that Mr. Reed was 
<br>
making in his article.  And I recognized when he was 
<br>
demonstrating the absurdity of &quot;guilt by association&quot; by 
<br>
reversing the roles.  But he played the role reversal so well 
<br>
that it left me with the uneasy feeling that the sarcasm might 
<br>
have been only a thin disguise for genuinely held views.  I don't 
<br>
know enough about Mr. Reed to know whether he is racist.  But the 
<br>
impression, even if accidental, is strong enough to be patently 
<br>
obvious to me even though I agree with his main argument.
<br>

<p>The future is ours to create.
