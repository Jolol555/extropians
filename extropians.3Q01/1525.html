<em>&gt; &gt;  That doesn't have to be the point of a population defense system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Stopping a single accidentally launched missile doesn't sound like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; frivolous goal.
</em><br>
<p>I argued that while not frivolous, it doesn't remove its value as a threat.
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey responded:
<br>
<em>&gt; Yes it does. Terrorist groups and the rogue nations that support them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operate on limited resources. All they get from an attack that fails so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miserably is a local rally of support from fellow extremists who only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect the fact that they tried an attack. They surely won't stick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around for round two, when we decide to strike back.
</em><br>
<p>I'll try again.  If they have twenty missiles and we have a 90%
<br>
effective system, they get two nuclear missiles through.  They didn't
<br>
intend to defeat us in a war, they intended to inflict heavy casualties.
<br>
&nbsp;They did so.  I don't think you would say &quot;we stopped most of their
<br>
missiles, so they failed miserably.&quot;  The point of having twenty
<br>
missiles wasn't to do twenty times the damage of a single missile, it
<br>
was to make it more likely that at least one would get through.  They
<br>
don't care about round two.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Chris, what makes you think even a country like Russia, which went broke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once before trying to outspend us, could possibly succeed at the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game?
</em><br>
<p>We aren't playing that game anymore.  The current game has several
<br>
players who have nuclear weapons and delivery systems, and no players
<br>
who have effective defensive systems.  One of the players announces that
<br>
it intends to start to develop and deploy defensive systems that will
<br>
start out not very effective against some currently possible attacks and
<br>
get better over time.  If any of the other players are worried about the
<br>
intentions of the player developing defenses, they can invest in more
<br>
and better offensive tools and stay ahead of the other player's
<br>
defenses.  They don't have to be able to win a war in order for it to be
<br>
valuable in some cases to be able to inflict losses.  
<br>
<p>There are many countries in the world that hate us or are afraid of us. 
<br>
I understand why you want to be safe from some missiles.  My claim is
<br>
that trying to get there gives some of the countries that are afraid of
<br>
us or that hate us a reason and an excuse for arming.  We can reduce
<br>
some threats, but making that move may increase others.  
<br>
<p>I think it's possible that the threats that will be reduced are unlikely
<br>
to be exercised (a suitcase nuke is easier than a single missile.)  I
<br>
think the threats that may be increased in response to our actions are
<br>
more worth avoiding.  I also think it's a lot of money that doesn't
<br>
benefit us.

<em>&gt; Regarding the billions to deploy a partially effective system, most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of that money has already been spent.  The research and development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of *current* EKV, THAAD and PAC3 has already been spent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Building a few thousands of these and parking them somewhere is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cheap part.  I dont see why not go ahead and do it.
</em><br>
<p>The money that's been spent is sunk costs.  It's water under the bridge.
<br>
&nbsp;How much do you think building a few thousand will cost?  How  much to
<br>
operate them over time?  How much to develop the next layer of systems? 
<br>
(I thought we had agreed that the current technology is not very
<br>
effective, and we have to continue to spend money in order to keep up
<br>
with the obvious counters to our first move.)
<br>
<p>Spike continued:
<br>
<em>&gt;  If we do not defeat nukes, they will eventually defeat us.
</em><br>
<p>Why do you believe this?  And what do you mean by &quot;defeat&quot;?  I thought
<br>
we were talking about a system that for the next twenty years will only
<br>
let a few nuclear missiles through.  If we don't deploy SDI, then worst
<br>
case, a few missiles hit us.  (Why would anyone invest to build more if
<br>
the first few are likely to get through?)   If we do deploy, then worst
<br>
case someone delivers a few suitcase nukes.  Or (their choice, not ours)
<br>
we get into a arms race and have to spend lots of money trying to defend
<br>
against more and more sophisticated missiles.  How did we benefit from
<br>
starting the race?
<br>
<p>I'm more willing to believe that most of the people that might decide to
<br>
join us in an arms race (if we start one) would also be willing to join
<br>
us in a world wide market for developing and delivering high tech toys. 
<br>
I'd rather be in a commercial race than an arms race.
<br>
