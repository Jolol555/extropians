<em>&gt; &gt; I seriously doubt this is a major reason behind the widespread use of

<em>&gt; fuzzy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terms like human dignity, integrity, autonomy and vulnerability in ethics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Integrity, autonomy, and vulnerability are definitely less fuzzy, to me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than dignity here.  See my last paragraph.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't necessarily think it's a major reason, but I think it can be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivating reason for some.  After all, the more fuzzy a term, the less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commitments one has to make, the less restrictions one has to put up with.
</em><br>
<p>And this lack of restrictions makes the concept much more of an all
<br>
purpouse bludgeon you can hit rhetorical opponents with, with little
<br>
fear of the opponent responding (this was why I got interested in human
<br>
dignity - by having a transhumanist perspective on the concept we can
<br>
now respond back, with the added advantage of actually having some
<br>
definition rather than just a good word). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not to be against scholarly study -- my mode of life anyhow:) -- but don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think that after X years of such, the fuzziness of the term will become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know. Some concepts become more and more usable as you use them
<br>
more, but they might not become crisper. Highschool physics students may
<br>
memorise a definition of energy, but practicing physicists are actually
<br>
less likely to remember how it is defined - but at the same time they
<br>
are very skilled at using the concept. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; That said, it is clear that the fuzziness of these termes does lend itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to being stretched/squeezed to fit political aims. But this might be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of politicals exploiting lack of understanding of the concepts in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; general public than a promotion of bendable concepts in academia. That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; promotion likely have other causes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed, though this still brings up the matter of whether the &quot;bendable&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept is better.  If it's more likely to be abused, then, all other things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being equal, it might not be so good.  Maybe all other things aren't equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the payoff is higher, but this remains to be proved, don't you think?
</em><br>
<p>I think bendability is likely a sign that it is a suitcase word or
<br>
otherwise not a good category; it might need a stricter definition or
<br>
better elucidation. But the bendability is as you show both a social and
<br>
inherent property, so a strictly defined concept may be culturally
<br>
highly bendable (rights) or a somewhat diffuse concept may be used in a
<br>
non-bendable manner (blueberry). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've always thought of integrity in two ways.  One is the more physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usage of the term.  A container has integrity when it's not been breached.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The other is more ethical.  A person has integrity when he or she practices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what he or she preaches.  This second form obviously doesn't meld with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first all that well.  They don't contradict.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. Maybe we should find different words for them. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I tend to think a general right to privacy would include something like your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept of integrity anyway.  After all, if we think of a private space, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally don't mean one that just others can't peek into, but also one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the world does not impinge on.  You know, one's private home is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought of as a place where one controls not only who can look in, but who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or what can disturb the interior or yard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not willing to go to the barricades over which term we use, but I fear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some might sneak in other things by using integrity instead of privacy here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This seems to be the case with dignity.  When people use that term it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean things like choosing who to marry or not to be harassed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government, but it can also mean things like the right to an education, job,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; healthcare, unemployment insurance, housing, culture, a certain living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard, and the like.  These can be smuggled into other concepts too.
</em><br>
<p>For this discussion, which at least started out in the Transparent
<br>
Society corner of the memesphere, it seems the introduction of integrity
<br>
instead of privacy would only confuse matters.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What might be smuggled into the idea of integrity here?
</em><br>
<p>One dangerous thing is that if the word integrity is used instead of
<br>
privacy, then the idea that privacy is intrinsically tied to inviolable
<br>
human rights might overshadow the practical and cultural compromises the
<br>
concept traditionally have. But this is a bit reverse to what I would
<br>
expect people to smuggle into the debate, it is more likely to try to
<br>
smuggle concepts into it that weakens the privacy concept instead.
