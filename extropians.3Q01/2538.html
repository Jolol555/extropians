<p>This doesn't apply only to racial or ethnic minorities, of course. Amazing
<br>
how many women owners you see these days in traditionally all-male
<br>
businesses such as highway construction. When statistics on female and
<br>
minority business ownership include sham owners you get a very misleading
<br>
picture of The Way Things Are. This allows politicians to say, &quot;See? Haven't
<br>
we done a great job of making up for past wrongs?' The psychological effect
<br>
on individual women and members of racial and ethnic minorities can work
<br>
both ways, I guess. On the one hand, reading of other members of minority
<br>
groups who have &quot;made it&quot; in business might give a person the courage to try
<br>
it for himself. On the other hand, it can be disastrous to make a business
<br>
plan based on a distorted view of reality.
<br>
<p>In one of Olga's recent posts she asked if anyone could come up with a
<br>
better way than affirmative action to deal with entrenched racial
<br>
discrimination where the disadvantaged group has been subject to unjust laws
<br>
in the past. This is a really tough question, particularly since prima facie
<br>
just laws are commonly enforced unjustly. As Olga pointed out, for example,
<br>
black males drivers are pulled over by cops more often than whites, stopped
<br>
when walking down the street and so forth. I don't have a better answer,
<br>
though I'm still thinking about it. Since racial prejudice is often overcome
<br>
when members of the two groups actually get to know each other (as Mike
<br>
Lorrey mentioned with respect to his military experience), laws that force,
<br>
or at least encourage, the mingling of racial and ethnic groups would seem
<br>
to be a good starting point. In my daughter's school, where the mix is
<br>
something like 60% hispanic, 30% white, and 10% black, the kids (at least
<br>
the ones my daughter hangs out with) don't seem to give any importance to
<br>
race in choosing their friends. Many of the kids come from mixed homes; in
<br>
some cases a kid might have the benefit of exposure to all 3 groups--for
<br>
example, a hispanic mother, a black father, and a white stepfather. Even in
<br>
this community, though, you're more likely to be arrested (and convicted) if
<br>
you're non-white, when, to the best of my knowledge, whites commit at least
<br>
as many crimes per 100 people as do non-whites.
