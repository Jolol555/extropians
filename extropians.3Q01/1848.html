<p><em>&gt; With respect to the existing situation in the U.S.A. I believe that a GMI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would probably be possible for no more than is currently spent on health,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education, and welfare benefits. As Damien said, it wouldn't be enough of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; income to provide a cushy lifestyle, but it would be enough to survive on,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly if laws were changed to allow people to build their own houses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and grow some of their own food.
</em><br>
<p>Richard Nixon actually proposed a negative income tax back in the 70's.
<br>
Since from an entirely practical point, giving all the money that is
<br>
spent by HEW back to the people who earned it is out of the question,
<br>
I'd join you in favoring that it simply be equally distributed to all
<br>
adults in the U.S.   (Of course, from an entirely practical point of
<br>
view that's out of the question too, because bureaucracies are build
<br>
on a need for power, and to support the jobs of innumerable bureaucrats.
<br>
But as a question to probe the values of all the intelligent people who
<br>
have been posting on this question---and I that I mean all the people
<br>
who've been posting :-)  ---I'm wonder if the other redistributivists
<br>
here would agree with us.  (Of course, they'd not find that amount of
<br>
money sufficient for what they think people *need*, but it'd still be
<br>
an interesting data point to see if they agree:  namely, to repeat,
<br>
to take all the HEW money, fire the bureaucrats, and equally distribute
<br>
all that money to adults, excluding, as you said, recent immigrants.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Maybe it would be best to wait until ... a number of compassionate rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people will simply fund a minimal standard of living for everyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This should occur as we approach the Singularity, and we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the onerous stealing from the rich to give to the poor (by force).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd think these rich people would want to impose at least SOME restrictions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as requiring recipients to undergo sterilization after the birth of one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or two children.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't!  If we've got close enough to the big S where I can
<br>
afford supporting the world's poor, e.g., about 1/5 of my income
<br>
(assuming the entirely stupid notion that I'd be the only such
<br>
person willing to do so) then I'd not place any restrictions on
<br>
my charity---not to strangers:  I don't like telling people what
<br>
to do.
