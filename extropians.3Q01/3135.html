<p><em>&gt; ...it's a running gag.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So perhaps a small band of Extropians should get together and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; begin pointing out posts that are stupid, daring the social consequences,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since after all it's just a mailing list, and otherwise the quality will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep going down.  This group would be called the &quot;Committee on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Un-Extropian Activities&quot; by way of self-conscious irony
</em><br>
<p>:-)  I'd approve.  But you know what would happen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and to remind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves how dangerous such an endeavor can be... not that we really need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reminding of the danger per se, since it's blindingly obvious to any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropian; more that we acknowledge the danger and openly declare, as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement criticizable by smart but wrong critics, that we think we really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are that good.
</em><br>
<p>While perusing the SL4 archives for some of the months earlier
<br>
in the year, I had to admit that your taste and mine coincided
<br>
on some &quot;Bzzzt&quot; posts not really being SL4, and that I thought
<br>
that such bluntness on your part worked out well.  But I would
<br>
suppose that it put a strain on you after a while.
