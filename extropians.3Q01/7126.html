<em>&gt; But is it still possible to detect steganographic messages if the amount
</em><br>

</em><br>
background?
<br>
<p>Remember that standard graphic algorithms, such as GIF or JPEG, use industry
<br>
standard mathematical algorithms to compress data and smooth insignificant
<br>
variations.  It is easy to use these algorithms to predict how color should
<br>
have been smoothed and to detect bits that deviate from the expected values.
<br>
The whole theory behind color smoothing is that any given bit might be
<br>
random noise which should be overridden with calculations based on its
<br>
neighbors.  The same algorithms can be used to detect these bits that have
<br>
unexpected values.
<br>
<p>For nonstandard algorithms, it is easy to use statistical analysis to
<br>
reverse engineer the smoothing algorithm.  The wrong algorithm won't predict
<br>
the encoding of most pixels.  When the correct algorithm is tried, it
<br>
instantly predicts 99.999% of the pixels, leaving the other 0.001% exposed
<br>
as hidden data.
<br>
<p>Even if no predictable graphical coding algorithm can be deduced,
<br>
statistical analysis of an unknown algorithm would still probably identify
<br>
the alien bits.  A digital picture capable of defining millions of color
<br>
shades might only use a few hundred thousand of them.  When counted up,
<br>
99.999% of the pixels might use the top few hundred thousand popular shades,
<br>
while 0.001% of the pixels define subtle off-shades that did not occur
<br>
naturally in the original picture.  As the ratio of real picture to data
<br>
increased, this only makes it easier for statistical analysis to detect
<br>
alien shades introduced into the picture.
<br>
<p>For a camera lens there is a certain amount of blurring between pixels and
<br>
between shades.  Any pixel which deviates from its neighbor at a faster rate
<br>
than the blurring that occurs in 99.999% of the picture can be identified as
<br>
being too specific for the level of blurring.
<br>
<p>The picture itself can provide clues as well.  A flat area of one color can
<br>
easily be scanned for a few rare bits of another shade.  Any pixel that
<br>
deviates from the narrow range of color values in its local area would be
<br>
identified as containing alien data.  Likewise, the rate of change from one
<br>
shade to another caused by lighting can be mathematically calculated.  Any
<br>
pixel that deviates at a different rate from its neighbors as do the pixels
<br>
surrounding it would be a data pixel.
<br>
<p>Pictures are too predictable, both due to their contents, the technology
<br>
that records them, and the encoding algorithm by which they are expressed.
<br>
In a way, all this interrelated information almost provides a
<br>
self-correcting checksum where each pixel's value can be double-checked by
<br>
its neighbors.  Any pixel that is modified can be detected as falling
<br>
outside a range, having too much precision, or being statistically out of
<br>
place when compared to other pixels.
