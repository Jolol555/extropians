<em>&gt; &gt; Well, considering how much the left accepts the means justifying the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This allegation that illiteracy has increased among African Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following Brown vs Board of Education is, as well as surprising, also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite inaccurate. According to Arthur Hu's statistics site
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www.leconsulting.com/arthurhu/index/literacy.htm">http://www.leconsulting.com/arthurhu/index/literacy.htm</a>), which I hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you find a sufficiently conservative source, illiteracy among blacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over age 14 declined from 11% to 3.6% from 1947 to 1969. 
</em><br>
<p>And what has occured since then, Pat? Since 1969, black illiteracy has
<br>
skyrocketed. I'm not surprised, though, this is rather typical 'cherry
<br>
picking' statistical practice. Integration wasn't even beginning to
<br>
spread widely until 1969, so using pre-1969 statistics to claim that
<br>
black illiteracy has not gone up since BvBOE is a fraudulent
<br>
presentation of facts. The facts you present, of pre-1969 data, show
<br>
that segregated educational systems were having a positive impact upon
<br>
literacy among african-americans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also check out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/publications/majorpub/120yr/porintr1.txt">http://nces.ed.gov/publications/majorpub/120yr/porintr1.txt</a>. I'd be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in seeing the source of your misinformation. I see many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distortions and outright fabrications circulating in conservative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circles. I am beginning to suspect that the garden variety conservative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentality may be somehow less inclined to skepticism and more toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepting questionable data which supports existing ideas. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative disinformation machinery on the internet certainly has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberal analog.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It might help to understand more fully the context of racial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discrimination in education. It formed part of a system to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disenfranchise blacks and poor people in general. Another important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; component was literacy tests. If you didn't educate blacks, you also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denied them political power. This would seem to be highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-libertarian, the way many libertarians present their philosophy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is interesting that your allegation seems to reveal some hostility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward school desegregation. I am surprised that you would attribute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brown vs Board of Education to &quot;the left.&quot; Being perhaps something of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leftist myself, I will take the compliment, but do conservatives oppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that decision? Maybe 40 years ago, but today? I had thought you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered yourself a libertarian. Yet, opposition to school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desegregation would seem to fit a pattern I have noticed among some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;libertarians&quot; of espousing anti-libertarian positions when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict with conservative inclinations. In this instance, a libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would, if true to his or her philosophy, support Brown vs. Board of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Education because it removed government practices which were restrictive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on personal freedom, e.g. attending the school of a person's choice. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have heard many libertarians complain about civil rights laws when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impinged upon the behavior of individuals. But what libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle is transgressed by Brown vs Board of Education, which only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increases personal choice at the expense of government control? One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things libertarians frequently promise, in defense of the removal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civil rights protections in the private sphere, is that a libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government, such as it might be, would treat all citizens fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of race. Is this not what Brown vs Board of Education was all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about? Who would oppose such a law? Certainly such opposition could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be motivated merely be libertarian philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>Nobody would oppose BvBOE on theoretical grounds, but the central claim
<br>
of proponents of integration was that it would allow greater and broader
<br>
scholastic achievement for all african americans. Your 'facts', which
<br>
contain NOTHING about literacy since 1969 (an omission of 32 years of
<br>
data is quite glaring) when integration was just getting started, do
<br>
nothing to prove your point, and only serve to bolster the claims of
<br>
'separate but equal' proponents (of which I am NOT one). 
<br>
<p>What integration has created is a situation where middle class and
<br>
wealthy blacks are able to flee traditionally black school systems and
<br>
institutes of higher education for elite mainstream schools, while the
<br>
majority of blacks, who are poor, have been stuck in the husk of a
<br>
second class educational system. This 'green flight' mirrors the 'white
<br>
flight' phenomena that occured when black institutes attempted to make
<br>
up for this by forcing at gunpoint the force busing system of shipping
<br>
white and black kids out of their neighborhoods and across town to
<br>
schools where they are severely lacking in the social support that is so
<br>
necessary for academic achievement.
