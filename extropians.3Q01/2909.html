<p>I don't know if they were plonking me for that, just for my own comment
<br>
of 'a few food stamps and a bottle of ripple', being the current value
<br>
of '40 acres and a mule'. I found it interesting that they were so
<br>
assiduous in excising the rest of my message, and eliminating all
<br>
context under which I was replying. Typical liberal tactic. Anyone who
<br>
read the rest of my message, or ANY of my other messages on this topic,
<br>
could plainly see that I am most assuredly NOT racist. Their tactics are
<br>
the typical sort of BS and PC selective amnesia that Messrs. Powers and
<br>
Kenny have exhibited here in the past.
