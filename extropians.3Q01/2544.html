<p>That's likely true in some cases, but is it a reasonable 
<br>
generalization?  Falsely projecting one's own faults on one's 
<br>
opponent is not uncommon.  But it's really just a special case of 
<br>
a the more general problem of falsely projecting any kind of 
<br>
negative characteristic on your opponent simply because the straw-
<br>
man is easier to fight than the real opponent.  This is easiest 
<br>
to do when there is some element of truth to the accusation.  So 
<br>
easy that even very thoughtful individuals sometimes deceive 
<br>
themselves and others in this way.  Stereotyping an entire group 
<br>
by pointing out a characteristic exhibited by only a few, or even 
<br>
worse, a characteristic that merely _might_ be present and hasn't 
<br>
necessarily been demonstrated at all, is a prime example.
