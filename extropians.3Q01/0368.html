<em>&gt; Yes, I have spoken for labeling myself.  I fear allowing other people to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; minority.  Let's face it, cryonics, life-extension drugs, life-extending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diets, AI computing, and nanotechnology are controversial issues.  Many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists would gladly override our choices in these matters because they
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; documentation, and then I will make my own choice.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, because you know enough to make informed choices, you are not
<br>
intimidated by long latin-derived scientific words. Nor do you blindly
<br>
accept what the media and left wing groups spout as gospel. The problem
<br>
is that a large number of people do, and repeat it enough that such
<br>
garbage eventually becomes 'common knowledge'. The average consumer
<br>
would not understand enough of the debate to make rational informed
<br>
choices because they don't have the scientific skills to do so, and will
<br>
instead rely on who makes them most fearful for the safety and health of
<br>
their family.
<br>
<p>If you are going to provide full documentation, you cannot leave it in
<br>
the hands of the average teacher to tell you and your kids what that
<br>
documentation means, as we saw so plainly in Stossel's last broadcast.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't trust the tobacco industry to tell me if cigarettes are safe for me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't trust the meat industry to tell me if mad cow disease is a concern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for me.  I don't trust the auto manufacturers to tell me if my RV might flip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over.  I don't trust software manufacturers to tell me if their product has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bugs.  Frankly, I don't trust anybody with a large cash incentive to lie to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me.  Open documentation with independent verification is the only safety
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protocol that works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>And I don't trust groups with agendas that imply the extermination of
<br>
90% of the human race to achieve, which IS what groups like the Greens,
<br>
PETA, and other primitivists will require to achieve their agendas. I
<br>
don't trust the NEA to fully inform the kids. I don't trust the media to
<br>
accurately communicate this information. They would stage the end of the
<br>
world if it meant a quarter of top ratings.
