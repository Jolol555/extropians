<p>The problem with this is that most people use the word &quot;privacy&quot;
<br>
to mean far more than self-ownership; they want to claim ownership
<br>
of ideas in OTHER minds as well.  If no one agrees with or is
<br>
interested in anything else regarding &quot;openness&quot;, at the very
<br>
least we must clearly recognize the objectively different things
<br>
called &quot;privacy&quot;, and stop lumping them together as if they were
<br>
the same.
<br>
<p>Unlike some &quot;transparency&quot; advocates, I totally support the right
<br>
to keep secrets.  What's in your head is absolutely yours, and you
<br>
have every right to do with it as you please, give it away, or
<br>
keep it locked up.  But I utterly reject any claim you have to
<br>
control what _I_ can and can't do with information in _my_ head,
<br>
even if that information happens to be about you.  As I said in
<br>
my talk, I would never sacrifice freedom for security, but telling
<br>
someone else what to do with information in his own head sacrifices
<br>
HIS freedom for a sense of security that might not even be real.
<br>
I cannot demand freedom for myself without granting it to others; I
<br>
cannot demand freedom to speak without allowing those with whom I
<br>
disagree to spout their own drivel; and I cannot demand the freedom
<br>
to use every piece of knowledge I have to better my life without
<br>
granting others the same freedom.
<br>
<p>You happen to know what I look like, what I've written about,
<br>
what part of the country I live in, and many other things.  If you
<br>
can profit from that knowledge, more power to you.  Most such
<br>
knowledge won't be of any use to anyone, so protecting it is a
<br>
waste of time, but if I didn't want such knowledge to be used, I
<br>
would spend my own money to ensure that they didn't get it.  Even
<br>
further than that, I happen to think doing so is a waste of time
<br>
and so I should benefit financially from the fact that I don't
<br>
care who knows what about me, while more paranoid persons waste
<br>
time and money hiding.
