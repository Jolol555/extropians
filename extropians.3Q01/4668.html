<p><em>&gt; Extending credit to [third world] countries [which have for some

</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I like to challenge liberals with this problem:  suppose
<br>
that you were a multi-billionaire and wanted to use exactly
<br>
one of your billions of dollars to benefit the people of some
<br>
poor third-world country.  How would you go about it?
<br>
<p>I expect to hear proposals from the especially naive that the
<br>
money could simply be given to the desperately poor in that
<br>
nation.  Why not split the billion up among the poor of Calcutta
<br>
and Bombay, for example?  The more sophisticated, I would expect
<br>
to suggest that schools and hospitals be built.  While I think
<br>
that indeed some good---even if only for the short term---would
<br>
result, this kind of idea is never going to get the wheels of
<br>
wealth production turning.  I further expect that I can refute
<br>
most of the ideas that liberals would come up with that would
<br>
make use of the billion dollars in any *generous* or *compassionate*
<br>
way.
<br>
<p>What I propose in place of the more &quot;compassionate&quot; suggestions
<br>
---well, after all, I *must* lack compassion, right, since I
<br>
am one of those evil libertarian/conservatives?--- is the 
<br>
following:
<br>
<p>You find some steely-eyed banker who has a sterling reputation
<br>
for making *very* profitable loans to business, give him the
<br>
billion dollars, and ask him to start a bank in the poor
<br>
country.  Your instructions, of course, are that he is to
<br>
make *the largest possible profit* with that billion dollars,
<br>
but he *cannot* invest it outside the target nation.  Going
<br>
strictly for the (Evil) profit, our banker would turn down
<br>
loan after loan from aspiring entrepreneurs in this poor
<br>
nation, extending his investments *only* to those who he would
<br>
bet would be able to pay him back *with interest*.  Now I
<br>
submit that people from the left end of the political spectrum
<br>
have a very hard time with that idea, because of its ostensible
<br>
goal of self-interest.
<br>
