The Beginning of a New History
<br>
<a href="http://www.pugwash.org/reports/pim/pim17.htm">http://www.pugwash.org/reports/pim/pim17.htm</a>
<br>
Francis Fukuyama and Jacques Attali
<br>
respond to Bill Joy's concerns about the ethical implications of new
<br>
technologies
<br>
<p>New Perspectives Quarterly
<br>
<p>NPQ: One idea Joy raises is &quot;to relinquish the pursuit of knowledge and
<br>
development of those technologies so dangerous that we judge it better if they
<br>
are never available.&quot; Is that really viable?
<br>
<p>Fukuyama: Now that we've gotten on this technological escalator it is
<br>
extremely difficult to renounce science, beginning with the scientists
<br>
themselves. In my experience, any suggestion to scientists that society may
<br>
have broader purposes in wanting to slow down or stop technological progress
<br>
is usually met with a wall of incomprehension. Among scientists there is a
<br>
general assumption dating back to Francis Bacon that scientific progress is
<br>
for the better of all mankind.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the time is coming, thanks to arguments by scientists like Bill Joy,
<br>
where that assumption can be questioned in a serious way. Certainly, there is
<br>
no prima facie reason that more scientific progress is, automatically, always
<br>
best. Again, due to the specific character of nuclear weapons, we have managed
<br>
to slow down the proliferation process-at least keeping it in the hands of
<br>
nation states-through diplomatic and institutional means as well as deterrent
<br>
strategies that were designed for that purpose.
<br>
<p>Jacques Attali: Nobody will renounce science, but it will be possible to
<br>
orient it for the best of mankind. Why not create an equivalent to the Pugwash
<br>
Conference convened during the Cold War by scientists and public figures
<br>
seeking to avoid nuclear war? Similarly, the new movement would generate an
<br>
awareness about the perils and promises of the future of science.
<br>
<p>Mankind has now the means to commit species suicide. That deserves some
<br>
attention. Yet, my fight against nuclear proliferation has taught me that
<br>
people are not in the mood today to be worried by very long term threats. They
<br>
are much too focused on survival in the short term.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>It is not the pursuit of knowledge and technology that is dangerous. The real
<br>
danger is the possibility that scientific progress will put powerful
<br>
technologies in the hands of religious fanatics whose exceptionalist beliefs
<br>
enable them to perpetrate mass destruction. If new technologies are outlawed,
<br>
then only outlaws will have new technologies. Proponents of evolutionary phase
<br>
transition intend to liberate intelligence, and opponents mean to enslave it.
<br>
Intelligence itself has no preference. It can wait... and waiting is the most
<br>
powerful tactic of all. &quot;If you can wait long enough,  the whole world will
<br>
crumble at your feet,&quot; says M. T. Ness.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
