</em><br>
<p>Your reasoning (or perhaps Ehrenbach's) about the creation and maintenance
<br>
of wealth is questionable, but I'm glad you brought up the subject of
<br>
housing.
<br>
<p>Actually, comfortable homes could be built on site using local materials for
<br>
very little money. I know this is true, because I built my own house out of
<br>
mud bricks I made myself (I happen to live in a rare county that enforces no
<br>
building restrictions). Total cash expense around $100, although it would
<br>
have been more if I hadn't scrounged metal roofing from a building someone
<br>
wanted torn down.
<br>
<p>So far, the discussions about freedom on this list have focused on taxation
<br>
and public aid to poor people. We haven't talked much about how certain laws
<br>
that most people take for granted especially harm poor people.
<br>
<p>&lt;These laws act to prop up the values of current ocuppied and future
<br>
homes--at the expense of those without a home.&gt;
<br>
<p>Sure, that's true. These laws also benefit manufacturers of electrical
<br>
supplies (eg. laws that require electrical outlets every x number of linear
<br>
feet); manufacturers of plumbing supplies (eg. laws requiring septic systems
<br>
or hook up to city sewage systems rather than more efficient and safer
<br>
composting toilets--or laws such as one in Australia which requires the
<br>
expenditure of $1,500 for a thermophilic composting system that consists of
<br>
a bucket under a toilet seat, a setup which should cost around $3.00);
<br>
manufacturers of electrical and gas appliances, and so forth. In fact,
<br>
lobbyists for such manufacturers are often instrumental in the passage of
<br>
such laws. (I know this both from reading about it and from personal
<br>
observation)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Medical care is another of the pillars of a &quot;comfortable life&quot;.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;note that the physician lobby acted a few years ago to limit the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supply of doctors.
</em><br>
<p>Ditto for lawyers, plumbers, hair stylists, electricians, caterers, and so
<br>
forth. Rather than licensing, I much prefer something such as boards of
<br>
Certified Public Accountants which are not run by the state. A client is
<br>
free to pay more for a CPA or to shop around and find a good non-certified
<br>
accountant.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I could go on and on.
</em><br>
<p>So could I. City landscaping ordinances, for example, that require neatly
<br>
clipped lawns rather than vegetable gardens in front yards. As far as public
<br>
expenditure for landscaping--planting public grounds in food crops rather
<br>
than lawns and ornamental shrubs would provide an incredible amount of food
<br>
at a similar cost. (But of course the whole agricultural system is currently
<br>
propped up by gov't support)
<br>
<p>Social security, unemployment taxes, minimum wages make it more expensive,
<br>
often prohibitively so, for small business owners to hire help. Licensing
<br>
laws make starting a business difficult.
<br>
<p>The public assistance currently available doesn't begin to make up for the
<br>
hardships poor people suffer on account of government involvement in various
<br>
aspects of the economy. Not the least of their hardships is forced
<br>
indoctrination by public schools. One reason I favor a guaranteed minimum
<br>
income over all other sorts of public assistance is that it would leave
<br>
people free to choose their own form of education.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Therefore in order for the vast of majority of wealth to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exist, there MUST be scarcity of resources.
</em><br>
<p>Not so. You're referring here to relative wealth, zero sum games, etc.
