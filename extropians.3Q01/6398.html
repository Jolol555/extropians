<em>&gt; &gt;This is a war of ideas. We are fighting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;an philosophy here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is so true. This whole damn mess is about ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If everybody would forget the ideas and see the *people* then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see how futile the ideals are. These philosophies blind you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the reality. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They make for fanatics. As Anders said, &quot;No ideas are worth dying or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killing for.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the idiots piloting those planes saw the *people* in the buildings 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of being blinded by ideals then the tragedy wouldn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have happened.
</em><br>
<p>Lovely, wave been reduced to the insane point now where our philosophy is to
<br>
disavow philosophy. Our ideals are that we hold no ideals. The philosophy
<br>
that philosophy doesn't matter could only be grasped by brutes. They focus
<br>
on the concrete and forgo the conceptual level. Exactly how do you define
<br>
human life as a value without a philosophy when its philosophy that tells
<br>
you what IS in fact valuable? You cannot escape the requirement to possess
<br>
one... what you can do is default on your requirement for a rational
<br>
philosophy and just drift where the winds take you. This is the most
<br>
commonly chosen path. This is why someone with a integrated view of reality
<br>
seems so alien or dare I use the word &quot;radical&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Bin laten is one little manifestation of that system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Kill him and 500 more will be cranked out. Its the system 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that needs to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;removed and ASAP.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly. If you use guns and weapons of mass destruction you will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perpetuate the system. A more subtle approach is needed -- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one that removes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hold that the religious nutters have over the poor twits who are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hoodwinked into becoming human bombs. You also need to remove 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reason 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the religious nutters feel compelled to denounce USA. That 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partly means 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ensuring USA acts more responsibly in the world arena.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This isn't at all what history has shown. Where were all the terrorist from
<br>
Japan, Germany, or Korea? Historical precedence says that when a country is
<br>
beaten down, for the most part, they shut up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Those countries are the most luddite, anti-technology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;anti-capitalist, anti-reason countries you could find.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ask yourself why that is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then ask yourself how that can be changed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You certainly won't make people in those places love and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admire America by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bombing the crap outa them. You will just ensure that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones there who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already love and admire America get lynched.
</em><br>
<p>By the way, I think we have decent relations with the Japs, and we dropped a
<br>
nuke on them!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Bin Laden needs to be dealt with, but what created him?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sadly, in a very real sense the USA created him.
</em><br>
<p>So which is it? Did the US create him? or was it his philosophy? You say
<br>
below that its the holding of &quot;ideals&quot; that perpetuates all this evil. So he
<br>
ended up with our funds. What he did with them was dictated by his belief
<br>
structure, NOT the US making him bomb our own country. It was an error to
<br>
assist him to begin with, but I can assure you, he doesn't have marching
<br>
orders from the US to attack us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;History is the battle of ideas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and if you don't support your own system with the full 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;correct, they you are going consigned to the quagmire of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guilt that so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;around now seemed to be steeped in. The big enemies we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be fighting on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;our front (as well as those foreign) are guilt and fear. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most of the guilt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is because we still have in this age of moon walks and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supercomputers, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;we still possess the philosophy of cave men. Those that carry that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;philosophy, and its a majority of people for the most part, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deserve it and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the guilt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am sure Bin Laden would agree entirely with that sentiment.
</em><br>
<p>Nice to see you stand up for a void and a nothingness of ideals. Our
<br>
founding fathers would be proud finally being told that concepts like
<br>
freedom, achievement, liberty mean nothing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That really frightens me Jerry -- you are speaking exactly as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a dangerous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fanatic would speak. Are you seriously suggesting that ideas are the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important thing? That freedom from guilt and fear are the key 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to survival? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You do realise that these are big reasons why most of the truly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reprehensible deeds are able to be committed -- that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perpetrators are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convinced that the ideas are more important than anything 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else and that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they shouldn't feel guilty about what they have to do. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Further that they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't feel fear of retribution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;          - Miriam
</em><br>
<p>Damn strait I'm a fanatic for liberty and proud of it. Ill fight to the
<br>
death to preserve it as well, for myself and my children.
<br>
I'm sure everyone here that's spouting against violence feels morally smug
<br>
thinking there's never a time for violence. I for one think that people that
<br>
don't have the strength to define a philosophy and defend it are moral
<br>
cowards. I for one don't agree with the philosophy of the middle east, but
<br>
at least they have the balls to have one. There is no way that man can exist
<br>
without an integrated world view... a philosophy. This moral agnosticism is
<br>
worse by far though. At least their view has a relationship to reality...
<br>
their wrong. The fog of the unknowable ether inhabited by the anti-idealist
<br>
has no relationship to anything. Its free to twist, contort, and dispense
<br>
with its views at whim. The misguided Arabs will eventually have the
<br>
possibility to correct their thinking by correlating it with reality, there
<br>
will be no such chance for the anti-idealist.
