<p>&lt;&lt; It's no secret I'm no scientist, but I'm fairly convinced that the 
<br>
universe 
<br>
&nbsp;as we know it (call it the &quot;usable&quot; universe) will one day play out.  I 
<br>
&nbsp;don't have a problem with that.  For me &quot;immortality&quot; doesn't necessarily 
<br>
&nbsp;mean living unto infinity.  I have a hunch that after a few billion years my 
<br>
&nbsp;curiosity will be pretty much satiated, and I'll be ready to &quot;give up the 
<br>
&nbsp;ghost.&quot;  So I guess I'm not really reaching for forever.  But a couple 
<br>
&nbsp;thousand eons or so would sure be nice.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;-Zero
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Life is good.  Refuse to die (at least for now). &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, its hard to imagine ourselves as a continuous, rational and emotional 
<br>
artifact; that would stay sane for millions or billions of years. At least 
<br>
that is the way it seems from today's vantage. However, there certainly seem 
<br>
to be alternatives to constantly being awake throughout astronomical or 
<br>
cosmological time.
<br>
<p>1. Zero's view: A few thousand years is good enough.
<br>
<p>2. Zero's view-iteration 1: A few centuries or millennia, then back to sleep
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is analogous to a good book, that gets read by its reader every
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;few months or so.
<br>
<p>3. The Singularity View: Whenever you upload, you Will Not remain close to 
<br>
your
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;original personality-set, overtime. You will continue to evolve, change, 
<br>
and become
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more knowledgeable. You will then become fit for adaptation to enormous,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amounts of time. in the same sense that you have adapted to the &quot;working
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world as an adult, that would have been impossible for you to accomplish
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as an infant. 
<br>
<p>4. The Singularity View Iteration 1: You can spawn copies of yourself, which 
<br>
are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;better fitted to survive into astronomical time and are then free to 
<br>
release them,   
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before or after you decide to discontinue.
<br>
<p>5. Dyson View: Things will get less energetic, so your thoughts will get 
<br>
slower and  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slower throughout cosmological time. You won't notice this, because all 
<br>
others
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will have the slows also. Sig Transit Gloria Cosmos.
<br>
<p>6. Moravec view: You will be back again in the minds of an Uber Computer. You,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being the entire visible universe as it once was. Hey, with neutronium, 
<br>
or higgsium
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you get a big hard drive and massive bandwidth! 
<br>
<p>7.  There is Tipler's view, but since he seems so reticent about his own 
<br>
ideas, I will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just leave it at this.
<br>
<p>Point: Its probably a smart idea to consult with a neuroscientist regarding 
<br>
what biological processes induce feelings of satiation and/or boredom.  If 
<br>
you have a bio-body that doesn't get bored (satisfied?) or you become an 
<br>
uploaded computer program, in a Uber-net, would you experience satiation, or 
<br>
boredom? If the answer is no, would we humans seek to pursue this focus? Do 
<br>
we have alternatives to the Big Sleep versus some kind of Obsessive Program 
<br>
Artifact (OPA)? Should we be de-fragged?
