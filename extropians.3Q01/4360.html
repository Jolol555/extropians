religiosity, regardless of its source.  I can hardly believe that this

</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  This was my concern with some recent sources that used
<br>
prayerfully-guided revelations from God as the basis for their scientific
<br>
&quot;facts&quot;.  I did feel uncertain about the validity of their &quot;technical&quot;
<br>
information.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But it is rather frightening to hear
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; what they say.)
</em><br>
<p>I don't know how to make this any clearer to you.  I never said this.  I
<br>
never endorsed this.  I never saw anybody on this list claim this.  I
<br>
disputed the Christian group's conclusions, not because they were
<br>
Christians, but because their methods of prayer and divine guidance were not
<br>
reviewable, provable, falsifiable, objective or reproducible.  The same was
<br>
true for the white supremacist group.  I never said they were wrong because
<br>
of who they are.  I said their facts were wrong because of the faulty way in
<br>
which they were derived.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When we are examining the content of something, it simply should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not matter who said it.  Such &quot;argument from authority&quot; has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discredited, at least in the circles where I hang out, practically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forever.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  But the &quot;facts&quot; presented cannot be mere summary statements.  We
<br>
must have the background methodology to determine how these facts were
<br>
derived.  If the background reveals that the methods come from unreliable
<br>
sources, then the facts are suspect.  Unreliable sources are deemed
<br>
unreliable because of their faulty methods, not because of who they are.
<br>
<p>You seem to be confusing an &quot;Appeal to Science&quot; as an &quot;Appeal to Authority&quot;.
<br>
It is NOT appeal to authority to prefer scientific results over unscientific
<br>
results.  It is NOT an appeal to authority to choose scientist's opinions
<br>
over nonscientist's opinions based on the methodology.  When the methodology
<br>
is not presented in a paper, it is not an appeal to authority to do
<br>
background research to determine what methodologies were used by the author
<br>
to reach the paper's conclusions.
<br>
<p>It may appear to be an &quot;Appeal to Authority&quot; to prefer one person's research
<br>
over another's based on the former being a scientist and the latter being a
<br>
mystic.  But this is not due to their &quot;authority&quot;.  It is due to their
<br>
methods.  Methods that are reviewable, provable, falsifiable, objective and
<br>
reproducible are valid for appeal.  Those that are not are invalid.
<br>
&quot;Authority&quot; has nothing to do with it.
