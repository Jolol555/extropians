I agree with what Russell says with one additional thought. Ethics and
<br>
morality are fully valid within whatever environment a person finds self
<br>
&quot;in&quot;. What person can go through life with no sense of identity,
<br>
heritage, culture, or even some hint of bias with regard to internal
<br>
programming? Cognitively, it is possible for a person to see where he
<br>
is, what he is, and how much of that he may want to change or keep. This
<br>
does not mean a person shall do that, or even should, but it is
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p>Arguments saying non realists want to throw out all morality, all
<br>
foundations, and all things sacred simply are so much posturing which
<br>
sabotages intellectual dialog. Realize we are talking about intellect
<br>
and how we create knowledge; not about the specific things knowledge
<br>
describes, and for this reason realists and non realists talk past each
<br>
other more often than not.
<br>
<p>Reality is a logical construct having implied context and significance.
<br>
People are either in sync on that level or they are not. When people are
<br>
not in sync should we beat them and force them to be? Do their thoughts
<br>
have any validity at all? Yes. Their thoughts have validity to them just
<br>
as our thoughts have validity to each of us individually.
<br>
<p>There is no reality unless there is authority to enforce it whether
<br>
intellectually, socially, morally, or scientifically. Use of reality
<br>
statements in a debate, rather than recital of logical premises to
<br>
support an opinion, are in effect calls for authority, only, and non
<br>
intellectual.

<em>&gt;I *think* Mike meant theorists who deny that there are objective moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;properties. Sociobiology does no such thing. At the most, it shows that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there is a &quot;human nature&quot; in the sense that there is a tendency for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different kinds of human beings (eg sexes, ages) to act in certain ways in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certain environments, and that these tendencies are genetically hard-wired
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into us by the experience of our ancestors in the evolutionary environments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That is an interesting datum, but it goes nowhere near to establishing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;existence of objective moral properties. Indeed, there are respectable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arguments that it actually reinforces subjectivist theories of ethics: moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rules are just subjective to our evolutionary coding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mike would also be familiar the idea that we have an incentive to *change*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our inherited evolutionary coding because it gives us dispositions that may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have increased our inclusive fitness in the evolutionary environment but are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arguably detrimental to our well-being in modern, high-technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;environments. Evolution, of course, does not care about an organism's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well-being but only about its inclusive fitness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Peter Singer has a very good book on the relationship between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sociobiological claims and ethics. IIRC correctly its title is something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like _The Expanding Circle_. He's come back to this issue a lot in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recent work.
</em><br>
