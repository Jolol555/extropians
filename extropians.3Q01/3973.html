<p>The propaganda in this CNN article is hilarious. Let us examine it,
<br>
shall we?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;

In Italy there were eight workers to every pensioner in the 1950s.
<br>
There are less than four today and, without immigration, that number
<br>
will dwindle to 1.5 by 2050.
<br>
&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>[The govt's have turned the social security systems into a ponzi
<br>
scheme.  The rich uns keep bringing in more human cattle for their
<br>
First World ranchlands, and the logic outlined above
<br>
can only end up in ruin for us all! What happens when all these
<br>
imported cattle get old? 
<br>
The rich uns blackmail the citizenry by threatening their social
<br>
security, and ultimately there will be no First World--the graphs
<br>
don't lie!
<br>
<p>What happened to the funds set aside years ago for their old age? What
<br>
happened to the interest on those accrued funds.
<br>
This is nothing but scaremongering ,and ultimately, blackmail....]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
Little wonder, then, that the European Commission, the executive body
<br>
of the 15-nation European Union, has said zero-immigration policies
<br>
are out of step with reality and declared: &quot;Our aim is to open as
<br>
large a debate as possible on immigration and asylum.&quot;
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p><p>[Translation: our aim is to .... hit em hard with more blackmail and
<br>
propanganda!]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
The EU is seeking agreement on a more unified immigration and asylum
<br>
policy by the end of 2001. But the politics of the issue are
<br>
potentially explosive, and politicians in most European countries have
<br>
done little to prepare their citizens for the changes to come. 
<br>
&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>[Translation: the rich uns haven't yet paid the media enough for
<br>
sufficient blackmail and propaganda....
<br>
<p>Ultimately, we need to take back control of our lands and our
<br>
repective First World govt's. The citizenry rightfully own and control
<br>
these lands.  In the end, it will only get worse unless we have a
<br>
bunch of leaders, and take back control of our govts. I suggest
<br>
technology as a means of control.  Instrumentation and monitoring is
<br>
what we need. Cameras, etc.... Also, massive constitutional amendments
<br>
in the USA, and similar measures in Europe.]
