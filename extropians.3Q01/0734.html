<em>&gt; Hi Mike and Hal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for replying to the e-mail I sent out. I've been tracking the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversation that you've been having in regards to my research. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been entertaining!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Both of you have made some great points, particularly you Mike, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points about semantics and the negative stigmatisation of the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cyborg is what makes my research so interesting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd be grateful for any more comments that either of you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding the following questions. If anybody else on the list would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also like to comment I'd be gratefull. This is all really useful for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Do you know of anyone who calls themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cyborg/transhuman/posthuman. Do you know why?
</em><br>
<p>Several people I've known with prosthetics have made self deprecating
<br>
cracks about being cyborgs at one time or another as a source of
<br>
humorous reflection on their condition, which might be the sort of humor
<br>
you get with people sitting on the roofs of their houses in a flood
<br>
joking about their car floating by....
<br>
<p>There is one fellow on the extropians list who is a bit of a New Age nut
<br>
who calls himself a posthuman, without any sort of augmentation at all.
<br>
I think its more of a metaphysical thing for him. We've tried to explain
<br>
how the definitions are in the past and he's mellowed out, but I don't
<br>
think he is at all interested in getting with the program. We extropes
<br>
tend to be, and tend to attract, some very independent minded people, so
<br>
I'm actually surprised that the terms we've developed over time have
<br>
held their meaning as much as they have. I suggest you peruse the
<br>
lextropicon at the extropy.com site for some of the rather interesting
<br>
defintions that have developed over time (exampe: disasturbation
<br>
(pre-Y2K term), the practice of spending one's time talking, planning,
<br>
and preparing excessively, to an obsessional level, for a predicted
<br>
low-risk catastrophe (Y2K, comet strikes, etc)).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) Do you think that how we see technology and machine-human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interaction influences our response or attitide to technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modifications/alterations.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, of course. If a person sees technology as a threat to one's
<br>
employability, that person is likely to develop negative sentiments
<br>
toward technology, as this was the basis of the first Luddite movement.
<br>
If instead they are shown that technology can enable them to make more
<br>
money and be more financially secure, then its a positive influence. The
<br>
problem is whether they are stasists or dynamists. A stasist, of course,
<br>
will tend to see the past and the future on a very linear, flat slope,
<br>
and will resist changes and accelerated rates of growth in technology,
<br>
society, culture, etc....
<br>
<p>Religion, I think, is very important in an individual's view toward
<br>
technology. While christianity originally was a very forward-looking
<br>
theology, it has become very calcified and conservative over time, at
<br>
least in most of its sects, and other theologies like Hinduism, etc have
<br>
similar stasist views, either that everything repeats and cycles, that
<br>
there is no real progress in humanity, and/or that humanity should not
<br>
alter what the deity has decreed.
<br>
<p>Other theologies, like Buddhism, which teach that the individual can
<br>
transcend the eternal wheel, as well as the more progressive christian
<br>
sects that popularize notions like the individual's ability to
<br>
personally communicate with and reach God. Modern humanism has tended
<br>
instead to move away from its 19th century transcendental roots toward a
<br>
more stasist approach that sees technology as a dehumanizing force that
<br>
institutions use to enslave the individual, putting the individual in
<br>
'their place in the wall', as 'a cog in the machine'. All of this tends
<br>
to come from disillusionment with both the industrial revolution's
<br>
promise to raise the quality of life of the former serf population, and
<br>
the socialist revolution's failed promise to do the same. Modern
<br>
socialistic individuals look today toward smaller collective units that
<br>
resemble more the primitivist tribal groupings of prehistory, and which
<br>
denigrate modern power industry in favor of human power and a very
<br>
pastoral/agrarian existence.
<br>
<p>They see the biotechnology movement, for example, as a scheme by
<br>
industry to separate the farmer from the land, and make him dependent
<br>
more upon industry's ability to provide new forms of domesticated
<br>
species. Similarly, they see personal augmentation as a sort of chain
<br>
that binds the individual to high technology and makes the individual
<br>
dependent upon the technologists of industry rather than dependent upon
<br>
'they who know best' in government and intellegentsia.
<br>
<p>I find it rather interesting that those who are most supportive of
<br>
progressive laws like the ADA to help those who are accidentally
<br>
disfigured, take such a dim view of an act of 'voluntary disfigurement'
<br>
to utilize technology that performs better than the body part it is
<br>
replacing, or which adds additional capabilities to a human that raises
<br>
that human above his unaugmented peers in ability. Of course, this is a
<br>
rather radical form of egalatarianism: if you can't share your candy
<br>
with the class, you can't have any yourself. The fact that some may not
<br>
want any candy is used as an excuse to deny everyone else candy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) Why do you think people who call themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cyborgs/posthuman/transhuman are stigmatised by certain groups/people?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) Why do you think people might want to refer to themsleves in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way? Yes Hal, my research is mostly about self-definition!
</em><br>
<p>I would expect individuals who have rather iconoclastic temperaments to
<br>
delight in the shock value, because they know how terms like 'cyborg'
<br>
jar a humaniform conservatives sensibilities, as much as talking openly
<br>
about one's sexuality at a Baptist social would. Then you'd have the
<br>
crusader types, shouting 'equal rights for cyborgs' from the ramparts...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5)What is it about technology, the future etc  that excites you?
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm a guy. ;)
<br>
<p>I see technology as an empowering force for individual liberties, and
<br>
I've always been rather dissatisfied with current day existence. I guess
<br>
reading a lot of sci-fi as a kid was the root cause, and I'm rather
<br>
miffed that we don't all live a Jetson's lifestyle by now....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6) Do you think that future technological modficiations to the body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may mean an end/beginning to humanity as we know it?
</em><br>
<p>No. I suggest you look at my comments in the Singularity discussion that
<br>
occured a few years ago. Here's a link to the whole discussion and a
<br>
link to my comments specifically:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.extropy.com/eo/articles/vi.html">http://www.extropy.com/eo/articles/vi.html</a>
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.extropy.com/eo/articles/vd.html#michael16">http://www.extropy.com/eo/articles/vd.html#michael16</a>
<br>
<p>What is 'as we know it'? And why is our opinion at this point in time at
<br>
all relevant to the lives of people 50-100 years in the future? Do we
<br>
have a right to tell the future how to behave?
<br>
<p>In my opinion, the only opinion that matters about whether an individual
<br>
should modify themselves is their own. Nobody else gets a say or has a
<br>
right. Of course, I'm rather anarchistic that way.
