<p>Excuse me. Calling New Labour neo-luddite I'll buy, but calling
<br>
them socialist, pro-interventionist, left-leaning, or anti-capitalist
<br>
is ridiculous. This is the party that's trying to privatise the air
<br>
traffic control system and the post office, refuses to even discuss
<br>
re-nationalising the rail system (despite ongoing chaos and roughly
<br>
85% public support for taking the track infrastructure back into
<br>
public ownership), and wants to find ways of semi-privatising chunks
<br>
of the NHS. This is the party whose 2001 conference is being sponsored
<br>
by McDonald's. This is _not_ your grandfather's Labour Party.

<p>Hmm. So just what have you made of yourself?
