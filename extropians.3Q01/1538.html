&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really hope this doesnt get out of hand, but Im gonna try to call
<br>
this like I see it. Am I the only one picking up the message that men tend
<br>
to be more drawn to the dynamic environment of Capitalism, where women tend
<br>
to identify more with socialistic view? I think this may stem from some
<br>
genetic orgins. It seems that women tend to relate more to &quot;security&quot; then
<br>
to potential gains from risk. Dont get me wrong, I know this is a
<br>
generalization and that ALL women are not chasing security as their highest
<br>
priority, but there's obviously a large percentage that is. Its obvious in
<br>
political elections and we see it wherever politics are discussed. Im not
<br>
saying one side or the other is right or wrong here, but I can even feel it
<br>
inside myself... The word &quot;SECURITY&quot; to me (as a man) just sounds so
<br>
smothering. Who wants that type of life? Most men dont appear to want to
<br>
beWhere everything is perfectly secure and theres no risk? Tag the word on
<br>
any given government program and its bound to sell.
