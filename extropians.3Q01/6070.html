As some of my posts to the list over the years have shown one of the
<br>
big problems I think we will face in the future is &quot;trustability&quot;.
<br>
How do you trust that you will not be betrayed and/or damaged
<br>
by other entities whose inner workings you cannot verify.
<br>
<p>So, in memory of today's sad events I would like to challenge the
<br>
members of the Extropian community to think long and hard about
<br>
what ways might be used to create innovative solutions to
<br>
terrorism that would increase trustability and personal security
<br>
without imposing restrictions on freedoms (in other words, please,
<br>
please lets not make it a debate about guns).
<br>
<p>Now, with the situation at hand, a couple of ideas occured to me.
<br>
At the first sign of any struggle to take over a &quot;flying bomb&quot;
<br>
the plane could be programmed to enter autopilot mode such that
<br>
it could only be unlocked using commands from the ground after
<br>
flight controllers could convince themselves that the pilots were
<br>
in control.  Obviously this has problems with technical difficulties
<br>
such as loss of communications.
<br>
<p>Another possibility would be a more sophisticated program that would cause
<br>
the plane to fly itself to &quot;safe&quot; locations such as military air bases.
<br>
Monitors for vocal stress patterns in pilot communications would be
<br>
another possibility.
<br>
<p>But, people on the list have discussed before such things as ships
<br>
with atomic bombs entering major harbors.  And of course I'm highly
<br>
aware of the damage that can be done by small bioweapons that are capable
<br>
of spreading themselves.  Today's events apparently were in essence
<br>
predicted in a novel (perhaps by Tom Clancey?) a few years ago
<br>
involving a plane being crashed into the capitol building.
<br>
Why haven't we done anything about it?  Can we come up with good
<br>
technological solutions?
<br>
<p>Lets get off of our collective butts, stop the petty plonkings
<br>
and come up with some ideas for things that could *really* save
<br>
lives.  All the cryonics contracts in the world don't do you any
<br>
good when the plane on which you are flying gets used as a weapon
<br>
of mass distruction.
<br>
<p>On a bright note, it looks like the time between the plane impacts
<br>
and the collapse of the towers was about an hour, so one can hope
<br>
that most of the people were able to evacuate safely.
<br>
<p>Robert
