<p>I suppose my taking great offense at you misspelling my last name
<br>
(typical freakin' englishman) would fall on deaf ears. I'd expect
<br>
someone who claims to have lurked on this list for 4 years would have
<br>
some idea of how to spell my rather simple name.
<br>
<p>I also take great offense to you claiming this is a racist comment. It
<br>
certainly is insensitive, and reflects stereotypes, but I doubt very
<br>
much you'd say it was racist if it was said by a black person (the fact
<br>
is that a prominent black comedian said this very line in on of his
<br>
skits on 'In Living Color').
<br>
<p>The truest test of whether a statement is racist is if it offends no
<br>
matter who says it. If one person can say it as a joke and get a pass on
<br>
it, and another person says it and it offends, it's not racist.
