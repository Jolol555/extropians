<em>&gt; The real problem with the chances of A Bright Future, as envisioned by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropians, et al., is that you-all assume that since the free market is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driven to produce profits, and that the profits follow the superior 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products, then the power of the unleashed free market will save us all by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developing AI, nanotech, etc. The problem with that scenario is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the profits are not really the nirvana that they once were (you're living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the 80's).
</em><br>
<p>a) The &quot;profits&quot; follow the products that people buy because they are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;convinced that they need them.  That is one of the amazing things
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about consumer cycles is that if people feel secure and are optimistic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will buy lots of stuff that they don't really need.
<br>
<p>b) Profits are still what drives the market.  Can you point out a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasonable fraction (I'll settle for 1% of the market) where
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when companies announce falling profits their stock prices rise
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or when they announce rising profits their stock prices fall?
<br>
<p>IMO -- Claims without substantiation.  Opinion without factual basis.
<br>
<p>Yes, investors, particularly those with little experience are driven
<br>
by market trends.  But the core people who manage funds that have to
<br>
provide returns (or they don't have jobs) are not so easily moved
<br>
by such fashion trends.
<br>
<p>Can you show me that Warren Buffet invested in any serious way
<br>
in the dot-com runup (or lost money in its demise)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nowadays, investment capital seeks stock price increases primarily,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not the finished product.
</em><br>
<p>So?  IC at the early stages is risky, it wants to get out before less
<br>
informed investors may distort the market.  All companies go through
<br>
stages where the market for their stock moves from &quot;well informed&quot; investors
<br>
to &quot;less informed&quot; investors (making decisions on &quot;news&quot; rather than
<br>
on &quot;fundamentals&quot;).  Less informed investors are likely to increase
<br>
the volatility of the stock.  There is nothing wrong with wanting to
<br>
avoid that.  Its called proper placement and withdrawal of &quot;risk capital&quot;.
<br>
<p>I have been told though that VC's will retain positions until
<br>
they think the full valuation of their investment has been achieved.
<br>
Sometimes they get this right and sometimes not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The way they get stock price increases is by producing some promising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research, which gets into the news. Then the stock prices go up, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profits are taken *there*, and not from the sale of the product.
</em><br>
<p>Well, speaking from a biotech perspective, it can take 5-10 years
<br>
for the development of a product.  The risk-capital folks get in
<br>
and get out early and move onto the next game.  But you don't see
<br>
the Amgen or Genentech investors complaining about the lack of profits
<br>
their products are generating.
<br>
<p>Generalizations lacking specifics...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem is that the promising research is often vaporware, or so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far from being reduced to practice that its utility is small. So, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the free market will save humanity, but probably only 200 yrs or so from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now....Following through on the research is too long term, either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that or the research is bogus or a dead end, etc...
</em><br>
<p>It isn't so much that promising research is vaporware (though it may be in
<br>
the software industry) but that turning an idea into a product and
<br>
capturing market share is *really* difficult.
<br>
<p>There are lots of cases where the research is valid but the
<br>
timing for entering an ill-defined playing field is wrong.  I know of
<br>
at least 3 candidates for molecular data storage currently.  I suspect
<br>
they all are being backed by VCs or public offerings.  Are they all
<br>
going to succeed?  Probably not.  Will one or two make a big impact?
<br>
Most likely.  That doesn't mean that the research is bogus or a dead
<br>
end but that their timing was incorrect or they didn't have the best
<br>
product.  Natural selection wins.  Investors who didn't do proper
<br>
due diligence lose.  End of story.
<br>
<p>You can turn 200 years into 20 years *if* you understand the problem
<br>
sufficiently.  That is only an order of magnitude and computer
<br>
processing capacity advances by that much every 5 years.
<br>
<p>Just where is the beef in this discussion...
<br>
<p>Robert
