<p><em>&gt; The main problem remaining is social justice: how to ensure that a child 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; born to parents who didn't want and couldn't afford children would not be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condemned to second-class citizenry for their parents' mistake, or that a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genius with a genetic disease would not be cast out of the medical system 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as uninsurable. This wastes very important resources.
</em><br>
<p>There is still this tension between what is good in the short
<br>
run and what is good in the long run.  We might approve of a
<br>
dictator that prevented (somehow) all such waste, but we'd fear
<br>
that in the long run his rule---in ways that could not be
<br>
accurately forseen---would be even more wasteful.
<br>
<p>Our traditions that encourage the maximum of self-reliance in
<br>
people have proven their worth in the long run.  But it is very
<br>
tempting to stop thinking about the long run and deal with the
<br>
here and now.  Which of us has not rewarded, with an act of 
<br>
charity, some kind of mistaken behavior on someone's part?
<br>
<p>Many people on this list are under the influence of some powerful
<br>
memes that have proven their value over hundreds, if not thousands
<br>
of years:  never steal; never encourage indolence or lack of
<br>
success; always mind your own business; never lie.  Societies
<br>
that follow these maxims prosper, and those which do not---or
<br>
at least don't follow them to the same extent---as a number of
<br>
third-world countries, do not prosper.
<br>
<p>We all have sympathy for the downtrodden.  But some of us are
<br>
more likely to give into temptation, in defiance of the memes
<br>
that I was talking about, and reward irresponsibility or lack
<br>
of foresight, more than others of us.
<br>
<p>I would approve of people seeking a middle-ground: we have to
<br>
publicly retain the traditions that created success and wealth
<br>
in the first place, but also exercise charity in those local
<br>
situations about which we are very knowledgable, and judge
<br>
that it can do some good.
<br>
