From: &quot;Alex F. Bokov&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:alexboko@umich.edu?Subject=Re:%20Fred%20Reed%20-%20The%20Dave%20Barry%20of%20Racists&In-Reply-To=&lt;00d301c11b8f$b1e60680$355c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">alexboko@umich.edu</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Maybe, but I doubt it will ever convince anybody who doesn't already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think reparations are silly. Therefore, not memetically effective.
</em><br>
<p>Tragically, you're probably right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The essay was racist, by the way, because it insinuated that African
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans steal bicycles,
</em><br>
<p>It recounted the author's experience (an exercise known to be racist by all
<br>
objective observers, obviously). Sensible readers would not conclude that
<br>
African Americans do _not_ steal bicycles would they? (Well, they might, if
<br>
they hit their foreheads hard with a mallet.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; where in fact everybody knows it's the Irish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who steal bicycles.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed! The Irish are the worst of all bicycle thieves, as well as the most
<br>
egregious racists. ©¿©¬
<br>
<p><em>&gt; African Americans specialize in stereo equipment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russians specialize in software piracy and trolling mailing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lists. This Reed guy should have gotten his facts straight before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going off on his rant.
</em><br>
<p>That is for sure. I will email him immediately to inform him that we all await
<br>
an apology, recanting this extremist statements, and making reparations to Al
<br>
Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, Johnny Cochran, et al.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, as far as accusations of racism go, you're not the one who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be worried. The ones who should be worried are the legitimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; victims of discrimination, because every time somebody cries wolf,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it dilutes the credibility of valid accusations. Squandering the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heavy memetic firepower over the slightest provokation is a major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weakness of the Left Wing, as is tarring all their adversaries with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same brush.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Left Wing&quot;? Oh, you mean those socialist racists. I get it.
<br>
<p>©¿©¬
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, and ego.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
