Depressions caused by loss of economic confidence might be predictable.
<br>
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nsu/010816/010816-12.html">http://www.nature.com/nsu/010816/010816-12.html</a>
<br>
A new model of economic fluctuations suggests that a global recession is
<br>
indeed imminent - probably worse than that of 1990-91 - and that forecasters
<br>
should have spotted it a year ago1.
<br>
<p>Depressions in the US economy become a near-inevitability at least a year
<br>
before they happen, says Elliott Middleton of Placemark Investments in Dallas,
<br>
Texas. His model predicts, a year in advance, all five of the slumps between
<br>
1969 and 1998, and generates no false alarms.
<br>
<p>With this track record, the model's forecast of a recession in the second half
<br>
of 2001 seems worth taking very seriously. Last May, professional economists
<br>
put the chance of such a slump at about one in three; now many businesses are
<br>
bracing themselves for it. Middleton expects the coming recession to be less
<br>
serious than those of the 1970s and 1980s.
<br>
<p>Slumps seem to be an inevitable aspect of any economy; the business cycle of
<br>
boom and bust has become a standard part of economic lore. But these changes
<br>
are not really cyclic at all. Although bad times inevitably follow good, there
<br>
is no regularity to the rise and fall of the economy.
<br>
<p>This makes recessions embarrassingly hard for economists to predict. In the
<br>
words of John Kay of the London Business School: &quot;Economic forecasters all say
<br>
more or less the same thing at the same time, but what they say is almost
<br>
always wrong.&quot;
<br>
<p>Middleton believes that there is something of a self-fulfilling prophecy about
<br>
recessions. Businesses and investors lose confidence in the buoyancy of the
<br>
market; their timidity causes a slowing and eventually a turnaround of
<br>
economic growth. The British economist John Maynard Keynes dubbed these
<br>
subjective levels of market confidence 'animal spirits'.
<br>
<p>Nothing, it seems, deflates these spirits like unemployment. The moment the
<br>
unemployment rate ceases to improve, confidence plummets and the economy heads
<br>
for a turnaround, transforming a boom into a slump. Because unemployment
<br>
levels cannot get better for ever, a boom, in effect, carries the seed of its
<br>
own demise.
<br>
<p>Loss of confidence can be detected in the variations of an economic index
<br>
before the slump itself takes hold, Middleton says. Crucially, he asserts,
<br>
market agents are adaptive: they take their norms from recent events rather
<br>
than from any absolute judgement about what is a good or bad unemployment
<br>
rate.
<br>
<p>So Middleton's model derives confidence changes from adaptive changes in
<br>
unemployment, and uses the resulting prediction to forecast slumps.
<br>
<p>For the post-war US economy, the model works well. But in other countries -
<br>
where the memory of the 1930s' Great Depression is less haunting -
<br>
unemployment might not be the main influence on confidence levels, Middleton
<br>
cautions. This might explain why previous attempts at forecasting have met
<br>
with varying success in different countries.
