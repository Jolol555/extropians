<p>I didn't say &quot;immediately&quot;.  I said &quot;thirty physical seconds&quot;.  That's
<br>
rather a lot of time.

<p><em>&gt; There is a cartoon from the series that I think was called &quot;Bob

</em><br>
<p>Yes, this was the cartoon that was forwarded to me by a friend (Patrick
<br>
McCuller) and that turned me into a regular reader of BATF.  I once
<br>
emailed Stephen Notley (the cartoon writer) asking if I could put that
<br>
image (or rather, a piece of it) on a single T-Shirt.  Later events
<br>
obviated this and that image has yet to make it to a T-Shirt, as far as I
<br>
know, but at any rate I am quite familiar with the image to which you
<br>
refer and once played with it in Photoshop.

<p><em>&gt; In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cartoon the galaxy sized mind is complaining to others of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its kind that it has computed all possible things and finished
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so many picoseconds ago and now there is nothing more to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forever!  A small cluster brain
</em><br>
<p>That's Freddy the Flying Fetus.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; responds, &quot;I told you not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compute It all at once.  I told you you would be sorry!&quot;  :-)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's the pessimistic formulation of Eternal Fun Theory.  Under the
<br>
optimistic formulation of EFT, a brain the size of the galaxy would
<br>
effectively never run out of Fun, even computing at Planck-time speeds
<br>
over a thousand times the age of the Universe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think arriving at the point I spoke of is the Grand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Finale at all.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, just checking.
