<em>&gt;&gt;  I would say there's at least a 5% chance that one or more of those

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wow!  That seems amazingly high to me.  Following Robin's precepts, you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must have seen some evidence that I missed.  What collection of alien 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contact reports have enough plausible details to make you go that high?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;About 25 years ago I looked in Yale's libraries for the best UFO reports.
<br>
I found at least one report of lights in the night sky moving at apparently
<br>
impossible speeds, coming from an experienced observer who I wouldn't
<br>
expect to report deluded or misleading observations (someone who worked
<br>
at an airport, maybe an air traffic controller?). That's about the extent
<br>
of the UFO reports I'm aware of that you might be unfamiliar with. I don't
<br>
think I've read any detailed reports of people who claim to have observed
<br>
humanoid beings. I expect that much of our difference in conclusions is
<br>
due to different biases or reasoning.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It appears to me that the hypothesis that aliens occasionally visit earth
<br>
but don't want to publicize their existence makes predictions that are
<br>
hard to distinguish from the hypothesis that we are alone, so it's hard
<br>
to find reasons beyond Occam's Razor for preferring one of those hypotheses.
<br>
&nbsp;The Fermi paradox appears to indicate something about the probability that
<br>
alien life is nearby, but it also seems to indicate that our intuitions on
<br>
this subject are not very reliable.

<em>&gt;I put the odds of anything rather fantastic, such as either of these

</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Are you implying that the &quot;fit well together&quot; criterion justifies
<br>
believing million to one probabilities? It seems to me that one should
<br>
deduce probabilities from such a fit by looking at how often similar
<br>
sets of explanations have been discredited in the past, and that in
<br>
order to deduce million to one odds, one would have to be aware of
<br>
on the order of one million similar sets of explanations that haven't
<br>
been discredited. Do you claim to be aware of that many similar cases?
<br>
If not, how does your analysis differ from mine?
