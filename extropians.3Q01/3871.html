<p><em>&gt; In short, *the President is being guided by an explicit and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowing enemy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry, but I have to say that I saw this coming. Then again, I'm an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australian. *I* didn't vote into power a guy who was likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use Leon Kass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as his bioethical guru (not that Gore would have been much better, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose, and not that the situation is so much better here).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, we all have to understand that it's not just Kass. Kass's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; views are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far more common than you think, and far more resonant with the community
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than transhumanism. The question is what to do about it. (Thanks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for getting us focused on something important, zeb.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes indeed.
<br>
<p>I'm accumulating essay ideas for the Longevity Meme at the moment; stuff
<br>
aimed at the average everyday people in the street. As I was pondering the
<br>
latest [&quot;Technologies of Life&quot; -- I think that it's a sufficiently good
<br>
positive phrase to merit a good essay to propagate it in connection with
<br>
stem cell stuff, cloning, life extension, etc, etc], it suddenly occurred to
<br>
me that I'm living in a land run by people who actively want to murder me.
<br>
And everyone else. It's their position that we're all better off dying, and
<br>
they're prepared to put the effort into making that happen.
<br>
<p>I think that most of the rest of you are in the same position.
<br>
<p>Unless we make moves, get off our collective asses, organize, recruit,
<br>
popularize our movement, spread some better memes, we're all in trouble. As
<br>
I've said before, any given government is quite capable of retarding any
<br>
technology by at least a decade. None of us have decades to spare.
<br>
<p>And that's without even stopping to consider that without high levels of
<br>
activism, the technology to save our lives may come too late. A lot of
<br>
people on this list are prepared to *assume* that we're going to get bailed
<br>
out. Is this something you really want to gamble your existance on?
