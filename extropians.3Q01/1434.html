Spike said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In any struggle for the hearts and minds of the proletariat, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;significant advantage goes to the side that can reduce its message
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on a bumper sticker. &lt;snip&gt;  &gt;Extropianism and transhumanism have no snappy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;little phrases
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to counterbalance the kinds of examples given above.  Do we? &lt;examples 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;followed&gt;
</em><br>
<p>As you can see, these dont have the punch of the
<br>
<em>&gt;previous set of examples.  I can use some help from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the great collective extro-mind.
</em><br>
<p>If I get inspired I'll tell ya.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, some thoughts. At the moment, transhumanism isn't even on the 
<br>
radar for most people. Same even with nano, cryonics, etc. Thus lots of 
<br>
clever phrases would just seem obscure at this point in the meme war.
<br>
<p>Then there are ideas that I think really need to be bracketed off in public 
<br>
debate. I don't see why we should be committed to any closely-defined 
<br>
particular political viewpoint, for example, even if we are all attracted to 
<br>
positions that are libertarian in one of the many senses of that word (and 
<br>
which I'm sure we'll keep discussing). The extropian principles allow for a 
<br>
range of &quot;open societies&quot; and most people are frightened by libertarian 
<br>
views, however defensible those views may seem to any of us.
<br>
<p>However, there's a lot of point, I think, to getting behind campaigns for 
<br>
basic political rights such as freedom of speech, religion and conscience, 
<br>
and adopting the associated slogans. Over the next couple of decades, the 
<br>
luddites are going to try to suppress technologies and try to drive out 
<br>
views that they consider &quot;metaphysically damaging&quot; (yes, that is the 
<br>
expression I keep seeing). In doing so, they will reject the classical 
<br>
liberal ideal of society. The classical liberal ideal has no room for the 
<br>
imposition of metaphysical beliefs and is our great strength. If we continue 
<br>
to live in a society where the classical liberal ideal is, er, respected, I 
<br>
think the necessary technologies will be developed and marketed by people 
<br>
with the interest and talent, and will be taken up widely as their 
<br>
advantages are seen by ordinary people.
<br>
<p>Beyond that, since we have to take it one step at a time, I tend to think 
<br>
that the initial focus of our more positive meme deployment should be on the 
<br>
idea that extended life is a good idea. That is hard for lots of people to 
<br>
swallow ideologically (extended longevity - it's, it's &lt;splutter&gt; 
<br>
*unnatural*), but it also has an obvious attraction. Almost everyone wants 
<br>
to live longer.
<br>
<p>Once we make some headway getting this idea out as a legitimate one, a lot 
<br>
of other stuff follows.
<br>
<p>I like Reason's focus on the longevity meme. I also like Zero's slogan: 
<br>
&quot;Life is good. Refuse to die.&quot; If we could come up with a few more like this 
<br>
it'd be great.
<br>
<p>If Eliezer's work is successful, I guess the meme war is almost irrelevant. 
<br>
But I don't want to put all my eggs in the one singularity.
<br>
<p>Russell
