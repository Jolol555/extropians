From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Questions%20about%20the%20Singularity&In-Reply-To=&lt;003501c137e2$671bdb60$c8c8f418@southmount.com&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmm, do you mean that since some philosophers thought comprehension of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eudaimonia was not possible for the many and the singularity is also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incomprehensible, there is a link? That sounds rather far-fetched.
</em><br>
Really? What exactly do you find far-fetched? It seems to me that in both
<br>
cases there is said to be an epistemic gap between (t least some) humans and
<br>
those that are more godlike in their wisdom. If this epistemic similarity is
<br>
not sufficient to constitute a link reflect on the fact that it seems to
<br>
raise the same sorts of ethical and political consequences. If the
<br>
postsingularity beings are wiser than us then they may have a better idea of
<br>
what are eudaimonia consists in than we do; which is analogous to the
<br>
position Plato attributes to the philosopher-king as compared with the hoi
<br>
polloi. Plato thought the philosopher-kings and the guardians would be
<br>
justified in bringing the many into line by force and deceit. Will the
<br>
postsingularity beings be similarly justified?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; (in the Republic) where he contrasts the wisdom of the philosopher king
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being analogous to a free person enjoying the sunlight; while the vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; majority of humanity are like slaves who live there whole life shackled
</em><br>
to a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cave wall forever cut-off from seeing things as they truly are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the singularity case *all* of humanity are shackled to the wall, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the images we see do not have any necessary relationship with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-singularity world.
</em><br>
Of course Plato did not think that the many could sort out which images have
<br>
a close connection to the real and those that don't, hence, of course, why
<br>
the poets are to be escorted out of the ideal city-state.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To extend the analogy, they could just be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reflections from a puddle of water near the entrance. The eudaimonic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue is how to get out of the cave, and it is likely not helped by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intense study of the waves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I am not sure I understand your analogy but I think I agree if you mean that
<br>
we ought not to focus exclusively on the limitations of our vision.
<br>
Eudamonistic theory is always triparte: it has a theory of humans as they
<br>
are, humans as they should be if they realized their potential, and a theory
<br>
about how to get from one to the other. Aristotle's metaphysical biology
<br>
gives him his theory of what humans should be, i.e., his theory about what
<br>
it would be for us to fully realize our essence. His theory of education and
<br>
practical reasoning is supposed to help us get from where we are to where we
<br>
should be. Of course for us education and pratical reasoning must be
<br>
supplemented with a theory of how technology might allow us to turbo-charge
<br>
various aspects of ourselves. Unlike Aristotle, we must admit that our view
<br>
of what kinds of beings we ought to be is not sufficiently clear; we might
<br>
need to be wiser than we are in order to fully appreciate what our
<br>
eudaimonia consists in. Ours then is like the medieval quest where even the
<br>
object of the quest is not fully cognized by its participants--we only see
<br>
our telos through a glass-darkly--and only becomes clearer during the
<br>
journey.
