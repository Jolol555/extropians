<em>&gt; &gt; The requirements for the SDI system are, according to the estmates for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the numbers of lines of code, fully within today's capability, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; every major operating sytem runs with more lines of code today. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is illuminating is that every time industry capabilities reach the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; alleged amount of code SDI's detractors claim is necessary, they move
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the mark.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Redell's argument isn't that the system is too big.  He's worked on big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems.  His argument is that existing big systems that work are used and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tested in non-critical situations before they're deployed in the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world.  As they get more use, people are willing to rely on them more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When a large reservation system, or a new telephone switch, or the control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system for a airframe is developed, it can be tested in simulations, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then with larger and larger groups of testers.  Each change in the deployed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment reveals more bugs, which are worked around, lived with, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repaired.  Each change in the environment is accompanied by warnings to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; users to expect glitches.  SDI isn't going to be deployed to protect small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towns from small barrages, then larger areas from larger attacks, etc.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be tested in larger and larger simulations, but in the first attack,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it has to perform flawlessly, or it won't have made things much better.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it will initially be deployed as single systems that can be
<br>
tested in real world conditions. For example, the THEL (Tactical High
<br>
Energy Laser) project is a joint project between SDIO and the Israeli
<br>
military, which has already demonstrated its effectiveness in tracking
<br>
and completely destroying a fully armed tactical ballistic missile at
<br>
SCUD range. These systems will be developed and deployed as fully
<br>
functional multi-node systems with interlocking coverage. They can be
<br>
tested with live fire exercises, expending missiles slated for
<br>
destruction under missile reduction treaties.
<br>
<p>The Space Based Laser system, which is being developed, will likely be
<br>
deployed incrementally, with a dozen or so laser battle stations at
<br>
first for interdiction of the 'rogue nukes' threat, with worldwide
<br>
coverage of one station at a time. As additional stations are launched,
<br>
their coverage increases until several stations are covering any given
<br>
point. This system can also be tested with live fire exercises over the
<br>
Kwajelein Missile Range with missiles slated for destruction.
<br>
<p>The Patriot PAC2 system and the new Aegis upgrade systems, as well as
<br>
the Airborne Laser Battlestation are all well developed systems that can
<br>
be deployed to locations like Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea to engage
<br>
Chinese and North Korean ICBMs in boost phase on a dedicated basis.
<br>
<p>The point of a defensive system is not to eliminate every missile that
<br>
gets through, it is having a system that is good enough to eliminate
<br>
enough missiles that any actual damage done is not worth the cost of all
<br>
the lost missiles.
<br>
<p>Hostile powers work on developing weapons of mass destruction because
<br>
they are economical means of holding people hostage. Discouraging them
<br>
from engaging in such development simply requires making the return on
<br>
investment too high for reasonable use.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Which is why deployment is being deferred for more research with other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hope that's the case.  That isn't the way I remember Bush's rhetoric.
</em><br>
<p>The announcements this past week announcing an increase in funding for
<br>
more research state this.
