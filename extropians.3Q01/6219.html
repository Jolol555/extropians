One idea which we have discussed for being protected from danger is to
<br>
retreat from the physical world.  Your vulnerable body would be protected
<br>
at home (maybe even in an underground bunker) while you interact with
<br>
the rest of the world electronically.  Telepresence and virtual reality
<br>
systems would allow you to effectively travel anywhere in the world,
<br>
instantly and safely.  Meanwhile cryptography would provide you with
<br>
privacy and untraceability even in a world dominated by physical
<br>
surveillance.
<br>
<p>Of course, this is not a terribly appealing picture even to many of us
<br>
who embrace future technologies.  For the average person it sounds like
<br>
a nightmare, being locked away from the world forever.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless even early versions of these technologies could reduce our
<br>
vulnerability to terrorism.  There is really little reason in this day
<br>
and age for huge numbers of people to congregate in skyscrapers for the
<br>
purpose of managing financial transactions.  Finance is a business based
<br>
on information - bits not atoms.  While it is convenient to be able to
<br>
travel for a few minutes to meet with others in the same industry, in
<br>
most cases a phone call would be just as effective.  With the addition
<br>
of low-cost video conferencing capabilities, most of the benefits of
<br>
large offices could be eliminated.
<br>
<p>Likewise a great deal of business travel is unnecessary and could be
<br>
replaced by improved telepresence systems.  With the likely restrictions
<br>
and security complications to be introduced into air travel, along with
<br>
the fear that people will have of future terrorist activity, we may well
<br>
see increased demand for technological replacements.  Today's systems
<br>
don't work all that well, but all that is needed is innovation along with
<br>
practice in using the system.
<br>
<p>Telepresence isn't necessarily something that works naturally; you
<br>
may have to work at it and learn how to use it best.  The same thing
<br>
happened when we learned to use the telephone but for most of us we
<br>
were pretty young.  Given the tremendous human versatility and talent
<br>
for communicating, I believe that with practice people will be able to
<br>
use teleconferencing and other telepresence systems as effectively as
<br>
being there in person.
<br>
<p>None of this will make the world safe, but if we work towards dispersing
<br>
the large concentrations of people which make such inviting targets,
<br>
we can reduce the actual costs of terrorist acts.
