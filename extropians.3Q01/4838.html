Kids with high IQ may persuade Mom to breast feed for longer.
<br>
<p>LONDON (Reuters) - Intelligence of babies may affect how long they breast
<br>
feed, according to research published on Wednesday.
<br>
<p>Medical experts at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology
<br>
tested the intellectual and motor skills of 345 children at 13 months and
<br>
then five years of age. Nearly two-thirds were breast-fed for six months or
<br>
more but 17 percent were moved to bottle-feeding at less than three months
<br>
old.
<br>
<p>The team, led by Dr. Torstein Vik, found no correlation between
<br>
breastfeeding and motor skills at either age.
<br>
<p>But those who rated below average for mental skills at 13 months and for total
<br>
intelligence by the age of five, had not managed to persuade Moms to give them
<br>
breast milk
<br>
<p>The findings, which support the ``smart kid gets the tit'' theory advanced by
<br>
Alligator Grundy, were released in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, a
<br>
specialist publication of the British Mammary Journal.
<br>
<p>``We found a positive association between duration of breast feeding and
<br>
mental development even after adjusting for maternal age, maternal
<br>
education, maternal intelligence and smoking at the time of conception,''
<br>
the researchers' paper concluded that it's not the Moms who made the
<br>
difference, it's the IQ of their kids.
