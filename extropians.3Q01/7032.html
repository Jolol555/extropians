<p>Greg, I am concerned about your attitude toward Islam.  Are you aware that
<br>
the above statements are also true of Judaism and Christianity?  If you read
<br>
the war-like ancient religious texts from the early Middle East, they all
<br>
say this.  The commandments and teachings of both Judaism (and later
<br>
Christianity) and Islam stem from the early Semitic writings about the early
<br>
tribes warring among themselves.  They all argue for isolationism, racism
<br>
and being victorious in battle over the enemy.
<br>
<p>Everything you say about Islam is true to some degree.  But in the same way
<br>
it is true about Judaism and Christianity, it is usually not interpreted
<br>
that way by its followers.  Most Muslims interpret Islam as being about love
<br>
and peace, as Christians and Jews would claim about their religions.
<br>
<p>Are you attacking all religions, or at least the big three, as being roots
<br>
of violence?  Or are you claiming that some religions are more violent than
<br>
others?  You seem to be singling out Islam, when I am not sure it is any
<br>
more violent than other religions.
