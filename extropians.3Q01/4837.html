<p>Your implicit assumption here is that customers are powerless and clueless.
<br>
Why are they powerless and clueless? Because they have been taught to be so
<br>
from birth by a government that reinforces the message &quot;you are powerless
<br>
and clueless&quot; with every new piece of legislation that assumes people can't
<br>
make educated decisions.
<br>
<p>In a completely free market in which the government performs no oversight,
<br>
the role of oversight and monitoring becomes open to for-profit concerns,
<br>
who will spring up and compete for the dollars that acting in that role can
<br>
bring. Because a corrupt oversight organization is one that will shortly go
<br>
out of business [unless of course, it happens to be the government :) ], you
<br>
have your free market model for self-regulation right there.
<br>
<p>One would also assume that a completely free market would &quot;evolve&quot; more
<br>
aware, responsible and proactive consumers -- a very good thing in my mind.
<br>
How can you expect the quality of society to improve when every effort is
<br>
made to put social processes in place that encourage people to be
<br>
uneducated, lazy and complacent?
