</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Grrr. The open source movement is absolutely not &quot;heavily populated by
<br>
anti-property anarchists&quot;. In my entire participation and involvement in
<br>
open source projects, I have yet to meet one single anti-property anarchist.
<br>
In general, open source developers are motiviated self-starters who are
<br>
there because it gives them a tangible benefit; either a) it looks good on
<br>
their resume, b) its (correctly) viewed as a good way of improving their
<br>
skills, c) they want to make use of the code that they are working on and it
<br>
isn't quite right yet.
<br>
<p>IMHO, most &quot;anti-property anarchists&quot; don't have the self-control and work
<br>
ethic to make good developers. I'm sure those of them that understand open
<br>
source (www.opensource.org) and free software (www.gnu.org) have an opinion
<br>
on it, but does that really matter? No, because they're not participating.
<br>
<p>Another correction: open source is not about &quot;giving your work away.&quot;
<br>
Authors retain ownership. Open source is about licensing in a way that
<br>
encourages other people to add to your code openly. Free software is about
<br>
much the same thing -- including authors retaining ownership -- but with a
<br>
few added restrictions to prevent people from making alterations in secret.
<br>
Go read the docs at the above linked sites.
<br>
<p>Both open source and free software arise in a capitalist, property-related
<br>
environment. They deal with issues of licensing, not issues of ownership.
<br>
The two movements arose to address a number of tangible, specific problems
<br>
that came about due to copyright and intellectual property laws (more
<br>
government interference in a market introducing convolutions) encouraging
<br>
inefficient (closed source) software development processes.
<br>
<p>As is put by a number of people; why would you buy a physical product that
<br>
you are not allowed to take apart and repair? What if your car has the hood
<br>
welded down and only the car manufacturer is allowed by law to repair it?
<br>
Open source is the default state of affairs -- it's just that IP laws
<br>
(market interference through legislation) led to closed source becoming more
<br>
profitable back in the day.
