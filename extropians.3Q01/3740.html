<p>This statement doesn't make any sense to me.  If telomeres are &quot;reset&quot;, then
<br>
you would expect them to be the same length as an average newborn.
<br>
<p>I agree (though I haven't got references handy) that the impression
<br>
seems to be that in cloned animals the telomeres are shorter and
<br>
that would imply they are not being completely &quot;reset&quot;.  Its an
<br>
open question in my mind whether telomere resetting occurs in
<br>
the germ cells or after the egg-sperm fusion.  If some fraction
<br>
of the reset process occurs in either of those two situations,
<br>
then you aren't going to get the desired result with nuclear
<br>
transfer from adult cells into denucleated eggs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not so sure; since most of the original TTAGGGs are lopped during

</em><br>
<p>Hmmmm.... this remans an undecided problem IMO.  Telomerase remains
<br>
active to some extent in any quasi-stem cells.  The question is whether
<br>
or not the cells that produce viable clones are to some extent such
<br>
viable stem cells.  Intestinal crypt cells, which I believe were the
<br>
been the source of the nuclei for Dolly, do have stem-cell like
<br>
properties since they are dividing on a daily-to-weekly basis.
<br>
If they didn't have telomerase active then would hit the Hayflick
<br>
limit in the first couple of years of your life.

<p>PLEASE, do not compare mechanisms of aging in mice with mechanisms
<br>
of aging in sheep with mechanisms of aging in humans.  Mice have *much*
<br>
longer telomeres than humans do.  Their cells are also much easier to
<br>
transform into cancerous cells than human cells are.  Short telomeres
<br>
are an anti-cancer (and pro-&quot;aging&quot;) program only in species that have
<br>
had to develop such programs.  Mice, and to a lesser extent sheep, do
<br>
not live long enough to need as many redundant cancer-prevention programs
<br>
and so the length of their telomeres may have much less significance
<br>
than it does in humans.
<br>
<p>My take -- unless you reset human telomere length to the normal newborn
<br>
length in cloned cells (or adult stem cells), you are going to be starting
<br>
with a pre-aged program.  If you *do* reset telomere length in cloned
<br>
cells from embryos, all bets are off because those cells will not have
<br>
gone through the selection process that deletes programs that are
<br>
developmentally defective.  If you *do* reset telomere length in cloned
<br>
cells from adults, then you have a program that has certainly accumulated
<br>
an unknown mutational load (and may therefore be slanted towards a
<br>
pre-cancerous state).  The cells you *should* be using are those
<br>
from newborn infants, say from umbilical cords, where you know they
<br>
produced a viable human but haven't accumulated a mutational load
<br>
from years of living in a hazardous environment.
