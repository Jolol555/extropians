<em>&gt; Wrong. &quot;Moral principles&quot; are exactly what combatants hide behind to justify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their grab for territory and resources. Morality derives from biology.

</em><br>
<p>The abuse of moral principles. The Law of War, for instance, are moral
<br>
principles that divides combatant from non-combatant. The abuse of this,
<br>
where a combatant hides as a civilian among civilians, and the
<br>
acceptance by the civilians of this state to achieve their own goals,
<br>
strips the law of all meaning. In this case, the combatant is using the
<br>
civilian as a shield, a weapon, against the enemy that is two edged: if
<br>
the enemy does not attack the civilian to get to the combatant, the
<br>
combatant wins, and if the enemy does attack, the combatant wins via
<br>
propaganda and international sympathy. If the civilian accepts the
<br>
presence of combatants in civilian garb in their midst, they are
<br>
accepting the role of 'weapon/shield' and are therefore no longer
<br>
non-combatants.
<br>
<p>The Laws of War forbid the wear of civilian garb by combatants. To do so
<br>
is a war crime.
<br>
The Laws of War forbid the placement of military assets among a civilian
<br>
population. To do so is a war crime. Combatants who violate these
<br>
precepts do so on the expectation that the world will not prosecute them
<br>
for these war crimes.
<br>
The Laws of War forbid civilians from taking up arms. Bearing arms in a
<br>
zone of conflict identifies you as a combatant and therefore a
<br>
legitimate target. Disarming an armed civilian who has been shot to make
<br>
it appear as if they were a noncombatant is also a war crime. This is
<br>
one that occurs with regularity in Palestine these days.
<br>
<p>The Combatant who commits such war crimes does so because they expect to
<br>
die and are not afraid of any punishment they may receive.
<br>
<p>The problem with these sort of war crimes is that they are so borderline
<br>
that they can easily be abused for propaganda purposes to great effect.
