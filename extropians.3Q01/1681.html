<p><em>&gt; Are their mitochondria different? I would think that their higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  metabolic rate is due to more mitochondria rather than more efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  mitochondria. Anybody who knows, my animal physiology textbooks didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  give a clear answer. 
</em><br>
<p>Generically, warm-blooded mammals don't differ too
<br>
much in mitochondrial efficiency; they all operate 
<br>
at obscenely low oxygen tensions (try 5% of atmospheric)
<br>
Differences in throughput result from differences in
<br>
oxygen delivery; for example, birds have this nifty
<br>
lung system which separates incoming from outgoing
<br>
air so the first part of a breath isn't used air.
<br>
Well, nifty for oxygen transport; seems to make them
<br>
more susceptible to pulmonary infections.
<br>
<p>Mitochondria differ a lot in their ability to manage
<br>
free radicals but those abilities are encoded in
<br>
the nucleus and transported to the mitochondria.
<br>
It's an excellent bet that bird or bats have such
<br>
secondary enzymes that would really help us.  We'd
<br>
need to engineer our nuclei though; xplanting the
<br>
mitochondria wouldn't help.  Bats would likely be
<br>
a better source than birds since they're more closely
<br>
related.
