<p>Nah, just upload them. Kill them (cure them) with kindness, by giving
<br>
them the circuitry of logic and objectivity that were never trained into
<br>
their minds in childhood.
<br>
<p>Now, the lefties are the ones who don't trust individuals and rely on
<br>
state organs to keep us individualists leashed. Of course, thats only if
<br>
the people running those organs are politically vetted as one of their
<br>
agendafolk.
