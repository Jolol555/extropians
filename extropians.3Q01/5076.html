<em>&gt;Well, it's not so much that, as that these issues have been kicked around

<p>Thanks, Damien, for the Great Filter link.  For those who haven't visited
<br>
yet:  It is a fairly detailed commentary on the problems of aliens
<br>
reaching the Singularity, with implications for how difficult it might be
<br>
for us to reach it.  It is much more thorough than my previous post on
<br>
the issue.
<br>
<p>A clarification on that previous post:  The 1% was a guesstimate of the
<br>
probability that the number of true UFO stories is nonzero, not the
<br>
probability that they as a group are true.  It is obvious that the vast
<br>
majority of UFO stories are BS, because this is the sort of meme which
<br>
feeds on itself through hoaxers, crazies, and people in need of attention.
<br>
As Charlie pointed out, most UFO tales are just modern versions of the
<br>
old legends of succubi, incubi, etc. and are therefore suspect.  This
<br>
makes UFOlogy like searching for probably nonexistent needle a needle in
<br>
a very large haystack.  However, it is highly unlikely that a true UFO
<br>
story would involve genuine aliens, for reasons previously mentioned.
<br>
<p>Anyone else out there with a manifesto on a recurring topic?  Just so we
<br>
newbies don't continuously unearth old threads.  I've lurked for a year
<br>
without seeing this one- but my sampling has only been 25%, due to lack of
<br>
time.  Now, time to bury this thread... for a couple months.
