<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;For over seven years the United States has been occupying the
</em><br>
lands of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Islam in the holiest of places, the Arabian peninsula,
</em><br>
plundering
<br>
its riches,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  dictating to its rulers, humiliating its people, terrorizing
</em><br>
its
<br>
neighbours,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  and turning its bases in the peninsula into a spearhead
</em><br>
through
<br>
which to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  fight the neighbouring Muslim peoples .  . . .&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Bin Laden called upon Muslims to fight against the United
</em><br>
States
<br>
and its
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  people &quot;in accordance with the words of Almighty God.&quot; (19)
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, for people on the list who would argue moderation, one has
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recognize that &quot;war&quot; has been declared on us.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; For those who would argue immoderation, one has to recognize _why_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;war&quot; has been declared on us.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Blah blah. By the same logic, we should have been moderate with
</em><br>
Japan,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; since they claimed they were only 'defending' themselves against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trade embargo we had imposed on them prior to Dec 7th, and we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have been 'moderate' with the Nazis, since they claimed that they
</em><br>
were
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only regaining territory that had been taken from them unjustly in
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Versailles treaty, and were, according to them, dealing with
</em><br>
'criminal'
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; elements (jews and communists) that had contributed to Germany's
</em><br>
defeat.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; See what happens to open minded people? Their brains fall out.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt; See what happens to close minded people?  They draw highly inaccurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parallels and get somewhat insulting of those who think differently.
</em><br>
It
<br>
<em>&gt; obviously is quite important to recognize what it is that we do that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provokes terrorists activities and a great deal of hate toward this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country.  Some of it is for our virtues, true enough.  But more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a little is also for our faults, especially faults of policy and of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  IMHO, this is essentially a war about American foreign policy
<br>
rather than Western civilisation. And whether this attack was motivated
<br>
by
<br>
the interventionist foreign policy of the US or not, the US should not
<br>
be
<br>
intervening all over the globe. I think that is the cause of much hatred
<br>
directed at the US. For example, in the 1950's the US and British secret
<br>
services engineered the overthrow of the popularly supported prime
<br>
minister
<br>
of Iran, installed and enabled the Shah, who brutalized his subjects.
<br>
When
<br>
they finally overthrew him arround 1980, they attatcked the US embassy
<br>
and
<br>
took hostages. They didn't attatck and take hostages from other western
<br>
nations. They were angry at us for past actions.
<br>
<p>Some estimate that the Gulf War and subsequent embargo have killed 1
<br>
million
<br>
Iraquis, most of them civilians. How's that for &quot;collateral damage?&quot;
<br>
<p>In 1998 President Clinton, on the day that the evening news would have
<br>
led
<br>
with the story of deposition being taken in the White House intern
<br>
matter,
<br>
ordered the launch of cruise misiles that destroyed a medical facility
<br>
in
<br>
the Sudan. It has been estimated that the lack of medical supplies
<br>
because
<br>
of that attack resulted in 10,000 deaths. Subsequent review of the
<br>
evidence
<br>
that was used to justify that attack reveals it to be woefully
<br>
inadequate.
<br>
So much so that many have concluded that the attack was either launched
<br>
to
<br>
help bury the news of the Presidents private affairs, or represents a
<br>
use of
<br>
force that was so unjustified as to call into question the decision
<br>
making
<br>
powers of that chief executive. How convienient for Presidents who need
<br>
some
<br>
media event are these disposable corners of the third world to lob
<br>
cruise
<br>
misiles into.
<br>
<p>How could anyone be mad at the US?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I personally find it quite disturbing when Bush said that other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries are either with us and by implicaiton with our policies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our &quot;war on terrorism&quot; or are with the terrorists.  That is a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous and blatantly false dichotomy.  One can be very much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against terrorism and still not believe the planned and proposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions are reasonable and not back them.  The same is true of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations.  Just because we have been hurt badly is not an excuse for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polarizing the world into &quot;for US&quot; and &quot;against US&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Well said.  I heard they changed the new marketing slogan to Operation
<br>
Infinite Arrogance.
