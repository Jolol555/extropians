Daniel Ust wrote a good piece containing a number of solid pronouncements.
<br>
(Especially lucid excerpts below.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Laws which support [abusing people] are wrong and need not be obeyed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, to obey them is often to aid and abet the rights violations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, it depends on the situation one finds oneself in.
</em><br>
<p>What do you say to the retort that we all should be biased towards
<br>
obeying the law (out of principle, not fear) for the sake of compromise?
<br>
There are very few laws that everyone likes, especially the less important
<br>
ones.

<p>Let's not restrict ourselves to the internet's favorite whipping boys, if
<br>
you are going criticize or rebel against some law, generally you're going
<br>
to do it from some rival standard -- i.e., not from the positivist view
<br>
(simplifying here) of what is _is_ right.  It could be from from a natural
<br>
law perspective, which underlies a lot of different thinkers from Aristotle
<br>
to the Pope.  It could also be from some other standard, such as
<br>
majoritarianism a la Bork, pure formalism a la Kant (who also has a foot in
<br>
the natural law tradition), economic efficiency as many economists do,
<br>
Constitutionalism, or something else.  You can't expect people who believe
<br>
in any of these to be legal positivists.  Again, it's like quoting Scripture
<br>
at the nonbeliever.  (And, as you know, I'm one of the nonbelievers.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I'd be interested to know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether you do or whether Jerry does.
</em><br>
<p>I would argue from the libertarian and Objectivist positions here.
<br>
Basically, killing or abusing people is wrong.  Governments that do such are
<br>
wrong and have no legitimate reason to be.  Laws which support such are
<br>
wrong and need not be obeyed.  In fact, to obey them is often to aid and
<br>
abet the rights violations.  Of course, it depends on the situation one
<br>
finds oneself in.
<br>
<p>(I don't agree with Michael Lorrey here.  Some people are innocent and
<br>
should not be condemned just because they didn't join the partisans or the
<br>
revolution right away.  Others are innocent through ignorance.  Of course,
<br>
some people are Quislings and the like, but my political goal is freedom NOT
<br>
revenge.)
<br>
<p>[One needs] to look into the conceptual foundations of the Law.  If you can't
<br>
do that, then you will be stuck with no way to answer the question.  Ask
<br>
yourself, Why government?  What necessitates government?  Do humans need it?
<br>
If so, what is the best form of government for them?  Are there any forms
<br>
that are bad for them?  There's a whole area known as political philosophy
<br>
(much as Molloy might despise the term) that attempts to answer these
<br>
questions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In what circumstances is the imposition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an obligation by the state legitimate?
</em><br>
<p>You can't impose an obligation.  Obligations are freely entered into or they
<br>
are not obligations but duties or coercions.  But aside from this, the state
<br>
can only [should only] prohibit activities which abrogate individual rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; what is the effect or significance of a law that should have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enacted (or should not have been part of the common law if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes to that)?  How should we respond to such a law?
</em><br>
<p>Any institution evolves.  I would hope that from here on that the law would
<br>
change in the direction of protecting individual rights through objective
<br>
law as defined by Rand in her &quot;The Nature of Government&quot; -- whether it be
<br>
privately or &quot;governmentally&quot; arrived at or enforced.
<br>
<p>My view is [that] individual rights, including those to property, precede
<br>
government, logically, morally, and historically.  If government's only
<br>
legitimate raison d'etre is to protect these rights, then it is illegitimate
<br>
for any government to use force to trample rights.  Taxation is one such
<br>
instance of such trampling.  Ergo, taxation is not legitimate.
<br>
<p>When most people are forced to be part of something or to fund
<br>
something, they tend to become antagonistic toward that something
<br>
or the people involved.  In the case, e.g., of affirmative action,
<br>
a lot of people tend to become more racist, sexist, ethnocentric,
<br>
etc.  At the very least, it arms any irrational prejudices they
<br>
might have.  (See Thomas Sowell's _Preferential Policies: An
<br>
International Perspective_ for many more examples of how such
<br>
policies have destabilized societies around the world, from Sri
<br>
Lanka to the South.)
<br>
<p>With taxation, it should be obvious that people often feel it hurts them --
<br>
because it does!:) -- and also feel animosity toward tax beneficiaries.
<br>
With government in general -- and I mean real world governments -- a lot of
<br>
people come to see this as their means to whatever they want.  Governments
<br>
use force to get what they want.  That's their nature.  So, if people use
<br>
government, it means they are using force against someone else to get what
<br>
they want.
<br>
<p>This applies even if you don't buy the individual rights thing.  After all,
<br>
when you force people to do something, you are generally not going to make
<br>
friends.  One of the worst possible things that can come out of this is not
<br>
that you'll get a bunch of libertarians running you out of the country, but
<br>
that people will come to adopt your ways and also use force to get what they
<br>
want.  This seems the lesson of the last century as governments grew bigger
<br>
and bigger, coming to control more and more aspects of human life.
