<p>
First, on behalf of James and CI, I'd like to thank all those that have
<br>
contributed so far.  Some of the pledges have yet to arive, and we still
<br>
have a considerable way to go, but -- with everyone's help -- we hope to
<br>
make it yet.
<br>
<p>By way of making James Swayze a little better known in the cryonics
<br>
community, a James Swayze web site is now online.  You can visit it at
<br>
<a href="http://www.davidpascal.com/swayze">http://www.davidpascal.com/swayze</a>.  It includes an extensive selection of
<br>
photos, James' posts to Cryonet, examples of his art work, and a number
<br>
of links to his favorite web sites and interests.  So if some of you
<br>
would like to have a look at the face of the fellow we're all rooting for
<br>
and get to know him a bit better, click over.
<br>
<p>Also, as Robert Ettinger also mentioned, CI is now accepting credit card
<br>
payments for donations, via Paypal.  For those who don't know what Paypal
<br>
is, it's a dot-com with over nine million individual and business
<br>
members.  All you need to do is go to <a href="http://www.paypal.com">http://www.paypal.com</a> and register
<br>
-- a very easy process -- and you can send payments to anyone with an
<br>
email address that's also registered.  (Such as The Cryonics Institute. 
<br>
'<a href="mailto:CIHQ@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20SAVING%20JAMES%20SWAYZE%20--%20UPDATE&In-Reply-To=&lt;20010903.233919.-3644929.6.davidpascal@juno.com&gt;">CIHQ@aol.com</a>' should be mentioned as our email address, with 'Cryonics
<br>
Institute' as payee, and you can add a message to the payment, mentioning
<br>
that your donation is for the James Swayze fund.) 
<br>
<p>I might add that Paypal is worth looking into for its own sake.  It
<br>
enables you as an individual to not only make payments but also receive
<br>
them, and it has one of the most secure encryption processes available. 
<br>
So instead of sending your credit card number over the net repeatedly for
<br>
several purchases, with Paypal you only have to register it once,
<br>
securely.  That means that your credit card number will not be given to
<br>
or known by CI or anyone you make a payment to, if you choose to pay via
<br>
Paypal.  Paypal purchases are also insured to a $100,000 limit, and it's
<br>
been favorably reviewed by organizations including Forbes, USA Today, and
<br>
the Wall Street Journal.
<br>
<p>(Needless to say, we are still accepting checks:  just email what you can
<br>
to 'James Swayze Fund', The Cryonics Institute, 24355 Sorrentino Court,
<br>
Clinton Township, Michigan 48035. You'll receive an acknowledgement, of
<br>
course, and all names and amounts will be kept confidential if
<br>
requested.)
<br>
<p><p>Incidentally -- I'm sure all of us would like to help James Swayze, and
<br>
the very best way to do that is by making a donation.  But you can also
<br>
help just by getting the word out.  The problem with raising money on the
<br>
Extopian list is that there are only some three hundred or so subscribers
<br>
to the list, and not all of them read the list every day.  There are
<br>
about a thousand signed-up members of cryonics organizations, and
<br>
thousands more associated with them or interested in cryonics -- but no
<br>
more than a few dozen people might have read the Swayze Fund announcement
<br>
here or on Cryonet and be aware of James Swayze's situation.  Some of
<br>
those few have been very compassionate and generous.  But if hundreds or
<br>
thousands knew instead of dozens, James Swayze's suspension might be
<br>
secure.
<br>
<p>There's an easy solution.  If you know of anyone in the cryonics movement
<br>
who might be interested in helping James Swayze out, but who might not be
<br>
a Extropy list regular, please mention the Swayze Fund the next time you
<br>
happen to talk to them or email them, and ask them to pass the word. It
<br>
doesn't cost a cent, and the more people learn about James and the Fund,
<br>
the better his chances are.  Also, feel free to link to the James Swayze
<br>
web site:  <a href="http://www.davidpascal.com/swayze">http://www.davidpascal.com/swayze</a>.   I'm sure James would be
<br>
glad to return the favor.
<br>
<p>David Pascal
