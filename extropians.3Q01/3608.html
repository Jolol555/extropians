Bull was certainly prescient. I recommend the bio of him, &quot;The Man and
<br>
the Gun&quot; (don't recall the author) to all interested in this very
<br>
interesting Canadian. I recall reading articles in the news back in the
<br>
early 80's about his estate up on the US-Can border, where he controlled
<br>
the only two private border crossings in the world (which the CIA paid
<br>
him to use to funnel artillery ammo to Savimbi's UNITAS movement in
<br>
Angola, fighting against the Cuban and Soviet backed communists, from
<br>
the US through to ships in Montreal.) It was his CIA work that got him
<br>
imprisoned when they refused to acknowledge the fact that his work on
<br>
this was under contract to them. At the time, his estate was an
<br>
artillery firing range, which he used to test his sabot vehicles for
<br>
upper atmosphere/space research work, firing out of surplus 16 inch
<br>
battleship guns, welded end to end. While it was real research, it
<br>
helped cover the CIA arms shipments nicely.
<br>
<p>Here in the US, there is a law against exporting armed artillery shells
<br>
to non-NATO or other allied countries, but nothing against *empty*
<br>
artillery shells being exported. Canada had no law against exporting
<br>
armed shells, so Bull imported surplus US shells, machined them and
<br>
suped them up with some of his customizations, and then exported them
<br>
out of Montreal to Angola, via South Africa.

<em>&gt; Gerald Bull had a vision and an obsession, a vision that led to estrangement from his native Canada, prison in America, and ultimately assassination by Israel. His vision was of an entirely new way to get into space: small rockets boosted by giant guns.
</em><br>
&nbsp;To achieve it he worked for some of the worst regimes on earth: South Africa, China, and ultimately Iraq. His work affected the course of two modern wars and revived the ancient field of artillery.
