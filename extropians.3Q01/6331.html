<p>BOWMAN: Our guest today is Srdja Trifkovic, foreign affairs editor of
<br>
Chronicles--a magazine published by The Rockford Institute. Dr. Trifkovic,
<br>
is there a link between this morning's news that a Russian airliner has been
<br>
hijacked in Turkey--apparently by two Chechens--and the ever escalating
<br>
fighting in the Balkans?
<br>
<p>TRIFKOVIC: The common denominator is Islam. If you look at the map of the
<br>
world, wherever a nation that is historically Muslim meets members of other
<br>
cultures and other religions, whether it's the Catholics in the Philippines,
<br>
Hindus in the Indian Subcontinent, or Orthodox Christians in the Balkans or
<br>
in the Caucasus, you have friction, you have conflict, you have fighting.
<br>
Let's not forget Africa, where you have the bloodiest of all ethnic and
<br>
religious wars--that in southern Sudan, where up to five million Christians
<br>
have been slaughtered over the past decade. In some cases a young nation may
<br>
masquerade as being inspired by religion, whereas it is really driven by the
<br>
19th-century-style national romanticism and the desire to expand. This is
<br>
certainly the case with the Albanians. But we must not overlook the
<br>
inherently expansionist nature of Islam. It is not a &quot;live-and-let-live&quot;
<br>
religion. It is rather peculiar in that it postulates eventual conquest and
<br>
conversion of all non-believers as the duty and obligation of each and every
<br>
Muslim. Even when they talk of &quot;co-existence&quot; it is for tactical reasons
<br>
only, and not as strategic reconciliation with the neighbors who are
<br>
different.
<br>
<p>Q: So what should we do in Kosovo? Withdraw?
<br>
<p>TRIFKOVIC: The involvement of the United States in the Balkans over the past
<br>
decade, that had unfortunately started in the last year of Bush-senior's
<br>
presidency, and then literally got out of control during the dreadful eight
<br>
years of Clinton, had nothing to do with the U.S. national interest, nothing
<br>
to do with peace in the Balkans, and nothing to do with stability in Europe.
<br>
It had everything to do with four different things. One was the desire to
<br>
continue the gradual encirclement of Russia that is always regarded by a
<br>
segment of the decision-making community in Washington as The Enemy. The
<br>
second ingredient was the desire of the Israeli amen-corner to throw the
<br>
Serbs to the Islamic wolves and thus to at least partially atone for more
<br>
than half-a-century of largely uncritical and axiomatic support for Israel
<br>
that came from Washington. The third ingredient was the increasing
<br>
importance of Turkey as the pillar of American regional strategy, and whose
<br>
importance has increased with the discovery of the Caspian oil. One way of
<br>
looking at the U.S. policy in the Balkans is as the Return of the Ottoman
<br>
Empire, and the discovery of the Islamic element there as the ally. In
<br>
Bosnia this was at the expense of the Serbs and Croats. In Kosovo, and in
<br>
what threatens to become the Greater Albania, at the expense of the Serbs,
<br>
Macedonians, and Greeks. The fourth ingredient, last but by no means least,
<br>
is the desire to use the Balkans as some kind of laboratory for
<br>
&quot;multi-ethnic&quot; experimentation. On the one hand the policy-makers say that
<br>
Yugoslavia was untenable because of the allegedly irreconcilable differences
<br>
among its constituent nations; but on the other hand some other multi-multi
<br>
hybrids are deemed eminently desirable and supportable, such as &quot;Bosnia&quot;
<br>
that is really the microcosm of Yugoslavia. There was a skewered
<br>
geopolitical logic in all this. The U.S. policy was deliberately aimed at
<br>
aggravating the situation in the Balkans, and preventing the peace in Bosnia
<br>
when it could have been achieved in 1992. This is a matter of historical
<br>
record, evidenced when the U.S. Ambassador in Belgrade, Warren Zimmerman,
<br>
intervened to sabotage, to torpedo, the agreement reached in Lisbon by the
<br>
European Union under Lord Carrington's chairmanship in February of '92. They
<br>
were driving the Balkan crisis in accordance with their agenda: to create as
<br>
many small, unviable, and inherently unstable entities--the Dayton Bosnia,
<br>
Kosovo under the international protectorate, &quot;independent&quot; Macedonia today
<br>
and &quot;independent&quot; Montenegro tomorrow, and then on to the &quot;autonomous&quot;
<br>
Sanjak, &quot;cantonized&quot; Vojvodina, and so on. These unstable and weak entities
<br>
will have only one thing in common: the demand for the continued presence of
<br>
the United States, of U.S. troops, of U.S. money, and U.S. political
<br>
influence, as the only bedrock of their existence. Everybody out there knows
<br>
that the very moment the so-called international community loses interest in
<br>
that part of the world, Bosnia will fall apart, Kosovo will revert to
<br>
Serbian sovereignty, and things will be very much the way they would have
<br>
been had there been no intervention from Washington. At the moment there isn
<br>
't a single interest the United States has in the Balkans that is worth the
<br>
bones of a single American soldier.
<br>
<p>Q: But on the whole, are you optimistic about the U.S. foreign policy under
<br>
Bush?
<br>
<p>TRIFKOVIC: I am certainly more optimistic than I would have been had the
<br>
alternative prevailed last November. But the battle for Bush's ear is far
<br>
from over. There are some people on his team who give us some cause for
<br>
alarm who belong to the neoconservative cabal within the Administration--in
<br>
particular Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and his deputy Paul Wolfowitz. To
<br>
some extent Dick Cheney has also displayed certain tendencies typical of
<br>
that camp, but I believe that he is more cool-headed. Colin Powell sounds
<br>
and looks every inch a pragmatist, but the problem with him is the lack of a
<br>
fully developed and coherent world outlook; the same applies to Condoleezza
<br>
Rice. What I like about Bush is his essentially nativist skepticism about
<br>
the importance of foreign affairs. Washingtonian pundits like to make jokes
<br>
about his calling Greeks &quot;Grecians&quot; and talking about &quot;East Timoreans.&quot; I
<br>
think this displays a rather healthy disdain for those far-away lands. The
<br>
President who is confused about those potential hotspots where someone else
<br>
might like to send a few squadrons of bombers, is also going to think twice
<br>
whether that is indeed worth doing. My own main concern is that Bush has
<br>
indicated more than once that he is prepared to let the experts run the show
<br>
and tell him what needs to be done abroad. That's why it is important to
<br>
select those experts wisely and to make sure that their world outlook and
<br>
their approach to foreign affairs is rooted in well defined, clearly
<br>
understood and pragmatic, empirically verifiable link between what they are
<br>
doing abroad and what they claim they are doing.
<br>
<p>Q: How about Chronicles--how successful are you in presenting this point of
<br>
view?
<br>
<p>TRIFKOVIC: In terms of the quality of its writing, and in its cultivation of
<br>
the form of elegant and somewhat idiosyncratic essay, it is truly unique. It
<br>
is also unique in its defense of the legacy of our civilization against the
<br>
onslaught of one-worldism, multiculturalism, and political correctitude that
<br>
threaten to destroy all that we hold dear. Some would call Chronicles
<br>
&quot;paleoconservative&quot;--but I don't think that any &quot;ism&quot; adequately describes
<br>
what I would say is the normal, sane outlook. Unless we uphold the value of
<br>
tradition, and of real communities of people who are related to each other
<br>
culturally and even genetically, we are entering the brave new world of
<br>
atomized individuals in which no real culture will be possible, and no
<br>
liberty will be feasible.
<br>
<p>Q: You are staging a panel about Bush's foreign policy at The Rockford
<br>
Institute next Friday. Will these be some of your areas of concern?
<br>
<p>TRIFKOVIC: We will not be philosophizing on the meaning of history and the
<br>
future of the Western civilization. We'll talk about very specific,
<br>
down-to-earth issues, such as the National Missile Defense project, the
<br>
relations with China, Russia, and the European allies, and also some of the
<br>
issues we've discussed earlier, the disengagement from the Balkans--or, more
<br>
precisely, the originally promised disengagement that now seems to be under
<br>
something of a question mark.
<br>
<p>Q: Will you focus on the dangers of the United Nations?
<br>
<p>TRIFKOVIC: The problem is not so much the U.N. per se. It is an inherently
<br>
weak organization, in that it is only as &quot;strong&quot; as the key players want it
<br>
to be. The problem is that the proponents of the One World paradigm, the
<br>
globalists of different colors and persuasions, have used the U.N. as a
<br>
means of building institutions that might ultimately acquire a momentum of
<br>
their own. A prime example is the so-called International Criminal Court,
<br>
the ICC. That's why The Hague Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is such a
<br>
dangerous institution, and such an important precedent. Once you accept the
<br>
principle of trans-national judicial instruments as legal and legitimate,
<br>
you'll end up with international bodies that can override national
<br>
traditions and national sovereignties. Instead of preventing genocide, the
<br>
ICC--if established--will guarantee that those who run the show will be able
<br>
to go around the world bombing people at will, intervening with impunity,
<br>
and having a pseudo-legal cover for whatever they are doing. It is important
<br>
to warn ordinary Americans against such quasi-idealistic projects.
