<em>&gt; It went moderately well, I thought, although a lot of the more vigorous and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inventive discussion between us guests was chopped out for lack of time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert will be entertained to know that I described Matrioshka Brains with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lip-smacking relish, to the revulsion and distress of the token woman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanist (the lovely Dr Gael Jennings). The on-line forum after (with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appearances by Miriam and Russell Blackford [in French disguise]) was what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've come to expect: all manner of technoids sitting at their fucking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers telling us how much Gaia loathes technology and how we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give our all to the Third World, although I didn't see them rushing to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second hand store to sell their filthy machines and mail the proceeds to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Medicine Without Frontiers. One `Diana' informed us that `WE ARE HUMAN...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WE DIE'. I provided suitable directions. This was uncouth of me, I know,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but one grows so weary of this drivel...
</em><br>
<p>i think it went remarkably well, and i missed the first half of the show.  In the
<br>
15 minutes i watched they managed to show two separate 'bits' of Nick Bostrom
<br>
talking, mention transhumanism about twenty times, show a bit of j. lanier,
<br>
and mention posthumanism, uploads, utility fog, matrioshka brains (last couple by
<br>
damien) and lots and lots of nanotech phrase throwing.  the forum was also much
<br>
more supportive than i expected, with lots of people seeming very enthusiastic
<br>
and just a couple of very verbose antitechs (one being the Diana mentioned
<br>
before).  (My main problem with the forum was with the interface, useless for a 
<br>
heavy use forum like that one) My congratulations go to Damien for keeping
<br>
himself under control while Dr Jennings spilt all the typical lose-our-humanity
<br>
drivel.
<br>
