<p><em>&gt; How many of us brave technology advocates, are actually doing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing until the technological magic bullets come online. How many of you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ppl eat plenty of anti-oxidants, fresh fruit and veg, stay away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from foods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with high sodium, and saturated fat content. Exercise regularly, to keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body fat down, and the cardio-vascular system strong, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because lets face it ppl, if we can't keep the old meat sacks we're stuck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in, ticking over until we see some major developments, it's going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kids or grand kids who really benefit from longevity developments.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely; same soapbox as I'm standing on with the Longevity Meme.
<br>
(<a href="http://www.longevitymeme.org">http://www.longevitymeme.org</a>). You should help out -- there's a lot to be
<br>
done, but every contribution helps, no matter how small.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Please lets not have anyone misunderstanding me, am a total advocate of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologically enhanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life spans, and this post is in NO WAY an attack on Doug or his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research. Just interested in how many ppl on the list do more on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level, than hope technology can take up the strain in the future.
</em><br>
<p>More than a few, but nowhere near enough. Again with no offense to Doug (I
<br>
find his work on flies interesting), I think that the best thing that most
<br>
of us can be doing is not research; it's activism. Raising awareness,
<br>
bringing life extension concepts to the mainstream of society and keeping
<br>
them there. That's the way that vast sums of money are attracted to
<br>
research.
<br>
<p>Effective activism requires coordinators and coordination centres. That's
<br>
what I'm working on with the Longevity Meme, and I believe that this is what
<br>
Natasha is working on with Pro-Act. Additionally, people like Russell and
<br>
Damien do their part in the print world through fiction, non-fiction,
<br>
interviews, et al. So a number of us are plugging away at this, but that
<br>
number needs to be larger by a factor of a thousand before we're going to
<br>
get anywhere rapidly.
