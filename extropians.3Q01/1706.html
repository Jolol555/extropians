</em><br>
<p>Well, could be due to the fact that I haven't published a new novel since
<br>
then. :)
<br>
<p>(But TRANSCENSION will be out in February.)
<br>
<p>On the other hand, I'd be disappointed if THE SPIKE isn't to be found in
<br>
most US bookstores. But I very much doubt that Forge (a subset of Tor,
<br>
primarily an sf publisher) have spent a cent in promo, so the book might
<br>
well be lying about in boxes in the warehouse, waiting to be pulped.
<br>
<p>Oh, and there was a rather nice antho of the best Aussie short sf I
<br>
co-edited with David G. Hartwell not long ago, CENTAURUS, but that is an
<br>
expensive hardcover; I haven't heard yet of any plans to bring it out in pb.
<br>
<p>On the fourth hand, an increasing amount of my old-but-readable sf is
<br>
building up at Fictionwise.com, where it'll never go out of
<br>
pay-per-download-print. I hope to be able to announce soonish that they'll
<br>
be doing THE JUDAS MANDALA, the 1982 novel where I, you know, coined the
<br>
term `virtual reality' (but not quite as we know it, Jim).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Its difficult to find Egan and many other more skilled writers. 
</em><br>
<p>That really *is* depressing. Egan, Banks, Macleod, McAuley, Reynolds...
<br>
stax of the most brilliant English-language sf being written today hardly
<br>
raise a ripple in the USA.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Card is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the exception though, he does get shelf space, though generally much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more for his fantasy novels than for his SF.
</em><br>
<p>Scott Card has made the (wobbly, always rescindable) transition into more
<br>
general acceptance. His novel THE LOST BOYS is a quite remarkably effective
<br>
immersive account of life as a Mormon computer programmer, in which the
<br>
dark fantasy/horror element is really just a distraction from the
<br>
naturalistic force of the book.
