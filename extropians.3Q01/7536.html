<p>Ballistic subterranean trains (I've always referred to

them as underground tube trains) is one of my favorite
<br>
ideas, since 1965.  Close to the top of the list.  So
<br>
I'll likely come back again for a more detailed
<br>
treatment.  But for now, a few quick comments.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------------------
<br>
<p>A terrific treatment of this subject, particularly
<br>
regarding the current status of no bull, real world
<br>
implemention, 
<br>
<p>The Evolution of Transport 
<br>
Jesse H. Ausubel and Cesare Marchetti
<br>
<p>&nbsp;can be found at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://phe.rockefeller.edu/TIP_transport/">http://phe.rockefeller.edu/TIP_transport/</a>
<br>
<p>Ausebel and Marchetti are good.  I would further
<br>
recommend their
<br>
<p>Elektron: Electrical Systems in Retrospect and
<br>
Prospect 
<br>
<p>which can be found at:

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------------------
<br>
<p>Getting your propulsion from gravity is a pleasant and
<br>
elegant idea, but an unnecessarily limiting.  Robert's
<br>
obsevation that geothermal energy can be tapped as a
<br>
source of energy is a useful idea, but one should
<br>
consider whether tunneling to a depth where the temp
<br>
is high enough for energy generation is worth the
<br>
problems that result from having the tunnel at so
<br>
elevated a temp.  Perhaps the tunneling technology
<br>
could be used to tap geothermal energy, but I think
<br>
that because of the depth/temperature/pressure
<br>
problem, particularly as it complicates the train
<br>
implementation, that the two challenges--tunnels for
<br>
trains and tunnels for tapping geothermal energy--  
<br>
should be considered separate undertakings.  
<br>
<p>Now consider that the same theory that says you get
<br>
all your gravitational energy back, because the
<br>
operation is frictionless, also allows you to recover
<br>
(linear induction propulsion and then braking with
<br>
superconducting components) a substantial fraction of
<br>
the energy, above and beyond the gravitational
<br>
contribution, that you use for propulsion.  Thus the,
<br>
IMO, most practical arrangement has the trains
<br>
speeding along at a relatively shallow depth.  
<br>
<p>Amara Graps noted in the last treatment of this idea
<br>
that the equations of motion for dropping through the
<br>
earth are equations of simple harmonic motion.  
<br>
<p>Except for a tunnel straight through the axis of the
<br>
planet, or circular at some depth in the equatorial
<br>
plane, there will be side thrusts on the train.  I
<br>
have always depicted such a train as a cylinder of
<br>
circular cross-section in a tube to match.  In this
<br>
configuration, if the train is free to rotate in the
<br>
tube, and the bottom of the train is heavier than the
<br>
top, it will &quot;bank&quot; (rotate in the tube) in response
<br>
to side-thrust.  Thus, as long as the side-thrust does
<br>
not come on too abrubtly, passengers will experience
<br>
what feels exclusively like a downward force.
<br>
<p>Finally, consider that, as you approach orbital
<br>
velocity, the true downward force (not the apparent
<br>
downward force if you're banked in response to side
<br>
thrust) approaches zero, so that except for
<br>
side-thrust you approach weightlessness.  Then as you
<br>
approach excape velocity, the centripital force on the
<br>
train, experienced by the passengers in the inverted
<br>
train as &quot;downward&quot; force, gradually increases until,
<br>
at escape velocity, it is again one g.  Fom one g
<br>
downward at zero mph, gradually diminishing to zero g
<br>
at 17,500 mph, and thence gradually returning to one g
<br>
&quot;downward&quot; (outward actually) at 25,000 mph.
<br>
<p>Fun Stuff.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
