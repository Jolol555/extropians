Joe Dees scorches
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is, on this list, a roaming pack of socioculturally ludditic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservatives poorly disguised as libertarians, who routinely practice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collective rugby scrum pile-on attacks on anyone they suspect might have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly put forward something possessing the slightest whiff of the items 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michael Wiik enumerates.  These are the people who tend to impart a rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-contradictory flavor to what is advertized as a forward-looking list, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are responsible for some progressives feeling that they have to keep their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; membership and participation here a 'dirty little secret', and for some others 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not tarrying long.  Their jihadically intolerant take-no-prisoners blatantly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memebotic scorched-earth warfare pogram has the unfortunate result of skewing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the median, or at least the most vociferously and frequently enunciated, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion of this list to a point somewhere between John Birch and William Pierce.
</em><br>
<p>Oh for heaven's sake, Joe.  In most cases that I've seen, those
<br>
pile-on &quot;attacks&quot; have merely been *many* people expressing their
<br>
take.
<br>
<p>AND TALK ABOUT TAKING NO PRISONERS.  Look at what you wrote, Joe.
<br>
Now honestly,  do you not perceive that---even in the slightest
<br>
way---your criticism could just as easily be directed at your
<br>
own post?   May we not lower the level of denunciation just a
<br>
little *here*---just for a while (I'm not calling for complete
<br>
elimination of denunciation, by any means).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;And Joe Dees believes that soon Eric will be accused of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;a troll.  This is completely incorrect, if not paranoid.  Very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;few people are accused of being trolls, and none are who provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;reasoned discourse (such as Eric is doing).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did not make the statement in question to Eric.  However, I have been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accused, by those trolling for progressives to slander, of trolling for retros 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hand a reaming.  Such sellf-righteous-wing people seem to have a highly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed sense of psychological projection which proves to be rootless with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect to logical coherency or factual reality.
</em><br>
<p>Let's count the emotionally loaded words in this.  (First, you *were*
<br>
warning Eric about the libertarians on this list, I was not in error.)
<br>
Okay.  1 - by those trolling    2 - slander   3 - &quot;sellf-righteous-wing&quot;
<br>
(I think that Joe means right-wing).  And then there is the statement 
<br>
about his adversaries being (or projecting) logical incoherence and
<br>
not being rooted in factual reality.  Your typos would diminish if
<br>
you became less emotional in all of this; you are among friends, I
<br>
assure you.
<br>
<p>(I will omit the part of Joe's post alluding in a sense
<br>
that I did not entirely follow---and didn't attend to 
<br>
very much, I confess---to people mailbombing him off
<br>
some list or other.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;And what the devil is this &quot;accuse&quot; you of being a &quot;socialist&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;That's making it sound as though being a socialist or having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;some socialist beliefs is a necessarily reprehensible view, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;as though criticisms of those with socialist beliefs were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;devoid of real substance (but consisted only name-calling).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I understand what the person was saying even though I did not type the comment; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this particular extremist clique uses words like 'liberal', 'socialist', 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'collectivist', etc., or the more vague yet ominous &quot;I know what you are&quot;, as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if once they invoke these supposed curses, the person to whom they apply or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misapply them is magically discovered, discredited and defeated.
</em><br>
<p>Yes!  Good, right!  I have seen libertarians do exactly what you
<br>
say. They'll effectively dismiss arguments and posters by sentences
<br>
containing such terms *without* supplementing those phrases by 
<br>
rational explanation.  But then, on the other hand, some people
<br>
write things like &quot;socioculturally ludditic conservatives&quot;, etc.
<br>
So, you see, it happens from all quarters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; No one should expect to voice any view that is not subject to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; criticism, and to sometimes powerful, convincing, and yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; embarrassingly accurate criticism.  It's the price that should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be gladly paid in the free exchange of ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At least I am often granted the amusement of receiving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misapplied and ineffectual ad hominem epithets as if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually said something about me rather than about their posters.
</em><br>
<p>Um, sorry.  What is your meaning here?  Did you think that that
<br>
statement was directed at you alone?  (JUST ASKING! No implication!)
<br>
Or were you referring to the general situation where you are
<br>
amused by the name-calling people do to you?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
