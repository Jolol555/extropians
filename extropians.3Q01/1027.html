From: Olga Bourlin
<br>
<em>&gt;Was Bertie intolerant?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;The world at the present day stands in need of two kinds of things. On the
<br>
one hand, organization - political organization for the elimination of wars,
<br>
economic organization to enable men to work productively, especially in the
<br>
countries that have been devastated by war, educational organization to
<br>
generate a sane internationalism. On the other hand it needs certain moral
<br>
qualities the qualities which have been advocated by moralists for many ages,
<br>
but hitherto with little success. The qualities most needed are charity and
<br>
TOLERANCE, not some form of fanatical faith such as is offered to us by the
<br>
various rampant isms. I think these two aims, the organizational and the
<br>
ethical, are closely interwoven; given either the other would soon follow.
<br>
But, in effect, if the world is to move in the right direction it will have to
<br>
move simultaneously in both respects. There will have to be a gradual
<br>
lessening of the evil passions which are the natural aftermath of war, and a
<br>
gradual increase of the organizations by means of which mankind can bring each
<br>
other mutual help. There will have to be a realization at once intellectual
<br>
and moral that we are all one family, and that the happiness of no one branch
<br>
of this family can be built securely upon the ruin of another. At the present
<br>
time, moral defects stand in the way of clear thinking, and muddled thinking
<br>
encourages moral defects. Perhaps, though I scarcely dare to hope it, the
<br>
hydrogen bomb will terrify mankind into sanity and tolerance. If this should
<br>
happen we shall have reason to bless its inventors.&quot;
