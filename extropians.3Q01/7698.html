</em><br>
<p>*Claimed* to be.... That`s the problem. Maybe the US nuclear plants are
<br>
safe, which I cannot believe. German Environment secretary said last week,
<br>
in
<br>
case of a Boeing 747 crash, the containment of Biblis nuclear plant near the
<br>
city of Frankfurt
<br>
might prevent a meltdown, but is not supposed to provide an overall
<br>
protection. German Government always boasted of having built the safest
<br>
nuclear
<br>
plants in the world. And lately built plants do have a concrete shield of
<br>
almost 2 meters and might withstand a plane crash, but Biblis doesn`t seem
<br>
to be safe at all. And it is the most dangerous reactor in the heart of
<br>
Europe
<br>
as far as population density is concerned.
<br>
<p>The attacks on nuclear plants are a serious problem. And obviously no
<br>
Government official has ever thought about an *intentionally initiated*
<br>
plane
<br>
crash. Imagine a Boeing 747, heading from Frankfurt to the USA is going
<br>
to be hijacked and with the full load of fuel is flown at full speed into
<br>
Biblis containment. I bet the concrete shield will not withstand that
<br>
impact.
