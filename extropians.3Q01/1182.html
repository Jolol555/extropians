</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Final Fantasy runs a vary familiar theme well used in Japanese fantasy and
<br>
science fiction films. The earliest that comes to mind is the original
<br>
Godzilla. The monster was metaphorical &quot;force of nature&quot; aroused by the
<br>
arrogance of human destructive capability in the form of nuclear weapons.
<br>
This strikes two very powerful cords to the Japanese mind, first that is
<br>
philosophical and religious tradition, unlike the West's is mystical which
<br>
recognizes a unity between man and nature; the other is that Japan was
<br>
subjected to the only two nuclear weapons used in war (so far).
<br>
<p>I personally enjoyed the movie a great deal and have recommended others to
<br>
see it. The technical prowess and artistic creativity were compelling. As
<br>
for the story, I always have a problem with their plots even with my
<br>
favorite &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; and the Patlabor series. Even still, Japanese
<br>
anime along with their other films provides some insight in how others see
<br>
the world stimulating my ideas and thought. Others obviously don't see
<br>
things in the same way as I believe the objections to the film are really
<br>
ideological. If people &quot;really&quot; watched the film instead of smirking and
<br>
rolling the eyes through out, technology was not the villain. It wasn't even
<br>
about using technology inappropriately in best guess, but erroneous ways. It
<br>
was the application of technology without sensitivity and understanding and
<br>
the unwillingness to change.
<br>
<p>Which brings me to my next question. I hope that someone would make this
<br>
clear for me, is everything environmental Luddite? The Gaia concept I
<br>
believe has been somewhat pushed to the side scientifically as not having
<br>
appropriate tests built within the theory (or due to prejudice), but the
<br>
concept is still valuable if not essential. Life and human beings are an
<br>
emergent phenomena of nature. We do not exist apart. Look at quantum physics
<br>
and chaos theory, both show that everything is connect to everything else.
<br>
If everybody agrees on this basic principal then some should reduce the
<br>
rhetoric (which gets thick on this list) and be more specific about their
<br>
objections. People read these lists other than us (maybe even the
<br>
opposition?) and that should be borne in mind.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Lastly, if we want to relate Final Fantasy to the current effort of the
<br>
Bush administration of building the missile defense system I would say it
<br>
hits the mark.
