<em>&gt;       I have read in a very general way the problems you have in Argentina.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However we also have a slight problem with the terms we use.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       I understand that across the entirety of South America a Conservative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tends to be a guy that owns a big white house on the hill and doesn't intend 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for the people at the bottom of the hill to accumulate any wealth or freedom 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for themselves.  Is that true?  Here Conservative tends to mean something a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;little bit different.  However as I tend to be a libertarian I shan't attempt 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to explain American Conservatives -- I am too close to them.
</em><br>
<p>I believe that was a correct description 100 years ago. It also changes
<br>
a bit from country to country. In Argentina, the political-economical
<br>
group you are thinking of, and that tend to call themselves conservatives
<br>
in the few times they actually bother with standard politics instead of
<br>
calling the army or beating the economy to show their displeasure, would be:
<br>
<p>-big landowners, whose income comes from agriculture/meat exports
<br>
-usually from &quot;old families&quot; (pre 1880 immigration, the older the best)
<br>
-deeply catholic
<br>
-very aristocratic and elitist
<br>
-believers in the &quot;inherent flawed nature&quot; of the rest of the population,
<br>
&nbsp;to the point that shamelessly racist babble about &quot;weak blood&quot; in the
<br>
&nbsp;late-immigrant or mestizo-originating lower classes is the reason the country
<br>
&nbsp;never reached its &quot;glory&quot; (whatever the blazes that could be)
<br>
-authoritarian, oligopolist
<br>
<p>C.
