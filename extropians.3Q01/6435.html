<p>I really don't think that's what's going on.  I think the US is hated
<br>
because it acts like the world's only superpower can get away with
<br>
anything, bombs everyone in sight at the drop of the pin but screams
<br>
bloody murder when anyone dares even think about touching its own sacred
<br>
soil, does not even pretend to respect the sovereignty of other nations,
<br>
and in general purports to act as the world's police officer while being
<br>
completely unaccountable to any other nation and/or the UN.  That's how
<br>
they see us, and I think they're more or less right.
<br>
<p>I also think that the US must, for the sake of the world, go on acting as
<br>
the world's police officer; that the US has never stopped caring about
<br>
minimizing the fatality count; and that the US has abused its
<br>
unaccountability less than any other powerful country or organization in
<br>
the history of the world.  But even so, if you decide to police the world,
<br>
then you have to expect that a certain number of your buildings are going
<br>
to get blown up; just as a nation that chooses to establish its eternal
<br>
religious homeland on the most fought-over piece of ground on the entire
<br>
planet, instead of someplace sensible like Canada, has to expect a few
<br>
terrorist attacks.
<br>
<p>And there is nothing we can do to stop those terrorist attacks, not if we
<br>
send a billion troops and spend a trillion dollars - just as a
<br>
nation-state the US chooses to chastise has no realistic way of
<br>
counterinvading or even harming us in the slightest.  The terrorist
<br>
attacks are stupid and futile and harm only the innocent, and there is
<br>
nothing we can realistically do to stop them.  Bombing some country whose
<br>
government has offended us is stupid and futile and harms only the
<br>
innocent, and there is nothing they can realistically do to stop us.  I
<br>
guess it goes to show that you can create symmetry without creating
<br>
justice.
