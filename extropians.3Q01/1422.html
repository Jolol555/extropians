Eliezer said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;I think that calling for 'a deep respect for life in all its forms' is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;high-sounding but empty statement that dodges all the real moral issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You don't say what 'disrespect' is, or why, or explain how disrespect is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the proper subject of government legislation; you simply look at a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technology, experience future shock, say 'eeeww', and regard this as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sufficient cause to ban medical research that could save thousands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lives.  Whether using a stem cell embryo to cure Parkinsons is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'disrespectful', i.e., 'morally unacceptable', is not a take-home issue;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is the whole of the argument.  Every advance in medical technology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from smallpox vaccines to pacemakers, seems strange to someone.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't prove that 'disrespect' is a nonissue, but it does demonstrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that it takes more to establish moral horror than someone saying 'eeeww'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Myself, I don't think a stem cell embryo is a human being any more than an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unfertilized egg cell is a human being or a two-by-four is a finished
</em><br>
<em>&gt;house.  I don't see how a stem cell embryo could possibly count as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sentient being when it takes until the second trimester of pregnancy for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fetus's neurons to even begin forming synapses.  I understand that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people may feel differently, but I don't think that feeling has enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;basis in fact to direct the course of medical research.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Thanks. Your thoughts are always useful to have, Eliezer. As you'd 
<br>
appreciate, we've already been debating some of these issues, such as &quot;what 
<br>
is respect?&quot; Basically, your views and mine are exactly congruent. I don't 
<br>
think I'll use the expression &quot;eeeww&quot;  :-) but I will take your formulation 
<br>
into account as I work on the piece over the next few days.
<br>
<p>Thanks also to those I heard from - Reason, Olga, Mark, Damien (hope I 
<br>
didn't forget anyone - about  being willing to have a look at what I write. 
<br>
You'll all hear from me soon.
<br>
<p>For my part, I'm always prepared to reciprocate and give views on this kind 
<br>
of material if anyone wants to run drafts past me.
<br>
<p>Russell
