</em><br>
<p>Well, I guess the upsides are what make some politicians so eager to
<br>
propose it. But notice the word &quot;volunteer&quot;. As far as I have understood
<br>
these ideas - they are seldom stated clearly, just something floating
<br>
around nobody wants (yet) to propose - this implies more or less
<br>
&quot;unpaid&quot;. After all, they have their pensions. So that implies a health
<br>
care system (it is especially in this respect it is mentioned) that
<br>
would become dependent on healthy older volunteers. I wonder what the
<br>
nurses say about that. And what if too few volunteer? Well, in that case
<br>
the idea seems to be to appeal to their &quot;solidarity&quot;, i.e. *make* them
<br>
volunteer. Of course, nobody says that, but whenever this question is
<br>
asked by rude libertarian transhumanists like me the word &quot;solidarity&quot;
<br>
is mentioned with the special Swedish intonation suggesting &quot;must help&quot;
<br>
rather than &quot;want to help&quot;. :-(
<br>
<p>Personally I think having a lot of older people around might help start
<br>
up new companies - quite a few people seem to see their retirement as a
<br>
chance to start doing what they like, like starting a business that they
<br>
have always wanted to try. It might be that it could create the security
<br>
needed for quite a bit of innovative enterprises (assuming the strong
<br>
legal/taxation/economic disincentives for small businesses in Sweden can
<br>
be changed; this is what I hope the increasing group of grey politicians
<br>
might actually help with).
