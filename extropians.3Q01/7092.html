Subject: The New War-ld Order - America's New War
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The New War-ld Order -  America's New War
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By Richard Sauder, PhD
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose it was inevitable that the New World Order would turn out to
<br>
actually be the &quot;New  War-ld Order&quot;. And that George Bush, Jr. would promote
<br>
himself to be War-ld Leader.       Lord help us.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to underscore at the outset that it goes without saying that the
<br>
assault on the World  Trade Center was horrific. As I watched the plane slam
<br>
into the tower, people jumping to  their death from hundreds of feet up, and
<br>
then both of the towers crumbling, I found myself  saying, &quot;How bizarre.&quot;
<br>
And then, &quot;My God. Thousands of people just died.&quot; I was rendered
<br>
speechless. The event was so far out of my experience that I watched it in
<br>
numb disbelief.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbness persists. But in this novocaine-like numbness several
<br>
thoughts have kept  coming to the fore of my mind. Let me set them out for
<br>
you. I ask that you reflect on them  soberly. I believe you may see some
<br>
truth in what I say -- perhaps a great deal more truth  than in the
<br>
so-called &quot;official&quot; pronouncements you hear and see in the major news media
<br>
outlets these last few days.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) This was an extremely sophisticated operation. More than one observer
<br>
has mentioned its  almost military efficiency --as if it had the backing of
<br>
a well-oiled intelligence machine  behind it. My question: was a well-oiled
<br>
intelligence machine behind it? Are we seeing a  massive intelligence
<br>
operation, with considerable resources behind it? Are we really to  believe
<br>
that one man in a turban on the other side of the planet is the major
<br>
driving force  behind this? Or might the source of this very sophisticated
<br>
conspiracy lie much closer to  home, right in the United States itself? As I
<br>
recall, bin Laden got his start as an indirect (or  was it direct?)
<br>
CIA-asset, as a mujahadin warrior fighting against the Soviet Army during
<br>
their abortive 10-year invasion of Afghanistan. Question: is bin Laden still
<br>
a CIA-asset  today? Does the CIA use him and his followers as a mercenary
<br>
force on &quot;cut-out&quot; operations  where they need &quot;plausible deniability&quot;? Like
<br>
say, for a massive, staged-for-TV terrorist  operation on American soil?
<br>
Don't lash out at me for posing the question. THINK.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) I have read that the plane that struck the Pentagon first flew
<br>
toward/near/over the White  House, before veering away and over the Potomac
<br>
to the Pentagon. The White House has  defenses for PRECISELY this type of
<br>
event. Why were they not activated? Was the plane  expected? Or did it
<br>
receive other, um, flight instructions en route? THINK.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The White House issued a statement saying that there was &quot;credible
<br>
evidence&quot; that the  hijackers had access to secret codes and information
<br>
concerning the presidential jet, Air  Force One, such that George Bush, Jr.
<br>
fled first to Louisiana and then to Nebraska, before  returning to
<br>
Washington, DC at the end of the day. If this statement is true, then that
<br>
presupposes that this attack may have roots that extend into the most secret
<br>
levels of the  Executive branch of the United States government. Those codes
<br>
are very closely held. I  don't have them and neither do you. Yet we have
<br>
been led to believe by the Bush White  House that the hijackers somehow may
<br>
have had them. How is this possible? Could the  conspiracy extend into the
<br>
Federal Government itself? (It occurs to me that the White  House's
<br>
assertion that the hijackers had access to TOP SECRET codes might also be
<br>
false, in  order to make George Jr.'s day on the run appear less, shall we
<br>
say, cowardly, and more, er,  presidential. If so that would then call the
<br>
truthfulness of other statements and  pronouncements made that same day into
<br>
question. So -- we are ineluctably faced either with  deceit and lies by the
<br>
White House, or with a conspiracy that may reach very deep indeed  into the
<br>
United States government itself-- or maybe both!) THINK.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Are we looking at some kind of coup d'etat in progress? Look at the
<br>
two major targets  that were hit: the nerve center of the American military
<br>
(The Pentagon) and the nerve center  of the American economy (Lower
<br>
Manhattan). You know, in many other countries, if the  national military
<br>
headquarters and major financial centers were massively bombed at the  same
<br>
time it would be instantly understood that there was possibly a coup d'etat
<br>
underway,  with rival factions within the military and the business elite
<br>
vying for control. But not in the  USA. Nope. This is the land of the
<br>
&quot;lone-nut-conspiracy&quot;. Where any complex matter, no  matter how intricate
<br>
and sophisticated it may be gets reduced to &quot;one lone nut&quot;. It usually
<br>
takes only a matter of hours. And, yep, sure enough: one lone nut. Osama bin
<br>
Laden. But  not just any lone nut, this bin Laden character. No, he happens
<br>
to have had indirect (or  were/are they direct?) ties to the CIA. Hmmm.
<br>
Let's see÷ Lee Harvey Oswald also had ties  to the CIA. You don't suppose
<br>
that could just be a coincidence, now do you?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) One day when I was doing my graduate studies one of my professors who
<br>
worked for the  CIA told me, &quot;Earlier in my career, I used to help overthrow
<br>
governments.&quot; I am sure he  told the truth. This is what the CIA has been
<br>
doing for decades. In Guatemala, Iran, Chile÷  the list continues. You know
<br>
how the old saying goes: &quot;Practice makes perfect.&quot; THINK.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) Usually when a coup d'etat (or attempted coup d'etat) occurs you will
<br>
see certain kinds of  actions take place. Daily life will be disrupted.
<br>
There will be troops and armored personnel  carriers in the Capital city
<br>
immediately afterward. This happened in Washington, DC. There  will be a
<br>
security crack-down with increased police surveillance and arbitrary arrest
<br>
and  detention. Sure enough, just yesterday, I read that the FBI has
<br>
increased its surveillance of  the internet, and that the U.S. Senate has
<br>
voted to increase federal telephone tapping  authority. Also, the news has
<br>
been full of stories of people being arrested and detained here  and there
<br>
around the country-- usually men of Middle Eastern, Muslim or Arab ancestry
<br>
or  origin. (One is reminded somewhat of the scapegoating of Jews in the
<br>
Third Reich.) There  will also be restrictions on free movement. We also
<br>
have seen this in the present confusion,  with restrictions on air travel
<br>
and the searches and arrest of passengers on Amtrak. All of  this is done in
<br>
the name of greater security and safety. But what if the foxes are within
<br>
the  flock, and not without? What is occurring has a very strange feel to
<br>
it. THINK.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7) Everywhere I go I see flags. I read of a crowd of workers at the
<br>
World Trade Center  spontaneously chanting &quot;USA, USA, USA, USA&quot; in unison
<br>
when Bush visited. And I  thought: this Bush man will lead these Unthinking
<br>
American Sheeple to their  uncomprehending deaths. And most astonishingly of
<br>
all: in their thousands they will go  willingly, never understanding how
<br>
they are manipulated and led to the slaughter.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8) It reminds me that one of the techniques the CIA-mind controllers
<br>
used in the MK-Ultra  mind control program was called &quot;psychic driving&quot;. It
<br>
turns out that if you induce massive  emotional trauma into the human psyche
<br>
that it makes it highly suggestible and mentally  programmable. That is, you
<br>
shatter the normal psyche with emotional trauma and while it is  in a
<br>
vulnerable, shattered condition you insert the new mental program you want
<br>
the person  to embody and carry out. When the psyche recovers from the
<br>
trauma, when the psyche  establishes a new emotional equilibrium, it is,
<br>
however, radically changed: it has  incorporated the new thoughts, the new
<br>
way of thinking and acting that the mind controller  presented to it when it
<br>
was shattered. When it reconstitutes itself it incorporates the mind
<br>
control program as part of its emotional/psychological/mental constitution.
<br>
I suggest that we  are seeing a massive mind control operation to insert a
<br>
WAR program into the hearts and  souls of Americans and as much of the rest
<br>
of the world as possible. THINK.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9) For all of the foregoing reasons and more I want to say just as
<br>
plainly and publicly as I  can that I am OPPOSED to this coming war. It
<br>
cannot possibly have a good result. To  avenge 5,000 victims (or 20,000?)
<br>
America may very well kill even more, perhaps a great  deal more, many of
<br>
whom will be just as innocent as the victims of last week's attacks. I  have
<br>
read that the Pentagon will employ its entire arsenal in the coming
<br>
conflict. That is  sobering. That would include everything, up to and
<br>
including, nuclear weapons. If the USA  uses nuclear weapons, can anyone
<br>
reading this doubt that those against whom they are used  will strike back
<br>
in return? And if an American city is nuked-- what then? Does the Pentagon
<br>
then nuke back in return? And if so, do those who are nuked, nuke America
<br>
yet again? And  so forth÷. where would it end? THINK.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10) I am deeply troubled by the anti-Arab, anti-Muslim hysteria of
<br>
recent days. I have read  of attacks against mosques and harassment of Arabs
<br>
and Muslims in the streets. Remember  the NAZIs' Kristallnacht? Where the
<br>
German people went on a rampage against Jews and  their synagogues in the
<br>
run-up to World War II? Must we behave like the NAZIs did? I  would suggest
<br>
that such behavior is profoundly un-American. Let me say that over the years
<br>
I have known several Arabs and Muslims. They were my friends and associates,
<br>
and I liked  them. I even studied Arabic for one year. I submit that we need
<br>
greater understanding of the  Arabic and Muslim worlds -- not less. Perhaps
<br>
if we understood more, we would hate less.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11) Chickens coming home to roost. See Point 5 above. The CIA and the
<br>
Pentagon have  violently intervened, directly and indirectly, all over the
<br>
world, time and time again. The  aggregate civilian casualties run to the
<br>
MILLIONS. Here is just a partial list: Guatemala,  Panama, Chile, Colombia,
<br>
El Salvador, Nicaragua, Haiti, Grenada, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos,  Cambodia,
<br>
Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Angola, Liberia, Serbia, Kosovo ÷. and
<br>
the  list keeps on going and going. If America thought it could just send in
<br>
the Marines, send in  the CIA-covert operations guys and assassination teams
<br>
and stomp on the peasantry here --  and there -- and everywhere -- and no
<br>
one would ever strike back-- well, that simple-minded  delusion may have
<br>
just ended with a very big bang in New York.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12) And would the CIA and others, like the ultra-rich Bush family and
<br>
its Big Oil cronies  and World Bank friends, who want to impose a fascist
<br>
global order, play off violent factions  in the Arab and Muslim world
<br>
against the civilian population in America in order to  annihilate the
<br>
first, while further enslaving the second? DUH! -- Do yah think maybe?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13) Enslaving the population of America. In the headlines recently: A)
<br>
Increased telephone  wire tapping by the FBI. B) Increased surveillance of
<br>
the internet and e-mail by the FBI's  CARNIVORE program. C) Prominent
<br>
arrests and detentions of travelers on trains and  planes-- some are
<br>
released; others are held. Will you be next? Are you sure about that? D)
<br>
Politicians talking about giving up some of the freedoms we have become used
<br>
to in order to  have greater security-- presumably things like the 4th
<br>
Amendment-- the right to be secure  from police intrusion, harassment, and
<br>
surveillance within the sphere of our personal lives  and homes? E)
<br>
Increased use of biometric identification by banks, airports and government
<br>
bureaucracies-- retina scans, palm print scans, digitized photo data banks
<br>
used by  crowd-scanning cameras. F) Massive surveillance of global
<br>
electronic communications by  the NSA's ECHELON program.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. Society itself is now a huge open air prison and we are all
<br>
inmates in the &quot;Federal  Penitentiary&quot;. Don't lash out at me for stating the
<br>
plain facts. Just please THINK.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to George Bush, Jr. on the radio. He talked about &quot;ridding
<br>
the world of evil&quot;. And  in the instant that he said those words I
<br>
understood the depths of the danger that we all face,  because I understood
<br>
that this man has a huge messiah complex. He has a classic &quot;big  man-little
<br>
man&quot; psychological profile and he's out to save the world from &quot;evil&quot;. And
<br>
that is  dangerous, very dangerous indeed. Because he and other political
<br>
and military figures have  plainly said that they will unleash the massive
<br>
force of the Pentagon's huge arsenal in a  global campaign against terrorism
<br>
that will be wide ranging and long term. The better to  defend America's
<br>
cherished &quot;freedom&quot; and protect America against further harm. The war  will
<br>
be prosecuted relentlessly, at home and abroad. Who precisely are the
<br>
&quot;enemies&quot;? Well,  we haven't exactly been told that just yet.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But &quot;they&quot; are out there and also right &quot;here&quot; in America!-- dangerous,
<br>
amorphous, hard to  identify, slippery, cunning. Perhaps even your next door
<br>
neighbor! Gasp! (Will the federal  cops start kicking in doors at 3:00am
<br>
like the Gestapo used to do during the Third Reich-- to  apprehend alleged
<br>
&quot;enemies&quot; of the state in their pajamas?) So the U.S. government has  made
<br>
something like a declaration of war -- open-ended, ongoing, with an initial
<br>
$40 billion  slush fund to wage it. And the war has already started-- there
<br>
is already an adversary, even  if no one can yet say with precision just who
<br>
the &quot;enemy&quot; is.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there is every possibility that in George Bush, Jr.'s crusade
<br>
to &quot;rid the world of  evil&quot; that he just may end up unleashing even more
<br>
evil, both overseas and in the United  States of America. So I am OPPOSED to
<br>
this &quot;New War-ld Order&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is the piddling little matter that when &quot;Jr.&quot; was faced
<br>
with his first Presidential  crisis his first instinct was to run and
<br>
run...as fast and as far as his official airplane could  carry him...he ran
<br>
first to Louisiana...and then he ran some more to Nebraska...and then he
<br>
came slinking home at the end of the day. Translation: when the sloppy stuff
<br>
hits the fan, he  and other (so-called) &quot;leaders&quot; will scurry to their
<br>
underground bunkers and surround  themselves with their Praetorian guards
<br>
and leave you to face the violence all alone with  your bare hands.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your (so-called) government hard at work.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Please THINK.
