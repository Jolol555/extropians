<p>It is not hard to debunk religion to religious people -- it is impossible.
<br>
Another tack is required.

<p>I actually think that is the answer. Storytelling. Fight meme with meme.
<br>
<p>The VR story I am working on at the moment is actually one of a series. One 
<br>
of the later episodes concerns a woman who programs a virtual world which 
<br>
she populates with artificial life. The creatures in the computer develop 
<br>
intelligence and consciousness with the help of a bit of unnatural 
<br>
selection that she designs. However when she returns to look in on the 
<br>
experiment after a while she is dismayed to find that the creatures have 
<br>
developed a rather strict and fundamentalist religion which requires that 
<br>
they all worship their creator.
<br>
<p>She is very embarrassed by this so she makes an appearance to them as an 
<br>
avatar to ask them to be kinder to each other and to point out how 
<br>
insulting to her such religions are. She tries to tell them that she is not 
<br>
so small-minded and insecure as to want them to worship her. All she wants 
<br>
is for them to live happy lives. Sadly this has the opposite effect to what 
<br>
she intended. The priests condemn her as a blasphemer and try to have her 
<br>
'cleansed' (destroyed). One of the creatures that she had chatted with 
<br>
about morality and commonsense ends up being ritually impaled on a spike 
<br>
tree after he tries to talk sense to people.
<br>
<p>At this point she becomes quite disgusted and has nothing further to do 
<br>
with such revolting creatures. She considers deleting the virtual world and 
<br>
re-starting the program, but refrains when she realises with interest that 
<br>
increasing numbers of atheistic creatures are living &quot;good&quot; lives. She 
<br>
leaves the experiment to run its own course -- she might look in on it 
<br>
again sometime in the distant future.
<br>
<p>------------
<br>
<p>You can argue with religious people until you are blue in the face and get 
<br>
nowhere, but if you can use a story to help them understand how insulting 
<br>
religion would be to a god if it did exist, then maybe you have the 
<br>
beginning of change.
<br>
<p>Anybody who feels like writing it as a script for the episode, be my guest. 
<br>
I won't be able to pay anything unless the technology proves itself and I 
<br>
can sell the shows. I was intending to write most of this stuff myself, but 
<br>
I am not really a great writer... Damien? Russell? Otherwise I shall just 
<br>
do as originally intended.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
