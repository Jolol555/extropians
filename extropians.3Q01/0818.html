Robin, commenting on Amara's comments wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A thoughtful and unusually clear explanation. But to me the key 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question is: is it *true*? People have such a strong need to belief 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such things that one must worry that they see it even when it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not there. Is Amara's strong acceptance of the events around her 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best explained by her unconsciously arranging those events to give 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her what she needs, or by her unconsciously deciding after the fact 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that whatever happened must have been what she needed? 
</em><br>
<p>To deal with the question of &quot;is it *true*&quot; one has to deal
<br>
with the question of the &quot;frame of reference&quot;.  There are
<br>
three realities:
<br>
(a) The reality of ones personal experience.  If you have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;experienced&quot; it, it is &quot;true&quot; in ones personal reality
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to contradict that is very difficult.  Thus we have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people who know &quot;What is the sound of one hand clapping&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as well as &quot;What does it feel like to be impregnated by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an alien&quot;.
<br>
(b) The reality of shared experiences.  I.e. we all collectively
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experience &quot;gravity&quot; in the same way, so we discourage
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most people from the belief that they are able to overcome
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gravity by &quot;flying&quot;.  Most of us may have tried flying
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(in our childhoods), it didn't work, perhaps with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negative consequences as some list members can attest,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so we discourage the pursuit of such &quot;unrealitles&quot; by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attempting personal flight.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously politics &amp; religion fall someplace between (b) and (a).
<br>
<p>(c) The physical reality.  I.e. electron repulsion between
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all physical materials and the radiation bath which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we all experience.  Our physical senses are poorly designed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to deal with most of this reality, and so we only experience
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it indirectly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To me one of the great tragedies of the human condition is that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; young largely ignore advice from the old. 
</em><br>
<p>This is easily explained by the problem that one cannot transmit
<br>
(with full emotional impact) the realizations associated with
<br>
personal experiences, e.g. (a).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another tragedy is that people are overconfident in their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wisdom relative to that of other people. 
</em><br>
<p>If you are &quot;alive&quot;, your own wisdom has proved itself to be a
<br>
&quot;reliable&quot; guide.  One has no certainty that the acceptance of
<br>
other's wisdom would be so successful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the smell of garlic? I fear that seeing great wisdom in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is most likely wishful thinking. 
</em><br>
<p>Not so.  I believe garlic has recently been shown to be a metal
<br>
chelator.  If so, it should have health promoting effects.  The
<br>
&quot;wisdom&quot; here may be simply cultural wisdom passed from generation
<br>
to generation as a result of the better health of ones ancestors.
<br>
<p>It will be very interesting to learn whether or not there are
<br>
&quot;real&quot; receptors that sense and/or respond to garlic.  If so,
<br>
that wisdom will have made the transition from folklore into
<br>
the hardware.
