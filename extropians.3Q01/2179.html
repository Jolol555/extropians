<p>It took a decade and a couple of three billion dollars to find the first

human genome but it looks like this field is also following Moore's Law.
<br>
In today's New York Times Craig Venter the head of Celera had this to say:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot; At the end of this year we will be able to sequence the genes and
<br>
regulatory
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regions in any individual in less than a week and for under one million
<br>
dollars.&quot;
<br>
<p>It would be sort of fun to have your own personal genome on your hard drive,
<br>
there is so much redundancy that if you turned it into a zip file it would
<br>
be
<br>
smaller than Microsoft Word.
<br>
<p>### Actually, in a few years it might be possible to use Affymetrix
<br>
resequencing gene chips to sequence not only the genes and regulatory
<br>
regions mentioned by Venter but the whole genome (except repeats), for a few
<br>
thousands of dollars (that is, the labor involved in sequencing and chip
<br>
manufacture could be bought for that - the market price might be initially
<br>
much higher).
<br>
<p>Affymetrix formed Perlegen, a subsidiary aiming to resequence 100 persons
<br>
for less than 10x8 $. Currently they have to use 200 to 300 chips per genome
<br>
but eventually you might have just one chip for the whole sequence.
