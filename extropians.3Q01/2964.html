<em>&gt; &gt; That is an interesting take on MS's dangerously insecure operating systems.

<em>&gt; &gt; I had simply thought it was more of this, printed in The Age (a reputable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Australian Newspaper) early last year:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; US secret agents work at Microsoft: French intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Source: AFP | Published: Saturday February 19, 7:44 AM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; PARIS, Feb 18 - A French intelligence report today accused US secret agents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of working with computer giant Microsoft to develop software allowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Washington to spy on communications around the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The French have reason to be paranoid.  Several years ago, there were a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple moderately well-known cases where French government backdoor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shenanigans in international negotiations were manipulated and/or exposed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US government.  It was eventually figured out by the French government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that many of the American commercial hardware and software products they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were using had been monkeyed by the US intelligence services to monitor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign governmental activities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, the French had it coming.  For many years now, the French have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; held the title of being the number one perpetrator of espionage against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US, usually in close competition with China for the title.  What many people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know, is that the US was deporting *hundreds* of French spies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annually, or at least in the early 90's when I had a working knowledge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this.
</em><br>
<p>I had heard about this, they were primarily dealing in industrial
<br>
espionage, but not exclusively. When the TWA 800 flight went down, and
<br>
there were all the theories about it being shot down, I figured it must
<br>
have had a french spy or two on it that the US absolutely, positively
<br>
didn't want to make it home...
<br>
<p>Frankly, besides the Chinese, the French are the second biggest foreign
<br>
policy annoyances in the world today. Not just their espionage, but
<br>
their manipulation of the US justice system by extortion over the
<br>
extradition of heinous killers like Einhorn and Kopp, as well as their
<br>
sabotage of the language of various international treaties which demands
<br>
the surrender of the sovereign rights of americans, which the present US
<br>
administration has the guts to stand up against (the UN Conference on
<br>
Small Arms), or which is poisoned with anti-jew language (like the
<br>
ironically named Conference on Racism, which Colin Powell is refusing to
<br>
sign unless the anti-jew language is removed).
