<br>
<p><em>&gt;This definition ,of capitalism&gt; is not very useful without definitions for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;private
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decision&quot; and &quot;state control.&quot;  Clearly, this definition assumes that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;practice of capitalism is consistent within the jurisdiction of a political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;state, since the definition includes ownership of capital goods by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corporations, which are creations of the state.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly so, which is why I keep querying whether a pure libertarian 
<br>
political philosophy can allow for *corporate* capitalism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Although the distinction between state and corporation is clear where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corporation is very small (in terms of resources controlled) relative to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;state, the distinction becomes much less clear when corporations are as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;large or larger than the state under whose laws they're registered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Minarchism&quot; might be a more useful term than &quot;capitalism,&quot; but I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that even minarchists would allow the existence of corporations.
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, I'm not sure they all do. I can't verify this quickly, but I think 
<br>
you'll find that Mike Lorrey is not the only libertarian thinker who reasons 
<br>
that corporations can't be allowed coz there is no justification for the 
<br>
state to have the power to bequeath corporate privileges on trading 
<br>
associations (Mike: I *assume* that is what you were saying is essentially 
<br>
your position; correct me if I've misread you).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It would probably be useful to examine the various characteristics of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corporations (perpetual existence, limited liability, management separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from ownership, etc.) to see which of these tend to undermine truly free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;markets.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm not sure what it means to say that they &quot;undermine free markets&quot;. 
<br>
They have the effect though, that the market becomes one involving these 
<br>
legally fictionally entities as players, and this has various disadvantages.
<br>
<p>However, it also has the advantage of facilitating large accumulations of 
<br>
private wealth, which (admittedly) has disadvantages of its own but seems to 
<br>
be good for economic growth and technological progress. I say &quot;seems&quot; 
<br>
because I've not come across any literature that tries to analyse the likely 
<br>
economic and technological effects of forcing trading associations to 
<br>
operate essentially as partnerships, with individuals having liability for 
<br>
debts etc - ie associations with none of the characteristics of corporations 
<br>
that you mentioned. I'd be interested if anyone on the list knows something 
<br>
about this.
