<p><em>&gt;&gt; From dictionary.com:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;   rac·ism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;   n.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     1. The belief that race accounts for differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        in human character or ability and that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        particular race is superior to others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     2. Discrimination or prejudice based on race.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; How does one tell the difference between &quot;people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discriminate based on the cultural attributes of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large cross-section of blacks&quot; and those that &quot;discriminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blacks from whites because they believe that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetically superior&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>It is up to the speaker or writer in either case.  Because
<br>
genuine misunderstanding (mis-reading of what another person
<br>
really wants to say) on this issue is SO PREVALENT, writers
<br>
and speakers *must* be clear.
<br>
<p>Sadly, Jerry, according to your meaning (as I read it) I
<br>
myself am racist, because I believe that it's possible,
<br>
even likely, that different groups *genetically* differ
<br>
*statistically* along some very important axes.  As I
<br>
said before, it is entirely possible that California
<br>
Asian children are statistically as much smarter than
<br>
whites, as statistically whites are smarter than any
<br>
other group you care to mention, or more so, and that
<br>
some of these differences may indeed be genetic (due
<br>
to historical or other factors, and would be easily
<br>
correctable within *any* group by eugenics).  Please,
<br>
everyone:  if you want to blast me for that, start
<br>
another thread.  Don't use this one.  This is about
<br>
meanings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does the term racist apply to both?  If so, then nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative at all can ever be said of &quot;blacks&quot; statistically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;i.e. black cops that use racial profiling&quot; without being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labeled racist (neat trick for a black cop to be racist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of blacks).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, &quot;racist&quot; surely does not apply to both of your categories.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is the big reason I think that a large number of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't want others looking this closely at definitions, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not in the interest of the PC crowd to clarify the issues.
</em><br>
<p>You can't over-characterize them all that way!  Some people
<br>
who would even own up to being &quot;PC&quot; would vigorously deny
<br>
that accusation; and some of *those* would be very right!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My vote is to scrap definition #2 because it confuses this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue beyond need and I think number 1 handles the definition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just fine. Occam's razor and all....
</em><br>
<p>Pre-judging people, and sticking with that pre-judgment despite
<br>
the evidence, is to me an important part of what ought to be
<br>
meant by &quot;racist&quot;.  Therefore, I agree that something like the
<br>
second meaning should still be accepted.
<br>
