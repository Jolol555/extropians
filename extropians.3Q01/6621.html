I ran across this URL:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.servtech.com/~grugyn/afgh-01.htm">http://www.servtech.com/~grugyn/afgh-01.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Obviously a somewhat inflamatory document, but discusses
<br>
the fact that our &quot;war on terrorism&quot; may be 3+ years old
<br>
and the fact that annual terrorist activities have been
<br>
impacting people in numbers that are of the same order of
<br>
magnitude of those who may have died this week (i.e. this
<br>
is nothing new).
<br>
<p>Why does it take a &quot;dramatic&quot; act to call our attention to
<br>
and galvanize a response to such atrocities?
<br>
<p>I am reminded of a perspective developed by the Hunger Project
<br>
almost 20 years ago -- it pointed out that the number of people
<br>
who die from starvation around the world annually is equivalent
<br>
to a 747 full of people crashing into a mountain *every* hour.
<br>
<p>I think Brian may have pointed out to me recemtly, my Sysopish
<br>
perspective that one needs to prevent the unnecessary loss of
<br>
life.  It is an extraordinarly difficult perspective -- to allow
<br>
the exercise of individual freedom and at the same time preserve
<br>
to the greatest extent the information content of the civilizations
<br>
that currently exist that troubles me.  
<br>
<p>Another way to look at this is that &quot;blind belief&quot; is unextropic.
<br>
So extropians should celebrate the extinction of blind believers.
<br>
This would seem to indicate that in the long term, any actions
<br>
that promote the development of constructed, integrated, information
<br>
producing perspectives is good, while their destruction is bad.
<br>
<p>However, one has to be careful in determining whether &quot;blind belief&quot;
<br>
can be transformed into productive belief that can be useful
<br>
from an extropic perspective.
<br>
