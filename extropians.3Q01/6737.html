<em>&gt;&gt; This is a very good piece.  I question one thing though.  Why do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we have to move the troops through Pakistan?  Can we airdrop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; enough troops and supplies for what needs to be done?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a word: No.  It is essentially impossible to sustain a ground
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operation by air-drop (i.e. parachute) or even by airlift (i.e.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building or capturing runways) unless your supply base is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nearby or the operation is tiny. &quot;Amateurs study tactics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Professionals study logistics.&quot; Take a look at a map. Notice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how far Afghanistan (and specifically Kabul and the Kandahar)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are from anywhere except Pakistan. Note that cargo aircraft
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot take off and land from aircraft carriers. Remember the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gulf war? The US spent six months building up the supply base.
</em><br>
<p><p>There are a few people on this list that have some practical knowledge of
<br>
these things.  The situation is pretty much this:
<br>
<p>We could support a division or two of light infantry and maybe an Air
<br>
Cavalry unit in Afghanistan.  Note that for rugged mountainous terrain,
<br>
these units are among the best suited, particularly if backed up by some air
<br>
support.  History has shown that heavy mechanized units do not fare well in
<br>
many parts of Afghanistan -- ask the Russians.
<br>
<p>However, there is a wildcard in the Russians.  I'm reading this morning that
<br>
they have mobilized units near the Afghan border.  It is quite possible that
<br>
we could get logistical support and a heavy mechanized hammer for the flat
<br>
areas from the Russians.
<br>
<p>Note that the Russian force structure has difficulty working in extremely
<br>
mountainous terrain; the Afghans learned this years ago and used it against
<br>
them quite effectively.  If the US provided security in the heavily
<br>
mountainous regions, something we are capable of doing effectively, it would
<br>
give the Russians a chance to move heavy equipment where needed.
<br>
<p>If the Russians can control the plains, and leave the mountainous regions to
<br>
the kinds of units that the Americans will be able to support logistically,
<br>
any groups of militant or military Afghans will find themselves severely
<br>
squeezed.  The targets are not numerically numerous, but they did learn how
<br>
to use the terrain to their advantage against the Russians.  The ability of
<br>
the US to control the mountainous terrain, something we are well-structured
<br>
for, will determine whether or not this play is successful.
