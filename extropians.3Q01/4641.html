<em>&gt;  Isn't it odd that OUR ideas are classified as 'eugenics' by the state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the luddites, when it is their policies that are eugenics in fact?
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry, I must have expressed myself badly.  It isn't the classification 
<br>
of our ideas that I was saying was a problem, it was the label.  You can 
<br>
talk about the ideas (almost) as much as you want, without running into the 
<br>
problem I was talking about.  If you use the term &quot;eugenics&quot; to label 
<br>
anything you espouse, you will immediately lose a significant part of your 
<br>
audience.  If you feel the term is more important than the audience, then I 
<br>
won't try to keep you from using it.  I only make the recommendation so 
<br>
people I respect will consider whether they are preemptively offending some 
<br>
audiences before they can start talking about their ideas.
<br>
<p>I was trying to think of an analogous term earlier, and I finally came up 
<br>
with a symbol that will do.  The swastika has a long and respectable 
<br>
history before the Nazis used it.  Unfortunately, it will be a good long 
<br>
time before it is possible to use a swastika as a symbol for anything you 
<br>
want people to respect without drawing unwelcome assocations.  All I'm 
<br>
saying is it would be an improvement in communication to use a different 
<br>
symbol.
<br>
<p>If you (Mike) are trying to tell me that it's a lost cause, because some 
<br>
people will call our ideas eugenics whether we use the term or not, I'll 
<br>
beg to differ.  Not all of the people who left the room in Anders' anecdote 
<br>
would have been offended by the ideas if the term &quot;eugenics&quot; hadn't been 
<br>
introduced at the beginning.  Those are the people you could win over with 
<br>
your ideas if you don't use terms that can be predicted to drive them away. 
<br>
&nbsp;And I don't see what it has to do with having a sense of humor.
<br>
<p>You also underline my point by using &quot;eugenics&quot; to indicate disapproval in 
<br>
the line I quoted above.
