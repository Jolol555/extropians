<p>
Attached below is my letter to Scientific American
<br>
regarding some of the errors in the Whitesides article.
<br>
<p>I've finally put a number on how much blood based
<br>
on the current world population and the U.S. death
<br>
rates.  Gradual declines in the death rate will probably
<br>
be offset by population increases and the fact that some
<br>
people may not choose lifespan extension in the &quot;diamond
<br>
age&quot; is probably balanced by a much higher death rate
<br>
in 3rd world countries at this time.  So its probably
<br>
a pretty good ballpark number.
<br>
<p>Harvey, if you read this, I think it provides a good
<br>
example of how to pick your battles.  I'll probably
<br>
convert this to hypertext, add the links and put
<br>
it in my Critiques section.  Then it will get Googled
<br>
and in the future we just point people at it when
<br>
they attempt to drag the Whitesides article up as
<br>
a proof against MNT.  What we need is an Extropian
<br>
Bingo Code for the arguments.  That way when someone says
<br>
&quot;you can't use nanobots to extend the human lifespan
<br>
because Whitesides says they will be unable to navigate
<br>
in the body&quot;, we say B3, meaning of course that you
<br>
need to go read Nanomedicine Section 9.4 and come
<br>
back when you can engage in a reasonable discussion.
<br>
Of course then we would look quite a bit more cultish
<br>
than we already do...
<br>
<p>Oh, and I did send a copy to Whitesides so it will be
<br>
interesting to see if it gets any response.
<br>
<p>(There has to be some poetic justice in life when the
<br>
Harvard drop-outs get to drag the Harvard professor's
<br>
arguments through the mud. :-))
<br>
<p>Robert
<br>
<p>==========================================================
<br>
Dear Sirs,
<br>
<p>I would like to call your attention to some errors in your
<br>
recent article by George Whitesides regarding nanotechnology.
<br>
<p>First, Dr. Whitesides states,
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;The flagellar motor does not act by using electric current
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to generate moving magnetic fields; instead it uses the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;decomposition of ATP to cause changes in the shape of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;molecules that, when combined with a sophisticated molecular
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ratchet, makes the protein shaft revolve.&quot;
<br>
<p>Unfortunately this is incorrect.  As [1, pgs 447-450, 2] document,
<br>
the flagellum is a hydrogen ion driven motor.  It only uses
<br>
ATP to perform its protein export functions.
<br>
<p>Second, Dr. Whitesides attempts to make the case against
<br>
nanosubmarines as &quot;ships approximately 100 nanometers in scale&quot;,
<br>
perhaps because the National Science Foundation is defining
<br>
&quot;nanotechnology&quot; at that scale.  To the best of my knowledge
<br>
no one who is serious about the feasibility of molecular
<br>
nanotechnology has ever suggested that nanobots would be
<br>
that size.  People who are familiar with the literature know
<br>
that 100 nm is the size of a nanoassembler arm [3, pg 401 &amp;
<br>
4, pg 14] and the existant serious design studies for
<br>
nanobots [5,6,7] describe them as ~1 micron in size, approximately
<br>
the same size as a typical bacteria or mitochondria.
<br>
That would be 1000 times the volume and mass of the
<br>
nanosubmarines that Dr. Whitesides imagines.
<br>
<p>Finally, his arguments regarding the locomotion, detection abilities
<br>
and energy sources for nanobots demonstrate a lack of knowledge
<br>
of the large body of work that has been done on such topics [8].
<br>
<p>While I could write a more extended critique, I think my
<br>
point is clear.  If Scientific American wants a &quot;scientific&quot;
<br>
critique of the applications of molecular nanotechnology
<br>
they should seek out writers who have read the literature.
<br>
The editors should also have articles containing information
<br>
regarding microbiology or medicine reviewed by experts
<br>
in those fields, particularly when they are written by
<br>
someone whose primary expertise is chemistry.  An essay
<br>
providing some other examples of why it is dangerous
<br>
to place too high a value on scientists speaking outside
<br>
their areas of expertise may be found in [9].
<br>
<p>Scientific American should resist attempts to fan the
<br>
animosities between the believers and disbelievers in
<br>
molecular nanotechnology.  Why?  Because if, and I realize
<br>
its a big if, the believers happen to be right, and the
<br>
misconstructed arguments of the disbelievers happen to
<br>
be wrong, the costs in premature deaths due to delays in
<br>
the development of the full vision outlined by Drexler [10]
<br>
are in excess of 53 million human lives -- *each* year.
<br>
That is greater than the combined military and civilian
<br>
losses in all of World War II.  Think about that.
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
Robert Bradbury
