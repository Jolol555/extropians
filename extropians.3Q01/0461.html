<p>I'm not surprised by this though. They would not be considered a cult
<br>
only because they are so numerous. They are called introverts. While I
<br>
understand that some extroverts can't understand the idea of privacy as
<br>
a goal, an equal number of introverts can't understand the exstacy of
<br>
splattering one's life all over the public's view, and generally find
<br>
people who do to be rather obnoxious and repellent creatures, no matter
<br>
what their physical beauty.
