<p><em>&gt;Much too pessimisstic.  At least until recently you could get

</em><br>
<p>Maybe some would. I really loathed the red tape when I was on the dole, on
<br>
and off. Luckily, back then I was one of the first with a home PC (a Kaypro
<br>
II in its tin box) and could pump out a dozen long-winded highly
<br>
circumstantial job applications a week, mailed to anyone remotely relevant
<br>
in the job ads (I never got back an invitation to an interview).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Do you hate what you do for a living enough to be tempted?  Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you think many people really do?  
</em><br>
<p>But mais oui, tout le monde! More or less. Working in Westciv is by and
<br>
large, after all, a shitty, horrible experience. I guess most of the people
<br>
here, programmers on the whole I believe, haven't got a clue how awful and
<br>
soul-destroying most industrial work is. (I've done a bit of it, enough to
<br>
cure me for life.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When only 25% of even major
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lottery winners decide to not seek any gainful work why on earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would you think a whopping 25% would do it for something on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;order of $10000/yr? 
</em><br>
<p>The speculative figure I cited earlier, which Lee seems to have overlooked,
<br>
was $US 25K per family of four. Is that as much as $US 10K per adult?
<br>
Surely a bit less.
<br>
<p>Lee asked if we need to read through the economists I cited. Well, Robin
<br>
Hanson will assure you, from previous list discussion on this topic, that I
<br>
am Not A Doctor of Philosophy in Economics. (In fact I failed Econ I back
<br>
in 1963, which doesn't embarrass me as much as might be the case had it not
<br>
been part of a [botched] attempt to work around some onerous and truly
<br>
stupid academic requirements for an Arts degree). I think at a certain
<br>
point--quite early on, actually--one needs to sit down and read some of the
<br>
elaborate work on the GMI topic, starting from the 1960s. I was galvanized
<br>
by the late Robert Theobald's books, for example.
