ct forwards,
<br>
<em>&gt; Global climate change does occur, however, and sometimes so quickly that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can watch it happening. Just look at our neighbor, Mars: within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last month, the global atmospheric temperature of Mars has increased by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximately 50 degrees Fahrenheit, according to data being received by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on NASA's Mars Global Surveyor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spacecraft.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The cause of this sudden shift is a giant dust storm that has snowballed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and now has enveloped almost the entire planet, absorbing a lot of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sun's energy in the upper atmosphere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;In the end, the cloaking of the entire planet with dust is probably going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to cool down the surface of Mars significantly and ultimately shut this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire weather system down again,&quot; said Christensen. &quot;It's kind of like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we imagine would happen with a nuclear winter on Earth.&quot; In fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christensen points out, it was another global dust storm observed on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mars in the early 1970's that gave astronomer Carl Sagan and others the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea of the kind of catastrophic climate change that might be caused by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a global nuclear war.
</em><br>
<p>It's funny how our observations and interpretations are guided by
<br>
the current political landscape.  In the 1970s there was talk of an
<br>
impending ice age, and the 1980s brought the nuclear winter scare, so the
<br>
emphasis on the Mars dust storms was the resulting *fall* in temperature.
<br>
Today the worry is global warming, so we read about the sudden *rise*
<br>
in temperature on Mars.
<br>
<p>Imagine the headline 20 years ago being Mars Dust Storms Raise Temperature
<br>
50 Degrees.  That would have been no more possible than to see one today
<br>
about a sudden drop in temperature.
<br>
<p>I hope that someday we will have improved our communications technology
<br>
to the point that news can be disseminated with much less concern about
<br>
political implications.  Of course the net is a great step forward.
<br>
20 years ago there would have been no way for us to express our
<br>
concerns about these issues, except perhaps through letters to the
<br>
editor.  Distributed virtual communities allow for sharing of news and
<br>
information outside the control of the great political and economic
<br>
powers.  Talk radio and magazines offer other avenues.  But we still
<br>
don't have an integrated system where these two worlds can coexist:
<br>
the official, respectable, politically correct one, and the anarchic,
<br>
diverse, uncomfortable and unflinching world.
<br>
<p>The various proposals for bringing a more critical eye to factual
<br>
reporting have never come to fruition.  Xanadu, Crit mediator and other
<br>
web-commentary systems, back links, Drexler's fact forums, all have
<br>
remained nothing but toys.  Maybe the world's just not ready for them.
<br>
But Slashdot has been reasonably successful despite the often abysmal
<br>
quality of their moderation system (which attempts to select and highly
<br>
higher-quality commentary).  Perhaps it will eventually grow to add some
<br>
parallel mechanisms to help to integrate parallel viewpoints into a story.
