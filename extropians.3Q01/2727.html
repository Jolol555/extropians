<p><em>&gt; In the post civil war era, there was a significant scandal during
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reconstruction where it was found that former slave holders were using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local law enforcement to put freed slaves back into a state of peonage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and to prevent voter registration, as well as passing local laws which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevented freed slaves from being armed to defend themselves and their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land against lynching and seizure of property. Congress put together a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commission about this matter, which resulted in them proposing what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; became the 14th Amendment, which congress mandated rebel states ratify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before they would be readmitted to the union, and specifically mandated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that freed slaves be allowed to arm themselves, and those who failed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforce it lost reconstruction funding. Most southern states refused to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept reconstruction funding rather than enforce the 14th amendment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; locally, which is why the south languished economically until WWI.
</em><br>
<p>That sounds very strange to me.  From the 1870s to the 1920s,
<br>
the southern states languished economically because they didn't
<br>
receive &quot;reconstruction funding&quot;?  That can't be correct.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
