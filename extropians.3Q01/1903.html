<em>&gt; Minds are as physical a phenomena as ketchup, or a galaxy swirling, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farting, or comming up with new cosmological theories, or fucking. Do I need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to tell you of all people, that mind is the squirting of neurochemicals and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hopping of electrons? Mind is the fountainhead { (:OÞ) } of existence
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; makes experiences worthwhile, other wise your value and the value of a
</em><br>
pebble
<br>
<em>&gt; at the bottom of the Marrianas Trench are the same. In other words Value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Death (maybe thats plonkable?).
</em><br>
<p>Have you read _Mind Is A Myth_, by U. G. Krishnamurti?

<p><em>&gt; The satisfied customer, who, without volition of their own, and tastes of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own, equals an atomaton, and never a very good one. There is a qhole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slwq of customers of this one uploaded person to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfied-personal-business-political-etc. Some are proggies-some are meaty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foggies such as I.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I see what you mean. As for myself, forbearing satisfaction keeps me
<br>
awake and dispels dreams. You've helped to change my opinion of uploading
<br>
(thank you), and it suddenly occurs to me that we can all function as empty
<br>
vessels for containing hyper-awareness, if we just let go of ego illusions.
<br>

<p>Stay hungry,

<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, and ego.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
