In reply to M. E. Smith, someone claiming to be J. R. Malloy writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Religious fanatics are dishonest if they are not mentally ill, because only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychologically disturbed people could believe the childish mythology of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miracles and fantasy that makes up religionism.
</em><br>
<p>I think that your definition of &quot;psychologically disturbed&quot; is too broad.
<br>
Sad to say, lack of critical thinking ability (or desire) isn't that
<br>
uncommon, even among good citizens that would make very good neighbors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the context of a world mad with religious wars [only slightly over-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stated], where religionists are willing to die for the memes that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infected their brains, where the security of the entire planet is threatened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by zealouts who deliberately attempt to fulfill the apocalyptic prophecies of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their sacred scriptures (at the expense of anyone who gets in their way),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where Inquisitions and witchhunts seek to silence every voice of reason, where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infallible popery masquerades as compassion, where innocent children are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taught to hate and kill anyone who does not embrace their parents pious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fanaticism, where parochialism and provincialism spawn divisiveness in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name of diversity, where nearly the whole human race is cognitively crippled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and lives in fear of tyrants who threaten damnation and eternal hell for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disobeying asinine religious edicts, where ceremony and tradition stifle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original ideas and new solutions, it becomes clear why the phrase &quot;to make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion out of it&quot; means to alienate from freedom something that was once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beautiful and to deform it into an ugly form of psychological death.
</em><br>
<p>Strong words, but alas, true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sexual liberation threatens religionists because their particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; type of bigotry denies sex and sexuality, and this denial is yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another indication of their dishonesty and irresponsibility.
</em><br>
<p>Sexual liberation threatens all conservatives (not just the religious)
<br>
because it dangerously counters hard-won traditions established over
<br>
hundreds of years that perhaps enabled the society to become stable
<br>
and prosperous.  To what degree societal traditions (e.g. belief in
<br>
God) can be discarded requires careful thought and good judgment,
<br>
and should be addressed one at a time (see the works of Hayek for
<br>
a thorough discussion).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Thus, &quot;unusual&quot; brain states in which the boundaries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of our &quot;self&quot; are radically altered are not neccessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;less accurate representations&quot; of reality. Perhaps they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are like different but equally valid reference frames
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; involved when doing simple analyses of the kinematics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of playing tennis on a moving train, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps you need to have a good orgasm to dispel these delusions...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... If you ever come to your senses, you'll find that it radically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alters your analyses, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Delusions?  &quot;Come to your senses&quot;?  You and I may disagree with
<br>
the statements, but that hardly makes them delusional.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but &quot;the Self&quot; doesn't qualify for this [my] select
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list, because no one really hypothesizes &quot;the Self.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead, almost everyone grows up inloading this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delusion by cultural osmosis. IOW, it's a product of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary psychology and emotional conditioning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than deliberate hypothesis.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that it's a delusion.  The extent of the
<br>
integrity of behavioral responses and information
<br>
processing make &quot;selves&quot; as real (in many people, at
<br>
least) as many other higher level patterns.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; So, my point is that if we can locate the area of the brain responsible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for religious ecstasy, perhaps we can also locate the area of the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for violent religious zealotry... and remove it like a wart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a tumor.
</em><br>
<p>You have to expect that anyone who disagrees with you will
<br>
interpret this in the worst possible way.  Were we all on
<br>
the same wavelength, then perhaps disclaimers like &quot;of course
<br>
individuals (or their parents) would be the ones authorizing
<br>
such removal&quot; wouldn't be necessary.  But they are here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This tends to &quot;debunk&quot; the premise of &quot;Debunk All
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Religiosity Equally&quot;,  but that should be obvious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (Would you propose to attack all philosophies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equally? How about economic systems; are they all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equally bad?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may be &quot;obvious&quot; or seem that way to you, but I doubt it. I rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think you know better, and that you're just trolling for a flame war.
</em><br>
<p>How can you be so sure?  I'll be really impressed if you turn out
<br>
to be right, but in the mean time, what are the signs that M. E.
<br>
Smith doesn't just have an honest difference of opinion?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are probably not stupid enough to believe that I'd propose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything of the sort you mention.  Your implication that I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do so belies your dishonesty and attempted deception.
</em><br>
<p>Probably the writer was merely over-reacting to some of your
<br>
strongly worded statements (some of which really ought to have
<br>
been qualified, like I said).  Still, the writer is entirely
<br>
unjustified to state that you (or anyone else here) favors
<br>
violent suppression of religion.  At most he could have been
<br>
uncertain, and so should have inquired as to what you meant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thank you for conceding... (the first part of your rant),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but this does not logically lead to the conclusion of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last part of your rant.
</em><br>
<p>What do you mean by rant?  I thought that a rant was a lengthy,
<br>
highly charged emotional attack on someone or something.  Quite
<br>
frankly, what you've written is closer to a rant (well, what
<br>
I think that &quot;rant&quot; means) than what Smith wrote.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That fact that religious experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resides in a part of the human brain in no way excuses the mass murders and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mayhem inflicted upon the human population by religious fanatics and zealots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the Crusades and the Inquistion to mention just two). One might as well try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to excuse the actions of rapists on the grounds that sexual gratification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operates in a particular area of the brain.
</em><br>
<p>If that's what people are doing, then I couldn't agree with you more.
<br>
We have too much of a tendency in this society to excuse behavior
<br>
once we understand it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To conflate meditative experience with religious fanaticism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a cheap trick of the lowest kind.  Shame on you.
</em><br>
<p>Again, how the devil do you know that it was deliberate?  Or
<br>
rather, was a deliberate trick?  Couldn't it have been just
<br>
erroneous views coupled with misunderstanding?  Or am I being
<br>
naive?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You're argument has generally been that all religions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are bad and should be wiped out (through force?), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then you turn around and recommend a book which presents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;mystical experiences&quot; in a positive light, revealing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how they have their basis in actual occurrences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the brain.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Please re-read the subject line. It reads &quot;Debunk All
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Religiosity...&quot; Your over-reaction and defensiveness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shows how weak you must feel.
</em><br>
<p>Many things besides weakness cause over-reaction and
<br>
defensiveness, e.g., (1) fear of ridicule (2) fear of
<br>
being shouted down [yes, ridiculous on an email list,
<br>
but nonetheless a real feeling]  (3) anger at having
<br>
been insulted or made light of  (4) impatience or
<br>
frustration at unexpected opposition or argument  (5)
<br>
inarticulateness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since you are a troll, go back to lurking. Welcome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to my &quot;Blocked Senders&quot; list.
</em><br>
<p>Talk about over-reaction!  Or do you have a lot of
<br>
previous experience with Mr. (or Ms.) Smith?
