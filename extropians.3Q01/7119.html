AI's at risk from viral memes ??From: Smigrodzki, Rafal
<br>
&lt;<a href="mailto:extropians@tick.javien.com?Subject=Re:%20AI's%20at%20risk%20from%20viral%20memes%20??&In-Reply-To=&lt;003a01c14158$f261aea0$6f5d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">extropians@tick.javien.com</a>&gt;
<br>
&lt;&lt;The book &quot;Religion explained&quot; (I forgot it's author's name), recently
<br>
discussed on this list, gives some coherent, detailed and quite compelling
<br>
answers to this question.
<br>
Our evolved neural mechanisms, mainly devoted to the analysis of social
<br>
interactions (intuitive psychology) are prone to recognize certain ideas as
<br>
&quot;salient&quot;, leading to many inferences, and therefore likely to be remembered.
<br>
These ideas evolve over time and gain sophistication, co-opting many parts of
<br>
our brain in their spread. What starts as a vague idea of &quot;ancestors&quot; who know
<br>
of our misdeeds and can be bargained with, develops over a few thousand years
<br>
into a complicated system of rules and fantasies, intricately linked to the
<br>
fabric of the society, and supported by secondary types of interactions
<br>
(coalition building, formation of memetic &quot;brand names&quot;, like Christianity,
<br>
and others).
<br>
Good book. I knew religion was silly since I was 7 years old but now I know
<br>
why it is so persistent.
<br>
The AI, if executed properly, could be just as impervious to Rev. Falwell's
<br>
blandishments as the staunchest infidels on our list, if not more.
<br>
Rafal Smigrodzki &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Your summary of the situation is both incisive and accurate. As a staunch
<br>
infidel on this list, I look forward to the day when pure intelligence wipes
<br>
out all religious fanaticism once and for all.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
