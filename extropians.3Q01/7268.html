<p>Tall buildings are designed with rather significant fire fighting
<br>
systems: sprinklers, extinguishers, halon systems, etc along with fire
<br>
resistant doors and walls, etc. The impact of the airliners obviously
<br>
destroyed much of these systems and features, and the 10,000 kg of
<br>
burning jet fuel was far more than the system was designed to handle,
<br>
especially for what part of the sprinkler system that was left.
<br>
<p>In the event of a normal fire, people are trained to move up or down x
<br>
many floors to give the fire suppression systems time to work. No normal
<br>
fire is bad enough to require that entire skyscrapers be evacuated, not
<br>
since the MGM Grande fire in Las Vegas many years ago.
<br>
<p>In the event of an overload, like dumping lots of jet fuel on the fire,
<br>
there is no way to deal with such a situation unless you build in far
<br>
greater capacity to the system.
