<p>Yes, the focus should be to identify the costs of the externalities
<br>
and make them be paid for up front.  A more advanced analysis would
<br>
include estimates of technological progress and determine whether
<br>
paying for them later would actually be less expensive.  The actual
<br>
cost of paying for them now or later has to be balanced with
<br>
the impact on humanity (and the potential loss of life).

<p><em>&gt; If you read Julian Simon's &quot;The Ultimate Resource 2&quot;, you'll see lots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments that many of these changes would likely have come about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without infringing on anyone's freedom.  One of Simon's arguments is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that as societies get richer, industry develops technologies that use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever more of the inputs effectively, and that side effects are mitigated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because companies find it more cost effective to reuse and recycle.i
</em><br>
<p>The development of these technologies is predictable so long as competition
<br>
exists.  However, there may be investment &amp; profit barriers to implementing
<br>
the technologies (wind &amp; solar power come to mind).  Since the cost of
<br>
technologies may scale inversely with demand, then the imposition of
<br>
freedom violating regulations or laws may be necessary to get over
<br>
the barrier to the production of low-cost technologies that can be
<br>
used by everyone.  [The needs of the many outweigh the needs of
<br>
the few, or the one???]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another driver is that the public wants a cleaner environment for lots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of reasons, and finds ways to encourage their neighbors to not mess up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the neighborhood.
</em><br>
<p>This is the &quot;art of the long view&quot; -- it only comes when people collectively
<br>
begin to realize that *they* may have to pay for the mess they are creating.
<br>
So long as you &quot;know&quot; you are going to be dead in 100 years, it is in one's
<br>
[did I get that apostrophe right???] self-interest to borrow from the
<br>
commons and let the next generation clean up the mess.  However, once
<br>
one begins to realize that one may reap what one has sown, then clarity
<br>
begins to emerge.
<br>
<p>It would be interesting to run this simulation all over again, only instead
<br>
of managing it with &quot;freedom&quot; violating impositions of law to manage
<br>
it with government funded &quot;advertising&quot; to the public about the shame
<br>
they should feel for burdening their children with the consequences
<br>
of their choices.
