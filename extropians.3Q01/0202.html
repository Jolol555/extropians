I had written:
<br>
<em>&gt; The movie is certainly not meant as a case study, a cautionary tale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about how not to design your robot.  It is probably not even meant to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get people to be nicer to their robots in the future.
</em><br>
<p>But I see in an article at
<br>
<a href="http://filmforce.ign.com/ai/articles/200190p1.html">http://filmforce.ign.com/ai/articles/200190p1.html</a>:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here it would be observant to restate a point made by Sara Maitland,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another writer with whom Kubrick collaborated on A.I. In her article
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My Year with Stanley,&quot; published in The Independent in March 1999
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(referenced by Argent), she states Kubrick &quot;believed computers will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;become truly intelligent, including emotionally and are potentially
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more environmentally adaptable form of human beings: they are our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;future. The film is intended to make us love them.&quot;
<br>
<p>So here we have Kubrick himself apparently saying that his intention in
<br>
making AI was to get people to love their robots, exactly contradicting
<br>
what I wrote above.  Who knew?
<br>
<p>BTW the article also has an interesting story about the genesis of
<br>
Gigolo Joe.  Kubrick had observed that David in his journey needed a
<br>
guide, someone older and wiser, &quot;a G.I. Joe character&quot;.  Ian Watson went
<br>
off and worked on this and G.I. Joe became Gigolo Joe.
