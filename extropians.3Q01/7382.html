<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the content valuable, or rendered valueless?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The latter. To cite a recent case, a superficially reasonable email on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; post-WTC policy sailed into my inbox a few days ago. It made sense right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unto the final sentence, which read &quot;God bless America&quot;. Now, I don't

pushing
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it. Sooner or later, the dissonance must surface.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is the big deal here?  Saying &quot;God bless America&quot; speaks quite
</em><br>
directly
<br>
<em>&gt; to the 90% of Americans according to polls who have some level of theistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief.  To ask for God's blessing on America in the face of 9/11 and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of belief is almost mandatory if you want to reach the people and
</em><br>
speak
<br>
<em>&gt; to their hearts.  Why should those who are not theistic make such a big
</em><br>
deal
<br>
<em>&gt; about this?
</em><br>
<p>Well, then, what about the remaining 10% - are we chopped liver?  When a
<br>
President speaks to all the &quot;American people,&quot; how does it compromise
<br>
anything he may need to say if he simply talks about the business at hand?
<br>
(In fact, he compromises what he has to say every time he mentions God,
<br>
because that's coo-coo and childish, e.g., just like having an &quot;Invisible
<br>
Friend,&quot; you know, except for grownups.)  Certainly it's the President's
<br>
right to mention God, just as it is his right to mention that he believes
<br>
the earth is flat (althouth even if he and 90% of Americans believed THAT,
<br>
it would still not make it true).  But, and this is the most important
<br>
issue, he would still be excluding 90% of his audience.  Neutrality
<br>
regarding the God issue is a better idea, IMHO - we are supposed to be a
<br>
secular government, after all.  However, it may be more appropriate for the
<br>
President to talk about &quot;God&quot; to a captive audience of churchgoers, for
<br>
instance (although it would still be coo-coo).
<br>
<p>Here is something interesting I picked up from one of those free weekly
<br>
left-and-right of center alternative presses (a point of view the regular
<br>
dailies in America are not wont to print, as it makes just too much sense
<br>
and may radicalize the delicate sensibilities of their reading audience):
<br>
<p>Dan Savage in The Stranger, Sept. 20, 2001 (excerpt from his column &quot;Savage
<br>
Love&quot;):
<br>
<p>&quot;Who could be against prayer at a time like this?  Or against God?  Well, I
<br>
am.  Does anyone doubt for a moment that the people on those four doomed
<br>
planes were praying?  I imagine that the doomed people hanging out of the
<br>
windows of the World Trade Center were praying too, as were the people all
<br>
over the country watching this tragedy unfold on TV. I even slipped up and
<br>
said a prayer.  And what good did that prayer do?
<br>
<p>&quot; 'If we believe absurdities,' Voltaire said, 'we will commit atrocities.'
<br>
On September 11, suicidal Islamic radicals, their heads stuffed with
<br>
absurdities, committed the most appalling atrocities.   And what are we told
<br>
to do in response?  Trot out our own absurdities: Turn to God.  Pray to God.
<br>
God listens.  God cares.  Does He really?  If so, I'd really like to see Him
<br>
get off his ass and prove it once in a while.&quot;
