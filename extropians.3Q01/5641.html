<br>
No Mike, I'm not forgetting.  In case you don't know we actually
<br>
have a U.S. Senator from WA that used her own .com money to get
<br>
elected and ran a very close race while pointing that out.
<br>
I suppose you think it should be that way and then we certainly
<br>
would have a government &quot;of the people&quot; (sarcasm intended).
<br>
[I know its not really &quot;of the people&quot; now, but I wouldn't want to
<br>
see what the country would look like if we required that &quot;average&quot;
<br>
people run it (though I think we will get to see over the
<br>
next 3 years)].
<br>
<p>Now I think the point should be that whatever the Clintons are
<br>
making they aren't collecting it from you or I (to the best of
<br>
my knowledge) and will not until they run for something again
<br>
and potentially use matching campaign funds.  Why don't you
<br>
criticize Madonna from extorting all that money from her fans that
<br>
buy her records or go to here concerts?  If the Clintons hold
<br>
a dinner and people want to go to here them speak or even shake
<br>
their hands *What the blazes is the matter with that?*  They
<br>
have skills, they have insights, they have connections, if
<br>
people want to pay to have access to those I don't see anything
<br>
wrong with that.
<br>
<p>My suspicion would be that any extra campaign funds will end up
<br>
going into a Hilary bid on the White house in '04 or '08.
<br>
So the money you are talking about isn't really going to
<br>
&quot;The Clintons&quot;, its going to see if they can put a woman
<br>
in the White House.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why would someone spend tens of millions of dollars to get elected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; president, a position that only pays a measely $400k/year, if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were not planning on stealing/soliciting bribes to get it all back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before they leave office?
</em><br>
<p>Ego and ambition perhaps?  Patriotism?  A belief that one of them
<br>
might do a better job than the other yoyos up for the position?
<br>
I have a hard time believing Mike that you think every politician
<br>
is a crook.  Or is it just the Clintons?
<br>
<p>Oh yes, and just for the record, I'm not a big fan of the
<br>
Clintons.  I voted for Perot.

<p>Huh?  What was the whole impeachment trial all about?
<br>
If that isn't an attempt to hold someone accountable, then I
<br>
don't know what is.
<br>
<p>It should never have gone to trial in the first place.
<br>
Sex should remain a topic for the participants and not
<br>
public consumption.  If you thought Clinton should have
<br>
been impeached, then there is a long line of previous
<br>
presidents you think should have been impeached as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and endangering the public with acts of war (to deflect attention from

</em><br>
<p>I presume that we are talking about Kosovo here (or are we looking
<br>
back to Bosnia?).  I tend to ignore politics because I've got better
<br>
things to do.  But in both situations I think we made the right
<br>
decision.  It is unextropic to let people die if you have a reasonable
<br>
chance at stopping it at a affordable cost.  I'll point out
<br>
(a) we have a volunteer army folks -- the people in it know
<br>
what they are there for; (b) In both cases we seem to have
<br>
been fairly successful at stopping the bloodshed; (c) For the
<br>
first time in history we get to put some of the idiots who
<br>
started the mess on trial -- which may make future idiots think
<br>
twice before starting such insanity; (d) we may have averted the
<br>
development of an even larger conflict that would have required an
<br>
even more significant intervention at a higher cost of life.
<br>
(Or are we forgetting the lessons of WWI and WWII already?)
<br>
<p>Now *IF* there is a blood on the hands of the President its for
<br>
*NOT* intervening in Africa when we could have.  It it isn't
<br>
on his hands alone because the Europeans could have done something
<br>
as well and did not.
