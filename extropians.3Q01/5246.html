Yes you can change the way gravity acts on your body depending on which
<br>
theoretical construct. People do it all the time. People at one time did
<br>
not think it was possible to fly. Once shown they could some thought it
<br>
was against nature or evil. An airplane defies gravity. There is no
<br>
other explanation for it.
<br>
<p>Granted, while sitting in the seat one still experiences gravity, so
<br>
your argument may be gravity has not been really overcome, but that was
<br>
not the context of your original statement. You asked if a person could
<br>
change the way gravity acts on the body by changing views. Yes, because
<br>
if people did not think it was possible to fly, or defy gravity, it
<br>
would never have been attempted.
<br>
<p>Why do you say the nonrealist position is subjective? That doesn't make
<br>
much sense. Realism is built solely on the premise of a priori or steady
<br>
state truth statements. That means when one enters into analytical
<br>
reasoning, a criterium is already established with respect to the
<br>
result, that it be &quot;real&quot;. Seems to me realism is much more subjective
<br>
and you have it backwards.

<em>&gt;Whether our understanding of a phenomenon is flawed or not does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invalidate its existence or cancel out its effects upon us. Can you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change how gravity acts against your body depending on which theoretical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;construct you happen to believe in? No you can't, can you? Then get over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your silly subjectivist ideas.
