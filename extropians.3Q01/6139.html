<p>I was working in a small company last year that was wanting to do some 
<br>
really cool stuff. I, and the others doing the grunt programming and 
<br>
designing worked hard on low pay, while unknown to us the two who ran the 
<br>
company went thru vast amounts of money quite irresponsibly, accruing all 
<br>
the trappings of immense personal wealth. They drove the company into the 
<br>
ground. I left just before the end when I started to see what was happening 
<br>
(I was owed a month and a half of pay by that time. A friend of mine stayed 
<br>
longer due to the sweet words and persuasiveness of the owners. He is out 
<br>
by something like 5 months pay. The two owners are still well off and can't 
<br>
be touched. None of us workers have any likelihood of ever getting our pay.
<br>
<p>I know that the owners didn't intend to milk the company to death, but that 
<br>
is what they ended up doing. They were like kids in a candy store and 
<br>
wanted it all... and they thought that they deserved it.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
