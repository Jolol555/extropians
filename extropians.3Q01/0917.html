<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So; why no SourceForge (www.sourceforge.net) project?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We might try and open-source the development of tools, if they're tools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can be useful to others.  In fact, that's currently the plan with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect to at least one of the tools we might need.  But the AI itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't seem like the kind of thing that could be open-sourced.  I used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plan that way, but later learned, on reading my Eric S. Raymond, that open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source is especially well suited to certain types of projects, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally intelligent AI is not one of them.  Characteristics that make AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong for open-source include:  (1) Open-source works best when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creation to be implemented is well-understood (Linux was not the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unix implementation);
</em><br>
<p>Depends on how you want to define &quot;well understood&quot;. I'd substitute &quot;highest
<br>
level design spec mostly completed&quot; as a minimum. That gives you the all
<br>
important end goal and a navigable pathway towards modularizing development.
<br>
Then the project is just partitioned and subpartitioned, etc, until you end
<br>
up with things that can be coded.
<br>
<p>But I don't think that this is an open source thing -- any software project
<br>
is pretty much doomed unless you know where you're going and have a map for
<br>
dividing up the work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (2) Open-source is very hard to get started unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is running code that does something cool, and there may be a heckuva
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of coding required before a true general intelligence can say &quot;Hello
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world&quot; much less do cool stuff;
</em><br>
<p>Tools will do in this case; a partially finished tool is enough to attract
<br>
developers. Especially if it has cachet by being associated with something
<br>
cool.
<br>
<p>Demonstration models will do as well. You don't need a hello world -- you
<br>
just need a conceptual framework in code form and guidelines on how the
<br>
components will flesh out later. Frameworks in code form attract developers
<br>
like wax things attract bees (bad analogy). They just beg to have components
<br>
coded for them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (3) Open-source works best when code can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be developed by a loosely distributed team working in rough but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfect synchronization; an AI, *especially* in the initial phases, would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably need to be developed by a very tightly knit team.
</em><br>
<p>Initial blocking out of design by tightly knit team, I'd agree, but I've yet
<br>
to meet a project in which less than 80% of the programming time wasn't
<br>
spent on simply completing and fleshing out things that have already been
<br>
spec'ed and prototyped. How would an AI -- and early prototype code -- be
<br>
any different?
<br>
<p>So, ok, after some rambling, my suggestion and 2c worth: I don't think it
<br>
would hurt you guys at all to codify your initial arguments on the form and
<br>
nature of AI into a framework for components -- defining APIs, putting the
<br>
framework together, that's all the tightly knit team stuff. Then open source
<br>
it, announce far and wide, and see who drops out of the woodwork to start
<br>
building components to fit into the framework.
<br>
<p>Now I'm speaking from a position of comparative ignorance, just having read
<br>
your literature and having seen no real model implementations or discussions
<br>
in AI/human simulation language that I'm familiar with from the gaming side
<br>
of things, but I don't see any reason for an AI not to be componentizable...
