<p><em>&gt; I wasnt familiar with the term so I did some searching. Heres what I got:

<em>&gt; Essentialism, in philosophy, is the doctrine that things have essential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properties, properties without which they would not be the things that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are. Many philosophers hold that the essence of water is its real essence;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the essence of water is H2O. So the stuff in my glass has an essential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property, a property without which it would not be the stuff that it is; if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the stuff in my glass did not have the property of being H2O, then it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be water.
</em><br>
<p>That example doesn't seem to work!  I can just imagine you going
<br>
off to planet Y in a very distant galaxy, crashlanding, swimming
<br>
across a large river, drinking the water, using it to water your
<br>
plants, and then having the first officer come yelling to you,
<br>
&quot;Chief!  This stuff isn't H20!&quot;.  You'd then probably conclude
<br>
that not all water in the universe has the same chemical 
<br>
composition.
<br>
<p>Only in mathematics can I think of examples of things that have
<br>
essential properties, e.g., even numbers are divisible by two,
<br>
and even then our terms may be misleading.
<br>
<p>So what is needed are some better examples by those who believe
<br>
in the existence of essential properties.  At least that might
<br>
help me follow what is going on.
