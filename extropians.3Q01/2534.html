<em>&gt; When you turn down a young woman whose dream was to go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to medical school because she's a white, so that you can admit a black with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fewer qualifications, you're making that one young white person pay a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatly disproportionate price. For all we know, maybe the white woman was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the daughter of poor parents; maybe she worked nights to pay her way through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; college. 
</em><br>
<p><p>Being poor and white is probably the worst socioeconomic position in the US
<br>
university system today.  In the eyes of the university system, there is no
<br>
such thing as a poor white person, which generally makes life very difficult
<br>
economically if you are poor and white and going to college.  This naturally
<br>
creates some bitterness when they see the government bending over backwards
<br>
to help minorities pay for school, many who are better off financially than
<br>
the poor white student who receives little or no financial help.  I don't
<br>
see how race preferences in universities reduce racism, but I certainly see
<br>
how it can create negative feelings towards minorities where there were none
<br>
before.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In some cases, rich whites were the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimate beneficiaries, such as when whites set up businesses with black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;owners&quot; so the businesses would be have special status for getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government contracts and so forth. I know this from personal observation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if I observed this sort of thing happening as often as I did, I'm sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it must have been extremely common.
</em><br>
<p><p>I know of several such cases of minority ownership stacking to gain the
<br>
favored &quot;minority owned&quot; status for government contracts.  It is, as you
<br>
guessed, very common.  The government can't change the rules of the game and
<br>
just assume that everyone else won't change the way they play the game to
<br>
compensate.
