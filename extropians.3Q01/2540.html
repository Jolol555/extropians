Mike Lorrey writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Namely, if your group already maintains a very high level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; liberty, and you don't want to lose it, then resistence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; [liberty-destroying] invaders damn near justifies any means.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not necessarily. In a properly libertarian society, any individual with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cash can buy or make a nuclear weapon, or any other weapon. Taxation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my mind, is only NOT theft when the individual is free to choose what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government services they wish to pay for and which not to pay for.
</em><br>
<p>In most historical circumstances in which a free society was
<br>
challenged, nuclear weapons were not available.  Those societies
<br>
were not made up exclusively of white middle class intellectual
<br>
libertarians, and as a practical measure, those societies could
<br>
very well have perished were it not for the ability of their
<br>
government to draft men into armies, redirect industry, and
<br>
tax individuals at the optimum rate to win the war.
<br>
<p>I claim that from 1870 to 1940, the United States was such a
<br>
society, and had a sufficient but realistic threat from Japan,
<br>
and Germany, and possibly the Soviet Union materialized, all
<br>
would have been lost without the laudable capabilities that
<br>
the U.S. did possess to coerce industry to make armaments,
<br>
draft soldiers into enormous armies, and tax people at whatever
<br>
the necessary rate would have been.  I am even considering 
<br>
unlikely cases, such as some alliance of Germany, France, England
<br>
and Japan in 1905 deciding to conquer North America.  Those nations
<br>
working together could only have been defeated by the U.S. in the
<br>
way I've described.  Consideration of examples like this is 
<br>
warranted by our wishing to establish general principles here.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S. I also agreed with Daniel Ust's post.
