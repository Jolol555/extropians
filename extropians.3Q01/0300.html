<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I think there's a big difference between the two -- between &quot;government

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; mandatory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, but the difference is irrelevant to this particular debate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think so.  John M. Cobin's point is that government mandated codes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a different effect than privately evolved ones.  In particular, he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brings up two theories of why this might be is so:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  &quot;Regulation is a public choice phenomenon that primarily serves special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>In my direct personal experience, the only special interests in the
<br>
building code process that gain do so by resisting new codes, and those
<br>
are the owners and developers groups.
<br>
<p>Product manufacturers do benefit when new codes mandate their products,
<br>
this is true, however building code professionals generally disregard
<br>
the studies done by businesses which present their products in the best
<br>
light, waiting for independent scientists to issue rulings. In fact,
<br>
they will rely on the indedpendent science EVEN when that science can be
<br>
shown to be faulty, rather than to rely upon business generated science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2.  &quot;Regulation is unlikely to increase safety efficiently, and perhaps not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively, because it is always constrained by inadequate local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (See <a href="http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume3/v3i1a2s2.html">http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume3/v3i1a2s2.html</a>, the section &quot;Theories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about safety regulation.&quot;)
</em><br>
<p>I would strenuously disagree with this. Local building and fire
<br>
officials are the ones directly involved in the code promulgation
<br>
process at the model, state, and local levels. Architects and engineers
<br>
are required by their state licensing boards to take continuing
<br>
education classes that deal with new building code changes and additions
<br>
to maintain their licenses.
<br>
While some local officials choose to interpret regs in their own
<br>
fashion, such rulings can be easily appealed to higher levels for more
<br>
accurate interpretations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; But Cobin does go over just this point in the third section of the essay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; (<a href="http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume3/v3i1a2s3.html">http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume3/v3i1a2s3.html</a>) when discussing Santiago's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; building code:  &quot;The legislation was designed to establish compulsory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; construction norms for minimum and maximum building height and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; of building materials, plus a means to retard the propagation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fires...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; This code was put into place in 1929, &quot;after a disastrous earthquake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; struck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Talca [another Chilean city] in 1928...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, but the fact that he bases his initial premise so faultily condemns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the whole exercise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wrong!  You are making two assumptions here.  One is that you can dismiss a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole essay based on the abstract.  This leads me to ask, did you even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bother to read it?
</em><br>
<p>I read part of it and gave up because it was framed on so faulty a
<br>
basis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The other is that Cobin's abstract actually contradicts your belief about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;fire safety regs&quot; being made to &quot;The purpose is to reduce the overall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damage and death toll of each individual fire.&quot;  I don't see how this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradicts his abstract.  In fact, that he focuses on structural fires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throughout the essay, kind of tells me that he kind of has this in mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you just looking for a way to disagree here?
</em><br>
<p>No. The problem is that Cobin considers the standard fire of today to be
<br>
the standard fire of yesterday. 100+ years ago, if fires were not
<br>
immediately tended to with citizen bucket brigades, they quickly
<br>
expanded to entire city blocks, completely unmanagable by fire companies
<br>
when they finally arrived on the scene. Even as far back as the Roman
<br>
era, Crassus, for example, became the largest landholder in Rome
<br>
specifically because the fire companies he maintained to support his
<br>
construction teams outsourced on a freelance basis: when fires started
<br>
elsewhere, he would send his brigades to the scene, kick everyone else
<br>
out of the area at sword point, then extort huge fees from the owner as
<br>
the fire burned before starting to fight the fire. Those who refused
<br>
lost their burned out land when they had to sell their property to pay
<br>
irate neighbors who also suffered fire damage due to their dawdling with
<br>
Crassus' men over the terms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I would hazard to guess -- but confess ignorance here:) -- that, in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; past, most fires, too were small and contained.  It wasn't like London
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; burned done once a decade.  You make it sound as if it did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps not the whole city, but large chunks of it did, in fact. Tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me: how many wooden structures remain in London proper that are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than 250 years old? Very few. How about Chicago? Very few.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But what would this prove?  Even if massive fires did not take out wooden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structures, eventually, just piecemeal burning of them over a long enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; period might take them out.  Also, wood structures don't last long even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without fires anyhow.  How many many hundreds years old wooden structures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are there worldwide?  Outside of Scandanavia, I bet very few.  Finally, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would need to separate out technological, economic, and regulatory changes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Large office buildings today, tend to be glass and steel.  (Yet they burn.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes they do, however the rule in development is that a burned out
<br>
demolished lot is far easier and cheaper to work with than having to
<br>
take a building down by hand to build a new one. Additionally, there are
<br>
fires just as frequently, even more frequently due to the expansion of
<br>
use of electricity in buildings, as well as the devolution to low trust
<br>
societies resulting from moral relativism increasing the incidence of
<br>
insurance fraud and financial arson. The worst fires today occur in
<br>
buildings storing highly flammable materials and with the worst records
<br>
of obeying fire codes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A proper study would chart out the percent of individual cities killed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; injured, and left homeless from fire every year before and after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; institution of fire codes in those cities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Granted.  We would also have to try to estimate the number of people made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homeless and the lower amount of social wealth that is caused by either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costly regulation or uneven regulation.  (This brings to mind something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened to a merchant I knew several years ago.  When he became critical of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mayor in his town, his store was visited by the fire inspector --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone he'd never even met before that -- and visited often.)
</em><br>
<p>Sure. One should always expect to see the IRS when one has thumbed his
<br>
nose at the Feds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; What we would need to do is find out if government fire codes have had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; impact you believe they have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Groups like the ICBO, BOCA, etc. have done numerous studies in the past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on this subject illustrating just my point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd have to study the studies before passing judgment here.
</em><br>
<p>Please do.
