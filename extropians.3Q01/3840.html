<em>&gt; I don't. Saying blacks have a cultural predisposition to like jazz music
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't any more racist than saying that Japanese people have a cultural
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; exclude the possibility that people not of those cultures could also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like jazz or sushi.
</em><br>
<p>I think that this is technically racist.  It is may not be negative, it may
<br>
not be positive.  It may be not true, it may not be false.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I doubt anyone here would say my statements about jazz or sushi lovers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are racist. It is only when such cultural generalizations are made which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illustrate members of that culture in a negative light do people try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply the 'racist' label to them. If it doesn't work for positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements but does for negative statements, it's not racism.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  This is where some people get screwed up saying that unfair
<br>
discrimination is racist while affirmative action to undo unfairness is not
<br>
racist.  Both policies are racist whether they are intended to help or harm.
<br>
Both policies are racist whether they turn out to be truthful or fictitious.
<br>
Decision-making based on race is racism no matter what.
<br>
<p>This is where I strongly argue for objective definitions.  The defense
<br>
against racism should not be &quot;but it's true!&quot;.  Or else any racist activity
<br>
could be defended as not racist.  Hitler would claim he was not racist
<br>
because Jews really are subhuman.  Is this a defense?  I don't think so.  He
<br>
was still evaluating a whole group based on their race not on their
<br>
individual merits.  This is the definition of racism.  Negativity or
<br>
Falsehood do no have anything to do with it.  Otherwise, there would be no
<br>
discussion.  Nobody would choose the side of negativity and falsehood.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But what about actions that indirectly causes people of one race to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treated predominantly different than other races, for instance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; geographic based discrimination (like 'risky zip code' restrictions on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mail order deliveries to zip codes with high fraud rates)?
</em><br>
<p>This is not based on the race of the person ordering the item.  Therefore it
<br>
is not racism.  It may effect more blacks than whites because of the racial
<br>
makeup of a particular zip code.  But whites and blacks in that zip code are
<br>
treated the same.  In fact, no one knows the race of the recipient of any
<br>
piece of mail.  No decisions or even knowledge of race enter into this.
