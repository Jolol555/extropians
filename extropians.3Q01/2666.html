<p><p><em>&gt; The working definition I use: _A_ singularity is when everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be happening at once; the rate of change becomes so great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as to be incalculable.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me there are two drastically different important meanings
<br>
to &quot;singularity&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first, will happen &quot;just over the the horizon&quot; of the
<br>
immediate future.  While the second might never happen, and if it
<br>
does, it will effectively be the end of real time.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second one, if it ever occurs at all, will likely be
<br>
something like Tippler's omega point during which everything and
<br>
everyone becomes truly omnipotent, omniscient, all good, all qualia
<br>
experiencing...  In order for this second one to occur our progress
<br>
must be &quot;asymptotic&quot; or such that the slope of our progress becomes
<br>
infinite before some fixed real point in time.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our progress is anything less than this, even if it is
<br>
fantastically &quot;exponential&quot; where even the 3rd, 4th... (or any finite)
<br>
order derivatives (or the slope of the slope of the slope...) are
<br>
forever increasing we will never really reach the truly infinite.  We
<br>
will eventually surpass any finite measure of power, knowledge,
<br>
goodness..., and rate at which we achieve such, but we will never
<br>
become truly infinite.  Remember, there is a HUGE (read infinite)
<br>
difference between any paltry finite being, no matter how fast they
<br>
are progressing, and the infinite.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider just one of the fantastic finite tasks (any finite
<br>
task is infinitely trivial compared to the actual infinite) which must
<br>
be surpassed and become easy for us all, long before we can become
<br>
truly infinite or achieve such a true singularity.  We must all be
<br>
able to simulate and calculate all possible histories of the earth and
<br>
discover which of the near infinitely many is the one true history.
<br>
In other words, we must have the ability to perfectly remember and be
<br>
simultaneously aware of the location of all atoms that have ever been
<br>
within the biosphere of the earth for it's entire history....  Of
<br>
course such would necessarily give us the ability to resurrect every
<br>
animal, including those that are not cryonically preserved, cremated
<br>
or in any way ever &quot;information theoretically&quot; dead.  All such finite
<br>
tasks are infinitely far away from being truly infinite.  And there
<br>
are infinitely many of such finite tasks that are even beyond this
<br>
distant horizon beyond which we cannot yet comprehend.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, 1000 years from now, according to our currently
<br>
very limited and finite reckoning, growth, progress, and everything
<br>
will be happening &quot;at once&quot; or &quot;so great as to be incalculable.&quot;  But
<br>
this is only relative to our current abilities to &quot;calculate&quot;.  I
<br>
think anyone would be absurd to think we could get anywhere near the
<br>
above fantastic and still hard to make out distant horizon within the
<br>
next 1000 years.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our ability to make or comprehend or perceive such
<br>
calculations is a limiting factor which will always prevent us from
<br>
making an instantaneous jump to beyond that horizon.  We must all have
<br>
the ability to calculate how to get there, which must include the
<br>
ability to at least partially perceive what it will be like, before we
<br>
can actually achieve such levels of growth.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for our growth to be asymptotic, or for the second or
<br>
real singularity to occur, something like the &quot;omega&quot; point, in which
<br>
everything, including experiential time, becomes infinitely dense,
<br>
must be achieved.  And even in this scenario, growth according to
<br>
&quot;experiential time&quot; which is constantly accelerating according to real
<br>
time is still merely forever &quot;exponential&quot; according to what we
<br>
experience.  The fact that we can experience 1000 years in a few
<br>
nanoseconds is what will give us the power to push that horizon which
<br>
we can still perceive out even further, giving us the intellect
<br>
required to progress at such ever increasing rates.  If we can
<br>
compress our experiential time experienced during any finite real
<br>
period of time to be infinite, this will enable us to push the horizon
<br>
out beyond the &quot;asymptote&quot; and enable us to make the jump to the
<br>
infinite before some real time limit.  But remember - there is a huge
<br>
difference between experiencing any arbitrarily large finite period of
<br>
experiential time within any arbitrarily period of real time and
<br>
experiencing an infinite amount of experiential time within that same
<br>
amount of real time.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, even in Tipplerian scenarios, where we do get
<br>
there before some finite real time, according to what we experience,
<br>
we will never really get there and we will never really be able to see
<br>
beyond that ever moving horizon beyond which we can't yet ever
<br>
perceive or calculate.  Things in our future will always be just more
<br>
of the same increasingly exciting stuff and will always remain within
<br>
what we can perceive and comprehend.  To think that some single &quot;AI&quot;
<br>
will make it far beyond that horizon before it becomes friendly enough
<br>
and easy enough for it to pull the rest of us up to near it's level to
<br>
help it along seems absurd to me.  Things will forever get more and
<br>
more fun, but will never really get out of our control since more and
<br>
more people will be required to help push us all along that much
<br>
faster.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So while I do like to use the term &quot;singularity&quot; to refer to
<br>
that period of time just beyond our horizon, which will likely remain
<br>
1000 years or so of experiential time beyond where we are now.  (or
<br>
perhaps your settling on a horizon that is much more clean and only as
<br>
far away as October 11th, 2007?)  Such a time being when everything
<br>
will be &quot;so great as to be incalculable&quot; given our current abilities
<br>
no matter how fantastically finite they become.  I dislike the term
<br>
because it is quite misleading.  The term inevitably causes people to
<br>
falsely fear it, as if even when we are in it, we will be lost in and
<br>
unable to perceive its infiniteness.  But this is a completely false
<br>
idea since we cannot progress any faster than we can perceive and
<br>
comprehend.  It's a simple logical fact that we must all be able to
<br>
comprehend some place in time and be able to progress to that point
<br>
before we can have the ability to venture beyond it or any single one
<br>
of us to get way beyond it without all of our help.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One exception to all this might be achieving something like
<br>
the ability to either go back in time, or make computers that can
<br>
calculate faster than infinitely fast.  For if we achieved such, the
<br>
answers to all questions could be answered before we could even ask
<br>
them, not to mention all the other logical paradoxes of such.  But
<br>
again, it'd be my bet that such will not be achieved within the next
<br>
6, 7 or even 1000 years if ever.  So I'm not to worried.  The
<br>
&quot;horizon&quot; is truly far away and not really a point.  It simply becomes
<br>
more and more vague and imperceptible the further out we look.  and it
<br>
is my bet that it will likely forever remain that way as things
<br>
forever get funner, faster and more exciting and more fantastic.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you think about it this is just a twist on the debate
<br>
theists have been having for thousands of years.  Is God truly
<br>
omnipotent... or isn't he?  We don't know.... Yet.
