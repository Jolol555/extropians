</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I have a question for the list.  
<br>
<p>When in the past I've encountered the subject of
<br>
viral/bacterial disease, I've wondered what the
<br>
problem might be that would prevent &quot;immune system
<br>
sharing&quot;.  Person &quot;V&quot; is vaccinated, and person &quot;U&quot; is
<br>
unvaccinated.  When person V is exposed to the
<br>
infectious agent he/she generates antibodies,
<br>
presumably so rapidly that the level of &quot;infection&quot; is
<br>
minimal.  No disease.
<br>
<p>What then would happen if, when person U were to be
<br>
exposed, transfusions between U and V, back and forth,
<br>
were to be commenced? 
<br>
<p>The continued exposure of V to quantities of pathogen
<br>
would, hypothetically and/or logically--I'm guessing
<br>
here--stimulate V's immune system to generate even
<br>
greater quantities of antibodies.  This seems like a
<br>
favorable circumstance.   
<br>
<p>The antibodies generated in V would most certainly
<br>
bind to the pathogens in U.  But would U's killer
<br>
lymphocytes respond to the infectious agents thus
<br>
flagged, and attack them, or will they respond only to
<br>
self-made antibody &quot;flags&quot;?  Would U's immune system
<br>
view V's antibodies as a separate infectious agent and
<br>
begin to generate an immune response to them?  Even if
<br>
it did so, wouldn't it be playing catch-up, as with
<br>
the &quot;real&quot; infection, so that a substantial excess of
<br>
antibodies would still be available to bind to the
<br>
population of pathogen?
<br>
<p>I have to believe that this approach has been thought
<br>
of long since, and that if workable would be in
<br>
widespread use?  So what's the problem?
<br>
<p>Just curious.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
