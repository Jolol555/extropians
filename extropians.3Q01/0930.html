Probably my message to J.R. should have been private. I know I was
<br>
angry, and actually my message didn't convey what I wanted to at
<br>
all.
<br>
<p>To the hard-core deconstructionists out there, I suggest going out
<br>
and playing music or dancing or using some other means to turn off
<br>
your deconstructionalist tendencies. Please remember that we have
<br>
different value systems, different 'true' and 'untrue', different
<br>
experiences and so on. I don't agree that deconstructing the world
<br>
with science yields all answers possible. There are other ways to
<br>
learn and discover too.
<br>
<p>Can you tell me that you know all that is in your subconscious? Do
<br>
you learn from everything you can of what's around you? Have you
<br>
used every tool that seems useful in order to know? Do you find joy
<br>
and wonder and wisdom in what's around you?
<br>
<p>Lee was originally asking questions for definitions, so I did my
<br>
absolute best to find words (which mostly don't exist) to explain
<br>
some perspectives. He or J.R. can choose to accept it or not, and
<br>
ask questions to try to understand the different perspectives
<br>
better, but I must say that I was horrified and very dissapointed to
<br>
hear the immediate knee-jerk condemnations &quot;False&quot; that my way to try
<br>
to see what was in my subconscious to gain wisdom, be open to learn from
<br>
my environment, trying to bring me to a higher awareness  with what
<br>
life had to offer me. I don't find it 'false' at all that life has
<br>
a richness that I can't explain, and I'm doing my best to explore it
<br>
and learn about it in every way available to me.
<br>
<p>If my tools of discovery aren't your tools, then so what? I don't
<br>
like all of your tools either, nor does your way of 'discovering'
<br>
the world appeal to me (I see it as dry, rigid and not very fun,
<br>
to be honest), but I don't label your way as &quot;False&quot;.
<br>
<p><p>Ciao.
<br>
<p>Amara
