<em>&gt; &gt; It is now possible for someone to carry around a chip with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enough pre-recorded random bits in it to last longer than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone can type.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wish the bad guys WOULD do something this simple.  We would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to recover the chips from dead bodies and have a copy of the master code.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, SecureID has a pretty good solution to this.
<br>
<p>They have a device that generates random numbers for one-time keys.  Instead
<br>
of using a list, they actually use public/private key encryption with a
<br>
clock to generate a random generated time-of-day message.  It is encrypted
<br>
with the senders' private key and the recipients' public key so that only
<br>
the recipient can verify it, and they can verify that the sender was
<br>
correct.
<br>
<p>They also have a good physical security mechanism whereby the card is almost
<br>
impossible to open without destroying the data.  It is metal so it cannot be
<br>
x-rayed.  It has a battery that requires all parts to be in position to
<br>
maintain the charge to hold the memory active.  As soon as any piece is
<br>
moved slightly in relation to any other piece, the memory instantly lose
<br>
power and the data is lost.  It is so sensitive inside that any cutting,
<br>
x-raying, drilling and the like disrupts the circuit.  They might even have
<br>
vibration protections.  These cards have been compromised at great expense
<br>
to demonstrate that it is possible, but it is unlikely.
<br>
<p>Also, the encryption requires a user's memorized password plus the card's
<br>
random number generator.  They would have to get the password out of the
<br>
person and get the card.  Killing the person first wouldn't help.  They also
<br>
have panic codes, whereby the person can lie about their own password which
<br>
will cause the device to stop functioning.  There is no way to know whether
<br>
the password is correct or will permanently destroy the device ahead of
<br>
time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Very rarely.  If the NSA are watching a known terrorist, and he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmits a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picture of a puppy-dog, do you really think they won't know there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, there have been drug cases where the dealers used &quot;untraceable&quot;
<br>
e-mail to make deals.  The prosecutors didn't have to trace the e-mail, they
<br>
just noted that every few days an untraceable message was sent, and within
<br>
an hour each time a drug deal occurred.  This was statistically good enough
<br>
for them to show a cause-and-effect relationship without having to bother to
<br>
actually look at the email or prove where it went.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think you added the &quot;alone&quot; part.  Harvey was saying that steganography
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not add anything to encryption.  You might as well send
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encrypted text.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He was saying that embedding it in a picture buys you nothing.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it does buys you &quot;obscurity&quot;.  &quot;Security by obscurity&quot; is not bad.
<br>
It just is temporary.  It works fine while no one is suspicious or
<br>
investigating.  As soon as someone blabs, or someone starts investigating,
<br>
then they quickly find these things.
<br>
<p>It is fun to try to dream up these methods.  Everybody wants to be a hacker
<br>
and be able to get away with something.  Security research has been trying
<br>
to dream up these solutions for decades, and then spent decades cracking
<br>
them.  It is very unlikely that someone on this list will dream up an
<br>
uncrackable scheme in a few days when security experts have failed to do so
<br>
in the history of security.  As with any technical field, like AI,
<br>
nanotechnology, cryonics, life-extension, space travel, stock-market
<br>
investing, quantum physics, it always looks easier at first glance.  The
<br>
more you get into the technical details, the more complicated it becomes.
