<p>
<em>&gt; to get any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; troops to Afghanistan, we'd have to go through Pakistan. Would they let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us? Not likely. The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first. Will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other Muslim nations just stand by? You see where I'm going. We're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flirting with a world war between Islam and the West.
</em><br>
<p>Wonderful! After the war, gasoline will be 17 cents a gallon in the West, and
<br>
we can rebuild the WTC with the bones of dead religious fanatics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And guess what: that's Bin Laden's program. That's exactly what he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants. That's why he did this.
</em><br>
<p>Nonsense! He did this because he _could_ do it, and because he could _not_ do
<br>
it to Israel
<br>
-- they're too savvy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Read his speeches and statements. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all right there. He really believes Islam would beat the west.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, right. He couldn't even beat the west side of NY.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem ridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the West, he's got a billion soldiers.
</em><br>
<p>Ridiculous! Muslims are ready to hand him over now, if the US asks for his
<br>
wretched ass.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the west wreaks a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holocaust in those lands, that's a billion people with nothing left to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lose, that's even better from Bin Laden's point of view.
</em><br>
<p>That's why &quot;the west&quot; is not going to do any such thing. We're going to beat
<br>
them the same way we beat the other enemies of freedom, by showing them that
<br>
their oppressive system is incapable of success (besides being sick, wrong,
<br>
stupid, ugly, irresponsible and monstrous).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He's probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong, in the end the west would win, whatever that would mean
</em><br>
<p>&quot;probably&quot; wrong? Tamim Ansary: the new world's champion of understatement.
<br>
Yes, the west (spell that N - A - T - O) will definitely win, and it will mean
<br>
that we've proven that religious fanatics should all go to the imaginary
<br>
paradise that they so fervently believe in -- we're here to help.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war would last for years and millions would die, not just theirs but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ours. Who has the belly for that? Bin Laden does. Anyone else?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tamim Ansary
</em><br>
<p>OK, fess up... &quot;Tamim Ansary&quot; is actually Saddam Hussein, right?
<br>
You really think people in America are stupid enough to believe this bilge?
<br>
The US kicked the stuffing out of Iraq in '91, and where were the &quot;millions&quot;
<br>
of US casualties? Compared to Iraq and Saddam, Afghanistan and Bin Laden will
<br>
be like squashing a cockroach. Your propaganda is weaker than 3.2 beer,
<br>
&quot;Tamim&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values
<br>
<p><p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
