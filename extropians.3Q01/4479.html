RUSSIANS ANTICIPATE DOLLAR AND BUSH CRASH

<br>
<p>I received the piece below by Rachel Douglas from Dr. Edwin Vieira and obtained his permision to post to this site. For those of you
<br>
who don't know Dr. Vieira, he's probably the smartest man in this country on the money issue, hands down. If you'd like to read some
<br>
of his material, go to:

<br>
<p>Dr. Vieira had this to say about the article below:
<br>
<p>A Real life CrashMaker:
<br>
<p>&quot;The attachment describes present-day events in Russia that are an exact parallel of the Russian sub-plot in CRA$HMAKER. As
<br>
CRA$HMAKER was first copyrighted in October, 1998 (and actually written well before that), it turns out to be quite a prophecy. Now,
<br>
if only events here would shape up...&quot;

<p>Russians Anticipate Dollar and Bush Crash
<br>
<p>by Rachel Douglas
<br>
<p>&quot;Russia is getting ready for the dollar to crash. Preparedness measures have moved from the realm of published warnings, to concrete
<br>
actions, such as the Central Bank's decision to put the gold chervonets coin into circulation. The short-term purpose of that move
<br>
is to attract Russians' savings out of the dollar, and into the Russian chervonets, in a country where $100 billion or more is held
<br>
in cash (U.S. Federal Reserve Notes). Beyond that result, the Russian currency shift could become a stepping stone to more profound
<br>
changes in international monetary policyas nations seek safety from the disintegration of the Anglo-American-centered world
<br>
financial system. ...
<br>
<p>Note: last week a prediction was made that the dollar crash would begin in earnest on August 19th, 2001. It is foolish to attempt to
<br>
time the market, though this particular announcement could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<br>
<p>'Better than Bathroom Wallpaper It was the outspoken economist Tatyana Koryagina, who suggested in her testimony to Sergei Glazyev's
<br>
State Duma hearings on June 29 (EIR, July 6 and 20) that holders of dollars will soon be able to use them for nothing but
<br>
wallpapering their toilet stalls.
<br>
<p>Note: Probably a reference to Lenin's declaration (similar to Hitler's and FDR's) that Communists would use gold for their bathroom
<br>
fixtures.
<br>
<p>&quot;She was interviewed by the newspaper Pravda on July 12, about her forecasts of a mid-August blow-out of the entire world financial
<br>
system, the U.S. economy and the dollar first and foremost. Koryagina's forecast of an August U.S.-centered financial breakdown is
<br>
clearly being debated throughout Russia: July 16 saw press conferences by Economics Minister German Gref to claim that no financial
<br>
breakdown is threatening Russia; and by Duma markets committee chairman Andrei Shokhin to say that American authorities were taking
<br>
steps to prevent what Koryagina and LaRouche [and many others]forecast. &quot;
<br>
<p>Note: for example-
<br>
<p>&quot;The U.S. Reserve Assets report now excludes all reference to the ESF, and previous reports already published have been changed. Not
<br>
only were the figures adjusted, but all reference to the ESF has been eliminated. Reg Howe posted to his website:
<br>
<p>(<a href="http://www.goldensextant.com/commentary18.html#anchor12493">http://www.goldensextant.com/commentary18.html#anchor12493</a>)
<br>
<p>an excellent article addressing this change, and says: &quot;The figures could not be changed without a change in description, proof that
<br>
the earlier discrepancies were indeed on account of gold held by the ESF.&quot; Indeed.
<br>
<p>&quot;The Federal Reserve stopped mentioning the ESF in these reports in February. I guess the January 2001 report was already being
<br>
prepared when my December article appeared, so it was too late to change that report. Thus the U.S. Treasury has enlisted the
<br>
Federal Reserve as its partner in crime, as it is after all the Federal Reserve that prepares these reports. And what is that crime?
<br>
<p>&quot;Without any explanation to anyone (including Congress to my knowledge), the U.S. Treasury has taken steps that can be of no other
<br>
purpose and have no other intent but to hide the truth. The ESF has been erased out of the U.S. Reserve Assets report as if it never
<br>
previously existed. Thus, these new reports being prepared by the Federal Reserve (and up to now they had probably been prepared
<br>
this same way, since the ESF was formed in 1934) ensure that the American public will no longer see this gold-related activity by
<br>
the ESF.
<br>
<p>&quot;As I write this, I shake my head in disbelief. All I can think of are those old photographs showing sclerotic Soviet despots
<br>
standing on the parapets of the Kremlin, which would somehow miraculously and inexplicably change over the years depending on who
<br>
fell out of favor. Having had their erstwhile colleagues air-brushed out of those old photographs as well as Soviet history books,
<br>
those despots who survived the purge acted as if the truth never existed. Are our Treasury officials no better than that with their
<br>
apparent reckless disregard for the truth, air- brushing the ESF out of the Federal Reserve reports? Before you answer that question
<br>
consider also another recent damning action by the Treasury.
<br>
<p>&quot;This past April I wrote (Letter No. 283, &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot;) about the Treasury's unexplained reclassification of that part of
<br>
the U.S. Gold Reserve in the Treasury depository at West Point as &quot;Custodial Gold.&quot; Using minutes of the Federal Open Market
<br>
Committee of the Federal Reserve -- actually, very revealing minutes referring to &quot;gold swaps&quot; that apparently were inadvertently
<br>
not redacted before being made public -- and by other corroborating evidence, I suggested that the term &quot;Custodial Gold&quot; meant that
<br>
this part of the U.S. Gold Reserve had been swapped with gold owned by the Bundesbank.
<br>
<p>&quot;My assertion provoked controversy but no denial from the Treasury. Alarmingly, not only was the Treasury silent to me, its critics,
<br>
and others searching for the truth, the Treasury was apparently also silent to Congress. But recently, the Treasury has &quot;spoken.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Last month all of the U.S. Gold Reserve was reclassified. None of the gold stored at West Point, Fort Knox, and the other
<br>
depositories is called US Gold Reserve or even Custodial Gold. All of it is now labeled as &quot;Deep Storage Gold.&quot; This action raises a
<br>
lot of serious questions.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mr. Howe's lawsuit against the Fed, Greenspan, Summers, BIS, etc. is supposed to go to discovery on October 9th, 2001, three days
<br>
before Mr. Summers becomes presdent of Harvard. This entire affair has been an exemplary use of the internet to root out crimes of
<br>
the state.
<br>
<p>August 15th, 2001 was the 30th anniversary of Nixon's closing the gold window- making the US dollar irredeemable in gold and
<br>
ushering in the era of pure fiat-currency regimes. Any 30 year T-bonds denominated in gold have now expired, removing one of the
<br>
requirements for &quot;someone large buying&quot; to hold the gold price down. The dollar took a nasty hit that day-

<br>
<p>At any rate, what is of more interest going forward is the nature and structure of the post-dollar-reserve world. Some events are
<br>
easy to see coming- the next leg of the global stock market crash, which may already be in progress-
<br>
<a href="http://quote.yahoo.com/m2?u">http://quote.yahoo.com/m2?u</a>
<br>
the collapse of various other currenceis e.g. Argentina, Brazil now playing, the reduction in global trade and concurrent global
<br>
recession/depression, and of course the US (hyper)inflation.
