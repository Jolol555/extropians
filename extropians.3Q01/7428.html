Coming soon: the sensitive, caring computer

<br>
The latest development in computerised battle simulation used by the US
<br>
military is to program emotions into their virtual soldiers. &quot;Modelling
<br>
emotional responses to panic and fear is an area where everyone wants to go,&quot;
<br>
said Wayne Zachary, who works for Chi Systems in Philadelphia.
<br>
Eventually, computers with their own emotions could be standard. Dr Cindy
<br>
Mason from the University of California has designed software called EOP, or
<br>
emotionally oriented programming, which gives computers the ability to show
<br>
&quot;mood, temperament and feeling&quot;.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
