<em>&gt;From: &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20Future%20President?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108282115.OAA11848@well.com&gt;">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;You seem to have missed my original point.  Heston's speech
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clearly does not say the things I list.  It seems to imply these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things by references to certain words or by listing certain groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or by describing unspecified actions to be taken in the future. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I acknowledged in my very first post that I couldn't *prove* these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things by his words.  I felt that his words may evoke additional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideas in the audience that were not specifically stated.
</em><br>
<p>I was following your post very closely. I was trying to suggest at
<br>
every turn that there are good honest alternatives to every point
<br>
you were trying to make.
<br>
<p>The NRA has been heavily demonized for many years now, this of
<br>
course affects everything people hear from one of our members, much
<br>
more apparent when the president speaks.
<br>
<p>We are trying to apply the light of reasom here.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I can concede that this speech might have been intended to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against political correctness and not imply any negativity toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blacks, women, gays and other minorities.  I also can concede that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this was given to a group of predominately rich white males and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spoke to their point of view, and probably wasn't intended to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;addressed to other groups.
</em><br>
<p>Good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But, can you concede that all of his examples of bad situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and good situations were not evenly distributed among minority
</em><br>
<em>&gt;groups?  Maybe that is just a side-effect of how political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correctness works, but all his &quot;bad&quot; examples were about blacks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gays, feminists, transsexuals, transvestites, people with AIDS,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;liberals, etc., while all of his &quot;good&quot; examples were about white
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pride, gun-owners, conservatives, NRA members, etc.  Although he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may see all ethnic groups as equally good, his examples only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;showed one group as good whereas all the others were shown as bad. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Even if this was not intended, can you see where an implication
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might be derived from this?
</em><br>
<p>It was clearly a &quot;Rally round the flag and against the forces of
<br>
political correctness&quot; speech. Since the speech was removed from
<br>
it's original context I can see where the implication could be
<br>
derived.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Laws which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; seek to hire gays to achieve some sort of arbitrarily defined
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; multiculturality are also special treatment.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Please.  I will send you $100 if you can show me an actual enacted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;law that mandates quotas for hiring gays.  I think this is just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;straw-man argument. (Not invented by you.)  I'm sure you heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about this from a friend of a friend, but I think this is just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another urban legend.
</em><br>
<p>No, I remember press reports of Gay/Lesbian groups arguing for such
<br>
quotas, whether or not they've been granted I'll look up.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I support equal rights for gay/lesbians on marriage,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;cohabitation, insurance, joint tax returns, inheriting property,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;joint ownership
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of property etc, but not special treatment.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I agree totally.  I wish Heston had said this as clearly.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt;didn't mention giving gays any of these equal rights.  He only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mentioned blocking unspecified special treatment.  It is not clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from his speech if he supports any of these equal rights you list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;above.
</em><br>
<p>I would tend to think he would, guess I'll ask him some time. ;)
<br>
<p>Of course there are those who oppose this legally on religious
<br>
grounds. A good argument for seperation of church/state.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Your right, he did not specifically say that patients had a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; right to know, he said that a law which allowed dentists to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;conceal the fact that they were HIV-positive was wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The opposite of conceal is to reveal.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;This is the exact parallel that he uses in all his statements.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;am surprised that you see it here, but not elsewhere.  He gives an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example of something that is &quot;bad&quot;.  It is up to the audience to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpret what would be good.  As you point out, they will usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpret the opposite event to be &quot;good&quot; because &quot;good&quot; is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opposite of &quot;bad&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>He was pointing out things that were wrong, but I don't think he
<br>
implied the opposite was therefore true.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I fear that people will follow this same pattern when interpreting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his other examples.  When he says gays shouldn't be given more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights, someone might decide that they should be given less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights.  When he says whites need more pride, someone might decide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that blacks need less pride.  When he says liberals shouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;teach liberal propaganda in school, someone might decide that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conservatives should teach conservative propaganda instead.
</em><br>
<p>Theres no telling how it might be distorted, even well meaning
<br>
people might accomplish that. ;)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Busted! He was not giving a speech to the NRA, but to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Harvard  law school forum.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Agreed.  I referenced the wrong group here.  It was not germane to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my point.
</em><br>
<p>Okay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; At no point does he argue against free speech for certain songs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; teachers, or entertainers.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Perhaps, but his clearly brags about getting Ice-T's contract
</em><br>
<em>&gt;canceled because of the bad lyrics.  Someone could easily think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that improper speech should be stopped.
</em><br>
<p>I thought he made it clear that people who wrote songs advocating
<br>
killing cops should not be employed by the company of which he was
<br>
a stockholder.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You are inadvertently proving my point again.  Heston did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clearly say this.  The words you are insisting are a quote from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Heston are actually my words of what I thought he was implying. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you read the original speech, he doesn't say anything about not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;liking or cooperating with homosexuality. I just said that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people might think this was implied.  You apparently got confused
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with this same implication when you strongly asserted that Heston
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clearly said it.  I think the implication would be clear in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people's minds.  This is the exact kind of &quot;implied&quot; material that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concerns me.
</em><br>
<p>Oops! your right he didn't say any such thing, strike that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No.  But there does seem to be an unspecified agenda among these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;predominately rich white males that is causing them to prepare to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fight a culture war over differences in race (whatever that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;means).
</em><br>
<p>Actually a difference in speech, free vs politically correct
<br>
amongst others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I wouldn't call them secret, because they are well known.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wouldn't call them racist, because people here dispute what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;word means.  I do question the race-friendliness of a group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rich white males with white pride who refuse to call
</em><br>
<em>&gt;African-Americans anything but &quot;negros&quot; and are preparing for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cultural war over racial differences.  But you can use any term
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for this that you see fit.
</em><br>
<p>Actually he said King said &quot;negro&quot; he said they used the term
<br>
black. We are not fighting a cultural war over racial differences,
<br>
but things like free speech and gun control. He used the race
<br>
refferences to document the problems facing free speech advocates.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I will even concede that he was arguing against political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correctness.  But I don't think he was arguing for blacks, gays
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the like.  
</em><br>
<p><p>No, not in this speech, he was arguing against something (political
<br>
correct speech) and for something else (free speech).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I understand that you don't see this as inclusive, it probably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; was  not intended that way,  he was arguing that political 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; correctness is wrong, that advocates of free speech need to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a tough stand, and his speech was a shot across the bow of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we fight.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;This I agree with totally.  There is racial discrimination in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;directions.  There is sexual prejudice and unfairness to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genders and orientations.  I even agree with everything you claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the speech said.  I was worried over possible implications that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were not quite said, but possibly alluded to.  If these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;implications were there, I think you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;condemn them as I have.
</em><br>
<p>I agree totally that if the implication were there I would comdemn
<br>
them too.
<br>
<p>I think this was come have dinner and give a speech time, I'm quite
<br>
sure this was not for mass consumption.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;So on basics, I think we agree.  On this specific, we do not agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on how conservative or how liberal or exactly where Heston stands,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or more specifically exactly what this speech was intended to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accomplish.  I still fear the rhetoric calling for a cultural war
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over race, gender or sexual orientation, but on equal rights for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all I think we agree.
</em><br>
<p>I really don't think it was ever meant that way, I think Mr Heston
<br>
would be horrified to think anyone actually thought that. The
<br>
cultural war he is referring to is about the future of our culture,
<br>
I'll post an appropriate quote that may help explain tomorrow.
<br>
<p>Out of time
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Perhaps we can agree that the terminology relating to race, gender
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and sexual orientation have been so politicized and distorted that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we may not be reading the same meaning when we reach the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;words.  I'm not sure what more can be gained by discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Heston's individual speech.  I am more heartened by the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we seem to agree on equal rights for all, and no special rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for some.
</em><br>
<p>I agree completely.
