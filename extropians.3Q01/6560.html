<p>
The Day of Prayer and Remembrance
<br>
<p>I was envious, today, of all those who have someone to pray to...like many
<br>
here, I have only myself.
<br>
<p>The memorial held at noon today at Westlake Center in Seattle rallied around
<br>
the old-time favorites of God and Country, apparently Amara's Abyss has
<br>
consumed my soul, for I was able to call forth neither God nor Country today
<br>
to defend me or mine.
<br>
<p>Like many pro sports teams here, the game has been postponed, both the
<br>
defense and the offense have thrown their uniforms in the hamper, packed up
<br>
the duffel and gone to seek comfort in the only  church we know - home.
<br>
<p>So. It was a relief to &quot;just now&quot;  read this post from a friend:
<br>
<p>=====================================================
<br>
<p>To Everyone,
<br>
<p><p>This is poorly written, but it has been on my mind for the past two days:
<br>
<p>I mourn the passing of 6000 or more lives, like everyone else. I cry like
<br>
everyone else over this. I work through mourning, like everyone, and lose
<br>
sleep, watch the news, like everyone. And I support the elimination of
<br>
terrorism, coupled with a redistribution of wealth and communications on a
<br>
global scale, like many of us. This may be another story, or it may be the
<br>
same story.
<br>
<p>But I do not fly an American flag, wear red white and blue; this tragedy
<br>
does not make me patriotic, only sad. I fear patriotism and leadership; I
<br>
fear nationalism which all too often degenerates into further drawings of
<br>
lines, further ignorance, further racisms.
<br>
<p>I fear, in other words, the calls to the flag, the calls to Americanism,
<br>
the calls to patriotism.
<br>
<p>And I do not seek vengance or violence, and I deplore the rhetoric of war,
<br>
vengance, and violence dominating the news. I resent the transformation of
<br>
tragedy into this rhetoric, mourning into firearms.
<br>
<p>I fear, in other words, the calls for war, the calls for vengance, the
<br>
violence already enacted against Arabs in our streets.
<br>
<p>I do not pray to God, to any God, and I resent the implications that this
<br>
should be our means of dealing with the tragedy, or coming together as a
<br>
nation.
<br>
<p>I fear, in other words, the call to religion, even for those of us who
<br>
have no belief, no religion, no desire to create even more havoc in the
<br>
names of gods who can only be unjust.
<br>
<p>A lot of us find our country turning away from us, just as it turns to
<br>
war, nationalism, flags, patriotism, and vengance above all. Eliminating
<br>
terrorism is one thing - the rhetoric and all it implies, is something
<br>
else again, incredibly dangerous. The tragedy did not make me feel &quot;more
<br>
an American&quot; - if anything, it makes me feel more an internationalist than
<br>
ever - so many foreign citizens were also killed. And if the Net has
<br>
taught us anything, it is that ultimately we will all rise and fall
<br>
together, not separated by boundaries tempered only by the vagaries of
<br>
history.
<br>
<p>We already see the result of the rhetoric in the violence against Arabs,
<br>
or anyone appearing &quot;Arab-looking,&quot; across the United States.
<br>
<p>Let us do whatever we can to endure. But let us also speak out, with care,
<br>
on and off the Net, before we are all silenced.
<br>
<p>And let us mourn.
<br>
<p>Alan
