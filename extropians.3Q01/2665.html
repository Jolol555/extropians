<p>Godawmighty, you work your fingers to the bone, and then--   :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From THE SPIKE:
</em><br>
============================
<br>
Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create
<br>
superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Vernor Vinge, NASA VISION-21 Symposium, 1993)
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Why this curious and unfamiliar term `singularity'? It's a mathematical
<br>
point where analysis breaks down, where infinities enter an equation. ...
<br>
`The term &quot;singularity&quot; tied to the notion of radical change is very
<br>
evocative,' Vinge told me, adding: `I used the term &quot;singularity&quot; in the
<br>
sense of a place where a model of physical reality fails. (I was also
<br>
attracted to the term by one of the characteristics of many singularities
<br>
in General Relativity--namely the unknowability of things close to or in
<br>
the singularity.).'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Vinge, accelerating trends in computer sciences converge somewhere
<br>
between 2030 and 2100 to form a wall of technological novelties blocking
<br>
the future from us. However hard we try, we cannot plausibly imagine what
<br>
lies beyond that wall. `My &quot;technological singularity&quot; is really quite
<br>
limited,' Vinge told me. `I say that it seems plausible that in the near
<br>
historical future, we will cause superhuman intelligences to exist.
<br>
Prediction beyond that point is qualitatively different from futurisms of
<br>
the past. I don't necessarily see any vertical asymptotes.' So enthusiasts
<br>
for this perspective (including me) are taking the idea much farther than
<br>
Vinge. Humanity, it is argued, will become first `transhuman' and then
<br>
`posthuman'. 
<br>
<p>======================
<br>
Then there's the rest of the book.
