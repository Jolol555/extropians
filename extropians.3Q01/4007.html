Here's an example of the sort of research I'd like to see much more of. The
<br>
research of Wang et al on the genetics of domestic corn (maize) and teosinte
<br>
could lead to perennial grain crops. It turns out that domestic corn and
<br>
wild teosinte (ancestor of domestic corn) are genetically extremely close.
<br>
Certain sub-species of teosinte are perennial. Now that the genes have been
<br>
identified, the difficulty in developing perennial corn will be in
<br>
preserving the perennial nature of the wild sub-species while engineering
<br>
for the huge seed heads characteristic of domestic corn.
<br>
<p>The article below is what you might call pure research, in that the
<br>
researchers were interested in the domestication of maize that took place
<br>
5000 - 10000 years ago. At the end of this post, I'll link to an article
<br>
that shows some of the practical appllications of this research.

<br>
<p>The domestication of all major crop plants occurred during a brief period in
<br>
human history about 10,000 years ago1. During this time, ancient
<br>
agriculturalists selected seed of preferred forms and culled out seed of
<br>
undesirable types to produce each subsequent generation. Consequently,
<br>
favoured alleles at genes controlling traits of interest increased in
<br>
frequency, ultimately reaching fixation. When selection is strong,
<br>
domestication has the potential to drastically reduce genetic diversity in a
<br>
crop. To understand the impact of selection during maize domestication, we
<br>
examined nucleotide polymorphism in teosinte branched1, a gene involved in
<br>
maize evolution2. Here we show that the effects of selection were limited to
<br>
the gene's regulatory region and cannot be detected in the protein-coding
<br>
region. Although selection was apparently strong, high rates of
<br>
recombination and a prolonged domestication period probably limited its
<br>
effects. Our results help to explain why maize is such a variable crop. They
<br>
also suggest that maize domestication required hundreds of years, and
<br>
confirm previous evidence that maize was domesticated from Balsas teosinte
<br>
of southwestern Mexico.

<p><p>Natural Systems Agriculture
<br>
A Conversation with Jon K. Piper
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Jon K. Piper has been the ecologist at The Land Institute since 1985, where
<br>
he teaches classes and directs the program in Natural Systems Agriculture.
<br>
He holds a degree in biology from Bates College and a Ph.D. in botany from
<br>
Washington State University. Piper has received grants from the National
<br>
Science Foundation, the Eppley Foundation for Research, and the Charles A.
<br>
Lindbergh Foundation. He has published over 25 scientific articles and
<br>
co-authored Farming in Nature's Image with Judith Soule.
<br>
<p><p>What is Natural Systems Agriculture? What elements does it draw from ecology
<br>
and what does it take from agriculture?
<br>
<p>Research in Natural Systems Agriculture represents a new synthesis between
<br>
ecology and agriculture, with a goal to develop grain agricultural systems
<br>
that function like natural ecosystems. Because the practice of agriculture
<br>
has changed the face of the Earth more than any other human activity, the
<br>
time is ripe for such a synthesis. This research is attracting increasing
<br>
attention from both ecologists and agronomists, who have previously worked
<br>
in isolation, or even at cross purposes.
<br>
<p>Since 1976, The Land Institute has been investigating the feasibility of a
<br>
grain agriculture that protects topsoil and does not rely on environmentally
<br>
hazardous fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides. The long-term goal is
<br>
to find combinations of perennial plants that, when planted together, will
<br>
provide the restorative properties of a year-round cover as well as yielding
<br>
significant amounts of edible grain. Grain-producing mixtures of perennial
<br>
grasses, legumes, and sunflowers would mimic the vegetation structure and
<br>
ecological function of native grassland ecosystems in some fundamental ways.
<br>
<p>In what ways are the systems created by Natural Systems Researchers like
<br>
naturally occurring ecosystems?
<br>
<p>Natural systems, such as grasslands, have two important features that can
<br>
contribute to sustainability. First, such systems are composed primarily of
<br>
perennial plants, which protect and improve soil quality over time, maintain
<br>
soil biodiversity, promote nutrient cycling, reduce weed growth, and support
<br>
populations of beneficial insects. Second, natural systems comprise diverse
<br>
arrays of plant species. Benefits of biodiversity include nitrogen supplied
<br>
by legumes, management of insects that prey on crops, reduction of some
<br>
plant diseases, and ecosystem resilience. The research in Natural Systems
<br>
Agriculture aims to provide the ecosystem-level benefits of a diverse,
<br>
prairie-like vegetative structure using mixtures of high-yielding edible
<br>
grains.
<br>
<p>How will Natural Systems Agriculture help to protect the environment?
<br>
<p>During the last few decades, about one third of the world's arable land area
<br>
has been lost through soil erosion. Although modern agricultural methods are
<br>
highly productive, they are sustainable only as long as topsoil is intact
<br>
and fossil fuel supplies are affordable. With topsoil on roughly 90 percent
<br>
of U.S. cropland being lost faster than it is being formed, we need to
<br>
rethink agriculture in terms of preserving this limited &quot;ecological
<br>
capital.&quot; Natural Systems Agriculture will help prevent soil erosion by
<br>
providing a year round cover for cropland, protecting topsoil from short
<br>
periods of heavy rain or high wind, which is when unprotected land loses
<br>
most of its topsoil.
<br>
<p>There are two types of problems associated with soil erosion, on-site and
<br>
off-site effects. The on-site effects of erosion include reduced
<br>
productivity and increased input costs to farmers to compensate for lowered
<br>
soil fertility and water-holding capacity. It has been estimated that 10
<br>
percent of all energy used in U.S. agriculture is expended simply to offset
<br>
the losses of soil nutrients and water caused by erosion.
<br>
<p>Soil loss from cropland has severe consequences off-site as well. The major
<br>
effect is surface water pollution due to sediment deposition, pesticide
<br>
residues, and nutrient loading from chemical fertilizers and animal manure.
<br>
Sediment load both reduces surface water quality and increases the
<br>
likelihood of flooding, while nitrates from fertilizer and pesticides in
<br>
drinking water pose a human health risk. If estimated off-site and on-site
<br>
costs of soil erosion are combined, the total cost to the U.S. may be in the
<br>
billions.
<br>
<p>Several promising plant species have been identified as good candidates for
<br>
Natural Systems Agriculture. These species include wild perennials that may
<br>
undergo selection for improved seed yield, as well as annual grain crops
<br>
into which the perennial habit could be introduced.
<br>
<p>How can we &quot;introduce&quot; the perennial habit into annual crops or screen wild
<br>
perennials for improved seed yields?
<br>
<p>Two recent insights are particularly relevant. The first is the finding that
<br>
a relatively small number of genes accounts for a large proportion of the
<br>
observed variation between wild and domesticated plants. John Doebley has
<br>
shown that genes located in five particular stretches of DNA account for
<br>
most of the considerable differences in shape between corn (maize) and the
<br>
Central American grass teosinte. This suggests that a relatively few
<br>
mutations, with large effects, may be responsible for most of the
<br>
differences between domesticated and wild-type plants.
<br>
<p>The second insight concerns recent discoveries of the high level of
<br>
similarity in the genetic constitutions of various grasses as well as the
<br>
fact that the genes coding for such traits as seed size, shattering, and
<br>
daylength sensitivity are positioned very closely to one another. Because
<br>
these genes are so close to each other on the chromosome, chances are good
<br>
that as plant species evolved these genes moved together from species to
<br>
evolving species. This raises the possibility that genes in different
<br>
species, such as some cereals and wild grasses, may be identical.
<br>
<p>If some of these genes are identical, the daunting time frame for developing
<br>
perennial grains may be shortened considerably because these genes could
<br>
then be moved easily and quickly through breeding or genetic engineering.
<br>
This would allow us to bring together the most agriculturally desirable
<br>
traits from wild perennials and domesticated crops in a shorter time frame
<br>
than would otherwise be necessary.
<br>
<p>What is the greatest challenge that faces the implementation of Natural
<br>
Systems Agriculture?
<br>
<p>Although interest in the potential and feasibility of perennial grains has
<br>
increased substantially in recent years, on-farm use of perennial grain
<br>
systems is still several years down the road. A common objection raised
<br>
regarding the development of perennial grains is the assumption that a plant
<br>
cannot simultaneously invest in both large/numerous seeds and the vegetative
<br>
organs required for the perennial growth habit. This assumption has been
<br>
challenged by several studies that have shown that, within the ranges
<br>
investigated, there are no strict &quot;trade-offs&quot; between increased seed yield,
<br>
vegetative growth, and the likelihood of future reproduction.
<br>
<p>Another objection concerns the expected long-term time frame needed to
<br>
develop high-yielding perennial grains. As mentioned above, if the
<br>
preliminary research in genetics pans out, this time frame could be
<br>
significantly shortened.
