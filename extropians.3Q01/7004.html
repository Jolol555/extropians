<p>This has been SOP on all British flights -- including domestic ones --
<br>
for many years, now: the plane doesn't fly unless every suitcase in 
<br>
the hold has a corresponding passenger in the cabin. Try leaving a
<br>
flight at the last minute and the airline will probably sue you for the
<br>
cost of a lost take-off slot and the idle time costs of an airliner --
<br>
which at a busy airport may run into many thousands of dollars.
<br>
<p>Other little standard security procedures in force at British airports
<br>
for many years _before_ the bombing included metal detector checks,
<br>
body searches, random luggage hand-searches, and security guards who act
<br>
like professionals. Which is not surprising, as they're paid for by the
<br>
airport authority, which would be held liable and sued by the airlines
<br>
in event of a hijacking. There is no 'airline security' as such, just
<br>
airport security -- which is held to a much higher standard and is not
<br>
subject to direct cost-cutting pressures due to competition with other
<br>
airlines.
<br>
<p>The idea is to view security as being an infrastructure function, not a
<br>
bolt-on afterthought added by the carrier. But then, the UK has had to
<br>
learn how to deal with a low-level terrorist threat over many years;
<br>
nobody wanted to see the IRA get into the hijacking game, and Heathrow
<br>
has been repeatedly targeted by middle eastern hijackers.
