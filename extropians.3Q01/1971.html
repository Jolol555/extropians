<p>I think that there is a significant degree of conflict between europe
<br>
and the US/Canada/Japan coalition, though I think that it is good to see
<br>
Berlusconi seeking to break away from the european consensus on at least
<br>
some things like NMD. Europe seems to wish to retain its agricultural
<br>
protectionist policies. I think that this is primarily because the
<br>
european system is generally uncompetetive with the US and Canada, and
<br>
thus at a disadvantage. If it is to become competetive, it must abandon
<br>
many of its remaining left wing policies (which, you'll note, Berlusconi
<br>
doesn't quite share in).
<br>
<p>Now, the interesting thing about the environmental aspects, you might
<br>
note, is that the europeans are still quite shrill about the US taking
<br>
on the bulk of the cost of the Kyoto agreement. Note that this means
<br>
that we are expected to pay more in energy taxes to pay for our
<br>
sequestration costs. With increased taxation, producers can increase
<br>
prices above and beyond this margin, and who is it that exports more
<br>
oil? Northern, socialist, europe, which funds its welfare state off of
<br>
oil revinues. If oil prices in the US go up, who makes more money? The
<br>
northern european oil countries that need more money from oil sales to
<br>
fund the baby boomers retirements coming up in another decade.
<br>
<p>Now, you'd think: why would the northern european countries be for more
<br>
taxes on oil? WOuld this not decrease consumption? Only if sequestration
<br>
were not part of the picture. Because CO2 cannot be sequestered very
<br>
efficiently (unless, of course it is a forest doing it, but the euros
<br>
don't want us to count that), you must burn more energy separating the
<br>
oxygen from the carbon so you can store the carbon away. What this means
<br>
is that we are going to have to consume oil at a far faster rate in
<br>
order to sequester the carbon like the euros want us to do, thus
<br>
increasing demand, and thus increasing oil profits, thus fattening the
<br>
welfare cofferes of northern european countries.
<br>
<p>And did I mention it is these same countries funding opposition to our
<br>
exploiting the Alaskan North Slope????? I wonder why?
