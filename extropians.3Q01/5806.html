On the adaptive landscape of economics
<br>
<a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/technology/96207/page5.html">http://www.strategy-business.com/technology/96207/page5.html</a>
<br>
Sure, writes Mr. Kauffman in his new book, we can't understand every detail of
<br>
evolution, every reason behind every part of every species. Remember the
<br>
butterfly effect. &quot;We must instead simply stand back and watch the pageant,&quot;
<br>
he advises. Beneath the details, he writes, can be &quot;deep and beautiful laws
<br>
governing that unpredictable flow.&quot; Many &quot;features of organisms and their
<br>
evolution are profoundly robust and insensitive to details,&quot; he argues.
<br>
<p>Maybe so, but in science, as in management, there is always a rival strain.
<br>
Some people delight in detail. They will fight generalization as an effort to
<br>
throw the baby out with the bathwater. A law broad enough to explain sandpiles
<br>
and corporations and starfish, they will argue, will have the sandiness and
<br>
corporate culture and starfishiness (Abstract)ed out of it, so that it says
<br>
nothing important. One of the most extreme examples of this kind of scientific
<br>
mind was probably Dr. Alfred Kinsey, who was a student of wasps before he
<br>
turned to human sexuality. Asked what he could say about the wasp in general,
<br>
after decades in which he had examined hundreds of thousands of different
<br>
insects, he replied that he hadn't yet seen enough specimens to generalize.
<br>
<p>The detail people are not always wrong. As with all intellectually alluring
<br>
fads, complexity theory is in for a backlash, and it may have already started.
<br>
<p>In its June 1995 issue, for instance, Scientific American asked, &quot;Is
<br>
Complexity a Sham?&quot; Building on a paper published in Science in 1994,
<br>
Scientific American's veteran writer John Horgan argued that the main tool
<br>
used by complexologists--the computer simulation--is an inherently flawed
<br>
method for understanding the world.
<br>
<p>The paper, by the philosopher Naomi Oreskes and two colleagues, argues that
<br>
because our knowledge of &quot;real world&quot; phenomena will always be partial, we can
<br>
never verify with certainty that a computer model represents the world. Mr.
<br>
Horgan, noting that some scientists have given up on the chaos and complexity
<br>
hype, argues that complexity may join catastrophe theory, cybernetics and
<br>
information theory on the ash-heap of ideas that, whatever their utility in
<br>
their own spheres, were once touted as all-powerful explanations.
<br>
<p>Not entirely convinced, but interested, a number of the leading research
<br>
consulting firms are looking into complexity's possibilities.
<br>
<p>Mr. Kauffman himself acknowledges the skeptics. &quot;The consulting community is
<br>
filled with fad after fad,&quot; he says. &quot;You have to use caution, because this is
<br>
a new science. Whenever humanity invents a new widget, we try to apply it to
<br>
everything. Then things settle down and it gets used for what it's appropriate
<br>
for. They tried foxglove as a cure for everything before they settled down to
<br>
using digitalis for heart disease.&quot;
<br>
<p>But whatever complexity's long-term legacy turns out to be, the skeptics have
<br>
some explaining of their own to do if they mean to turn the tide of opinion
<br>
this early in the game. Just what do they make of the success of the
<br>
hardworking paint booths of Fort Wayne, Ind.?
