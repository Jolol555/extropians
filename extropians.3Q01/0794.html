<em>&gt;     This is the 41'st update of my fly longevity experiments. Except
</em><br>
<p>Is this up on the web anywhere in totality? Anyone raising flies has my
<br>
admiration.
<br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, damn. It would seem that the preponderance of old folk in the
<br>
Devonshire pubs is actually due to cider. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     My personal testing of the satiating ability of various foods has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continued. This time I tried a low carb approach, by eating nothing but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; white chicken breast meat for a day. Ad libitum intake was 1478 calories,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is no different from other low palatability foods. Switching to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unsalted roasted peanuts increased intake significantly to 2689
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calories. However there was evidence of malabsorption with this food, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true calorie intake would have been lower than this figure. Unfortunately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I made the mistake of trying malvia verticellata tea on the day I tried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peanuts. This tea has a reputation for causing malabsorption. I couldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help but think about how common severe peanut allergies have become in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last several decades. The peanuts I ate would have killed an entire school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bus load of peanut sensitive children. When I was a child, nobody that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was aware of had any peanut allergies. Such is no longer the case.
</em><br>
<p>I'm one of the allergic folks. It's pretty unpleasant. Interestingly enough,
<br>
I get the same reaction from uncooked sunflower kernels -- but not from the
<br>
roasted version.
<br>
<p>Not eating nuts and being pseudo-vegetarian makes a paleolithic diet kinda
<br>
hard for me, especially when you start throwing CR into the mix. Still, it's
<br>
an adventure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     Up till now, with the exception of Astro's no-fat fruit yogurt, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foods with a strong taste had been tested. I decided to try a highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; palatable calorically dense food, to see if intake would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modified. Entering stage right is Christie's Chips Ahoy chocolate chip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cookies. I included 568 calories of chili, so as avoid a protein deficit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but ate an unbelievable additional 3487 calories from the cookies, for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; total daily intake of 4055 calories with cookies and chili! It appears
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that high palatability and high caloric density have a potent synergistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect on calorie intake. I am incredulous at the large difference in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calorie intake between cookies, and yogurt.
</em><br>
<p>That, I can sympathise with. My anecdotal evidence is that mixing anything
<br>
that involves starch and processed sugar into the mix just makes you want
<br>
eat more. And makes you more prone to depression, mood swings, etc.
<br>
<p>I'd be happy to share my CR/dietary experiences with the list if there's
<br>
interest in that sort of thing here. I consider my efforts pretty successful
<br>
to day (BMI down to 22.2 from 26.5 over the last 4 months, and aiming at
<br>
19.5 or so).
