reveals the decline. I should say the journalist who wrote it has been a bit
<br>
sloppy - the figure of 2% in the 1912 Inspectors' Report refers to complete
<br>
illiteracy, not &quot;functional illiteracy&quot;. However only 5% of children in 1912
<br>
were found to have &quot;minimal ability&quot; in reading and writing which
<br>
correspondes to our &quot;functional illiteracy&quot;. It is worth pointing out that
<br>
the study finds a marked decline in literacy below the age of 35 as compared
<br>
to above it. This suggests that there is more afoot here than a simple
<br>
matter of &quot;state schools bad, private schools good&quot; (after all the literate
<br>
and numerate 40-60 year olds were mostly educated in state schools). There
<br>
has clearly been a major decline in educational attainment in Britain and
<br>
the US in the last 30-40 years, despite large increases in spending per
<br>
pupil over that period. What has caused this? I don't know for sure, I
<br>
suspect the process Mike Lorrey talks about is a major factor, as are daft
<br>
teaching methods and the &quot;all must have prizes&quot; attitude of so many parents
<br>
and teachers. I think the principal cause however is the impact of TV. Does
<br>
this matter ? I believe it does (and not just because I'm in the education
<br>
business). I'm a strong believer in the old Scottish idea of the &quot;democratic
<br>
intellect&quot;, that a liberal and democratic society can only work properly
<br>
when there is a citizenry with a liberal education which gives everyone the
<br>
power to think critically. (I'm with Brian on this). In an age of moral
<br>
panics and pseudo-science this is more vital than ever. Steve Davies

<p><p>The reading and writing skills of Britain's young people are worse than they
<br>
were before the First World War, according to research released yesterday.
<br>
<p>Despite the Government's efforts to improve the nation's literacy skills,
<br>
the study found that 15 per cent of people aged 15 to 21 are 'functionally
<br>
illiterate'. In 1912, school inspectors reported that only 2 per cent of
<br>
young people were unable to read or write.
<br>
<p>The findings of the researchers, led by Professor Loreto Todd at the
<br>
University of Ulster, echo statistics produced by the National Skills Task
<br>
Force last year, which estimated that seven million adults were functionally
<br>
illiterate.
<br>
<p>The study also found a high level of arrogance among the 15- to 21-year-olds
<br>
surveyed. Seven out of 10 believed they were 'pretty good' at getting words
<br>
right. But when they were asked to spot 14 mistakes in a piece of text, none
<br>
were able to identify them all. Girls did better than boys - as they have
<br>
been doing in exams for more than a decade - but were still unable to
<br>
pinpoint more than two-thirds of the mistakes correctly.
<br>
<p>Boys only managed to spot 54 per cent of the mistakes. Despite this, men
<br>
were more likely to rate themselves as 'excellent' spellers than women.
<br>
<p>With GCSE results - including those for English language - being published
<br>
next week, the findings suggest that there is a stubborn section of school
<br>
leavers left untouched by attempts to give them even the most basic skills.
<br>
<p>The Government has promised to spend millions of pounds on improving adult
<br>
literacy, and the study showed that young people were aware of the damage an
<br>
inability to spell can do. Seven out of 10 said poor spellers were seen as
<br>
'careless, young, immature and unreliable'.
<br>
<p>Despite this, the research - which was commissioned by Bloomsbury, the
<br>
publishing house - suggested that spelling skills are getting worse. When
<br>
presented with the same word spelt slightly differently three times, 90 per
<br>
cent of 41- to 50-year-olds got the right answer, compared with just 65 per
<br>
cent of 15- to 30-year-olds.
<br>
<p>Older people were also unimpressed with the craze for mobile phone text
<br>
messaging, believing it caused spelling to deteriorate.
<br>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Education and Skills said: 'Last year
<br>
99 per cent of all 15-year-olds in schools who took GCSE English passed it
<br>
and have the equivalent of functional literacy or above.'
