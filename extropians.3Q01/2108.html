<em>&gt;&gt; But the statistics I've read for Argentina show a continued
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; increase in income concentration on behalf of the 10% or so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of the population that forms the upper class.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Can you also claim that the increase in *concentration* among
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the upper clase takes place without the other classes actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;becoming better off (in real terms) too?
</em><br>
<p>I think I can. According to our National Institute of Statistics
<br>
and Census 'Permanent Home Inquiry 99', in the Great Buenos Aires
<br>
zone (the richest part of the country, and home to about 30%
<br>
of the total population), the upper class experienced an income
<br>
increase of 5%, while the middle and lower classes experienced
<br>
an income reduction of 10% during that year. Gini coefficients
<br>
for income distribution has gone from 0.365 to 0.439 since 1980.
<br>
The poorest 20 percent of the population has seen their mass
<br>
income reduce from 4.6% ot total to 3.9% of total since 1989.
<br>
I can't find the rise for the richest 20 percent (I think it
<br>
was around 45-50% of the total mass income at 1989), but
<br>
the Inquiry 99 shows them getting the 55.2% of the total mass
<br>
income at that moment. These figures are mentioned in a recent
<br>
paper by Laura Tedesco in the Bulletin of Latin American Research
<br>
19, pp. 527-545.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I claim that an *increase* in the *concentration* of top-class
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wealth is a positive sign, because (I also claim) it is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;historically well-correlated with general advances in society
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and richer economies.
</em><br>
<p>No dispute there. The upper classes can get as rich as they want
<br>
or are able to, it will certainly help the country unless they don't
<br>
re-invest their earnings (as they are culturally prone to do, to the
<br>
happiness of bankers in Switzerland and the Caribbean havens).
<br>
On the other hand I think there is nothing possitive when it happens
<br>
at the same time (due to, if one gets paranoid?) the lower classes not
<br>
getting any of the benefits for the privatizations and the pseudo-free
<br>
markets so created. In this case, the situation seems to be even
<br>
worse, as the lower classes have seen their income reduced in very
<br>
real terms.
