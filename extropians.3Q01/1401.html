<em>&gt; Further to that global warming thread, is the rise in ocean water level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the biggest foreseen problem associated with it? What are the others? Are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there benefits on the other side of the ledger?
</em><br>
<p>There are significant benefits. For example, the Siberian and Canadian
<br>
tundra would become far more settleable, and could become the
<br>
breadbaskets of the world. The recent opening of the Northwest Passage
<br>
over north America for commercial sea traffic cuts 5,000 nautical miles
<br>
off of the sea passage between Europe and Japan, with its commensurate
<br>
savings in both shipping costs and transit time, and less dependence
<br>
upon the Panama Canal as a strategic choke point.
<br>
<p>Additionally, rainfall in the Sahara and central asia should increase
<br>
measurably, leading to the reversal of the deforestation trends of the
<br>
last century in those areas.
<br>
<p>Even the interruption of the thermal conveyor from polar to equatorial
<br>
waters could potentially be of benefit, with the current based system
<br>
possibly giving way to a system of many more localized upwellings colder
<br>
fresher water and subsidence of high heat and saline waters. The
<br>
recently discovered phenomena of a heat vent in the central pacific as
<br>
the primal engine of thermal transfer there is related to the relative
<br>
lack of precipitation there under high temp conditions, could result in
<br>
Pacific currents developing in a radial fashion, drawing heat toward the
<br>
central pacific as hot air rises to vent its heat to space, with the
<br>
resulting winds influencing local water currents, and drawing cold water
<br>
up from the depths near the coastlines, which would lead to booms in
<br>
coastal oceanlife.
