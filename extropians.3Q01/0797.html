<p>I assumed that the effect Flynn noticed was that school &amp; college &amp; maybe
<br>
military-entry tests showed increasing scores over time; like was matched
<br>
against earlier like, and most IQ tests are surely applied to kids.
<br>
However, Google implies otherwise, e.g.:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sigmaxi.org/amsci/articles/97articles/nflynn.html">http://www.sigmaxi.org/amsci/articles/97articles/nflynn.html</a>
<br>
<p>&lt; In an influential series of papers, Flynn showed that the increasing raw
<br>
scores appear on every major test, in
<br>
every age range and in every modern industrialized country. &gt;
<br>
<p>But:
<br>
<p>&lt; In virtually every instance, the subjects achieved higher scores on the
<br>
older version of a test. For example, in David Wechsler's own study of his
<br>
revised adult test--the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised
<br>
(WAIS-R)--a group of subjects who averaged 103.8 on the new WAIS-R had a
<br>
mean of 111.3 on the older WAIS. This implies that the actual IQ-test
<br>
performance of adults rose by 7.5 points between 1953 (when the old WAIS
<br>
was standardized) and 1978 (when the WAIS-R was standardized), which is a
<br>
rate of about 0.3 IQ points per year. &gt;
<br>
<p>Which adults? All of them? But again, how many 40 year olds and 60 year
<br>
olds do Wechsler tests? (Those hired to provide fodder for norming and
<br>
validating, I guess.)
