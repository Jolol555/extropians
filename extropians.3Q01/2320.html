<p>Actually, I agree that cryonics has produced results.  That is why I have
<br>
been signed up with Alcor for about a decade.  The question I meant to imply
<br>
was what percentage of people, doctors or scientists would agree that
<br>
cryonics has produced results.  Even obvious scientific results are not
<br>
always obvious to everyone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Extropy is not a religion, but cryonics tries very hard to be one.
</em><br>
<p>I have been thinking about this lately.  Religions are attractive because
<br>
they promise us what we want.  Political movements are similar.  Now that we
<br>
have decided that science is the best hope for our goals, we choose science.
<br>
But the goals are still the same.
<br>
<p>We can switch from faith in an afterlife to scientific research to revive
<br>
cryonics patients.  We can switch from a divine sense of purpose to a global
<br>
sense of history or evolution or progress.  We can switch from an overseeing
<br>
god to an overseeing market system or humanity or scientific community.
<br>
<p>We are addressing the same purposes that religion serves, and are trying to
<br>
achieve the same goals that religionists desire.  It makes sense that a
<br>
developed scientific system starts to look like a religion or political
<br>
system.  The difference is not in dogma, purpose, goals or organization.
<br>
The difference is in the scientific methodology.  We use different methods.
