<em>&gt; The problem, as I see it, is that these CEOs don't deserve a raise for these

</em><br>
<p>I think this view misses a few things.  No CEO enjoys laying off
<br>
employees.  It is one of the toughest and most delicate tasks
<br>
that a CEO can face.  But it is the CEO's job (and why he makes
<br>
the big bucks) to make even hard and personally painful choices
<br>
for the good of the company he was hired to lead.  If the
<br>
business climate changes and many projects that people were
<br>
hired for simply will not fly in the current climate and when
<br>
they will is unknown there is little good sense in keeping the
<br>
people on if they cannot be integrated into other projects
<br>
likely to be successful.  And this is only one of many, many
<br>
scenarios that could make layoffs a necessity for the health of
<br>
the organization.
<br>
<p>A business is not in business primarily to give its employees
<br>
employment.  It is primarily in business to be a profitable,
<br>
successful enterprise within certain stated company objectives. 
<br>
It is the CEO's job to ensure this success to the maximum of
<br>
his/her abilities.  It is a tough job.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True cost-cutting occurs when a new efficient method is found to produce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same services cheaper.  If a company were to announce some major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breakthrough technology that allows them to do more with less, this would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true cost-cutting.  They then could cut jobs while maintaining productivity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This would decrease the cost-to-benefit ration and product more profits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is nonsense.  The organization must grow and shrink in
<br>
response to the environment and its needs.  To produce this
<br>
breakthrough technology may take more resources than the company
<br>
can afford for longer than the company can remain viable at a
<br>
loss.  It may require tying up resources that could be used to
<br>
competitive advantage to insure the company even stays in the
<br>
game.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; But when a company cannot compete in the market or spends more to produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its services than they are worth, this company is failing.  Such a company
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is destroying resources without adding value.  Simply laying off employees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without a new methodology won't change the cost-to-benefit ratio.  
</em><br>
<p>Layoff employees that you can no longer gainfully keep is
<br>
logical and utterly necessary to the health of the company and
<br>
to the continued employment of the rest of the employees.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;By
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cutting resources and using the same methods, these companies are cutting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costs and benefits.  These CEOs are in effect saying that since they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroying value rather than creating value, the best course is for them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do as little as possible.  They aren't making more with less.  They are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making less with less to minimize the impacts of their value destruction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, this is largely false.  During hard times various
<br>
means of cost-cutting and changes of working methodologies are
<br>
put into place. But a company in survival mode is unlikely to
<br>
have enough staff and resources to find brand new methodologies,
<br>
not for lack of trying.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Such a company is destroying resources with no net benefits.  Such a CEO is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failing at the job.  Claiming that this course of action is &quot;cost-cutting&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or &quot;profit-making&quot; is simply fraud.  Such a CEO is defrauding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stock-holders and is driving up debt to line his own pockets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This is BS.  Try the job yourself some time and see what you
<br>
think.
