<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot;J. R. Molloy&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jr@shasta.com?Subject=RE:%20Paying%20for%20Schools%20(was:%20SOCIETY:%20Re:%20The%20privatization%20of%20public%20security)&In-Reply-To=&lt;F243uvbUCwBp9evGMVJ0000142e@hotmail.com&gt;">jr@shasta.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;I think deadbeats who bring children into the world without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the means to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;adequately support them should be punished for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unconscionable abuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;negligence, and the children should be placed with more responsible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;parents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A few questions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What of the inalienable right to procreate?  Should that be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; limited only to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the fiscally fit?  Should that right be denied to the poor?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If so, why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't we just sterilize everyone living in poverty until they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can prove that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are financially responsible enough to have the procedure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reversed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sound a little Orwellian?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do you think children would be better off in foster care than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; loving parents, simply because the parents are poor?  Have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you ever known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anyone raised in the foster care system?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; -Zero
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Straw man here as I see it. Just because someone SHOULDNT havent children
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesnt mean they dont have a right to have them. I personally think you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shouldnt drink alchol, but you certainly have the right.
</em><br>
<p>Definitely a straw man argument.  But I didn't set it up.  I merely pointed 
<br>
out what a defenseless argument it is.  (For those having difficulty 
<br>
following: the &quot;straw man&quot; is the argument that people who have kids without 
<br>
the resources sans subsidization to support them should have their kids 
<br>
taken away.)
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
