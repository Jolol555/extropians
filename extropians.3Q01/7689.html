<p>See, I think some variation of this is a good idea; treat the Taliban

like the Berlin Wall. But it's bound to heat the war up A Lot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Maybe not de jure, but de facto might work. Something like 'if you're

<p>This is indeed a problem, especially if their families were left behind
<br>
(as they would be).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Perhaps if we staked out a limited territory we were capable of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;zone open to anybody who managed to escape from Towelban-controlled

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and do everything possible to inspire a culture of democracy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;individual liberty, and secularism in that area.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is conceivable, though I have no idea how to do it without
<br>
&quot;pacifying&quot; a region with (essentially) permanent military occupation.
<br>
This &quot;war&quot; will never be over; it will be much worse than digging out the
<br>
occasional Japanese Army vet in 1970. But we can get a few more nines
<br>
into the odds of having a peaceful day, over time (0.999--&gt;0.99999, etc.).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;

</em><br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; but at least thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;along the lines of meme-war and economic/cultural subversion rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;than the bone-headed Vietnam tactics that appear to be holding sway in
</em><br>

<p>There is hope for the Extro list, rough-hew it how they will.

<p>PS: BTW, I think &quot;The Towelban&quot; is a stupid term, in poor taste.
<br>
Rock on, Alex. :)
