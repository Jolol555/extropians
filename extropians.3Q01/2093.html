</em><br>
<em>&gt;I only saw a little bit of the Genoan riots on the news recently but it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strikes me that people don't need a reason to protest, especially violently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I live in Bradford, England and as anyone in England knows, Bradford has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just suffered under some rather nasty race related riots. Essentially the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;BNP (British national party - a group of racist idiots) planned a march on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the same day as an anti racist march through Bradford. On the day, no-one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the BNP turned up (the home secretary banned them) but over 1000 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;asian youths (Pakistani and Indian) came out and had themselves a good old 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;riot. The police tried to break it up but were overwhealmed by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;superior numbers of the rioters. Only clever tactical skills by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;commander of the cops allowed them to clear the streets but by that time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the riots had raged for hours and had caused a great deal of damage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The interesting point is that most of the youths that rioted claimed that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they were defending themselves from the BNP troublemakers and that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;police had attacked the rioters first and with great brutality. Exactly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how the rioters were defending themselves from racist thugs that were over 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;200 miles away (tucked up safe and sound in bed, in London) escapes me.
</em><br>
<p>Damn right.  I firmly believe that the AG movement is, at very least, 
<br>
providing an outlet for the same types who created the whole soccer 
<br>
hooliganism movement in Europe, if not actively nurturing it.  In fact, as 
<br>
I'm sure you're aware, groups such as the BNP and the infamous Combat 18 
<br>
and their continental counterparts are heavily involved in much of the 
<br>
violence at soccer events, and they'll gladly latch on to the AG movement 
<br>
as another way they can get to crack skulls.  And imangine, maybe been seen 
<br>
as heroes to boot!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My point is (sorry it took so long getting there) that there seems to be a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;group present in western society that consists of young men (in their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;teens to their mid twenties) that live to cause trouble, they thrive on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;violence and hatred and really do not care who is on the recieving end of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it. For instance, the greater part of damage done in Bradford was to asian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;businesses by asian rioters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How can we create a brighter future for mankind in general when such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people exist? How can we channel their rage into something constructive? A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lot of discussion on the list is to do with technology solving problems of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the flesh (death, disease, limited intelligence/physical skills). Can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyone think of ways in which such technology could be turned upon the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;violent sections of society to change violence into something constructive.
</em><br>
<p>Part of the problem is with regards to racism and such is that &quot;they didn't 
<br>
lick it off a stone&quot;, as we say here.  Many of them learned this hatred on 
<br>
Daddy's knee.  He told them they were &quot;real Brits&quot;, that they were better 
<br>
than everyone else, and they owned this place.  The change I think must 
<br>
begin here, but I'd have to say it'll probably be a case of it having to 
<br>
die out with the generations.  Someone else here made the point that these 
<br>
are good people operating from a warped model of how the society 
<br>
works.  I'd say this applies in some measure to both &quot;The Firms&quot; and the 
<br>
AGers, although I'd be unlikely to consider them &quot;good&quot; people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I can only see technology helping here through education. I am doing a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years work placement at a school/public computer centre and the reaction 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of some of the kids to the high tech look of the centre makes teaching 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them a lot easier, but there are still those trouble makers who refuse to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behave. Unfortunately I saw more than one of the troublemakers from the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;school I'm working at on the TV, in the midst of the riots, throwing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bricks at cops.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On a side note, about the riots in Genoa. If you are rioting (and to my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mind, you shouldn't be) and you attack an officer of the law, who is armed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and who is charged with dispersing the rioters (i.e. you) and he then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shoots you, then you really deserve everything you get. Stupidity does not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;further the human race one bit and maybe your death will serve as an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example to protest peacefully and not to attack men with guns, with a fire 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extinguisher.
</em><br>

<em>&gt;- ------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Last night as I lay in bed looking at the stars I thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'Where the hell is the ceiling?'&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Ultimately, the cop staring out from behind a riot shield is a human 
<br>
being.  He is likely to open fire when he feels justified, when he is under 
<br>
intense stress, or when he's about to get his brains clubbed out.  Most 
<br>
people in that situation will defend themselves with whatever they 
<br>
have.  The rioters should really know better than to aggressively confront 
<br>
_anyone_ with a firearm.  It really is a bad move in ANY situation, and a 
<br>
utterly stupid one in the high stress environment of a riot.  I'm not 
<br>
saying they deserve it, I'm saying that sooner or later (probably sooner) 
<br>
the right conditions will arise for a tragedy.
<br>
<p>These people, whether rioting about race of globalization, don't seem to be 
<br>
able to see beyond the haze of their own rage.
<br>
<p><p>James...
<br>
<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
