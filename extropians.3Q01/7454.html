<em>&gt; &gt; Last night, an unmistakable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; line was drawn between things that are good and right and things that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evil.  Although it was done in a distinctly American way in a distinctly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; American voice, the call went out to the world to make a clear-cut choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wish I could agree, but it seems to me that in many ways the U.S. is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing its commitment to immoral actions in foreign policy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The most obvious is the proposal to remove 1970's era restrictions on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CIA which prevent them from using criminals as operatives. 
</em><br>
<p>This is untrue. The CIA has only had such restrictions since 1995 under
<br>
a Clinton administration 'holier and stupider than thou' policy ruling
<br>
in response to revelations about CIA paid informers (who were also
<br>
members of their own country's anti-terror and anti-guerrilla forces) in
<br>
central american nations who did not behave like Good American
<br>
Mirandizing and Be Polite To The Criminals law enforcement officials,
<br>
particularly in the area of how they dealt with Americans who were
<br>
aiding and abetting leftist guerrillas (wittingly or unwittingly).
<br>
Since '95, any informant, spy, turncoat, etc who might have an other
<br>
than sterling criminal record has been routinely rejected by the pencil
<br>
pushers in DC and Langley. As a result, human intelligence has wasted
<br>
away to near nothing. Almost everything we get in that area is
<br>
information shared with us by intelligence services of other countries.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; VP Cheney
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and several others have said that we can no longer afford the luxury
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of working only with people who are honest and peacable.  In order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infiltrate thugs and murderers, we are going to hire thugs and murderers.
</em><br>
<p>Obviously the old maxim &quot;set a thief to catch a thief&quot; is falling on
<br>
deaf ears here. People who know the information we need are not going to
<br>
be in the positions necessary to get such information if they are girl
<br>
scouts and choir boys. If that worked, the Pope would be our best intel
<br>
source....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those 1970s limitations were put into place after decades of abusive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior by the CIA.  US sponsored thugs commited terrible acts which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue to hurt the American image overseas.  We are opening the door to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; returning to that pattern of behavior.  It is very questionable whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this will advance the long-term interests of the US.
</em><br>
<p>The only limitations imposed in the 1970's were the presidental
<br>
directive against assassinating rulers of foreign nations (neither bin
<br>
Laden or the Taliban is such), and a prohibition against the CIA spying
<br>
within US borders.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another moral issue is our continued support for repressive governments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.  President Bush singled out those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; three countries in his speech last night, I believe.  These are our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;friends&quot; among the Arabs.  But they are among the most authoritarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regimes in the region.
</em><br>
<p>Jordan is hardly that. Egypt and Saudi? Yes, they are authoritarian.
<br>
Jordan has had a major problem with terrorist groups for almost as long
<br>
as Israel, by people who are not native to their country, groups that
<br>
are supported by Iran, Syria, etc.
<br>
<p>A major problem with democracy in the muslim world is that in any event
<br>
that muslims have free elections, they always seem to vote for radical
<br>
fundamentalists who agree only on one thing: Death to America. It has
<br>
taken Iran more than 20 years to reach a point in its political
<br>
development where it is even minimally behaving in a manner that would
<br>
lend it to resuming relations with civilized nations on a normal basis
<br>
of free trade, travel, and communication, and even that is tenuous, with
<br>
the Ayatollahs retaining the ability to oust any government they feel is
<br>
leaning too far toward the west.
<br>
<p>We don't have 20+ years to withstand more and more terrorism if suddenly
<br>
the muslim world went democratic overnight. We should have to stand for
<br>
it, and we wont.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Likewise we are backing away from criticism of Russia over its actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Chechnya, we are supporting the Pakistani strongman who currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; runs the country, and we are undoubtedly going to mute our criticism of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chinese human rights violations as we look for support from the East.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All of these are countries where the US previously took a strong moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stance of disapproval.  But in a war we can't afford to antagonize those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whom we hope to keep as allies.
</em><br>
<p>One thing they are making clear is that they don't need to maintain ONE
<br>
coalition. They say 'coalitions' because they clearly expect countries
<br>
to pull out once bin Laden is dealt with and we focus on groups that
<br>
they support.
<br>
<p>With Chechnya, the only thing I fear is that enough idiots will follow
<br>
the likes of bin Laden against us that such devastation may be necessary
<br>
elsewhere to ensure a peaceful future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short it looks to me like the pressures of war are forcing us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take a number of moral shortcuts.  The point of morality, I believe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to provide a set of heuristics that will tend to advance long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests over short-term expediencies.  We seem to be moving in exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the opposite direction as we gear up for the coming fight.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, the moral fight being fought is that foreigners have no
<br>
right to use terroristic acts against a government or its people. Bush
<br>
has clearly demonstrated a delineation between national and
<br>
international terrorism. He recognises that native insurgency rebel
<br>
groups are too often labeled 'terrorists' by an oppressive government,
<br>
based on how easily many US Democrats in the 90's labeled law abiding
<br>
Americans 'terrorists' because they disagreed with liberal ideas on gun
<br>
control and religious freedom.
