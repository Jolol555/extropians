<p>Okay.  Now I see that I don't disagree with your &quot;The claim that a
<br>
significant fraction would go bankrupt seems to reflect an unusual
<br>
pessimism about the reasonableness of the relevant bankruptcy laws.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Your version is even farther from the truth than theirs. 98 was one
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of its effects on when and where I kayak).
</em><br>
<p>I took their word for it.  I have a notoriously bad recollection for
<br>
this kind of detail, myself.  I'll accept your argument that weather
<br>
wasn't a big part of it (without digging through the data myself.)  That
<br>
just means the other factors have to carry the whole weight.  I think
<br>
that makes the consequences of the political choices even greater, since
<br>
there were fewer disasters to blame. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Our disagreements about what happened are probably minor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I think the effects of spot market pricing instead of pricing via long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were about as foreseeable as the effects of the mistaken retail pricing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and if either of these two mistakes had been avoided the problems would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not have amounted to a crisis.
</em><br>
<p>Okay.  I think the retail price mistake is bigger, but I won't argue
<br>
that it's much bigger.  If long-term contracts had been used, the
<br>
extreme prices would arguably have been cut from a factor of 10 higher
<br>
than normal to only a factor of 3 (let's say).   That would clearly have
<br>
been enough of a difference that the utilities wouldn't have been taken
<br>
to the verge of bankruptcy.  (One teetered over, the other tottered
<br>
back.)  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The retail pricing mistakes may be the most important issue to emphasize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of governments' widespread pattern of making this type of mistake.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But your use of the word &quot;normally&quot;, and the paper's attempt to claim that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was the only, are probably misleading. We have a long history of retail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power prices being pretty insensitive to short-term changes, and many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments have accomplished this without crises (the main problem being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inefficiency). The restriction on long-term contracts appears to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least normal contributor to the crisis.
</em><br>
<p>(presumably, you meant &quot;the paper's attempt to claim that it was the
<br>
only *factor*&quot;.  I'm not sure what you meant by &quot;many governments have
<br>
accomplished this without crises&quot;.  I'll treat it as 'utility markets
<br>
have often gotten through situations about as bad as this before without
<br>
apparent crisis.&quot;)
<br>
<p>Hmmm.  Yes, utility markets have long operated in a way that isolated
<br>
consumers from short-term fluctuations in the wholesale prices of power.
<br>
&nbsp;So, you're right that I meant &quot;normally&quot; in a different sense.  I think
<br>
the difference here was that the restructuring put a cap on prices, so
<br>
that unlike the normal situation in a power market, not only were
<br>
consumers not seeing the hourly or daily fluctuations, but they weren't
<br>
even exposed to the price rise that was occurring on a scale of months. 
<br>
Of course they'd react slower to a price rise that was only evident with
<br>
the monthly bill, but they weren't even getting that, so they didn't
<br>
react at all.  
<br>
<p><p>I still say that the difference made by making consumers price sensitive
<br>
is to add resilience to the system, while the difference you're arguing
<br>
for from long-term contracts is that it holds down prices (in cases like
<br>
this in which there's an unexpected rise.)  Markets work because demand
<br>
and supply interact through prices.  That's how the market manages to
<br>
allocate goods to their highest valued uses.  Prices go up, people use
<br>
less.  Prices don't change, people don't change their usage.  (Unless
<br>
you can convince some of them that it's a crisis.  I think many people
<br>
are reacting to the crisis and the perceived need for solidarity rather
<br>
than to the actual change in prices that has gotten through to us. 
<br>
That's also what California did about water &quot;shortages&quot;.  Rather than
<br>
raising prices, they convinced most people to &quot;work together in this
<br>
time of shortage.&quot;)
