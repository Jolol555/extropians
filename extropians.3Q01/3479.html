<p>
<em>&gt; For these reasons, public opinion turned in favor of the GOP and against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Democrats because of perceptions of ethical behavior and lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sportsmanship. By persisting in claiming they were robbed of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; election, despite extensive recounts using the same election day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standards by independent organizations, the Democrats don't seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realize they lose more credibility, so polarized are they by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propaganda generated perception that the election of Bush will destroy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the country (likely even more than people like myself felt similarly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about an election of Gore).
</em><br>
<p>Wrong.  The Republicans only followed the law and election procedures where
<br>
they wanted to.  They rejected the law that required postmarks on all
<br>
absentee ballots because the military votes did not have postmarks.  They
<br>
counted these votes &quot;to be fair&quot; even though it violated the law.
<br>
<p>They also allowed the Republican party to &quot;correct&quot; 20,000 absentee ballots
<br>
that did not include the required identification numbers on them.  By law,
<br>
these votes should have been excluded.  By law, these votes should not have
<br>
been in possession of Republicans outside the election system.  By law,
<br>
these votes should not have been altered.  But the Republicans did it
<br>
anyway.
<br>
<p>The Republicans also fought &quot;for&quot; recounts in some counties where they
<br>
thought they would improve, like Volusia county, and &quot;against&quot; recounts in
<br>
other counties where they thought they would win.
<br>
<p>The Republicans were not any more sporting or ethical than Democrats.  Both
<br>
parties fought contradictory legal battles in different counties depending
<br>
on which way they wanted the vote to go.  Both parties argued for the
<br>
existing recount and ballot laws in some counties while simultaneously
<br>
arguing against these laws in other counties.
<br>
<p>I am constantly amazed by the perception on both sides that only the other
<br>
side played unfairly.  I see neither side acting superior to the other in
<br>
the Florida elections.
<br>
<p>One side note:  Later studies show that many other states had worse problems
<br>
with uncounted ballots.  It was only Florida's sunshine law and pivotal role
<br>
in the election that put the focus on Florida.  Most state elections are
<br>
just as screwed up, but the media does not have access to the counting
<br>
process in those states, and there was not as much attention given to those
<br>
states.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The spoilsport antics of the rent-a-riot left wing at the inauguration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and since have continued to help Bush by casting the left as too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immature to lead, and too shrilly extremist to represent the people.
</em><br>
<p>This is too funny.  The Republicans did the same thing in Miami when they
<br>
flew in paid participants for their riot.  Both sides do the exact same
<br>
thing, and yet most people only recall the poor behavior on one side.
