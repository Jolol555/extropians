<p>&lt;&lt; Like anyone here cares of late, but the opinion of this Europhile 
<br>
regarding 
<br>
&nbsp;Bush's speech is WORRIED.  It may be a &quot;golden&quot; moment in history, but I 
<br>
&nbsp;doubt it'll be for the better.  His words were much more ominous than 
<br>
&nbsp;reassuring for someone &quot;on the outside&quot; ie. Europe. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>IIt's my experience that most Europeans are vitally interested in persuading 
<br>
the United State's 'powers that be' to do certain things that are beneficial 
<br>
to them, this is a no-brainer, and seems to be built into human nature, and 
<br>
nature itself.
<br>
<p>But after having lived through the Cold War and seeing Europeans in action, I 
<br>
would say that the tenacity to 'hang tough' against what minds of the 18th 
<br>
century, called Tyrannies seems less focused.  Americans have hardly any room 
<br>
to criticize, but we do have a little room, and since our buddies across the 
<br>
pond rarely, cease to rag on us, I will not hold back either. Perhaps its 
<br>
because America was evil and stupid enough to hang on to slavery, in the 19th 
<br>
century, and fought our bloodiest war over it (unwillingly), that we are a 
<br>
bit more idealistic?
<br>
<p>My view of history is that when it was time to force back the nazis, 
<br>
Europeans at the time were reluctant, and willing to placate Adolph. When it 
<br>
was time to hang tough against the commies, the Euro's sought work-arounds 
<br>
there also, looking for financial benefit. Now that the threat of terrorism 
<br>
in general, and Islamists (radical political/religious Islam) has slain 
<br>
Americans by the thousands; despite anger at the perpetrators, the support 
<br>
for America is a kilometer wide, and a millimeter deep. 
<br>
<p>Here also, work-arounds will be found, and the need to keep the &quot;dialogue&quot; 
<br>
open. Which means never to upset the Gulf States and keep the oil flowing, 
<br>
rather then seek out 'ghastly,' alternatives, such as using Heavy Oil 
<br>
extraction (finally), converting natural gas to gasoline, letting ethanol 
<br>
crops play a small part, and coal liquefaction and so forth. 
<br>
<p>But Europeans will never be alone in the 'dialogue' endeavor, not as long as 
<br>
we have the US State department influencing things. Maybe the State 
<br>
Department ought to move to Europe, where it can better serve it's clients? 
<br>
Or perhaps, father east?
