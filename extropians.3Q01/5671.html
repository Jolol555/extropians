From: &quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20Think%20For%20Yourself...%20Or%20Let%20Machines%20Do%20It%20For%20You?&In-Reply-To=&lt;045a01c1347d$e670e800$f35c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">bradbury@aeiveos.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Now, in the future, as scientific literature hopefully becomes freer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *and* as it becomes directly accessible by our brains, then we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to think things out carefully backreferencing to the scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literature as nessary.  And that will be a marvelous day indeed.
</em><br>
<p>Autonomous thinking machines of the kind that can figure things out for
<br>
themselves, and that can do it in  nanoseconds, increasingly outdistance
<br>
humans (who remain mired in marvel). Machines have already demonstrated the
<br>
ability to solve problems that have stymied humans. To think for yourself
<br>
(autonomous thinking) means to solve problems on your own, without resorting
<br>
to the literature, without looking up answers in reference books, without
<br>
using cheat sheets. To reach correct conclusions by responsive reason, rather
<br>
than by reactive recitation, is the mark of intelligence, rather than the mark
<br>
of regurgitation (as in parrots and script kiddies).
<br>
Life seems to have an affinity for intelligence, and it doesn't much care
<br>
whether intelligence is carbon-based, silicon-based, or polymerized substance
<br>
yet-to-be-synthesized. In this regard, thinking for yourself coincides closely
<br>
with thinking extropically. To the extent humans resort to letting machines
<br>
think for them, whether that involves relying on expert computer systems or
<br>
delegating decisions to intelligent robots, machine cognition will continue to
<br>
displace human cognition. That doesn't bother people who truly love life
<br>
(which has an affinity for intelligence), because machine intelligence can
<br>
help humans to be hyper-cognitive.

<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego
