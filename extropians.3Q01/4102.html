&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 43'rd update of my fly longevity experiments. Except where
<br>
indicated 1/2 tsp citric acid was added to all bottles. I decided to
<br>
retest a variety of doses of citric acid, since I was not convinced that
<br>
dosage really matter at &gt;1/4 tsp. The present results confirm dosage is
<br>
unimportant, and that variations in longevity are due to chance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also tested a variety of teas. The most bitter of these was yin hong
<br>
tea, and it as well as eucommia appear to be the only ones that were
<br>
significantly toxic.

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the third update on my food satiation experiments, in which I
<br>
compare my ad libitum calorie intake of various foods over a period of
<br>
one day.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried drinking Lucerne 2% chocolate milk to see how this compared
<br>
with Astro's sugar free no fat fruit yogurts. The chocolate milk tasted
<br>
good, but the lack of variety placed this in the middle palatability
<br>
group. Despite this reduction in liking, I glugged 2100 calories of choco
<br>
milk. On a per liter basis the sugar sweetened chocolate milk came with
<br>
700 calories, which is 65% higher than the caloric density (424
<br>
cals/liter) of the sugar free no fat yogurt. I strongly suspect that this
<br>
increased density accounted for the 42% higher calorie intake. It amazes
<br>
me how many calories sugar can add to foods. For example I found that
<br>
sweetened apple sauce contains double the calories of unsweetened apple
<br>
sauce.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I next tried Astro's 1% fat sugar sweetened yogurt. I found this to be
<br>
less sweet than the no fat yogurt, and also it has less fruit, but more
<br>
calories (936 cals/liter). Again despite the lower palatability I ate 2354
<br>
calories of this yogurt! Sugar calories are evidentally quite dangerous to
<br>
my waistline. Caloric density of liquid palatable foods has a dramatic
<br>
effect on my ad libitum intake. This is in marked contrast the complete
<br>
irrelevance of density to intake of low palatability foods. Indeed I can
<br>
not convince myself that any food characteristic has a consistent effect
<br>
on intake of low palatability foods. Without the lure of taste, my only
<br>
motivation to eat appears to be to ingest the minimum calories my body
<br>
needs to survive, which seems to be about 1500 calories/day.
