</em><br>
<p>Actually, I would say far more separates us from Plato. We are not claiming
<br>
the telos just for humanity's best (although I guess we all from time to
<br>
time see ourselves as the select philosophers of the future; just a bit of
<br>
self-serving pride) but for all of humanity.  As Carl Feynman put it:
<br>
Godlike powers can be mass-produced and inexpensive. Also, this telos is
<br>
not seen as some single Platonic ideal, but rather ethically at least
<br>
(after all, we have plenty of convergentists here who think future
<br>
development will converge on some state or another) we can select many
<br>
different possible directions. The telos is towards greater self
<br>
actualisation, but that might be something more akin to the plurality of
<br>
Aristotelian virtues rather than a single ideal. 
<br>
<p>I think Plato would be horrified by the idea of transhumanism - we are
<br>
seeking to become something different from human, and we gladly accept
<br>
change. In Plato's view (which in this respect seem amusingly similar to
<br>
Jeremy Rifkin's in _Entropy_) change is a bad thing, due to our remoteness
<br>
from the Ideal. The only acceptable change is towards an ideal state, and
<br>
then it would stop.
