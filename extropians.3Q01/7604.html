<p>PEER-TO-PEER TERRORISM
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad news from the Napster wars:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the harder you fight against
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decentralized networks, the more
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enemies you create.

<br>
<p><p><p>Sept. 26, 2001
<br>
<p>Their hatred is implacable, their forces are decentralized. They seek 
<br>
the protection of remote hosts for their secret bases. Their networks 
<br>
are weblike and personal, difficult for outside observers to 
<br>
penetrate. They use e-mail, encryption and other new technologies to 
<br>
hide their dark doings.
<br>
<p>Pay close enough attention to the descriptions of America's newest 
<br>
enemies coming from Washington's talking heads, and something starts 
<br>
to seem oddly familiar. Haven't we heard about these people before? 
<br>
Wasn't it just a few months ago that we were being warned about their 
<br>
dire plans and the civil liberties compromises required to fight 
<br>
them? But no. That wasn't about Osama bin Laden at all. That was 
<br>
about ... about ... Napster?
<br>
<p>Strange but true: The rules of engagement in &quot;America's New War&quot; have 
<br>
a great deal in common with the content wars of the last few years. 
<br>
The RIAA and the MPAA -- the FBI and the CIA of the entertainment 
<br>
industries -- have been involved in extended legal battles with the 
<br>
music traders and software hackers of the world, and the strategies 
<br>
they have employed show some striking parallels to recent American 
<br>
anti-terrorist strategic thought. Consider:
<br>
<p>*   All security is insecure.
<br>
<p>The DeCSS debacle began when a 17-year-old amateur cracked the 
<br>
encryption scheme on DVDs. If there's an unpenetrated Web server or 
<br>
uncracked content-protection scheme out there, it's only because no 
<br>
one truly dedicated has tried to break it. As long as the media 
<br>
industries rely on technology-only solutions to protect their 
<br>
content, that protection is purely nominal, falling quickly before 
<br>
the determined hacker.
<br>
<p>The harsh lessons of computer security are worth keeping in mind when 
<br>
thinking about terrorism. Systems are large and complex beasts and 
<br>
therefore vulnerable; the United States and its people are perhaps 
<br>
the largest and most complicated system in the world. An attacker has 
<br>
free choice of attacks: The hijackers last week were able to ignore 
<br>
the tight physical security around the World Trade Center by choosing 
<br>
an airplane-based attack instead. Security is what you use to spot 
<br>
your attackers and slow them down long enough for you to respond. Far 
<br>
better to seek out your opponents than to wait for them to come to 
<br>
you.
<br>
<p>*   The front line of the conflict is human intelligence.
<br>
<p>Shutting down any loose network -- whether it's a cluster of 
<br>
terrorist cells or a peer-to-peer file-sharing system -- depends on 
<br>
closing the knowledge gap between initiates and outsiders. The mere 
<br>
existence of a strong program of infiltration has an enormous 
<br>
deterrent effect: How can you recruit new members with confidence if 
<br>
every potential recruit might be a plant?
<br>
<p>There's no way to just search the Internet for everyone running 
<br>
personal Web servers to share out their MP3s, but with enough 
<br>
dedicated surfers, the media companies have been able to spot most 
<br>
sites big enough to worry about. The result is that people are forced 
<br>
underground: They trade music in smaller networks than in Napster's 
<br>
day, sacrificing convenience for safer obscurity.
<br>
<p>Something similar operates in the realm of anti-terrorist 
<br>
intelligence. There's no setting on spy satellites or metal detectors 
<br>
to scan for &quot;terrorist,&quot; but enough skilled agents who fit in can 
<br>
track down any terrorist cell that interacts with the outside world. 
<br>
The MPAA had an easier time of it than the CIA will -- it's a lot 
<br>
easier to hire for Internet credibility than it is to hire for 
<br>
radical terrorist credibility -- but it's the credibility, rather 
<br>
than the technology, that opens doors and lets the light of law 
<br>
enforcement in.
<br>
<p>*   If you can't shut down your enemy, shut down his hosts.
<br>
<p>When the MPAA tried to suppress the distribution of DeCSS, it quickly 
<br>
discovered that many of the individual users posting the code to the 
<br>
Web were prohibitively difficult to identify, ruling out direct legal 
<br>
action against them. The MPAA instead targeted their ISPs: legally, 
<br>
the Web hosting companies were obligated to take down DeCSS pages, 
<br>
unless the users were willing to stand up in court and be sued. 
<br>
Through this sidestep, the MPAA was able to sic its lawyers on the 
<br>
people it really wanted to sue, or failing that, make the problem go 
<br>
away.
<br>
<p>In declaring that the U.S. government would not distinguish between 
<br>
terrorists and regimes that harbor terrorists, President Bush acted 
<br>
on the same principle. Like the ISPs, the Taliban would prefer to be 
<br>
a bystander in any conflict. By making them liable for the safe 
<br>
harbors they grant, though, Bush transferred some of the weight of 
<br>
U.S. pressure to a more identifiable target -- in order to acquire 
<br>
greater leverage against his real enemies.
<br>
<p>So far, so good. But though Washington has been quick to copy from 
<br>
Hollywood's playbook, it also seems reluctant to learn from the ways 
<br>
in which those plays have failed.
<br>
<p>*   Zealous enforcement tactics against old enemies breed new enemies.
<br>
<p>Before Napster, few people had strong opinions about the record 
<br>
companies, and their voices were rarely heard. But in the process of 
<br>
hunting down a few college students whose main offense was liking 
<br>
music too much, the RIAA managed to antagonize much of the software 
<br>
community and civil libertarians everywhere.
<br>
<p><p>How did they blow it so badly? By giving its old enemies powerful new 
<br>
arguments, tons of publicity and an impressionable audience to preach 
<br>
to. Those students and music fans started hearing about cartels and 
<br>
Gestapo tactics when they asked why their Napster wasn't showing any 
<br>
songs today.
<br>
<p>It's hardly any surprise the RIAA didn't understand how bad the P.R. 
<br>
consequences of a heavy hand would be: The U.S. as a country has a 
<br>
long and bloody history of isolating moderates while it chases 
<br>
extremists.
<br>
<p>What will happen if the government of Pakistan is forced to do so 
<br>
much of our dirty work that it destabilizes itself? How much ill will 
<br>
will we harvest once the bombs start falling? And so on. Bold action 
<br>
may sometimes solve present problems, but it carries enormous risk of 
<br>
creating worse ones in the future. More worryingly ...
<br>
<p>*   You can make them hide, but you can't rid the world of them.
<br>
<p>Or at least, if you can, the RIAA hasn't figured out how. Napster 
<br>
went down in flames, but the Napster clones are numerous, thriving, 
<br>
better-hidden and harder than ever to take out.
<br>
<p>Flattening your visible enemies inspires your remaining enemies to 
<br>
stay invisible; unless you make them no longer your enemies, they 
<br>
will find a time and a place of their own choosing to emerge from 
<br>
hiding. The best &quot;victory&quot; one can hope for in fighting a 
<br>
decentralized foe is not to eradicate them, but only to suppress 
<br>
their activities.
<br>
<p>Try explaining this fact in Washington today, though, and nobody 
<br>
seems to be listening. Has Israel been able to eradicate Hamas? Has 
<br>
Britain been able even to suppress the IRA? For that matter, how well 
<br>
has China done in eliminating Falun Gong? Which raises one last and 
<br>
especially disturbing point, one that ought to go without saying ...
<br>
<p>*   Terrorists are not the only people who operate in decentralized secrecy.
<br>
<p>There are other peer-to-peer rebels out there, working in secret to 
<br>
change the world -- and most of them are what we would normally think 
<br>
of as the good guys.
<br>
<p>Think of Afghan dissidents spreading the rhetoric of democracy from 
<br>
Internet cafes. From the perspective of the Afghan government, they 
<br>
look much the same way terrorists who coordinate attacks through 
<br>
e-mail look to us. Think of demonstrators scattering to avoid 
<br>
punitive raids from the police; think of rebel leaders trying to 
<br>
organize a resistance movement. A lot of people will be watching very 
<br>
carefully what the United States does to wage this new sort of war.
<br>
<p>On the one hand every new tactic we develop to defend democracy can 
<br>
be turned against the forces of democracy somewhere else in the 
<br>
world. And on the other, every bulwark the Internet provides against 
<br>
the anti-dissent squads somewhere far off and repressive, it provides 
<br>
also against the anti-terrorist branch of the FBI back home.
<br>
<p>Technology giveth, and it taketh away. The same filtering software 
<br>
that protects children from pornography is used by repressive 
<br>
governments to &quot;protect&quot; their citizens from critical opinions. The 
<br>
new formats for compressing music designed to sell more CDs instead 
<br>
became the leading techniques for its illicit distribution.
<br>
<p>As we prepare to develop ruthless new &quot;weapons&quot; in the fight against 
<br>
global terrorism, it is hard to overstate the need for some 
<br>
reflection on the ways those tactics might eventually be turned 
<br>
against us and those principles we believe in. A strange prospect, 
<br>
perhaps, but then again, until last week, how many people seriously 
<br>
thought of a passenger jet as a weapon of war?
