</em><br>
<p>Has anybody read or considered the effects of a fast onset ice age
<br>
precipitated by destruction of the haline cycle and the natural effect
<br>
of ocean thermoclines?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From recent research I've read, the ultimate catastrophe of global
</em><br>
warming won't be run away heating, but the triggering of massive
<br>
polar melting, sending tremendous amounts of fresh water into the
<br>
oceans at the poles, immediately killing the haline cycle, the engine
<br>
most responsible for circulating equatorial heat to the poles... the
<br>
water at the equator get's hotter and the poles freeze hard driving
<br>
ice sheets way down into temperate regions. The planet's albedo
<br>
changes, both by the increase in cloud cover from storms driven by
<br>
heated equatorial waters, and from ice from midtemperate regions
<br>
to the poles... it's one thing to pigment ice at the poles, what kind
<br>
of project would it be to cover 40% of the planet's surface with a
<br>
dark pigment for absorbing solar heat... that's a pretty tall order.
<br>
And all that would do is further heat the equatorial regions... doing
<br>
even more damage to the other 60% of the world's surface.
<br>
<p>I think this is something people need to begin to face, about wildly
<br>
complex dynamic systems with virtually unlimited feedback... there
<br>
are no simple answers... you patch it here, it leaks out there... you
<br>
heat it here, and it boils there and freezes someplace else... I'm not
<br>
even saying that we're responsible for any of this, I am saying we
<br>
should look at screwing with the engine very carefully, and I would
<br>
not touch squat until I had petaflop computers modeling the planet
<br>
down to the sub kilometer resolution... I want to know with a high
<br>
level of certainty that if I'm painting this ice field black, that I won't
<br>
be the one responsible for the 7 class 5 hurricanes that subsequently
<br>
barrel down on gulf states... I would be very concerned about simple
<br>
solutions to complex systems... it almost never works that  way.
<br>
<p>Switching conversations... getting back to the MOVIE
<br>
<p>It's one more reason I liked the movie, they bothered to include,
<br>
a gobal warming scenario followed by a sudden mini ice age...
<br>
Somebody went to a whole lot of trouble to read up on the
<br>
possible results of these circumstances. On many levels, these
<br>
guys were terribly thoughful.
<br>
<p>And I won't argue that you could drive a semi through some of the
<br>
logical holes and artificial plot devices... but the first purpose of the
<br>
film was to entertain... on this it succeeded. I believe it get's people
<br>
with it's vison... if god forbid it even stirs the great mouth breathing
<br>
public to even think, then by all means, it deserves to be applauded.
