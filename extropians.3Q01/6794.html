<p>Wrong.  It will be a war to end the threat of such terrorism,
<br>
not for simply vengeance.  It does not even require any
<br>
particular hatred.  Just a firm determination to wipeout the
<br>
threat.
<br>
<p>That may or may not be doable but I am pretty tired it is only
<br>
about &quot;vengeance&quot; and that we would be fueled by the same sort
<br>
of hate and all the rest of the shallow bs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or, the US can go find the guilty parties now, and bring them to justice, by

</em><br>
<p>There is no international justice sufficient to the task and it
<br>
is doubtful that you could get the real powers behind these
<br>
events and all those capable of and desirious of similar and
<br>
worse atrocities in a peaceable, non-military manner.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; But there is still bloodlust to satisfy, and a question of jingoism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answerable only in the basest terms. There is nothing I can say to modify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any of that.
</em><br>
<p>I am tired of the accusation, as I've set.  Do a bit deeper
<br>
analysis and you will see that the threat of the next level or
<br>
two of escalated terrorism would destroy a lot of freedom  and
<br>
slow down everything a lot, perhaps catastrophically so.  That
<br>
is a huge sword hanging over the heads of us all.  We do need to
<br>
do something to deal with this threat.  That goes far beyond
<br>
simply bloodlust.
