<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have the president's ear.  What would you say?
</em><br>
<p>Preach conversion to electric transport, for starters.  Less moving
<br>
parts means less oil for lubrication, and motive power itself comes
<br>
from something other than gasoline.  Not to mention all kinds of
<br>
eco-benefits, redeemable for better chances of re-election.  Also
<br>
increased electric demand, therefore more money to (and donations from)
<br>
the power companies - though, to keep consistent with the goal,
<br>
increase subsidization of non-fossil-fuel plants.
<br>
<p>Increase government subsidies - direct to the consumers, maybe but not
<br>
necessarily also through the companies - to reduce consumer cost of
<br>
electric cars to less than gasoline-fuelled ones.  Shop around
<br>
government and corporate labs for some high-tech power storage units
<br>
that can overcome range limitations on electric cars, and make the
<br>
technology available for cheap to any car company (American or
<br>
otherwise: helping wean our allies from fossil fuels too can't hurt)
<br>
that wants to use 'em.  Likewise, heavily encourage municipalities to
<br>
switch their buses towards electric.  Perhaps even try to build them
<br>
up to milspec (like the Navy is already doing), so our forces abroad
<br>
won't be out of sorts if and when the oil runs dry...though this would
<br>
probably be most troublesome for the Air Force, even if all-electric
<br>
supersonic jet engines were developed.  (Not that they'd mind the
<br>
stealth benefits: &quot;*What* heated exhaust?  We're just a ripple in the
<br>
air.&quot;)
<br>
<p>Kick back to the aerospace industry by funding development of
<br>
airliner-quality sub-orbital ballistic transport using rocket fuels
<br>
that can be manufactured in America, with contract condition that some
<br>
large percent of the development money gets paid when, not before, the
<br>
transports go into operation by the end of 2004.  Disqualify from
<br>
competition any firm (either direct, or any level of subcontractor on
<br>
the development) that has tried, and failed, to see through a similar
<br>
project in the past several years: this excludes companies like Boeing
<br>
and Lockheed, who would have an arguable financial interest in seeing
<br>
this fail.  (Possibly kick in the remaining $5 mil to fund the X Prize
<br>
without adding any strings to it, if that's not too libertarian...and
<br>
not too impossible for government funding.  ^_^)
<br>
<p>Check around to see if synthetic fossil fuels can be pushed towards
<br>
price competitiveness with the natural equivalent.  Maybe toss some
<br>
funds into researching that, especially for medical uses and plastics
<br>
manufacture.
