<em>&gt; THEY correct for what THEY, in their biased opinions, is the correct

</em><br>
<p>Not exactly.  I am objective enough to recognize that ALL people have
<br>
biases. ALL research is biased.  This is the basis of the scientific method.
<br>
We must try to contrive double-blind studies to keep the researcher from
<br>
influencing the results.  We must publish our methods so that others can
<br>
critique and see if we skewed the results.  I am not saying that the liberal
<br>
media is not guilty of this bias.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Its like asking police to accurately measure how much police brutality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is, or the Chinese how much human rights violations there is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; China. You are guaranteed to get bad results.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that self-reporting never works.  I think you are stretching the
<br>
point to claim that the liberal media and the liberal presidential candidate
<br>
are the same group, and therefore we can't trust the news media to report
<br>
the election results.  This would be like saying that the Bush campaign
<br>
leader in Florida was the same as the supervisor of elections in Florida and
<br>
therefore we can't trust her vote tallies.  There may be bias, but there are
<br>
enough double-checks and independent observers to keep all sides well
<br>
informed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Did I say 'conspiracy'? No, I did not, so I think that it is you who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assuming things here. I think that it is perfectly normal for people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) are vested in their own opinions to a high degree (as political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activists generally are), b) think people like themselves are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honest, friendly, and trustworthy, and c) dislike people they disagree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with, will tend to conciously or subconciously behave at an exit poll in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a way which is biased in favor of their own side.
</em><br>
<p>This does not seem to match your next paragraph.  Above, you seem to concede
<br>
natural bias and unintended data skewing.  Below you state that Democrats or
<br>
more likely to deliberately fake poll results than Republicans.  I may have
<br>
assumed too much when I used the word &quot;conspiracy&quot; to describe your view
<br>
below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also am of the opinion that Democrats generally feel more strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they and their allies are more 'hard done by', that their opponents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'owe them something' for past sins (as per the reparations and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues), and thus, as individuals, are more amenable to subtly skewing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the results they collect by cherry picking poll subjects.
</em><br>
<p>In any event, we seem to agree on proper polling procedures and problems.
<br>
We differ only in the intent and severity of the problems.  I think we both
<br>
would like to see newscaster not call elections before voting is completed.
<br>
<p>(On a different topic, how do we enforce this without more government
<br>
regulations?  In a totally free and libertarian society, wouldn't anybody be
<br>
free to poll and publish polling whenever they wanted?  Isn't this
<br>
wide-spread freedom in this area what we have now.  I'm not sure my desire
<br>
to suppress polling data during an election can be reconciled with
<br>
libertarianism.  Damn, no wonder I'm only &quot;medium-core&quot;!)
