<p>For those who would argue immoderation, one has to recognize _why_
<br>
&quot;war&quot; has been declared on us.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Now, the article claims that bin Laden may have obtained up to 20
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear warheads that are being turned into suitcase bombs.  If that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the case then it is *very, very* serious.  What is needed is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater investigation as to the reality that the Chechnyans may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been able to obtain these resources.  It seems somewhat implausible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because one has to ask why wouldn't they have used them against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russian's themselves?  (A lack of technological sophistication is one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility.)
</em><br>
<p>Regardless of whether Bin Laden or similar has nukes now, the
<br>
situation is extremely serious.  The US is gearing up to create
<br>
thousands more terrorists and tens of millions (at least) more
<br>
sympathizers, and possibly destabilizing secular governments
<br>
throughout the Muslim world, which Islamists would absolutely love.
<br>
And they _will_ have WMD sooner or later.  How'd you like to live
<br>
in a world with a dozen Taliban-style states and accompanying
<br>
terrorist camps and attacks?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does anyone see any flaws with this type of approach?
</em><br>
<p>What's the range and lifespan of these self-flying spies?  I doubt
<br>
that we could make an uncooperative society nearly transparent on
<br>
a personal level with current technology.  Even if we could, it
<br>
appears that terrorists cells don't rely on much open activity.
<br>
I suspect they'd operate well even from real prisons, let alone
<br>
virtual prisons of transparency.
<br>
<p>BTW, I recall someone wondering in the past few months whether Ian
<br>
Goddard had fallen off the face of the earth.  Nope, in
<br>
<a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig2/goddard1.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig2/goddard1.html</a> he asks &quot;Was United
<br>
Airlines Flight 93 Shot Down By U.S. Fighter?&quot;  Guess he just fell
<br>
into a pigeonhole.
