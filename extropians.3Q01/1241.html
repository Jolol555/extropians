</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your distinction eludes me, was Hiroshima tactical or strategic? I ask you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider the W-88 warhead, it's a bit too big to be called a backpack nuke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not by much. The Hiroshima bomb was a cylinder 10 and a half feet long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it weighed 8,900 pounds, it  produced about 12 kilotons. The modern W-88
</em><br>
<em>&gt; H bomb is still a cylinder but it's only 2 and a half feet long and weighs just under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 300 pounds, yet it produces 150 kilotons, more than 10 times as powerful as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Hiroshima bomb. UPS sends lots of 300 pound packages every day.
</em><br>
<p>And all imported packages do go through sniffing protocols when they
<br>
come into the country. Don't be silly.
<br>
<p>Now, a true pony nuke is about 80 lb, and has a yeild of abour 8kt. It
<br>
also is sniffed when it comes into the country, and a radiation source
<br>
would glow like a neon sign in an xray machine.
<br>
<p>The Hiroshima bomb killed lots of people in a very tightly packed asian
<br>
community that lived at something like 4-5 times the density level of
<br>
the typical US city, but most people died from the firestorm and the
<br>
lack of medical care after the fact. Use of such a weapon today would
<br>
not cowe anybody. It would piss them off. The only reason the Hiroshima
<br>
bomb was effective at the time was a) Japan was already reeling and on
<br>
its knees from sustained firebombing of its cities and the destruction
<br>
of its military and loss of Okinawa, and b) they did not know how many
<br>
more bombs we had. Considering our propensity for mass production, they
<br>
assumed we had plenty to use, despite the fact we did not.
<br>
<p>Using a Hiroshima bomb today on a US city would not have the same effect
<br>
on the US as it did on Japan at the time. More than likely, it would
<br>
cause the US to get even more nationalist than it did over the Pearl
<br>
Harbor attack, and in a mood to bomb somebody back to the stone age.
<br>
<p>For the 'Sapper Strategy' you posit to work as a sort of concerted
<br>
attack on the US, they would have to be able to infiltrate hundreds of
<br>
such packages into separate locations in the US. It is highly likely
<br>
that at least one would be detected, which would put the nation on alert
<br>
and every UPS van would have every package ripped open (as well as
<br>
FedEx, etc). This is just not feasible.
<br>
<p>A more probable scenario is the launching of cruise missiles from
<br>
trawlers, which can be intercepted and are detectable from air radars.
