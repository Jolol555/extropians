From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20The%20Importance%20of%20the%20Enteric%20Nervous%20System%20(Was:%20Transhuman%20Values)&In-Reply-To=&lt;016401c13d58$5a9c65a0$825c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Why don't you think these are part of human values?
</em><br>
<p>To conclude from the messages I've sent that I don't think these are _part_ of
<br>
human values is irrational.
<br>
Pure intelligence would not be polluted by religious memes. The idea that &quot;we
<br>
can strive for values even if we are not good at achieving them&quot; is extropic
<br>
to the extent that the &quot;values&quot; involved are transhumanist values rather than
<br>
human values (human values are the kind that motivated the religious fanatics
<br>
who committed the atrocity of September 11, 2001).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making the above values transhuman, you are implying that humans can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever achieve them
</em><br>
<p>No, the implication is that humans should aim at attaining a transhuman
<br>
condition.
<br>
You would rather imply that humans can't ever achieve transhuman status? Then
<br>
why be a transhumanist?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; which is both a very pessimistic statement about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans incompatible with much of the humanist foundations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism, and gives a ready excuse for not pursuing them until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-neurotech is here to fix our brains.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you choose to see it as &quot;very pessimistic&quot; that's your business.
<br>
Actually, it's quite optimistic to think that there is some chance that life
<br>
on Earth will transcend the religious fanaticism that has recently raised its
<br>
ugly head. So don't jump to conclusions about excuses for not pursuing
<br>
transhumanism. I'm simply advocating the use of transhuman values (which means
<br>
displacing religious fanaticism) to arrive at a transhuman future. To help
<br>
things along, you, as a student of super-neurotech (hey, great new field with
<br>
huge potential), can begin devising ways to implement it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally I consider pure intelligence to be a contradiction in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms: intelligence is something practical, that gets its metaphorical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hands dirty in learning and changing the real world. Emotion is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important part of intelligence too, if only as a value selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system.
</em><br>
<p>Personally, I consider intelligence to be the ability to solve problems and
<br>
answer questions. So pure intelligence means simply the ability to solve
<br>
problems and answer questions in the real world, without speculating in
<br>
metaphors. Of course emotion is an important part of intelligence. That's why
<br>
I've emphasized the importance of the enteric nervous system (on this list and
<br>
others), and it may have an important part in making intelligent selections.
<br>
To the degree it entails &quot;value selection&quot; of the merely human kind, it is of
<br>
no use to the furtherance of transhumanism. A reconfigured brain would
<br>
definitely not need to do away with the enteric nervous system and the
<br>
emotions that it engenders. On the contrary, the enteric nervous system is
<br>
necessary to good emotional health. That's why uploading must include the
<br>
enteric nervous system and its accompanying emotions.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values
<br>
<p><p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
