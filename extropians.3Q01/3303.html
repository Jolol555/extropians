<p>In my misspent youth I tried my hand at panhandling, back in the
<br>
days when you did it with a smile and a blessing whether you got
<br>
anything or not.  You were lucky usually to get enough for food
<br>
and a flophouse roof over your head.  So the above is utterly
<br>
false to my experience.  
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; But anyway, back to the point: most of these people have made a sensible,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well.  When I did it I did it because I hadn't figured out how
<br>
to plug myself into an economy and workforce that seemed to me
<br>
insane and I didn't want to put my brains in service of what I
<br>
considered insane (end of the Vietnam era).  After a while I
<br>
stopped when I realized that I was pretending to take a moral
<br>
high road by being dependent on those who for one reason or
<br>
another did not take that road.  That struck me as unfair and
<br>
hypocritical of me.  But I certainly wasn't making more at it
<br>
than I made in even the lowliest jobs.
