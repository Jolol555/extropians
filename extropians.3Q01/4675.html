<em>&gt; &gt;I think the material world is inherently neutral, which in some ways is

<em>&gt; Somebody archive that post.  When SIAI has acheived its goals and Eli is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remembered as the father of our post-technological society, generations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robots will remember his words and weep with gratitude.
</em><br>
<p>You know, that's really not what this is about.  I know it sounds amusing,
<br>
and I know that you're mostly joking, but even so that's not what this is
<br>
about.  Getting a place in the history books isn't a good reason to do
<br>
something.  The real lives that are touched by the Singularity are
<br>
greater, by a factor of six billion, than the one life that might be
<br>
touched by getting a place in the history books.
<br>
<p>Even that doesn't really cover it.  Getting a place in the history books
<br>
is never going to be as much fun as the smallest round of genuine
<br>
intelligence enhancement.  Getting a place in the history books is the
<br>
kind of thing that people have been trying to do since before the
<br>
invention of writing.  The benefits involved in the Singularity are of a
<br>
vastly higher and stronger order then the kind of material and
<br>
psychological benefits involved with having a place in the history books. 
<br>
It's not just whether the desire for fame is right or wrong, but whether
<br>
&quot;fame&quot; and the desire for it is a temporary pre-Singularity facet of human
<br>
psychology that is overwhelmingly outgunned by the kind of forces bound up
<br>
in the Singularity.  What I'm trying to say is that asking whether the
<br>
world will be grateful is not just a case of doing things for the wrong
<br>
reasons; it seems like a failure of future shock.  I would rather have an
<br>
extra ten IQ points then any amount of fame, because intelligence has more
<br>
substance.  Being motivated by the image of cheering crowds cuts against
<br>
the grain of the whole Singularity, and it cuts against the grain of
<br>
rationality; it means that you're being controlled by the thoughts that
<br>
generate a certain kind of pleasantness, instead of making decisions so
<br>
that your actions generate the most good.
<br>
<p>Last but not least, there are already more people to SIAI than just me. 
<br>
Brian and Sabine, Dmitriy and the entire Flare crew, all our donors...  I
<br>
think that people have been associating SIAI too strongly with Eliezer.
