<br>
<p>Good point, Samantha. In order to significantly influence the nature of the
<br>
environment we'll inhabit in ten years' time I'd think we'd want to do the
<br>
following:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, define, to the best of our ability, the effect new technologies will
<br>
have on human behavior. The one thing we're sure of is that there will be
<br>
rapid change, so at the very least we might want to see how people behaved
<br>
during historical periods when drastic changes occurred. Although there has
<br>
never been a singularity such as we face now, there have been a number of
<br>
times when cultural evolution was discontinuous, at least locally. One of
<br>
the most valuable characteristics a person can have in such times is
<br>
flexibility, which would include a wide breadth of knowledge, and the
<br>
ability to think on one's feet and make decisions under conditions of
<br>
uncertainty. During singularities of the past, flexibility has generally
<br>
been far more valuable than a store of material possessions. In fact,
<br>
possessions can work against a person if she uses too much of her energy
<br>
protecting them or fails to make an advantageous move for fear of losing
<br>
them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the most part, schools are not teaching students how to be flexible.
<br>
One danger I see in this is that many of these people won't be able to cope
<br>
with the changes ahead. People who can't cope become frightened and are ripe
<br>
for falling under the spell of unpleasant sorts of leaders.
<br>
<p>I have to leave for a while and don't have time to finish what I was
<br>
planning to write. However, I'll send this bit off and see if anyone's
<br>
interested in pursuing this line of thought.
<br>
