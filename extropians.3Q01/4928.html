Mike Lorrey said:
<br>
<em>&gt; No, they are not free to spend it on social welfare programs. 
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  You have distorted the argument Mike.  What I said the
<br>
program indicated was that the IMF would *not* allow Jamaica
<br>
to loan the money to its farmers at interest rates lower than
<br>
what the IMF was charging.
<br>
<p>I said *nothing* about &quot;social welfare&quot; programs unless you
<br>
consider building hospitals or schools &quot;social welfare&quot;.
<br>
<p>I don't know precisely what the money was spent on, it would
<br>
take a detailed investigation of Jamaican government budgets
<br>
to determine that.  There are certainly many cases where
<br>
the money most likely was spent in building palaces for
<br>
dictators or dachas for the loan administrators.  However
<br>
in Jamaica's case the money may have been spent on
<br>
the police force to keep relative order with large numbers
<br>
of unemployed individuals as a result of the trade policies.
<br>
<p>I simply suggested hospitals or schools as infrastructure
<br>
projects that 3rd world countries might construct in an
<br>
effort to uplift themsevles -- however the use of the funds
<br>
for such projects is problematic if it is going to force
<br>
them to go back to the IMF for larger loans because they
<br>
cannot repay the loans they already have.  If you don't
<br>
use the funds in ways that directly serve to increase
<br>
your ability to repay the loans *during* the term of the
<br>
loan, then it looks to me like you are screwed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A bank would get mighty pissed if I took out an auto loan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and used the money on a vacation to Fiji.
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  American banks are *more* than happy to lend you
<br>
money to take a vacation to Fiji.  They will even send
<br>
you checks to do so that carry a 9.9% interest rate.
<br>
They just assume you will pay it back and penalize you
<br>
if you miss payments.
<br>
<p>Now in the case of IMF &amp; Jamaica, it looks like coming
<br>
in the door, they are assuming it isn't going to get paid
<br>
back *and* try to arrange the loan conditions so that
<br>
you can't become competitive enough in world markets that
<br>
you would have the income (presumably from taxes on the
<br>
banana producers) to repay the loan.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't. I see it as &quot;You're not allowed to use this money on heroin, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; food stamps, but only on buying a car so you can get your ass to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each day.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Mike, that isn't the case here.  If there are no jobs then it
<br>
doesn't matter if you have a car or not.  If you want to make
<br>
the case that Jamaica mis-spent the money on social welfare
<br>
programs GO FIND SOME EVIDENCE FOR IT!
<br>
<p>Thanks to Charlie for filling in some of the pieces by providing
<br>
some &quot;data&quot; on how the situation has changed from his perspective.
<br>
That suggests that &quot;non-free trade&quot;, i.e. of the type where presumably
<br>
the government and the people &quot;accepted&quot; an &quot;arranged&quot; trade situation
<br>
(perhaps because the British felt it appropriate to &quot;repay&quot; some past
<br>
imperialistic policies) is not, at least in this special instance,
<br>
highly objectionable.
<br>
<p>I notice that nobody seemed to comment on my comments about the 
<br>
rather hefty increases in subsidies the U.S. farmers seem to be
<br>
getting now.
<br>
<p>Robert
