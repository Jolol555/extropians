</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this is confusing the issue.
</em><br>
<p>I know, I was joking :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I actually think &quot;religion&quot; in this debate is being used to smear anyone who
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is often the same kind of reasoning as calling extropianism a cult.
<br>
If something is called a religion, then it is often implied to lack
<br>
rational basis and its adherents will stick to their views regardless of
<br>
their actual truth. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, I've actually presented arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and evidence of why a free market works in various cases Mariam English and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others have given us as examples of free market failure.  Instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually answering me on this, Mariam has just piled up more examples.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other words, she can't reply to my specific arguments, so she moves on to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other ones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To me this sounds a lot like when I debate with Creationists.  They will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell me evolution is disproven by some case A.  When I show them that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are wrong about A, they ignore this and bring up case B.  When I show them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they are wrong about B, they ignore this and bring up case C.  And so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on.  I think you get where I'm going.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is an extremely common tactic among people who argue for a certain
<br>
belief, for which they have acquired a set of standard arguments but no
<br>
deeper underlying theory. Of course, when debating an opponent with the
<br>
same lack of theory it is just a question about having sharper and more
<br>
compelling examples and claims. But we are hopefully trying to go beyond
<br>
this.
