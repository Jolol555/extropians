I don't understand why we are even discussing these issues.
<br>
<p>Do we not believe that people are innocent until proven guilty?  Do we not
<br>
believe that murdering innocent people for personal gain is wrong?  Do we
<br>
not believe that personal liberty and private property should be respected?
<br>
Do we not believe that free speech, competition, evolution, diversity, and
<br>
cooperation make the best policy?  Do we not believe that other innocent
<br>
people deserve the same rights or freedoms that we demand?
<br>
<p>These kinds of &quot;calculations&quot; are making big assumptions before the math
<br>
starts.  These assumptions are that we should do whatever furthers our
<br>
cause, period.  Then the calculations try to show that genocide might
<br>
further our cause.  Why stop there?  Wouldn't robbing a bank and using the
<br>
money for good further our cause?  Wouldn't launching a select few into
<br>
space and then destroying the Earth be safer for us?  Wouldn't enslaving all
<br>
of humanity give us more power?  Wouldn't killing all people we don't
<br>
personally know be the utmost selfish act to get all the resources for
<br>
ourselves?  Wouldn't the ultimate calculation score occur for the last human
<br>
left in the universe who inherits everything?
<br>
<p>Since when did taking over everything and destroying others become a
<br>
worthwhile goal?  Instead of using resources to build the best future, these
<br>
calculations seek simply to obtain all the resources.  The scoring system
<br>
itself of this &quot;game&quot; is suspect.  I'm not playing any sort of game by those
<br>
rules, and I am not seeking to win points under this scoring system.  I
<br>
think there are major mistaken assumptions in these calculations.  They seem
<br>
to be fighting for the most freedom for some people over others, instead of
<br>
freedom for all.  We certainly would not agree to these calculations if they
<br>
showed that Western Civilization should be destroyed to gain the maximum
<br>
benefit for the terrorists.
<br>
<p>What is scariest to me is that these are the exact kind of calculations that
<br>
all terrorists use.  When our goals become so important that we are willing
<br>
to sacrifice unsuspecting innocents for our own benefit, we have become the
<br>
enemy.  Anyone who contemplates this logic is contemplating terrorism.
