The following is a message sent yesterday by Robert Ettinger, President
<br>
of the Cryonics Institute, to Cryonet.  I'm posting it here because not
<br>
every Extropian List reader follows Cryonet daily, but some of those who
<br>
don't might be aware of Mr. Swayze's situation and, perhaps, be
<br>
interested in helping.

<p>SAVING JAMES SWAYZE
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Most Cryonet readers are probably familiar with the James Swayze
<br>
situation.  James is almost completely paralyzed, and under federally
<br>
subsidized care. That care has a price.  All his earnings have been taken
<br>
away, and whatever he might somehow manage to earn will also be taken
<br>
away.  His health is precarious, but his determination and his
<br>
&nbsp;intelligence are not.  He learned about cryonics, and the possibility
<br>
that through cryonics he might yet overcome his unfortunate situation. 
<br>
He wants to try.  The only problem is that he can't afford it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
CI, and I personally, would very much like to see Mr. Swayze get his
<br>
chance.  The difficulty is that no cryonics organization can simply
<br>
provide suspensions free of charge.  Suspensions are expensive, and that
<br>
expense is ongoing, as daily care and maintenance and supplies are needed
<br>
to safeguard patients.  Cryonics organizations cannot get into the habit
<br>
of taking financial losses, even for charitable purposes.  We saw that
<br>
happen many years ago with the Chatsworth situation.  There, charity
<br>
patients were accepted.  But with no money to fund their care, or pay
<br>
company bills, the company failed, and those patients and all the
<br>
patients were lost.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
CI has determined that that will never happen to our patients, and so it
<br>
is CI policy that funding, in every case, has to be adequate and certain.
<br>
&nbsp;Nonetheless, I and a number of others at CI have been trying to come up
<br>
with some way to give James his chance.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
My own ideas have gone through several phases.  At one point I thought CI
<br>
might reasonably give James a price break, or even fund his suspension in
<br>
exchange for his active help in public relations.  But as I learned more
<br>
about his situation,  it became clear that this might not be fair either
<br>
to CI or to him.  From our point of view, the potential value of his PR
<br>
help is really uncertain -- it could be considerable, or  it could be
<br>
negligible, and there is a legal question as to whether he can earn
<br>
anything at all without government regulations interfering. From his
<br>
point of view, the demands on his time might be counter-productive.  His
<br>
health varies from bad to very bad, and forcing someone in poor health to
<br>
work for what might be a very long time is neither wise nor  fair.  He
<br>
ought to use his time as he sees fit, perhaps to work on his inventions,
<br>
perhaps just to extract a bit of enjoyment from life.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Rudi Hoffman did a lot of work on life insurance possibilities, providing
<br>
some interesting potential for future problem cases, but leaving gaps in
<br>
James' case, about which I won't go into in detail here.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
So I think now that it just comes down to individuals coming together
<br>
voluntarily to donate the cost of a CI suspension for him.  To make that
<br>
possible, I've made a personal decision. 
<br>
<p>Just under $10,000 has been pledged so far. The total required --
<br>
suspension fee, membership fee, and local and transportation costs -- we
<br>
figure $33,000.  That leaves us $23,000 short, assuming all the previous
<br>
pledgers make good.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I now make the following commitment.  If we can get another $10,000 in
<br>
donations, paid to CI along with payments for the previous pledges (total
<br>
$20,000), then I will personally make up the difference (i.e., fund up to
<br>
$13,000 additional).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I don't want to be misunderstood.  I hope we can get a total donation sum
<br>
of $33,000.  But if we achieve at least $20,000, and we seem to be nearly
<br>
halfway there already, then I will make up the difference.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Now, a few particulars. Every plan can be argued and nitpicked back and
<br>
forth, but I want to avoid argument and get cracking, so the following is
<br>
not just an idea or a suggestion but the plan: 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
1. We want donations, not pledges -- cash, not promises. Please send your
<br>
donations as soon as possible, payable to Cryonics Institute. (On the
<br>
memo line of the check, usually at the lower left -- not on the payee
<br>
line -- you may write &quot;James Swayze Fund.&quot;) Mail it to Cryonics
<br>
Institute, 24355 Sorrentino Court, Clinton Township, Michigan 48035. You
<br>
will of course receive an acknowledgement. Donors' names and amounts will
<br>
be kept confidential if requested -- though we'd prefer to thank you
<br>
publicly and make your generosity public at some point.  Setting an
<br>
example for others could inspire others to help.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
2. We do not plan to announce the status of the fund until the goal of
<br>
$20,000 is conclusively passed. Otherwise, obviously, some potential
<br>
donors might hold off, hoping their own contributions will not be needed.
<br>
&nbsp;Please, don't hold off for any reason -- James' health is much more
<br>
problematical than that of most people, and it would be ghastly if he
<br>
were to miss his chance by a hair. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
3. Donations are not refundable, except as follows. If donations should
<br>
happen to exceed $33,000, the overage will be refunded pro rata (the same
<br>
percentage  of each donation will go back to each donor). If James should
<br>
die before the necessary amount is reached and he is not suspended by CI,
<br>
all donations will be refunded.  And if enough money is not raised over a
<br>
reasonable period, any donations made will be returned to those making
<br>
the donations.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I hope that all $33,000 can be raised.  But at the moment raising even
<br>
$10,000 (beyond the current pledges) could secure a cryonic suspension,
<br>
and the possiblity of a new life, for James Swayze.  $10,000 dollars
<br>
seems like a lot of money, I know.  But there are said to be approaching
<br>
a thousand people in the world who are signed-up members of cryonics
<br>
organizations.  Some are comfortably off, some of them are quite wealthy,
<br>
and all of them are able to meet the costs of membership and insurance. 
<br>
If each one sends in what he can afford without hardship, James Swayze
<br>
would be able to realize the hope all of us have -- a chance of a new and
<br>
healthy life in an amazing future. We've all seen a lot of disagreement
<br>
among cryonicists on this list.  Let's put it behind us, and pull
<br>
together this once, to help a friend--a man of extraordinary spirit, who
<br>
needs to have his extraordinarily bad luck mitigated.
