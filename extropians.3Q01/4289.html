Just a few data points.
<br>
1) Yesterday I reread Staring into the Singularity, and did a bit of 
<br>
arithmetic.  Assuming that in March the computer speed was, indeed, 
<br>
doubling every 18 mos.  And assuming, as indicated, that each successive 
<br>
doubling takes half the time of the previous one, then in March 2004 the 
<br>
curve goes vertical.
<br>
2) Yesterday in the news there was released an announcement of a 2GHz 
<br>
chip from a company that I had never heard of.
<br>
3) I'm told that for not too much one can fit a modern PC with a board 
<br>
that supports 8 way processing.
<br>
4) This morning I read in an old InfoWorld (2 weeks ago?) that IEEE 
<br>
1594b products will be released this fall, and that one implementation 
<br>
of it (using fiber optic cables) permits a 3.2 Gb (that's bit) 
<br>
connection over distances of 100 M.  These are expected to be boards 
<br>
that can be fitted into an ordinary PC.
<br>
5) Beowulf clustering is now becoming common.
<br>
6) I think it was in C Friendly AI that the projection was made that a 
<br>
minimum system needed by a seed AI would be 32 processors running at 2 GHz.
<br>
7) So by the end of the year it should be possible to put together a 
<br>
system about twice the minimum strength for around $10,000.
<br>
8) So by the early part of next year it should be possible to put 
<br>
together a rack-mount system containing 64 1U boxes linked with cheap 
<br>
hot-pluggagle connectors that are interlinked at high speed (ehternet or 
<br>
IEEE 1594b, depending on what's available) with each node at least a 
<br>
2GHz cpu (though the rack mount system would drive the price up a bit). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That fits in a one wide rack.  For less than, O, $20,000.
<br>
<p>Projection 8 can be done with currently available on the shelf hardware, 
<br>
except for the cpu speed.  The new stuff just makes it cheaper and 
<br>
faster (and slower, if you need to wait to get it and debug the setup).
<br>
<p>9) These rack mounts could easily be connected with a fast interchange. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Take one computer from each rack and devote it to managing task and 
<br>
information sharing between and withing racks.  You could fit an awful 
<br>
lot of racks along 100M of wall space.  And since they are lined up 
<br>
along a wall, they'd still all be easy to get into to fix.
<br>
<p>As always, software is the sticky point.  Unless someone has some 
<br>
intelligent code writing software...
<br>
<p>10) The assertion has been made that the more computing power you have, 
<br>
the easier it is to end up with an AI (though not necessarily a friendly 
<br>
one).  So by the middle of next year any reasonably profitable business 
<br>
should be able to put together enough computing power, if it chooses to.
