<p>I can see how a determined enemy may engage in an arms race in order to
<br>
overcome a shield perceived as being penetrable, but how does an
<br>
imperfect shield engcourage attacks?  It has long been an axiom of
<br>
statecraft that showing *weakness* is what encourages attack, and &quot;Who
<br>
desires peace should prepare for war.&quot;
<br>
<p>Even a very poor ABM system could succeed by encouraging potential
<br>
attackers to seek other means of imposing their will, and it seems very
<br>
unlikely that an opponent of limited resources would choose to confront
<br>
the defense directly.
<br>
<p>To believe that a shield would invite attack seems to require a
<br>
remarkable degree of doublethink.
