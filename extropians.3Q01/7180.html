<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Has the US actually made a formal declaration of war?  Is such

</em><br>
<em>&gt; If such a formal declaration is needed does it need to be against some
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>According to congressional sources, they seem to be of the opinion that
<br>
we need to know who it is we are fighting before we declare a war.
<br>
Giving the president carte blanche to declare war on anyone in their
<br>
place is a bit beyond the ability of congress to delegate. The current
<br>
declaration of congress that the president can take action against
<br>
anyone he determines to be bihind this and supporting this attack is
<br>
apparently about as far as they want to go at the moment.
