<em>&gt; It is my belief that Spielberg was unhappy with irony of this kind,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that this is why he'll always be a rather juvenile director.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it was NOT his intention that David was living in a simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the end of the movie.  I think it was his intention that David's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fortuitous hair-snatching managed to resurrect his mother, for Real,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if only for a little while.
</em><br>
<p>At first I thought he was living in a simulation when he opened his eyes
<br>
and found himself in his house.  The super-overexposed film processing
<br>
seemed to follow the cinematic convention for an unreal experience.
<br>
As the sequence went on the effect faded somewhat.  How would you
<br>
explain why it was filmed in this way, if not to indicate that he was
<br>
in a simulation?
<br>
<p>Even if it was a simulation, they still might have needed some DNA to
<br>
accurately re-create Monica in the sim.  Perhaps David's memories (plus
<br>
the echos in spacetime) were not sufficient to reproduce something as
<br>
complex as a human being.
<br>
<p>But if he was in a sim, why?  Maybe there was a shortage of wood around
<br>
to build houses?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With that said, I don't think Spielberg's intentions have to dominate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our interpretation of the film.  The BEST interpretation of the film
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is one in which Kingsley's character, the narrator/robot, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unreliable, or at least deceptive.  He doesn't tell David that it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all just a simulation; he fails to mention that they're only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resurrecting his mother for a day because that's all the energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're prepared to waste on him.  He just lets David believe that his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mother is Real.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I had a thought somewhat similar.  The robot's attitudes are strange
<br>
and a bit contradictory.  First David wishes to get his mother back.
<br>
This seems to stun and worry the robots and they look to their leader.
<br>
He pauses and finally grants permission.
<br>
<p>So we think we're going to see her.  But David awakens in an empty
<br>
house, and here comes the robot again to try to talk him out of it.
<br>
It's almost like they're having second thoughts about the whole thing
<br>
even though they already said they'd do it.
<br>
<p>So they make this excuse, we'd like to, but we have no DNA.  Why would
<br>
they say this now?  Didn't they think of that earlier when their leader
<br>
said to give David what he wanted?  Wouldn't one of them have spoken up
<br>
then and said, how will we do that when we don't have her DNA?
<br>
<p>Maybe they just thought they'd be able to find some of her DNA somewhere,
<br>
and they went and looked for a while, but no luck?
<br>
<p>But my reading was that they really didn't want to do it and the DNA was
<br>
just an excuse.  So here's Teddy showing up with some DNA.  Oops.
<br>
<p>(BTW why is it that we like Teddy so much?  He had hardly any lines
<br>
but somehow was one of the most appealing characters in the movie.
<br>
Good voice casting I guess.)
<br>
<p>So they've got the DNA, no more excuses, but now they try one last time
<br>
to talk David out of it with this story about only getting one day.
<br>
That doesn't work either so they finally have to go through with it.
<br>
<p>For some reason there is a profound reluctance on the part of the robots
<br>
to go through with Monica's resurrection (they offered to bring back
<br>
other people from David's time, but maybe they would have come up with
<br>
excuses about that, too).
