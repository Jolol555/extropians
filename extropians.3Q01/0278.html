<p>IN THIS ISSUE:
<p>Darrell Butler leads off this issue with an account of faculty and staff
development at the grassroots level. At Ball State University, a small
cadre of professors is spearheading the integration of information
technology into teaching and learning. Organized not by administrative
initiatives but by a common interest in technology's role in teaching and
learning, members of this unique group represent disciplines across campus
and meet regularly to discuss the theoretical issues and practical
applications of technology in education. Butler's article provides the
background for the three case studies in this issue, all of which were
written by members of Ball State's faculty technology group. (See
<a href="http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=904">http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=904</a>)
<p>In the first case study, an education professor describes her use of the
Web to showcase creative student ideas and archive them for general use by
the wider academic community. Susan Tancock, who teaches a course on
literary methods for preservice teachers, always encouraged her students
to develop and share best practices in literacy education. Until recently,
she recorded these practices in a single, limited location: a traditional
notebook accessible only during class and computer lab hours. As she
designed her first course Web site, Tancock realized the potential for an
electronic repository that would give preservice and practicing teachers
alike immediate, 24-hour access to a wealth of education resources. Read
on to find out how she transformed that standard notebook into an online
database and how her students augment it each semester--not only though
the generation of ideas but also through hands-on construction of their
own Web pages. (See
<a href="http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=885">http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=885</a>)
<p>In the second case study, William Bauer not only gives TS readers a look
at the use of Internet technology in music education, he also provides a
good summary of how computer technology can enhance learning in the
traditional, face-to-face classroom. Bauer has carefully integrated some
of the Internet's most common and useful tools in his courses in music
education, yielding a well-reasoned balance between traditional and
computer-based teaching practices--a refresher for those seeking to
improve their classroom teaching. (See
<a href="http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=884">http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=884</a>)
<p>In the third case study, Darrell Butler describes how he uses computer
technology when he teaches large lecture classes. Butler has formulated an
innovative strategy: he assigns students personal learning projects,
providing a means to employ student-centered pedagogies in an
instructor-centered course. As a result, computer technology can help
students with many aspects of the projects and it reduces Butler's
workload. See <a href="http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=864">http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=864</a>)
<p>James Morrison's interview with Jeanne Meister is an excellent commentary
on the state of corporate e-learning--its advantages, its challenges, and
its future. Corporate universities, educational organizations that develop
the competencies of employees, suppliers, and even customers, are
innovative, flexible, and increasingly important, Meister argues. She
highlights a number of their best practices--including the &quot;apportionment&quot;
of learning, learner control of curricula, and the combination of
synchronous and asynchronous components--and points to a future in which
corporate universities will increase their ties to traditional
universities, leverage their knowledge to customers, and become involved
in elementary and high school education. (See
<a href="http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=888">http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=888</a>)
<p>Thomas A. Marino has the following commentary for instructors considering
developing information technology tools for teaching and learning: look
before you leap. Marino points out that a number of pitfalls await those
who head down this path, from scarce hardware, software, and funding to a
lack of support from administration, faculty, and students. Ultimately,
Marino believes that IT tools help students learn, but the choice to use
these tools involves a number of risks--especially for untenured faculty
members--that Marino carefully points out in his insightful essay. (See
<a href="http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=888">http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=888</a>)
<p>Robert Burnside's commentary on the state of e-learning and corporate and
university education is bound to raise some eyebrows. Burnside, the
research director of Corporate University Xchange, argues that
corporations, technology providers, and traditional and online
universities should bury the hatchet and agree to work together to provide
the education and training needs of today's working adult learners. Citing
examples of successful collaboration, Burnside notes that &quot;our current
best hope is to seek collaboration among partners who once viewed each
other as competitors, but who can gain much by working together.&quot; (See
<a href="http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=882">http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=882</a>)
<p>Peshe Kuriloff suspects that the &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to
e-learning employed by course management systems actually hinders
effective teaching. Course management systems, argues Kuriloff, threaten
the unity and individual identity of custom-designed course materials,
contain embedded assumptions about pedagogy to which instructors must
conform, and constrain innovation. In sum, &quot;they present a threat to
future innovations in teaching and learning.&quot; Kuriloff's penetrating
commentary is another chapter in the debate over these systems. (See
<a href="http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=899">http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=899</a>)
<p>Internet users frustrated with the performance of conventional search
engines might want to check out the tools described by Rich Cummins:
&quot;searchbots&quot; that return specific, useful hits for Internet queries.
Unlike regular search engines, searchbots--downloadable programs available
for free or a modest fee--search within defined parameters and in specific
sections of the Web. Most also summarize the results of a search in a Web
page or bibliography that can be saved along with the search string. All
in all, says Cummins, this more advanced way of searching saves
researchers and casual surfers alike time and energy. (See
<a href="http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=895">http://horizon.unc.edu/TS/default.asp?show=article&id=895</a>)
<p>Shared courseware, made available by publishers for use in online courses,
is not a topic of much conversation in the academic community. Stephen
Downes thinks it should be. In this issue, he focuses the Technology
Source Spotlight on XanEdu.com, one of the leaders in custom online
content development, XanEdu, provides full-text books and articles, ready
for publishing in online course packs. As Downes points out, &quot;XanEdu
solves one of the problems facing online learning: the capacity to provide
articles and resources to online students.&quot; However, he also notes that
fees are charged to students and paid to publishers, an arrangement that
leaves him wondering about where authors stand. For more about the pros
and cons of this arrangement, read on. (See
