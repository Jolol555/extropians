<p>
I propose that the UN passes this law of non-interference: 
<br>
<p>All nations have no right to interfere in other nation's affair, unless:
<br>
1) the other nation interferes in your nation's affair
<br>
2) the other nation voluntarily asks you to interfere
<br>
3) the other nation restricts its citizens from traveling freely
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1) Except where the (ex-)citizen returns without permission
<br>
<p>Note the third exception. This will prevent dictators from oppressing their people by allow people the freedom to leave their country with nasty policies or dictators without repercussions, as well as terminating the nasty practice of compulsory drafting.
<br>
<p>To make this law effective, a country must also have the right to restrict admission, and to execute punishment on people who return after they leave.
<br>
<p><p>It would have other repercussions:
<br>
1) Criminals can exit a country freely (but I wonder who else will dare accept them)
<br>
2) Spies can exit a country freely (but they cannot return)
<br>
3) People with politically convictions against the leaders of the country they currently reside in can leave it freely (to where they would prefer to go)
<br>
4) This would promote a &quot;free market&quot; of citizenship where people can choose which country they can reside in and leave freely to this country
<br>
5) This would make a country seriously reconsider what it can do for its people to retain them, possibly resulting in great improvements and more citizen benefits
<br>
6) Certain nations such as the US could no longer interfere in other nations' affairs just by claiming security interests, infringment of human rights or whatever, and perhaps they will no longer need to
