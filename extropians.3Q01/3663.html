<p>Natasha, calm down.  (&quot;If ... then this is an area to contemplate for your 
<br>
own communications skills&quot; sounds to me like it's intended as an insult.  
<br>
It's unwarranted here.)
<br>
<p><p>No one said anyone &quot;considered humans to be foolish&quot;.  Eliezer was trying 
<br>
to tell you that he thinks people who say &quot;I am a transhuman&quot; sound to 
<br>
non-extropians like they are are putting on airs.  He doesn't think humans 
<br>
are foolish and he doesn't think you do either.  That's why it's worth 
<br>
pointing out to you that that's what it might sound like to some people.  
<br>
If you don't want them to hear that, you might consider different 
<br>
terminology.
<br>
<p>If you disagree with him that anyone hears it that way, that's a different 
<br>
thing you might argue with Eliezer about.  If you think there aren't many, 
<br>
or that the ones who do aren't worth considering, then you might bring 
<br>
those facts up.  (It's because I think that you will consider the opinions 
<br>
of only a few members of the public to be important that I bring this up, 
<br>
not because I think it likely that you will think it's good to ignore their 
<br>
opinion.)
