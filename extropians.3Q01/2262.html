<p><em>    &gt; The idea that light could traverse millions of lightyears without losing
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; energy always seemed to me a dubious one. Because light can't lose energy
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; in its intensity like sound does, it would need to lose it in its  wavelength.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting timing, the last 2 nails in the coffin of Franz Zwicky's tired light
<br>
theory happened just a few weeks ago, see an article called &quot;Tired Light
<br>
Hypothesis gets retired&quot; in the June 29 2001 issue of the journal Science,
<br>
page 2414. Briefly it's about 2 studies, one involving how the red shift of
<br>
very distant supernovas correlates with their observed brightness, the other
<br>
study involved galaxies. Both results fit the big bang prediction beautifully,
<br>
they doesn't come close to the tired light prediction. Science calls the results
<br>
&quot;very unambiguous&quot; and as for those who still like tired light &quot; it is more a
<br>
problem for a psychological journal than for Science.&quot;
<br>
<p>Personally I also think the steady state theory is much more elegant than
<br>
the big bang, but that's not the way things are. If I were God I would have done
<br>
things differently but unfortunately I was not given the job.
