<p>Why does one need fiber to the home? It's great if you can have it, but
<br>
what's wrong with wireless and LoS to the home? A cell can be a few 100 m
<br>
wide, and the routers you would of course want to interconnect with fiber
<br>
or equivalent. And of course the wireless nodes themselves could route,
<br>
thlus eliminating any need for infrastructure. If you have a client
<br>
device, you're part of the infrastructure.
<br>
<p>Sure broadband is nice, but I'll be very happy if I can send a few packets
<br>
of data to any device on Earth surface within few 10 s latency. 10 kBps

~100 ms latency with good QoS is hog heaven.

<p><p>I'm getting 1 MBps, which is sufficient for 99% of my current needs. This

is six orders of magnitude remote from TBps fiber to the home. I do not

anticipate to need more than 100 MBps for the next decade or two.

<p><em>&gt;

<p>Sure, but why on earth insist on fiber if you can have cheaper
<br>
alternatives, now?
