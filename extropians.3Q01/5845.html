<p>It's not just the OS, the whole architecture is fux0red. I can imagine

hierarchical FPGAs being anywhere in the ballpark of a small insect, but

the usual Jaquard-derived architectures are just ridiculous. CPU smart,

memory dumb. Mill, mill, mill, iterate sequentially. Bleh. Makes one wants

to reexamine which century we're in.

<p><em>&gt; that supporting GMP as a feature of the OS makes it architecturally a

<p>If you have 1e6 nodes, you most assuredly would want to cut down the

<br>
<p><em>&gt; isn't a lot of appropriate hardware to run it on lying around.

</em><br>
<p>Parallelism is parallelism, the brain is massively/embarrasingly parallel,
<br>
yet it is certainly not very Rube Goldberg. So, we should not be limited
<br>
to the state of the art when discussing future architectures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nobody designs computer hardware and operating systems for GMP, as it
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Clusters are great for protypes, but prototypes is all they're good for.
<br>
Excellent bang for the buck, but it grows stale in realtime.
