</em><br>
<p>It is expensive and difficult to harden many targets. And a policy of
<br>
shooting down off course aircraft will of course mean that bloody
<br>
accidents where innocents are killed are going to happen every few years
<br>
- is that price worth the slight safety improvement?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The big problem is that we don't have any good solutions to it: the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; standard response at present is to demand that Big Brother save us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; through Echelon, Carnivore and DMCA - which will not really work,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; quite likely make people feel even more alienated against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government, increasing risks of new attacks. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  Although DMCA has nothing to do with detecting or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preventing  any sort of terrorist activity.  
</em><br>
<p>True (although M$ and RIAA might disagree). But it is part of the same
<br>
meme complex: information must be controlled. The originating reasons
<br>
are of course different, but the basic problem for all the interests
<br>
behind these systems is that if information is power, then it must be
<br>
controlled so that they (and those groups they work for, including of
<br>
course civilian governments) can retain it. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transparent society might at least keep some civil liberties and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; remain an open society, but the cultural changes needed will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather wrenching. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The biggest change required is that governments be severely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited from interfering with individual rights and with any and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all behaviors that do not directly harm or defraud others. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transparency is not safe unless governments are forbidden to act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the information received to suppress unpopular attitudes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activities or to attempt to force compliance with government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endorsed positions. 
</em><br>
<p>The transparency option needs a big number of what Brin calls
<br>
&quot;antibodies&quot;, those people brave and tenacious enough to keep poiting
<br>
out abuses and demanding their rights. Without enough of them it will of
<br>
course not work. This is why the transparency option needs more than
<br>
just small cameras, it needs a cultural awareness of the need for
<br>
freedom and the need to stand up for one's rights. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Of these partial solutions, some appear more promising than others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The transparent society ideas of accountability and the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trace stuff would help discourage the more rational irrationalists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and might even allow the discovery of dangerous plots before they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are executed. If these traits could be combined with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; self-enforcing structure (legal, economic, software, whatever) that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; prevents abuse, much would be won. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But who gets to define what is and isn't abuse?  Some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current definitions of those in power in the US and elsewhere in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world would lead straight to a more rigid and horrific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totalitarian state than the world has ever seen.  As long as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political theory and practice is highly irrational, our best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protection is in what privacy we have and what inefficiencies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for enforcement of government will that exist now.  I will live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (but not happily of course) with the threat of terrorism rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than under the grim certainty of a totalitarian state.
</em><br>
<p>True. Of course, totalitarian states tend to breed terrorists too, so
<br>
you will not even be safe in that case. 
<br>
<p>In the end abuse has to be citizen-defined, and it needs to be defined
<br>
in such a way that the power of definition cannot be taken away from the
<br>
citizenship. How to achieve that is an important question, I really
<br>
hope we can rise to the challenge and come up with creative answers that
<br>
can be implemented. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; We need more than just the need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for court orders to bring out keys from escrow, something that can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be easily subverted by a new regime. Distributed encrypted legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; smart contracts, perhaps?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Fifth Amendment should cover the right of any and all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persons not to diverge their electronic information.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information should be seen as a direct extension of the person's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind.  It should be as illegal for the court to order it open as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the court to order truth-serum to be administered to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defendant.  Nothing less imho will protect us as individuals as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we become more intimately augmented by electronic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational devices.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, but the worrying trend right now is in the other direction. I
<br>
noticed yesterday that brain fingerprinting is now admissible in US
<br>
courts, although I guess that is hard to do on a resisting subject. This
<br>
right to informational integrity is important, and despite the awful
<br>
implementations of it here in the EU, at least some parts of it is
<br>
getting into law (unfortunately, just parts and there are many
<br>
contradictions with equally sweeping police rights). Of course, this is
<br>
an area where crypto can help a bit, but we still need the legal and
<br>
ethical infrastructure to make the use of crypto legal. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The risk with disasters like today is that people feel powerless and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stressed, and hence opt for the easiest solutions rather than think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of new ones.  We have a huge problem, we need to solve it, and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; need a *good* solution. Otherwise this will happen again and again,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on larger and larger scales.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could see a more transparent society (in both directions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public and private) with and only with severe restrictions on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government and corporate meddling with individual rights.  
</em><br>
<p>It is a feedback loop: in a somewhat transparent society, anybody
<br>
meddling with your rights is more easily exposed, and meddling doesn't
<br>
pay as much as before. That helps make the society more transparent. On
<br>
the other hand, the reverse is also true. That is why we need those
<br>
antibodies. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; On today's tragedy, I wonder whether these planes were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simultaneously hijacked in a coordinated matter (difficult) or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether the automatic guidance systems were somehow subverted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and made impervious to manula override.  Just a thought.
</em><br>
<p>I think the first; to my knowledge (which is admittedly near zero) it is
<br>
not possible to completely override manual in airplanes.  This event
<br>
might however lead to the reverse: what if planes could be remote
<br>
controlled in the event of hijacking? I can envison a cryptographically
<br>
secure remote control system that could in certain emergencies override
<br>
the pilot. This is likely a Bad Idea - both a hacking opportunity par
<br>
excellence (even if it is based on some clever hardware scheme there are
<br>
always mistakes), and it would undermine the trust of the pilot and
<br>
plane. However, some might think it might be worth it.
