<p>I have pondered this comment in light of my experience with my
<br>
brother-in-law's brother-in-law, Arne Gutierrez.  Arne grew up
<br>
mostly in Mexico, got his degree in chemistry in Mexico, came to
<br>
Taxifornia, got a masters in chemistry from San Jose State U and
<br>
eventually a doctorate in chemistry from Stanford.  He now
<br>
works for a company in Redwood City that is finding ways
<br>
to make AIDS drugs in large quantities.
<br>
<p>Arne is logical to a fault, always a very deep thinker.  We discussed
<br>
the extrapolation of Moore's law down to nanoscale, we discussed
<br>
life extension techniques, we discussed artificial intelligence, all with
<br>
the logic of Mr. Spock, no problems.  But as soon as I hit cryonics,
<br>
he choked.  This logical scientist comes up with the *wackiest*
<br>
arguments against cryonics, so much so that I am totally baffled.
<br>
I dont even know how to argue against them.  He argues not that
<br>
cryonics will not work, but that it is a bad idea to do it.  This is the
<br>
only area on which he falls back on the value of tradition, and the
<br>
natural life cycle of humans, etc, or in other words, it really is a
<br>
good thing that all people die.  Im at a loss with him.  {8^D  spike
