<em>&gt; Thanks for the accolade, but actually, I don't refer to myself as an

atheist,
<br>

</em><br>
problem,
<br>
<em>&gt; not what is believed, and an atheist is one who believes that god

(whatever
<br>

</em><br>
<p>It seems to me no more a belief than the word &quot;asymptomatic,&quot; which means
<br>
&quot;without symptoms.&quot;  Borrowing Thomas Edison's quote, if I say &quot;I don't
<br>
believe in Mother Goose&quot; (and therefore call myself an amothergoosist) -
<br>
it's an informal use of the phrase &quot;I don't believe...&quot; used colloquially,
<br>
not meant to imply a &quot;belief system.&quot;  I call myself an atheist sometimes
<br>
and a nontheist sometimes - for the life of me I can't detect much
<br>
difference (only in other people's reactions, when I've been asked to repeat
<br>
the word &quot;nontheist&quot; a few times as they'd never heard the word before).  I
<br>
must say I've been tending to use the term nontheist more and more lately,
<br>
only because some people think atheism means &quot;against...&quot; (not
<br>
&quot;without...&quot;).  But in any case, I don't see how it's a belief.
