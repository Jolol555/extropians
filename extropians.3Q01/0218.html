&quot;Reason&quot;
<br>
<p>quoted Harvey Newstrom
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; More profound than the medical breakthroughs are the detailed arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; against these breakthroughs!  The counter-arguments are scare, and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suggest that longevity will give another Hitler a better chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to take over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the world.  They suggest that it would be horrible if money could buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; longevity, or if the rich got healthy before the poor.  There is an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doomsday scenario based on the horrors of longer life.  It is hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; imagine that these views *against* health and longevity even exist.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; article fairly presents opposing viewpoints, and the depth and strength 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those viewpoints is profoundly disturbing.
</em><br>
<p>And went on to conclude:
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is not unreasonable to assume that Western governments could quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cheerfully retard antiaging breakthroughs by a couple of decades in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;response
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to luddite and religious pressure groups. This has happened for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of reproduction and numerous drugs. If this comes to pass, we will all die
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of old age.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ergo, this would seem to be one of the more important items on our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;collective to do list -- to say the least.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this.
<br>
<p>I could only get the link to work for the life extension article. It is, in 
<br>
many ways, an impressive article: detailed, thoughtful, seemingly 
<br>
well-researched (though others may be better qualified than I to detect any 
<br>
technical errors).
<br>
<p>Like so many such articles by journalists, it makes an assumption that death 
<br>
is good and &quot;natural&quot; in the scheme of things and should not ultimately be 
<br>
fought against. We should simply try to be healthier during our allotted 
<br>
years, and this is the &quot;proper&quot; role of medicine.
<br>
<p>The fact that so many journos and other writers find any view other than the 
<br>
above almost inconceivable suggests that it is probably common in the wider 
<br>
community. The view that I imagine all on this list share, that there is so 
<br>
much to do that we need *much* more than the 70 or 80 or 90 years that 
<br>
constitute &quot;old age&quot;, probably has little popular resonance at this stage.
<br>
<p>I think a lot of work needs to be done, getting out the viewpoint that 
<br>
radical life extension would be a good thing - the same sort of work as many 
<br>
of us are putting into defending stem cell research, therapeutic cloning 
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>I don't know whether this list can really coordinate such work. I doubt it. 
<br>
Moreover, we all have different talents and different opportunities. But I'd 
<br>
encourage those of us whose abilities and opportunities are in this 
<br>
direction to write and speak whenever you can to respond about the supposed 
<br>
social and moral issues surrounding life extension technology. If a strong 
<br>
and seemingly reasonable message is getting out in numerous local forums, 
<br>
and in wider forums whenever one of us has the clout to be heard there, this 
<br>
must have a gradual effect in countering the anti-life-extension message (I 
<br>
originally wrote &quot;propaganda&quot;, but that word is not really right when we're 
<br>
dealing with thoughtful and sincere material that we happen to disagree 
<br>
with).
<br>
<p>Here in Australia, I've seen a lot of anti-life-extension material. I've 
<br>
seen very little in reply except from Damien, plus one pretty solid article 
<br>
that I had published a couple of years ago and a couple of stories that I've 
<br>
had published (which are not at all stridently pro-life-extension, so 
<br>
perhaps they don't count). I expect that you would all, in your various 
<br>
countries and states, have had similar experiences. There's a lot of work to 
<br>
do in producing solid material that might give pause to those who either 
<br>
haven't thought deeply about the issue or who imagine there is a justifiable 
<br>
consensus against the desirability of extended life spans.
