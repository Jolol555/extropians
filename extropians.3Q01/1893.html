This reminds me of the book, A View From The Year 3000: by Arturo Kukeni 
<br>
(Michael H. Hart) in which Chang Po-Yo is listed as the pre-emminent person 
<br>
of all time because, as a neuro-surgeon, he creatied brain replacement 
<br>
surgery (pseudo-immortality). The brain section is copied, sliced,replaced, 
<br>
until the entire brain is replaced. The book celebrated similar successes 
<br>
with other researchers, prior to this, involving body organs and tissue 
<br>
engineering.

<p>&lt;&lt; I can concieve of a very non-godlike automated system for uploading. You
<br>
&nbsp;need a scanner (lets say a nanotech version of the microtome slicer with
<br>
&nbsp;camera, giving detailled cell strcture data), an automated
<br>
&nbsp;reconstruction modeller that simply takes the data and does a fairly
<br>
&nbsp;simple conversion to a compartment model of the neurons and a runtime
<br>
&nbsp;system running the simulation. No need for even human-level AI anywhere,
<br>
&nbsp;although the pattern recognition aspect could likely be improved by some
<br>
&nbsp;extra smarts. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;A system able to *understand* a human mind in the same way as we might
<br>
&nbsp;understand (say) a two neuron network is another matter. That kind of
<br>
&nbsp;system might be able to know whether an uploading process would work or
<br>
&nbsp;not, but it seems that the understanding process might actually entail
<br>
&nbsp;an uploading of the person in consideration.
