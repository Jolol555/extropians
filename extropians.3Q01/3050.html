<p>
<em>&gt;From an extremely cursory examination of what Eric Chen Yixiong
</em><br>
has written, it would appear as though he disapproves of all
<br>
&quot;conflict&quot;, e.g.,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Hence, in a society with even one irrational member, we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to exercise censorship to prevent conflicts from occurring,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or we will have to live outside each other's influence.
</em><br>
<p>Sadly, one reading of this is to infer that what is being suggested
<br>
is that debate and pan-critical argumentation are non-optimal.
<br>
I bet that this is what is being meant.  Exactly the opposite is
<br>
true.
<br>
<p>(Yes, on another reading, &quot;irrationality&quot; is to be taken literally,
<br>
and &quot;conflicts&quot; are to be taken as the use of force, but I disagree
<br>
with this too, but for other reasons.)
