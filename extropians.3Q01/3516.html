<em>&gt;&gt; I am very curious about an historical event in which Joe Dees
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; was the alleged victim of an email campaign.  It has become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; unclear whether there was a &quot;campaign&quot; at all, or whether it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; was directed at his own personal email address (or a list to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; which he merely was subscribed), or to what degree people went
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in order to suppress dissenting views.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (I myself would prefer that Mr. Joe Dees tell his story first,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; if he is so inclined, in non-partisan objective language.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; And, if I'm not being insulting towards anyone with these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; requests (for which I do apologize), I would be very happy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; if all accounts were free of political partisan content,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; i.e., that no observer would be capable of determining
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; who was liberal or who was conservative, or whatever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Needless to say, insulting terms like &quot;droogies&quot; or whatever,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; should be omitted when it's just the facts that should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; foremost first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lee, Joe's alleged 'mailbomb campaign' was the same episode which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;described a few weeks ago, in which both Greg Burch and Max More agreed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with my recall of events. Where each person Joe disagreed with may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sent a few or a few dozen messages, Joe took it upon himself to reply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;repeatedly to EVERY person who posted something about firearms ownership
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he disagreed with, and persisted in slandering each person's sanity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;criminality, manhood, sexuality, etc. If ANYONE here operated a mailbomb
</em><br>
<em>&gt;campaign, it was Joe, which I think you will find the majority of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;list in agreement with me on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It's simple mathematics; when, say, in a coordinated suppression-by-swamping action, six people each send you an average of 200 emails, and you respond to all of them, you have posted 1200 responses.  And yes, I did insult people - back.  I was excoriated, and responded in kind.
