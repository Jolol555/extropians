<em>&gt; &gt;The *other*, equally important, completely independent reason is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that economies are too complex to be centrally administrated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;When quadrillions of decisions must be made, nearly optimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;decisions have to be made locally, in accordance with local
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; You must have missed my other post, I pointed out that we know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economics to be in the realm of non-linear dynamics and therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject to &quot;butterfly effects&quot; of individual consumers.
</em><br>
<p>No, I didn't miss it.  It just didn't do anything for me, and now
<br>
I know why.  The reason is that the so-called &quot;butterfly effect&quot;
<br>
dominates *all* human living.  Perhaps all of life, period.  For
<br>
example, one single germ gets on a little kid's hand, he rubs
<br>
his eye, gets sick, doesn't go to school the next day, so Billy
<br>
(Clinton) gets elected president of the 2nd grade, and... the
<br>
next thing you know, MONICA LEWINSKY!
<br>
<p>Of course this was known eons before someone wrote
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For want of a nail, the shoe was lost,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For want of the shoe, the horse was lost,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For want of the horse, the rider was lost,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For want of the rider, the battle was lost,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For want of the battle, the kingdom was lost,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all for the want of a horseshoe nail!
<br>
<p>I actually can't make any further progress on your point.  Why do
<br>
you suppose it appropriate to add to the present list
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  Human nature isn't yet sufficiently altruistic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  Centralized control is vastly too inefficient
<br>
<p>your third reason that communism must fail, and socialism must
<br>
be far from optimal to the same degree that it abandons capitalism,
<br>
namely your non-linear economics thesis?
