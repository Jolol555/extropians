<p>
How can the same system produce scientific elites and illiterates?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.techreview.com/magazine/sep01/reviews.asp">http://www.techreview.com/magazine/sep01/reviews.asp</a>
<br>
The United States by any conceivable measure has the finest scientists in the
<br>
world. But the rest of the population, by any rational standard, is abysmally
<br>
ignorant of science, mathematics and all things technical. That is the paradox
<br>
of scientific elites and scientific illiterates: how can the same system of
<br>
education that produced all those brilliant scientists also have produced all
<br>
that ignorance?
<br>
<p>The situation is not merely paradoxical; it's downright perilous.We face an
<br>
era that promises ever accelerating technological change in every aspect of
<br>
our lives, while at the same time the very survival of our civilization may
<br>
depend on our ability to make wise decisions about how to manage our
<br>
resources, our climate and our conflicts. In the next century, we will need to
<br>
be able to deal confidently with technical issues, and a responsible
<br>
electorate will need to have some reasonable mastery of how the world works.
<br>
<p>In these circumstances, an undergraduate major in science should be the best
<br>
possible preparation for any serious profession. Or, put another way, the
<br>
science major today should be what classical Greek and Latin were in the 19th
<br>
century, and the liberal-arts major was in the 20th: the union card required
<br>
to enter the professional world. Unfortunately, the science education we have
<br>
in place to provide this union card could not be less suited to the task.
<br>
<p>Science education in the United States today exists as a kind of mining and
<br>
sorting operation, in which we, the existing scientists, cull through what
<br>
comes our way, searching for diamonds in the rough that can be cleaned and cut
<br>
and polished into glittering gems just like us. The rest are cast on the slag
<br>
heap, left to fend for themselves with no basic understanding of the sciences.
<br>
The paradox of elites and illiterates exists because our system of science
<br>
education is designed to produce that result.
<br>
<p>The problem starts in grade school, where few children ever come into personal
<br>
contact with a scientifically trained person-including, unfortunately, their
<br>
teachers. In most of the United States the only way you can graduate from
<br>
college without taking a single science course is to major in elementary
<br>
education. And, it is said, many people major in elementary education for
<br>
precisely that reason. Our elementary school teachers are therefore not only
<br>
ignorant of science; they are hostile to science. That hostility must,
<br>
inevitably, rub off on the young people they teach.
<br>
<p>A few years ago, I was on a committee to look into how well the &quot;breadth&quot;
<br>
requirement-that all students take at least one course in science-was working
<br>
at one University of California campus. We found that, of those students not
<br>
majoring in a technical subject, 90 percent were satisfying the breadth
<br>
requirement by taking a single biology course known informally among the
<br>
students as &quot;Human Sexuality.&quot; Now, I don't for an instant doubt that it was a
<br>
useful and interesting course. It may even have tempted students to do
<br>
hands-on experiments on their own time (a result we seldom achieve in
<br>
physics). But I don't think it constitutes a sufficient education in science
<br>
for university graduates at the dawn of the 21st century.
<br>
<p>I also know a bit about what goes on at the secondary level because in the
<br>
1980s I made an educational TV series, The Mechanical Universe, that's still
<br>
widely used in U.S. colleges and high schools. There are about 24,000 high
<br>
schools in the United States. Nobody knows how many trained high school
<br>
physics teachers there are (with, say, the equivalent of an undergraduate
<br>
major in the subject) but certainly there are no more than a few thousand. I
<br>
made The Mechanical Universe primarily for the &quot;crossover&quot; teachers, those who
<br>
teach physics even though they weren't trained for it. It's a source of great
<br>
satisfaction that hundreds of teachers have thanked me for making it possible
<br>
for them to have successful careers. But guess what? They tell me their
<br>
greatest satisfaction is not in preparing the rest of their students to thrive
<br>
in an increasingly technical world, but in finding those diamonds in the rough
<br>
that can be sent on to college to be cut and polished into real physicists.
<br>
<p>But nowhere is the problem more vivid than in graduate school. Gradu­ ate
<br>
students are the elect, those selected to go on to the final stage of the
<br>
mining and sorting operation. The average professor in a research university
<br>
turns out about 15 PhDs in the course of a career. While the problem of
<br>
science education is often framed in terms of a perceived lack of PhDs-too few
<br>
elites to fuel our scientific and technological progress in the future-it's
<br>
clear we actually have a process in place equipped to multiply our kind 15
<br>
times over with each succeeding generation. What's lacking is a means to
<br>
provide the rest of our population with even the most basic understanding of
<br>
science in an increasingly science-driven world.
<br>
<p>My friends from around the country tell me that the number of undergraduate
<br>
physics majors is at its lowest point since Sputnik, nearly 50 years ago.
<br>
That's not surprising. The undergraduate major in physics is largely regarded
<br>
as preparation for graduate school, and the academic job market is still
<br>
saturated from the influx of baby boomer PhDs in the 1970s, dissuading
<br>
potential new candidates from pursuing an under­ graduate science degree.
<br>
Those without an interest in an academic profession don't see a degree in
<br>
physics as relevant. Thus, far from being the liberal-arts major of the 21st
<br>
century, the undergraduate science major has become an endangered species.
<br>
<p>Is there any conceivable remedy? Can we imagine a world in which we do better
<br>
than turn out a handful of PhDs, many of whom will wind up with little but
<br>
frustration to show for all their hard work, while the rest of the young
<br>
people who graduate from college are unprepared to cope with a society shaped
<br>
largely by science and technology? Of course, it would help if those of us who
<br>
teach science in college would change our own attitudes and devise more
<br>
inviting ways of presenting our subjects. But even if we could do that it
<br>
would barely make a dent in the problem. By the time the kids get to us, they
<br>
are already lost to science.
<br>
<p>But imagine a world in which teaching in high school is such an attractive
<br>
profession that it would be worth the trouble of a doctoral level education to
<br>
get the job. For that to happen, we would have to pay teachers more, at least
<br>
as much as what graduating doctoral students get. And they should be paid
<br>
more. But that's not the whole answer. Just as important, schools would have
<br>
to learn to treat these teachers with professional respect, and society would
<br>
have to afford them the honor and admiration that professionals expect. This
<br>
is not unthinkable. Something like it was true in much of Europe before World
<br>
War II. But it is very far from true in today's United States.
<br>
<p>Much more is needed, of course. The revolution would have to extend right down
<br>
to the first grade. Teachers would have to be literate in science, and kids
<br>
would have to find learning science as cool as following the fortunes of rock
<br>
groups. That's an awful lot to ask for. But then again, only our future
<br>
depends on it.
