<p>Wow! Forth! You remember Forth?!?! That is an incredible language. I could 
<br>
wax on about its amazing capabilities for ages. It is absolutely tiny, 
<br>
extremely fast, and lets you define everything as words in a dictionary. It 
<br>
was originally developed by Charles Moore (I think) to control telescopes. 
<br>
He needed something simple and easy to use. He also went on to design and 
<br>
build some wonderfully simple, extremely fast, parallel-processing CPUs 
<br>
that used Forth as their assembly language. In fact they were basically 
<br>
gate arrays, they were so simple. I don't know if they are available anymore.
<br>
<p>Maybe the main reason why many people resist using Forth is the reverse 
<br>
polish notation (anybody who has used an HP calculator will have no 
<br>
problems). But that does abolish parentheses and problems of precedence in 
<br>
evaluation. It just feels a bit unnatural for humans... at first.
<br>
<p>Another possible cause for the fact that it never took off in a big way is 
<br>
that each person builds up their own dictionary of definitions upon the 
<br>
standard base definitions. Naturally different people's definitions are not 
<br>
necessarily interoperable -- they need to use someone else's user 
<br>
dictionary... which is not always convenient. This is kinda a babel effect.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;Forth is used by the NSA and maybe ten to twenty companies worth knowing.
</em><br>
<p>Gosh! I didn't know that.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;[Deep dark secret: cnbc.com runs on Forth. You didn't hear it from me.

<em>&gt;There's an 8-bit JVM written in Forth for mobile phones too -- now that's

</em><br>
<p>Yes. It is a weird combination of interpreted and compiled language. :-)
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;But enough about Forth. I had a misspent youth, I admit it.

<p>Heheheh. Me too.  :-)

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
