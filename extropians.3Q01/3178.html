<em>&gt; &gt; Because in a racist society, black people are more likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrested,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; convicted and executed than white people. Black people make up a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; disproportionate number of recruits to the US armed forces, am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I to assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they are more patriotic than the white population?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Am I to assume that you think someone makes them enlist at gunpoint?
</em><br>
<p>It's called irony mate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What does that have to do with blacks being convicted more? Nothing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly, outside of a lack of avenues of escape from the ghetto. Having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been a member of the US armed forces myself, it is partly that, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partly that fewer whites think that risking one's life in the service is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth minimum wage pay and two tiered health care systems with a higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate of malpractice than the general medical industry, with less legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recourse. I went in for the college money (the GI Bill), which they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wound up defrauding me of once I was discharged.
</em><br>
<p>Boy, you do have a chip on your shoulder.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whites also don't join the military in similar numbers because whites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to have a higher respect for higher education than blacks and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better prepared for college than blacks. In the words of black comedian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chris Rock: &quot;Cut the 'racism' bullshit, and get off your ass.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Well that's intellectual rigour, quoting a comedian.
<br>
<p>I'm not going to argue with you any more Mike, because, I've spent many
<br>
years listening to your vitriol and inability to understand the concepts of
<br>
compassion or fairness, and watched many people I've admired on this list
<br>
waste countless hours on you. It's like talking to a brick wall - you never
<br>
answer questions directly, you misquote, you take out of context, you set up
<br>
straw men, you come across as rude, bullying and aggressive, you have never
<br>
once been wrong about anything (irony again!). I'm sorry if this is not how
<br>
you really are in real life and I expect you probably think you're an OK guy
<br>
yourself, but I honestly think as a lurker of longstanding (which you
<br>
doubted in your inimitable way in an earlier post, so as to cast doubt on my
<br>
opinion) this list would benefit from your absence.
