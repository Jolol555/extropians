<em>&gt; ### I think that this particular way of attacking can be easily thwarted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by installing a double steel door to the cockpit in all large airplanes -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anybody trying to enter would need to go through and close one door, look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up to the camera, be recognized by the pilots as the flight attendant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bringing refreshments, and have the inner door opened from the cockpit. As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long as pilots under no circumstances deviate from the policy and never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yield to terrorists killing the people in the main cabin, there would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely no way to gain control of the airplane. No high tech and no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mounds of money needed.
</em><br>
<p>According to the aviation expert on ABC News, they can't strengthen
<br>
the door too much between the cockpit and the cabin because of concerns
<br>
about depressurization.  In the event of a loss of pressure accident,
<br>
it is imperative that pressures be quickly equalized between cockpit and
<br>
cabin, otherwise something horrible will happen.  He didn't say what,
<br>
but I gather that the plane would fall apart.  As a result, the doors
<br>
presently have specially weakened panels which blow out if there is a
<br>
pressure difference.  According to this expert, &quot;you can't put a bank
<br>
vault door up there.&quot;
