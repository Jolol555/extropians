<em>&gt; WASHINGTON -- When last I took a Labor Day occasion to compare the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is there a problem?  spike
</em><br>
<p>Three problems, actually.
<br>
<p>The corporate problem: bosses are supposed to run companies for their
<br>
shareholders, not for their own pockets. Private companies: the bosses
<br>
_are_ the shareholders, so that's okay. But these figures point to 
<br>
the executives of public corporations ripping off their shareholders.
<br>
<p>The social problem: a widening gap between the remuneration of the
<br>
bosses and workers is divisive and encourages social unrest. A lot of
<br>
people don't see how some guy sitting in an office for the 40 hours of
<br>
the week when he isn't on the golf course can be doing something worth,
<br>
say, a million bucks a year, when similar guys down on the shop floor
<br>
are bending metal and producing goods for a fiftieth of that. The root
<br>
of this social problem is that the marginal value of money declines as
<br>
you acquire more.  (The difference a thousand bucks makes to you if you
<br>
already have $100K is minimal compared to the difference it makes if
<br>
you have only $5K.)
<br>
<p>The economic problem: our economy needs consumers with disposable incomes
<br>
to keep buying goods to keep the companies in business. Impoverished
<br>
workers don't buy goods. The economy therefore has a smaller market.
<br>
By giving the workers more money to spend, in the broader picture,
<br>
bosses can expand the overall size of the market (and ultimately reap
<br>
bigger long term rewards).
