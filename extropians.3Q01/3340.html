I like your post, Spike. Apologies in advance for snipping all the good
<br>
bits!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you have access to Murray and Herrnstein's The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bell Curve, do read their introduction, where they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acknowledge that differences in race is a terribly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult topic to study or even discuss.  They lay out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their approach, to be as honest, open minded, fair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and logical as is humanly possible.  Whether or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we agree with their conclusions, Murray and Herrnstein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are worth the time to read methinks, as are their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many opponents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Just to spill a few more worms from our already battered can, I've got to
<br>
take issue with reference to The Bell Curve. As far as I am aware, this book
<br>
has been thoroughly debunked... here are a couple of quick references that I
<br>
scratched (or googled) up.
<br>

<br>
&quot;Take the racist beliefs of the Ku Klux Klan or the Aryan Nation. Cloak
<br>
those beliefs in academic robes and what do you get? You get a best seller.&quot;
<br>

<br>
The Bell Curve sets up several premises which together add up to an ugly
<br>
policy for America posing as science. Here's how to kill it. 
<br>
<p>Also, I think that Stephen J Gould hammers it pretty hard in &quot;The Mismeasure
<br>
of Man&quot;.
