<em>&gt;From: &quot;Olga Bourlin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:fauxever@sprynet.com?Subject=Re:%20SOCIETY:%20Re:%20The%20privatization%20of%20public%20security%20in%20South%20America&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108201507.IAA08230@well.com&gt;">fauxever@sprynet.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;I personally don't understand the trust libertarians in general
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seem to put on &quot;the individual.&quot;  I don't recall reading of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time in our history (U.S. history) when libertarianism was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supposedly in bloom, and when peace, prosperity and goodwill
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reigned.  If there was such a time (a better time for citizens in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the U.S., compared to recent years), I'd like to know when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that time was.
</em><br>
<p>There was no &quot;golden age of Libertarianism&quot;, and individualism and
<br>
Libertarianism are completely different.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My dear husband and I were recently talking, and something he said
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really caught my attention.  He speculated that if past failures
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of statist economies can often be attributed to mismanagement of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;faulty data, then with the advent of advances such as artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligence, comprehensive economic data on both macro- and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;micro- levels, as well as more refined modeling and forecasting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;techniques, there is no reason why centrally controlled economies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may not turn out to be the more effective system, after all, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the future.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is not a new idea, and it's inaccuracies are well known. First
<br>
we do not have an exact science of economics, and second we know
<br>
economics to be in the realm of non-linear dynamics( &quot;chaos&quot;
<br>
theory). Certain processes within these systems may be predictable
<br>
(see the book &quot;The Prediction Company&quot; or visit www.predict.com)
<br>
but the system as a whole has far to much volatility (information)
<br>
to yield to central planning.
<br>
<p>Wealth redistribution schemes are established failures for a number
<br>
of reasons. First, you are rewarding failure so the predictable
<br>
result is more failure. Second, giving money to people is like
<br>
giving morphine, it solves an immediate problem, but they quickly
<br>
develop a dependancy, this happens to wealthy and well educated
<br>
people as easily as poor uneducated ones. The solution is a limited
<br>
time exposure, then they have to be weaned off of it.
<br>
<p>Elementary non-linear dynamics, cybernetics, economics, and social
<br>
theory.
