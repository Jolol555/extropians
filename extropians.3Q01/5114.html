&quot;Like Olga, I also went to a public school. I seem to have turned out OK...&quot;
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>I also went to a public school, the demographic was probably lower middle
<br>
class.  I graduated with a bitter resentment to education.  I had two
<br>
extraordinary teachers in all of high school, many mediacore ones, and one
<br>
who proclaimed to not like teaching or kids, and failed half the kids in her
<br>
class.  Public high school did nothing but turn me away from education and
<br>
learning.  It was not till after high school on my own that I changed and
<br>
begin persuing more intellectual things.  
<br>
<p>Regardless though, this has no impact of the overall statement that public
<br>
schools are less effecient, more expensive, and overall of poorer quality
<br>
then would be private competing schools.  Your statments of 'I went to
<br>
public school and turned out ok' are just as irrelevant to the discussion as
<br>
someone saying 'My friend Beth is taller then my friend Joe' when someone
<br>
says that  *On average* men are taller then women.  *On average* public
<br>
schools suck.  There may be some rare ones that happen to get a
<br>
statistically high amount of good teachers, caring professionals, and
<br>
rational and logical administration.  They are, however, the exception.  
<br>
<p>Competing private schools have an economic incentive to provide a better
<br>
education, public schools do not.  They recieve thier pay and money
<br>
regardless.  Although some programs have recognized the abysmal state of the
<br>
public school system and are attempting to resolve this by basing funding on
<br>
standardized test scores and such.
<br>
<p>Regards..
