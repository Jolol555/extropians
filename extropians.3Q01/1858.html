<em>&gt;&gt; Oh, of course, how silly of me! And here I thought it was to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; colonisation and rape of lands, accidents of geography, desertification,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; aftermath of wars, and so on that caused third world countries to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; underdeveloped.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seems to me there is no one explanation to the dilemma of disparity.  I got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some insights from Jared Diamond's book &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot; ...
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that is an absolutely terrific book.  He says things that
<br>
were simply beyond the pale twenty years ago.  (By the way, thanks
<br>
for the correction of &quot;vail&quot; to &quot;vale&quot; as in &quot;vale of tears&quot;.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...  It is interesting to speculate how so-called underdeveloped countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will reap benefits from technology in the future.  Will there ever be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equalization of brains, beauty, brawn and beaucoup bucks?
</em><br>
<p>I think not.  At least the pattern in the history of wealth
<br>
distribution has been (over a big historical average), the
<br>
greater the total wealth, the greater the difference between
<br>
the typical rich and the typical poor.  The Pareto distribution,
<br>
if I recall correctly---much used by economists to model wealth
<br>
distributions---has as a characteristic that the ratio of the
<br>
very wealthiest to the poorest increases inexorably with wealth.
<br>
But I don't really care so much; just so long as the poor also
<br>
get richer.
<br>
<p>In the future, there will be those who upload and then transform
<br>
themselves at a dizzying speed into something of no real resemblance
<br>
to their former selves and who will leave those of us who are more
<br>
cautious in the dust.  Likewise, those of us who cautiously upload,
<br>
and prudently run lots of more primitive versions of ourselves
<br>
in the background, will leave far behind the Amish, or even those
<br>
that have a less burning desire to become more intelligent.
<br>
Thus disparity (and diversity) will increase.
<br>
<p>Lee
