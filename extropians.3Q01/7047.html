<p>Another simple and undisputable fact is that people who believe in a Book
<br>
will usually just ignore aspects of the Book that conflict with their
<br>
actual philosophies.  Try asking some professional, educated Jewish women
<br>
whether the Old Testament is a male chauvinist document.
<br>
<p>The Koran may endorse violence against unbelievers, but it is quite
<br>
possible that modern Islam does not.  I doubt if many modern Jews would
<br>
endorse genocide, for all that they were instructed to erase the memory of
<br>
Amalek from beneath the heavens.
<br>
<p>Now we can, of course, regard this as an opportunity to point out once
<br>
again that religion is not rational.  But the more important point
<br>
currently is that the loose logical structure of religion means that
<br>
religionists have a culture which is quite separate from their books.  It
<br>
is quite possible that mainstream modern-day Islam does not tolerate
<br>
violence regardless of what the Koran says - although I know too little
<br>
about Islam to say so one way or the other, and the little I do know seems
<br>
to indicate that Islam is a modern-day warrior religion in the same way
<br>
that Orthodox Judaism is a modern-day scholarly religion.
<br>
<p>Anyway, arguing about Islam from the Koran may be as specious as supposing
<br>
that Jewish rabbis bear some resemblance to the characters or authors in
<br>
the Old Testament.
