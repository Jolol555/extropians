<p>One of the less mentioned applications of the PAC3 missile is
<br>
an anti-aircraft weapon.  The Patriot missile started life as an
<br>
anti-aircraft system, but later versions were named Patriot
<br>
Advanced Capability, or PAC, since its role was expanded
<br>
to include warhead intercept.
<br>
<p>The failed July 9 PAC3 intercept attempt was only partially
<br>
unsuccessful, since it was a simultaneous firing of two missiles,
<br>
one at an incoming warhead, the other at a drone aircraft which
<br>
was using all the latest and greatest evasive technologies other
<br>
than full-on stealth, i.e: radar jamming, flares, chaff, endgame
<br>
manuevering, other goodies still in the bag.  The warhead was
<br>
missed but the airplane was hit.  I notice they arent scheduling
<br>
any more PAC3 tests against aircraft targets.  Generally the
<br>
customer will not do a test in which the target has much less
<br>
than about a 50-50 chance of escaping.
<br>
<p>Looks to me like the world is on the verge of rendering fighter
<br>
planes useless, if ground based lasers and PAC3 missiles are
<br>
sold around the globe.  These ground based systems would cost
<br>
pennies on the dollar what it would cost to maintain a modern
<br>
air force.
<br>
<p>That would be a kick, eh?  If defensive technology really did
<br>
finally gain the upper hand on offensive tech?  If the world's
<br>
military forces began investing more in anti-aircraft weapons
<br>
instead of the jets?  Military expenditures started *dropping*
<br>
world wide?  Bad for business I suppose, but it would make
<br>
me the happiest poor guy you ever saw.  spike
