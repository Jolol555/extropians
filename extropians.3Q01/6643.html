</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Arguably even more so, as we have more options, and 
<br>
would likely kill far more people .  In this
<br>
war our enemy is an ideology,
<br>
not a people or even a government.  I believe we will
<br>
benefit most if we frame our actions in terms of what
<br>
will most weaken this fundamentalist brand of Islam.
<br>
Stripping the Taliban of control of Afghanistan would
<br>
be beneficial but harming the people who live there 
<br>
just validates their claim that the US is evil.  The
<br>
choice of war hinges on whether we can keep inevitable
<br>
civilian Muslim casualties low enough to still see
<br>
a net gain from improving the local governement/theocrats.
<br>
<p>PS sorry about the HTML, folks.  Does anybody know
<br>
how to turn this off in AOL 6.0 or must I switch providers?
