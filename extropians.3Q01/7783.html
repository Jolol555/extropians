FBI Agent Finds Prayers and a Checklist of Practical Terrorism
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/34031.html">http://www.iht.com/articles/34031.html</a>
<br>
WASHINGTON Mohamed Atta, one of the key organizers among the 19 hijackers who
<br>
carried out the Sept. 11 attacks, left behind a five-page handwritten document
<br>
in Arabic that includes Islamic prayers, instructions for a last night of life
<br>
and practical reminders to bring &quot;knives, your will, IDs, your passport&quot; and,
<br>
finally, &quot;to make sure that nobody is following you.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
FBI investigators, who found the writings in Mr. Atta's luggage, which did not
<br>
make it onto his flight, are not sure of the author's identity - whether it
<br>
was Mr. Atta, another hijacker or someone else.
<br>
.
<br>
The document is a cross between a chilling spiritual exhortation aimed at the
<br>
hijackers and an operational mission checklist. With the hijackers all dead,
<br>
the pages may turn out to provide the most vivid and penetrating glimpse into
<br>
their mental states and final hours before they embarked on the deadliest act
<br>
of terrorism in U.S. history.
<br>
.
<br>
The haunting writings urge the hijackers to crave death and &quot;be optimistic.&quot;
<br>
At the same time, the document starkly addresses fear on the eve of their
<br>
suicide mission.
<br>
.
<br>
&quot;Everybody hates death, fears death,&quot; according to a translation of highlights
<br>
of the document obtained by The Washington Post. &quot;But only those, the
<br>
believers who know the life after death and the reward after death, would be
<br>
the ones who will be seeking death.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
This appears in a section of the document beneath the words &quot;The last night.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
That section begins this way: &quot;Remind yourself that in this night you will
<br>
face many challenges. But you have to face them and understand it 100 percent.
<br>
... Obey God, his messenger, and don't fight among yourself where you become
<br>
weak, and stand fast, God will stand with those who stood fast.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
The translated version of the document instructs the hijackers to steel their
<br>
will with prayer before embarking on their mission:
<br>
.
<br>
&quot;You should pray, you should fast. You should ask God for guidance, you should
<br>
ask God for help. ... Continue to pray throughout this night. Continue to
<br>
recite the Koran.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
It continues: &quot;Purify your heart and clean it from all earthly matters. The
<br>
time of fun and waste has gone. The time of judgment has arrived. Hence we
<br>
need to utilize those few hours to ask God for forgiveness. You have to be
<br>
convinced that those few hours that are left you in your life are very few.
<br>
<em>&gt;From there you will begin to live the happy life, the infinite paradise. Be
</em><br>
optimistic. The prophet was always optimistic.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
The document offers eerie practical advice for the hijackers: &quot;Check all of
<br>
your items - your bag, your clothes, knives, your will, your IDs, your
<br>
passport, all your papers. Check your safety before you leave. ... Make sure
<br>
that nobody is following you.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
Interwoven throughout is spiritual guidance on purifying one's mental and
<br>
physical state. The document says, &quot;Make sure that you are clean, your clothes
<br>
are clean, including your shoes.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
A recurring theme is the promise of eternal life: &quot;Keep a very open mind, keep
<br>
a very open heart of what you are to face. You will be entering paradise. You
<br>
will be entering the happiest life, everlasting life.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
Mr. Atta, 33, and Abdulaziz Alomari spent the night of Sept. 10 in Room 232 of
<br>
the South Portland Comfort Inn in Portland, Maine. Early on Sept. 11, they
<br>
boarded a flight from Portland to Logan Airport, in Boston, where they
<br>
connected to American Airlines Flight 11, the plane that was commandeered and
<br>
flown into the north tower of the World Trade Center.
<br>
.
<br>
Mr. Atta's luggage did not make it onto Flight 11. The FBI found another copy
<br>
of essentially the same document in the wreckage of United Flight 93, a
<br>
government source said. Flight 93 was also hijacked and crashed into a field
<br>
in Pennsylvania. The multiple copies suggest that the document was shared
<br>
among at least some of the hijackers.
<br>
.
<br>
After the attacks, several published reports said that Mr. Atta had left a
<br>
&quot;suicide note,&quot; which is what the FBI initially called it in a document sent
<br>
to police investigators in Europe. Other reports called it a will written by
<br>
Mr. Atta, an Egyptian who joined radical Islamic circles while studying urban
<br>
planning in Germany.
<br>
.
<br>
The first four pages of the document are handwritten on large paper and recite
<br>
some basic Islamic history about the Prophet fighting infidels with 100 men
<br>
against 1,000. They also include prayers such as &quot;I pray to you, God, to
<br>
forgive me from all my sins, to allow me to glorify you in every possible
<br>
way.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
The fifth and last page is on standard stenographic paper that had apparently
<br>
been ripped from a pad and is headed, &quot;When you enter the plane.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
It includes a series of prayers or exhortations:
<br>
.
<br>
&quot;O God, open all doors for me. O God, who answers prayers and answers those
<br>
who ask you, I am asking you for your help. I am asking you for forgiveness. I
<br>
am asking you to lighten my way. I am asking you to lift the burden I feel. O
<br>
God, you who open all doors, please open all doors for me, open all venues for
<br>
me, open all avenues for me.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
The author doodled on the paper, drawing a small, arrowhead-like sword. Two
<br>
circles entwine the shaft, which also has serpentine swirls drawn onto it. The
<br>
doodle also resembles a key.
<br>
.
<br>
The word ROOM is written vertically in large double-block letters at the end.
<br>
.
<br>
The document continues: &quot;God, I trust in you. God, I lay myself in your
<br>
hands.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
It closes: &quot;There is no God but God, I being a sinner. We are of God, and to
<br>
God we return.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
The document, several scholars of Islam said, draws on traditional Islamic
<br>
prayers and alludes to Koranic verses. It begins with the universal Islamic
<br>
benediction recalling God's mercy and compassion. And the last two paragraphs
<br>
repeat the basic Muslim belief that &quot;there is no God but God.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
But some scholars noted that words like &quot;100 percent&quot; and &quot;optimistic&quot; are
<br>
modern vocabulary not found in ancient prayers.
<br>
.
<br>
&quot;Except for the section that talks about going into a plane and the knives,
<br>
virtually everything else you could find in some medieval devotional manuals,&quot;
<br>
said John Voll of the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown
<br>
University.
<br>
.
<br>
It seems to have been written, Mr. Voll added, &quot;by a person who lives in a
<br>
devotional environment that involves a significant amount of memorized
<br>
material.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
&quot;It is embedded in a broad Islamic devotional discourse,&quot; he added.
<br>
.
<br>
Other scholars noted the document's use of Islamic language to clothe a call
<br>
to action.
<br>
.
<br>
&quot;The jargon is authentic Islamic jargon,&quot; said Imad ad Dean Ahmad, the
<br>
president of the Minaret of Freedom Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. &quot;It's
<br>
obviously phrased to make it sound like it's part of a message to people going
<br>
on a mission from which they will not return.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
Richard Martin, professor of Islamic studies at Emory University, said that
<br>
the document appeared to refer to &quot;the purification that martyrdom represents&quot;
<br>
before it gets to &quot;the quotidian matters of entering the airplane and gives
<br>
final instructions.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
Mr. Martin added, &quot;This is a kind of spiritual preparation as I read it, or so
<br>
it sounds.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
But two scholars said they found &quot;incongruous&quot; the opening line that refers to
<br>
praying &quot;in the name of God, of myself and my family&quot; because Muslims do not
<br>
pray in their name or their families' names.
<br>
.
<br>
Jonathan Brockopp, assistant professor of Islamic studies at Bard College,
<br>
noted another incongruity in the statement about seeking death.
<br>
.
<br>
In mainstream Muslim tradition, Mr. Brockopp said, &quot;there is an important
<br>
distinction between suicide and martyrdom in that martyrs don't seek death.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
&quot;A martyr seeks to glorify God and be God's instrument,&quot; he said, &quot;and is not
<br>
necessarily seeking death.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
The idea &quot;of not seeking death,&quot; Mr. Brockopp added, &quot;is tremendously
<br>
important in Muslim tradition.&quot;
<br>
.
<br>
But he noted that Islamic extremists had recently arrived at their own
<br>
interpretations of these early Muslim teachings and that the document's author
<br>
appeared to follow the extremist view.
<br>
.
<br>
Finally, Mr. Brockopp said that he found certain phrases like &quot;lighten my way&quot;
<br>
and &quot;lift the burden&quot; typical of self-exhortations made by &quot;a person who joins
<br>
a charismatic community or cult&quot; and then tries &quot;to do something beyond
<br>
impossibility.&quot;

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
<br>
<p>&quot;Socialism was scary. It claimed the lives of tens of millions of innocent
<br>
people. But this religious mass socio-genic illness promises to murder
<br>
everyone, even its own zombie minions, to fulfill  prophecies of Armageddon
<br>
and Judgment Day myths.&quot;
