<em>&gt; Believers often render unbelievers (real people) to the status of

<em>&gt; &quot;invisible,&quot; all the while lending reality to the &quot;invisible.&quot;  Don't ask.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nontheists do not HAVE to make &quot;enemies&quot; of believers - this is, after all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a pluralistic society.  And believers need to &quot;understand&quot; that just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, etc., there are nontheists in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; midst, too.  Believers also need to understand that we do not just have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom of religion, but freedom from religion, as well.  Was it Clinton(?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who not too long ago came up with the brilliant quote along the lines of,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Just because we have freedom of religion doesn't mean we have freedom from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion?&quot;   Sheeesh.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>At a time like this to be focusing on such side issues and squabbles is 
<br>
simply bizarre to me.  Freedom of religion includes the freedom for
<br>
a US president to mention God if God is meaningful to him/her and to
<br>
the audience in the situation.  Anything less would not be freedom but
<br>
coercion to keep political speechs free from reference to religious symbols,
<br>
words, ethical systems(?) and so on.  That would not be an improvement.
