<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Please humor me and my ignorance of the details involved, I will ask a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of questions in trying to understand the situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Actually, the immigration of all those mexican peasants does indeed matter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to us all, especially those of us who are planning to be frozen if old age 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;aint cured pretty soon.  The substantial MAJORITY of immigrants, mexicans or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;otherwise, are &quot;peasants.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I would expect a majority, but is it SO marked? I'd expected a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;poor urban dwellers with low-skill job abilities would be a big component
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of immigration.
</em><br>
<p>Most come from two rural provinces in Mexico. Many also come from
<br>
other countries in latin america,  But it doesn't matter if they come
<br>
from the country or the city, or some other country.  MOSTLY, they are
<br>
uneducated peasants, and they bring an uneducated peasant culture with
<br>
them and an uneducated, superstitious peasant brain with them..
<br>
Cultures are real; cultures differ; some culture offer this, other
<br>
cultures offer that.  Often, unsurprisingly, &quot;this&quot; is better than
<br>
&quot;that&quot;.
<br>
<p>Say I am cruel or harsh or whatever, but there are choices to be made,
<br>
and in order to do so intelligently, one must engage the facts.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; They are probably more aware of the potential benefits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going to the US than a peasant, or so I would imagine in my ignorance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and extrapolating from what I've seen in the emigration patterns of Argentina
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and neighbouring countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; From my observations, peasants don't run much of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;a country. Mainly, they live in kleptocracies. I don't want the USA to be a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;kleptocracy. I doubt cryonics would be legal for the common man in the USA 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;were uneducated peasants to abound in the USA.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, they live in kleptocracies. But they suffer the abuses, instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;benefitting from them. Given that, I can't imagine why would they feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inclined to create a kleptocracy in the US. They may lack a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sophisticated political ideas and practice, but they should be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recognize kleptocracy is a no win game for them. Were they benefitting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from it, wouldn't they just stay in their countries? 
</em><br>
<p><p>As Lee pointed out, it would not be intended, but would be simply a
<br>
consequence.
<br>
<p>I am rather well acquainted with the particulars of the problem we are
<br>
discussing, BTW. I live in Texas in a location with a very high influx
<br>
of immigrants from mexico, and I grew up along the mexican border. In
<br>
fact, in the past, the family business (a sheep ranch) bordered
<br>
Mexico, and we have ranched in mexico itself.  I speak some spanish,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, how would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the uneducated peasants keep you from enjoying cryonics? I thought those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of them that are illegals wouldn't be able to vote or such, and those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who can, well I just can't see them worrying much about the issue one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way or another...
</em><br>
<p>Like all peasants, they have lots of kids, and once here in the USA,
<br>
often become citizens. They raise their kids, and pass their cultures
<br>
onto their kids.  Then we have a whole lot of uneducated,
<br>
superstitious peasants. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;You may say education is compulsory in the USA, but please see my
<br>
posts re education previous to this, plus sending someone to school
<br>
does not erase the culture passed onto them by their parents.  It
<br>
takes generations to change cultures. And some immigrant cultures
<br>
change more willingly and rapidly than others.  I don't have the time
<br>
to go into all the details of the particular case right now....perhaps
<br>
others will do so........
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Do you think states in the USA would have allowed cryonics 200 years
<br>
ago, when dinosaurs, err, peasants, ruled the land? Quite possibly
<br>
not.  But that is where we are headed here in the USA. 
<br>
There are many, many aspects of the problem, and I have only touched
<br>
upon those that concern me as a cryonicist.  There are of course
<br>
advantages to immigration for all US citizens. But advantages must be
<br>
weighed against disadvantages.  As a cryonicist, those things I have
<br>
spoken of are showstoppers.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;Another thing, no one really invited them, except those that make money from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;them, and that is really the minority in the USA. YOu say my own ancestors 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;were immigrants, too? That is a non sequitir: I may own a house, and at some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;point in the past, I did not own that house. Does that make it OK for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;someone else to move in without my permission?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Fair enough, it should be your call to keep them out. All I have to say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though, is that considering the way things are going in Mexico and Central
</em><br>
<em>&gt;America, you better be prepared to build a really expensive and complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt;border barrier system. I can imagine this might hurt your commerce, though.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It will probably require you to get quite violent about enforcing things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and I would imagine that is going to have all kinds of consequences.
</em><br>
<p>This country is our business, a commercial enterprise, a location
<br>
where we citizens make our livings. We are all partners in this
<br>
business, and we should run it as such.  We also sleep above the
<br>
store, so to speak, so there are other concerns, e.g., environmental,
<br>
to bear in mind.  However, any good business maintains controls and
<br>
procedures in order to control the money and other assets.
<br>
Accountants are examples of such controls.  A business  may use  a
<br>
safe, or even control its funds by placing them in a large, guarded
<br>
facility called a bank.  Men with guns may guard these funds.
<br>
Furthermore, a business may employ other security measures: men with
<br>
guns may patrol the premises of the business.  In order to maintain
<br>
control of the premises and business funds, electronic security
<br>
measures, such as smart cards, etc., may be employed. All these
<br>
methods are in the arsenal of the business. We, the owners of the USA,
<br>
may well employ such methods in the securing of our own assets.
<br>
<p>Also, regarding the immigration of educated software professionals,
<br>
i.e., HIB's, I myself work with many H1Bs, albeit often remotely via
<br>
phone and email etc., so in some way, my own living derives from them.
<br>
But I recognize that American citizens would take those jobs were
<br>
there no H1Bs.
