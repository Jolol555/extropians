<p>Firstly, you're personalizing a nation of millions. Don't do that. For
<br>
all you know, the average guy on the streets of Kingston is just as
<br>
opposed to the taking out of such loans as you are. (Do I need to read
<br>
you the standard libertarian &quot;the state is not the same as the sum of
<br>
its citizens&quot; speech at this point?)
<br>
<p>Secondly, there may well be circumstances which force current politicians
<br>
there to take out such loans, even against their better judgement. Such
<br>
as, say, the need to service interest payments on previous loans taken
<br>
out by previous governments. (In other words, it's elephants all the
<br>
way down -- at least, to the point where nobody now alive deserves to
<br>
be saddled with the blame for a bad decision.) Yes, taking these loans
<br>
is a dumb idea, in the absence of other conditions. For all we know,
<br>
there may well be conditions that make _not_ taking the loans an even
<br>
worse option in the short term.
<br>
<p>Thirdly -- and this is the most important point -- conditions attached to
<br>
the loans are being used as instruments of state power. That is the
<br>
real bad problem here; the recipient of the loan isn't free to use it 
<br>
productively. 
<br>
<p>If I hold a metaphorical gun to your head and say &quot;here's ten thousand
<br>
dollars -- you must repay me at 19% interest within ten years or come
<br>
back for another loan to service the interest payments, and you're not
<br>
only allowed but required to spend this loan on heroin,&quot; you wouldn't
<br>
thank me, would you? Seems to me that this, in human terms, is pretty
<br>
much exactly what the IMF is doing.
