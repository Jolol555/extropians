<p><em>&gt; Why? If the statistics support it, then it is an entirely valid

</em><br>
<p>I know this is a hard point to grasp, but it is basic statistics.
<br>
Statistical numbers only apply to large normalized groups.  They do not
<br>
apply to individuals or small groups.  A million coin flips will be 50%
<br>
heads and 50% tails.  We cannot pre-judge a single coin flip, or even a few
<br>
coin flips.  The statistical numbers do not apply.  They cannot support any
<br>
assumptions made about any individual.
<br>
<p>Your weather man predicts percentages of rain of an area based on
<br>
statistical averages for that area.  (Even then, weather reports are not
<br>
that accurate!)  He does not predict for a particular house or person
<br>
whether they will get rain.  He does not predict for a particular cloud
<br>
whether it will rain or not.
<br>
<p>Applying group sampling statistics to the group being sampled is valid.
<br>
Applying group sampling statistics to any individual is not valid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Is there any good reason to split hairs with these terms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to practice prejudice and discrimination while claiming not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be racist?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, there is. If you were following my essays on trust and political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enfranchisement here in the US, you'd recognize why. I most emphatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do NOT say that the probability of committing crime is genetic. To the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contrary, it is part and parcel of the trust dynamic in society. Those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we trust least are more likely to breach trust. Part of it is a self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fulfilling prophesy of expectations about the behavior of those we trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least, the rest is generally a self perpetuating attitude of resentment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in those who are poorly trusted.
</em><br>
<p>So how does this relate to race?  Are you saying that one race should be
<br>
trusted more or less than another race?  If so, this is racist.  You might
<br>
believe it is scientifically justified by the facts, but it is a belief
<br>
systems that non-physical characteristics can be determined by observing a
<br>
person's skin color.  Prejudice is based on this belief, in that you can
<br>
judge a person by race instead of by their individual merit.  Discrimination
<br>
is based on this prejudice, in that you can make decisions based on a
<br>
person's race instead of their individual merit.  If you believe you can or
<br>
should prejudge and make decisions based on someone's race even without
<br>
evaluating them individually, this is racism.  Even if it is scientifically
<br>
proven to be a good and accurate way to judge people, the concept of judging
<br>
people by their race is called racism.  We don't seem to be disagreeing on
<br>
what you are describing, we just disagree on what label to put to it.
