With mild sarcasm, I had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Here is an essay written in August concerning reparations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I don't know anything about &quot;The American Enterprise Online&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; web site, and so don't know if arguments written by people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; affilitated with it should be dismissed out of hand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.theamericanenterprise.org/taeja01a.htm">http://www.theamericanenterprise.org/taeja01a.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p>---sarcasm which may have escaped many of the gentle readers of
<br>
the extropians list.  Naturally, I do *not* believe that arguments
<br>
should ever be dismissed out of hand because of who wrote them
<br>
or where they are from.
<br>
<p>But my sarcasm did not escape Harvey Newstrom, for whom, I'll
<br>
confess, it was intended.  After chiding me for being lazy
<br>
and for &quot;not wanting to know&quot;, he goes on to say
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't know why you think a source is reliable enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quote if you don't know anything about them.
</em><br>
<p>I will naturally feel free to quote anything that makes sense to
<br>
me, regardless of its source.  I can hardly believe that this
<br>
discussion is necessary on this list.
<br>
<p>Content determines everything, of course.  What is said is vastly
<br>
more important than who says it.  Exceptions to this are when one
<br>
feels uncertain about the validity of technical information, and
<br>
one naturally undertakes to determine whether the factual information
<br>
is from a credible source.  But it is rather frightening to hear
<br>
anyone backing up a claim that in rigorous debate we should pay
<br>
attention only to the proper &quot;credentialed&quot; authorities.  (I don't
<br>
know that Harvey Newstrom actually goes so far; but it's hard to
<br>
know what to think when he defends the practice of first determining
<br>
who said something, and where they are from, before listening to
<br>
what they say.)
<br>
<p>A good example of this came up last year on sci.physics.relativity.
<br>
I was arguing that the &quot;frozen star&quot; concept makes more sense than
<br>
it's commonly credited with, and that we don't really have much of
<br>
a physical basis for saying that anything occurs on the other side
<br>
of an event horizon; it's possible that the entire star simply 
<br>
remains frozen.  Then, many trillions of years later, it just 
<br>
gradually evaporates in the process that Hawking has described.
<br>
Well, a few of the very good physicists began to debate the
<br>
proposition with me, and I was doing quite well when one of
<br>
them became exasperated and asked me just who I was and what my
<br>
credentials were.  I ignored that, and continued the debate.  It
<br>
died away after a notable European physicist chimed in and wrote
<br>
&quot;That the black hole evaporates completely before even forming a
<br>
horizon is not crackpot nonsense, but a scenario proposed by
<br>
Gerlach, PRD 14(6), 1976.&quot;   But on the whole, only a *tiny*
<br>
reference had been made to the fact that I was not a recognized
<br>
physicist---which is exactly the way that it should be.
<br>
<p>When we are examining the content of something, it simply should
<br>
not matter who said it.  Such &quot;argument from authority&quot; has been
<br>
discredited, at least in the circles where I hang out, practically
<br>
forever.
<br>
