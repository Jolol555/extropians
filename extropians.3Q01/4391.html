Thanks for all the excellent suggestions - I knew this list would be the
<br>
best free-form brainstorm I could come up with.
<br>
<p>One of the episodes of &quot;The Sci-fi Files&quot; has a rather good Science in SF
<br>
topic, plus I have it on vid
<br>
<p>Some interesting connections :
<br>
<p>There were a few that I thought of today at work which you folks also came
<br>
up with, like 12 Monkeys and Brazil (excellent nightmarish futures of
<br>
mindless overwhelming bureaucracies, plus a way of indoctrinating the
<br>
kiddies to Terry G). I've also thought of forcing them to read &quot;A Sound of
<br>
Thunder&quot; (getting them to read is like extracting teeth) as a combination
<br>
&quot;butterfly effect&quot; (fnarr) and time travel paradox.
<br>
<p>Most coincidentally, after Gordon mentioned Dr Who, the best episode I
<br>
thought of was Pyramids of Mars, which several folks have independently
<br>
arrived at
<br>
<p>I'm also thinking of surreptitiously slipping some forteana in there, with
<br>
a lesson on UFOs in the making contact section, and maybe a touch on the
<br>
Ancient Astronauts and the face on Mars. I've already got my junior
<br>
students tracking down some eye-witnesses to the Cloncurry fish falls
<br>
<p>My biggest enemy is time (I have 12 x 70 minutes lessons to fit it into),
<br>
so most of the video stimulus material will probably find its way onto an
<br>
edited tape - specific scenes like Jump Gates from B5 (nice little red
<br>
shift/blue shift thing) along with the nicely designed Starfuries and the
<br>
Earth Alliance warships with the rotating artificial gravity sections,
<br>
Klaatu's arrival in TDTESS (as compared to the dove scene in Mars Attacks,
<br>
the opening shots from Blade Runner, something from Forbidden planet with
<br>
Robby the Robot (if just to show them a serious Lesley Neilsen), etc. Using
<br>
short cuts should avoid any problems with censorship ratings as well.
<br>
<p>And yes, while I toyed with the idea of Bicentennial Man for about a
<br>
microsecond (only because it's a recent flick), my common sense quickly got
<br>
the better of me
<br>
<p>thanks again - I may post my unit plan and assessment items once I get them
<br>
written
<br>

<br>
