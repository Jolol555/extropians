<P>Hello all, </P>
<P>I&nbsp; just wanted to remind people who said that they'd like to help in my work (on cyborgs, transhumans and posthumans) that I will be sending a questionnaire-type thing to them&nbsp;to look at this week. If you are still willing to help as an informant or commentator on my research, could you please get back to me to say so. If you've changed your mind, can you also e-mail me so I can start filtering mail from the extropians mailing list.</P>
<P>Thanks a lot,</P>

<p><strong>attached mail follows:</strong><hr noshade><DIV><FONT face=GulimChe>Hi everybody, <BR><BR>My name's Helen, and I've just joined the extropy list. <BR>I'd like to ask a favour: I'm currently in the process of looking for <BR>informants to help me in my MA dissertation. I'm studying Sociology at the <BR>University of Reading in England, and would really like to speak to people <BR>who see themselves, or would refer to themselves as cyborgs. My MA will be <BR>looking at the issues of cyborgs and identity, and how the 'cyborg' term has <BR>been approriated by both real cyborgs - in a literal sense, and by non-real <BR>cyborgs - in a metaphorical sense. I'm particularily interested in people <BR>who have been technologically modified e.g. prosthetics, implants, and so <BR>on. and people who are actively seeking to modify themselves through <BR>technology. <BR>If you're interested in helping, or even if you just want to comment on my <BR>proposal, please reply ASAP. <BR><BR>P.S. If you don't use the term cyborg, but !
see yourselves as a posthuman or <BR>transhuman, I'd also be interested in speaking/corresponding with you <BR><BR>Thanks for reading this. <BR><BR>Helen </FONT><BR></DIV>
