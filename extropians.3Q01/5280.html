It is interesting to note that the journal Nature has a section for art
<br>
in science / science in art. I wonder how many art journals have that?
<br>
<p>The renaissance involved trying to create something new that unified the
<br>
old knowledge with the new scientific/economic/artistic discoveries, and
<br>
then change society accordingly (although this later part only really
<br>
got underway during the enlightenment). I see many similarities with
<br>
today: we need a new renaissance to unify the old knowledge with the new
<br>
discoveries and then find ways of changing our societies accordingly. 
<br>
<p>The fact that there are people trying to bridge the two cultures and
<br>
create a new synthesis isn't enough, as long as they stand fairly alone
<br>
and unsupported. What made the daring transdisciplinary work of the
<br>
renaissance so important was that it took place in a cultural context
<br>
where it gained support and influence - the actual number of humanists,
<br>
scientists, artists and engineers were fairly low, but they affected
<br>
society profoundly through various channels. Had these channels not
<br>
stood open, their effect would have been marginal and the renaissance
<br>
soon forgotten. We need to find the modern counterparts of these
<br>
channels of reaching into society and for creating a cultural context
<br>
that promotes synthesis.
