<em>&gt;   Alright. Since the thread doesn't seem to be going away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It's a statistical fact that the mean for persons who identify as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; African-American on most (arguably virtually all) standardized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tests are aproximately one standard deviation below those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mean of those who identify as white. Similarly East Asians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Chinese, Koreans, Japanese) tend to do slightly better than white.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everyone who has looked into this knows who is at the top of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the standardized test heap :) The reasons for this are factually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obscure. We don't know &quot;why&quot; this is so..but statistically it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is remarkably sure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    This &quot;discrepancy&quot; in test scores persists even after adjustment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for social status and parental income etc. Look at the mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of middle class Black kids vs. mean middle class white kids.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aproximately one standard deviation. Like clockwork.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   For those who are in the extremely high percentiles on tests like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the SATs or GREs or the like and are white it is unlikely affirmative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action will negatively affect their collegiate admissions opportunities.
</em><br>
<p>You erroneously assume that a person who is admitted to a college can
<br>
afford to go there. Being admitted and being able to pay for it are two
<br>
entirely different things. Another thing that financial aid offices
<br>
generally do NOT account for is the impact of the number of children in
<br>
a family on income, and thus is weighted toward families with few kids.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Individuals who are marginal or borderline candidates for admissions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are the ones who are most affected by affirmative action. The number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of seats in a given class is limited. The ethnic admissions generally tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to bump off marginal (white) candidates.
</em><br>
<p>Except, of course, in the case of geography. If an admissions department
<br>
has a policy against having too many students from the same geographic
<br>
area, then even highly ranked white candidates will get bumped, because
<br>
rural areas, covering more square miles, are generally more populated by
<br>
whites. Geographic restrictions abound in college admissions.
<br>
<p>In my case, I live 4 miles down the road from Dartmouth College. It is
<br>
historical fact that Dartmouth never accepts more than one student from
<br>
my high school in any given year, no matter how highly ranked applicants
<br>
are, and generally the top 20% of the class always applies to Dartmouth,
<br>
so its rather evident that the admissions rate to applicant pool of
<br>
applicants from our high school is biased by a factor of more than two
<br>
to one versus the nationwide Dartmouth applicant pool. In no instance I
<br>
am aware of has any Lebanon High School student recieved financial aid
<br>
to attend Dartmouth.
<br>
<p>Now, I've detailed how geographic discrmination like this can result in
<br>
racial discrimination. I don't generally consider this, myself, to be
<br>
'intentional'. However, the sociology and political science people at
<br>
Dartmouth are the major proponents claiming that this sort of behavior
<br>
IS racism, at least when it is practiced against blacks, yet they
<br>
practice it themselves against whites in their own admissions policies.
