What do you think the IMF and the Word Bank are, Mike? They're not banks
<br>
in the conventional sense of a bank that you or I might walk into and ask
<br>
for a loan. They're international agencies backed by governments, whose
<br>
job is to spread the risk of providing financial assistance to other
<br>
governments, when it has been determined for political reasons that such
<br>
assistance should be rendered. They are, fundamentally, tools for
<br>
implementing the international relations policies of the governments that 
<br>
back them. They're not free agents in the economic sphere!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The 19% rate is simply a disinscentive against borrowing for such a dumb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purpose.
</em><br>
<p>Nah. 19% interest rates are _low_ by the standards of British credit card
<br>
accounts. You think the credit card bureaus are trying to discourage users
<br>
from borrowing at those rates? 19%, from another angle, is a rate designed
<br>
to give a decent profit to the lender, when there's some risk that the
<br>
borrower will go bust. Yes, it's a disincentive against borrowing -- but
<br>
if the belt-tightening alternative goes hand in glove with a revolution
<br>
and blood in the streets, what are you going to do?
<br>
<p>What interests me is that a 19% interest rate -- in what is basically a
<br>
repayable loan from one government to another -- looks like a hook with a
<br>
barb on it. There's *no* *way* that a recipient government can boost their
<br>
economic growth, on the basis of a loan, sufficiently to repay at 19% per
<br>
annum. 
<br>
<p>(The fundamental difference between the way you're thinking about it, and
<br>
the way I'm thinking about it, is that you're thinking in terms of a pure
<br>
free market system, with transactions between individuals who are rational
<br>
and free. I'm thinking in terms of the US State Department and the UK Foreign
<br>
Office lurking up a dark alleyway and mugging some poor bastard who can't
<br>
fight back, in order to cut the price of bananas.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:
<br>
<em>&gt; Whether it's turtles all the way down or not is irrelevant. Keep in mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not too sympathetic toward the IMF either, but at least they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starting to get their act together. There are plenty of measures that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country like Jamaica can take to pull itself out of the hole by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bootstraps. For example, they can drastically revise their banking and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxation laws to encourage an influx of deposits from overseas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investors, and structure their social welfare programs to encourage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to obtain long term birth controls like Norplant.
</em><br>
<p>To encourage an influx of deposits from overseas investors, you need to
<br>
be able to offer something to invest _in_. Last time I looked down at the
<br>
supermarket, bananas were cheaper than potatoes. (When I was a wee kid
<br>
they were a luxury fruit!) That implies that if you put yourself in the
<br>
saddle of the Jamaican government, you need to re-tool the economy to do
<br>
something profitable. But you need to do so on a budget of approximately
<br>
fifty cents, because you've got nothing to work with -- no skilled workers,
<br>
no infrastructure, no high-level education system, and nothing but bananas.
<br>
<p>The Jamaican birth rate isn't a major problem; at 18.51/1000 population
<br>
(in 1999) it's higher than the US (at 14.2/1000), but much lower than most
<br>
of the third world; just about everywhere in Africa and the Middle East
<br>
is in the 35-45 range, for example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I understand completely that being in a situation where you have a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; percent of the population who are unskilled, unemployable, and unwilling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fix that, you have a major mess on your hands, one that requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either war, famine, epidemic, or other natural disaster to fix.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
That's arrant nonsense. For starters, you can make just about 80% of any
<br>
population willing to learn if you can give them a positive incentive for
<br>
change. For seconds, you're embracing a negativistic fatalism about the
<br>
human condition that is, dare I say it, rather at odds with extropianism.
<br>
<p>If we judge Europe in the 12th century by your yardstick of &quot;unskilled,
<br>
unemployable, and unwilling to fix that&quot; then it comes off a hell of a lot
<br>
worse than Jamaica today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The purpose of the 19% loan is to send a price signal to the rulers that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they can no longer fix today's problems by borrowing from the future.
</em><br>
<p>Nope, the purpose of the 19% loan is to send a diplomatic signal to the
<br>
rulers saying &quot;we've got you where we want you, now lube up and bend
<br>
over&quot;. The 19% interest rate wasn't dictated for commercial reasons, but
<br>
for political ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Thirdly -- and this is the most important point -- conditions attached to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the loans are being used as instruments of state power. That is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; real bad problem here; the recipient of the loan isn't free to use it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; productively.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, they are not free to spend it on social welfare programs. There is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing wrong with a person to attach stipulations on how THEIR money is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to be used by those they lend it to. A bank would get mighty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pissed if I took out an auto loan and used the money on a vacation to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fiji.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Social welfare programs include building schools and training workers
<br>
in new skills. (What was that you said about &quot;unskilled, unemployable,
<br>
and unwilling to fix that&quot;?)
<br>
<p>The aid donor nations have no interest in encouraging third world
<br>
countries to develop their economies. That's because the current world
<br>
trade system -- which we, as first world residents, benefit from --
<br>
evolved organically from the preceding imperialist system. Under the
<br>
imperial system, an imperial state (say, the UK in the 19th century)
<br>
would produce finished high-tech goods and export them to its client
<br>
states; in return, they'd send in all their low-tech raw materials and
<br>
foodstuffs. _That_ system required the imperial state to keep the rabble
<br>
in line with gunboats and governors; the current system is what emerged
<br>
when the gunboats and governors were withdrawn. Nobody wants to lose
<br>
their export markets for high-tech goods and their cheap sources of raw
<br>
materials, so they rig the game so that the former colonies can't easily
<br>
divert resources to development. Meanwhile, those former colonies --
<br>
being underdeveloped -- are highly vulnerable to crop failure and famine;
<br>
under the imperial system the rulers would usually make at least a token
<br>
gesture to divert resources from elsewhere in the empire, but under the
<br>
new system they can get the IMF to offer a loan to offset the effects. A
<br>
loan which has terms which, not coincidentally, prop up the existing
<br>
inequities in the system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the point of view of the former colonial powers, this is really great;
</em><br>
it's got all the advantages of running an empire, without the
<br>
inconvenient overheads of having to go out there and rule surly natives
<br>
at gunpoint. (The USA has, since 1945, bought heavily into this system,
<br>
taking on a lot of the role that was formerly occupied by the European
<br>
imperial powers. And you wonder why anti-Americanism is so widespread
<br>
in the third world?)
<br>
<p>We _know_ that third world countries can develop. Look at South Korea or
<br>
Vietnam circa 1945, and look at South Korea today. Look at Thailand. Or
<br>
China, today, in the throes of routine 7% annual growth.  Hell, even
<br>
Poland or the Czech republic fit the mold to some extent (at least in
<br>
comparison to Russia).  The question we should be asking is why places 
<br>
like Jamaica or Zambia don't follow suit. I don't buy the argument that
<br>
the locals are too stupid or lazy to work; hacking bananas off trees for
<br>
piece-rate on a plantation isn't a cushy life. 
<br>
<p>Clue: extropians are concerned with human development. Mostly we look at
<br>
the limitless vistas of the future. But once in a while it's a good idea
<br>
to look at the opportunities for human development that surround us, right
<br>
here and now.
