</em><br>
<p>So long as observational evidence supports the idea, as it did, does,
<br>
and continues to do, then questioning it is simply part of the process
<br>
of observation. This is not, however, what subjectivists do. They
<br>
instead proclaim that science does not form a successive approximation
<br>
to truth, that it is simply trading one dead horse for another according
<br>
to the practitioners prejudices. They don't 'question' anything, because
<br>
they are wed to their theology of subjectivism and only see what they
<br>
believe, not the other way around.
