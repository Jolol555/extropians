Russell: Thanks for the background on Kass.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
The classical liberal ideal usually is expressed as two parts, (1) the idea
<br>
that the state ought to remain morally neutral in matters of morality (and
<br>
the pursuit of our own individual conception of human flourishing) and (2)
<br>
so long as the individual does not, in Mill's words, &quot;make himself a
<br>
nuisance to other people&quot; and &quot;short of injury to others&quot;. (Chapter 3 On
<br>
Liberty). I know you are aware of this, but I wonder if Kass makes any
<br>
arguments that invoke the second clause. Kass aside, do you see the coming
<br>
debate focused on 1 or 2? (If I were against transhumanism I think I would
<br>
work on 2, after all, many of us are all too cognizant of the potential for
<br>
unintended consequence of technologies, for example, black goo and
<br>
unfriendly AI etc.)
