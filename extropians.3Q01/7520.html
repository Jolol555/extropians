<p>I think you can even listen to them, understand their point of view,
<br>
recognize that you would act the same at their place, and still fight
<br>
and defeat them.
<br>
<p>I was surprised to see that bin Laden is consistently said to be &quot;a
<br>
coward&quot;, that islamists are said to be &quot;mad&quot;, etc. It may be natural or
<br>
useful, but the truth value of it seem very low to me.
<br>
<p>I think their are neither cowards nor mad. But that they are our ennemy.
<br>
<p>You don't need your ennemy to be morally despicable or mentally ill to
<br>
fight against him.
<br>
<p>It's a question of interests, we should not be ashamed of this. We want
<br>
to preserve something (which include ourselves, and the way we want to
<br>
live) that they want to change/destroy.
<br>
<p>Here in France people seem unable to think that way, they reflect like
<br>
they are gods, watching the humans from nowhere, and relativizing their
<br>
own views in a pathological way. I hope you (US) are not. People, we
<br>
need you to stay strong !! :-)
