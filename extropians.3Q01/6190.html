<em>&gt; In light of the day's cascading atrocities, I feel pretty much the way the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of the posters to this list feel --both repulsed and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vengeful.  However, after watching the (CNN) coverage from the morning
</em><br>
slip
<br>
<em>&gt; in to the coverage of the afternoon, I started to notice more and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reporters and interviewees start to criticize the government for either
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; having enough intelligence or not making the &quot;right&quot; decisions etc.  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starting to see that on this list as well.
</em><br>
<p>Let me add to that.  If the CIA knew and didn't act, it's incompetent and
<br>
near useless.  If it's just making up information after the fact, then it's
<br>
lying to the World.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am a libertarian, and I generally don't care for governmental intrusion;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, I most unabashedly think that regardless of anyone's politics,
</em><br>
now
<br>
<em>&gt; is the time to be unified behind the US government.  I know and accept
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; regardless of what action the United States will take against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perpetrators and the harboring country/countries, there will be immense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticisms from a multitude of groups.  But I don't think now is the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make those criticisms.  Having lived in Canada for most of my life, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; USA for some, I have had the opportunity to muse upon what country I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather have in a situation like this, and USA wins hand down.  Though the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more mundane day-to-day aspects of the government deserve criticism, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think such criticism is possibly justified when it comes to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues of security, military or the overwhelming sense of national pride
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America possesses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I live in Canada again now, but as soon as I heard the news early this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morning, I desperately wished I was in the USA.  It may have its flaws,
</em><br>
but
<br>
<em>&gt; it is undeniably the most proud, independent and action-based country in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this world...and that deserves no criticism.
</em><br>
<p>One question:  is it that way because of its government or in spite of it?
<br>
I think it's the good aspects of American culture you should be praising and
<br>
not its government.
<br>
<p>I fear that the &quot;crisis and leviathan&quot; theme will now play itself out and
<br>
government power will expand using the current crisis as a pretext.  I'm
<br>
surprised you don't see this.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
