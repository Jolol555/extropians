<p>Actually if you gave them fresh water they might let you

do it for nothing.  By that time they will have drained

the Sea of Aral dry.

<p>Not so fast spike.  The editorial lead-in for the June 22 2001 issue
<br>
of Science &quot;Genetic Engineering and Water&quot; is quite provocative.
<br>
Some facts:
<br>
&nbsp;- world population increases by 2.5 billion (~40%) by 2025
<br>
&nbsp;- annual cereal yield increases are declining
<br>
&nbsp;- of the water available for agriculture 70% is already in use
<br>
&nbsp;- 50% of the world's wetlands have disappeared
<br>
&nbsp;- 40% of the world's food is produced from irrigated land
<br>
&nbsp;- 10% of the world's food is produced from water mined from aquifers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(many of which are being mined unsustainably)
<br>
&nbsp;- 1 lb of cotton requires 17,000 lbs of water
<br>
&nbsp;- 1 lb of rice requires 4,700 lbs of water
<br>
&nbsp;- 40% of plant productivity in Africa and Asia and 20% in the developed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world is lost to pests and pathogens, 1/3 to viruses, fungi and bacteria
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and 2/3 to insects and nematodes.
<br>
<p>If you combine the population increases driving food demaind with the
<br>
probability that we will probably have to start migrating our energy
<br>
production to solar-electric or solar-methane (or H2) for sustainability
<br>
then I would predict the demand for land is going to remain fairly high.
<br>
<p>GM will help a lot but I wouldn't label it a sure thing until people
<br>
actually sit down and run the numbers looking at where we are now
<br>
and how close we can get to the theoretical limits.
<br>
<p>There are other solutions (breeder reactors, solar power satellites,
<br>
etc.) but those may have to wait for the Nano-santa to make them
<br>
viable candidates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Agreed.  There are a lot of countries which would likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kick in some gold to buy land from the commies for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; water storage purposes.  Seems like a far cheaper solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than reducing CO2 emissions.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Ahhhemm.... spike, with the exception of China, in the countries
<br>
mentioned most of the people aren't &quot;commies&quot; any more.
<br>
<p>For an optimal situation I think you actually want to increase CO2 emissions
<br>
right up to the point where very advanced biotech or nanotech can
<br>
reverse it.  The more carbon you put into the atmosphere the greater
<br>
the &quot;sunk cost&quot; benefit you have during the nanotech transition.
<br>
There is a negative side to this (more people will likely die in
<br>
the pre-transition period due to storms, floods, etc.)  However
<br>
the plus side is that more people are likely to be saved by cheap
<br>
carbon from the commons once nano-minting becomes feasible.
<br>
(There is an assumption here that removal of carbon from the
<br>
atmosphere isn't &quot;immediately&quot; taxed or regulated by governments.)
<br>
<p>There are probably several PhD theses of work to be done in
<br>
designing simulations for this so that one could analyze
<br>
various tradeoffs (maximization of # of people saved, minimization
<br>
of total years of potential life lost, maximization of economic
<br>
growth, etc.) that Robin could put graduate students to work on.
