<p><em>&gt; It isn't the classification  of our ideas that I was saying

</em><br>
<em>&gt; (almost) as much as you want, without running into the problem...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you use the term &quot;eugenics&quot; to label anything you espouse,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you will immediately lose a significant part of your audience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you feel the term is more important than the audience, then I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't try to keep you from using it.
</em><br>
<p>Historical accuracy, plain speaking and meaning, all be damned.
<br>
You are, of course, absolutely right.  For every person who has
<br>
ever heard of Francis Galton, or who has ever dispassionately
<br>
considered the influence of genes on people's personalities and
<br>
intelligence, there are a thousand knee-jerk simpletons.  Not
<br>
only that, but people like me who don't care much what the
<br>
simpletons are thinking appear *ourselves* to be idiots because
<br>
we appear not to know that the use of such a term is suicidal---
<br>
and in that sense, it even becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.
<br>
<p>It reminds me of what happened to &quot;sociobiology&quot;.  Edward O. Wilson
<br>
had created so much animosity among leftists that the mere mention
<br>
of that word derailed thinking for at least a decade after he first
<br>
coined the term.  Yes... blah blah blah it meant Nazis, genocide,
<br>
crypto-royalist politics, etc., etc.   (Of course the researchers
<br>
themselves continued to make discoveries in sociobiology.)  So a
<br>
new term actually *had* to be invented to placate the mindless
<br>
and the hopelessly partisan.  That term turned out to be
<br>
&quot;evolutionary psychology&quot;.
<br>
<p>So since the mindless *always* win these fights, who can suggest
<br>
a good two-word phrase for a voluntary movement of people who
<br>
favor obtaining for their children the best natural sperm or eggs
<br>
that they can?
