<p><em>&gt; You want to turn hackers into spies or what?  I am sure that any

</em><br>
<em>&gt; be up to something like this would come forward with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information.
</em><br>
<p>The information might well have been out there, on the net someplace. If
<br>
it was super-obvious, I'm sure folks would speak up. (Maybe some did,
<br>
who knows?). I don't think more subtle cues would have alerted anyone,
<br>
but maybe some sort of 'homeland defense' training would help here.
<br>
<p>Maybe they don't need to become spies. Maybe they could just program and
<br>
run simulations. I'm not sure in the following that I will be able to
<br>
get my point across, but what I think we need is not just outside the
<br>
box thinking but out-of-left-field thinking.
<br>
<p>This idea is what preoccupies my thoughts on 'fighting the system' when
<br>
it comes to various oppressive laws. I think it's becoming impossible.
<br>
People will say, give money to the EFF to help oppose the DMCA and free
<br>
Skylarov. And some folks will give money, and I think that's a generally
<br>
a good idea. But I think there's a feeling that once you do that, you've
<br>
done your part. Your issues with the DMCA or SSSCA or whatever is
<br>
'resolved', at least in certain short-term ways.
<br>
<p>I read years ago that the CIA had funded some left-wing organizations
<br>
that, for example, supported the people of El Salvador. The purpose
<br>
being to have people feel that they helped somehow if they gave money to
<br>
such organizations. This might 'resolve' the issues for these people;
<br>
they did something, and now can go on with their lives even as the
<br>
repression in that country continued.
<br>
<p>So I conclude that there is *nothing you can do* (within the context of
<br>
the system as generally presented and defined). Writing your congressman
<br>
impassioned pleas for civil liberties may have no effect whatsoever on
<br>
someone who is just in office to maximize wealth and power, and getting
<br>
big contributions from the MPAA.
<br>
<p>I used to play a lot of historical strategy boardgames, and recall
<br>
reading some article about how people who didn't know the history
<br>
presented in the game often made better beta-testers. Those who knew
<br>
their history played the game in the 'proper' way. Those who didn't know
<br>
the history played the game system instead, maximizing what it offered
<br>
w/o regard to what happened historically. (One example I recall was a
<br>
Milton Bradley game on Roman conquests: building armies of catapults
<br>
exclusively was a winning strategy). Computer games featuring online
<br>
multiplayer gaming unleash a great deal of talent applied to maximizing
<br>
the system w/o regard to how the game designers intended it to be
<br>
played. Strategies for computer RPG's suggest 'dont roleplay', i.e.,
<br>
dont get caught up in your character or the gameworld ambiance if you
<br>
want to maximize your win.
<br>
<p>US intelligence services no doubt have thinking-outside-the-box
<br>
training. But I can see how they can still be too close to it. Having
<br>
hackers hack the 'system' of terrorism might well come up with ideas
<br>
that wouldn't occur to intelligence agencies. Perhaps it's also a matter
<br>
of just good taste. Remember all those Challenger jokes? Do you think
<br>
these were passed around at NASA to generate laughs? A computer game in
<br>
which you play a terrorist using commercial airliners as cruise missiles
<br>
sounds utterly tasteless and offensive but there seems a possibilty that
<br>
some insight might be gained from playing such a thing. Or play the
<br>
other side and do the cost/benefit analysis of giving bin Laden a few
<br>
cruise missiles, so terrorists wouldn't need to use airplanes as such.
<br>
<p>I remember a game called Ultimatum. The idea was US vs Soviet Union
<br>
power struggles in a worldwide setting, but the main part of the
<br>
gameboard was maps of the US and SU, and counters for missiles, bombers,
<br>
etc, and lots, lots, of cool nuclear explosion markers. Imagine such a
<br>
system for the real world: you visit the strategic command center, and
<br>
off to the side there's a bunch of bored folks running Excel
<br>
spreadsheets and printing out maps, then they turn on the nuclear war
<br>
fighting system and it's some supercool holographic display of the
<br>
entire planet with little glowing missile and bomber icons. The
<br>
Ultimatum game encouraged nuclear war just by having that be the focus
<br>
of the game's presentation: it was cool to have one. This may not be a
<br>
super relevent example but I would think there are 'systems' in use in
<br>
intelligence agencies that support a focus on certain types of thinking
<br>
as opposed to others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But in general I don't see a tighter relationship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with authority, much of which wishes to suppress us and is used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for that purpose big-time, as being a good thing.
</em><br>
<p>Half the time I would agree. The other half of the time I think we're
<br>
approaching -- or in -- the type of world in which some of the more
<br>
horrific news headlines in novels such as Halperin's _The Truth Machine_
<br>
and _The First Immortal_ are quite plausible. A world where small groups
<br>
of people or even individuals will be able to cause immense amounts of
<br>
damage and/or loss of life. I can often see perfectly valid reasons for
<br>
a survelliance state. I could support such a state *if it was focused on
<br>
the real dangers we face*.
<br>
<p>You know, the extropians list is a system as well. There are so many
<br>
erudite people on this list it's often difficult for me to express my
<br>
thoughts. I have lots of draft emails I never sent. I don't claim to be
<br>
an expert in anything outside web production. I have some differences
<br>
with core extropian values, the ones we're not supposed to debate. Maybe
<br>
like 'casual friday' in the workplace, we need a 'anything goes tuesday'
<br>
or whatever, a space where we can present ideas without them being
<br>
analyzed to death, so we can at least have them on the back burner of
<br>
our minds and let them percolate for while.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
