Bin Laden British cell planned gas attack on European Parliament
<br>
<p>By David Bamber, Chris Hastings and Rajeev Syal
<br>
<p>portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/09/16/wbin16.xml
<br>
<p>ISLAMIC terrorists based in Britain and controlled by Osama bin Laden
<br>
planned a devastating attack in February on the European Parliament building
<br>
in Strasbourg.
<br>
 
<br>
Osama bin Laden: may have as many as 5,000 supporters among young Muslims in
<br>
Britain
<br>
<p>A six-strong terror cell funded by the Saudi fugitive planned to kill all
<br>
625 Euro-MPs, and scores of officials, by releasing sarin gas into the
<br>
parliament building.
<br>
<p>The attack was scheduled to take place during the session of parliament from
<br>
February 11 to 14 this year and was to be the first in a series of assaults
<br>
against prominent buildings across Europe. Algerian terrorists based in
<br>
London and funded directly by bin Laden worked with counterparts in Milan
<br>
and Frankfurt.
<br>
<p>The plot was foiled after German police smashed the Frankfurt operation in a
<br>
series of raids. The British-based six men were arrested and charged with
<br>
offences under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
<br>
<p>The charges were subsequently dropped just days after the men appeared at
<br>
Horseferry Road magistrates' court, London. The Crown Prosecution Service
<br>
said that the decision was made for security reasons.
<br>
<p>Senior Special Branch officials have told The Telegraph that the decision to
<br>
cease action was prompted by a request from MI5. It is believed that the
<br>
intelligence agency had uncovered details of further atrocities and wanted
<br>
to monitor the group.
<br>
<p>Details of the plan were kept secret from Euro-MPs. They were, however, sent
<br>
an e-mail giving a warning about lapsed security in the building. One said:
<br>
&quot;Even after the e-mail was sent we still have a situation where people can
<br>
wander in and out of the building.&quot;
<br>
<p>In particular, there was concern that rules whereby visitors were supposed
<br>
to present passports at the main reception were being ignored.
<br>
<p>The Euro-MP added: &quot;Many of the British MEPs in particular are concerned
<br>
about security. Hardly anyone checks passes. The only time any one cares is
<br>
at meal times and that is so they can control the numbers in the canteen.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sarin gas is an easily made chemical weapon, 26 times more deadly than
<br>
cyanide. Developed during the Second World War by the Nazis, it is odourless
<br>
and almost impossible to detect. Its potential for use in a large crowd was
<br>
proved when Aum Shinrikyo, a Japanese cult, killed 12 people and affected
<br>
5,000 more using sarin gas on the Tokyo underground in March 1995.
<br>
<p>A spokesman for the European Parliament said: &quot;We take all threats to
<br>
security seriously and are constantly monitoring the situation.&quot;
<br>
<p>The disclosure that the European Parliament was a target will raise concerns
<br>
about the activities of bin Laden's followers in Britain and Europe. The
<br>
Telegraph has learnt that the Special Branch in London is also examining
<br>
allegations that two mosques in London have raised funds for a number of his
<br>
terrorist organisations in the past few weeks.
<br>
<p>One London mosque, where Afghans pray, has allegedly raised funds for the
<br>
terror group al'Qaeda, run by bin Laden. Abu Hamza, the Egyptian-born
<br>
cleric, has been accused of collecting funds for other proscribed groups at
<br>
the Finsbury Park mosque.
<br>
<p>Officers last year closed a community centre attached to a mosque in
<br>
Birmingham after money was raised to help train British-born terrorists
<br>
operating in Kashmir.
<br>
<p>British activists, who have supported bin Laden's activities in the past,
<br>
have also established a base in America. The Al Muhajiroun movement, members
<br>
of which have called for a jihad, or permanent holy war, overseas, has set
<br>
up in New York.
<br>
<p>The organisation's founder, Sheikh Omar Bakri, one of the leaders of
<br>
Britain's fundamentalist Islamic community, defended last week's attacks on
<br>
America but denounced the civilian deaths.
<br>
<p>He said: &quot;The US Government and its military forces are a legitimate target
<br>
as far as Islam is concerned. The American Government is engaged in
<br>
aggression and atrocities against Muslims in Iraq, Palestine, Afghanistan
<br>
and Sudan and supporting the pirate state of Israel.&quot;
<br>
<p>The movement's new US members remain in close contact with followers in
<br>
Britain, Pakistan and Lebanon. Anjem Choudary, who has now assumed
<br>
responsibility for Al Muhajiroun, also condemned last week's attacks on
<br>
civilians. 
<br>
<p>He claimed, however, that America had incited the response. &quot;America itself
<br>
has committed many atrocities in Muslim countries. You only have to see the
<br>
strength in countries like Palestine to see how some people feel,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>It is not the first time that British fundamentalists have extended their
<br>
operations to America. Last year The Telegraph revealed that a company
<br>
called Sakina Security was training volunteers to handle explosives and guns
<br>
at a base in the United States.
<br>
<p>The company, which is under investigation by the FBI, has set up a bank
<br>
account in London to raise funds for anti-Israeli forces among the
<br>
Palestinians.
<br>
<p>Security officials believe that as many as 5,000 young Muslims in Britain
<br>
may support bin Laden. Most show their solidarity by making regular
<br>
financial contributions, but about one in five of these supporters is
<br>
believed to have taken part in some form of active military service abroad.
<br>
<p>Dozens have also taken part in secret military training in sessions in
<br>
Britain, after which they were drafted into the military wing of the
<br>
International Islamic Front founded by bin Laden in 1998.
<br>
<p>A number of such British volunteers later died during active service for
<br>
Islamic forces in the conflicts in Chechnya, Bosnia and Afghanistan. Another
<br>
was killed on a suicide mission after being recruited to the cause through a
<br>
London-based group, Al-Maddad.
<br>
<p>The full extent of bin Laden's British network was revealed during the trial
<br>
in New York this year of four men in connection with the bombings in Africa
<br>
and other plots to kill US citizens.
<br>
<p>Some key figures in 21 terrorist groups outlawed in March by Jack Straw, the
<br>
then Home Secretary, under the provisions of the new Prevention of Terrorism
<br>
Act have gone into hiding since they were banned this year.
<br>
<p>The ban is intended to prevent them from raising funds, recruiting or in any
<br>
way supporting terrorist operations abroad. Sixteen of the banned groups are
<br>
Islamic organisations led by bin Laden's al-Qaeda.
<br>
<p>Some British volunteers who have fought for bin Laden are listed among the
<br>
dead on &quot;martyr websites&quot;, set up after the US cruise missile attack on bin
<br>
Laden's camps following the 1998 bombing of American embassies in Kenya and
<br>
Tanzania.
<br>
<p>Khalid al Fawwaz, the leader of another suspected bin Laden organisation in
<br>
Britain, is among six men being held in Brixton jail awaiting extradition to
<br>
America over his alleged part in the embassy bombings.
<br>
<p>He denies that his Advice and Reformation Committee was a front for bin
<br>
Laden and he has been in prison for more than a year fighting the US
<br>
request.
