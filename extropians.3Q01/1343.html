<em>&gt; &gt; I have already written some time ago on what is wrong with

<em>&gt; &gt; and high demand environment like an AI, in a markup language
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; designed for portable data representation.  I have nothing to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as I can scarcely think of a more crippled way to attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; write and maintains something as sophisticated as an SI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right now, if you want to write code, you have two options:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  You can write in plaintext.  ASM, C++, Java, and so on all count as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;flat text files&quot; for this purpose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  You can write in LISP, a language first created during the 1950s,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using linked lists, and later updated to use other flat list structures as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I can write in Smalltalk, Ruby, Python, Objective C, Haskell,
<br>
and several other languages besides.  Given a powerful enough
<br>
language (like Lisp) I can generate new languages quickly and
<br>
easily to fit the problem with quite new constructs.
<br>
<p>When Lisp was created is irrelevant.  Using linked lists
<br>
internally  is a huge oversimplification (and not true of
<br>
various aspects of all modern Lisp environements internally) and
<br>
not particularly relevant to its power except for its
<br>
fundamental low-level simplicity.  The lists are no more &quot;flat&quot;
<br>
than an XML file is.  Much less so as a matter of fact as
<br>
arbitrary functional expressions can be expressed within the
<br>
same simple list structure as well as macros that generate new
<br>
list structures (including new function expressions) dynamically
<br>
when invoked.  You can do nothing remotely of this power
<br>
starting from such a simple base and with as simple of an
<br>
interpreter loop using XML.  
<br>
<p>Almost every computer language concept devised in the last 5
<br>
decades was first developed, prototyped and refined in Lisp. 
<br>
There are good reasons for that as I hope you are well aware. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; (You can also write in bizarre Martian languages like APL.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; XML, for our purposes, is not a portable markup language consisting of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flat text containing angular brackets; it is a hierarchical, annotable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extensible free-flowing tree structure in which nodes have metadata.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need that.
</em><br>
<p>Bah.  I can annotate much more richly in Lisp and have the
<br>
annotation adapt itself to the context dynamically to boot.  XML
<br>
is not &quot;free-flowing&quot;. It is fairly rigid (or at least not
<br>
standardized) if you need to do something different than follow
<br>
the hierarchical layout imposed by its author.  If what you
<br>
really have is some type of network or a set of realations a
<br>
fixed hiearchical form is in the way.  You need to be forced
<br>
into a relatively fixed form like you need a hole in the head.
<br>
<p><p>It is hierarchical.  This is not a great thing for a programming
<br>
language.  There are many other very useful relationships of
<br>
elements as I am sure you are aware.  Using a tool that only has
<br>
one of them built-in and the rest as relatively ugly kludges is
<br>
one of the problem I have with using XML as a programming
<br>
language.  It is even somewhat of a problem even using it to
<br>
represent relatively (to XML) rich data relationships. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Luckily, there happens to be a standard for representing these structures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as flat text files containing angular brackets.  But that latter part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes relevant only when saving objects or programs to disk, or when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exposing Flare internals to human examination.  (The programmer, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course, usually writes in FlareSpeak rather than typing in FlareCode in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; XML.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Readying XML files is not a natural human capability.  I find
<br>
them painfully stultified for all but data that happens to be
<br>
pretty hierarchical.  It does not make sense to me that pushing
<br>
things into XML is more powerful than something truly flexible
<br>
for representing and building new kinds of relationships and
<br>
algorithms like lisp.  And Lisp is much easier to
<br>
programmatically read and manipulate than using XML.  As this
<br>
effort is primariy for building a SI capable of examining and
<br>
mutating its own code it seems natural to use a language more
<br>
geared to this and where most of the work along these lines to
<br>
date has been done.  
<br>
<p>Representing actual programming constructs in XML is even
<br>
uglier.  A bunch of tags for an interpreter to parse into
<br>
something more reasonable from a language that was never meant
<br>
for expressing algorithms and never designed for that purpose is
<br>
a huge and unnecessary kludge.  
<br>
<p>Translating from FlareSpeak to FlareCode (read something
<br>
reasonable for expressing algorithms to XML which is arguable
<br>
not at all reasonable for this) and back again costs machine
<br>
cycles that I don't see how this work can afford to waste.  And
<br>
you will do it pretty often as modules are swapped in and out of
<br>
the working consciousness as needed.  So do you plan some other
<br>
representation as some type of VM code to make this sort of
<br>
thing at all tractable?  When the interpreter interprets the
<br>
FlareCode (XML) exactly what kind of structure and internal
<br>
representation do you have in mind to hold state, already parsed
<br>
functions and so on?  Or do you plan to put all of that back
<br>
into XML again and again?
