<p><em>&gt; They staunchly oppose cloning, yet a perfectly legitimate

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From the Chronicle:
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; was resurrected through an advanced cloning technique. 
</em><br>
<p>IMPLAUSIBILITY ALERT!
<br>
<p>I don't have the time or the interest to investigate
<br>
this line of reasoning.  I'll simply state that it
<br>
seems highly implausible to me.
<br>
<p>- If cloning is a technique that produces organisms
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;similar to those from which the source genetic materials
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;were taken -- why is there so much evidence on Earth
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for the evolution of organisms through mutation and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;natural selection?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- What organisms were cloned?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- What was the point of doing so?
<br>
<p>- How are the messages delivered to &quot;Rael&quot;?
<br>
<p>- Why must &quot;advanced cloning&quot; be used to resurrect Jesus
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;when nanotechnology can perform the required adjustments
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to a physical embodiment?
<br>
<p>- What is the physical process of &quot;advanced cloning&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that performs this &quot;miracle&quot;?
<br>
<p>Spike, as much as I enjoy with you, any spearing of the
<br>
conventional wisdom that &quot;human cloning&quot; is &quot;unnatural&quot;,
<br>
it seems to me to bring the &quot;Raelians&quot; into the discussion
<br>
as a &quot;leg to stand on&quot; is a poor strategy.
<br>
<p>Why?  Primarily because you have to create plausible arguments
<br>
for the &quot;Raelian&quot; position.  That has to involve arguments
<br>
for their perspective *and* arguments against any other
<br>
perspective invoking other &quot;magic&quot; technologies.  There
<br>
must be a logical explanation for why our world should be
<br>
a specific instance of the one of many instantiations of the
<br>
many possible realities.  If one cannot come up with a reasonable
<br>
explanation for why the &quot;Raelian&quot; perspective is more probable than
<br>
many other perspectives (Christian, Islamic, Buddhist, etc.)
<br>
THEN ONE SHOULD NOT BE PROMOTING THE SUPPORT OF THEIR POSITION
<br>
(even if it happens to be aligned with your position for
<br>
entirely different reasons).
<br>
<p>I'd put the generalized Christian rejection of cloning
<br>
*and* the &quot;Raelian&quot; support of cloning in the same boat.
<br>
Both are based on arbitrary positions that have essentially
<br>
no supporting evidence or reasoning behind them.  They
<br>
are based on &quot;faith&quot; and I really doubt &quot;faith&quot; is something
<br>
used as a foundation in the Extropian Principles.
<br>
<p>There *is* a legitimate biomedical/ethical concern regarding
<br>
human cloning.  If human cloning produces individuals with
<br>
a higher mutational load (= higher birth defects) than normal
<br>
reproductive processes then it should be treated with caution.
<br>
If the normal processes that cause miscarriage of &quot;natural&quot;
<br>
developing humans can miscarry cloned humans with the same
<br>
efficiency, then I suspect most scientists concerns are misplaced.
<br>
(Read -- most of the testimony/news quotes on the subject
<br>
are scientists trying to court public opinion rather than
<br>
what they really think or believe.  Not a good situation!)
<br>
<p>I do not believe that outlawing cloning is a correct approach.
<br>
This could be shifted to -- Would you outlaw sex with the
<br>
intention of reproduction between individuals who are known
<br>
to have genetic defects likely to produce &quot;defective&quot; children?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From our perspective though, the question of &quot;cloning&quot; humans
</em><br>
for reproductive purposes should be separated from the
<br>
&quot;cloning&quot; of tissues for repair purposes.  The former is
<br>
a &quot;reproductive rights&quot; issue, while the later is a
<br>
&quot;survival rights&quot; issue.
