<em>&gt; &gt;Im not aware of any place unrestrained capitalism has even been tested.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Right.  Itsnever been *completely* without restraint.  But the early to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mid 19th Century US comes pretty damn close.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Right, it came close, but had some *vital* differences.  Such as the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the government made it illegal for employees to form unions and protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves and turned a blind eye to employers heinous acts against union
</em><br>
<em>&gt;formers.  This is not moral, not ethical, and not libertarian.  It is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government jobs to protect the rights of the individual, which includes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protecting them from employers hiring thugs to kill them.  In a true free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;market environment the government makes no restrictions on employers OR
</em><br>
<em>&gt;employees, in the early part of last century, restrictions were in place on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;employees behaviors.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;The thing that worries me is that if government is reduced to the point 
<br>
that many libertarians want, then they risk simply becoming lackeys of 
<br>
powerful business interests. This would simply result in the situation you 
<br>
describe above.&quot;
<br>
<p>But the key thing the libertarians support is a seperation of government
<br>
from business.  The above situations occured when the government DID
<br>
interfere with business on the side of the companies and not the workers,
<br>
now the government interferes on both sides, the company AND the worker.
<br>
Libertarians would legally restrict the governments ability to interfere in
<br>
business, thus preventing situations where the government unfaily favors one
<br>
side or the other.
<br>
<p>Comments like these make me think you have some misconceptions on
<br>
libertarianism, as this is one of the fundemental common tennets in it, that
<br>
is, the government should not interfere in business on either side.  
<br>
