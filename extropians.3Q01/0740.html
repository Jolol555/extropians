<em>&gt; Well, considering that no european nation recognizes the inherent rights

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Which /YOU/ do you mean by this? The NSA spies on pretty much everyone --
<br>
OTOH, so does most of the security services around the world; swedish SÄPO
<br>
included.
<br>
<p>The larger problem I see with american democracy than the existence of NSA
<br>
is the importance of the judicial system, and the almost ridiculous power
<br>
put into lawsuits.
<br>
Personally, I partly do agree with the label 'six year old with a
<br>
bazooka' -- but that is a feeling that I have from a sort of general
<br>
american attitude, partly combined with the extremely medial circus that US
<br>
elections form...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Moreover, the claim of us acting like a 'child with a bazooka,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpredictable and dangerous' is also laughable, unless you are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; congenital hoplophobe. The US has not initiated any conflicts at all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not wage open war on its own people, does not commit widespread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genocide with the flip of a hat, and does not confiscate the rights of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the accused in the heat of nationalistic hysteria. European countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make a career of doing just these things.
</em><br>
<p>That is quite generalizing. When did Sweden ever engage in any such thing?
<br>
Norway? Finland? Switzerland? Iceland?
<br>
<p>Admitted, many of the countries in continental Europe does have a slight pro
<br>
blem countering those claims -- but OTOH, what about Korea? Vietnam? Iraq?
<br>
Bosnia? The US is rather keen on claiming sole right to international
<br>
policing using partly gross amounts of violence in the process. It is very
<br>
much this tendency that leads us to the 'child with a bazooka' claim; the
<br>
fine and noble tradition of declaring foreign countries vile and evil, and
<br>
retaliate for this crime with high firepower -- not necessarily caring too
<br>
much for how correct the assessment actually is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; And lets face it, nut boy Dubya Bush hardly helps matters for increasing
</em><br>
America's popularity, after trashing the Kyoto treaty, pulling out of the
<br>
chemical weapons talks and starting up the old star wars program.  Most the
<br>
world is carefully watching Am
<br>
<em>&gt; erica at the moment, that well armed six year old seems to have been made
</em><br>
president.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And he just tolk you gun grabbing socialists to go stuff yourselves. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; note todays headlines in my local leftie rag hyperventilate over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bush Administration rejecting the bald faced attempt by the UN to get us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to surrender our 2nd amendment....
</em><br>
<p>You protect a law arming all citizens; an amendment that has effectively
<br>
driven the violence rates in the US skyhigh; and you call US 'gun grabbing
<br>
socialists'?
<br>
<p>I'm very much against arming civilians. I sincerely believe that it will
<br>
lead to more violence and criminality, not less. And I do not see how this
<br>
automatically makes my otherwise rather liberal (European measurement, not
<br>
US) opinions socialist.
