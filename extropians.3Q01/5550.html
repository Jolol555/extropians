<em>&gt;From: Charlie Stross &lt;<a href="mailto:charlie@antipope.org?Subject=Re:%20Fw:%20Back%20to%20Serfs%20and%20Royalty?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200109011111.f81BBkB25765@pheidippides.md.chalmers.se&gt;">charlie@antipope.org</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The social problem: a widening gap between the remuneration of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bosses and workers is divisive and encourages social unrest. A lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people don't see how some guy sitting in an office for the 40 hours of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the week when he isn't on the golf course can be doing something worth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say, a million bucks a year, when similar guys down on the shop floor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are bending metal and producing goods for a fiftieth of that. The root
</em><br>
<p>Yes... And on top of it, in situations as the current one in Argentina,
<br>
the guy in the shop floor dealing with a collapsing economy and state
<br>
is also tempted to draw a lot of nasty conclusions and act on them:
<br>
-&quot;the government says the country is in crisis and we should all strive
<br>
hard and tighten our belts... so why is this guy getting even a raise?&quot;
<br>
-&quot;recession is cutting on our sales and we see our wages reduced, and
<br>
some of my friends went into unemployment... so why is the boss buying
<br>
a new luxury house?&quot;
<br>
-&quot;we need to pay foreign debt services, so my taxes are going up and
<br>
my wages down... but why are these guys being spared by getting even
<br>
bigger wages?&quot;
<br>
and so on, and so forth...
<br>
<p>I'm very much an economic ignorant, for sure... but still I can see
<br>
the point that dynamics-generating gaps, differences and the &quot;ruthless
<br>
market&quot; are probably essential to get wealth creation going on. What
<br>
worries me, and (stealing an old phrasing from a not too old thread in
<br>
the list) keeps me up at night is how will we convince these millions of
<br>
guys about it, given the blatant inequalities and privileges going on.
<br>
It doesn't help that these pseudo-capitalists are all the time saying
<br>
&quot;we are the market&quot;, either.
<br>
<p>I'm getting slowly convinced that something must be done fast to relief
<br>
the pressure, because I can easily see lots of things blowing up to let
<br>
it out, and it might take us all an awful lot of time to get to the
<br>
&quot;bright future&quot; if the backlash gets that worse. Might we even NOT get
<br>
to that future, if it gets really really worse? I seem to be having that
<br>
one as my recurrent nightmare lately.
<br>
