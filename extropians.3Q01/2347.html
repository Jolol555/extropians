</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Hey, guess what? This is where you could say that paving the planet can,
<br>
in fact save it.
<br>
<p>Okay, look at it this way: the earth started with about 50 times the
<br>
atmosphere it has now, most of which was CO2, which is now locked in
<br>
limestone, with some in fossil fueld deposits. What are the major two
<br>
components of fossil fuels? Hydrogen and Carbon. What is limestone?
<br>
Calcium, carbon, and oxygen, right?
<br>
<p>So, what we do is extract calcium and water from sea water, and bind it
<br>
with CO2 from the atmosphere to build more and more concrete structures
<br>
over time: underwater cities, Mt Everest sized base anchors for
<br>
skyhooks, etc, thus sequestering that CO2, and all that unneeded water
<br>
in solid structures that are of use...
<br>
<p>The problem with the Great Wall of China is that its not round. Build a
<br>
huge concrete wall in a circle and you've got god's own rain cistern.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we put our minds to it, we could find many good ways to store
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fresh water on what is currently wetlands or unused dry land.  We may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to move some earth.  We can do that.  We can use the water as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a massive heat sink to moderate climates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Part of this vision is to stop the waste resulting from letting rivers dump into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sea.  Consider the salmon situation.  Looks to me like we could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build an artificial river of sorts, where we dump hatchery smolts into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sea with a limited amount of water out of a pipe perhaps 4 meters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in diameter with a flow rate of perhaps 50-200 cubic meters per second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flowing into Puget Sound in place of the current Columbia River Waste
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Site.  The Salmon go to sea, eat stuff, get big, then when they come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back, you catch em all, every last one of em.  Any that get upstream
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are just wasted food.  Extract some roe, start the whole cycle again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The wealth created in fish biomass alone would stagger the imagination.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that it ain't that simple. We've been wasting millions on
<br>
reintroducing the atlantic salmon to the Connecticutt River basin, but
<br>
few return because they are all getting caught by the damn europeans and
<br>
chinese fishing in the ocean.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then all that stored water can be piped all over the place, and vaaaast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stretches of land can be reclaimed.  One really needs to look down, next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time you fly over it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike Lorrey suggested a problem with inadequate soils for trees.  We can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal with this problem too, by establishing species that are water intensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not necessarily soil intensive, such as rain forest trees, which deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low soil quantities.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the problem isn't the lack of soil, its the lack of water
<br>
retention in the soil. What western soils need is a good 50-100 years of
<br>
big city people crap spread all over em. Biosolids are the way to go.
<br>
Build up a nice non-porous layer of clay to retain the water under the
<br>
biosolids, and away you go.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  I also don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think most Floridians would want to leave the country to move back north.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Im not suggesting that they do, however in my vision, the north country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from whence most Floridians came would eventually get a climate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resembling the Sunshine State.
</em><br>
<p>Nah, just pass a sunset law: anybody left after a certain date gets
<br>
cryoed.. ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Besides, we have developed lands and infrastructure.  You are trading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expensive, devolped, popular land for undeveloped, remote wilderness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No trade necessary.  This whole scheme hinges upon our ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control water sufficiently to hold the sea level at its current level.  Note
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that even this is &quot;unnatural&quot; for sea levels were rising before humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did anything to affect them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Even if you trade it, just what was Florida 50 years ago? Nothing but
<br>
swamp. It won't take that long to build again in the north, and the
<br>
great thing is that there is far more acreage up north than there is
<br>
down south. Give em ten acres for one and its all even.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Of, course I am trying to retire down in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Florida.  (&quot;It's always about Florida, isn't it Harv?&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ive nothing against Florida.  I have many fond memories from there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its not just Florida.  There is a lot of valuable land close to the sea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can stop the sea rise and keep those places.  We can make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bunch of new fresh water inland seas, creating a bunch of new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valuable waterfront property where now is wasteland, with nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but a bunch of weeds and unemployed wild animals on it that dont
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pay taxes.
</em><br>
<p>Thats right. Flood the Caspian and you'll quadruple the amount of
<br>
waterfront there. I'm still betting that it's water level rise the past
<br>
40 years has been a natural response to the .5-1 degree rise claimed by
<br>
scientists, and it will keep rising, accumlating rain water.
<br>
<p>There's the Death Valley as well as a high altitude landlocked basin in
<br>
Wyoming (and a few other places along the continental divide) that could
<br>
all be used as reservoirs.
