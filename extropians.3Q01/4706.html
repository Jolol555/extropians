<p>Yes, but the brighter public school kids generally are those who
<br>
succeeded in spite of the public school system. They generally taught
<br>
themselves. I think if you look at averages of public and private school
<br>
kids who go to college, you'll find that the private kids do far better,
<br>
even if you adjust for differences in average intelligence, etc.
<br>
<p>I would beg to differ, however, about private schools spoonfeeding their
<br>
kids. Catholic school kids, at least, in my experience, do teach
<br>
critical thinking and learning skills far better than any public school,
<br>
which is why you'll find jesuit educated people disproportionately
<br>
represented in the upper echelons of achievement in many fields.
