<p>
The post-moderns like narratives, so this is my &quot;narrative&quot; of how I came
<br>
to be a materialist.  I'd like to read how others came by their beliefs.
<br>
<p>In 1967, at the age of 19, I had an opportunity to evade the usual
<br>
boring History classes at the University of California at Riverside.
<br>
Revolution was in the air, and four professors decided to hold a
<br>
class comprised of fifteen carefully chosen students who would,
<br>
amidst general investigations of philosophy and culture, confront
<br>
the crisis that was overtaking institutions of higher learning in
<br>
general, and all the college campuses in the nation including ours
<br>
(or so it seemed) in particular.  My ticket to this class turned on,
<br>
I believe, one key sentence that I included in an essay that we had
<br>
to write in order to gain admittance.  My sentence was:  &quot;I do not
<br>
understand why everyone is not a scientific materialist.&quot;  I knew
<br>
that in an effort to create a diverse body of fifteen students, my
<br>
statement would make me stand out quite uniquely.  I was right.
<br>
Except for two of the four professors (one of biology, and a very
<br>
sharp history professor), I was alone in that class in holding
<br>
that at the lowest level, there is a mechanistic, scientific,
<br>
materialist explanation of everything.
<br>
<p>This view seemed quite uncommon.  I dare say that there wasn't
<br>
a single &quot;scientific materialist&quot; in the entire philosophy
<br>
department.  Back in our special class, we had one very old professor
<br>
emeritus visit on several occasions.  His name was Philip Wheelwright,
<br>
and he'd written a few books and was a well-known philosopher.
<br>
He and I squared off right away.  Soon I made a couple of trips
<br>
to his office where we debated some rather fundamental philosophical
<br>
positions.  It was the first time, but not the last, that although
<br>
arguing with someone much more sophisticated and intelligent than I,
<br>
I knew I was right and he was wrong.  Our debate finally broke up
<br>
over an irresolvable difference concerning human memory:  I contended
<br>
that there were physical operations in the brain that were responsible
<br>
for human memory (it's even conceivable that I had read a little of
<br>
Penfield's experiments by this time).  But to me, it simply *had* to
<br>
be true!  Surely all the atoms in one's head obeyed the same laws of
<br>
physics as atoms everywhere.  Well, he wasn't buying it.  He
<br>
absolutely refused to concede that human memory might one day
<br>
be explained by purely physical brain processes.
<br>
<p>Today, it may be hard for you to believe that this was the typical
<br>
stance of many well-educated people in 1967; but I swear it's true!
<br>
Incidently, the situation had improved by 1975:  at Riverside, one
<br>
new young philosophy professor, Larry Wright, was a materialist
<br>
par-excellance.  A younger friend of mine took courses from him,
<br>
and I visited his office with my friend on several occasions.  By
<br>
now, I would guess, (if I had to), that in America better than half
<br>
of a typical philosophy department's faculty would today consist
<br>
of people who I called &quot;scientific materialists&quot;.  I also think
<br>
that most people reading this list fall into that category too.
<br>
<p>But how, by age 19, had I come to be such a resolute materialist?
<br>
It happened this way.  As a sincere Christian, I read at age 15
<br>
with some dismay the attacks on my hero Euler at the hands of the
<br>
atheist Diderot and his droogies back in St. Catharine's court.
<br>
Voltaire had said, &quot;if the planets move in their orbits according
<br>
to fixed law, then how can we expect a little creature only five
<br>
feet tall to do as he pleases?&quot;.  I remember reading---although
<br>
have never been able to find the passage---a key phrase concerning
<br>
&quot;the dynamics of the particles of the brain&quot;.  Perhaps it was only
<br>
a passing thought on my part.  But my faith began to crumble, and
<br>
by age 17 I was a complete atheist.  Yet I was still haunted by
<br>
that phrase; if all the particles in my brain inexorably follow
<br>
physical law, then what am I?  I was lucky to meet a fellow chess-
<br>
player at about this time, who was ten years older and much wiser.
<br>
He was an atheist and a &quot;scientific materialist&quot;; I can even remember
<br>
two years before resenting his smug atheism.  Tim Delaney was a big
<br>
help in solidifying my materialist beliefs about then.
<br>
<p>Shortly after turning 18, I happened to ponder this:  if I am just
<br>
a collection of atoms, then what would happen if a machine were to
<br>
make an identical set of atoms?  Tim said, &quot;well, we know that all
<br>
carbon atoms are identical, according to quantum mechanics&quot;.  But
<br>
that was all the interest I could get from him (at this time).  Soon,
<br>
however, I was severely troubled by the idea:  if an exact molecular
<br>
copy of me existed, then which one would I be?
<br>
<p>This question has haunted me ever since, for thirty-five years now.
<br>
I confess that in a moment of mathematical persuasion, I decided that
<br>
the answer surely was that I had to be both of them equally.  Complete
<br>
symmetry had to reign, because if there was no soul, then what,
<br>
objectively, could possibly distinguish the two?  But this raised
<br>
a terrible problem.  I finally convinced Tim that the problem was
<br>
real, when I happened to think about how you'd feel if in a teleporter
<br>
experiment, there was a minute or two delay between the arrival of
<br>
the duplicate in the distant teleporter station, and the disintegration
<br>
of the original at the sending station.  During that minute, the original
<br>
soon-to-be-disintegrated would anticipate... what?  His death?  But no,
<br>
*he* is already at the remote station also!  By sheer force of logic, or
<br>
so it seemed to me, those feelings of imminent demise *must* be illusory.
<br>
The remote duplicate, BY THE FAITH OF A PHYSICIST also had to be me!  I
<br>
would survive!  Despite any feelings of impending doom that the original
<br>
might entertain.
<br>
<p>These arguments only solidified my materialism further.  Ultimately,
<br>
physics accounts for everything.  There was no room for soul, or
<br>
(for a short while) even higher order abstractions.  But I soon came
<br>
to realize that patterns have objective existence too; in fact the
<br>
key to the &quot;identity paradox&quot; was to realize that I was a *pattern*,
<br>
certainly not a particular collection of atoms.
<br>
<p>So that's how I became a &quot;scientific materialist&quot;, or as some would
<br>
say today, a &quot;functionalist&quot;.  A functionalist I remain (except for
<br>
the small interesting problem of lookup tables).
<br>
<p>I'd be interested in anyone else's narrative of how they came to 
<br>
acquire their early, decisive beliefs.
