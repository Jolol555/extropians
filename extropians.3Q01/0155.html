<em>&gt; &gt; In another example, an activist complained about the use of recombinant

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the use of RGBH.  There were 20 or more and it made her look bad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But if you looked closely at the list, all were Third World countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Venezuela, Mexico, etc., all poor nations.  The United States was the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; First World country that I saw.  So in fact the activist was basically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; correct in her initial statement, although the streamlined version of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the message was not right.  But I felt that Stossel was trying to snow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the viewers by putting up the list so fast that most people couldn't read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it carefully.  (I Tivo'd the show so was able to view it at my leisure.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could you post the list of countries? I'd hardly consider Mexico and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Venezuela undeveloped countries. They are industrialized, and Venezuela
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is actually a rather rich country, not poor at all.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, and the whole problem belies a wildly crazy set of agendas, and
<br>
behaviors that reflect differences in cultures, ideologies, and motivations.
<br>
The French are phobic about anything in their food... their lives center
<br>
around their food, mess with Mother Teresa, but don't mess with a French
<br>
man's food! America on the other hand would add putonium to cow's mik
<br>
next week if dairy farmers discovered it increased productivity by 30%. I
<br>
know that's an exageration... but I can point to literal examples if anybody
<br>
wants to go down that road... in America Business talks, &amp; everbody else
<br>
walks... so I'm not surprised at the names one finds on the list...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I had a lot of other complaints too, as when Stossel would subtly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; switch the question being discussed, starting from the question of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whether global warming is occuring and whether man is causing it, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then saying no, many scientists don't agree that global warming will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be harmful.  Both statements are true: there is a consensus that warming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is occuring and that it is very likely due in part to human activities;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, there is not a consensus among scientists, just among those with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same agenda.
</em><br>
<p>Actually the majority of scientist acknowlege that there is global warming.
<br>
There is a majority that acknowledge some part of that warming is human
<br>
based. There is good evidence that some of it is solar bases. There is even
<br>
a bit of evidence that geophysical phenomena are partially to blaim. We
<br>
may be in a temporary phase caused by several unrelated forces that for
<br>
the moment are in constructive interference, and that may change anytime.
<br>
The media is famous for making the public stupid crazy (eg. Oat Bran)...
<br>
and blowing little deals into big deals by the liberal application of bovine
<br>
feces wherever it may cause the increased growth of ratings. That said, we
<br>
are now at a time in our existence that we can actually impact the world,
<br>
and have. We've polluted entire oceans, and done some really stupid
<br>
things because they seemed like a good idea at the time. I refer to this as
<br>
the Jethro Factor (or a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.) It would be
<br>
wise beyond normal human limits to act with caution, and proceed with
<br>
all due prudence in the areas of human indeavor that might have negative
<br>
impact until we have adequate means to understand the likely results of
<br>
our actions. I figure that we'll have computers up to snuff in about 5 years.
<br>
Machines able to model in terms of tens of petaflops. We should declare
<br>
a 5 year project of cleaning up our messes and not making any new ones,
<br>
until we can see exactly what part we play in this dance. Then when the
<br>
final ballots come in we can begin looking at what the real playing field looks
<br>
like.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; and there is much less consensus about the net effects of the warming,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because some will be good and some will be bad.  Stossel emphasized the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; second point and let it be assumed that the disagreement covered the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other issue as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure. If it is actually occuring, and its not actually a bad thing (who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can complain about millions of square miles of tundra becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; productive agricultural acrage? Who can complain about the fact that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sea levels rise, this will actually INCREASE the amount of coastline,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and therefore more seashore fore everybody....)
</em><br>
<p>Unless we find out that tundra is a crucial part of the complex human ecology.
<br>
We are biota... that's it on that. You have abslutely no clue, what are the
<br>
essential life forms on this planet for the continued existence of Homo
<br>
Sapiens. Ecological systems are so complex, and you don't know that
<br>
tundra may impact carribu, that impact bears, that impact seals, that impact
<br>
orca, that impact krill, that impact grey whales, that impact through ten
<br>
other degrees of freedom human e. coli that impact you and me. Our
<br>
science is nowhere adavnced enough to figure out the critical interactions
<br>
and relationships between organic populations on this planet, and you
<br>
think melting the perma frost sound like an invitation to surfing... We need
<br>
to do a whole lot more taking care of the house while we're still living in
<br>
it... if you catch my drift. Every single experiment ever done with living
<br>
populations say diversity good, monoculture bad. It's a cornerstone to
<br>
chaotic self critical systems. You don't go screwing around with critical
<br>
ecologies without serious kaka falling out someplace you never even
<br>
expected. We don't even have the brights yet to make plans on the scale
<br>
you are suggesting, and we sure as hell shouldn't be making these kind of
<br>
impacts on the world in the one in a billion shot that it might prove to be
<br>
a good thing! There's a reason why nobody is agreeing!!! IT'S JUST TOO
<br>
COMPLICATED!!! Notice &quot;Too Complicated&quot; is not an invitation to
<br>
screw with. How many of you who have not had comercial jet training,
<br>
would feel comfortable taking a 747 up for a spin?!!! Then why in god's
<br>
name are you even talking about taking the planet for one?!!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; All in all I don't know how well Stossel has helped his cause with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; show.  One interesting point is that probably a lot more people watched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it due to all the publicity gained by pulling the interviews with school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; children at the last minute (interviews with other kids were substituted).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I think he got points for doing that in a way that illustrated the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulativeness of the greens.
</em><br>
<p>See this is really broken... it ain't the greens... and it ain't the business
<br>
nazis... it's people... and people are strange beasts... many hunger for
<br>
power and if they can get it through the collection of vast fortunes,
<br>
even to the detriment of their fellow human beings, you can count on
<br>
them doing that. Others find they can ahieve great power through social
<br>
or political cause. They are no less detrimental than the ones who uses
<br>
money as the vehicle for the collection and disbursement of power. Then
<br>
there are the masses... people who's ideas for the most part petrified by
<br>
the time they reached kindergarten. I knew a really bright guy at a job I
<br>
had a few years back. He was well read, sharp minded and a member
<br>
of PETA. He knew that I was an active environmentalist (I didn't say
<br>
however that I was deadly opposed to a number of environmental
<br>
organizations that based their movements not on sane, rational, goals
<br>
for providing a sustainable habitat, but on promoting what struck me as
<br>
more of a political agenda having almost nothing to do with long term
<br>
human existence. Forgive me in the end I'm a speciesist... I put humans
<br>
first above all, the other animals can line up behind us in single file by
<br>
complexity of brain function thank you.)  Anyway, he was reading his
<br>
magazine and complaining that The Nature Conservancy (my fav group)
<br>
was killing feral pigs in Hawaii. He said it wasn't right... and asked him
<br>
was it right for a human introduced species to wipe out native flora and
<br>
fauna, to extinct entire populations of plants, insects and birds? He
<br>
said the wire traps were inhumane... I said, maybe we should train
<br>
a contingent of special pig ranglers, whose job it is to hunt the pigs down
<br>
and then perform oral sex on them until they die from pleasure. Then
<br>
added... the pigs are bad.. we put them there... the onus is on us to
<br>
fix the mess we made... if you want we can apologize to the spirit of
<br>
the pigs in an attempt to dissapate the bad karma... but the pigs have
<br>
to go. The sad part is he didn't get it... the pigs had every right to be
<br>
in his mind, even to the detriment of everything else. This guy is not one
<br>
wit worse than some executive slime at Phillip Morris, who thinks they
<br>
can slip one by and wrap up a genration of kids with Joe Camel... or
<br>
for that matter the human slime who bought Georgia Pacific in the mid
<br>
80s to provide hard backing against his crumbling junk bond empire.
<br>
He was a heartbeat from ending up like Milken, instead he bought a
<br>
company that owned the largest body of Redwoods in the world. A
<br>
company that had been around for generations, one that took good
<br>
care of it's people, it's resources, and had built a stratedgy to last for
<br>
generations more. This guy went in, liquidated the surplus retirement
<br>
funds raised because of the high interest rates of the 70s, used them
<br>
to pay off the hostile takeover and began the systematic stripmining
<br>
of redwoods in California. Cutting at 30 times the rate of the original
<br>
owners, selling to Japan, and putting dozens of local sawmills out of
<br>
business. In ten years, he will have cut down the last commercially
<br>
viable readwood. He will have wipe out the forest in 25 years, and
<br>
that will be it on the largest redwood forest in the world... all gone.
<br>
If we're lucky we'll have bought 2 or3% to turn into state parks. At
<br>
that point the Japanese will sell us back our own redwood, for ten
<br>
time the price they paid. They're good business men. Lousy human
<br>
beings, but good business men.
<br>
<p>You can find heros and villains anywhere. That doesn't serve a very
<br>
useful purpose. I think that a more effective statedgy, might be to
<br>
look for what insures the best return on long term human survival
<br>
and ultimately evolutionary success. Anything that hurts the positive
<br>
likelihood of that outcome has to be carefully measured, and if need
<br>
be discarded as a threat to human longevity, and transcendance.
<br>
<p>Poor stewardship of the planet (and in this case I'm talking of only
<br>
that thin layer filled with life that begins in priority with homo sapiens)
<br>
by both econazis and blind business fanatics, is a threat to our long
<br>
term survival and advancement. We must be better at making sure
<br>
the world is able to sustain us as we become what we dream of
<br>
becoming. Things are not doing wonderfully at the moment, one of
<br>
the first things we can begin, as growing sentients, is preserve the
<br>
viability of our place of birth... at least until we are born!
