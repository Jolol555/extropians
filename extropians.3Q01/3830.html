<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And who does the exit polling? The media, which has a proven bias. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fact is that exit pollsters have to correct exit poll data because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pollsters ALWAYS project more votes for democrats than what actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occurs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You are absolutely right.  But the margin is small.  The fact that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ALWAYS do it makes it totally consistent and repeatable, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is why they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; are capable of correcting it as you noted above.  Their may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bias in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; methods, but they do fairly correct the data to present more accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; results.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, but what about the impact? Most people know that their one vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will have little impact on an election either way. When the media report
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the democrats are winning by even a small margin, this discourages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; republicans from going and voting, expecting the election to be lost.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I don't think they report this.  Even you mentioned that they &quot;correct&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for this bias.
</em><br>
<p>THEY correct for what THEY, in their biased opinions, is the correct
<br>
level of their own bias. I hope you are objective enough to recognise
<br>
how impossible this sort of scheme is to have any sort of accuracy.
<br>
<p>Its like asking police to accurately measure how much police brutality
<br>
there is, or the Chinese how much human rights violations there is in
<br>
China. You are guaranteed to get bad results.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; However, I agree with you that elections should not be predicted or polled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before the voting is done.  Even though I don't think it has been proven to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have interfered with the results, the potential is just too great.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Elections would be more objective and fair if the media did not try to call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them before they are finished.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's a nice neat way to let the media off the hook. I don't buy it. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have personally seen exit pollers ignore people with conservative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; leanings and select people who look 'liberal' to participate in exit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; polls, whether its done by hair length, clothing quality, or skin color
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is irrelevant, it is profile that is at least as wrong as the police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; profiling of blacks that liberals complain of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you see conspiracies more often than I do.  Conspiracies are not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simplest explanation for the observed data.  Mere stupidity, sloppiness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confusion are often more likely explanations.  It is true that everyone has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biases, and biases skew results, and more liberals seem to become media
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, so the media has a liberal bias.  But I don't think any of this was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a deliberate plot by the Left.  It just evolved that way.  You give the Left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too much credit if you think they could have infiltrated and taken over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost all media.
</em><br>
<p>Did I say 'conspiracy'? No, I did not, so I think that it is you who is
<br>
assuming things here. I think that it is perfectly normal for people who
<br>
a) are vested in their own opinions to a high degree (as political
<br>
activists generally are), b) think people like themselves are more
<br>
honest, friendly, and trustworthy, and c) dislike people they disagree
<br>
with, will tend to conciously or subconciously behave at an exit poll in
<br>
a way which is biased in favor of their own side.
<br>
<p>I also am of the opinion that Democrats generally feel more strongly
<br>
that they and their allies are more 'hard done by', that their opponents
<br>
'owe them something' for past sins (as per the reparations and other
<br>
issues), and thus, as individuals, are more amenable to subtly skewing
<br>
the results they collect by cherry picking poll subjects.
