<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Brooks writes &quot;Now that the springtime of the 21st century has arrived,
<br>
socialism should be put on the ash heap of history. Like religion and
<br>
romanticism, socialism may have some value as 'necessary fiction', but is
<br>
lacking in meaning: Gun-toting, drug-wholesaling Leftist guerrillas call
<br>
themselves 'socialist'. There exist libertarian socialists &amp; democratic
<br>
socialists; (un)scientific socialists and National Socialists (National
<br>
Socialists are the most honest 'socialists'-- they truly mean business).&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Socialists complain that socialism has never been given a chance; has never
<br>
been tried, neglecting to mention the reason socialism has never been tried...
<br>
it is too flawed.
<br>
<p>For brevity, here are a couple of the most salient defects of socialism:
<br>
humans obviously differ greatly in physical and mental abilities; there are
<br>
robust physical specimens who are retarded, and then there are the Stephen
<br>
Hawking, brilliant minds in bodies that hardly move a muscle. Transhumanists
<br>
have correctly pointed out that the only hopes are technologies (including
<br>
intelligence augmentations).
<br>
<p>Another major flaw with socialism is the massive roadblock of our
<br>
preoccupation with status. Most humans want not only wealth, but also status;
<br>
and there is no mystery why-- our physical and mental inequality makes us so
<br>
insecure that we consciously or unconsciously seek status, and use the
<br>
government to rearrange our status relative to others. This means that
<br>
politics is endless, purposeless maneuvering and argument. From a stagnant
<br>
conservative viewpoint this works well, but such turmoil would ultimately
<br>
prove an enemy of transhumanism. Transhuman Slashsite News habitues clearly
<br>
think there is no invisible force protecting us; humanity survives for many
<br>
non-mystical reasons, including the unpleasant fact that some humans are
<br>
willing to sacrifice themselves. Certain organisms are generally willing to
<br>
let themselves be destroyed for the common good, but not humans; unlike ants,
<br>
humans have large brains, and it is rightly accepted that only a fool would be
<br>
self-sacrificing; masochism is certainly not transhumanist.
<br>
<p>I personally think another reason socialism is unworkable and outdated is that
<br>
the positive aspects of interpersonal relations are somewhat overrated. People
<br>
constantly lie to each other to smooth things over-- and use their instinct or
<br>
intelligence to make their dissembling more undetectable. 'White lies' are
<br>
extremely common; an allegedly innocuous example being the lies people tell
<br>
when receiving a gift they don't want-- how many persons say &quot;this isn't what
<br>
I want&quot;? Rather, a 'thank you' is in order, and the gifts are discarded in
<br>
some fashion later on. More serious -- and unpleasant -- examples of
<br>
disingenuosness could of course be dredged up; my point here is that
<br>
individual honesty and goodwill are exaggerated; I personally pin more
<br>
optimism on such as ameliorating race-ethnic-cultural-gender disputes;
<br>
reducing nationalist fervor, and so forth. A concrete example is the Civil
<br>
Rights movement in America: no one can prove that blacks and whites get along
<br>
better today than during decades previous. Yet (partially thanks to the Civil
<br>
Rights movement) if U.S. blacks had their own nation today, it would be one of
<br>
the wealthiest on earth. So, it cannot be denied that, though individual backs
<br>
and whites may not be any more civil to each other, AS A CLASS, blacks are
<br>
doing better... i.e. whites now more readily realize the advantages of doing
<br>
business with blacks. But socialism implies much more cooperation at the level
<br>
of the individual, and what hard evidence exists at this time that such
<br>
cooperation will increase? --None whatsoever.
<br>
<p>Socialism to one side, I can anticipate a counter-argument to my pessimistic
<br>
aspect here. Transhumanists might respond that the political situation may
<br>
dramatically improve due to science; 'spontaneous order'; etc; however, though
<br>
I appreciate scientific speculation, social/political speculation has proved
<br>
quite disappointing and I prefer to avoid such.
<br>
<p>Friends, someone is going to have to 'rack their brains'; and we are going to
<br>
have to go all-out to spread the word.
<br>
