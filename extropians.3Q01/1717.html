<p>&lt;&lt; I googled &quot;Garabaldi Redshits&quot;, came up with nada.  Please explain
<br>
&nbsp;Garabaldi's Redshits, Spud.  spike &gt;&gt;
<br>
National Leader Garabaldi led the movement against the monarchists with his 
<br>
plucky team of redshirts (not to be confused with Mussolini's balckshirts). 
<br>
You will probably have to go to a historical website.

<p>Calling on the Italians of Montevideo, Garibaldi formed the Italian Legion in 
<br>
1843, whose black flag represented Italy in mourning while the volcano at its 
<br>
center symbolized the dormant power in their homeland. It was in Uruguay that 
<br>
the legion first sported the red shirts, obtained from a factory in 
<br>
Montevideo which had
<br>
intended to export them to the slaughter houses of Argentina. It was to 
<br>
become the symbol of Garibaldi and his followers. The formation of his force 
<br>
of volunteers, his mastery of the techniques of guerilla warfare, his 
<br>
opposition to Brazilian and Argentinean imperialism, and his victories in the 
<br>
battles of Cerro and Sant'Antonio in 1846 not only assured the freedom of 
<br>
Uruguay but made him and his followers heroes in Italy and Europe. The fate 
<br>
of his patria continued to preoccupy Garibaldi.

I went into the Corso with some friends; it was filled with citizens and 
<br>
military. The carriage was stopped by the crowd near Doria palace; the 
<br>
lancers of Garibaldi galloped along in full career. I longed for Sir Walter 
<br>
Scott to be on earth again,
<br>
and see them; all are light, athletic, resolute figures many of the forms of 
<br>
the finest manly beauty of the South, all sparkling with its genius and 
<br>
ennobled by the resolute spirit, ready to dare, to do, to die..(pp.412-413). 
<br>
They had all put on the beautiful dress of the Garibaldi legion, the tunic of 
<br>
bright red cloth, the Greek cap, or else round hat with Puritan plume. Their 
<br>
long hair was blown back from resolute faces; all looked full of courage. 
<br>
They had counted the cost before they had entered on this perilous struggle; 
<br>
they had weighed life and all its material advantages against liberty, and 
<br>
made their election; they turned not back, nor flinched, at this bitter
<br>
crisis. I saw the wounded, all that could go, laden upon their baggage cars; 
<br>
some were already pale and fainting, still they wished to go. I saw many 
<br>
youths, born to rich inheritance, carrying in a handkerchief all their 
<br>
worldly goods. The women were ready; their eyes, too, were resolved, if sad. 
<br>
The wife of Garibaldi followed him on horseback. He himself was distinguished 
<br>
by the white tunic; his look was entirely that of a hero of the Middle Ages, 
<br>
- his face still young, for the excitements of his life, though so many, have 
<br>
all been youthful, and there is no fatigue upon his brow or 
<br>
cheek...(pp.413-414)
<br>
<p>Loose the google, embrace altavista.
