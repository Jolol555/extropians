<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; I just think it is a little rash of you to say that. Profit motive sees 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; much more &quot;sense&quot; in promoting expensive medical maintenance programs that 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; keep people on medications for the rest of their lives. Medical companies 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; don't like to spend money on researching ways to prevent or cure ills. That 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; cuts out their market. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I wouldn't say that. I would say that they only focus on health problems 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;for which there is a significant market, generally, and when they find a 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;drug treats a rather rare disease, with lets say only a few hundred 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;cases in the entire world, they have to not only divide the cost of 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;tooling up, producing, and distributing the few doses of the drug to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;such a small market, that market has to absorb the huge amounts of 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;research that went into discovering that drug. If, say, one dose costs 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;many thousands of dollars, the drug company generally won't even put it 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;through FDA trials (which is necessary to make it coverable by 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;insurance), because such trials would require the company to treat the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;entire population that is sick, which kills the market, and you can't 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;get paid for it after the fact by the insurance company. 
<DIV></DIV>
<P>&nbsp;All true...but what does that have to do with what English said?</P>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; Many of the great success stories in clobbering diseases are publicly 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; funded. They drive such things as health and sanitation education, and 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; vaccination programs. Of course these then provide the market and incentive 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; for corporations to refine and supply the vaccines, etc. Both sides 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; (capitalist and publicly funded organisations) need each other to create a 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; balanced environment. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; If we had just capitalism managing medicine then we would see incredibly 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; expensive medicine that would serve the rich (that's where the money is), 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; but not much else. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;You are improperly assuming that no capitalist would engage in 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;philanthropic activities, which is actually how much of the non-profit 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;research is funded. 
<DIV></DIV>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Drop. Bucket....</P>&nbsp;
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; If we had only publicly managed medicine then we would see medicine ossify 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; and become more and more entrenched in tradition. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; Neither is the whole solution. Diversity, as in most things, is important. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; I worry when the economic rationalist religion is propagated as the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; ultimate truth. It isn't. The world just isn't that simple. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; Did you know that many people who travel to USA worry about getting ill 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; while over there and accruing massive and crippling medical bills for 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; treatment that in Australia or UK or Europe would be relatively 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; inconsequential? Your medical system is heavily privatised and the most 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; expensive on the planet. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Part of the reason it is so expensive is because socialist health 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;systems externalize their highest costs onto our market, which drives up 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;demand and therefore prices. How is this done? By purposely rationing 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;expensive treatements such that the waiting lines for these treatments 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;are longer than the life expectancy of the patients, so they instead 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;come here to the US, pay out of their own pocket to get treated, and 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;their buying that treatment here drives up the price here for our sick 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;people to get the same treatment. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;If socialized health care systems provided the same access to care that 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;we provide here, then our system would not be so expensive. 
<DIV></DIV>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Let's see:&nbsp; If our health care is the most expensive, it's because of all the people coming over here and getting medical care b/c they can't get it at home? How very strained....</P>
