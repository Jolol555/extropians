<p><em>&gt; I do not differentiate between classes or disciplines of knowledge, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in science compared to morality for instance. There are simply different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contexts in which we devote similar forms of thought. Each contains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protocols, authority, and experience. Each is a social endeavor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not agree with people who say morality does not exist because there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are no facts to support it. What is a fact? Isn't a fact just what you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me, or someone has chosen to be significant? Saying there are no facts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to support morality implies there are facts to support something else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is anything really supported by facts? No. Not to me. Things are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supported only by an argument someone makes, or the will of that person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make an argument.
</em><br>
<p>Probably the nominalists are divided from us realists mostly by
<br>
terminological disagreements.  I will argue that some of the
<br>
nominalist sentences above are nearly incoherant.  Take &quot;Isn't a
<br>
fact just what you, or me, or someone has chosen to be significant?&quot;
<br>
<p>Well, what is a &quot;someone&quot;?  Is there a fact of the matter?  In your
<br>
coordinate system, it appears that the following are fundamental:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;* people
<br>
&nbsp;* will
<br>
&nbsp;* significance
<br>
&nbsp;* argument
<br>
&nbsp;* context
<br>
&nbsp;* thought
<br>
<p>while realists regard &quot;rocks&quot;, &quot;trees&quot;, &quot;people&quot;, etc., as fundamental.
<br>
Moreover, in our &quot;web of belief&quot;, we can account for a great deal of
<br>
what happens in our world (to you, &quot;in our model of the world&quot;) by
<br>
evolution.  What really bugs you about calling &quot;some birds can fly&quot; 
<br>
a fact?  
<br>
<p>Our epistemology is also in accordance with natural learning 
<br>
among primates:  babies are wired to recognize objects, numbers,
<br>
and faces, and they build up their higher order abstractions
<br>
(e.g., &quot;thought&quot;, &quot;context&quot;, &quot;argument&quot;) on the backs of the
<br>
lower order abstractions only after many years of familiarity
<br>
with the latter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When you tell me what reality is, or is supposed to be, you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempting to dictate to me what things to find significant and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disregard.
</em><br>
<p>No (especially on this list) we defend your right to make as
<br>
many errors as you like.  It's just that some things, e.g.,
<br>
&quot;the sun won't rise tomorrow&quot; is erroneous.  If you want to
<br>
take a correction as an attempt to control your thinking,
<br>
then you are being way too closeminded.
