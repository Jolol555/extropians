Earlier I wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps scientists and people especially prone to demanding strict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materialist reasons for everything exhude some sort of suppressor field.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or, perhaps more likely, they suppress something deep within themselves,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within mental structures evolved over millions of years of evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are not yet revealed to science.
</em><br>
<p>I dont have kids of my own so maybe parents can weigh in here. Sometimes
<br>
I get the impression that young kids are extremely psychic, or if not
<br>
'psychic', then aware of their surroundings in a very different way than
<br>
adults. Not just a difference in degree, but in kind. They of course
<br>
lose this as they are confronted with the harsh realities of life, and
<br>
we normally dont think of this as a loss. They don't have the language
<br>
skills to describe this nor the perceptual skills to realize that
<br>
grownups don't see the world in the same way, so recognition of this is
<br>
difficult.
<br>
<p>And of course parents discourage using this different perceptual view. I
<br>
recall one day on the DC metro (subway) this guy got into the car right
<br>
as the door closed and caught his foot for just a second. (The doors are
<br>
gentle and forgiving, like jesus). This real young kid said 'Daddy! I
<br>
have super-powers. I made the door close on that guy's foot'. Daddy
<br>
responded 'No, you don't son' and proceeded to explain how the door
<br>
mechanisms worked. Perhaps a better response would have been 'Yes you
<br>
do, son. But you must remember to always use your powers for good, and
<br>
never for evil'. I think the resulting increase in self-confidence would
<br>
result in a better potential future payoff compared to the dim chance
<br>
the kid would turn schizo or something.
