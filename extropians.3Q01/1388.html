<p>&quot;This is very disturbing, but it was probably bound to happen at some point.

<p>Apparently they have decided to ban internet use not because it is
<br>
inherently bad, but because they don't like the bad &quot;stuff&quot; available on 
<br>
it.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is indeed bad news, but I also don't find it very surprising. Regimes 
<br>
that are quite bad but somewhat less repressive, perhaps, than 
<br>
Afghanistan's, such as those of Syria and Myanmar, have had bans on the 
<br>
internet in place for some time.  Syria has recently started to allow 
<br>
limited access, though, and when I was there in 1997-98 (when the full ban 
<br>
was still in effect) I found that the well-to-do were covertly accessing the 
<br>
net by dialing over to Lebanon.  The same may be the case in Myanmar (calls 
<br>
to Thailand, perhaps?), but I didn't come across it when I was there.  Also, 
<br>
international long distance in Myanmar is very expensive, with the lowest 
<br>
rate from the capital, Yangon to the US, for example, being around 
<br>
US$3.00/minute, making even covert long-distance access available only to 
<br>
the well-to-do (at hotels it's more like $12.00/minute).  Add to that the 
<br>
fact that most of the well-to-do in Myanmar are themselves government 
<br>
ministers and other officials, and you have a very grim situation indeed.
<br>
<p>I understand that Saudi Arabia has partially lifted its ban.  I haven't been 
<br>
to Iraq, but I can guarantee there is no internet access there.  In Sudan 
<br>
the internet was completely unavailable during visits in 1996-97, but it 
<br>
wasn't entirely clear if this was because of a ban or just the crumbling 
<br>
telcommunications infrastructure.  In Kyrgyzstan in 1996 email was available 
<br>
via UUCP (hey, welcome to the 1970s!) but the US Ambassador there told me 
<br>
that the country's only email node was located at the President's house, and 
<br>
that his staff kept an eye an all the messages.  So, even when email is 
<br>
available it can be of limited use in political activism and other 
<br>
activities states might frown upon.  Others on this list would know better 
<br>
than me to what degree encryption could be used to get around that type of 
<br>
snooping in a primitive system like UUCP.
<br>
<p>The Afghanistan government seems to enjoy thumbing its nose at the outside 
<br>
world with announcements of new and novel methods of repression and 
<br>
self-destruction, but now one is left to wonder, what's next?  After all, 
<br>
they've banned women from the workplace, as well as games, paper bags (might 
<br>
be made from pages of the Koran,) even clear windows facing the street in 
<br>
private homes (someone walking by could see a woman inside, so they must be 
<br>
painted black,) men from cutting their beards, and now the internet.  Before 
<br>
long they'll come up with something new, but they're running out of things 
<br>
to ban!
<br>
<p>I'd hazard a guess that, even before this ban, there were fewer than fifty 
<br>
internet-connected computers in all of Afghanistan, and that most of them 
<br>
belonged to NGOs (foreign Non-Governmental Organizations).  Don't get me 
<br>
wrong, zero is worse than forty or fifty, and this news certainly shows that 
<br>
things, as bad as they are in Afghanistan, can get even worse.
<br>
<p>I'm reminded me of those absurd, poorly-designed internet forms where you 
<br>
fill in your country, and the first one that comes up is Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>Bill
