<p><em>&gt; Words are tricky here.. when somebody says &quot;I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the person I was&quot; we understand them to mean that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have changed in some significant way... but we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand them to mean that they are a new entity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separate and distinct from their previous self, like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child is from a parent.
</em><br>
<p>yes, thank you for pointing that out to everyone, so
<br>
that miscommunication here is minimized.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, I'm not the man I once was. v?v
</em><br>
<p>I take it that Loree Thomas was once a man.  Now if that
<br>
isn't a transformation of body image, then I don't know
<br>
what is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Still... I am me.
</em><br>
<p>This is what I would have expected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And that is my take on what will happen if and when we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are able to move our minds from one physical body to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another (whether that be biological, electromechanical,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some combination of the two or something completely new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that has no current analogue)... we will still perceive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves as &quot;us&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how there is any doubt about this.  Now let's
<br>
say that I'm uploaded, and just for convenience I am able
<br>
to specify my virtual reality.  It then follows that
<br>
especially if I have a virtual reality that is very similar
<br>
to what I experience now, then I should expect absolutely
<br>
no difference to my &quot;self&quot;.  While it is true that in the
<br>
somatic marker hypothesis of Damiaso, some data concerning
<br>
our emotional state is allegedly stored in the body, it
<br>
seems more likely to me that Damiaso is mistaking what is
<br>
really stored in the brain's model of the body for what is
<br>
stored in the body.  But even if that's wrong, it still 
<br>
follows that just as I may store information on paper using
<br>
a pencil, a virtual reality will allow me to store emotions
<br>
in what I think is my body.  A discussion of virtual reality
<br>
that I find very thorough is presented in David Deutsch's
<br>
&quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot;, a book equally also about the many
<br>
worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, and epistemology.
<br>
<p>The case is even more strongly made that somehow there has
<br>
arisen in our culture of late a peculiar fascination with
<br>
body image.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The real interesting part comes when and if we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make copies... multiple instantiations of a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I lean towards the idea they will all equally be me...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there is a soul, it will have to be divided up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between them, I guess.
</em><br>
<p>There have been many long discussions on this list about
<br>
the problem of identity.  I happen to agree with you,
<br>
and believe that a person can be in more than one place
<br>
at a time, just as he or she can be at different times
<br>
in the same place.  Duplicates are self.
<br>
