<p>Hmmm... I feel unease...
<br>
<p>I'm certain you weren't being racist when you said this, and basically I 
<br>
agree with what you said, but in this time of furiously swinging pendulums 
<br>
I think it is worth reminding everyone that Israel is not one entity any 
<br>
more than the Palestine or America or Australia is. It is millions of 
<br>
individuals. They share land, and in many cases they may share certain 
<br>
mindsets, but humans are so variable that it is extremely hard to 
<br>
categorise them as a group.
<br>
<p>It is scary that because of some extremely unwise decisions by policy 
<br>
makers in Israel (undoubtedly impelled by seige mentality and having the 
<br>
most powerful ally, as well as commonly held belief of religious 
<br>
righteousness) the people on those lands and their relatives abroad (Jewish 
<br>
people) might once again come under attack. We have to be careful in our 
<br>
use of inflammatory words because of their magnifying effect in dangerous 
<br>
times. In these times words can literally kill.
<br>
<p>Of all the people I have met and enjoyed the company of, those who called 
<br>
themselves Jews have been among my favorites. It would be terrible if due 
<br>
to some opportunistic policy makers in Israel those people everywhere came 
<br>
under threat.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
