<em>&gt; This was already discussed on Cryonet.  Many people there did

<p>Either of those first two would have had my vote, yes. Oh well. One man, one
<br>
vote. Saul's the man. I'll cheerfully defend the right of other people to
<br>
spend their money as they see fit, no matter how gloomy it makes me. I mean,
<br>
at least they're spending it on life extension. There's plenty of
<br>
billionaires out there with no ideas as to what to spend their money on, and
<br>
no inkling that they could prevent their own deaths simply by putting their
<br>
vast wealth to work right now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But this obviously not what Saul Kent and Will Faloon wanted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps, they have an eye for marketing and spectacle which we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sadly lack.  We will see whether it is a boondoggle or the great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leap forward.
</em><br>
<p>I'm hoping that it will be rendered irrelevant one way or another. Consider
<br>
what is spend on AIDS research, foundations, pharma developement, versus
<br>
what is spent on anti-aging...and then ponder the value of activism.
<br>
<p>If, ten years from now, $180 million isn't a drop in the bucket of pure
<br>
anti-aging research funding, then we're all in trouble. My take on the
<br>
situation is that this increase in funding won't happen unless a deliberate,
<br>
concerted and persistant effort is made to change the societal view of aging
<br>
and bring life extension into the mainstream.
<br>
<p>Until the guy in the street thinks about aging at least as much as he thinks
<br>
about AIDS, cancer and heart disease (and in the same context), death by old
<br>
age is likely for all of us.
