<em>&gt; Unfortunately, among adults and among nations, admiration

</em><br>
<p>I think that envy will always arise towards those considered
<br>
more capable than oneself under economic and sociological
<br>
systems based primarily upon scarcity models.  In such systems
<br>
the premise is that there is not enough to go around so the most
<br>
able or in some sense best should get the most first, perhaps
<br>
leaving too little for oneself.  As we come into increasing
<br>
abundance the basis for envy should decrease if and only if our
<br>
social, economic and even psychological systems adjust
<br>
accordingly.  If we truly want to reduce envy and simultaneously
<br>
get more of the people behind full progress then we need imho to
<br>
find ways of sharing the increased wealth that are more
<br>
effective.  
<br>
<p>I do not believe that the market economy by itself is doing that
<br>
sufficiently.  At the bottom end it is far too easy to fall into
<br>
economic destitution in the US today.  There are too many people
<br>
working two or more jobs under poor conditions just to manage to
<br>
survive at all for me to believe that the market alone leads to
<br>
the good life.  Too many people that do have better lifes are
<br>
have more debt than savings and are only a few paychecks from
<br>
bankruptcy and perhaps homelessness.  Upstream their are too
<br>
many of even the technologically elite who have no life but
<br>
their work not only or even principally because of their love of
<br>
the work but due to the shape of the economy and the conditions
<br>
of their unemployment within it.  Something is out of kilter.
