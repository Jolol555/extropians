<p>I guess I'm falling down on the job, being the List Farmer. Thank you for
<br>
providing the figures, Robert. To refresh everyone's memory, since it's been
<br>
a couple of days, Mike Lorrey wrote:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;US farm subsidies are actually quite low at the moment&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>RB responded:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;In 1999 (the last year available), total &quot;Farm marketings&quot; were $188.6B.
<br>
&quot;Government payments&quot; were $20.6B or almost 11% of the &quot;marketings&quot; value.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It's quite a stretch to call subsidies amounting to 11% of &quot;marketings&quot;
<br>
value low. In fact, in at least some individual cases (I suspect in MANY
<br>
such cases) the subsidies make the difference between a net loss and a net
<br>
profit.
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey continues:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; They don't
<br>
subsidize low prices either, they are used to prop up prices. If we
<br>
ended subsidies entirely, US food prices would be far lower. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I need to do some research on this, as I'm presently only aware of what's
<br>
happening locally. I get a newsletter each month from my local Agricultural
<br>
Extension Service, a branch of the USDA. The subsidies currently being
<br>
offered are in the nature of &quot;disaster&quot; relief. Farmers go to their partners
<br>
(maybe more accurate to say their bosses) the bankers, mortgage everything
<br>
they own, and put the whole wad into a thousand acres of one or two verities
<br>
of corn. No diversification, and it's all planted at the same time, in
<br>
accordance with the instructions from the seed and chemical companies
<br>
(which, these days, is generally the same company). If the corn burns up in
<br>
a drought, it's considered a disaster rather than poor planning on the part
<br>
of the farmer, and the federal gov't bails the farmer out.
<br>
<p>The real beneficiaries of this policy are the banks, the seed/chemical
<br>
companies, and the politicians. I fail to see how this policy props up
<br>
prices. Farm prices are currently artificially low, and if more realistic
<br>
accounting methods were used by farmers, I don't think even the subsidies
<br>
would keep many farms from showing losses.
<br>
<p>Among other misleading items on the financial statements is this: today's
<br>
dominant methods of farming rely on what you might call strip mining the top
<br>
soil. In most cases where a natural resource is used up a bit each year, a
<br>
business must annually book a fraction of the value of the resource as
<br>
depletion expense. This is not done by farmers, nor do farmers relying on
<br>
non-rechargeable aquifers for irrigation (such as the Olalla) book depletion
<br>
expense for water consumed.
<br>
<p>It's a great tragedy to see this method of agriculture being exported. For
<br>
Ayn Randians out there who support Big Business All the Way--I think some of
<br>
you have misinterpreted Rand's writings. The Agribusiness-Seed/Chemical
<br>
Co.-US Government partnerships are the equivalents of Orren Boyle's
<br>
Associated Steel and Ma Chalmer's soybean project (did I get the names
<br>
right? It's been many years since I read *Atlas Shrugged*).
