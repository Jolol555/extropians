</em><br>
<p>OK, I'll go along with that. The point I was making is that religionists
<br>
(people who claim to believe in some variety of organized religion) are
<br>
_dishonest_, because the only other explanation is that they are totally
<br>
messed-up to believe the nonsense that they claim to believe. IOW, sensible,
<br>
reasonable observers will not take seriously their claims that they sincerely
<br>
believe their dogma. Or, to put it as succinctly as I can, no one but an
<br>
imbecile could actually believe that crap, and they're not imbeciles, hence
<br>
they're liars (and devious ones at that).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sexual liberation threatens all conservatives (not just the religious)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it dangerously counters hard-won traditions established over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundreds of years that perhaps enabled the society to become stable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and prosperous.  To what degree societal traditions (e.g. belief in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God) can be discarded requires careful thought and good judgment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and should be addressed one at a time (see the works of Hayek for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a thorough discussion).
</em><br>
<p>No sweat, I'm feeling generous ©¿©¬
<br>
So, I'll let that one go. Who cares about conservative prudes. They're not
<br>
much of a hazard to transhumanists (some of whom may not care that much for
<br>
sex anyway).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Delusions?  &quot;Come to your senses&quot;?  You and I may disagree with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the statements, but that hardly makes them delusional.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry about that, but I still consider it delusional to believe in more than
<br>
one reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think that it's a delusion.  The extent of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integrity of behavioral responses and information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processing make &quot;selves&quot; as real (in many people, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least) as many other higher level patterns.
</em><br>
<p>You're right. A delusion is not an illusion. I meant illusion, not delusion.
<br>
Thank you for catching that. You make a dynamite editor. ©¿©¬
<br>
Selves are illusions in the sense that perfect circles are illusions. These
<br>
higher level patterns exist only as ideals, not as demonstrable articles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have to expect that anyone who disagrees with you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpret this in the worst possible way.  Were we all on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same wavelength, then perhaps disclaimers like &quot;of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals (or their parents) would be the ones authorizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such removal&quot; wouldn't be necessary.  But they are here.
</em><br>
<p>Well, people usually volunteer themselves (with or without their parents'
<br>
permission) to have warts or tumors removed. So, I just took it for granted
<br>
that this side of the issue would obtain. I see what you mean, though. If
<br>
they're crazy enough to self-identify as religionists, they'd probably want to
<br>
keep their warts and tumors... Christian Scientists and so forth...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How can you be so sure?  I'll be really impressed if you turn out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be right, but in the mean time, what are the signs that M. E.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Smith doesn't just have an honest difference of opinion?
</em><br>
<p>1. Bringing in &quot;economic systems&quot; and implying that to be against religiosity
<br>
extends to being against them as well.
<br>
2. Stating that I proposed to &quot;attack&quot; things other than religiosity, even
<br>
though I never even proposed to attack religiosity, never mind anything else.
<br>
(Debunk does not equate to attack.)
<br>
3. Lying about what I had identified as a justifiable target for debunking,
<br>
and conflating it with something entirely different.
<br>
<p>You'll know that I'm right when this one does not de-lurk to demonstrate a
<br>
difference of opinion rather than an intention to disrupt or proselytize or
<br>
waste the list's time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Probably the writer was merely over-reacting to some of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongly worded statements (some of which really ought to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been qualified, like I said).  Still, the writer is entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unjustified to state that you (or anyone else here) favors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violent suppression of religion.  At most he could have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertain, and so should have inquired as to what you meant.
</em><br>
<p>You're right, of course. If you and I had collaborated on a response it would
<br>
have turned out differently. Qualified statements resemble pulled punches in a
<br>
way, and I didn't feel in the mood to play that game. Who wants a qualified
<br>
debunking? Let's make it decisive. Backfired.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What do you mean by rant?  I thought that a rant was a lengthy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly charged emotional attack on someone or something.  Quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frankly, what you've written is closer to a rant (well, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that &quot;rant&quot; means) than what Smith wrote.
</em><br>
<p>Right again, I should have written &quot;outburst&quot; or something similar. I was
<br>
trying to call attention to the CAPITAL LETTERS shouted in that paragraph.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If that's what people are doing, then I couldn't agree with you more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have too much of a tendency in this society to excuse behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once we understand it.
</em><br>
<p>Isn't that bizarre? Someone murders their five children, and the media say,
<br>
OK, it was post partum depression, happens all the time, lets find a counselor
<br>
for the grieving parent. Someone else has an unexplained relationship with a
<br>
missing White House intern, and the media are poised to string 'im up. Oh,
<br>
well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again, how the devil do you know that it was deliberate?  Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather, was a deliberate trick?  Couldn't it have been just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; erroneous views coupled with misunderstanding?  Or am I being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naive?
</em><br>
<p>No, you're not being naive, and on second thought, it would have been
<br>
awesomely more effective to give my adversary the benefit of whatever doubt
<br>
may have been possible. Debaters who manage to do this get my highest regard
<br>
(contingent on the ligitimacy of their position, of course).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Many things besides weakness cause over-reaction and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defensiveness, e.g., (1) fear of ridicule (2) fear of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being shouted down [yes, ridiculous on an email list,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but nonetheless a real feeling]  (3) anger at having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been insulted or made light of  (4) impatience or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frustration at unexpected opposition or argument  (5)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inarticulateness.
</em><br>
<p>Damn, you're good. I'm taking notes. Besides alluding to weakness, I could
<br>
have asked which of these (fear, anger, impatience, frustration, or
<br>
iarticulateness) could explain the previously mentioned over-reaction and
<br>
defensiveness. That sounds more potent than a mere accusation of weakness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Talk about over-reaction!  Or do you have a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous experience with Mr. (or Ms.) Smith?
</em><br>
<p>I've a lot of previous experience with over-reaction, but don't want to talk
<br>
about Smith anymore.
