<em>&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Mitchell, Jerry (3337)&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:Jerry.Mitchell@esavio.com?Subject=RE:%20Vicious%20Racism%20was%20RE:%20Reparations&In-Reply-To=&lt;9D167F53998DD411805700D0B776468F01F9A111@zeus.esavio.com&gt;">Jerry.Mitchell@esavio.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;If your going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;use the word racist, please have the common courtesy to know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what it means,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and how it differs from bigoted and discriminatory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If your bigotry and/or discrimination are directed at another 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based upon 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that other's race, you are a racist, no?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>If bigotry and discrimination are directed at a person of another race, it
<br>
MAY be indicative of racism. It may be directed at a cultural attribute as
<br>
well. If there's a disproportional amount of crime for blacks, it doesn't
<br>
mean that blacks are genetically disposed to criminal behavior. This is
<br>
probably caused by cultural factors. So now you end up blacks being watched
<br>
like a hawk as they walk around stores by people expecting them to shoplift.
<br>
Are the people discriminating? Yes. Are they being racist? No.
<br>
<p>Racism is the belief that one race is genetically superior, and I for one
<br>
don't think I am genetically superior (white male), but I do think that
<br>
black culture (specifically urban black culture) has problems. If you
<br>
provide any commentary on a cultural attribute on another race, it might be
<br>
twisted to appear as though its an attack on genetic composition , which it
<br>
isn't. Then wait and you'll hear screams of racism everywhere, and no
<br>
cultural problem will ever be able to be discussed or solved. Try and keep
<br>
culture and genetic issues separate is all I'm trying to get across. Keeping
<br>
concepts clear is important. When you get into very emotional issues like
<br>
these, its even more important.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;P.S. Another pet peeve of mine is there is no such word as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Disrepecting&quot;!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Webster would be rolling over in his grave :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While the English professor hats are on the table, one of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *my* pet peeves is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use of the possesive pronoun &quot;your&quot; in place of the correct 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conraction for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the phrase &quot;you are.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>While I'll admit to not having perfect grammar, at least I'm not inventing
<br>
words! I looked it up and it looks like my usage falls into category 3. But
<br>
thanks for the clarification on my informal use.
<br>
P.S. Its possessive... not possesive, also contraction instead of conraction
<br>
although this one looked like a typo.	
<br>
<p>your (yr, yôr, yr; yr when unstressed)
<br>
adj. The possessive form of you. 
<br>
1. Used as a modifier before a noun: your boots; your accomplishments. 
<br>
2. A person's; one's: The light switch is on your right. 
<br>
3. Informal. Used with little or no sense of possession to indicate a type
<br>
familiar to the listener: your basic three-story frame house.
