Gordon posted a link to this interview (in 25 August 2001 New Scientist), but I
<br>
thought it worth posting to the list in full. This guy's book is either going to
<br>
be very important or the sort of crank science opus you just don't get any more.
<br>
Any bets?

Principia Mathematica III 
<br>
<p>He was a child prodigy, publishing his first paper at 15. Now Stephen Wolfram
<br>
says he has created a new kind of science based on simple computer programs
<br>
rather than equations. It's a bold claim, but it has taken him 20 years--ten of
<br>
them thinking and working late into the night, and publishing nothing. By a nice
<br>
irony, that intellectual space was bought by the millions he made out of
<br>
Mathematica, a computer program that makes complicated mathematics doable for
<br>
ordinary mortals. Now, at 41, he's busy gearing himself up for the glare of
<br>
publicity as he prepares to publish the fruit of all those years. Marcus Chown
<br>
caught up with Wolfram--at 3 am 
<br>
<p><p><p>Are you the Isaac Newton of the 21st century? 
<br>
<p><p>Who knows? I think I've discovered some big and important things. But I'm more
<br>
interested in what I've discovered than where it puts me in the world. Sometimes
<br>
I think I might be happier just to figure things out and keep them to myself.
<br>
I've put a lot of effort into getting ready to share them. And if people
<br>
actually start to understand what I've figured out, then I think I'll be forced
<br>
to be a very famous scientist. I have mixed feelings about that. But I think
<br>
it's important to the ideas that I don't try to avoid it too much. 
<br>
<p><p>What's the story behind this new kind of science? How did it all begin? 
<br>
<p><p>Around 1980, I had become interested in several really different
<br>
questions--galaxy formation and how brains work. They all seemed to be getting
<br>
stuck in the same kind of way. I began to realise that the real problem was with
<br>
the basic infrastructure of science. For about 300 years, most of science has
<br>
been dominated by the idea of using mathematical equations to model nature. That
<br>
worked really well for Newton and friends, figuring out orbits of planets and
<br>
things, but it's never really worked with more complicated phenomena in physics,
<br>
such as fluid turbulence. And in biology it's been pretty hopeless. 
<br>
<p><p>If equations aren't the right infrastructure for modelling the world, what is? 
<br>
<p><p>Simple programs. If you're going to be able to make scientific theories at all,
<br>
systems in nature had better follow definite rules. But why should those rules
<br>
be based on the constructs of human mathematics? In the past, there wasn't any
<br>
framework for thinking about more general kinds of rules. But now you can think
<br>
of them as being like computer programs. About 20 years ago, I decided to try to
<br>
work out what kind of science you could build from these more general kinds of
<br>
rules. The first big question was what do these rules typically do? What do
<br>
simple programs typically do? 
<br>
<p><p>Did you carry out experiments to find out? 
<br>
<p><p>Yes. I started with very simple programs called cellular automata. The version
<br>
that I used began with a row of cells, each either black or white. Then you make
<br>
a new row underneath. You use a definite rule to work out the colour of each
<br>
cell, by looking at the colours of its neighbours on the row above. And then you
<br>
repeat this over and over again. It's a simple set-up. There are just 256 of
<br>
these kinds of programs. The question is what happens when you run them, say
<br>
just starting with a single black cell. You would guess it should always be
<br>
something simple. The remarkable thing I discovered--almost 20 years ago--is
<br>
that this intuition is completely wrong. You see, of the 256 possible cellular
<br>
automata, several make incredibly complicated patterns that look almost
<br>
completely random and that you'd never imagine came just from repeatedly
<br>
applying a simple rule to a single black square. 
<br>
<p><p>So your experiments convinced you that nature uses simple programs to generate
<br>
the complexity we see around us... 
<br>
<p><p>Yes, I think it's the main secret of nature. It's what lets nature come up with
<br>
things that look so much more complex than anything we've been able to invent
<br>
does. Some people say complexity in biology can't just be coming from natural
<br>
selection. They're right, but the point is that nature uses tools we didn't
<br>
expect. That's what I've discovered. 
<br>
<p><p>How did you follow up on this? 
<br>
<p><p>I worked out lots of details and published lots of papers. And I got lots of
<br>
other people interested. The whole topic of complexity got very popular. I even
<br>
began a journal and a research centre. But people understood only part of what
<br>
I'd done. The rest required a big conceptual leap. And if you want to pursue
<br>
those things, history says you pretty much have to go it alone. 
<br>
<p><p>And a new science needs a new tool--was that why you invented Mathematica? 
<br>
<p><p>Partly. I needed to be able to build programs then find out what they do as
<br>
efficiently as possible. It required big new ideas about setting up software
<br>
systems to do that. It turned out that the very fact that I could figure out how
<br>
to build all the complexity of Mathematica from quite simple &quot;primitives&quot; was an
<br>
important inspiration. It made me realise that I might work out what primitives
<br>
nature uses for its rules. So Mathematica was both a tool and an inspiration. 
<br>
<p><p>What exactly does Mathematica do? 
<br>
<p><p>It's a complete environment for technical computing. It lets people do a huge
<br>
range of calculations, and creates graphics and documents, interacts with the
<br>
Web, and so on. It's all based on a language that lets you build complex
<br>
programs far more easily than before. A few million people use it. 
<br>
<p><p>Did that make you a multimillionaire? 
<br>
<p><p>Yes, I've made a lot of money, but I've always wanted to put my energies into
<br>
the things that I find most interesting. What motivates me most is discovering
<br>
new things and building new ideas. 
<br>
<p><p>Tell me about your 10 years of silence... 
<br>
<p><p>It began in 1991 after I'd built up a terrific team at my company. I began to
<br>
split my time between management and basic science. I wanted to finish building
<br>
the new kind of science I'd begun in the early 1980s. I had no idea it would
<br>
take so long. I kept on discovering more and more things. Every time I turned
<br>
over a rock there was a huge new universe underneath. It's been exciting, but
<br>
there's been a huge amount to do and it's taken immense focus to get it all
<br>
done. I always used to like lecturing and travelling, but to get this project
<br>
done, I've had to shut those kinds of things down. 
<br>
<p><p>And talking to journalists? 
<br>
<p><p>Right. I'm going to have to get used to that again now. 
<br>
<p><p>So, what have you discovered? 
<br>
<p><p>Enough to fill hundreds--maybe thousands--of scientific papers. I've amassed a
<br>
huge amount of evidence for my idea that simple programs--like the cellular
<br>
automata--are the key to lots of important phenomena in nature. In physics, for
<br>
instance, I can finally explain why the second law of thermodynamics works--that
<br>
is, why many physical systems tend to become irreversibly more random as time
<br>
progresses. In biology, I now know how a lot of the complexity arises. I've
<br>
discovered that many things we might have thought were special about life and
<br>
intelligence, for example, can also emerge in all kinds of physical systems.
<br>
Consequently, I don't believe &quot;anthropic&quot; arguments that say that for us to be
<br>
here it's necessary for there to be stars, galaxies and so on. There can be
<br>
things just as complex as us without any of that. 
<br>
<p><p>Why haven't you published any of this? 
<br>
<p><p>Because it's all part of a big picture that can be communicated properly only by
<br>
showing everything together. I guess if someone else had been paying for my
<br>
work, I might have had to give progress reports. Fortunately, I've been able to
<br>
concentrate on putting everything together in a nice coherent way, as a book
<br>
called A New Kind of Science. It's been a huge project. I've devoted about 100
<br>
million keystrokes to it. I've taken a lot of trouble to polish my ideas so
<br>
they're as clean as possible. Usually, new directions in science begin far more
<br>
gradually, with lots of people involved. But the things I'm doing now are
<br>
different enough that I've had to build up a whole new intellectual structure by
<br>
myself. 
<br>
<p><p>Who's the book aimed at? 
<br>
<p><p>Everyone. It's completely new so there aren't any specialists. It may turn out
<br>
that people who have good intellectual discipline but perhaps don't know so much
<br>
about science will have an easier time. 
<br>
<p><p>Have you discovered the simple program that is generating the Universe? 
<br>
<p><p>Not yet. But I have found increasing evidence that it exists. It could be as
<br>
simple as a few lines of Mathematica code. I think before too many years it'll
<br>
be possible to find it. 
<br>
<p><p>So is Stephen Hawking right about scientists being close to discovering a
<br>
&quot;theory of everything&quot;? 
<br>
<p><p>Well, the things I've been thinking about are very, very different from the
<br>
usual quantum field theory and string theory approach. There's some very basic
<br>
intuition that's different when you think about simple programs instead of
<br>
equations and so on. One big issue is that getting a fundamental theory of
<br>
physics doesn't mean physics is finished. That'd be like saying that computing
<br>
is finished once you have a computer. Suppose that the program for the Universe
<br>
is four lines long. There's no room in those four lines to put in all the
<br>
familiar stuff we know about space-time having four dimensions, the muon being
<br>
206 times the mass of the electron, and so on. Almost nothing from the everyday
<br>
world will be obvious in the program. These things will have to emerge when the
<br>
program runs. Figuring out how that works, and exactly what can emerge, can be
<br>
arbitrarily difficult. 
<br>
<p><p>Could it be that the Universe-generating program will only produce what we see
<br>
around us after it's run for 13 billion years? 
<br>
<p><p>Yes, I think that will be partly true. But even though the evolution of the
<br>
Universe as a whole may be what I call computationally irreducible, there will
<br>
still be patches that are reducible--where we can figure what the Universe does
<br>
faster than it does it. And actually almost all of what traditional
<br>
equation-based science has been doing is looking just at those computationally
<br>
reducible parts. 
<br>
<p><p>So there's no mystery in Einstein's famous observation that the most
<br>
incomprehensible thing about the Universe is that it's comprehensible? 
<br>
<p><p>Well, I think that's really much more a statement about the practice of science
<br>
than about our Universe. One of the clear lessons from history is that fields of
<br>
science tend to get defined according to whatever their methods allow them to
<br>
study successfully. What I've discovered is that there's lots of other stuff out
<br>
there that you can see if you think in terms of programs. 
<br>
<p><p>So if the Babylonians had invented computer programs before geometry, might
<br>
science have been more effective? 
<br>
<p><p>Well, quite a bit of what I've discovered could have been found by the
<br>
Babylonians. If you know what to look for, you could just find it by arranging
<br>
pebbles with a simple rule. Young kids today could certainly do it. If my kind
<br>
of science had been around for ages, perhaps only now would a Newton have
<br>
invented calculus.
