I only wish I was a rich lawyer or a corporate fat cat who sends my kids off 
<br>
to private school. I should be so lucky :-)  On the other hand, the 
<br>
moralizing media who demands (between their peddling of steel belted radial 
<br>
tires and deodorant tampons) that we snap to attention, of their litany of 
<br>
woes, that they constantly bombard us with, wonder why people have become 
<br>
selective viewers/listeners. Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh!  NPR is no different.  
<br>
<p>Imagine that I have a pad of paper and on each pad I have written down a 
<br>
problem or article of interest. You, as the kindly viewer/listener must 
<br>
resolve these problems or issues. Here, I am starting off, then the next one 
<br>
here's another one, and another, and another, come on, fix it! Here's 
<br>
another, and so on, and so forth, have you fixed it yet? How about now? 
<br>
Here's another, and another, is it fixed yet? Did you solve it? How about 
<br>
now?...and so forth..ad naseum.

<p>Hippie Dippyism failed in large part because it had no economic standing, 
<br>
nothing to support it, that was independent of the national lifestyle. Rudy 
<br>
Rucker (computer scientist &amp; author) called it &quot;the Bohemian Lifestyle&quot; 
<br>
referring to the 19th century French vernacular. My point is that not all 
<br>
became Yuppies, or were Hippies, and that NPR paints with the broadest brush, 
<br>
and in garish tones-so be careful how they present the world, because in my 
<br>
opinion  NPR is a leftist-liberal crock-pot, and as a former leftist liberal, 
<br>
let me tell ya, they suck casaba melons.  
<br>
<p>Neither are all Generation X-er's slackers (I hate that term) or 
<br>
techno-nerds, or whatever.  Journalists are a cynical lot who have less of a 
<br>
need (most Journalists fit this!) to get their stories done with accuracy, 
<br>
and perspective, then to have it done Thursday.  Stylesheets are now the rage 
<br>
in all forms of news reporting (words that are always used, phrases etc.), so 
<br>
the range of independent thinking is always kept limited. Welcome to Orwell 
<br>
country, a self-imposed censorship-apparently.

<p>&lt;&lt; Funny, just today (um, or was it yesterday?) I was listening to a show on 
<br>
NPR about baby boomers.  Apparently your sort of idealogical conversion is 
<br>
endemic among the boomers.  The same hippies who once marched on Washington  
<br>
in protest of racial segregation are now lawyers and corporate fat cats who  
<br>
send their kids to exclusive (read: all-white) private schools.

&nbsp;Apparently its a lot harder to be a rich liberal than a poor conservative ;)
