<p>Actually, it's a bit more than that.  Identical twins raised 
<br>
separately are, in some ways, more different than when raised 
<br>
together.  It's as if it's important to differentiate oneself from 
<br>
one's environment.  I presume that the same would be true of other 
<br>
groupings.  Perhaps one could find two close high schools, with 
<br>
(initially) essentially identical student bodies, and see whether 
<br>
or not they differentiated themselves.  
<br>
<p>I know I've seen it happen at least once, when a new high school 
<br>
opened, and the student body of the old high school was, 
<br>
essentially arbitrarily, assigned to one high school or the other.  
<br>
One high school quickly became more achievement oriented than the 
<br>
other, and from an originally homogeneous student body, two 
<br>
distinct populations emerged.  This nearly has to be developmental, 
<br>
and it certainly isn't anything that anyone was consciously 
<br>
intending. 
<br>
<p>One case isn't much evidence, and most of the rest is less 
<br>
objective, but I have a hypothesis that much of the split in 
<br>
development between human groups is each group moving into a less 
<br>
occupied niche, and then developing to fit into that niche more 
<br>
accurately.  So we have some populations of people moving towards 
<br>
the K strategy and others toward the R strategy.  (I think that 
<br>
stands for carnivor and ruminant, but I sure wouldn't swear to it.  
<br>
Anyway, K strategists emphasise investment in a small number of 
<br>
offspring and R strategists emphasise more nearly maximizing the 
<br>
number of offspring, and a reduced investment in each of them.)  
<br>
Different populations fit into different niches more successfully.  
<br>
And no difference in the genetic composition of the populations 
<br>
need be hypothesized (though one would certainly develop, given 
<br>
enough generations).
<br>
<p>This adaptation allows essentially identical genotypes to develop 
<br>
in ways that take maximal advantage of a large number of divergent 
<br>
niches.  And given the rate of human cross-breeding between 
<br>
populations, one would not expect any marked genetic divergence to 
<br>
occur.  (Climatic adaptations are less subject to this kind of 
<br>
drift, as they are less malleable under developmental conditions.)
