</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Folks, we _need_ those anti-ageing treatments. Badly!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right! we need to be able to keep working and working even as we get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; older and older.  I want to live forever so I can keep going to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; office and working and working....
</em><br>
<p>Frankly, I do.  Of course, my &quot;office&quot; probably varies from what you're
<br>
thinking of: the office of a freelancer, or maybe a CEO, helping to
<br>
make various good things available to the public.  Right now it's
<br>
relatively mundane improvements to various Web services, but perhaps in
<br>
a decade or two it'll be upgraded AI modules, or maybe nanoassemblers.
<br>
Several decades after that, possibly it'll be helping to design the
<br>
local Dyson sphere, or maybe we'll have enough energy available that
<br>
development can begin on one of those stardrives that are currently
<br>
only theoretical because they need so much power...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This article, the assumption made by its author, and your response to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, exemplify very well common misconceptions about economics made by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the media.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I don't have much time to make my arguments ( I have to go to work!),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I'll simply point out that the assumptions made by the author make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfect sense if the country of Japan were a business entity owned by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the author.  However, the company of Japan is a business owned by its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens. The same concept applies to all western democracies, and all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a *crucial* difference!
</em><br>
<p>Regardless of who owns the nation-company, *someone* has to do the
<br>
work, making sure food gets to mouths, keeping up whatever
<br>
infrastructure is desired (like power/phone lines and roads), coming up
<br>
with ways to improve everyone's lives (like researching further
<br>
anti-aging treatments), and so on.  AIs, immigrants, non-retired
<br>
de-aged centenarians...any labor source will do, but the traditional
<br>
source of native youth is not as plentiful as it once was.
