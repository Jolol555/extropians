<p>I'd be willing to bet that IQ is predictive of whether
<br>
or not a person subscribes to this list...
<br>
<p>A small percentage of people with IQs of over 120 will
<br>
join.  A very much smaller(orders of magnitude)
<br>
percentage of people with IQs of 100-120 will join. 
<br>
No people with IQs between 80-100 will join and if
<br>
anyone with an IQ of less than 80 joins I'll climb a
<br>
transmission tower next to I5 and juggle fire clubs
<br>
topless (Oh wait, somebody already did that.  I wonder
<br>
what bet she lost.)
<br>
<p>Actually... all of this &quot;IQ tests only measure IQ test
<br>
taking skills&quot; sounds remarkably like many other
<br>
current common sense beliefs that are equally wrong.
<br>
<p>The story about the illiterate millionaire is just
<br>
that... a story. Remember it came from the same place
<br>
that brings you UFO sightings and such. If it happened
<br>
at all, the kid wasn't low IQ, but may have had a
<br>
learning disorder that he overcame when he got older. 
<br>
But it sounds too much like any of a thousand such
<br>
stories.  It's just too pat... and proves the intended
<br>
point too well to be real.
<br>
<p>IQ tests may not be perfect... we may be unclear on
<br>
exactly what it is we are measuring... but they ARE
<br>
measuring something real.  You can guess a persons IQ
<br>
within 10 points easily after talking with them for
<br>
just a few minutes.
<br>
<p>And while not all folks who have high IQs succeed in
<br>
life (problem being maybe with our definition of
<br>
&quot;success&quot;?),  take the average IQ in a corporate board
<br>
room or a faculty lounge at a university and compare
<br>
them to the line worker's lunch room at a factory and
<br>
I'll bet they are markedly different.
<br>
<p>Like many thing human, IQ isn't a good predictor of
<br>
individual accomplishment, but it works great for
<br>
large groups.
<br>
