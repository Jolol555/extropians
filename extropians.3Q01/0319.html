<p>
Reason, I take it that the first set of guidelines are
<br>
things you are already doing along the same lines, so
<br>
I won't relist those, but I would like to address how
<br>
we can all help:
<br>
<p>1) donate content: 
<br>
<p>By donating content, you mean content from people like
<br>
Pearson and Shaw (is this what you mean by
<br>
accredited), or lay people like me who use the
<br>
life-extension &quot;supplements,&quot; or both?
<br>
<p>The reason I ask is I have just been assigned an
<br>
editorial position for a &quot;supplement&quot; company in the
<br>
UK (so much for just being a violin teacher), and this
<br>
is read by several people in the medical industry
<br>
there, and probably by some life extension researchers
<br>
as well. I may have access to content on all sides of
<br>
the issue--research, 'scripts, government, laws,
<br>
consumers.
<br>
<p>2) find me a friendly, helpful life-extensionist
<br>
California lawyer 
<br>
<p>May take some doing, but my man used to be a corporate
<br>
lawyer in Calif. and I will see if I can get some
<br>
names. He thinks old people are a burden on society,
<br>
though, and is somewhat anti-life extension. Anyone
<br>
who could provide me with links/info to combat that
<br>
attitude, please do--he is incredibly intelligent and
<br>
will understand.
<br>
<p>Is there a chace you or someone else could do the
<br>
legal research instead of using non-profit advice?
<br>
Access to a law library is about all that would be
<br>
necessary. I realize ancient English is difficult at
<br>
best to understand, but not impossible.
<br>
<p>Aren't there others on this list with good legal
<br>
resources?
<br>
<p>3) assist on the technical side -- site building, etc.
<br>
<p>There are many people who would love to do this, I
<br>
bet. A lot of them are out of jobs with the failure of
<br>
tech industry stocks, dot-coms and such (a lot are my
<br>
friends) and are freelancing and moonlighting at very
<br>
low rates. California is probably full of them.
<br>
<p>Nontraditional students (who are sometimes into their
<br>
30s and comparing themselves to the smooth-faced high
<br>
school set they attend class with) could be a
<br>
wonderfully sympathetic source of this--local
<br>
colleges, even tech colleges, art schools (web
<br>
designers), etc.
<br>
<p>4) participate in the community! 
<br>
<p>So many facets of this. Subgroups of a parent group
<br>
for the sake of organization and expediency?
<br>
<p>As you mentioned the word &quot;grassroots,&quot; I guess this
<br>
is where the grass gets planted. Choosing
<br>
representatives is important here. Community
<br>
involvement--I can see it now. I, a 44 year old music
<br>
teacher, reach out into a community of people who are
<br>
my age, look it and act it (I do not). I would be a
<br>
good advertisement for life extension, because I am a
<br>
living example of the quality-of-life issue that some
<br>
will take exception to: I will have many more years of
<br>
productive life ahead of me, as opposed to sitting on
<br>
my can collecting Soc Security for thirty years longer
<br>
than I should. It is obvious by my looks, attitude and
<br>
prospects for the future. I can do anything I want and
<br>
I know it.
<br>
<p>5) be cheerleaders; advocate, get your friends to
<br>
visit the site, tell
<br>
everyone you know.
<br>
<p>Important point. Purchase email lists from others? I
<br>
know I get on people's email lists and get told I
<br>
signed up for this newsletter or that quote-of-the-day
<br>
when I did no such thing. I don't get irritated
<br>
because I have found some VERY good sources of
<br>
what-not out there because of it.
<br>
<p>Email lists could be gotten from the companies that
<br>
supply antiaging supplements, etc.
<br>
<p>As far as the list coordinating efforts, it sounds
<br>
like most of them are involved in many things, so I
<br>
don't know if it could be a fulltime job for anyone,
<br>
really. But if everyone could allocate two hours per
<br>
week that's a lot of manhours dedicated.
<br>
<p>You said a list is a bad way to coordinate more than
<br>
one topic at a time, but isn't the singluar topic
<br>
support of antiaging research and putting the screws
<br>
to governments to let it happen? Sounds pretty
<br>
specific.
<br>
<p>Yes, Reason, our lives would get extended, too, you
<br>
are right. And possibly more so than most others
<br>
because--and this is just opinion mentally supported
<br>
by word of mouth--philanthropists (which I see
<br>
transhumanists are the cream of) have the joy of
<br>
helping others instead of letting god sort it out. I
<br>
read years ago that it is like petting animals, the
<br>
more you do the more it extends your life and quality
<br>
of it.
<br>
<p>So there. :) Ha! If these are things you are looking
<br>
for to start or promote what you are doing, please
<br>
consider me a capable ally and feel free to send me a
<br>
private email about it. This goes for anyone out
<br>
there.
