<em>&gt; &gt; SDI is the only moral option for a libertarian society based on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; premise of not initiating violence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It might be the only moral option if it were plausibly shown to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workable.  At this point it is still mostly a massive costly boondoggle in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the making.  The research done by Dave Redell of CPSR on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (in)feasibility of building software that would achieve the necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims of the SDI project are still the best reference on this subject.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not being able to shoot a single missle out of the air in a fair trial is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one problem, but they also have to get their software to work correctly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every time in the first battle, without any reasonable arena for evolving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it into robustness beforehand.
</em><br>
<p>The requirements for the SDI system are, according to the estmates for
<br>
the numbers of lines of code, fully within today's capability, as every
<br>
major operating sytem runs with more lines of code today. What is
<br>
illuminating is that every time industry capabilities reach the alleged
<br>
amount of code SDI's detractors claim is necessary, they move the mark.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To the extent that government spending on defense is defensible, I wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind them continuing to spend money on research, but to talk about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deployment is outrageous.
</em><br>
<p>Which is why deployment is being deferred for more research with other
<br>
systems.
