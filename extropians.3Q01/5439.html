<em>&gt; &quot;The World's Smallest Political Quiz&quot; at <a href="http://www.self-gov.org/quiz.html">http://www.self-gov.org/quiz.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems pretty unbiased to me.  Of the ten questions, only two are even a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little bit begging for certain answers or make assertions.  Can you tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me what questions you have a problem with?
</em><br>
<p>Okay ...
<br>
<p>&quot;Government should not control radio, TV, the press or the Internet.&quot; This
<br>
is going to go down well with anyone who's grown up with the BBC -- not.
<br>
<p>That's the only obviously biased one in the &quot;personal issues&quot; section,
<br>
except that I should note that you'll find fragments of agreement with
<br>
all of these -- and disagreement with others -- scattered across all parts
<br>
ofthe political spectrum in the UK. For example, conservatives here will
<br>
_not_ agree with the proposition in question #5 (&quot;People should be free
<br>
to come and go across borders; to live and work where they choose&quot;) --
<br>
it implies free immigration, and that's a hot button issue.
<br>
<p>Section #2 is where the real bias cuts in. Everything is phrased in terms
<br>
of free trade orthodoxy; this is _not_ generally accepted in the UK,
<br>
where a majority of the public (as of the last polls) would be happy to
<br>
pay more tax in return for better services, and where the NHS is a holy
<br>
cow that not even the most extreme free marketeer conservatives are
<br>
willing to criticize.
<br>
<p>Oh, and my girlfriend just pointed out that there are _no_ environmental
<br>
issues in the quiz -- none whatsoever. Even if it's just a question 
<br>
about the ownership of the commons, or how to regulate pollution.
<br>
<p>Basically, there's a perception I've noticed among Americans on usenet
<br>
that their government is an alien intrusion on their personal liberties.
<br>
This perception is not shared by most other cultures, and section #2
<br>
of the quiz takes an &quot;us or them&quot; approach to government funding/no
<br>
government funding that looks blatantly biased to non-American eyes.
<br>
<p>Put it another way: I know ONE Brit who'd click &quot;Y&quot; on every question.
<br>
He's a libertarian, and proud of it. He's also an annoying bastard, and
<br>
most of us who drink with him regularly suspect his real motive is to
<br>
annoy the hell out of everybody. (He comes from a long line of contrarian
<br>
troublemakers -- his father was apparently kicked out of every club and
<br>
membership association in his home town, _twice_.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Naah. This quiz doesn't actually imply that the people who set it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; support these positions; it's designed to establish whether you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the person who's sitting the quiz, supports those positions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought it obvious the mind-set of whoever wrote that test.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or she is clearly left-liberal.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
You fail to consider the possibility that the mainstream in the UK
<br>
is, by your lights, left-liberal. It's the same with the world's
<br>
smallest political quiz; you think it's neutral, but you come from
<br>
a country where the *default* setting is right-wing pro-business. The
<br>
real question that the WSPQ is asking is _not_ &quot;are you pro or anti
<br>
capitalism&quot;, it's &quot;are you for small, independent businesses or big
<br>
monolithic government pork-barrel projects&quot;. There's no room to
<br>
say &quot;I am a communist!&quot; or &quot;I am a syndicalist and I believe in
<br>
abolishing money!&quot; in this quiz. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now it *IS* true that in *some* ideologies, vanilla discourse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is itself to be criticized.  Marxist rhetoric is unmistakeable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it's instantly obvious that someone *is not* a Marxist if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most sentences fail to have certain loaded words and phrases.
</em><br>
<p>Those &quot;loaded terms&quot; as you describe them can also be described as
<br>
terms that have well-defined meanings, within the ideology in question.
<br>
If I start calling &quot;libertarians&quot; &quot;liberals&quot; this might confuse you,
<br>
no?
<br>
<p>[ snip ]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; In other words, what is really scary is when even slight injustices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; aren't confessed as such when they are in the service of ideology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; It's another case of the good ends justifying the not-so-good means.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Eh? I don't follow you. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have reason to believe that the following does not fit *you* (especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since looking at your own quiz).  Quite a number of people in the 20th
</em><br>
<em>&gt; century, while they wouldn't come directly out and say so in so many words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truly believe that lying or stealing for progressive causes is justified.
</em><br>
<p>Depends what the &quot;progressive cause&quot; is, in my opinion -- and on the
<br>
nature of the theft or lie. I won't rule it out, personally. If you
<br>
think this is extreme, contemplate the behaviour of many self-proclaimed
<br>
libertarians on the &quot;information wants to be free&quot; front, specifically
<br>
with respect to circumvention of the DMCA. (Ack, spit.)
<br>
<p>Personally, I'd go so far as to say that I won't steal property
<br>
that I recognize from people I respect without what I consider to be
<br>
an overridingly important reason, and I don't consider ideological
<br>
disputes to be acceptable justification for violence or lawbreaking --
<br>
unless they've been escalated to the point of violence by the other guy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another factor that breaks the left/right symmetry (at least in American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politics) is that conservatives are viewed as evil by the left, whereas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberals are viewed as wrong or stupid by the right.  I've lost track of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the number of times that I *myself* have been accused on this very list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;having no compassion&quot;, or suffering from some other similar character
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flaw.  Conservatives are viewed by American liberals (in many cases) as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *morally* deficient; corporation executives are honestly thought to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monsters;  what tactics aren't justified when you're fighting evil?
</em><br>
<p>I suspect the phenomenon is something else; everybody believes they're
<br>
correct -- if you don't, you're a hypocrite or need to get a new belief
<br>
system _fast_ -- and we can justify this either by ratiocination against
<br>
contrary beliefs, or by emotional response. The rationalist reaction
<br>
is to say &quot;they're wrong&quot;, then proceed to fabricate after-the-fact
<br>
justifications to back up this assertion. The emotionalist reaction
<br>
is to say &quot;they're evil&quot;, which needs rather less justification to back
<br>
up.
<br>
<p>*Both* these attitudes are wrong-headed, IMO ;-)
