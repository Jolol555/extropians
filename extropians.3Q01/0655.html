From: &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Kosko%20on%20AI%20in%20L.A.%20Times&In-Reply-To=&lt;015901c1090f$440ac340$9e5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">hal@finney.org</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Of course he is glossing over the tremendous difficulties involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in interfacing a chip to the brain in such a way that it can provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningful information, especially if it is going to extend our memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so that chip-based memories and data &quot;feel&quot; normal.
</em><br>
<p>You've cut right to the central issue here. (Unless I overestimate your
<br>
incisiveness because it coincides with my own take on this subject. ©¿©¬ )
<br>
After puzzling over the application of neuromorphic retinas to the art of
<br>
inloading, the difficulty of the bidirectional interface had impressed me more
<br>
than Kosko's hyperbole. What makes it so difficult is that neither Kosko nor
<br>
anyone else knows how brain architecture produces computation and pattern
<br>
recognition, not to mention higher cognitive functions. (When Anders Sandberg
<br>
figures it out, he can charge a bundle for it.) So, the connection isn't such
<br>
a puzzle; it's translating the data... like shuttling information between
<br>
dissimilar computer platforms without knowing how either of them works, only
<br>
much more complicated.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; While I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can understand that presenting the idea of uploading would undercut the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attractive picture he is painting, it's confusing at the end as we picture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our bodies standing around frozen while our minds zoom off into infinity.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like an OBE (out of body experience) on the Art Bell show. But it's
<br>
even more alien than that, because the concept &quot;zoom off into infinity&quot; needs
<br>
to be translated into machine language so that there is correspondence which
<br>
allows this picture to have meaning. I wonder if successful
<br>
uploading/inloading will require engineers to comprehend the vast difference
<br>
between inorganic versus organic computation. If it does, these guys are going
<br>
to have to be smarter than Kosko and Kurzweil combined.
<br>
<p>BTW, have you heard of &quot;K-base artificial intelligence&quot;? I read a transcript
<br>
of a TV show that mentioned it. Here it is:
<br>
<p>WNYW 7/7/01 - 1:13 AM... Well, um, it's simple, really. It comes down to
<br>
failure--mine. I've sunk an enormous amount of r&amp;d into the project, and so
<br>
far-- so far it hasn't produced the breakthrough we 'd hoped for. Could you
<br>
give me a quick summary again of the, uh, the project? Of course. The
<br>
project is an attempt to produce artificial intelligence using the process of
<br>
k-base. K-base? The best way to understand k-base is to imagine chaos theory
<br>
in a multidimensional arena. Ok, so whatever this is you're talking about,
<br>
it's some sort of supercomputer. No, no. Not at all. It's not a computer. It
<br>
would have existed in the world of computers in the same way that we exist in
<br>
the world of oxygen, but it would have been a fully independent entity, an
<br>
entity with the ability to think and to learn, a fully creative being. But in
<br>
a box. No, no, Mr. Aikens. We're the ones in the box. We're constrained by our
<br>
sacks of flesh. We're limited by our-- our eyes and our ears. Imagine
<br>
something different. Imagine an entity that can move at the speed of
<br>
lightning, can push its consciousness down any electronic pathway. The
<br>
internet would be its body. Its arms would reach from black river to chin...
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
