<em>&gt; Avoid war if at all possible, win it otherwise.  spike
</em><br>
<p>This answers the question accurately and concisely. It's not the best answer
<br>
nor the wittiest answer nor the most incisive answer. It's simply The Answer
<br>
to the question, and no one can improve it, but to emphasize it and to bring
<br>
attention to the fact that it is indeed the answer, I'll go on about why it's
<br>
The answer. Consonant to the way 3 is the answer to the question, &quot;what's the
<br>
square root of 9,&quot; so &quot;Avoid war if at all possible, win it otherwise&quot; is the
<br>
answer to the question, What is the Extropian answer to war?
<br>
There are good wars and bad wars; there are big wars and little wars; there
<br>
are total wars and tribal wars; there are culture wars and economic wars;
<br>
there are species wars and technological wars... There are all kinds of wars.
<br>
There are extropic wars and entropic ones too. Promoting spontaneous order in
<br>
the face of what appears to be senseless destruction presents a challenge to
<br>
brains infected with memes of politics and religion. But to the stalwart
<br>
extropian, it comes down to successful avoidance or decisive victory, pure and
<br>
clean. Thanks, spike.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
