<p>
Most of the other lists I'm on are narrowly focused, and though I get some
<br>
impression of the sort of person each poster might be, I don't feel as
<br>
though I KNOW any of them, unless I strike up an acquaintance off-list.
<br>
<p>There is, however, one other list I'm on that's as wide ranging as the
<br>
Extropians. It's a list for people (mostly ex-urbanites) who are living in
<br>
rural areas (or who aren't yet but wannabe) and are building their own
<br>
houses, growing food, and so forth. A fairly large number of them make a
<br>
living programming or designing computer software. It's interesting to note
<br>
that often when heated debates about politics are going on among the
<br>
Extropians, the Homesteaders are debating the same topics at the same time.
<br>
It's a bit uncanny (I can only suppose that certain news items trigger the
<br>
debates on both lists). I haven't been posting to the Homesteader's list
<br>
lately, so there's no way I could have carried the topics there from the
<br>
Extropian's list. The Homesteaders have just now ranged through Libertarian
<br>
versus socialist, whether welfare payments actually help people, etc. etc.
<br>
They haven't done race (yet) but they've tackled sexism. They're presently
<br>
talking about the spike and the loss of jobs that'll occur due to major
<br>
changes in technology. They take a different approach from the Extropians'
<br>
with all these topics (especially the spike), which makes it especially
<br>
interesting to flip from one list to the other.
<br>
<p>With both the Extropians and the Homestead lists, I see the regular posters
<br>
as real people, whom I feel as though I know. On both lists, when a regular
<br>
poster doesn't show up for a while, people notice and make an effort to find
<br>
out what's happened to the missing member. Although the Homestead list has
<br>
no organized events such as the EXTRO conventions, the members often have
<br>
informal regional gatherings at one of the members' farms. Most of the list
<br>
members are in the US, but there are regular posters from England, Ireland,
<br>
Australia, and Macedonia.
<br>
<p>Both the Homestead list and the Extropians list have existed since the early
<br>
days of the Internet, and on both there is a small group of original members
<br>
who are still around. Both have a core of long-term members who've been
<br>
around for a year or more and who seem to like each other enough to remain
<br>
on friendly terms even after heated debates. The Homestead list has more
<br>
women than does the Extropians, but this doesn't seem to make much
<br>
difference with respect to the frequency, anger-level, and duration of
<br>
heated debates.
