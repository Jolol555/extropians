Herb, I DID NOT say what you are quoting that I said.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I know that its the habit of a lot of people to start quoting statistics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this one. Some stats are valid, others are questionable. I ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this is something that should be defended on principle. I don't care if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; guns do cause more crime. What I do care about is my right to self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; defense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; YES.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, MORE GUNS LESS CRIME but that is -- as you say -- not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point is that WE have the right to defend our LIFE and our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LIBERTY though arms.  We have that right as long as we insist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upon that right and guard that right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Imagine a world with no guns, where intruders now break in your house
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; knives and sticks. How do you defend yourself at that point? More knives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually there is strong evidence that baring all guns successfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- which is likely impossible but assume it for a moment -- would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; INCREASE crime against individuals AND increase injuries from such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without arms in private hands, only the BANKS and other places with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MONEY can afford the &quot;armed guards&quot; and even more criminals would be pushed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of these niches to the streets where they would prey on the relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helpless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If may even be safer to robbed by an assailant with a firearm than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a stick or a knife.  With the 'less' lethal weapons the attacker
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is more likely to USE it for 'demonstation' purposes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sticks? Try and figure the odds of you winning that kind of a fight, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; average, Id say 50/50 (if there is only one of them). I have a right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; defend myself using the most powerful reasonable tools allowable (no, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; obviously don't mean nukes). When someone is in my house at night and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Guns are egalitarian.  A 90lb woman of average strength is equal to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a large, strong, and PRACTICED male assailant IF she is armed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; responsible for protecting my family (not the police, or Interpol, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whomever), you can bet Ill take maximum precautions to protect my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; family.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the United States it is a MATTER OF LAW that the police are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NOT required to protect you.  The police are charged with mainting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the PUBLIC (general) order, and finding the criminals AFTER the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In general, ONLY THE POTENTIAL victim can reliably provent the crime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Understand what I'm saying, I don't care about statistics... You can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; twist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them any which way to Sunday and so can the other side. In principle it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wrong to remove the best means of self-defense from law abiding people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; RIGHT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because even if you could manage to get the guns out of the hands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; criminals (impossible), it wouldn't change my situation of defending my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; family a whit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; RIGHT again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Here's the possibilities once again...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You have gun, intruder has gun.                       Outcome 50/50
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, I have excercised my intelligence and due diligence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PRACTICE with my firearm regularly, to ARRANGE my home to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my defensive advantage, and the intruder does NOT know my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; home or my WILLINGNESS to resist and protect my family.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You don't have gun, intruder has gun.         Outcome 5/95 your dead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Give him your stuff.  Say thank you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You don't have gun intruder doesn't have gun. Outcome 50/50
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, it is worse, once you resisst without arms, you get hurt more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than by passive resistance (on average.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You have gun, intruder doesn't have gun.              Outcome 95/5 you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; win
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He only gets the 5% if I am not doing what I am supposed to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; STAY ALERT.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So if you don't have a gun, your chances are 50/50 and 5/95 your dead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you do have gun your chances are 50/50 and 95/5 you win. Now you pick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; best chance at surviving. (note: these don't count as statistics, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deduction :P )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And if anyone wants to take this over to exi-freedom, Ill agree. That's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where this discussion belongs as has been stated in the past so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; times.
