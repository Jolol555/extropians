AI appears destined to be a box office failure in the United States.  From
<br>
boxofficeguru.com:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week's number one, A.I.: Artificial Intelligence slipped two spots
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to number three this weekend with $14M. Slipping an alarming 52% from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last weekend, A.I.'s total gross now stands at $59.6M. By comparison,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven Spielberg's Academy Award-winning Saving Private Ryan had $73.4M
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the bank over its first ten days. While A.I. may be able to reach
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the $100M mark, it still has to be considered a disappointment for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a film with two highly acclaimed names like Spielberg and Kubrick
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attached to it. The film, which cost a reported $100M to make,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has apparently scared away moviegoers with a darker than expected
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;story line.
<br>
<p>However, in Japan, AI set opening-day records.  Japan of course
<br>
has a tremendous cultural interest in robots.  Robot pets like the
<br>
Aibo are very popular there, and robots have dominated their cartoon
<br>
series for years, many of which have then been imported into the U.S.
<br>
<em>&gt;From <a href="http://www.zap2it.com/movies/boxoffice/story/0,1259,---7519,00.html">http://www.zap2it.com/movies/boxoffice/story/0,1259,---7519,00.html</a>:
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America's love for &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; may not have been
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strong enough to deliver blockbuster returns Stateside, but Japan,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the most receptive market in the world to American movies, is picking
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up the slack.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan's widest release ever at 524 screens, the Steven Spielberg-helmed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;production reaped $11.6 million over the Saturday-Sunday period,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;including Friday night previews and last Saturday's record-breaking
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$2.6 million sneak, according to the picture's distributor Warner
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bros..
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sans sneaks, that marks the biggest two-day debut of all time and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eclipses &quot;The Matrix&quot; by 164 percent to be a new Japanese record
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for distributor Warner Bros., demolishes &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; by 166
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;percent to be the best June opening and zaps past &quot;Independence Day&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by 34 percent for the non-sequel crown.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of admissions though, the sci-fi epic set the all-time
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;record, selling 1,037,879 tickets dethroning &quot;Star Wars: Episode I -
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Phantom Menace&quot;, which sold 916,540 in its 1999 debut frame.
