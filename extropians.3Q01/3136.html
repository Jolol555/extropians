:-D  Heheheh
<br>
This is a *wonderful* idea Spike!
<br>
I will happily donate the contents of my vacuum cleaner to such games -- 
<br>
lotsa dust there.
<br>
<p>Oh, wait, I have never played paintball... do the dust bombs need to be 
<br>
colored? All my dust is just grey... but I reckon it is bio-friendly... all 
<br>
the dust mites in there would tend to prove that.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideally pop into dust cloud like that which results from clapping two
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very dusty erasers.  Anyone remember real chalkboard erasers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We could even make the dry paintballs out of some material that

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
