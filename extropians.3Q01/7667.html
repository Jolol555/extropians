Pat Fallon wrote :
<br>
<p>...that the US are Evil, and that it is all Their Fault, and I recalled
<br>
the first chapters of Kaczynski's essay (it is not an argument, I
<br>
know, sorry).
<br>
<p>As to intervening in the rest of the globe or not, the US may have
<br>
done it in exaggeration in the past, but won't they now be FORCED to
<br>
do it more and more, as the dangers grow with the destructiveness of
<br>
the available weapons ? They need to avoid at any cost that a
<br>
malevolent (sorry Pat, to be such Manicheist) power develops out of
<br>
control. Poor Iraq, for example, is presently trying to build atomic
<br>
weapons.
<br>
<p>I think this is pretty much an extropian topic, as one of the problems
<br>
with the extropian plan is to know whether we will live to see it
<br>
happening / make it happen. For the large view of it, again, I think
<br>
of Drexler's &quot;Engines of creation&quot; (part three).
<br>
<p>Do you agree with such necessity in the long run ? Do you connect the
<br>
present situation to this necessity, or think that we speak of
<br>
different time scales ? Do you think that the present attitude of the
<br>
US is ahead or behind of such necessity ?
<br>
<p>I realize that, specially for an American, it may be difficult to
<br>
speak out on this, as no one wants to seem arrogant. On the other
<br>
hand, if there is some urgency, shouldn't we openly face these things ?
