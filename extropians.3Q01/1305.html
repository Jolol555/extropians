<p>Health care is imminently accessible here in the US. What studies find
<br>
is that many people who do not receive health care who are also poor do
<br>
so out of choice, they are too proud to accept 'charity'.

</em><br>
<p>That is hardly the case. The majority of health care is paid for by
<br>
people who do not use it, and received by those who do not pay for it.
<br>
Non-profit hospitals write off 5% of their services, and for-profits
<br>
write off 2.5%. This does not include services paid for by Medicare,
<br>
Medicaid, or state provided insurance plans or private insurance.
<br>
Vermont, for example, covers every child up to age 18 whose parents make
<br>
less than $50,000 or so in it's &quot;Dr. Dinosaur&quot; program, paid for by tax
<br>
dollars.
<br>
<p>In private insurance, the majority of policy holders pay significantly
<br>
more in premiums than they receive in services, as most health care
<br>
dollars go to patients with chronic problems, far in excess of any
<br>
premiums they pay.
<br>
<p>I've determined from family history and life expectancy that I do not
<br>
need to expect any chronic health problems for many years. Accidents and
<br>
catastrophes seem to be my primary risks. I do not engage in many risky
<br>
behaviors outside of skiing and driving (shooting risks run down around
<br>
the level of civil aviation and are not significant). I don't smoke, do
<br>
drugs, and am not significantly promiscuous. I have also been without
<br>
health insurance for about ten years outside of my veterans benefits. If
<br>
I had obtained health insurance in that time, I would have paid
<br>
somewhere between $25k-30k dollars, at a minimum, if not much more due
<br>
to the fact I have been self employed. Projecting over my life
<br>
expectancy, I expect at worst to have to have my gall bladder removed at
<br>
some point (at a cost of $8k-10k), and a skin melanoma at some time in
<br>
my 70's or 80's, and I fully expect to elect to have one or more
<br>
vertebrae replaced at some point in time (which would not likely be
<br>
covered anyways by insurance). If I pay $250 a month in health insurance
<br>
premiums, I would expect to pay in $150,000 in current year dollars for
<br>
such coverage, with at worst receiving about $50,000 in health care
<br>
services.
<br>
<p>And while some who met me at Extro5 might take me to task for the weight
<br>
I've gained due to my back difficulties, I have an entirely normal blood
<br>
pressure and below average cholesterol, and being overweight is a normal
<br>
characteristic of my family, along with longevity.
