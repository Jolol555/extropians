<p>A state of war or national emergency is a fine time to impose taxation.
<br>
The problem is sunsetting. Getting rid of wartime taxation and laws
<br>
after the war is over is difficult under the current system.
<br>
<p>Under a libertarian system, individuals would be so well armed that use
<br>
of taxation wouldn't be necessary, even if an agressor was dumb enough
<br>
to try to invade such a territory. The Swiss model has functioned quite
<br>
fine for a long time. How much do they spend in taxes on defense? Very
<br>
little. One vote = one machine gun = real liberty.
