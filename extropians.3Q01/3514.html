<p><em>&gt; Yeah, anyone who doesn't support rent-a-riot

<p>I suppose this makes some kind of sense to someone,
<br>
but not to me.
<br>
<p>It seems not only nonsensical (what the heck is a
<br>
rent-a-riot?) but non sequitur and vicious well past
<br>
the point of any possible provocation as well.
<br>
<p>The &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; thing is &quot;sequitur&quot;, but vicious, mean
<br>
and indicative of poor debating skills.
<br>
<p>Further, my sense of this is that you just attempted
<br>
to use ridicule and sarcasm rather than reasoned
<br>
discourse.
<br>
<p>I could also construe this to mean that you just
<br>
claimed I AM a supporter of rent-a-riot politics...
<br>
which you make clear is a bad thing and thus meant to
<br>
be a personal insult.  Add to that the defamation
<br>
inherent by your implication that I would call any
<br>
person an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot;.
<br>
<p>We were doing so good before this Mike.  Why did you
<br>
have to bring it down to this level?
<br>
<p>That effectively ends the discussion, at least from my
<br>
side.  Feel free to carry on by yourself.
<br>
<p>So Lee?  You've been championing reasoned discourse
<br>
lately.  How do you feel about this post of Mike's?
<br>
