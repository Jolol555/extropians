Well, I suppose I must comment on this even though it brings up
<br>
a past I sometimes wish were buried....
<br>
<p>We were working with Tom's samples 5 years ago and had worked
<br>
our way through a good number of them when it became clear
<br>
the work was problematic.  Why?  Because the advisors could
<br>
not agree with any certainty on how many genes there might be
<br>
and what their penetrance (force of impact) was.  Without such
<br>
information doing genome scans for aging genes is like sitting
<br>
down at a Las Vegas table of poker players that you have never
<br>
seen before.  You don't know if they are all schmucks from
<br>
Hicksville or the smartest card sharks west of the Mississippi.
<br>
<p>Note carefully what is said:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;a section of 'chromosome four' that appeared to be the same
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in all the old people&quot;
<br>
<p>Translation from science speak -- they have a genetic marker
<br>
on chromosome 4 that correlates with longevity.  Genome scans
<br>
for inherited traits now probably use markers that identify
<br>
regions 5-10 megabases in size (containing multiple genes).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;believed to contain up to 10 crucial disease-fighting genes&quot;
<br>
<p>Since the human genome sequence is relatively complete, this
<br>
translates as &quot;there are 10 genes within the marker region
<br>
that *could* be crucial disease-fighting genes&quot;.  Probablility
<br>
that there are 10 genes or even 5 genes, I'd argue is pretty
<br>
close to zero.  One, or two if they are lucky is much more
<br>
probable.  Why pick the number 10?  Thats the number that
<br>
we typically wrestled with because that is the number that
<br>
George Martin cited in his paper in comparing the characteristics
<br>
of diseases causing premature death with the characteristics
<br>
of aging.  It doesn't have any real basis other than being an
<br>
&quot;educated guess&quot;.  As I recall the same paper estimated that up
<br>
to 70 genes could be involved in aging.
<br>
<p>Another way of looking at this is that they only had enough
<br>
genome samples to identify one genome region at the level
<br>
of statistical significance.  We were well aware of this problem
<br>
as well as the cost of obtaining such samples.  If one is going
<br>
to undertake this as a commercial effort, one needs cost-benefit
<br>
tradeoffs -- how much does it cost to get a sample vs. how much
<br>
does it contribute to the information base.  The lack of agreement
<br>
amongst the scientists in this area is what made this exercise
<br>
one of futility.
<br>
<p>I'll be interested in seeing the the paper though.  If a scan
<br>
of that region turns up any genes with sex-hormone related
<br>
promoters, or contains transcriptional regulatory factors, then
<br>
it will be *very* provocative and may cast some light on the
<br>
determinants of the &quot;rate of aging&quot;.
<br>
<p>However, it will only be the beginning of a very long quest.
<br>
Getting you a 20% boost in average longevity is only solving
<br>
a very very small part of the problem.  But it may be enough
<br>
to get many people up to the singularity, so in that respect
<br>
it is good.  What is bad is situation of people like James
<br>
Swayze who may not get a chance to take advantage of it
<br>
or an even larger majority of people who aren't even aware
<br>
that there may be choices available and its not all &quot;predestined&quot;.
<br>
<p>There are days when I simply must say:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Damn it, Damn it all to Hell.&quot;
<br>
as unextropic as that may be.
<br>
