<p>The philosophy of open-source is about making software that will always 
<br>
have the source code freely available, not about taking other people's 
<br>
software. There is a big distinction.
<br>
<p>The idea is that companies that restrict customers' freedom will be less 
<br>
successful in the long run than those that give their customers maximum 
<br>
freedom. Would you prefer to get software that comes with the source code 
<br>
so that it is maintainable into the forseeable future? Or would you prefer 
<br>
to buy some closed-source software in the hope that the company will still 
<br>
be operating in 6 months when the inevitable bugs are found and that they 
<br>
will have fixed them... or even be interested in fixing them?
<br>
<p>I am sure there are anti-property anarchists in the computing industry in 
<br>
general, and some of those are bound to be in the open-source movement. But 
<br>
I have actually met very few anti-property anarchists in the computing 
<br>
arena, and suspect that they are mostly good saturday paper scare material.
<br>
<p>Even Richard Stallman, the most hard-line free software advocate doesn't 
<br>
suggest people steal software. He wants people to cease using any 
<br>
closed-source software -- bought or stolen. His point is that it is not in 
<br>
their best interests. He alway reminds people that he means &quot;free&quot; as in 
<br>
free speech, not free beer.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
