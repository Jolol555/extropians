<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Joe dees:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I also appreciate Mike's removing this discussion to its proper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;venue on exi-freedom.
</em><br>
<p>Too bad you're the only one who ignores the lists better interests.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, since you seem to think it's okay to keep discussing it, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will (see what happens when you insist on having the last word?). 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Dr. Emerson, who is the plaintiff in US v. Emerson did not do what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you claim he did. His separated wife, months after he caught her
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and her boyfriend in bed together and allegedly threatened them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(which is what created their divorce proceedings), saw fit to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perform some sort of sitdown strike in his office: she wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leave his place of business and was interfering with his patients.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He ordered her to leave, and when she wouldn't, he called the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;police and pulled a gun on her to restrain her until the police
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arrived. His daughter was never around.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Furthermore, her claims about his 'threats' remained
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unsubstantiated and were never examined in court, he was never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;afforded his due process rights, when the judge unilaterally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issued a restraining order.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Dr. Emerson has never been charged with domestic abuse of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sort, does not have a criminal record, while his wife has a record
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of mental instability. Once again, Joe, you are caught in another
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one of your conflations.
</em><br>
