<p>I was pretty happy with it actually. It was cut a lot, of course,
<br>
including
<br>
my reply to that inane comment about uploading being a male fantasy..
<br>
blecho. All in all, though, I've seen sillier episodes of Aftershock.
<br>
Given
<br>
that there's about 15 minutes or so of panel discussion, and you are not
<br>
going to get much more than superficial coverage of an issue, I think we
<br>
did
<br>
ok.
<br>
<p>This may sound odd to anyone who has seen the show, but I am usually
<br>
completely unaware of that eye twitch thing. It was somehow in
<br>
character,
<br>
though :-)
