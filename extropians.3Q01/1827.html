<p>Dunno.  I mainly sat in the back and read science fiction.  :-)
<br>
Now and then I would look up long enough to see what they were
<br>
working on if it was a class like math.  I would take that,
<br>
abstract it, play with it, see if I could see how it was
<br>
initially derived and often derive the thing they would try to
<br>
rote force into young minds next week or month.  Then I would go
<br>
back to my book.  I would take the tests and generally ace them
<br>
when I cared about the subject but almost never did homework. 
<br>
SciFi taught me the magic and power of science and mathematics. 
<br>
School generally just made it boring.  
<br>
<p>Literature, humanities and history classes were more fun when
<br>
the teacher was inspired which did happen occassionally even in
<br>
public school.  
<br>
<p>I agree that mostly the accent was on obeying rules and
<br>
following forms and making pretty notebooks.  Actual thinking
<br>
and (Dewey preserve us) arguing or reasoning from or (horrors)
<br>
trying to integrate different topics in some general framework
<br>
were actively discouraged.
<br>
<p>It is strange to remember it but until the 9th grade I thought I
<br>
must be dumb.  The reason I thought that was that I couldn't
<br>
grasp the underlying logic or framework that made all the things
<br>
being thrown at us in school hang together.  I couldn't catch
<br>
what they were getting at with the approach or the seemingly
<br>
random collections of facts.  My intuition said there must be an
<br>
underlying system, a fabric of reality.  I assumed that everyone
<br>
else knew and I was missing it!   It took that long to realize
<br>
that there was no underlying system they knew or that guided
<br>
their teachings; any fragments of such that I thought I had
<br>
grasped were strictly my own invention.  It took a bit longer to
<br>
find the trail of education philosophy that claimed no such
<br>
system or integration should ever be attempted or used!
