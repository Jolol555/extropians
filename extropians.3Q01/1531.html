Wow! A really interesting thought train Barbara.
<br>
I am especially interested in your final paragraph.

<em>&gt;I've been wondering lately if it would be possible to form joint business

</em><br>
<p>This sounds like some of the more successful open-source projects where 
<br>
people participate as much or as little as they wish and choose how they 
<br>
wish to involve themselves, without traditional hierarchy.
<br>
<p>I can't remember who on this list pointed out that the common open-source 
<br>
model for development is not suitable for all endeavours, and I think I 
<br>
agree with them. But I also think you are onto something important here. If 
<br>
this could somehow blend some of the best aspects of capitalism with the 
<br>
best aspects of the open-source movement then it could be the key to having 
<br>
a kind of free market that naturally tends toward small groups. This might 
<br>
eliminate most of the reservations I have voiced earlier.
<br>
<p>The main problem remaining is social justice: how to ensure that a child 
<br>
born to parents who didn't want and couldn't afford children would not be 
<br>
condemned to second-class citizenry for their parents' mistake, or that a 
<br>
genius with a genetic disease would not be cast out of the medical system 
<br>
as uninsurable. This wastes very important resources.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;Someone will
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Guerillas on the net... hmmm...  :-)
<br>
<p>It brings to mind the problem in conquering the Viet-Cong: they were 
<br>
everywhere and nowhere, without center.
<br>
The French resistance too, with their use limited knowledge of associates 
<br>
to deliberately break up the large scale organisation into many smaller cells.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
