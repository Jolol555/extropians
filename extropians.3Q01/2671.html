<em>&gt; &gt; Not so sure.  It's hard to tell how the human mind would hold up after a

<em>&gt; &gt; theory, seems to me the problem with old brains is physical wear and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and degradation, rather than the running down of some amorphous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; clock.  But, again, I'm no scientist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The problems with current brains are due to physical wear and tear and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;running down of the biological clock.  *If* you fix that, *then* after a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;couple of centuries, you start running into the running down of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amorphous informational clock which I am postulating.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting...  What do you see as the basis for the non-physical 
<br>
degradation of the &quot;informational clock&quot;?  Is it simply that there are a 
<br>
finite (though huge) number of possible neural pathways, and that in order 
<br>
to form new patterns old ones must necessarily degrade?  If that's your 
<br>
viewpoint I suppose I could see that there would be a limit somewhere on the 
<br>
total amount of information a meat-based brain could acquire.  But I don't 
<br>
necessarily see that as a problem.  It seems that for every new datum you 
<br>
acquire there's probably an obsolete one you could discard to make space.  
<br>
You may not remember *everything* but the good stuff you'll keep.
<br>
<p>For instance I still remember very well how to operate an 8 track tape 
<br>
player.  I'd gladly give up that space for something useful (like, say, how 
<br>
to use Winamp).
