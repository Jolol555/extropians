<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I really hope this doesnt get out of hand, but Im gonna try to call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; this like I see it. Am I the only one picking up the message that men tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; to be more drawn to the dynamic environment of Capitalism, where women tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; to identify more with socialistic view? I think this may stem from some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; genetic orgins. It seems that women tend to relate more to &quot;security&quot; then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; to potential gains from risk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>There are differences in male and female brains and there are
<br>
some generalities (that don't specify specific individual
<br>
behavior or &quot;normalcy&quot;) that may have some relevance.  
<br>
<p>That said though, I don't think a contrast of &quot;dynamic
<br>
environment&quot; and &quot;socialistic&quot; on the other hand is at all
<br>
called for.  There is a general tendency of women to think more
<br>
in holistic terms and in terms of preserving and strengthening
<br>
(nurturing) groups they are part of.  This can include the
<br>
entire species.  There is a tendency to more heart/value level
<br>
things.   In men there is a tendency to more reason, sense of
<br>
justice and earning/acheiving or winning higher status over
<br>
others.  Again, these are only generalities.  I believe they are
<br>
strongly hormonal and related to fundamental sexual dimorphism
<br>
in fetal development.  That doesn't mean that any individual
<br>
cannot manifest things along these spectrums.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I think it's important to paint the entire picture, so please allow me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stretch the canvas.  Women have been a notch up from a slave to men in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic political environments.  In that as early as 100 years ago, women
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were the property of their fathers or their husbands (&quot;Man and wife&quot;), they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had been trained to live off the male owner like any other animal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Property moved from father to son, or husband to son.  This could help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clarify, at least to some degree, why a some women may have felt more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comfortable with socialism.  Today, is another picture.  Women preferring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socialism may have a nostalgia for the past, carry a bit of animosity for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the many years in slavery, or still harbor the broad consensus that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government owes its people - male and female - something in return for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heavy taxation.  Some have no moral issue with government grants and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand-outs which are not given without hard work and merit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't find this helpful at all.  Almost none of us grew up
<br>
with oppression of women as active as you talk about.  Sure it
<br>
was still very present in the 50s (but I was a child then), in
<br>
the 60s and getting better in the 70s.  Sure some is still with
<br>
us and especially outside of the Western world where there is a
<br>
tremendous amount yet to be done.  But in view of most of us
<br>
here not living under such conditions I seriously doubt that our
<br>
economic opinions have anything at all to do with such a
<br>
scenario as you have painted.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;And why not? The baby isn't gonna generate any profit this quarter. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;guy who wants a family can be all the capitalist he wants, but he needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to give up some of his own earnings for the wife and kids.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It makes sense to me that in a partnership where both parties want a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family, that both parties work and pay equally.  Producing and raising a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child is said to be one of the toughest jobs there is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do you think that housewives don't work?   Ha!  It is a bit
<br>
better today but in most two wage-earner families I know of the
<br>
woman comes home from the office and does most of the cooking,
<br>
cleaning and dealing with the children still on top of her
<br>
workday at the office.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Having to give up your own earnings to fund someone else's laziness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;certainly unfair, and I'm sure the socialist system recipient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;acknowledges this as he/she cashes their government check.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Are you going to claim that guaranteed income or all social
<br>
programs only exist to fund the recipient's &quot;laziness&quot;?  Do you
<br>
really believe this?  Because that is sure what you seem to
<br>
imply.
