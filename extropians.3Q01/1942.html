<em>&gt; There is no need to assume secret cabals of ex-stasi or KGB agents

</em><br>
<p>This definitely agrees with my personal experiences with such.  Now, if
<br>
this diagnosis is correct, what is the best cure?  Education (but how
<br>
to get it into unwilling heads)?  Publically discrediting this belief
<br>
system (but how to do so powerfully enough to pry it loose)?  Or is
<br>
there a more effective way?
