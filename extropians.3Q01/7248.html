<em>&gt; In Vietnam, there was a fairly open press and we saw lots of disturbing

<em>&gt; pictures of bodies, screaming naked children, napalm, etc. In the Gulf
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War, the press was under a great deal of control, and we saw lots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pictures of precision guided weapons hitting bunkers and aqueducts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So perhaps we should stop trying to answer the dorky, loser questions --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like how to win a worldwide war against terrorism or protect the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from further attacks -- and discuss the really tough question facing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military-infotainment complex today: namely how to produce the war to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get the best ratings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Somehow I doubt showing million dollar missiles slamming into tents is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gonna do it. After a few press conferences with Powell or whoever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running videos and saying: &quot;Here's the terrorist jeep. Now you see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missile coming in, and there's the direct hit on the jeep&quot;, people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gonna get tired of that. And they have to show something or uppity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of the press may decide to try and do their own stories. Like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more and more interviews with tearful relatives of the WTC victims.
</em><br>
<p>Fortunately, we have the Northern Alliance to help out on the ground.
<br>
They've been on the defensive primarily because the Taliban has gotten
<br>
control of more abandoned soviet equipment: more fighter planes, more
<br>
tanks, etc. Both sides are reduced primarily to infantry tactics,
<br>
though. The Northern Alliance controls more of the mountainous Hindu
<br>
Kush areas in the northeast and central regions, as well as an area in
<br>
the southwest region.
<br>
<p>Establishing an alliance with the Northern Alliance, and air dropping in
<br>
significant amounts of supplies, weapons, and ammo, as well as giving
<br>
them additional heavy weaponry would go a long way to quickly gaining a
<br>
foothold in the country.
<br>
<p>I think strikes on the Taliban's remaining military assets: it's Sukhoi
<br>
fighters, Tu-54 and 55 tanks, etc would also help tip the tactical
<br>
balance. Bringing in US special forces units to work with the NA on the
<br>
ground, providing the NA infantry with better night vision equipment,
<br>
and possibly body armor, etc would also help out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One choice is showing blown-up buildings. Unfortunately I'm sure the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sign-making industries in terrorist-supporting countries are busy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; churning out 'Baby Milk Plant', 'Orphanage', 'Children's Hospital', and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'Pharmaceutical Factory' signs by the boatload and distributing them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around the countryside, for quick placement at bombed sites before the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; media arrives. This might also be an opportunity for countries with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high infant and child mortality rate to make some extra bucks by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserving and stocking up on corpses to scatter around bombed sites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along with the signs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suppose they could show bodies again. They don't even need to be real,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just shovel some sand in a body bag and lay'em out in neat rows.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Captured weapons caches are another possibility, and again there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plenty of file footage available. Maybe a gov't buy-back program for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AK47s would be useful here.
</em><br>
<p>I thought of something like this, but more along the lines of a bounty
<br>
on Taliban: $100 US for each rifle and Taliban head brought in.
<br>
<p>Producing fake bodies is not needed, the real thing is all to prevalent
<br>
already in that country.
