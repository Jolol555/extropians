Hello <a href="mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20Impact%20on%20history&In-Reply-To=&lt;e.12a83d65.28d61f5a@aol.com&gt;">mlorrey@datamann.com</a> (Mike Lorrey),
<br>
<p>In reference to your comment:
<br>
<p>è THis is the force initiation principle at work. We never
<br>
è hurt the afghan people, in fact, we supported them in
<br>
è their fight against an oppressor for ten years with
<br>
è hundreds of millions of dollars. They turn around and
<br>
è allow a government like the Taliban to decide that we,
<br>
è their allies, are the enemy. So, this is not a case of us
<br>
è just killing a people we have never met, never had any
<br>
è beef with. We helped them, they turn around and
<br>
è betray us and host a group on their soil that attacks
<br>
è us. In the muslim world, if your house guest commits a
<br>
è crime against your neighbor, you are responsible for
<br>
è that crime.  
<br>
<p>Yes we against the Soviets, and the Al Qeda Movement seeks to reverse 500 
<br>
years of Islamic Political Decline, with the United States as the &quot;Great 
<br>
Satan&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;This is also a responsibility issue. Many, if
</em><br>
è not most, muslim nations tend to hold, to a greater or
<br>
è lesser degree, to the idea that attacks on muslim
<br>
è nations by infidels are attacks on all, that allowing
<br>
è infidel armies into muslim lands, even in defense of a
<br>
è muslim nation, is an affront to Islam (this is the whole
<br>
è basis for bin Laden's arguments that have gained
<br>
è credence among the common people of the muslim
<br>
è world). If this is so, then it is up to muslim nations to
<br>
è be responsible for the defense of muslim nations, AND
<br>
è for the policing of their own. The Taliban, and bin
<br>
è Laden, exist because muslim nations around the world
<br>
è allow them to exist. If they truly believe that western
<br>
è armies should stay out of muslim nations, they should
<br>
è take care of this problem themselves. 
<br>
<p>They are thug governments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I hope that plenty of muslims realize what they, in their collective
</em><br>
è responsibility, have done to the world. Unfortunately, I 
<br>
è doubt it. From all experience, it seems they are quite
<br>
è enamored of the classic sort of criminal rationalization:
<br>
è killing a hostage, and blaming the negotiator &quot;see what
<br>
è you made me do?&quot;. This is a consistent excuse
<br>
è through Iran, Lebanon, Iraq, and elsewhere. 
<br>
<p>Its a fact that we all must have to deal with. And yes I suspect the American 
<br>
government and people will not have the focus to basically, replace Middle 
<br>
eastern governments that participate in this kind of mentality. Schools would 
<br>
have to be closed and our propaganda would have to replace Islamist 
<br>
propaganda with secular &quot;propaganda&quot;, as was done in post-war Japan and 
<br>
Germany. We will strike at and defeat Bin Ladin, and declare it victory and 
<br>
like Mike says, they will hit us next time with antrax, sarin,  nuclear.  The 
<br>
reaction then, as Mike indicated, will be a less-free, society.
