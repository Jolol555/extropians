<p><em>&gt; &gt;Still... I am me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but *who else could you be*?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is something like the obverse of asking `who would I have been if my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents had been different people than they were?' Well, obviously, *you*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't have been there to ask the question. But *someone* would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been. And whoever asks any self-reflexive question sees the answer they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking for in the mirror, even though what they see is reversed and coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the wrong direction.
</em><br>
<p>I think that it sometimes happens that the answer is &quot;I'm not me 
<br>
anymore!&quot;.   I believe that this was an actual Arnold Schwartzenegger
<br>
quote in &quot;Total Recall&quot;, where the possibility was raised that a 
<br>
number of false memories had been implanted.
<br>
<p>I'm happy when I can recall an incident from high school and then
<br>
reflect, &quot;yes, that was me all right&quot;, and disappointed when I
<br>
recall an incident from too many years ago and have to say, &quot;I'm
<br>
not really the same person anymore&quot;.  Amnesiacs can determine from
<br>
purely objective data that their identities have changed.
<br>
<p>So Loree's statement is indeed quite meaningful.  Moreover, some
<br>
people could undergo changes as severe as sex-change, and truly
<br>
feel that they *weren't* the same person any longer (although I
<br>
have no evidence to back that guess up).  The whole question of
<br>
personal identity is highly (though not entirely IMO) value
<br>
laden, and one could imagine someone who lived only for climbing
<br>
mountains exclaiming after becoming a quadriplegic &quot;My life is
<br>
over&quot;.
