</em><br>
<p>Ever since the 1930's, science fiction has been dismissed by the
<br>
literary establishment as 'pulp', i.e. &quot;Not Our Kind, Dear&quot; writing, not
<br>
literature at all. A major part of this distain for science fiction
<br>
among the literary intelligentsia is that the intelligentsia in the 20th
<br>
century, as has been illustrated by Greg Burch's writing, has been
<br>
generally of an anti-technology left-wing bent. Kuhn of Harvard launched
<br>
his assault on the ramparts of objective science in the early 50's,
<br>
which has resulted generally in the current left wing and public distain
<br>
of science as simply one more battleground of class warfare that the
<br>
white male establishment uses to enforce its patriarchy.
<br>
<p>The golden age writers like Heinlein, Campbell, Clarke, and others saw
<br>
this coming. L Ron Hubbard retreated into his cult, while Azimov
<br>
retreated into treating science like a religion. Heinlein was constantly
<br>
experimenting with various ideas to spread SF and 'free thinker' ideas
<br>
in society. He was always, you'll notice, sublimating sexual ideas in
<br>
his juvinile novels, and eventually published Stranger in a Strange Land
<br>
which helped launch the sexual revolution.
<br>
<p>Heinlein was very concerned about the perceived growing influence of the
<br>
USSR in the world in the 50's and 60's, and with the exposure of the
<br>
Cambridge spy ring in this period, it became clear to many that the
<br>
socialist and communist movements in the west were closely tied with the
<br>
Communist Party in the USSR, as has been confirmed in the Venona Files.
<br>
Communist cells in California contained many Hollywood stars and
<br>
writers, who were constantly under pressure from the political officers
<br>
in their cells to adapt their work to communicate communist propaganda
<br>
in the US media.
<br>
<p>While the McCarthy hearings DID violate the civil rights of many
<br>
Hollywood people, this does not mean that they were not communists, or
<br>
that they were not being influenced by political officers.
<br>
<p>Heinlein's travels to the USSR, his learning of Russian, etc were all in
<br>
order to learn more of the truth about what was going on behind the iron
<br>
curtain, and his articles on his travels in the USSR, even under the
<br>
shepherding of Party apparatchiks, portrayed a very different country
<br>
from that promoted by the Party propaganda in the west.
<br>
<p>Campbell and Heinlein, as well as De Camp and others had wanted to break
<br>
into literary respectability for a long time. The early pictures of SF
<br>
'conventions' I've seen were not the huge popular things we see today,
<br>
but small, insular coffee table and conference room type things that any
<br>
Extropian of today would find rather familiar. They KNEW that their
<br>
ideas were of paramount importance to the future of humanity. Heinlein
<br>
and others figured out that fiction focused on ideas didn't fly with
<br>
western literary authorities, they needed to develop excellent
<br>
characterization skills, and focus stories around people. Idea based
<br>
fiction is generally characteristic of Russian literature (one reason
<br>
why SF is always so much more respected in Russia).
<br>
<p>Despite all the characterization work, they didn't fool the literary
<br>
establishment. They were leftist enough to recognise that 'all art is
<br>
propaganda', and that SF was art that had dangerous ideas in it.
<br>
<p>Still, Heinlein experimented with different styles (as literary
<br>
experimentation was the rage in the 60's) hoping something would catch.
<br>
SIASL seemed to have been the most effective at sneaking in under the
<br>
wire, since it dealt little with technology. It was almost exclusively a
<br>
character centered novel, albiet one that embraced a rather severe
<br>
anarchist ethic, which appealed to some literary types, and Michael
<br>
Valentine Smith's religous group was organized as a commune, so that was
<br>
politically correct as well. 
<br>
<p>Where SIASL succeeded somewhat in disguising anarchistic individualism
<br>
as communal utopia, Heinlein attempted to go further with TMIAHM in many
<br>
areas: rejecting the idea of world government, of centralized economic
<br>
control, and of reexamining all precepts of political organization, as
<br>
well as advocating ideas like 'rational anarchism', and polygamy.
<br>
Heinlein disguised these ideas under the cloak of a classic class
<br>
struggle, of serfs (lunies) against the king (Earth government), cloaked
<br>
in revolutionary theory, discussions of cell structured organizations,
<br>
agit-prop activities, along with strains of the French, US, and Russian
<br>
revolutions. The use of Russian slang in the novel was in excess of the
<br>
number of actual Russians on the moon. It actually seems that there were
<br>
far more chinese on the moon at the time than Russians, so I'd expect to
<br>
have seen more chinese slang than russian.
