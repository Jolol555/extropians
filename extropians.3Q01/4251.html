&lt;DIV&gt;There is quite a good book on this very topic
<br>
written by Wendy Seymour, 
<br>
<p>&lt;DIV&gt; modifying our bodies will obviously have a
<br>
profound effect on our sense of self, 
<br>
<p>I agree it will have an effect, but NOT on whether we
<br>
perceive ourselves as still ourselves or not.
<br>
<p>Words are tricky here.. when somebody says &quot;I'm not
<br>
the person I was&quot; we understand them to mean that they
<br>
have changed in some significant way... but we don't
<br>
understand them to mean that they are a new entity,
<br>
separate and distinct from their previous self, like a
<br>
child is from a parent.
<br>
<p>BTW, I'm not the man I once was. ö¿ö
<br>
<p>Still... I am me.
<br>
<p>And that is my take on what will happen if and when we
<br>
are able to move our minds from one physical body to
<br>
another (whether that be biological,
<br>
electromechanical, some combination of the two or
<br>
something completely new that has no current
<br>
analogue)... we will still perceive ourselves as &quot;us&quot;.
<br>
<p>The real interesting part comes when and if we can
<br>
make copies... multiple instantiations of a single
<br>
individual.
<br>
<p>I lean towards the idea they will all equally be me...
<br>
&nbsp;If there is a soul, it will have to be divided up
<br>
between them, I guess.  I wonder if that means each of
<br>
me will be less able to play the blues as each will
<br>
have less soul. ö¿ö
