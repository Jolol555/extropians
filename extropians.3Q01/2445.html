<br>
<em>&gt; You are quite wrong.  I don't think I've ever met anyone so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorant of history as to be unaware of slavery.
</em><br>
<p>You never met anyone so ignorant of history?  Moi?  Lee, dearest, do you
<br>
remember just a couple of days ago, when you were telling me that &quot;It really
<br>
would be best for all concerned to avoid personal references like this.
<br>
Surely, with practice, we can all learn to make our points without venturing
<br>
dangerously close to the ad hominem.&quot;
<br>
<p>But then, I suppose, you literally meant &quot;ad hominem&quot; ... (i.e., it's always
<br>
open season on &quot;ad feminem&quot;?)
<br>
<p>You also wrote about the importance of &quot;confin[ing] oneself to careful
<br>
argument.&quot;
<br>
<p>And you didn't do that, either.  Dear, oh dear - what am I going to do with
<br>
you?
<br>
<p>You wrote:  It's usually
<br>
<em>&gt; put forth as the reason that the Civil War was fought, &quot;to free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the slaves&quot;.  Abraham Lincoln is probably best known &quot;for freeing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the slaves.&quot;   Okay :-)  maybe you didn't hear this growing up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because you weren't here.
</em><br>
<p>I never mentioned Abraham Lincoln, and as a matter of fact I've read a bit
<br>
on the Civil War.  I did say I am not a native speaker, but I have attended
<br>
U.S. schools (except for the first few school years).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If Thomas Sowell says that racism doesn't exist in the U.S.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; he's lying ... if that's what he says ...).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; By no means does he say such a thing!
</em><br>
<p>Lee, I didn't say Sowell says such a thing.  That's why I wrote the word
<br>
&quot;IF&quot; up there a couple of times.  I read a few of Sowell's articles few
<br>
years ago, and I wasn't impressed with his one-sided view of things.  Maybe
<br>
I should still keep checking to see what Sowell writes from time to time
<br>
(just for the sake of getting a different perspective).  And if you would be
<br>
interested in my guy, Randall Robinson, take a look at his books:  The Debt;
<br>
and Defending the Spirit.  I doubt you will, but I just thought I'd throw
<br>
that in, just in case you may be interested.
<br>
<p>No one denies that racism
<br>
<em>&gt; exists.  But some people call racist the belief that not all groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are exactly equal to all other groups in every way  ...
</em><br>
<p>I also call racist the tendency of white people not to want to take any
<br>
responsibility for the egregious crimes against blacks in the USA.  If
<br>
blacks had had the same opportunities as whites, without those generations
<br>
upon generations of families which were torn from each other at will
<br>
(shifted about and sold to the highest bidder), used as sex slaves, denied
<br>
education, self-determination, dignity and personhood - only to be shunned
<br>
and excluded after the end of slavery for several more generations ... if
<br>
you don't think that that may just be one of the contributing reasons why
<br>
&quot;not all groups are exactly equal to all other groups in every way ...&quot;
<br>
you're right.  But who's responsible for this state of affairs?  And think
<br>
about this:  if whites had gone through what blacks had to go through for
<br>
those hundreds of years, our &quot;pecking&quot; order may have been in reverse order
<br>
at this stage of the game.
<br>
<p>, or that people
<br>
<em>&gt; have a built-in (but not necessarily strong) preference for people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that resemble themselves.
</em><br>
<p>If it's not necessarily strong, then it would practically be nonexistent IMO
<br>
if we lived in a society that valued diversity and equality.  For the
<br>
record, I kind of go along with the &quot;opposites attract&quot; school, myself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There seems to be so much concern about a little tax money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; going to undeserving, lazy, good-for-nothin's among some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Some people have said that, not me.  I just don't want to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bad situation worse.  Do you appreciate that welfare actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes some bad situations worse?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I do.  But first, let's be specific.  There were (and are) different
<br>
kinds of welfare.  Aid to people with disabilities.  Aid to mothers with
<br>
dependent children.  I believe you all refer to the latter, usually, when
<br>
you speak of &quot;welfare.&quot;  I think welfare which provided mothers with just
<br>
subsistence level income has contributed to making some bad situations
<br>
worse, yes.  If the payments were a bit more generous, their kids may have
<br>
been better off, eaten better, gone to better schools - and as a result
<br>
there may have been a few more escapees from the cycle of poverty.  When I
<br>
was young and idealistic I worked with welfare mothers in Chicago at one
<br>
time.  Most of them were around my age (20, at the time), and were mature
<br>
and responsible beyond their years.  But they'd never been out of Chicago,
<br>
hardly ever out of their neighborhood, in fact, did not know of any other
<br>
way to live - it was the only life they knew.  And they were world weary at
<br>
an early age, before becoming wordly wise.  Their subsistence income
<br>
provided special &quot;extras&quot; - like &quot;extra&quot; bus fare to go to the doctor, but
<br>
in order to get that extra dollar or whatever, they would need to go to the
<br>
welfare office, wait for hours (often, with a kid or two in tow), fill out
<br>
forms, and hope for the best.  I observed them for the year I worked in
<br>
Chicago, and came away inspired by them - their generosity (I was often
<br>
treated to good Southern home cooking), their love for their children, their
<br>
sociability, their sense of humor and their ability to have a little fun -
<br>
which kept them going amidst the chaos of their lives.  Often, when their
<br>
children started school, the mothers would get jobs (and had to leave the
<br>
kids at home to fend for themselves - part of the problem = no day care
<br>
centers).
<br>
<p>One thing you never responded to, Lee, and that was my quip about George W.
<br>
Bush.  Even though I was being sarcastic, it was still a serious question.
<br>
I read loud and clear that you are opposed to affirmative action.  But, you
<br>
see, we have affirmative action for white people (that's what I meant to
<br>
imply when I said that George W. Bush is an Affirmative Action Baby
<br>
(&quot;AAB&quot;)).  Why aren't you opposed to affirmative action for white people?
<br>
Did George W. Bush get into the White House on his own merit?  Or is he
<br>
(gasp ... groan ... slap on forehead!) an ... AAB?
<br>
<p>Later,
<br>
