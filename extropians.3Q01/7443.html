<em>&gt; Better idea than rappelling gear: an emergency belt that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connected to a steel cable on a reel next to all windows.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The reel has a centrifugal clutch and damping so that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lowers the victim quickly up top and slows her descent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; near the ground.  Remember the reel is set according to how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far it is off the ground.  After the victim unbuckles and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flees, the device could reel in the cable for the next person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Recall that a steel cable strong enough to support a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is very small, 2 mm diameter is ample.  In the case of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WTC, there would be no need to design it for a 400+ lb person,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a lardbutt would be unable to egress from those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; narrow windows in any case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This idea sounds very cool but would not work because the little basket
<br>
designed to lower one person at a time to the ground would be beseiged by 10
<br>
panicking New Yorkers all clambering on top of each others heads to get out.
<br>
It then fails and lowers them all to the ground a little too quickly and
<br>
subsequently becomes inoperative.
<br>
<p>Extremely tall buildings cannot have openable windows because of the danger
<br>
of people throwing themselves and other things out.
<br>
<p>But it is a cool idea.
