</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In a word: No.  It is essentially impossible to sustain a ground
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; operation by air-drop (i.e. parachute) or even by airlift (i.e.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; building or capturing runways) unless your supply base is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nearby or the operation is tiny. &quot;Amateurs study tactics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Professionals study logistics.&quot; Take a look at a map. Notice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how far Afghanistan (and specifically Kabul and the Kandahar)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are from anywhere except Pakistan. Note that cargo aircraft
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cannot take off and land from aircraft carriers. Remember the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Gulf war? The US spent six months building up the supply base.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There are a few people on this list that have some practical knowledge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these things.  The situation is pretty much this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We could support a division or two of light infantry and maybe an Air
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Cavalry unit in Afghanistan.  Note that for rugged mountainous terrain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these units are among the best suited, particularly if backed up by some air
</em><br>
<em>&gt;support.  History has shown that heavy mechanized units do not fare well in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;many parts of Afghanistan -- ask the Russians.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm am not to sure about this you could probably lose ( misplace ) a 
<br>
decent sized
<br>
Army in the Afghan mountains. Your troops would need to cover a lot of ground
<br>
simultaneously to deny the Bin Ladden/Taliban the use of shelter such as caves
<br>
and small settlements.
<br>
As far as air support is concerned helicopters have problems
<br>
in the Afghan mountains due to the thinner air at altitude producing less 
<br>
rotor lift.
<br>
The Afghans became very adept during the conflict with Russia at suckering
<br>
Russian SU25's into making attack runs that exposed them to stinger SAM 
<br>
missile
<br>
attacks, taking a pretty heavy toll. It's also  worth knowing that the 
<br>
SU25's flight
<br>
performance is considerably better than the US equivalent the A10 Warthog.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;However, there is a wildcard in the Russians.  I'm reading this morning that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they have mobilized units near the Afghan border.  It is quite possible that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we could get logistical support and a heavy mechanized hammer for the flat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;areas from the Russians.
</em><br>
<p>Thats great but Bin Laden, and the Taliban if they are attacked, are not 
<br>
very likely
<br>
to stay in the lowlands. As you pointed out the Afghans fought a very 
<br>
successful
<br>
campaign from the mountains against Russia. They also did the same to us Brits
<br>
in around 1920. In fact they have pretty much done the same thing every 
<br>
time they
<br>
have been invaded.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Note that the Russian force structure has difficulty working in extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mountainous terrain; the Afghans learned this years ago and used it against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them quite effectively.  If the US provided security in the heavily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mountainous regions, something we are capable of doing effectively, it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;give the Russians a chance to move heavy equipment where needed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If the Russians can control the plains, and leave the mountainous regions to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the kinds of units that the Americans will be able to support logistically,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any groups of militant or military Afghans will find themselves severely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;squeezed.  The targets are not numerically numerous, but they did learn how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to use the terrain to their advantage against the Russians.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The ability of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the US to control the mountainous terrain, something we are well-structured
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for, will determine whether or not this play is successful.
</em><br>
<p>In what way is the US force structure capable in this kind of roll. Trying 
<br>
to cover hundreds
<br>
of kilometers of saw backed mountains. Units forced to operate for days ( 
<br>
at least at a time )
<br>
isolated form support, seems to me exactly what US forces are not tailored for.
<br>
This whole scenario involving ground troops imho could become extremely 
<br>
protracted and costly
<br>
for the US.
