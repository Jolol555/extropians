Subject: Please make stable NON-US homes for strong crypto projects
<br>
<p>It's clear that the US administration is putting out feelers to
<br>
again ban publication of strong encryption.  See:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,46816,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,46816,00.html</a>
<br>
<p>The evil gnomes who keep advancing unconstitutional US anti-crypto
<br>
policies know that the current hysteria in Congress and the
<br>
Administration will not last forever.  So they will probably move very
<br>
quickly -- within a week is my guess -- to re-control encryption,
<br>
either by a unilateral action of the Administration (by amending
<br>
the Export Administration Regulations), or by stuffing a rider onto
<br>
some so-called &quot;emergency&quot; bill in Congress.
<br>
<p>They maneuvered very carefully in the Bernstein case such that there
<br>
is no outstanding injunction against violating the Constitution this
<br>
way -- and even no binding 9th-Circuit precedent that tells them it's
<br>
unconstitutional to do so.  They know in their hearts that numerous
<br>
judges have found it unconstitutional, but they have proven throughout
<br>
the seven-year history of the case that they don't give a damn about
<br>
the Constitution.  Which means it may take weeks, months or years for
<br>
civil liberties workers to get a judge to roll back any such action.
<br>
Not just days.  We won the case, but they squirmed out of any
<br>
permanent restrictions -- so far.
<br>
<p>The US government has a new mania for wiretapping everyone in case
<br>
they might be a terrorist.  There's already two bills in Congress to
<br>
make it trivial for them to wiretap anybody on flimsy excuses, and to
<br>
retroactively justify their precipitous act of rolling Carnivore boxes
<br>
into major ISPs this week and demanding, without legal authority, that
<br>
they be put at the heart of the networks.  See:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.politechbot.com/docs/cta.091401.html">http://www.politechbot.com/docs/cta.091401.html</a>
<br>
<p>Even more than before, we will need good encryption tools, merely to
<br>
maintain privacy for law-abiding citizens, political activists, and
<br>
human rights workers.  (In the current hysteria, mere messages
<br>
advocating peace or Constitutional rights might best be encrypted.)
<br>
The European Parliament also recently recommended that European
<br>
communications be routinely encrypted to protect them from pervasive
<br>
US Echelon wiretaps.
<br>
<p>Some US developers, who thought such a reversal would never happen,
<br>
have built or maintained a number of good open source encryption tools
<br>
in the United States, and may not have lined up solid foreign
<br>
maintainers or home sites.
<br>
<p>LET'S FIX THAT!  We need volunteers in many countries to mirror
<br>
current distributions, CVS trees, etc.  We need volunteers to also
<br>
act as maintainers, accepting patches and integrating them into
<br>
solid releases.
<br>
<p>(Note that too many countries have pledged to stand toe-to-toe with the
<br>
US while they march off to make war on somebody they can't figure out
<br>
who it is yet.  If you live in one of those countries, you may
<br>
suddenly find that your own crypto regs have been sneakily altered.
<br>
Take care that each useful package has maintainers and distribution
<br>
points in diverse countries.)
<br>
<p>I haven't kept close track of which packages are in danger.  I
<br>
suggest that people nominate packages on this mailing list, and that
<br>
others immediately grab mirror copies of them as they are nominated.
<br>
And that some of those who mirror them keep quiet, in case hysterical
<br>
governments make a concerted effort to stamp out all copies and/or all
<br>
major distribution sites.  If you aren't the quiet type, then *AFTER*
<br>
IMMEDIATELY PULLING A COPY OF THE CODE OUTSIDE US JURISDICTION,
<br>
announce your mirror on this mailing list.
<br>
<p>We freedom-loving US citizens have had to rely on the freedom-loving
<br>
citizens of saner countries, to do the work of making strong
<br>
encryption, for many years.  We had a brief respite, which we will
<br>
eventually resume for good.  In the meantime, please let me apologize
<br>
for my countrymen and for my government, for asking you to shoulder
<br>
most of the burden again.  Thank you so much.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Gilmore
<br>
<p>PS: Companies with proprietary encryption packages might consider
<br>
immediately open-sourcing and exporting their encryption add-ins, so
<br>
their customers can still get them from overseas archives.  Or taking
<br>
other actions to safeguard the privacy and integrity of their
<br>
customers' data and their society's infrastructure.  I also advise
<br>
that they lobby like hell to keep privacy and integrity legal in the US.
