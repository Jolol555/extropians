Security by obscurity isn't. Imagine what will happen when code will start
<br>
finding exploits instead of using documented exploit libraries. As to
<br>
closed source, have you heard about XP sources being leaked on h4x0r
<br>
sites? I haven't bothered to validate the rumor, but sooner or later it
<br>
will happen anyway.
<br>
<p>Suddenly, security by obscurity is revealed as a house of cards in a gale
<br>
that it is. Whereas the Open Source warez receive a thorough banging by
<br>
h4x0rs (amplified by kitties), and a turf of code review waves after
<br>
another (if NSA is going to use it internally, you can assume they're
<br>
going to keep at least the 'l33t d00dz out).

<p>Actually, I'm interested in keeping a fair fraction mainstream systems
<br>
insecure. Consider a somewhat guerilla tactic of writing a truly viral
<br>
MojoNation package, which silently infects anything infectable (Win* is
<br>
very widespread in the Far East due to all the pirates), and then just
<br>
sits in the background, with adaptable resource throttling (stealing
<br>
resources from users without their consent is obviously not ok). &lt;/LFP&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So hackers have no other recourse than going to public domain software

</em><br>

</em><br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; wanted to get something for nothing, while Windows was written by

<p>seasoned, very so. Vintage. Can't you just smell the quality?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; state of the art tools like Visual Studio. So which kernel would you

fine product, typical for Microsoft.

<p><em>&gt; prefer running your mission-critical floppy drive? Leave the code to

</em><br>
<p>You have me convinced, now. As soon as I get back home some radical

reinstallation is in order.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; PS: Who's Redmond? Win98 was written by Bill Gates last time I

<p>Billge is not evil enough by far, Ballmer was just using him as a front.
