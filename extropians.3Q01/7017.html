Every mainstream religion has a wooly enough collection of sacred texts
<br>
that you can find &quot;clear and unambiguous&quot; statements of just about 
<br>
anything you want.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How do we, as a free people, come to terms with these facts?  
</em><br>
<p>How do we, as a free people, come to terms with the corresponding
<br>
facts about, say, Christianity?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How do moderate Muslims rationalize their calls for peace and tolerance 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in light of the clear and unambiguous text of their scripture to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contrary?
</em><br>
<p>How do moderate Christians rationalize, etc, etc?
<br>
<p>By mentioning only Islam in your statements, you suggest that the
<br>
endorsement of violence, the requirement of discrimination, and the
<br>
inequality of women are features unique to Islam.  But they aren't;
<br>
the sacred books of Christianity and Judaism are equally susceptible
<br>
to quote-mining, and equally full of clear and unambiguous statements
<br>
that no rational person of good intent could endorse.  (On the other
<br>
hand, it's entirely possible to find statements in all three sets
<br>
of holy books denouncing violence and calling for brotherhood and
<br>
virtue and forgiveness.)
<br>
<p>I'm not sure if you mean to be singling out Islam, but that's the
<br>
effect of your letter.  The problem is of course much broader than
<br>
that; ancient religions in general aren't things that any sensible
<br>
parent would want a child playing with.  I'm not convinced that
<br>
Islam as a religious system is any worse than its siblings.  Do you 
<br>
have evidence that it is?  (How the followers of a particular
<br>
religious system actually behave is a somewhat different question.)
