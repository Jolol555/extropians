<br>
<em>&gt; That wasn't exactly the point I was making. What I was trying to hint at was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the religious fanaticism of the Taliban and other Muslim groups is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; largely funded and encouraged by the Saudis (and to a lesser extent the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UAE). In Pakistan for example the &quot;fundamentalist&quot; mullahs are funded almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely by Saudi money - the same here in Britain. (I have personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge of this as I was married for eight years to a lady whose family
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were Pakistani by origin and with connections to the elite in that country-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her grandfather had been a close friend of Jinnah). Mike Lorrey asked why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saudi or Gulf Arab dissidents don't attack their own countries' rulers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly. The answer is (a) they don't fancy tangling with the secret police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (b) there is a kind of implicit deal being done in the Saudi/Gulf states:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radicals are allowed to attack the U.S./Israel so long as they don't openly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack the Saudi regime. Those who are too honest to accept this are allowed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to go into exile but continue to get funding from &quot;charitable donations&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>So besides being deranged suicidal religious fanatics, the perpetrators of the
<br>
9-11 attack might also have been radical dissidents afraid of their own
<br>
countries' secret police... or expatriates too honest to accept the fraud and
<br>
deception of their homelands.
<br>
OK, I think I know why they hate us now: They're totally fucked-up, that's
<br>
why.
<br>
<p>Stephen Schwartz sez:
<br>
<em>&gt; Wahhabism. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a strain of Islam that emerged not during the Crusades, nor even at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time of the anti-Turkish wars of the 17th century, but less than two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; centuries ago. It is violent, it is intolerant, and it is fanatical beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure. It originated in Arabia, and it is the official theology of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gulf states. Wahhabism is the most extreme form of Islamic fundamentalism.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if it's the official theology of the Gulf states, then it's the official
<br>
responsibility of the Gulf states (especially, one might say, Iraq) to pay for
<br>
the 9-11 attack.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not all Muslims are suicide bombers, but all Muslim suicide bombers are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wahhabis - except, perhaps, for some disciples of atheist Leftists posing as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Muslims in the interests of personal power, such as Yasser Arafat or Saddam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hussein. Wahhabism is the Islamic equivalent of the most extreme Protestant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sectarianism. It is puritan, demanding punishment for those who enjoy any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music except the drum, and severe punishment up to death for drinking or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sexual transgressions. It condemns as unbelievers those who do not pray, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view that never previously existed in mainstream Islam.
</em><br>
<p>So, if Saddam Hussein uses Wahhabis as misguided missiles (a term coined by
<br>
Richard Dawkins), then Saddam Hussein should pay for the 9-11 attack.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The founder of the Saudi kingdom, Ibn Saud, established Wahhabism as its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; official creed.
</em><br>
<p>Now that's world class cognitive dissonance:
<br>
making a cult that hates you the official creed of your kingdom.
<br>
Whew! These guys are all brain diseased.
<br>
Entering  this conflicting data into machine intelligence would set the
<br>
Singularity back decades.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Much has been made of the role of the US in &quot;creating&quot; Osama
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bin Laden through subsidies to the Afghan mujaheddin, but as much or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be said in reproach of Britain which, three generations before,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supported the Wahhabi Arabs in their revolt against the Ottomans. Arab
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hatred of the Turks fused with Wahhabi ranting against the &quot;decadence&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ottoman Islam. The truth is that the Ottoman khalifa reigned over a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multinational Islamic umma in which vast differences in local culture and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tradition were tolerated. No such tolerance exists in Wahhabism, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why the concept of US troops on Saudi soil so inflames bin Laden.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bin Laden is a Wahhabi. So are the suicide bombers in Israel. So are his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Egyptian allies, who exulted as they stabbed foreign tourists to death at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Luxor not many years ago, bathing in blood up to their elbows and emitting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blasphemous cries of ecstasy. So are the Algerian Islamist terrorists whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribution to the purification of the world consisted of murdering people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for such sins as running a movie projector or reading secular newspapers. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are the Taliban-style guerrillas in Kashmir who murder Hindus. The Iranians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not Wahhabis, which partially explains their slow but undeniable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movement towards moderation and normality after a period of utopian and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; puritan revivalism. But the Taliban practise a variant of Wahhabism. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employ ancient punishments - such as execution for moral offences - and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a primitive and fearful view of women. The same is true of Saudi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arabia's rulers. None of this extremism has been inspired by American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fumblings in the world, and it has little to do with the tragedies that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beset Israelis and Palestinians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Wahhabis have two weaknesses of which the West is largely unaware; an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Achilles's heel on each foot, so to speak. The first is that the vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of Muslims in the world are peaceful people who would prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Western democracy in their own countries. They loathe Wahhabism for the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason any patriarchal culture rejects a violent break with tradition. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is the point that must be understood: bin Laden and other Wahhabis are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not defending Islamic tradition; they represent an ultra-radical break in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the direction of a sectarian utopia. Thus, they are best described as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islamo-fascists, although they have much in common with Bolsheviks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Bengali Sufi writer Zeeshan Ali has described the situation touchingly:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Muslims from Bangladesh in the US, just like any other place in the world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uphold the traditional beliefs of Islam but, due to lack of instruction,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep quiet when their beliefs are attacked by Wahhabis in the US
</em><br>
<p>**Wahhabis in the US?? **
<br>
OK everybody... time to take your local Wahhabis downtown for a little
<br>
therapy.
<br>
(Special prizes for neighborhoods that turn in the most.)
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; who all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a sudden become 'better' Muslims than others. These Wahhabis go even further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and accuse their own fathers of heresy, sin and unbelief. And the young
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children of the immigrants, when they grow up in this country, get exposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only to this one-sided version of Islam and are led to think that this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the only Islam. Naturally a big gap is being created every day that silence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is only widening.&quot; The young, divided between tradition and the call of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new, opt for &quot;Islamic revolution&quot; and commit themselves to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-destruction, combined with mass murder.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The same influences are brought to bear throughout the 10-million-strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Muslim community in America, as well as those in Europe. In the US, 80 per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cent of mosques are estimated by the Sufi Hisham al-Kabbani, born in Lebanon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and now living in the US, to be under the control of Wahhabi imams, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preach extremism,
</em><br>
<p>If that's really true, then what's wrong with requiring these murderous
<br>
lunatics to register with law enforcement agencies, and treating them as
<br>
severely as we treat sex offenders?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and this leads to the other point of vulnerability:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wahhabism is subsidised by Saudi Arabia, even though bin Laden has sworn to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroy the Saudi royal family. The Saudis have played a double game for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years, more or less as Stalin did with the West during the Second World War.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They pretended to be allies in a struggle against Saddam Hussein while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spreading Wahhabi ideology, just as Stalin promoted an &quot;antifascist&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coalition with the US while carrying out espionage and subversion on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American territory. The motive was the same: the belief that the West was or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is decadent and doomed.
</em><br>
<p>Where's Barry Goldwater, now that we really need him...
<br>
&quot;So tonight I want to speak about freedom. And let me remind you that
<br>
extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.&quot;

<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; One major question is never asked in American discussions of Arab terrorism:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is the role of Saudi Arabia? The question cannot be asked because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American companies depend too much on the continued flow of Saudi oil, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American politicians have become too cosy with the Saudi rulers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another reason it is not asked is that to expose the extent of Saudi and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wahhabi influence on American Muslims would compromise many Islamic clerics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the US. But it is the most significant question Americans should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asking themselves today. If we get rid of bin Laden, whom do we then have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal with? The answer was eloquently put by Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr, professor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of political science at the University of California at San Diego, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; author of an authoritative volume on Islamic extremism in Pakistan: &quot;If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US wants to do something about radical Islam, it has to deal with Saudi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arabia. The 'rogue states' [Iraq, Libya, etc] are less important in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radicalisation of Islam than Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the single most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important cause and supporter of radicalisation, ideologisation, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general fanaticisation of Islam.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From what we now know, it appears not one of the suicide pilots in New York
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Washington was Palestinian. They all seem to have been Saudis, citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Gulf states, Egyptian or Algerian. Two are reported to have been the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sons of the former second secretary of the Saudi embassy in Washington. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were planted in America long before the outbreak of the latest Palestinian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intifada; in fact, they seem to have begun their conspiracy while the Middle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; East peace process was in full, if short, bloom. Anti-terror experts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politicians in the West must now consider the Saudi connection.
</em><br>
<p>The Saudi connection, if what Stephen Schwartz writes is true, is Wahhabi
<br>
Islamo-fascism, which is the &quot;official creed&quot; of Saudi Arabia.
<br>
Gee, maybe we can get Patricia Ireland, head of America's &quot;official creed&quot;
<br>
(viz., feminazism) to lay siege to Mecca...
<br>
and may the best man win.
