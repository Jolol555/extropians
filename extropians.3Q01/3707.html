Lee said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That would only work if you had some confidence or faith in those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who liked the other candidate.  As an example, suppose that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do not believe in God, but wish to be as truth-seeking as possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It does not follow that you should &quot;move your beliefs in the direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of beliefs favored&quot; by those who are religious.  You may have concluded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that they are simply out to lunch for some reason (explanation).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, I am interested in any other brief tricks that you may know of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to assist one in being really truth-seeking.
</em><br>
<p>Lee, I don't know any &quot;tricks&quot;. I must say, though, that if I actually write 
<br>
an article on an issue I often end up with a slightly different view from 
<br>
the one I started with. That could be one kind of trick, I suppose. When I 
<br>
try to grapple honestly with opponents' counter-arguments and imagine 
<br>
counter-counters, I often find there's more to the opposing side than I 
<br>
originally thought. I may not shift my position towards that of my opponent, 
<br>
but I may be forced to look across at some other issue and find myself 
<br>
developing unexpected ideas, as I test whether I am still comfortable with 
<br>
what I originally wanted to argue.
<br>
<p>I've been writing a lot about cloning, stem cell research and genetic 
<br>
engineering, etc, in the past couple of years. In that time, I've certainly 
<br>
ended up with more sophisticated views as a result of trying to understand 
<br>
*why* my opponents put the arguments they do, ie what underlies their view 
<br>
that such arguments might be persuasive.
<br>
<p>I must say that sometimes it works the other way. For example, the more I 
<br>
try to understand what makes the libertarians on this list tick, the more I 
<br>
find myself mentally elaborating a non-libertarian political philosophy. The 
<br>
process is helping me put my finger on where I think libertarianism builds 
<br>
from metaphysical ideas about law, ethics and property which I reject (eg, I 
<br>
don't believe there are any such things as &quot;natural rights&quot;; not in the 
<br>
ontology of *my* universe). Thus, I am doomed to be the 
<br>
&quot;left-liberal&quot;-merely-bordering-on-libertarianism that I have now been 
<br>
unmasked as.  :)
<br>
<p>But then again, I would quite like to swallow libertarianism, in a way. It's 
<br>
actually a theory that has some attractions and that I could imagine taking 
<br>
up. So maybe part of the &quot;trick&quot; has been &quot;trying on&quot; the theory mentally, 
<br>
imagining how I could really justify the &quot;homesteading&quot; account of property 
<br>
etc, etc, to a sceptical third party.
<br>
<p>Cheers
<br>
<p>Russell
