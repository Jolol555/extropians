<p>Slavery was evil. It still is evil, and millions suffered and died because 
<br>
of it. No argument there.
<br>
<p>I could pick nits about the time spent as slaves - slavery has been a 
<br>
constant part of human civilization for thousands of years. Certain groups 
<br>
have been singled out for mass abuse at different times. Other ethnic 
<br>
groups around the world have been subject to rape, torture, and murder at 
<br>
the hands of bigots, not just blacks. The only big difference with black 
<br>
slavery in America is that it is close to home, and personal.
<br>
<p>As to de-facto segregation of blacks, at least here in the Chicago area it 
<br>
is heavily fueled by federally and state funded housing and welfare 
<br>
systems. The broken underclass is a direct result of Big Brother's warm 
<br>
embrace of the poorest blacks - something no other ethnic group has ever 
<br>
had in America. When you pass laws encouraging the breakup of families, and 
<br>
rewarding unemployment, what do you expect?
<br>
<p>Racism will continue at a rate directly proportional to the level of 
<br>
perceived special treatment of the despised people. As long as the US 
<br>
government continues to make some classes of people different than others 
<br>
in terms of treatment, there will be those who will despise that whole 
<br>
class of people for this reason.
<br>
<p>Forced integration and the like have had mixed success in this country. 
<br>
Black people are successfully integrating themselves into communities and 
<br>
workplaces on the merits of their own abilities and resources, just like 
<br>
immigrants from all around the world have. Personally, I have much more 
<br>
respect for a person who is willing to do something to better his position 
<br>
in life than for someone who sits around whining for more federal handouts 
<br>
because of whatever evils befell his forebears.
<br>
<p>If there had never been black slaves brought here, we would likely never 
<br>
have developed an intense racism against blacks, and African immigrants 
<br>
would have had no harder time integrating than Irish or Chinese people did 
<br>
- both groups also suffered mass discrimination when they arrived, you may 
<br>
remember.
