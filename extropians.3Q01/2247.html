<br>
<p>The discovery of decoherence, combined with the ever
<br>
more elaborate experimental demonstrations of quantum
<br>
weirdness, has caused a noticeable shift in the views of
<br>
physicists. The main motivations for introducing the notions 
<br>
of randomness and wave function collapse in the first place 
<br>
had been to explain why we perceived probabilities and not strange 
<br>
macrosuperpositions. After Everett had shown that things would 
<br>
appear random anyway and decoherence had been found to explain 
<br>
why we never perceived anything strange, much of this motivation 
<br>
was gone. Moreover, it was embarrassing that nobody had managed 
<br>
to provide a testable deterministic equation specifying precisely when 
<br>
this mysterious collapse was supposed to occur. Even though the wave 
<br>
function technically never collapses in the Everett view, it is generally 
<br>
agreed that decoherence produces an effect that looks like a collapse 
<br>
and smells like a collapse.
<br>
<p>An informal poll taken at a conference on quantum computation at the Isaac 
<br>
Newton Institute in Cambridge in July 1999 gave the following results:
<br>
<p>1. Do you believe that new physics violating the Schroedinger equation 
<br>
will make large quantum computers impossible?
<br>
1 yes, 71 no, 24 undecided
<br>
<p>2. Do you believe that all isolated systems obey the Schroedinger equation 
<br>
(evolve unitarily)? 
<br>
59 yes, 6 no, 31 undecided
<br>
<p>3. Which interpretation of quantum mechanics is closest to your own?
<br>
(a) Copenhagen or consistent histories (including postulate of explicit collapse): 4
<br>
(b) Modified dynamics (Schroedinger equation modified to give explicit collapse): 4
<br>
(c) Many worlds/consistent histories (no collapse): 30
<br>
(d) Bohm (an ontological interpretation where an auxiliary &quot;pilot wave&quot; allows 
<br>
particles to have well-defined positions and velocities): 2
<br>
(e) None of the above/undecided: 50
<br>
<p>The reader is warned of rampant linguistic confusion in this area. It is not uncommon 
<br>
that two physicists who say that they subscribe to the Copenhagen interpretation 
<br>
and themselves disagreeing about what they mean by this. Similarly, some view 
<br>
the &quot;consistent histories&quot; interpretation (in which the fundamental objects are 
<br>
consistent sets of classical histories) as a fundamentally random theory where 
<br>
God plays dice (as in the recent &quot;Physics Today&quot; article by Omnes &amp; Griffith), whereas
<br>
others view it more as a way of identifying what is classical within the deterministic 
<br>
&quot;many worlds&quot; context. Such issues undoubtedly contributed to the large &quot;undecided&quot;
<br>
vote on the last question. This said, the poll clearly suggests that it is time to
<br>
update the quantum textbooks: although these infallibly list explicit non-unitary 
<br>
collapse as a fundamental postulate in one of the early chapters, the poll indicates
<br>
that many physicists - at least in the burgeoning field of quantum computation - 
<br>
no longer take this seriously. The notion of collapse will undoubtedly retain great utility 
<br>
as a calculational recipe, but an added caveat clarifying that it is probably an not a 
<br>
fundamental process violating the Schroedinger equation could save astute students 
<br>
many hours of frustrated confusion. 
<br>
<p>The Austrian animal behaviorist Konrad Lorenz mused that important scientific 
<br>
discoveries go though three phases: first they are completely ignored, then they are 
<br>
violently attacked, and finally they are brushed aside as well-known. Although more 
<br>
quantitative experimental study of decoherence is clearly needed, it is safe to say that 
<br>
decoherence has now reached the third phase among quantum physicists | indeed, 
<br>
a large part of current quantum computing research is about finding ways to minimize 
<br>
decoherence. The poll suggests that after spending the sixties in phase 1, Everett's idea 
<br>
that physics is unitary (that there is no wave function collapse) is now shifting from 
<br>
phase 2 to phase 3, replacing the collapse interpretation as the dominant paradigm.

<br>
<p>&quot;I've said it before, I'll say it again: Can a dog collapse a state vector? 
<br>
Dogs don't use state vectors. I myself didn't collapse a state vector 
<br>
until I was 20 years old.&quot;
<br>
- David Mermin
<br>
<p>&quot;To that view, actualities seem to oat in a wider sea of possibilities 
<br>
from out of which they are chosen; and, somewhere, indeterminism says, 
<br>
such possibilities exist, and form a part of the truth.&quot;
<br>
- James, 1884 (address to the Harvard Divinity Students)
<br>
<p>&quot;Indeed one of the standard research projects for the Everettistas 
<br>
over the years has been to somehow derive the standard Born probability 
<br>
rule from the relative-state formalism itself. Everett tried his hand at it in the 
<br>
original paper . . . then Graham in his PhD thesis tried to fix that up . . . then
<br>
Benioff in several papers tried to refine that . . . and then, finally, Deutsch 
<br>
in his papers tried to argue that the project needed to be given up and that 
<br>
the Born rule should be taken as a postulate for describing the fraction of worlds 
<br>
with one property or other. The main point is that in simple Everett, 
<br>
there are no &quot;correlations&quot; in the classical, statistical sense because there are 
<br>
no joint probability functions lying around with which to work.&quot;
