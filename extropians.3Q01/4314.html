<p>
I have been lurking for quite a while, but recently ran across this article
<br>
and thought some of you might find it of interest. I apologize in advance if
<br>
this topic has already made it's way through this list.
<br>
<p>I am not a big believer in &quot;government conspiracies&quot;, but I read stories
<br>
like this one and have to ask myself &quot;what the heck were they thinking&quot;?
<br>
<p>I think that the last paragraph about the Interior Department's actions is
<br>
the most interesting and perplexing part of the article.
<br>
<p>The below story came from someone's webpage (see URL at end), but I had
<br>
previously read this same article online at Excite, Yahoo and ABCnews.com.
<br>
So I believe that the sources are somewhat reliable and the article is
<br>
authentic.

Scientists Claim Clinton Blocked Kennewick Man Research
<br>
By William McCall, AP
<br>
<p>Scientists who want to study the ancient skeleton known as Kennewick Man
<br>
contend the Clinton administration improperly tried to prevent their
<br>
research to avoid a messy debate over how the first inhabitants of North
<br>
America arrived.
<br>
<p>The government allowed &quot;inexcusable&quot; contacts between White House staff and
<br>
members of five American Indian tribes who sought to bury the skeleton, said
<br>
documents filed in federal court Monday to support the scientists.
<br>
<p>The Interior Department decided last year that the nearly complete
<br>
9,000-year-old skeleton should be given to the tribes for burial.
<br>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Interior Department said the agency will formally
<br>
respond in court on May 17, the deadline to file a response. But officials
<br>
say they did nothing wrong.
<br>
<p>&quot;We believe all contacts were proper and consistent with statute and
<br>
administrative practice,&quot; said spokeswoman Stephanie Hanna.
<br>
<p>A coalition of five Northwest tribes claimed the skeleton after it was found
<br>
in 1996 along the shoreline of the Columbia River near Kennewick, Wash. The
<br>
tribes say Kennewick Man is their ancestor and the bones should be reburied.
<br>
<p>But eight prominent scientists from universities and the Smithsonian
<br>
Institution sued for the right to study the skeleton. The scientists say
<br>
further study of Kennewick Man could reveal clues about the first humans on
<br>
the continent.
<br>
<p>Attorneys for the scientists say the Interior Department under President
<br>
Clinton and former Secretary Bruce Babbitt violated ethical standards,
<br>
alleging officials &quot;coached the coalition on how to plead its case.&quot;
<br>
<p>The scientists argue that the decision to hand over the bones did not meet
<br>
requirements of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act
<br>
because the government cannot prove the bones belong to an ancestor of any
<br>
living tribe.
<br>
<p>Attorneys Alan Schneider and Paula Barran also say the government violated
<br>
the separation of church and state by using religious tribal beliefs to make
<br>
critical decisions.
<br>
<p>They contend the government accepted tribes' religious beliefs &quot;as the
<br>
'truth' of past events&quot; contrary to scientific information, and started and
<br>
ended at least one consultation with prayer, conveying &quot;a message of
<br>
endorsement.&quot;
<br>
<p>Burying the bones would violate the First Amendment, Schneider argues,
<br>
because &quot;this skeleton is like a book&quot; that should be made available for
<br>
study.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is not for the government to determine who can read the book and what
<br>
can be done with the information that can be obtained from it,&quot; Schneider
<br>
said Wednesday.
<br>
<p>The scientists have already argued the Interior Department violated the
<br>
National Historic Preservation Act when it covered the site where the
<br>
skeleton was found with 500 tons of rocks and soil, then planted trees and
<br>
shrubs before anthropologists could conduct further excavation
