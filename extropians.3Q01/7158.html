<em>&gt;By muslim society, a girl who has premarital sex is not innocent. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By muslim society, a person who supports an infidel who fights to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;treated equally is not innocent.  In muslim society, there are believers, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and there are infidels. Infidels are second class citizens, and do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have the right to be treated like believers, though there is lip service 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to other 'children of the book' (jews and christians). An infidel who insists 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on asserting their rights over those of a believer is automatically wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Is this something you know, something you've read, something you
<br>
heard on the news?  How many muslim societies have you lived in?
<br>
If we want to be able to do a rational analysis of the situation,
<br>
we need actual facts.  
<br>
<p>What actually happens to girls who have premarital sex in, say, 
<br>
Indonesia (the world's biggest Muslim country)?  Do Muslims
<br>
automatically win in court there if the other party is non-Muslim?
<br>
Or is this all just stuff that you heard somewhere once?  Do
<br>
you think that if Pat Robertson or Jerry Falwell were running a
<br>
&quot;Christian&quot; government, that Christians would *not* be (for
<br>
instance) the only ones entitled to hold public office?
<br>
<p>Do you know what the penalty is in the Christian Bible for a
<br>
man who doesn't listen to his parents?  Death by stoning (Deut 21).
<br>
Do you know what the penalty is in the Christian Bible for a woman 
<br>
whose husband discovers she isn't a virgin?  Death by stoning (Deut 
<br>
22).  Do you know what the penalty is in the Christian Bible for a
<br>
betrothed virgin who is raped?  Death by stoning (Deut 22).  
<br>
That's the penalty for the *victim*.
<br>
<p>As I said before, you can find nasty stuff in any religion's
<br>
holy writings.  You can also find nasty behavior in any modern
<br>
society.  But as far as I know the main problem with Muslim
<br>
theocracies is that they're *theocracies*, not that they're Muslim...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;By muslim law, infidels are not presumed to be innocent until proven
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guilty, they are guilty until proven innocent.
</em><br>
<p>Are you suggesting that it would be different in a country ruled by
<br>
&quot;Christian law&quot;?  You seem to be blaming Islam for lots of vices that
<br>
it shares with the other Big Ancient Religions.  I think it's a real
<br>
bad idea to base a government around Islam, or *any other religion*.
<br>
I see no rational reason to single out Islam on this score.  To my
<br>
mind, stressing that *Islamic* theocracy is a bad idea just obscures
<br>
the more important point, that theocracy in general is a bad idea.
<br>
I have no evidence that a tamed and secularized Islam would be any
<br>
worse (or any better!) than the tamed and secularized Christianity
<br>
and Judaism that pervade the West.
<br>
<p>As Extropians, are we merely anti-Islamic?  Or are we pro-reason
<br>
and anti-superstition in whatever form?
<br>
