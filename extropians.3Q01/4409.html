Hal offered a review of my editorial and made some good counterpoints
<br>
and suggestions.  I'll only make some minor points in response.
<br>
<p>Whitesides said &quot;does not act by using electric current&quot;.
<br>
If you are aren't going to call the flow of hydrogen ions
<br>
an electric current then I think you may be splitting
<br>
some mighty thin hairs.  He specifically implies that
<br>
the decomposition of ATP is involved in the molecular
<br>
ratchet that drives the shaft and it isn't.
<br>
<p>It would make sense that ATP synthase evolved from the flagellum
<br>
rotor since mitochondria are evolved from bacteria, they produce
<br>
the same H+ ion gradient that bacteria do and there is a subcomponent
<br>
of the flagella proteins that has an ATPase activity.  A little bit
<br>
of gene shuffling and that evolves into an ATP synthase.
<br>
<p>I didn't really want to get into a discussion of the many/fat
<br>
fingers problem until I'd read Smalley's article.  Yes, I'm aware
<br>
of Ralph's work but its also obvious to anyone who has studied
<br>
biochemistry.  How does catechol-O-methyl transferase transfer
<br>
the methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine onto norepinephrine
<br>
prodicing normetanephrine if it can't properly &quot;grab&quot; and &quot;position&quot;
<br>
those two molecules relative to one another?  What about all the
<br>
hydrogenases, oxidases, kinases, dehydrogenases, deoxidases,
<br>
phosphatases, etc. that allow us to live?  The argument just
<br>
doesn't make any sense to me (this will be discussed in more
<br>
detail in the paper I'm writing so it didn't make sense to include
<br>
it in the letter).
<br>
<p>I'll take a look at WSOT.html.  One problem is I need to finish
<br>
the paper that states the argument you object to more clearly
<br>
but that comes after the nanopart assembly paper.
<br>
<p>I may not have made clear the &quot;medical&quot; connection.  It was his
<br>
statement &quot;No simple markers on the outside of most cancer cells
<br>
flag them as dangerous&quot; that raised my eyebrows.  Any medical
<br>
person reading the paper would immediately think of Prostate Specific
<br>
Antigen and/or a host of other molecules that people are currently
<br>
testing for the purpose of targeting drugs or radioactive ligands
<br>
to cancer cells.  The simple examination of the surface of
<br>
cells for the MHC proteins binding a mutated p53 fragment would take
<br>
you a long way toward towards a general means to recognize
<br>
potentially cancerous cells. (The problem with this is that
<br>
some people may have MHC alleles not particularly effective
<br>
at displaying mutant p53 fragments, so you have to actually
<br>
enter the cell and sequence p53 mRNA molecules looking for errors).
<br>
I can discuss that here, but I didn't think it would fly
<br>
in a letter to the editors...
<br>
<p>When I put the paper up on the web, I'll try to expand it to be
<br>
more complete.  My critiques are getting really backed up as
<br>
I still haven't finished my critique of Vogel's paper in
<br>
the NSF's societal impact publication.  Arghhhh....
<br>
<p>I would say a chemist's knowledge base extends up to the
<br>
range of molecules of ~1000 daltons.   The range from 150-1000 D
<br>
is usually the stomping ground of the biochemists.  Really
<br>
high molecular weight compounds are the speciality of polymer
<br>
chemists.  If you want to talk electrical current you should
<br>
be talking to a biophysicist or an electrical engineer.
<br>
If you want to talk about self-replication you want to talk
<br>
to a microbiologist or a computer scientist.  None of this
<br>
is to say that I think Whitesides is a poor scientist.
<br>
His invention of nano-imprint lithography makes him
<br>
pretty brilliant in my book.  (He won a Foresight prize
<br>
for that a few years ago.)  I just think he should read
<br>
a little more of the literature before he writes about MNT.
<br>
<p>One thing Vogel does get right in her NSF paper is that its
<br>
going to take a lot of interdisciplinary training to get the
<br>
&quot;systems engineers&quot; that Eric points out we *really* need.
<br>
