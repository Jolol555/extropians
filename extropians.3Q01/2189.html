I'm struggling through Deutsch's book &quot;The Fabric of reality&quot; at the moment,
<br>
about half way through after several months (and it's only a short book!),
<br>
but I was talking to a friend the other day about some of the ideas and it,
<br>
and he said he struggled with being able to accept that consciousness would
<br>
be able to survive millions of different versions of itself being peeled off
<br>
in different directions every second. I can't say I'd thought of it before
<br>
but I expect some version of myself had a decent answer for him.

<br>
Parallel universes are no longer a figment of our imagination. They're so
<br>
real that we can reach out and touch them, and even use them to change our
<br>
world, says Marcus Chown
<br>
<p>Flicking through New Scientist, you stop at this page, think &quot;that's
<br>
interesting&quot; and read these words. Another you thinks &quot;what nonsense&quot;, and
<br>
moves on. Yet another lets out a cry, keels over and dies.
<br>
<p>Is this an insane vision? Not according to David Deutsch of the University
<br>
of Oxford. Deutsch believes that our Universe is part of the multiverse, a
<br>
domain of parallel universes that comprises ultimate reality.
<br>
<p>Until now, the multiverse was a hazy, ill-defined concept-little more than a
<br>
philosophical trick. But in a paper yet to be published, Deutsch has worked
<br>
out the structure of the multiverse. With it, he claims, he has answered the
<br>
last criticism of the sceptics. &quot;For 70 years physicists have been hiding
<br>
from it, but they can hide no longer.&quot; If he's right, the multiverse is no
<br>
trick. It is real. So real that we can mould the fate of the universes and
<br>
exploit them.
<br>
<p>Why believe in something so extraordinary? Because it can explain one of the
<br>
greatest mysteries of modern science: why the world of atoms behaves so very
<br>
differently from the everyday world of trees and tables.
<br>
<p>The theory that describes atoms and their constituents is quantum mechanics.
<br>
It is hugely successful. It has led to computers, lasers and nuclear
<br>
reactors, and it tells us why the Sun shines and why the ground beneath our
<br>
feet is solid. But quantum theory also tells us something very disturbing
<br>
about atoms and their like: they can be in many places at once. This isn't
<br>
just a crazy theory-it has observable consequences (see &quot;Interfering with
<br>
the multiverse&quot;).
<br>
<p>But how is it that atoms can be in many places at once whereas big things
<br>
made out of atoms-tables, trees and pencils-apparently cannot? Reconciling
<br>
the difference between the microscopic and the macroscopic is the central
<br>
problem in quantum theory.
<br>
<p>The many worlds interpretation is one way to do it. This idea was proposed
<br>
by Princeton graduate student Hugh Everett III in 1957. According to many
<br>
worlds, quantum theory doesn't just apply to atoms, says Deutsch. &quot;The world
<br>
of tables is exactly the same as the world of atoms.&quot;
<br>
<p>But surely this means tables can be in many places at once. Right. But
<br>
nobody has ever seen such a schizophrenic table. So what gives?
<br>
<p>The idea is that if you observe a table that is in two places at once, there
<br>
are also two versions of you-one that sees the table in one place and one
<br>
that sees it in another place.
<br>
<p>The consequences are remarkable. A universe must exist for every physical
<br>
possibility. There are Earths where the Nazis prevailed in the Second World
<br>
War, where Marilyn Monroe married Einstein, and where the dinosaurs survived
<br>
and evolved into intelligent beings who read New Scientist.
<br>
<p>However, many worlds is not the only interpretation of quantum theory.
<br>
Physicists can choose between half a dozen interpretations, all of which
<br>
predict identical outcomes for all conceivable experiments.
<br>
<p>Deutsch dismisses them all. &quot;Some are gibberish, like the Copenhagen
<br>
interpretation,&quot; he says-and the rest are just variations on the many worlds
<br>
theme.
<br>
<p>For example, according to the Copenhagen interpretation, the act of
<br>
observing is crucial. Observation forces an atom to make up its mind, and
<br>
plump for being in only one place out of all the possible places it could
<br>
be. But the Copenhagen interpretation is itself open to interpretation. What
<br>
constitutes an observation? For some people, this only requires a
<br>
large-scale object such as a particle detector. For others it means an
<br>
interaction with some kind of conscious being.
<br>
<p>Worse still, says Deutsch, is that in this type of interpretation you have
<br>
to abandon the idea of reality. Before observation, the atom doesn't have a
<br>
real position. To Deutsch, the whole thing is mysticism-throwing up our
<br>
hands and saying there are some things we are not allowed to ask.
<br>
<p>Some interpretations do try to give the microscopic world reality, but they
<br>
are all disguised versions of the many worlds idea, says Deutsch. &quot;Their
<br>
proponents have fallen over backwards to talk about the many worlds in a way
<br>
that makes it appear as if they are not.&quot;
<br>
<p>In this category, Deutsch includes David Bohm's &quot;pilot-wave&quot; interpretation.
<br>
Bohm's idea is that a quantum wave guides particles along their
<br>
trajectories. Then the strange shape of the pilot wave can be used to
<br>
explain all the odd quantum behaviours, such as interference patterns. In
<br>
effect, says Deutsch, Bohm's single universe occupies one groove in an
<br>
immensely complicated multi-dimensional wave function.
<br>
<p>&quot;The question that pilot-wave theorists must address is: what are the
<br>
unoccupied grooves?&quot; says Deutsch. &quot;It is no good saying they are merely
<br>
theoretical and do not exist physically, for they continually jostle each
<br>
other and the occupied groove, affecting its trajectory. What's really being
<br>
talked about here is parallel universes. Pilot-wave theories are
<br>
parallel-universe theories in a state of chronic denial.&quot;
<br>
<p>Back and forth
<br>
Another disguised many worlds theory, says Deutsch, is John Cramer's
<br>
&quot;transactional&quot; interpretation in which information passes backwards and
<br>
forwards through time. When you measure the position of an atom, it sends a
<br>
message back to its earlier self to change its trajectory accordingly.
<br>
<p>But as the system gets more complicated, the number of messages explodes.
<br>
Soon, says Deutsch, it becomes vastly greater than the number of particles
<br>
in the Universe. The full quantum evolution of a system as big as the
<br>
Universe consists of an exponentially large number of classical processes,
<br>
each of which contains the information to describe a whole universe. So
<br>
Cramer's idea forces the multiverse on you, says Deutsch.
<br>
<p>So do other interpretations, according to Deutsch. &quot;Quantum theory leaves no
<br>
doubt that other universes exist in exactly the same sense that the single
<br>
Universe that we see exists,&quot; he says. &quot;This is not a matter of
<br>
interpretation. It is a logical consequence of quantum theory.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yet many physicists still refuse to accept the multiverse. &quot;People say the
<br>
many worlds is simply too crazy, too wasteful, too mind-blowing,&quot; says
<br>
Deutsch. &quot;But this is an emotional not a scientific reaction. We have to
<br>
take what nature gives us.&quot;
<br>
<p>A much more legitimate objection is that many worlds is vague and has no
<br>
firm mathematical basis. Proponents talk of a multiverse that is like a
<br>
stack of parallel universes. The critics point out that it cannot be that
<br>
simple-quantum phenomena occur precisely because the universes interact.
<br>
&quot;What is needed is a precise mathematical model of the multiverse,&quot; says
<br>
Deutsch. And now he's made one.
<br>
<p>The key to Deutsch's model sounds peculiar. He treats the multiverse as if
<br>
it were a quantum computer. Quantum computers exploit the strangeness of
<br>
quantum systems-their ability to be in many states at once-to do certain
<br>
kinds of calculation at ludicrously high speed. For example, they could
<br>
quickly search huge databases that would take an ordinary computer the
<br>
lifetime of the Universe. Although the hardware is still at a very basic
<br>
stage, the theory of how quantum computers process information is well
<br>
advanced.
<br>
<p>In 1985, Deutsch proved that such a machine can simulate any conceivable
<br>
quantum system, and that includes the Universe itself. So to work out the
<br>
basic structure of the multiverse, all you need to do is analyse a general
<br>
quantum calculation. &quot;The set of all programs that can be run on a quantum
<br>
computer includes programs that would simulate the multiverse,&quot; says
<br>
Deutsch. &quot;So we don't have to include any details of stars and galaxies in
<br>
the real Universe, we can just analyse quantum computers and look at how
<br>
information flows inside them.&quot;
<br>
<p>If information could flow freely from one part of the multiverse to another,
<br>
we'd live in a chaotic world where all possibilities would overlap. We
<br>
really would see two tables at once, and worse, everything imaginable would
<br>
be happening everywhere at the same time.
<br>
<p>Deutsch found that, almost all the time, information flows only within small
<br>
pieces of the quantum calculation, and not in between those pieces. These
<br>
pieces, he says, are separate universes. They feel separate and autonomous
<br>
because all the information we receive through our senses has come from
<br>
within one universe. As Oxford philosopher Michael Lockwood put it, &quot;We
<br>
cannot look sideways, through the multiverse, any more than we can look into
<br>
the future.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sometimes universes in Deutsch's model peel apart only locally and
<br>
fleetingly, and then slap back together again. This is the cause of quantum
<br>
interference, which is at the root of everything from the two-slit
<br>
experiment to the basic structure of atoms.
<br>
<p>Other physicists are still digesting what Deutsch has to say. Anton
<br>
Zeilinger of the University of Vienna remains unconvinced. &quot;The multiverse
<br>
interpretation is not the only possible one, and it is not even the
<br>
simplest,&quot; he says. Zeilinger instead uses information theory to come to
<br>
very different conclusions. He thinks that quantum theory comes from limits
<br>
on the information we get out of measurements (New Scientist, 17 February, p
<br>
26). As in the Copenhagen interpretation, there is no reality to what goes
<br>
on before the measurement.
<br>
<p>But Deutsch insists that his picture is more profound than Zeilinger's. &quot;I
<br>
hope he'll come round, and realise that the many worlds theory explains
<br>
where the information in his measurements comes from.&quot;
<br>
<p>Why are physicists reluctant to accept many worlds? Deutsch blames logical
<br>
positivism, the idea that science should concern itself only with objects
<br>
that can be observed. In the early 20th century, some logical positivists
<br>
even denied the existence of atoms-until the evidence became overwhelming.
<br>
The evidence for the multiverse, according to Deutsch, is equally
<br>
overwhelming. &quot;Admittedly, it's indirect,&quot; he says. &quot;But then, we can detect
<br>
pterodactyls and quarks only indirectly too. The evidence that other
<br>
universes exist is at least as strong as the evidence for pterodactyls or
<br>
quarks.&quot;
<br>
<p>Perhaps the sceptics will be convinced by a practical demonstration of the
<br>
multiverse. And Deutsch thinks he knows how. By building a quantum computer,
<br>
he says, we can reach out and mould the multiverse.
<br>
<p>&quot;One day, a quantum computer will be built which does more simultaneous
<br>
calculations than there are particles in the Universe,&quot; says Deutsch. &quot;Since
<br>
the Universe as we see it lacks the computational resources to do the
<br>
calculations, where are they being done?&quot; It can only be in other universes,
<br>
he says. &quot;Quantum computers share information with huge numbers of versions
<br>
of themselves throughout the multiverse.&quot;
<br>
<p>Imagine that you have a quantum PC and you set it a problem. What happens is
<br>
that a huge number of versions of your PC split off from this Universe into
<br>
their own separate, local universes, and work on parallel strands of the
<br>
problem. A split second later, the pocket universes recombine into one, and
<br>
those strands are pulled together to provide the answer that pops up on your
<br>
screen. &quot;Quantum computers are the first machines humans have ever built to
<br>
exploit the multiverse directly,&quot; says Deutsch.
<br>
<p>At the moment, even the biggest quantum computers can only work their magic
<br>
on about 6 bits of information, which in Deutsch's view means they exploit
<br>
copies of themselves in 26 universes-that's just 64 of them. Because the
<br>
computational feats of such computers are puny, people can choose to ignore
<br>
the multiverse. &quot;But something will happen when the number of parallel
<br>
calculations becomes very large,&quot; says Deutsch. &quot;If the number is 64, people
<br>
can shut their eyes but if it's 1064, they will no longer be able to
<br>
pretend.&quot;
<br>
<p>What would it mean for you and me to know there are inconceivably many yous
<br>
and mes living out all possible histories? Surely, there is no point in
<br>
making any choices for the better if all possible outcomes happen? We might
<br>
as well stay in bed or commit suicide.
<br>
<p>Deutsch does not agree. In fact, he thinks it could make real choice
<br>
possible. In classical physics, he says, there is no such thing as &quot;if&quot;; the
<br>
future is determined absolutely by the past. So there can be no free will.
<br>
In the multiverse, however, there are alternatives; the quantum
<br>
possibilities really happen. Free will might have a sensible definition,
<br>
Deutsch thinks, because the alternatives don't have to occur within equally
<br>
large slices of the multiverse. &quot;By making good choices, doing the right
<br>
thing, we thicken the stack of universes in which versions of us live
<br>
reasonable lives,&quot; he says. &quot;When you succeed, all the copies of you who
<br>
made the same decision succeed too. What you do for the better increases the
<br>
portion of the multiverse where good things happen.&quot;
<br>
<p>Let's hope that deciding to read this article was the right choice.
<br>
<p>Interfering with the multiverse
<br>
You can see the shadow of other universes using little more than a light
<br>
source and two metal plates. This is the famous double-slit experiment, the
<br>
touchstone of quantum weirdness.
<br>
<p>Particles from the atomic realm such as photons, electrons or atoms are
<br>
fired at the first plate, which has two vertical slits in it. The particles
<br>
that go through hit the second plate on the far side.
<br>
<p>Imagine the places that are hit show up black and that the places that are
<br>
not hit show up white. After the experiment has been running for a while,
<br>
and many particles have passed through the slits, the plate will be covered
<br>
in vertical stripes alternating black and white. That is an interference
<br>
pattern.
<br>
<p>To make it, particles that passed through one slit have to interfere with
<br>
particles that passed through the other slit. The pattern simply does not
<br>
form if you shut one slit.
<br>
<p>The strange thing is that the interference pattern forms even if particles
<br>
come one at a time, with long periods in between. So what is affecting these
<br>
single particles?
<br>
<p>According to the many worlds interpretation, each particle interferes with
<br>
another particle going through the other slit. What other particle? &quot;Another
<br>
particle in a neighbouring universe,&quot; says David Deutsch. He believes this
<br>
is a case where two universes split apart briefly, within the experiment,
<br>
then come back together again. &quot;In my opinion, the argument for the many
<br>
worlds was won with the double-slit experiment. It reveals interference
<br>
between neighbouring universes, the root of all quantum phenomena.&quot;
