</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; direction.  But that's it so far.  So no one from the side
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; opposite to mine has even tried, so far as I can tell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe you guys had a way to go.  Maybe some of us didn't.
</em><br>
<p>Still the assertions (without evidence) that your side is superior
<br>
on this question.  I have made no such assertion for weeks, probably
<br>
never:  my challenge is of a clear factual nature.  Do you understand
<br>
what I mean by &quot;the usual political tug-of-war&quot;?  People line up
<br>
on both sides, and each pulls entirely to the left or the right
<br>
without regard to the exact maximum preference of his or her own
<br>
values.  Thus people fall silent when the &quot;opposition&quot; makes a
<br>
point that they secretly agree with, but all of their &quot;team&quot; or
<br>
side does not.  They cannot bear to change &quot;sides&quot; even for a
<br>
moment---especially! if their team isn't winning.  This is called
<br>
&quot;political polarization&quot;, where everyone appears to have been
<br>
driven to the poles.
<br>
<p>I will give some concrete instructions for how you could do what
<br>
I have done (to repeat, I said &quot;Fred Reed's article was racist&quot;).
<br>
All you have to do is read through the Fred Reed article again,
<br>
remaining as calm and analytic as possible.  You are searching
<br>
for truth.  When you come to something that you sense is true,
<br>
but it also makes you sick to your stomach, stop.  Try to
<br>
articulate to yourself an extremely edited version of the 
<br>
passage, providing enough qualifiers (&quot;maybe&quot;s and &quot;if&quot;s,
<br>
and &quot;somewhat&quot;s, etc.) until you actually say, &quot;Yes, I believe
<br>
that ...&quot;.  It has to hurt.  If you have not found such a passage,
<br>
keep looking, and keep your mind open.
<br>
<p>Now, take the offending passage that, with the help of the qualifiers,
<br>
you have been able to say.  Say it until you can say it without the
<br>
qualifiers.  Then start removing the qualifiers.  But if you cannot
<br>
truthfully assert---even liberally stretching it---the passage *without*
<br>
the qualifiers, then your search is not over.
<br>
<p>This is hard to do by oneself.  I had help from Harvey Newstrom and Hal
<br>
Finney, who make precise lists of the racist places in the article.
<br>
(Now I could have done this myself, but I was as engaged in the tug-
<br>
of-war as everyone else.)  But if you give up, go back to the thread
<br>
and follow some of Mike Lorrey's or J.R. Molloy's remarks, and treat
<br>
them the same way, i.e., when one of their points *hurts* bad enough,
<br>
you know that you've probably found it.)
<br>
<p>Well, no one is going to do this.  Why should they give any aid
<br>
and comfort to beliefs that don't make them feel good?  That's
<br>
why my challenge exists.  That's why it won't be met.
<br>
<p>(If you would prefer NOT to reread Fred Reed's piece, the essay at
<br>
<a href="http://www.jeffsarchive.com/hate%20crime/The%20Color%20of%20Crime.html">http://www.jeffsarchive.com/hate%20crime/The%20Color%20of%20Crime.html</a>
<br>
which is purportedly factual---not an airy retort to Johnny Cochran---
<br>
although I have not read the whole thing, will suffice, though not
<br>
as well, because it's easy to just isolate one fact that you can
<br>
stomach, rather than a broad claim.
<br>

<br>
<p>P.S.  It will really make some people mad, but to help you out, here
<br>
again is Fred Reed's piece:

Fred Plops For Reparations
<br>
Sells Out To Johnny Cochran
<br>
<p>I see by the papers in the Yankee Capital that Johnny Cochran, and of course
<br>
Jesse and Al, are wheezing and blowing like a county-fair calliope with a
<br>
leaky boiler. They always are. This time it was about the need to pay
<br>
reparations for the ravages trala of slavery. It got me to thinking.
<br>
I hate it when that happens.
<br>
<p>Now, I know I'm hard-hearted, and mean-spirited, and no damn good. It's
<br>
probably my only virtue. But on consideration, I realized that they might be
<br>
right. The ravages of slavery do run deep, and cause motingator trouble, with
<br>
no end in sight. I decided that compensation was only reasonable. Sometimes
<br>
you don't like a conclusion, but you have to reach it. All right. I'll be a
<br>
man about it.
<br>
<p>You can pay me reparations, Johnny.
<br>
<p>To start with, I figure you owe me for three bicycles. Maybe it's a small
<br>
thing, but I'm tired of losing bicycles. Are we talking market value or
<br>
replacement? What I really want to be paid for is having to keep my latest
<br>
two-wheeler in my living room. Do you know how many times I've knocked the
<br>
fool thing over? And, oh, the scratch in my granddad's antique desk that the
<br>
brake lever made. What's that worth?
<br>
<p>Call it three grand. OK? Direct deposit would be nice.
<br>
<p>But . . . how do we dollarize cultural retrogression? God knows I appreciate
<br>
your offer of reparations, but I'm having trouble with the arithmetic. Help
<br>
me.
<br>
<p>A few years back, my middle-school daughter brought home a horrendously
<br>
misspelled science hand-out. Now, Johnny: You and I both know that it's easy
<br>
to make a typo, and write &quot;phenylkeetone&quot; instead of &quot;phenylketone.&quot; But
<br>
&quot;feemelkeebome&quot; is stretching it. The errors were of this sort. An
<br>
understanding of chemistry clearly had never rippled the serene surface of the
<br>
woman's mind.
<br>
<p>Without thinking, I asked, &quot;What color is your teacher?&quot; (If I had thought
<br>
carefully, I would have asked, &quot;What color is your teacher?&quot;) My daughter
<br>
responded with an anguished, &quot;Da-d-d-d-y!&quot; She had made the connection, but
<br>
knew she wasn't supposed to.
<br>
<p>I've got no problem with black teachers, if they are competent. No problem at
<br>
all. But a teacher who is too ignorant to spell her subject, and too lazy to
<br>
use a dictionary, ought to be flipping burgers. Simple burgers, with no moving
<br>
parts. Thing is, we can't fire ignorant teachers, Johnny, because of the
<br>
lingering effects of slavery. I can yell at an ignorant white teacher, but not
<br>
at a black one. To expect blacks to meet standards is racist. You can send me
<br>
the price of four years of tuition in a private school outside the country.
<br>
<p>What's the cost of permanent welfare? Subsidized everything? Enormous police
<br>
departments? What do you figure? Just add it to your tab. Have you thought
<br>
about setting up an endowment?
<br>
<p>But here's a large ravage of slavery, Johnny: Fear.
<br>
<p>What price do we put on looking over our shoulders? On watching to be sure we
<br>
don't go one subway stop too far? Warning our girlfriends not to drive on
<br>
certain streets? Checking the clientele of Seven-Eleven before going in at
<br>
night?
<br>
<p>People in, say, Switzerland can walk their streets after dark. We can't. Why?
<br>
What have we got that they don't, that might cause fear?
<br>
<p>Elvis impersonators, Johnny. Yep. Switzerland doesn't have any Elvis
<br>
impersonators. Check for yourself.
<br>
<p>What's fear worth? Is it a minimum-wage job? Forty-hour week or twenty-four
<br>
hours a day? Benefits? Seniority pay as people grow older, weaker, and less
<br>
able to defend themselves? You see the actuarial difficulty. Accounting is a
<br>
more difficult trade than you might think.
<br>
<p>The white guy beaten to death 100 yards from my door last year - they never
<br>
caught the killers, but - what you reckon, Johnny? Do you figure it was white
<br>
Presbyterian women from the old-ladies' home? That's my guess. That's who
<br>
usually does it. Anyway, you can send me $540 for the Sig 9mm pistol I bought
<br>
after blacks started moving into the neighborhood and crime went up. And ammo,
<br>
carry permit, Hydra-Shock rounds.
<br>
<p>Now, millions of honest blacks might write and say, &quot;Fred, we aren't
<br>
criminals. Why should we pay for what other blacks do?&quot; Splendid question. But
<br>
of course whites say, &quot;We don't have any slaves. Why should we pay for what
<br>
some other whites did?&quot; If it is a reasonable question for blacks to ask, as
<br>
indeed it is, why isn't it a reasonable question for whites to ask?
<br>
<p>But while you are in a mood to pay up, Johnny, let me introduce a useful
<br>
concept: Civilizational rent. You'll like this. It's such a good idea.
<br>
<p>A culture is essentially software. No? Sure, there are physical embodiments:
<br>
positron-emission scanners, high-bypass turbofans, radar with Doppler
<br>
beam-sharpening. Yet basically a culture is a body of knowledge, like
<br>
Microsoft Word. (All right, throw in values. But I don't want to make this too
<br>
difficult.)
<br>
<p>White guys invented these things at considerable cost. We had to. Europe doesn
<br>
't have much low-hanging fruit, and it gets cold in the north. So generations
<br>
of people that I'm sure you're familiar with - Newton, Leibniz, Galois, Gauss,
<br>
Carnot, Dirac - did work that led to all kinds of useful . . . you know . .
<br>
stuff.
<br>
<p>Western civilization, it's called.
<br>
<p>As a result of slavery, you have been using our civilization without a
<br>
license. (I know: You're having trouble with the idea of implied retroactive
<br>
acceptance of a license I invented five minutes ago. Microsoft would grasp it
<br>
in a heartbeat. Anyway, I'm writing the column.)
<br>
<p>Further, you've been using it for a long time, Johnny. Air-conditioning.
<br>
Roads. Writing. The wheel. Complicated stuff like that. Medicine. Tractors.
<br>
Shoes. Houses. I've spent time in Africa, where people live in stick things
<br>
that look as if a Cub Scout had built a campfire and forgotten to light it.
<br>
You're getting a deal here, Johnny.
<br>
<p>I don't wish stick houses on anyone. I'm glad you have the benefits of
<br>
electricity, clothes, and daytime TV. I'd love to see blacks study, earn
<br>
degrees on their merits, prosper. Think of the trouble it would save. But - as
<br>
suggested by your manly desire to pay reparations -- you owe us licensing
<br>
fees. Granted, it's hard to set a price on a culture. But if Microsoft Office
<br>
goes for $250 at fire-sale prices, I guess a whole civilization is cheap at
<br>
$100K a copy.
<br>
<p>I believe we can do business, Johnny. I hope so. I can use the money.
<br>
