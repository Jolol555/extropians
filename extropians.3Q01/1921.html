<p>Open Source - Says Who?
<br>
by Dave Avery
<br>
<em>&gt; GPL - Sounds Good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The two most common source code licenses are GPL and BSD.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  GPL stands for General Public License. GPL supporters (like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  LINUX crowd) often talk about how nice and open they are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and that they'll give you their code. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  This sounds nice, and like they are sharing freely, but be sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to look this gift horse in the mouth. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I think of it like this -- GPL code is &quot;open&quot;, but it has cooties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If their code ever touches yours, your code has cooties too,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and thus has to be shared with the world (whether you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to or not). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  You can use this code, if and only if you agree to the terms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  which includes giving up all rights to anything you produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that ever got near their code, and that your code will carry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the GPL license around as well since it will be distributed with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  their code. If you have any part of your code that you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to keep private or you consider intellectual property, then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  can't easily use GPL. In other words, it's all or nothing. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  So with GPL you don't have a choice to share. You have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  someone with a gun telling you to share or else. Some call
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that open, others call it extortion. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Better Share Dance 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  On the other hand, BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution, a.k.a.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Berkeley UNIX) is far more open and basically says that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  can use the code in whatever way you want, but please be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  nice and give back. Not that you have to give back, and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that you will be hunted down and flogged if you don't. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  You don't even have to sign away rights to any code that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ever got near a BSD license. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If you want to truly give or get something without conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (or with fewer conditions), then the BSD license is far better. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  BSD is giving -- GPL is bartering (at best). BSD takes the high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  road and trusts you to share, and assumes that you're a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  person and that you'll give back. GPL takes the low road,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  assumes that you are a bad person, and that the only way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  get you to share is with force. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But be careful about stating this publicly or you will get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  thousands of angry e-mails from annoyed purists who think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that the end justifies the means, and GPL is a good way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  force others to be as free and open as they are, or else. 
</em><br>
<p>end quote...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't understand your hatred of the guy. He is an honorable (if somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impatient) person, with an incredibly sharp mind. In many ways the computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industry owes him a debt. Open-source is revitalising the industry. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secretive industry would have ended up suffocating itself.
</em><br>
<p>Open-source existed before Stallman, and was destined for its present
<br>
place if Stallman never existed. The only reason Open-source has become
<br>
as big as it is is because of Linus Torvalds. If GPL didn't exist, he
<br>
would likely have placed linux under BSD instead of GPL, and people
<br>
would still be as psyched about open source, and there would be far less
<br>
low trust commie types running roughshod over the motives of anyone who
<br>
didn't agree with them in the movement.
<br>
<p>Look, Linus screwed up. He put linux under GPL as an idealistic kid, a
<br>
time in life when most of us think we are commies for various spans of
<br>
time, and then grow out of it at faster or slower rates than others.
<br>
Most of us try to rationalize away any bad things we did in the name of
<br>
our commie ideals during that period. Very few are willing to openly say
<br>
&quot;hey, I screwed up, I'm sorry&quot;. Human beings are rationalizing creatures
<br>
that way, and we don't want to be bad people. Linus was not aware of the
<br>
original reasons why Stallman wrote the GPL any more than American 60's
<br>
hippies (or the atomic spies like Fuchs and the Rosenbergs) were aware
<br>
of the heinous crimes of Stalin (I'll leave aside the interesting
<br>
phonetic similarities....), so blaming Linus for anything, or looking
<br>
negatively at his accomplishments is wrong. That doesn't mean we
<br>
shouldn't rationally and honestly admit what Stallman did and why he did
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>It's illustrative that GPL is a low trust contract, while BSD is a high
<br>
trust contract. I think its rather obvious, based upon my other writings
<br>
on this list, which one I prefer and is more useful toward building true
<br>
freedom in software.
<br>
<p>Besides just BSD, there is also MIT X which pre-exists Stallman, and
<br>
which does not have its punitive characteristics. Brett Glass also
<br>
illustrates the problems with not only the GPL, but the new LGPL, which
<br>
is supposed to be called the 'Libary General Public License' for use in
<br>
cloning Windows under the Mono project, but it's indicative of
<br>
Stallman's true sentiments that he calls this the 'Lesser General Public
<br>
License'. 
<br>
<p>As Brett Glass writes:
<br>
<a href="http://www.osopinion.com/perl/story/?id=12037">http://www.osopinion.com/perl/story/?id=12037</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Born Free 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If the actual goal of Mono is to provide freedom, it should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  license its libraries (and other components) under a truly free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  license, such as the MIT X license, which allows commercial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  development and commercial reuse of code. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  To do so would demonstrate that Mono is not motivated by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  vendetta against Microsoft (or against more ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  commercial developers), but rather by a spirit of true freedom.
