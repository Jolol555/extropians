</em><br>
<p><p>What for?  Why should they be replaced unless there is
<br>
a tacit assumption that religiosity (is this a word and what
<br>
precisely is its meaning?) is utterly false.  I do not
<br>
grant this assumption.  I do consider the concept of 'sin'
<br>
useless
<br>
as do many religious traditions.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The second claim is that traditional religious beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are false, and therefore need to be debunked.  Few on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list with argue with that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What exactly is meant?  The statement is too broad.

<em>&gt; &gt; You are entitled to your opinions of course but do not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; confused that they are any more than that.  &quot;Sin&quot; is a concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of some (not all) religions and actually has a more general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meaning of having broken one or more moral maxims (of whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; source).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But we are not short of other words that more clearly describe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the breaking of moral maxims, certainly not in English anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So one cannot help but suspect that people who wish to use the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word &quot;sin&quot; in a serious way have something more on their plate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't really know what it could be, unless, as I said before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pander to people with traditional religious beliefs.  Please
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell me what it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Then why throw this one out?  Pandering?  Do you not see that we
<br>
&quot;pander&quot; here all the time to opposite beliefs?  I personally
<br>
have no use for the concept of 'sin' as it implies guilt and
<br>
having angered God and all the rest.  I don't think religious
<br>
stuff actually operates that way.  But spirituality and religion
<br>
is far broader than such a word that some sects put a lot of
<br>
meaning in and others don't.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Spirituality has many levels of meaning and mostly seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more fundamental than religions.  Of course you are welcome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to substitute religiosity if you wish and to make it mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whatever you need it to mean to thoroughly disapprove of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure what this means, except possibly to allege that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; J.R. wants to thoroughly disapprove of something.  Yes, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is for sure true that spirituality has many levels of meaning.
</em><br>
<p>The meaning is pretty obvious.  You got it in one. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's one of the reasons that the term is inherently confusing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now among people whose beliefs are very similar, and so where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little or no confusion is liable to occur, use of the term is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite warranted, of course.  But here, where we would like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine (I hope) just what substance lies behind use of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term, I for one want to understand what drives atheists and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materialists to ever use it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am neiter an atheist (although I don't believe in a God
<br>
remotely like many theists do) or a materialist (in the
<br>
dictionary meaning of the word) so I can't help you.  But why
<br>
the tacit assumption that only atheists and materialists need be
<br>
consulted to understand if spirituality has value?  One of the
<br>
most profoundly spiritual people I know is utterly atheistic. 
<br>
Original Buddhism is atheistic.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Is it a retreat if one finds oneself to be honestly spiritual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and/or religious without for a moment letting go of science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and its achievements?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That sounds quite admirable, but contains a claim that is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close to an accusation.  It firstly claims that there is some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substance to being &quot;honestly spiritual&quot; or &quot;honestly religious&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even though accepting everything that we learn through science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This still needs to be explicated.  The hidden pronouncement is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that atheists/materialists who denigrate religious beliefs (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hence, easily, &quot;religiosity&quot;) are perhaps somewhat crippled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally, or at least lead impoverished lives of some description.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now we total-atheists/materialists---who claim that &quot;spirituality&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and &quot;religiousity&quot; do not describe us well---should be treated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as adults who are quite capable of owning up to actual 
</em><br>
<p>There was no such implication.  I was rather asserting that it
<br>
is quite possible to understand and fully hold science in high
<br>
accord and utterly capable of explaining all material phenomenon
<br>
and still be spiritual and religious without that being a matter
<br>
of intellectual dishonesty as was initially implied. 
<br>
<p>I do not think atheists or materialists are impoverished.  After
<br>
all I spent more than a little time in that position myself.  I
<br>
fully understand it.  It is not my home, not where I find my
<br>
life most rich and fulfilling, but I certainly don't denigrate
<br>
that position at all.
<br>
Far from it.  As a minister friend once said in a sermon (and
<br>
woke a lot of people up) &quot;For most people and the way they hold
<br>
their beliefs, becoming an atheist is a huge improvement!&quot;  The
<br>
point was not that atheism is so terrible or not-as-good but
<br>
that atheism requires a deep examination, honesty, integrity and
<br>
caring that many non-atheists do not exhibit.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;shortcomings;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it is incumbent upon those who think that we are lacking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something to be very explicit.  If you're right, we can handle it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now I've argued with a very close friend for literally decades
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about this issue of religiousity.  He claims, as several here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have, to be spiritual.  He is not as ready as J. R. Malloy or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself (or Robert Ingersoll) to speak up about the falseness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of traditional religous beliefs.  A number of famous people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have claimed to be &quot;religious&quot;, where I just cannot see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applicability of the term---so this is a familiar conundrum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, so this discussion has gone on ever since Darwin, at least,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suspect.  Perhaps there is not only a gene for religiousity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but a separate gene that causes one to find the terms &quot;religious&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and &quot;spiritual&quot; appealing, and causes one to wish very strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to apply them to oneself regardless of one's actual beliefs?
</em><br>
<p>Of course there just aren't enough genes to cover such bogus
<br>
explanations.
