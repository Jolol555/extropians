</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the conventional sense of a bank that you or I might walk into and ask
</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; implementing the international relations policies of the governments that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back them. They're not free agents in the economic sphere!
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but neither do they represent just one government. Here in the US,
<br>
it has been a general consensus that the IMF has been a disaster for
<br>
decades, acting as a tool of third world dicatators (which, you may
<br>
note, outnumbered western countries for many years) for their personal
<br>
aggrandizement. It always seemed that it was one more third worlder
<br>
politician in charge of the IMF who couldn't seem to resist hiring all
<br>
of his siblings, cousins, and nephews as well (kind of like how the
<br>
International Olympic Committee is run), and continued to perpetuate
<br>
easy credit terms for third world despots to buy more weapons from
<br>
France, the USSR, China, or North Korea.
<br>
<p>Now that we're getting the IMF back under western control, all of the
<br>
third world despots, socialist movements, and other cronyist groups (and
<br>
their enablers here in the US and europe) that are now losing out on the
<br>
gravy train are pissed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The 19% rate is simply a disinscentive against borrowing for such a dumb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; purpose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nah. 19% interest rates are _low_ by the standards of British credit card
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accounts. You think the credit card bureaus are trying to discourage users
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from borrowing at those rates? 19%, from another angle, is a rate designed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to give a decent profit to the lender, when there's some risk that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; borrower will go bust. Yes, it's a disincentive against borrowing -- but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if the belt-tightening alternative goes hand in glove with a revolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and blood in the streets, what are you going to do?
</em><br>
<p>19% is generally normal for personal consumer credit cards, and it is
<br>
that high specifically to act as a disincentive against carrying a
<br>
balance for more than a few months. Intergovernmental loans between
<br>
stable and trustworthy governments and banking systems (like those
<br>
between western countries and interstate and interbank loans here in the
<br>
US) are generally in the low single digits.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What interests me is that a 19% interest rate -- in what is basically a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repayable loan from one government to another -- looks like a hook with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; barb on it. There's *no* *way* that a recipient government can boost their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic growth, on the basis of a loan, sufficiently to repay at 19% per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annum.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. Which is why it is a disincentive against borrowing. An intelligent
<br>
government would say, &quot;Hmmm, do we borrow money at 19% to pay off a loan
<br>
we already have at 12%? No, that's a dumb idea, lets just tighten our
<br>
belts and get this 12% loan paid off without borrowing. When we do,
<br>
they'll offer us 12% terms again.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (The fundamental difference between the way you're thinking about it, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way I'm thinking about it, is that you're thinking in terms of a pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free market system, with transactions between individuals who are rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and free. I'm thinking in terms of the US State Department and the UK Foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Office lurking up a dark alleyway and mugging some poor bastard who can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fight back, in order to cut the price of bananas.)
</em><br>
<p>I look at it the other way:
<br>
<p>The local Jamaican Posse Banana Market sells bananas for $10 a bunch,
<br>
while my cousin Pedro can sell his own bananas for $5 a bunch, except
<br>
that the Posse comes and forces him at gun point to charge $11 per
<br>
bunch, which causes everyone to continue to buy from the Jamaican Posse.
<br>
I get my own sheriff to go and make the Posse stop forcing Pedro to
<br>
charge so much, so I say &quot;everything's gonna be alright&quot; for everyone
<br>
now. The Posse is pissed cause they can't keep so many layabouts on the
<br>
dole for muscle in the Posse at the lower market price of $5 a bunch,
<br>
and they say &quot;I wanna shoot the sheriff&quot; and come to my bank to ask for
<br>
a loan for money to keep the Posse's members paid so they can go shoot
<br>
Sheriff John Brown. I say, &quot;sure, but you gotta pay it back at 19%
<br>
interest&quot;. They say, &quot;But mon, we ain't makin' no profit on the money we
<br>
borrow, since we're just using it to pay layabouts, how can we earn that
<br>
19% interest?&quot; I say,&quot;You can earn that interest by investing that money
<br>
instead in capital equipment that you can use to turn a profit for you.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      :
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Whether it's turtles all the way down or not is irrelevant. Keep in mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm not too sympathetic toward the IMF either, but at least they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; starting to get their act together. There are plenty of measures that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; country like Jamaica can take to pull itself out of the hole by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bootstraps. For example, they can drastically revise their banking and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; taxation laws to encourage an influx of deposits from overseas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; investors, and structure their social welfare programs to encourage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people to obtain long term birth controls like Norplant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To encourage an influx of deposits from overseas investors, you need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to offer something to invest _in_. Last time I looked down at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supermarket, bananas were cheaper than potatoes. (When I was a wee kid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were a luxury fruit!) That implies that if you put yourself in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saddle of the Jamaican government, you need to re-tool the economy to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something profitable. But you need to do so on a budget of approximately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fifty cents, because you've got nothing to work with -- no skilled workers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no infrastructure, no high-level education system, and nothing but bananas.
</em><br>
<p>The fortunate thing is that a banana is possibly the world's most
<br>
perfect food. Nobody's gonna starve in Jamaica. Or perhaps it's
<br>
unfortunate. As demonstrated in Jarod Diamond's &quot;Guns, Germs, and
<br>
Steel&quot;, cultures which have had too easy a time producing their food
<br>
with little technology generally evolve into casual societies that are
<br>
generally unproductive. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Jamaican birth rate isn't a major problem; at 18.51/1000 population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (in 1999) it's higher than the US (at 14.2/1000), but much lower than most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the third world; just about everywhere in Africa and the Middle East
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is in the 35-45 range, for example.
</em><br>
<p>But as with any numbers that compound, small differences equate to big
<br>
differences in actual growth. keep in mind that Jamaica has a far lower
<br>
mortality rate than most of Africa...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I understand completely that being in a situation where you have a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; percent of the population who are unskilled, unemployable, and unwilling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to fix that, you have a major mess on your hands, one that requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; either war, famine, epidemic, or other natural disaster to fix.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's arrant nonsense. For starters, you can make just about 80% of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population willing to learn if you can give them a positive incentive for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change. For seconds, you're embracing a negativistic fatalism about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human condition that is, dare I say it, rather at odds with extropianism.
</em><br>
<p>Funny how I'm now being the cultural relativist. The problem is that
<br>
perpetual protectionism is a disincentive to change, and the result of
<br>
true negativist fatalism about the human condition. Protectionism
<br>
implies that those who are protected are inherently incapable or
<br>
unwilling to compete on an equal footing. I don't accept that, and many
<br>
Jamaicans are hard working. Those in Britain decrying 'American
<br>
imperialism' need to examine how British imperialism has hamstrung the
<br>
Jamaican people....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we judge Europe in the 12th century by your yardstick of &quot;unskilled,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unemployable, and unwilling to fix that&quot; then it comes off a hell of a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse than Jamaica today.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it was, but a convenient thing called The Plague helped balance the
<br>
accounts there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The purpose of the 19% loan is to send a price signal to the rulers that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they can no longer fix today's problems by borrowing from the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nope, the purpose of the 19% loan is to send a diplomatic signal to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rulers saying &quot;we've got you where we want you, now lube up and bend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over&quot;. The 19% interest rate wasn't dictated for commercial reasons, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for political ones.
</em><br>
<p>For political reasons like &quot;You folks are not going to get out of this
<br>
mess by borrowing your way out, you've got to work for it.&quot; Nobody ever
<br>
found their way out of bankruptcy by borrowing more money.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thirdly -- and this is the most important point -- conditions attached to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the loans are being used as instruments of state power. That is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; real bad problem here; the recipient of the loan isn't free to use it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; productively.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No, they are not free to spend it on social welfare programs. There is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nothing wrong with a person to attach stipulations on how THEIR money is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; going to be used by those they lend it to. A bank would get mighty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pissed if I took out an auto loan and used the money on a vacation to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Fiji.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Social welfare programs include building schools and training workers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in new skills. (What was that you said about &quot;unskilled, unemployable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and unwilling to fix that&quot;?)
</em><br>
<p>Education isn't social welfare, public education is simply monopolism.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; We _know_ that third world countries can develop. Look at South Korea or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vietnam circa 1945, and look at South Korea today. Look at Thailand. Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; China, today, in the throes of routine 7% annual growth.  Hell, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Poland or the Czech republic fit the mold to some extent (at least in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparison to Russia).  The question we should be asking is why places
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like Jamaica or Zambia don't follow suit. I don't buy the argument that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the locals are too stupid or lazy to work; hacking bananas off trees for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; piece-rate on a plantation isn't a cushy life.
</em><br>
<p>I don't buy that assessment either. Note however: the economic stars you
<br>
cite never found their real economic stardom until they dropped
<br>
protectionist trade policies. Jamaica is still protected by British
<br>
imperialism...
