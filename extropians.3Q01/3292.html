<em>&gt;&gt;Sorry, but I respectfully and completely disagree. Our current concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of the singularity is grounded in science, not philosophy. It is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;simple forward extrapolation of well-understood phenomena.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since we disagree completely (but respectfully) let us take this in stages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's work on the concept of transhumanism first, and then worry about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connection (if any) with a singularity. The understanding I offered above of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism has a teleological and an ethical component. Perhaps we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree on this. Your post emphasizes the predictive nature of science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps your understanding of transhumanism is similar to Robin Hansons:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Transhumanism is the idea that new technologies are likely to change the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world so much in the next century or two that our descendants will in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways no longer be &quot;human.&quot; &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (This quote is from Ander's site). This definition seems more in line with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your comments than the one I offered. For myself, I not sure how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enlightening it is to concentrate simply on the likelihood of various future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; histories.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, my perspective tracks Ander's and Robin's, except that I think the 
<br>
time scale is much shorter. I take a technological singularity in the
<br>
(historically) very near future as a given, and I don't think human
<br>
ethics have any relevance after the singularity. When I first
<br>
encountered the concept of the singularity, I speculated a lot
<br>
about the transhumanity that would result. I now firmly believe that
<br>
such speculation is unproductive, analogous to speculation on
<br>
life in heaven or hell. I'm interested only in the events leading
<br>
up to the singularity, and actions we humans can take to mitigate any
<br>
problems in this, the last period of human history while accelerating
<br>
the singularity. I am not really a &quot;transhumanist.&quot; I'm a human who
<br>
believes the singularity is inevitable and probably &quot;good.&quot; You will
<br>
need to find someone else to discuss and debate the ethics of
<br>
transhumanity with you. Enjoy.
