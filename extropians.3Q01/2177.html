Regarding Austin and other positivists of his ilk, I would argue that they 
<br>
did not in fact practice what they preached in that they imported into their 
<br>
theories a preference for statist over other types of law.  Here's Austin in 
<br>
his own words:  &quot;[E]very law simply and strictly so called, is set directly 
<br>
or circuitously by a monarch or sovereign number to a person or persons in a 
<br>
state of subjection to its author.&quot;  John Austin, The Province of 
<br>
Jurisprudence Determined 202 (Noonday, H.L.A. Hart ed 1954).  A better, more 
<br>
honest positivism would, I think, recognize that laws come from a variety of 
<br>
sources, some statist and some not.
<br>
<p>Regarding Hayek's alleged fatalism, I think that his writings cannot at all 
<br>
support the view that we must simply accept as the result of evolution 
<br>
whatever results from the competition among societies.  He, like other legal 
<br>
naturalists, adopts a more reflective and critical methodology, one that 
<br>
draws on deep historical studies to evaluate the ability of various legal 
<br>
systems to support peaceful and prosperous social life.  It's a conditional 
<br>
mode of reasoning, of course; if you don't like peace and prosperity, you 
<br>
needn't like things like property rights and the rule of law.  But it just so 
<br>
happens that most humans dislike suffering poverty and violence.  
<br>
Consequently, legal naturalism proves pretty convincing. 
<br>
<p>Regarding Rand, I would class her with theists, Kantians, and others who try 
<br>
to justify natural law analytically.  I respect such efforts, though I've yet 
<br>
to find any such a prior justification of law or ethics convincing.  More to 
<br>
the point, for present purposes, such analytic approaches contrast sharply 
<br>
with the empirical approach adopted by Hume, Smith, Hayek, and other &quot;legal 
<br>
naturalists.&quot;
<br>
<p>The point, again, in brief: You can take both a positivist view of law and 
<br>
support a form of natural rights.
<br>
<p><p>In a message dated 7/25/01 5:14:35 AM, Daniel Ust writes, in relevant part:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My understanding of thinkers like John Austin
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is that by legal positivism they mean what laws that exist are ones that must
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be and questions of what should be are unimportant.  It's possible, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this context, to have a legal positivist inside a libertarian society 
</em><br>
agreeing
<br>
. . .
<br>
<em>&gt;Aside from the problem with Hayekian social theory -- a theory I generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agree with -- I've never maintained that natural law or individual rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have to be based on those things.  In fact, my mentioning of the Objectivist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;view later in the same email should have led you to believe otherwise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(That said, I would not be so hard on Kant.  I don't see him and Rand as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the intellectual rivals she would have us believe they are.)
</em><br>
. . .
<br>
<em>&gt;And now the problem with Hayek. . . .  we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cannot sheepishly accept whatever is as be the thing that should have been.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;To do so only leads to circularity. 
</em><br>
