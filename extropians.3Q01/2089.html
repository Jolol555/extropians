Miriam,
<br>
<p>It isn't exactly like I was just pulling this out of my ass -- the problem
<br>
is simple and well-described.  And it isn't just TB, there is a laundry list
<br>
of illegal immigration disease vectors.  For many diseases, illegal
<br>
immigration is *the* disease vector in the US and Canada.  We normally
<br>
screen legal immigrants and fix any infectious disease problems to protect
<br>
the general population.  By definition illegal aliens don't have any health
<br>
screening at all.
<br>
<p>The incidence of diseases such as TB and Hep-B among illegal aliens is well
<br>
documented by both the U.S. and Canadian governments.  The fiscal, health
<br>
impact, and infection patterns among the general population due to illegal
<br>
immigration disease vectors is also well-documented.  We aren't talking
<br>
about illegal immigrants being infected at a rate of 1-2%, but in the 10-50%
<br>
range.  The recent spike in the illegal immigrant population of the U.S. has
<br>
lead to a large spike in the incidence of the same diseases in the general
<br>
population, concentrated in the regions where illegal immigrants live in
<br>
numbers.  Disease control is one of the best arguments for immigration
<br>
controls.  As an example, in British Columbia, an incidence of Hep-B in
<br>
Chinese illegals of 30+% has translated into the general population having
<br>
an incidence of 1%, which is much higher than for provinces that don't have
<br>
illegal immigration problems.  Unfortunately, the unusually high infection
<br>
rates of this and other diseases are seriously straining the public health
<br>
care system in BC, to the detriment of everyone.
<br>
<p>I find it really difficult to blame Americans in general for illegal aliens
<br>
having TB or whatever.  The US government (and the taxpayers by extension)
<br>
has spent inordinate amounts of money to eradicate these diseases within
<br>
their borders, and it would seem prudent to protect that expensive
<br>
investment.  
<br>
<p>Mexico could fix their TB problem, but then that would require fixing a
<br>
bunch of other problems that they apparently aren't too inclined to fix.
<br>
