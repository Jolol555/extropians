As documented in this NY Times article:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/24/arts/24SALA.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/24/arts/24SALA.html</a>
<br>
there is a special running this week on Evolution
<br>
and Darwinism on PBS.  Is supposed to start at 8 PM EST.
<br>
TVGuide.com says its at 8:00 PM PST as well.
<br>
<p>It sounds like it is trying to take the bull by the horns
<br>
and wrestle with the conflict between science and religius
<br>
faith.  For example:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the subject is a closed topic to many evangelical Christians. &quot;Adam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is my ancestor and not a chimpanzee,&quot; are the lyrics sung at a church
</em><br>
<em>&gt; service in Canton, Ohio, led by a minister named Ken Ham. &quot;If the Bible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets it wrong in biology, then why should I trust the Bible when it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talks about morality and salvation?&quot; he says in an interview.
</em><br>
<p>One good reason to believe the Bible about morality is because the
<br>
&quot;Ten Commandments&quot; are largely consistent with &quot;morality&quot; that derives
<br>
from evolution and natural selection as well.  (Of course we know that
<br>
&quot;salvation&quot; is the dark horse -- unlikely to win the race unless this
<br>
is a simulation.)
<br>
<p>I'll quote J. R. Molloy:
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Moral principles&quot; are exactly what combatants hide behind to justify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their grab for territory and resources. Morality derives from biology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See: <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/98apr/biomoral.htm">http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/98apr/biomoral.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p>My hat is off to him for posting this link as it helped me to clarify
<br>
my thoughts regarding morality, the intrinsic value of human life,
<br>
and transhumanist/extropian perspectives.  I highly recomend that
<br>
everyone on the list take the time to read this summary (unless
<br>
perhaps they have already read Wilson's &quot;Consilience&quot;.
