I apologize if it is taboo too post a gun thread, I don't know the rules if
<br>
there are any.
<br>

-----------------------------------
<br>
Thanks Mikael:
<br>
<p>That was very honest, and I agree that it is largely a frame of reference
<br>
thing,
<br>
I have close friends, who I consider very bright and honest,  that feel much
<br>
the same as you.
<br>
<p>I think it is a grave responsibility to own a gun, and if anyone has doubts
<br>
about themselves having one, I agree they should refrain, I think that
<br>
people can and typically do overestimate their capacity of responsibility,
<br>
and treat raw power frivolously.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately I do not live in a peaceful society, its is dangerous and
<br>
becoming more so, I anticipate social order will eventually and  inevitably
<br>
decay, and the police forces absolutely cannot be counted on in any measure
<br>
to protect me or my family, so the burden rests squarely on me to shoulder,
<br>
and I can't let my family down.
<br>
<p>Owning a gun, and carrying it lawfully with me in public (concealed) makes
<br>
me even more cautious believe it or not, its makes me hyper-alert, the
<br>
negative legal ramifications of &quot;making a mistake&quot;, might be less preferable
<br>
than dying.
<br>
<p>I think that gun grabbing is not a necessarily a socialist issue, the
<br>
socialist position could well embrace self armament, and the so called
<br>
&quot;rightwing&quot; could just as easily be gungrabbers, I think its a ruse.
<br>
<p>I put allot of emphasis on personal empowerment and responsibility, for me,
<br>
rights and responsibilities are mutually dependant.
<br>
<p>I have read the founders of the USA emphasized that this system of
<br>
government they created was only sustainable if the People held to a strict
<br>
moral or ethical code, I think we are witnessing the proof of their
<br>
assertions.

<p><p><em>&gt; I take this in private -- since I've heard enough of what guns on extropy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not to go there. The reason I've stayed silent since my entering the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debate is that I realized that I was in over my head...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Does Mikael belive that if he were armed, (actualy more armed because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everyone is already armed) he would commit more violence and
</em><br>
criminality?
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If not, why would he presume that others would?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I know that I'm not at all times as mentally stable as I am right
</em><br>
now.
<br>
<em>&gt; I know that my judgement is not at all times as high as I wish it to be.
</em><br>
And
<br>
<em>&gt; I know, that given a firearm, a very strainful situation and a percieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat I might very well commit more violence and criminality than I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without the gun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that carrying the gun might very well lead me to feel so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overconfident that I might put myself in situations where I cannot pull
</em><br>
out,
<br>
<em>&gt; and my poor judgement leads me to so severe a fight that I might in the
</em><br>
very
<br>
<em>&gt; worst case actually use the gun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also believe that not carrying a gun gives me enough of caution not to
</em><br>
go
<br>
<em>&gt; there in the first place, and if I happen to get stuck there, actually try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to seek help.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And finally. I am a swede. I have had a sheltered childhood and I
</em><br>
sincerely
<br>
<em>&gt; believe that the police exists for a proper cause and are able to help me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out given the need.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I may be a naïve idiot. I may be wrong. But so far, I live in a calm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society, where this approach works wonderfully, and given my frame of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reference, I really don't see the need to arm myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that my reasoning about overconfidence and tendency to happen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dip in mental stability is general enough for me to assess other people
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt; as well -- which is the reason why I'm not in favour of the second
</em><br>
amendment
<br>
<em>&gt; as such, and why I'm more inclined to yell about 'gun-toting madmen' than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'gun-grabbing socialists'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you feel that this answer is 'safe' enough to spread on, be my guest. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally try to avoid starting a flame war on extropians (although I
</em><br>
seem
<br>
<em>&gt; to be bloody close to it already :-) and _will_ not take a fullfledged gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debate, since I know that it will do more harm than good, since I know
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; you all have good arguments, and since I know that the main reason why I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a card-carrying NRA member myself is that I have a totally alien frame
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of reference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do feel free to forward this post.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; My apologies to Mike Lorry, I misread a post an accidentally quoted
</em><br>
him
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; saying

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm very much against arming civilians. I sincerely believe that it

will
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; lead to more violence and criminality, not less. And I do not see how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; automatically makes my otherwise rather liberal (European measurement,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This was not from him but from Mikael Johansson.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Once again sorry and Ill try to proof the names on this a little

better.
