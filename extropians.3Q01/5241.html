<em>&gt;&gt; Kuhn's theory was that all scientific theories are equally and

</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; Have you read it, or are you repeating what other people have said?  I'm
</em><br>

<em>&gt; you read the book differently than I did, or whether someone else did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's easy to believe that a deconstructionist might have read it that way,
</em><br>

it.
<br>
<p>It's funny this would come up on the list.  I'm now reading Paul Thagard's
<br>
_How Scientists Explain Disease_.  (In 1996, reviewed Thagard's _Conceptual
<br>
Revolutions_ in _Full Context_.  My review is now online at
<br>
<a href="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Concept.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Concept.html</a> .)  This book covers the
<br>
shift in the field of gastroenterology from believing most ulcers are caused
<br>
only by excessive stomach acid to the now widely accepted that view that
<br>
most are caused by Helicobacter pylori infections.
<br>
<p>I think Kuhn often in his _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_
<br>
straddles the fence.  Some have taken him to be a sort of radical
<br>
subjectivist.  One thing he did say which lends credence to this
<br>
interpretation of him -- and to the evolution of sociology of knowledge in
<br>
that direction -- is his view that different theories -- the paradigmatic
<br>
ones and not the garden variety ones:) -- are in some ways inconmensurable.
<br>
(It's been a long time since I've read the book, but the discussion in the
<br>
opening of chapter 12 is a good place to see this.)
<br>
<p>I find Thagard's Theory of Explanatory Coherence to be an improvement on
<br>
Kuhn, especially since he shows how and why paradigmatic theories (e.g.,
<br>
modern geology's acceptance of plate tectonics) in a detailed manner.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
