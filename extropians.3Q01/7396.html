<em>&gt; The President is certainly free to cite God, just as the murderers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 9/11 almost certainly did. I think the discussion here is whether such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citations are proper for a leader in his position as the President of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, and more generally whether the nonreligious should in any way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissemble their lack of faith. Had the President spoken specifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the perspective of a Methodist or whatever brand of Xian he is, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even just as a Xian, with the assumption that everyone else saw things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that same way, he would have been criticized as intolerant and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exclusionary. However when atheists are not taken into account nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to give a damn. This snubbing certainly indicates that atheists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are less worthy, which is exactly how many persons feel. The President
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could lapse into any sort of bigoted speech, it's his right, but I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cotton to him or anybody else promoting prejudice, no matter what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstance.
</em><br>
<p>In further support of your excellent comments, I'd add that non-theist
<br>
scientists have no obligation to participate in, or to in any way support holy
<br>
wars. Let the homicidal religious fanatics of the world kill each other to
<br>
fulfill the Armageddon prophecies that are part of their program. When it's
<br>
over, meek scientists can inherit the Earth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I hardly view anything to do with religion and our society's virtually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universal approval of this form of voluntary dementia as a side issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after 9/11. We now find ourselves embroiled in what is, at its essence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a religious war, whether or not we choose to acknowledge it as such.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Henceforth when one catalogs the horrors of religion down through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ages, that date can be added to the list as a stark reminder that we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far from out of this age of darkness yet. In addition to inspiring those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grim events, religious thinking deeply influences much of our nation's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policies, for the worse, from what I can tell. In the last couple of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weeks I have found myself becoming a lot less tolerant of other people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupidity, lack of intellectual integrity, or whatever you want to call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the particular set of superstitions we term &quot;religion.&quot; It cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defended as just a benign psychological aberration. It kills.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's exactly right: religion kills, and science heals (and note that
<br>
religion often kills by using tools supplied by science). As Richard Dawkins
<br>
has pointed out, one of the essential differences between science and religion
<br>
is that scientists don't settle their differences by killing each other. We
<br>
won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
