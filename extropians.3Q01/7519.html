<em>&gt; &gt; You are talking about one infected person could cause a wildfire affect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; across a nation and the globe. This viscous disease will kill within a week.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The USA for example only has a total of 7 million vaccines available.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once the outbreak became known we would likely have a tremendous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunkering down by people not traveling anywhere near locations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where there are known outbreaks.  The damage to economies might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be much worse than the damage from the smallpox itself.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, unless of course you are flying, say, a crop duster and spraying a
<br>
very light mix for a long distance over a large area. Flying from
<br>
Virginia to Connecticutt on a course 50 miles inland at 10,000 feet
<br>
would infect millions in the first round over a wide area.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is also true that one could probably scale up a crash vaccination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production program if required.  You could synthesize the required
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DNA vectors around the world and do bulk fermentation growth in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wine or beer manufacturing equipment.  You might not get the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vaccine out of it but something is better than nothing.
</em><br>
<p>Current claims are that starting now, we could get sufficient vaccine
<br>
doses available for the entire country by 2004 (according to CNN last
<br>
night).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; SMALLPOX escaped the controlled laboratories with the end of the Russian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; communist regime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Credible evidence?
</em><br>
<p>No refs, but news sources say that that is how Iraq got its own samples.
<br>
It is now apparently researching techniques for making it more potent
<br>
with a relative, the camelpox virus, which it hopes to apply to smallpox
<br>
once it figures out some good techniques (if it hasn't already).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The required resources, technology, and human endeavor are at our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; collective fingertips.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True, neutralizing antibodies produced in bulk would be much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective than vaccines at stopping the spread of viral diseases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A very clever technique *has* been published that demonstrates it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible to use a mutated anthrax toxin to neutralize the normal anthrax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toxin by disrupting the channel in forms.  One would need bulk production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this, though one could imagine the conversion of insulin production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facilities in a crisis situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't mind being urged to action, the claims need to be backed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; credible evidence though.  For example I've seen claims that bin Laden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obtained soviet nuclear missle warheads from the Chechnyans, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question becomes *where* did the Chechnyans get them.
</em><br>
<p>Captured/stolen from Russians of course. Russia doesn't design the same
<br>
sort of controls into tactical warheads as it does for its ICBM
<br>
warheads. They are apparently uncoded arming systems. Russia has
<br>
compiled evidence that several hundred weapons have dissapeared over the
<br>
years. With the abyzmal level of pay for its military personnel, it is
<br>
no wonder that this might occur.
