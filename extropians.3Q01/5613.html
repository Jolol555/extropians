<p>You're right about it being meaningless, but you're already thinking in
<br>
terms of the next fifty years being qualitatively different from the last
<br>
fifty years. Most people are still thinking in terms of 1951, and this
<br>
is particularly true of politicians who are conservative by disposition.
<br>
<p>As for skin colour being variable in the future, look at Michael Jackson.
<br>
It's _already_ changeable. But there are psychological issues associated
<br>
with changing your skin colour which I think will militate against
<br>
changing your skin colour in certain directions. I would certainly
<br>
understand many black people _not_ wanting to lighten their skin, viewing
<br>
doing so as a tacit admission that racism is irremediable and the only
<br>
way to get ahead is to deny your own identity.
<br>
<p>(Mind you, sufficient mutability of the pheontype may bring other
<br>
interesting effects. I can see a certain appeal in the idea of sentencing
<br>
rapists to a sex change, and unregenerate racists to become that which
<br>
they despise.)
