Subject: ASTRO: Astronomy article relating to Dark Matter
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>     &gt;to map the cosmic microwave background  radiation anisotropy.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; (One reason for you libertarians to pay your taxes is that
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; it takes money from a lot of people who have no real interest
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; in science and transfers it to scientists and engineers who
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; are trying to answer fundamental questions about how the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; universe really works.  If we didn't have the system setup
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; the way it is we would know a heck of a lot less about how
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; the universe works.
</em><br>
<p>Funny  you mention the cosmic microwave background radiation,
<br>
it was discovered by a company, the most actively traded on the
<br>
New York Stock Exchange, ATT. The instrument used contained
<br>
transistors, also invented by that company. When government says it
<br>
spends money on science they usually mean useless crap like the
<br>
space shuttle and the international space station. When people voluntarily
<br>
give their own money they tend to be smarter. Most of the world's
<br>
great telescopes were built with private funds donated by rich men,
<br>
including the largest of all, the 394 inch Keck on Mauna Kea,
<br>
a second private instrument of equal size recently became operational just
<br>
a few  hundred feet away. I think it's interesting that one of the biggest
<br>
contributors to Big Science, Charles Yerkes, made much of his money by
<br>
building street car lines, until government put him out of business when
<br>
they decided they could  run them much, much better. None of the men who
<br>
gave money for these things expected their telescope to make a profit.
<br>
If government wasn't around to steal a large pat of their money people like
<br>
this would give even more.
