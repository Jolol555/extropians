<p>&quot;I find that really hard to believe.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is difficult to believe, but with the growin trend of paternalism and no
<br>
negative feedback in schools, it would not surprise me.
<br>
<p>&quot;It seems to be fashionable to heap shit on public schools these days.&quot;
<br>
<p>Actually in the US it is quite unfashionable to talk bad of public schools.
<br>
There have been many examples where charter schools that were run by
<br>
corporations came in and took over ailing public schools, turned them
<br>
around, and then the parents voted to kick the corporations out because they
<br>
were philosophically opposed to people 'profiting off of education'
<br>
Unfortunately it is usually the kids who lose out, as these schools
<br>
objectively score better on every test given to thier students.  These
<br>
liberal biased soccermoms would rather have thier children have NO pencils
<br>
and pads then have some with Coca Cola logos on them.  Its a shame.
<br>
<p>&quot;Don't they remember why public 
<br>
school exists? There is this waving of arms and saying &quot;Leave it to the 
<br>
magic of the free market -- that will fix it.&quot; But all it will fix is that 
<br>
the rich will have less tax to pay and the poor will go without 
<br>
education... &quot;
<br>
<p>Do you actually think that is what happens?  In fact free markets limit the
<br>
wealth someone, such as a CEO could accumulate, mainly because if a company
<br>
pays too much out to a CEO they are necessarily charging more for thier
<br>
product and will be undersold by a competeing company that pays thier CEO
<br>
less.  If they pay thier CEO too little, he has no incentive to make sure
<br>
the company excells. In this way the market stabalizes on a value that a
<br>
company places on a good leader.  They cant pay them too much, and they cant
<br>
pay them too little.  
<br>
<p>Also, the top 5% of wage earners in the United States pay 30% of the entire
<br>
nations taxes.  So how do you figure that the rich have less tax to pay?
<br>
Bill Gates net worth is equal to half of the entire middle class in the US.
<br>
Yeah, he's rich, but that means he pays as much taxes as half of the entire
<br>
middle class.  
<br>
<p>Your objections to free markets are more based on your philosophical
<br>
opposition to it the to factual objections.  In the US and in many other
<br>
countries there is a strong liberal bias in the media (I am not a republican
<br>
either, and disagree with them just as much as with liberals, only on
<br>
different issues) But the bias is there and it is quite obvious.  All the
<br>
evidence and every case observed suggests that free markets (and capitalism
<br>
in general) benefits everybody involved.  You often hear in the media and by
<br>
people on the street the phrase &quot;The rich are getting rich and the poor are
<br>
getting poorer&quot; this is not the case.  The Rich are getting richer, but the
<br>
poor are as well.  Just look at the poverty level in the US right now and
<br>
compare it with the poverty level in the 1950's, and then in the early
<br>
1900's, then to the poor farmers that made up 85% of the population in 1850.
<br>
Everyone lives longer healthier lives.  The rich are getting richer, but so
<br>
are the poor.  Its just the rich may get richer faster, but the entire
<br>
global standard of living is increasing and this is directly because of
<br>
capitalistic competition.  We have a heavily regulated capitalism in the US,
<br>
and sparsely regulated free market economy would drastically accerlate that
<br>
process and drag 3rd world countries out of poverty and into
<br>
industrialization, and then further into post industrialization.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;I am no fan of school (I was lucky enough to be born into a family where I 
<br>
was well-off and basically taught myself), but that doesn't mean I am blind 
<br>
to how it can bring opportunity to those who would otherwise miss out. &quot;
<br>
<p>If there are people out there who want to be educated, there will be
<br>
companies out there willing to educate them, poor or not.  And they could do
<br>
it better, cheaper, and faster.
