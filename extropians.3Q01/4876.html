<em>&gt; Ideally, people like me, who are attracted to Mackie's position should try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to revise our language so that we no longer seem to make objective moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims, but only give hypothetical recommendations, etc. However, this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damn hard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I do find that I can get by from day to day making very few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *moral* judgments, as opposed to having personal responses, tastes, etc.
</em><br>
<p>I wonder what you might say about, e.g.,
<br>
1. The 20-60 million Soviet citizens that Stalin had eliminated in the
<br>
Gulag. I know you want to resist saying that what he did was morally wrong,
<br>
so what do you say? What Stalin did was, what? Gauche?
<br>
2.  Do you see any _significant_ difference between treating people as means
<br>
and ends? Obviously there is no moral difference as far as your concerned.
<br>
Is this a distinction without a difference for you?
<br>
3.  Why do you think that you and your ilk should revise our language to
<br>
attempt to expunge moral claims? I would have thought that you would prefer
<br>
to use moral language to attempt to manipulate others--to get them to
<br>
acquiesce to your preferences--given that so many others believe in the
<br>
&quot;myth&quot; of moral claims.  Wouldn't it be more _effective_ for you to pretend
<br>
that it is immoral for others to interfere with your liberty to pursue your
<br>
own version of the good, even though you are privy to the truth that moral
<br>
discourse is a sham? Why not keep the moral language and use it as a mask to
<br>
hide your will to power?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moi? I am a skeptic--at least I think I am. Error theorists like Mackie,
<br>
seem to me, presuppose way too much knowledge of Being. I am inclined to
<br>
think that there may be more things in heaven and earth than our dreamed of
<br>
in our human, all too human, philosophy. If one is a skeptic like me then it
<br>
is appropriate to reason as follows: If there are moral facts or properties,
<br>
and we reason and act if there are such, then we will be better off. If
<br>
there are no moral facts or properties, and we reason and act if there are
<br>
such, then we will be better off. Why? Because to think there might be moral
<br>
truths is comforting, and it will tend to make everyone behave better. (As
<br>
the old saw goes: if morals do not exist, then everything is permitted).
<br>
(Note: my argument is NOT that we would be better off to believe in morals
<br>
even if we _know_ there are not). Cheers, Mark.
