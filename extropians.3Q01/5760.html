I've actually thought along these lines before. As much as I hate government
<br>
spending and if they are intent on doing it, they should at least organize
<br>
it so that they address the most serious issues first. I.E. Take your total
<br>
&quot;do-gooder&quot; budget and break it down like this. What's the number 1 cause of
<br>
death, apply the most money to that. #2 gets the 2nd highest allotment of
<br>
cash. etc.... I'm sure there's a ton of politics involved, but there should
<br>
be some cost benefit analysis done on these things I would hope. Maybe this
<br>
is where a good program could be built to assess the relative worth on
<br>
certain projects.
<br>
<p>P.S. I would think that aging and aging illnesses would get the most
<br>
attention at this point. Nice transumanist line of thought in here I think.
<br>
:)

<em>&gt; &gt; Lets assume for the sake of argument your optimistic

<em>&gt; estimate is correct, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would mean there is one chance in 200,000 of it causing 10

<em>&gt; trillion dollars of damage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; next year, so on that basis alone we would be justified in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spending 50 million every year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; investigating it. Look at it another way, there is one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance in 200,000 of it killing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 200 million people next year. Thus your chances of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing killing you next year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are better than your chances of dying in a airline crash 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if you're a frequent flyer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Airline crashes don't kill anywhere near a thousand people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a year yet we spend far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more than 50 million a year trying to prevent them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I'M above 600 ft altitude and over 100 miles inland. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about YOU, but I expect to get through it just fine. People in glass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; houses shouldn't ask others to pay for their window washing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, there has to be something signficantly wrong with using straight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistics to analyse atypical events. I mean, people win the lottery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the time, and those odds are far higher than those posited here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the problem is that the odds of catastrophic events like this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are predicting off of insufficient information. Some years 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the odds will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be higher than others, simply because events like this are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely random, they are systemic, so saying the odds this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year are 1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in 200,000 and every year for the next million will be the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reflect actual risk, but merely an ignorance of sufficient information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for accurate predictions.
