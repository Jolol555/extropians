There are certainly senses in which that's true.  But there are also 
<br>
senses in which that's ... beside the point.  If people can use viral 
<br>
surgery to change their skin color (etc.) instead of cosmetics...then 
<br>
the old basis of race disappears.  If genetic characteristics remain 
<br>
fixed from the time of conception (or at least from birth) then I guess 
<br>
that it continues relevant.  Or at least as relevant as tatoos, scars, 
<br>
and other hard to change features. And cosmetic surgery can also be 
<br>
expected to improve... or at least become more extensive in what it can 
<br>
handle.  Just consider the possibilities inherent in self-cloned skin 
<br>
grafts (i.e., skin grafts of pieces of skin whose DNA matches your own).
<br>
<p>To assert an intrinsic covariance between features is to make an 
<br>
assertion that could generally do with a good deal of proof.  You don't 
<br>
very often see assertions that all people with lime-green mohawks are 
<br>
stupid.  (Perhaps that they look stupid, but that's a different matter.) 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that is acknowledged to be a rapidly changable feature.  A 
<br>
reasonable extrapolation would seem to project that the percentage of 
<br>
features available that were fixed would decline in the future.
<br>
<p>Now it has been asserted that all white haired persian cats with blue 
<br>
eyes are deaf.  Supposedly there is one small area of the chromosome (or 
<br>
perhaps even one gene) that has two effects simultaneously.  And all 
<br>
currently known calico cats are female (each color comes from a separate 
<br>
X chromosome, and the white color is separately determined).  So there 
<br>
are genetic covariances that are difficult to disentangle.  But such 
<br>
cases are quite rare, and the assertion of one is something that needs 
<br>
considerable justification.
<br>
<p>OTOH, human plasticity under social conditioning is well established. 
<br>
There have been some interesting twin studies on this.  People seem to 
<br>
define themselves in their environment so as to be relatively distinct 
<br>
from others in their environment (but not too distinct).  This is far 
<br>
from being quantitativly exact... but given the difficulties in such 
<br>
studies, even when discussing the social behavior of rats (which we can 
<br>
pretty much manipulate as we choose), quantitative exactitude is too 
<br>
much to hope for.
<br>
<p>So it seems to me that as more features are subject to voluntary choice, 
<br>
the concept of race will decline in importance, becoming more similar to 
<br>
other voluntary social groupings.  (I.e., it is implicitly acknowledged 
<br>
that if you press people hard enough, they will slide from one group to 
<br>
another.)  I'm not totally convinced that this is good.  There may come 
<br>
to be a strong pressure for everyone to slide into the same mold.  But 
<br>
it's certainly a different problem than what current racism is.
