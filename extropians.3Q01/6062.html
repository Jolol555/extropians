</em><br>
<p>I believe in non-initation of force and that coercion is an
<br>
unethical (and inefficient) manner of spreading one's memes, but
<br>
that doesn't mean I will not prepare for dangerous eventualities,
<br>
act when attacked or find better ways of spreading my memes. 
<br>
<p>&quot;A stone is not an argument&quot; - if you start accepting stones as
<br>
arguments the discourse will end up with burning skyscrapers. On the
<br>
other hand, it is a good idea to learn how to dodge stones, where
<br>
shields can be found, how to throw back the stones and how to behave
<br>
so that many of the supporters of the stone-throwers will see that
<br>
groups of people progressing through rational arguments will achieve
<br>
far more and better results than the stone-throwers. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Assuming adroit side-stepping of such blockage,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; largely from little more than some errors in their thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based in limited understanding, training, biology and so on? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will you sit and let them kill each other utterly?  Or might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you, given the power, back all of them up continuously with DNA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; samples so that they can have another go until they grow up a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit?  Or perhaps slap them in a Matrix like arrangement designed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for their eventual (at their own pace - no force) evolution into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more enlightened beings?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Honestly, what would you consider the most moral and ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course and why?
</em><br>
<p>I think people have a right to their own views, how stupid and
<br>
malicious they may be. They also have the right to their own lives,
<br>
and that means they do not have the right to use force to kill
<br>
others. Hence it would, from my point of view, be right to
<br>
intercede in conflicts and try to put an end to them. Actually
<br>
killing people is a last resort action, and only ethically allowable
<br>
in self-defense. 
<br>
<p>Backing up people from DNA samples isn't enough - what use is a lot
<br>
of clones? If I could, I think archiving mindstates continously
<br>
would be a good thing, but it is not obvious at all when to
<br>
&quot;resurrect&quot; individuals and from what point in their mindstate. It
<br>
also has the same problem as the Matrix idea: what about their own
<br>
personal integrity? I don't believe that I have the right to anybody
<br>
else's mental state, and definitely no right to play around with
<br>
them (other than through the standard channels of communications). 
<br>
<p>If I was a posthuman superintelligence, I would do what I could to
<br>
encourage constructive behavior among other people. That might
<br>
include offering rewards for rational behavior and disincentives for
<br>
irrational behavior. But I don't think I would be morally entitled
<br>
to use force or directly hack them even if I was Omega itself.
