So, because of Osama Bin Laden's terror attacks, we should knuckle under, cower behind our borders in fear, and tremblingly allow the Muslims to complete the commission of a genocide that we spent many lives in WW II, opposing Hitler's Nazis, to truncate and avenge?  I think not, and further question whether or not the person who suggests same possesses ideological affinities with the ideological progeny of those who in WW II tried, almost successfully, to commit such genocide.
<br>
Let us not forget that Osama Bin Laden's closest friend and constant traveling companion is the person who assassinated Egyptian president and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Anwar Sadat for making peace with Israel, years ago, on September the 11th, and that we supply more annual aid to Egypt than any other country besides Israel.  To put 
<br>
it bluntly, the message being given to us is that we were targeted at least partially for being a peacemaker, and removing an Islamic country from the list of countries who consider themselves enemies of Israel.  In this case, I believe that, considering the blatantly bloodthirsty brutality of the message, that we should kill this messenger, who eminently deserves same, rather than kowtow to him and do his bidding.

<em>&gt;Subject: OWL: Never Again
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Jason Walker is mistaken. I do not think that the United States should give
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one inch to terrorism WHEN OUR INTERESTS AND PRINCIPLES ARE AT STAKE. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;America has no interest in being allied with Israel. Nor do we have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;significant commonality of values. Israel is more like the hated Muslim
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries than like the United States. Morally speaking, the Jews in Israel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are no better than their neighbors. Do the Arabs torture and assassinate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their enemies? So do the Israelis. Are the Arab states run by terrorists and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mass murderers? So is Israel. (Shamir was a terrorist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Begin a terrorist, Barak a trained assassin, and Sharon is a butcher.) Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Arab states sponsor terrorism? So does Israel. Are Arab countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anti-capitalist? So is Israel. Are Arabs tribal and collectivist? So are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Jews. Do Muslim states base their laws on revealed religion? Some of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do. But so does Israel. Do most Jews and Arabs actively take part in these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;policies? No. Do most of them give their tacit consent? Absolutely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is NO REASON to take sides in this conflict. And if the WTC bombing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wakes America up to this fact, then so be it. I'd prefer that we wake up now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than after a nuclear or biological or biochemical attack. As strange as this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may seem, the WTC attack was designed to get attention, not to inflict
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maximum casualties. Much of the population of NYC could have been killed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with anthrax. But that would not be as telegenic as the WTC collapse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is not an act of cowardice to admit that one has been wrong. Indeed, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;takes far more courage to admit one's error than it does to persist in it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and compound it with calls for the nuclear annihilation of the Muslim world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How do we make sure that it NEVER AGAIN occurs? Here's one answer:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;So we tell the Americans as people, and we tell the mothers of soldiers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;American mothers in general that if they value their lives and the lives of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their children, to find a nationalistic government that will look after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their interests and not the interests of the Jews.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;The continuation of tyranny will bring the fight to America, as Ramzi
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yousef
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and others did. This is my message to the American people: to look for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;serious government that looks out for their interests and does not attack
</em><br>
<em>&gt;others, their lands, or their honor. And my word to American
</em><br>
<em>&gt;journalists is not to ask why we did that but ask what their government has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;done that forced us to defend ourselves.&quot;--- Osama bin Laden, May 1998
