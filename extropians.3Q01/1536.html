<em>&gt; If we do not defeat nukes, they will eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defeat us.  All our pleasant dreams of nanotech, AI, cryonics, etc,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be nuked back into the stone age, unless we defeat the nukes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first. MAD wont keep us safe forever, we need to press on.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Of course, nothing will keep us safe forever. The MAD policy at least serves
<br>
as a reminder that war (politics carried on by other means) no longer makes
<br>
sense for sentient beings who have discovered the scientific method. As I. J.
<br>
Good put it, &quot;the first ultra intelligent machine is the last invention that
<br>
man need ever make.&quot; So, forget about defeating nukes and get busy with that
<br>
first UIM. Meanwhile, MAD will serve us well.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
