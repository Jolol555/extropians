</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike -

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This allegation that illiteracy has increased among African Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; following Brown vs Board of Education is, as well as surprising, also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; quite inaccurate. According to Arthur Hu's statistics site
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; (<a href="http://www.leconsulting.com/arthurhu/index/literacy.htm">http://www.leconsulting.com/arthurhu/index/literacy.htm</a>), which I hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; you find a sufficiently conservative source, illiteracy among blacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; over age 14 declined from 11% to 3.6% from 1947 to 1969.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And what has occured since then, Pat? Since 1969, black illiteracy has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; skyrocketed. I'm not surprised, though, this is rather typical 'cherry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; picking' statistical practice. Integration wasn't even beginning to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spread widely until 1969, so using pre-1969 statistics to claim that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; black illiteracy has not gone up since BvBOE is a fraudulent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; presentation of facts. The facts you present, of pre-1969 data, show

<em>&gt; &gt; that segregated educational systems were having a positive impact upon

<em>&gt; &gt; literacy among african-americans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Black illiteracy has &quot;skyrocketed&quot; since 1969? You accuse me of &quot;cherry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picking&quot; statistics, when you have presented no supporting evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatsoever. This isn't a debate between liberal and conservative. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually between facts and fantasy. Once again I ask you, upon what are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you basing these assertions? If you had perused my other link you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have seen additional statistics regarding the decline in illiteracy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; among African Americans during the 20th century. It is just the opposite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what you claim. If you get a chance between posts, take a gander at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/naal/historicaldata/illiteracy.asp">http://nces.ed.gov/naal/historicaldata/illiteracy.asp</a>. There you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find that from 1969 to 1979, when you say integration was beginning to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spread widely and that illiteracy was consequently &quot;skyrocketing,&quot; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate of illiteracy among blacks over age 14 fell by more than 50%. While
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illiteracy among African Americans remains relatively high, it has never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; returned to the levels experienced before school desegregation was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mandated.
</em><br>
<p>Frankly I find it ludicrous to even claim that only 1.9% of blacks are
<br>
illiterate (or even just 1% of whites). Then I look in the fine print
<br>
and see that they are no longer sticking to objective standards of
<br>
literacy, but subjective opinions of 'functional literacy' which accepts
<br>
ebonics, misspellings, and other lack of grammatical rigor as
<br>
'functionally literate', and which sees nothing wrong with high school
<br>
graduates who can't do a simple algebra equation. The standards of
<br>
'functional literacy' ignore phonics, and require only that the
<br>
individual be able to read and spell a thousand or so words in generally
<br>
recognisable form and do simple arithmatic functions.
<br>
<p>When over half of the students in a state fail the minimum standard of a
<br>
state standardized test, yet proponents of 'functional literacy' say
<br>
that 99% of Americans are literate, it is rather obvious that the
<br>
standards being used are completely unacceptable. When our kids'
<br>
teachers themselves are such poor spellers that their kids can't help
<br>
but fail to learn proper spelling,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not saying that integration caused an increase in literacy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, your theory that racial integration resulted in an increase in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illiteracy among blacks is clearly contradicted by the evidence. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can prove otherwise, please present your data.

<br>
<p>Discusses race and literacy in general, and the following is from the
<br>
FAQ of the National Institute For Literacy's website (
<br>
<a href="http://novel.nifl.gov/nifl/faqs.html#measure">http://novel.nifl.gov/nifl/faqs.html#measure</a> ):
<br>
<p>&quot;How literate is the adult population?
<br>
<p>Very few adults in the US are truly illiterate. Rather, there are many
<br>
adults with low literacy skills who lack the foundation they need to
<br>
find and keep decent jobs, support their children's education and
<br>
participate actively in civic life. Between 21 and 23 percent of the
<br>
adult population or approximately 44 million people, according to the
<br>
National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS), scored in Level 1 (Almost all
<br>
adults in Level 1 can read a little but not well enough to fill out an
<br>
application, read a food label, or read a simple story to a child.
<br>
Adults in Level 2 usually can perform more complex tasks such as
<br>
comparing, contrasting, or integrating pieces of information but usually
<br>
not higher level reading and problem-solving skills. Adults in levels 3
<br>
through 5 usually can perform the same types of more complex tasks on
<br>
increasingly lengthy and dense texts and documents. ). Another 25-28
<br>
percent of the adult population, or between 45 and 50 million people,
<br>
scored in Level 2. Literacy experts believe that adults with skills at
<br>
Levels 1 and 2 lack a sufficient foundation of basic skills to function
<br>
successfully in our society. 
<br>
<p>Many factors help to explain the relatively large number of adults in
<br>
Level 1. Twenty-five percent of adults in Level 1 were immigrants who
<br>
may have just been learning to speak English. More than 60 percent
<br>
didn't complete high school. More than 30 percent were over 65. More
<br>
than twenty-five percent had physical or mental conditions that kept
<br>
them from fully participating in work, school, housework, or other
<br>
activities, and almost twenty percent had vision problems that affected
<br>
their ability to read print. &quot;
<br>
<p>So by the NIFL's opinion, 21-23 percent of the adult population of the
<br>
US are functionally illiterate (as of 1992), which totally blows out of
<br>
the water your claims of only a few percent. The NIFL seems to be making
<br>
a specific effort at ignoring racial, gender, and other differences in
<br>
literacy and refuse to look at such in their national literacy
<br>
assessment.
<br>
<p>It would be wrong of me to blatantly blame all of this on blacks,
<br>
especially since they make up less than 13% of the population, however I
<br>
think that this demonstrates that at the very least, illiteracy among
<br>
all races in the US has gone up markedly since the years you provided
<br>
stats (1979), which proves my point. By 1979, integration was well
<br>
established and big cities generally had forced bussing in place by this
<br>
time. By 1992, when the above stats were collected, both integration and
<br>
forced bussing (as well as other social factors like the end of corporal
<br>
punishment in schools and the elimination of merit based grade
<br>
promotion) had done their damage.
