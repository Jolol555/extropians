<em>&gt; What would we do differently if blacks and whites committed the same exact
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>As I've said before, the impact of transhumanism and its attendant
<br>
technologies on the human race is that there is going to be MORE
<br>
diversity genetically among people, not less, which illustrates how
<br>
content-less the anti-cloning and anti-genetics accusations of
<br>
'eugenics' are. As the race gets more diverse, you will have more people
<br>
looking at a larger part of the human race as 'inhuman' (as I described
<br>
in my original posts on the Vinge singularity discussion several years
<br>
ago that is now on the Extropy website) if they are less experienced
<br>
with those variants. Since knowledge breeds empathy and diffuses racism,
<br>
xenophobia, and discrimination, we need to be aware of what the reality
<br>
is today, and what the misconceptions are, in these subjects if we are
<br>
to be effective in the future in preparing the human race to deal with
<br>
transhumanity without annihilating itself in conflict between races,
<br>
technologies, etc...
<br>
<p>We need to be able to objectively and dispassionately say, &quot;okay, this
<br>
is what real race differences are and are not, and this is how we can,
<br>
as ethical and rational transhumans, deal with these real facts as well
<br>
as peoples misperceptions to make this a better world.&quot;
