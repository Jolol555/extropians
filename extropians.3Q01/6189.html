</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure if he promotes that.  I hope he was merely joking.
<br>
<p>I'm sure many leftist, rightists, moderates, libertarians, apoliticals, and
<br>
the like died in the WTC yesterday.  They were _all_ human.  Ideology should
<br>
not be a basis for hatred.  I don't hate those I disagree with, though I do
<br>
believe they are often wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whoever perpetrated these awful acts didn't see buildings full of
</em><br>
atheists,
<br>
<em>&gt; christians, muslims, hindus, red, black, white, yellow people of all
</em><br>

symbol
<br>

</em><br>
<p>All too true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We live in an information age. We should make best use of that and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undermine hate. I don't believe you will ever exterminate terrorism until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racism, nationalism, and religion have the light of good sense illuminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their darkest recesses of ignorance.
</em><br>
<p>Probably so, though I think the hardcore terrorists are probably beyond
<br>
reach.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Bombs and guns don't stop hatred; they ferment it.
</em><br>
<p>It depends.  They have their use, but they are mostly used unwisely by
<br>
governments, who too often use them to oppress and butcher -- even if their
<br>
members don't initially intend this.
<br>
<p>Later!
