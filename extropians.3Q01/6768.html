The July/August 2001 issue of _The Atlantic_ had an article which is
<br>
highly relevant to our current situation.  I'll post the first few paragraphs
<br>
below, and the entire text can be found at:

<p>The Counterterrorist Myth 
<br>
<p>A former CIA operative explains why the terrorist Usama bin Ladin has
<br>
little to fear from American intelligence 
<br>

..... 
<br>
<p>The United States has spent billions of dollars on counterterrorism since
<br>
the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya, in August of 1998. Tens
<br>
of millions have been spent on covert operations specifically targeting
<br>
Usama bin Ladin and his terrorist organization, al-Qa'ida. Senior U.S.
<br>
officials boldly claim—even after the suicide attack last October on
<br>
the USS Cole, in the port of Aden—that the Central Intelligence Agency
<br>
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are clandestinely &quot;picking apart&quot;
<br>
bin Ladin's organization &quot;limb by limb.&quot; But having worked for the CIA
<br>
for nearly nine years on Middle Eastern matters (I left the Directorate
<br>
of Operations because of frustration with the Agency's many problems),
<br>
I would argue that America's counterterrorism program in the Middle East
<br>
and its environs is a myth.
<br>
<p>Peshawar, the capital of Pakistan's Northwest Frontier, is on the cultural
<br>
periphery of the Middle East. It is just down the Grand Trunk Road from
<br>
the legendary Khyber Pass, the gateway to Afghanistan. Peshawar is where
<br>
bin Ladin cut his teeth in the Islamic jihad, when, in the mid-1980s,
<br>
he became the financier and logistics man for the Maktab al-Khidamat,
<br>
The Office of Services, an overt organization trying to recruit and aid
<br>
Muslim, chiefly Arab, volunteers for the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan.
<br>
The friendships and associations made in The Office of Services gave
<br>
birth to the clandestine al-Qa'ida, The Base, whose explicit aim is to
<br>
wage a jihad against the West, especially the United States.
<br>
<p>According to Afghan contacts and Pakistani officials, bin Ladin's men
<br>
regularly move through Peshawar and use it as a hub for phone, fax, and
<br>
modem communication with the outside world. Members of the embassy-bombing
<br>
teams in Africa probably planned to flee back to Pakistan. Once there
<br>
they would likely have made their way into bin Ladin's open arms through
<br>
al-Qa'ida's numerous friends in Peshawar. Every tribe and region of Afghanistan
<br>
is represented in this city, which is dominated by the Pathans, the pre-eminent
<br>
tribe in the Northwest Frontier and southern Afghanistan. Peshawar is
<br>
also a power base of the Taliban, Afghanistan's fundamentalist rulers.
<br>
Knowing the city's ins and outs would be indispensable to any U.S. effort
<br>
to capture or kill bin Ladin and his closest associates. Intelligence
<br>
collection on al-Qa'ida can't be of much real value unless the agent
<br>
network covers Peshawar.
