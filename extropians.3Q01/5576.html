<p>I was referring specifically to the UK experience. There was a lot of
<br>
immigration from the Carribean and India/Pakistan into the UK in
<br>
the 1950's and 1960's; subsequently, as overt racism was politically
<br>
unacceptable except on the barking fringes of the conservative party,
<br>
&quot;immigration&quot; became a kind of code-word for &quot;keeping the darkies out&quot;.
<br>
<p>Obviously, this doesn't work in the US, which has a large indigenous
<br>
black population. But I noticed some interesting resonances in this
<br>
piece. Given that white anglo-saxon types are due to become a minority
<br>
in the US by 2050 if current trends continue, I'm wondering if this
<br>
grumbling isn't a direct analogy to the British experience?
