<em>&gt; MAD will serve us well, until it fails.  We might have the UIM by then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but we might not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I have not seen is some kind of timeline that shows the intermediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steps that need to be accomplished before the UIM is born.
</em><br>
<p>But you've seen the intermediate steps that allow us to jettison MAD?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project has something like this, but Ive not seen one for AI.  Does such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a thing exist?  Are there milestones we should be looking for?  spike
</em><br>
<p>Maybe this will help, Spike:
<br>
<p>Sam N. Lehman Wilzeg, &quot;Frankenstein Unbound: Towards a Legal Definition of
<br>
Artifical Intelligence,&quot; Futures (December 1981), pp. 442-457
<br>
<p>By any definition the present powers of AI machines are both impressive and
<br>
worrisome.  Cyberneticists have already created or proven that AI constructs
<br>
can do the following:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(1)  &quot;Imitate the behavior of any other machine.&quot;
<br>
--J. von Neumann, The Computer and the Brain (New Haven: Yale University
<br>
Press, 1974)
<br>
<p>(2)  Exhibit curiosity (ie are always moving to investigate their
<br>
environment); display self-recognition (ie react to the sight of themselves);
<br>
and manifest mutual recognition of members of their own machine species.
<br>
--W.G. Walter, The Living Brain (New York: W.W. Norton and Co, 1953)
<br>
<p>(3)  Learn from their own mistakes.
<br>
--N. Wiener, God and Golem, Inc (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1966)
<br>
<p>(4)   Be as &quot;creative&quot; and &quot;purposive&quot; as are humans, even to the extent of
<br>
&quot;looking for purposes which they can fulfill.&quot;
<br>
--N. Wiener, The Human Use of Human Beings (Garden City, NY: Dobleday, 1954)
<br>
<p>(5)   Reproduce themselves, in five fundamentally different modes, of which
<br>
the fifth--the &quot;probabilistic mode of self-reproduction&quot;--closely parallels
<br>
biological evolution through mutations (which in the case of [machines] means
<br>
random changes of elements), so that &quot;highly efficient, complex, powerful
<br>
automata can evolve from inefficient, simple, weak automata.&quot;
<br>
-- J. von Neumann, Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata (Urbana: University of
<br>
Illinois Press, 1966)
<br>
<p>(6)   &quot;Can have an unbounded life span through self-repairing mechanisms.&quot;
<br>
--M. Arbib, Brains, Machines and Mathematics (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1964)
<br>
<p>In short, &quot;a generation of robots is rapidly evolving, a breed that can see,
<br>
read, talk, learn, and even feel [emotions].&quot;
<br>
--D. Rorvik, As Man Becomes Machine (New York: Pocket Books, 1971)
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
