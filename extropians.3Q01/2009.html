<p>&lt;&lt; Your guess is right, none of the rioters were Hindu, they were all Muslims
<br>
&nbsp;of Pakistani origin (Mirpuri in the main to be precise).  I'm not sure why
<br>
&nbsp;you think this helps explain it though. Generally speaking the Hindu
<br>
&nbsp;community here in Britain has not been involved in any of the recent
<br>
&nbsp;disturbances, and is highly successful economically. The youths involved in
<br>
&nbsp;the riots, whether Asian or White, are generally from very poor
<br>
&nbsp;neighbourhoods. One major cause of the tension is competition between ethnic
<br>
&nbsp;groups for government money - each group believes the other is getting too
<br>
&nbsp;much at its expense. Another is the manifold side-effects of the &quot;war on
<br>
&nbsp;drugs&quot;. I don't believe the (nominal) religion of the rioters has anything
<br>
&nbsp;much to do with it. The primary cultural influence on many of these young
<br>
&nbsp;men is the subculture of gangsta rap - they wish they could be Tupac Shakur
<br>
&nbsp;(but alive of course!:)) Steve Davies &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Thanks Steve.
