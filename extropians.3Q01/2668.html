</em><br>
<em>&gt;(by the way, thanks for your very interesting and informative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;posts, Carlos)
</em><br>
<p>My pleasure, it is one of the few things on which I can actually say something
<br>
worth posting... ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What are the prospects, as a first step, in lessening the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corruption?  Are there any positive trends here?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not aware of any specific statistics measuring the evolution of corruption
<br>
levels in Argentina. I recall (vaguely) some static measures of it, and there
<br>
were very bad (something like one of the 10 most corrupt countries in regards
<br>
to level of bribing needed to get things passed through the government office
<br>
or such?). As the things to corrput have grown much less, and also the
<br>
current administration is less dirty (though probably equally incompetent).
<br>
The judiciary is in general a bad thing to deal with, too. There are many
<br>
top judges with dirty connections to past and present administrations and
<br>
not-very-honest businessmen, and they are too eager to help their friends.
<br>
The security forces are another problem, as I mentioned in a previous post
<br>
many of them still have an organizational culture going back to the Process
<br>
dictatorship. There have been routine involvements of high police officers
<br>
and chiefs in drug dealing, &quot;selling protection&quot;, contract killing, and
<br>
even terrorist attacks. I can't see how any important positive trends are to
<br>
be expected in a long while regarding corruption. Sure, Menem and some of his
<br>
cronies are in jail or processed, but this is mostly an isolated case,
<br>
and I doubt it would have happened were it not for Menem being beyond
<br>
the cost-benefit barrier for the oligarchies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes, they must be somewhat fearful.  By the way, how hard is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for someone to start a new business in Argentina?  (In Germany,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is rather difficult.  In Russia, I think, almost impossible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't know about other countries, but would like to learn.)
</em><br>
<p>I'm really not sure about this. My guess, considering the very few
<br>
cases in which I've read about new businesses in Argentina (with foreing
<br>
investments) is that it could be difficult, particularly if you want to
<br>
play it clean. If you are competing for a contract that also attracts
<br>
other investors, you must expect investors to play dirty, and the government
<br>
officials too. Tax pressure will be quite high, unless again you are willing
<br>
to play dirty and get some &quot;special agreement&quot;. I think this whole mess is
<br>
much cleaner if one tries to enter the sectors not controlled by the
<br>
government. There have been quite successful entrances by a few big
<br>
supermarket firms, for instance. I'm not sure how one would fare when
<br>
trying to set up some industrial company. The problem for this last kind
<br>
of investment, as I already mentioned, will be probably the awful
<br>
infrastructure on which you would have to work. I can't remember any
<br>
exact figures, didn't the CEPAL reports I linked mentioned a drop in
<br>
investments and imports?
<br>
