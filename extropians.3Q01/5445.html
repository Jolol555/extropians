<em>&gt;From: &quot;Mitchell, Jerry (3337)&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:Jerry.Mitchell@esavio.com?Subject=Re:%20Paying%20for%20school&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108302009.NAA25996@well.com&gt;">Jerry.Mitchell@esavio.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;My point here is why doesnt everyone get the legislated minimum?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I make more then minimum wage and theres a reason. Supply and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;demand dictate this stuff, not government OR buisnesses OR unions.
</em><br>
<p>My point was that before Unions came along everybody DID make the
<br>
minimum, and it was a much smaller minimum.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This boils down to.. did the Unions distort the market. If they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;did, they created inefficiencies.
</em><br>
<p>What they did was create workers rights, which didn't exist before.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Worth $6 to whom? The company? Why are you worth more then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everyone else? My supposition was the normal wage for a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;job was $3. Why cant I come in and offer to do the same job as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;union guys at a lower price?
</em><br>
<p>For the record I'm always worth alot more than I'm paid.
<br>
<p>Because the Union guys have agreed to work only with other union
<br>
guys.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Like someone else said in their post, the unions can bitch and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whine all they want. End the end, Mexico will get the jobs and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those union saps will be out of work. Thell learn they cant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control market forces long without paying the piper.
</em><br>
<p>My job isn't going to Mexico Jerry, and never will.
<br>
<p>There are at least two completely different kinds of Unions which
<br>
is something most critics don't understand.
<br>
<p>There are the Industrial Unions which are the ones you've been
<br>
criticizing, and there are craft Unions (plumbers, carpenters,
<br>
electricians, iron workers etc) these Unions have been split in the
<br>
past over their differences and were only recently re-united
<br>
(AFL/CIO).
<br>
<p>Our work can only be done here which is one reason why we'll
<br>
remain. We also run our own schools with continuing education after
<br>
a 5 year apprenticeship. We continue to both evolve and pursue
<br>
excellence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So in a situation where a job is needed to prevent my kids from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going hungry, dont you think that attacking companies may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the best route to accomplish this? They MAKE the jobs.
</em><br>
<p>And we do the work Jerry. Fortunately many companies are more
<br>
enlightened these days and serious disputes less frequent. We try
<br>
and work together.
<br>
<p>At our last negotiation we sat down, opened our laptops, brought up
<br>
our spreadsheets, and said something like this, &quot; I thought we'd
<br>
begin by looking at the recent 2 billion dollar stock buy-back, the
<br>
6% increase in dividends, revenues, and management compensation for
<br>
the last three years.&quot;
<br>
<p>We settled amicably at 3 years at about 4.5% a year
<br>
<p>My company knows what it's labor and benefits costs for a large
<br>
share of it's workers is going to be for the next three years.
<br>
<p>Does yours?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I dont want to get into anti-trust law here, but I will say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is so subjective, there is no way a company can possible know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in advance of a trial, if what their doing will result in getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attacked for &quot;monopolistic .practices&quot;. I know its popular to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attack the successful guy, your right, the government and millions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Americans cant stand the rich and will attack then whenever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they can for any reason they can drum up. Class warfare at its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;best, but ultimately Microsoft doesnt control the OS market as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;long as theres alternatives. They just have a huge market share
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and thats the goal of ALL companies I know of.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have anything against the rich, I intend on being one, if
<br>
the market hadn't collapsed I'd already be a good deal closer to my
<br>
goal.
<br>
<p>There are a number of people including the government who say that
<br>
Microsoft engaged in practices that were illegal. I prefer to wait
<br>
till the courts finish with this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;My point here is to do the same thing youve been doing. You said
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we owe everything we have to the unions and thats simply not true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Youve said nothing positive at all about the corporations and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;appears that the unions can do no wrong. I simply expanded on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;approach to show the lameness of using it in a reasonable debate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Its a lot easier to imagine a world with no unions then it is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;picture one without companies.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't say we owe everything to the unions, I said unions were
<br>
the origin of workers rights which evolved into every salary and
<br>
benefits package around today.
<br>
<p>This is 101 stuff, every school textbook in America has stuff in it
<br>
about the Haymarket riot. I've said nothing positive about
<br>
corporations in particular in this post because we've been talking
<br>
about the origins of workers rights, something corporations have
<br>
opposed historically at every turn.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I will say one thing nice about the unions. If your in one, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can force a company to pay you over market value for your labor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For the consumers or the people needing jobs, sorry though, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out of luck.
</em><br>
<p>It's quite clear that you've been taught to hate unions, and this
<br>
kind of prejudice is always difficult to overcome.
