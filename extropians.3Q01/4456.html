I was schmoozing the other day with the Amazing Randi and Lord Robert
<br>
Winston, as one does (but not at the same time), and sought Lord Winston's
<br>
opinion on the likelihood of extending human longevity. He found it
<br>
implausible, on a number of familiar grounds. I mentioned in contradiction
<br>
that Professor Michael Rose held a more optimistic view, one perhaps
<br>
countenanced by his already having pulled off this trick with some
<br>
creatures admittedly less ambitious than humans. Ah yes, Lord W. told me,
<br>
with a significant look. Michael Rose has... an unusual standing among his
<br>
peers. (Or something along those lines; you never have a biro and a sleeve
<br>
when you need to jot down exact quotes, and anyway I was already juggling
<br>
my Cabernet Sauvignon and nibbles.)
<br>
<p>Ah well.
<br>
