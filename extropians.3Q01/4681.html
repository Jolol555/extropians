<p><em>&gt; About a year ago, I engaged in a short debate with a lecturer about whether 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; students understand the homework they do or not. This lecturer insisted that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since students can solve the homework problems, it means they understood the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; text.
</em><br>
<p>...
<br>
<em>&gt; Suddenly, I realised that this has a connection to a famous problem in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Artifical Intelligence, which we call the Chinese Room problem. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's a cute analogy! :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The paradox makes sense now. The students don't understand the true problem and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions behind the problem, but they know the rules of solving the problem 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how to apply them. Therefore, they operate like a Chinese Room translator 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who seems to understand Chinsese.
</em><br>
<p>I think that it's the difference between knowing how to do something,
<br>
and understanding to the point that you can articulate it.  I used to
<br>
ace all my math classes through differential equations and applied
<br>
analysis (my downfall came later when things got abstract).  However,
<br>
it wasn't until I was 26 that anyone forced me to explain that stuff.
<br>
At that point I was lucky enough to be tutoring a 35 year old man, 
<br>
who, not a deep thinker, was certainly a thorough and careful one.
<br>
He didn't let me get away with ANYTHING!  And by God when I got through
<br>
explaining differentials and vector calculus to him, I finally *really*
<br>
understood it (instead of merely being able to do all the problems).
<br>
<p>But how important is this more profound understanding?  The answer 
<br>
clearly is:  it depends on what you want to use your skills or your
<br>
knowledge for.  Some things I want to understand to the point of
<br>
being able to articulate them; other things I don't.  It depends on
<br>
one's own values, for one thing.
