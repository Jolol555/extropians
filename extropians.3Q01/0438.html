<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Too many people that do have better lives have more

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; bankruptcy and perhaps homelessness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In every case, this is due to a lack of education---specifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the memes of thrift, prudence, and determination.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BULLSHIT.  It is also due to a culture that has bought hook,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; line and sinker that mass-consumerism is the only thing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keeps us all from poverty and guarantees economic &quot;health&quot;.   
</em><br>
<p>When you say &quot;also&quot;, it sounds like you are agreeing; but
<br>
&quot;BULLSHIT&quot; makes it sound as if you aren't.  So what do
<br>
you think are the odds of someone having (admirably)
<br>
more savings than debt, and being a lot more than a few
<br>
paychecks from bankruptcy and homelessness provided that
<br>
they are thrifty, prudent and determined?  Surely you
<br>
agree with me that the probability is very high.
<br>
<p>I think that I understand what you are saying here: namely,
<br>
that our culture's embrace of mass-consumerism is also responsible
<br>
for people being in such frightful debt.  I agree.  But you make
<br>
it sound as though people had bought into a philosophy.  No, they
<br>
have not.  They are simply doing what their pleistocene genes are
<br>
commanding:  get as much stuff as you can.  There are very few
<br>
memes and systems of belief that say &quot;Go forth and buy, Thou
<br>
shalt consume and consume&quot;.  But everyone hears Benjamin Franklin's
<br>
maxims and lots of other advice, e.g., from the pulpit.  People 
<br>
know about this good advice, and know that it would be best for
<br>
them to follow; it's just that they find obeying those wise
<br>
prescriptions to be difficult.  It sounds like you want to
<br>
blame wall street, or someone.

<em>&gt; Have you worked in software?  I've seen the pace accelerate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and re-accelerate not out of any joy in creation or creative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zeal but out of fear of falling behind, of not delivering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something/anything before the competitors did, of scrabbling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for something anything to sell rather than often making any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real dent in the real needs of the industry.  Every year I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have watched it get a bit worse and more pervasive.  
</em><br>
<p>I work in software.  Perhaps you are being both strongly
<br>
attracted and repelled by the current conditions?  You love the
<br>
creativity, thrive on the intellectual challenge, and feel
<br>
fulfilled by addressing &quot;the real needs of the industry&quot;.  (Very,
<br>
very few people are so lucky in their jobs.)  But you are also
<br>
strongly repelled by the competitiveness, the deadlines, and
<br>
the pressure.  I once had a job with all the former but none of
<br>
the latter; it was in the heyday of the industry, when we
<br>
were expanding into &quot;free space&quot;;  there were so many things to
<br>
do, and so little competition, that fun *and* high-paying jobs
<br>
were plentiful.  But it couldn't last.  It would be asking too
<br>
much to believe that the economy could produce such jobs, even
<br>
for a tiny minority, forever.  Maybe later, when we have even
<br>
more wealth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some of us even put in way more hours because it is our only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope of &quot;getting ahead&quot; enough to squeeze in what we believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really should be done.  
</em><br>
<p>You may be stuck.  It's possible that you simply couldn't
<br>
stand doing technical writing, or selling insurance, or
<br>
teaching school, or working at McDonalds.  I myself have
<br>
been spoiled.  However, I still think that I could run a
<br>
general store, but it sure wouldn't pay as well.
