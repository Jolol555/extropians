<p>Does this mean your severed head on life support is not you?
<br>
<p>Or, with less drama, if you went paragliding, and fractured your C6
<br>
vertebra, thus severing any direct (anything hormonal would lack the
<br>
bandwidth) neural connection to your &quot;second brain&quot;, you'd become someone
<br>
else?
<br>
<p>(I don't disagree that you need as much context as can get, but as you
<br>
well know, a whole body is not only more expensive than a neuro, but is
<br>
also paid by a neuro of less quality. Given that you *know* there is some
<br>
heavy information erasure going on in your noggin while it is being
<br>
neuropreserved, are you really willing to risk more brain damage for a
<br>
very dubious hypothesis?).
<br>
<p>How much braindamage would you be willing to tolerate for perserving your
<br>
appendix?
