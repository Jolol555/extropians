<em>&gt; Thanks for posting Minsky piece.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Natasha
</em><br>
<p>You're sure welcome, Natasha. My pleasure. I've tried to follow up the Minsky
<br>
piece with some messages about Minsky's _Emotion Machine_, but apparently
<br>
those never got posted. Too long I suppose. So here's the scoop, cut down to
<br>
more postable size.
<br>
<p>Concerning The Emotion Machine
<br>
<a href="http://www.generation5.org/minsky.shtml">http://www.generation5.org/minsky.shtml</a>
<br>
G: We've heard that you're working on the sequel to The Society of the Mind,
<br>
The Emotion Machine, can you briefly describe what this book is about, and
<br>
what you wish to convey?
<br>
<p>M: The central idea is that emotion is not different from thinking. Instead,
<br>
each
<br>
emotion is a type or arrangement of thinking. There is no such thing as
<br>
unemotional thinking, because there always must be a selection of goals, and a
<br>
selection of resources for achieving them.
<br>
<p>G: Is consciousness possible without emotions?
<br>
<p>M: Consciousness is not a 'thing'; it is a just a word that we carelessly use
<br>
for
<br>
several different techniques. Their common feature is that in each type of
<br>
consciousness, some parts of the brain describe what has recently happened in
<br>
various other parts of the brain. The most common forms of this are recognized
<br>
when those descriptions take the form of linguistic expressions or visual
<br>
representations-but there are other ways for parts of the brain to represent
<br>
what has happened in yet other parts of the brain. However, because we cannot
<br>
describe all of these in the usual ways, then, paradoxically, we are
<br>
'unconscious' of some forms of consciousness! I'd say that this has not much
<br>
to do with emotions, except that each emotion engages different mental
<br>
resources, and hence different forms of descriptions.
<br>
<p>-------------------
<br>
<p>This is a chapter from somewhere around the middle of
<br>
The Emotion Machine (a sequel to The Society of Mind)
<br>
<a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/pain990908.html">http://www.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/pain990908.html</a>
<br>
&quot;An area within the functionally complex anterior cingulate cortex has a
<br>
highly selective role in pain processing, consistent with an involvement in
<br>
the characteristic emotional/motivational component (unpleasantness and
<br>
urgency) of pain.&quot; [Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall, 'Pain Mechanisms: A New
<br>
Theory&quot;, Science, 150 p.975, 1965]
<br>
<p>&quot;Morality does not help me. I am one of those who are made for exceptions, not
<br>
for laws. Religion does not help me. The faith that others give to what is
<br>
unseen, I give to what one can touch, and look at. Reason does not help me. It
<br>
tells me that the laws under which I am convicted, and the system under which
<br>
I have suffered are wrong and unjust. But, somehow, I have got to make both of
<br>
these things just and right to me. I have got to make everything that has
<br>
happened to me good for me. The plank bed, the loathsome food, the hard ropes,
<br>
the harsh orders, the dreadful dress that makes sorrow grotesque to look at,
<br>
the I silence, the solitude, the shame--each and all of these things I had to
<br>
transform into a spiritual experience. There is not a single degradation of
<br>
the body which I must not try and make into a spiritualizing of the soul.&quot;
<br>
[extracted b Frederic Rzewski from Oscar Wilde's letter to Lord Alfred
<br>
Douglas, written during the author's imprisonment in Reading.]

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
