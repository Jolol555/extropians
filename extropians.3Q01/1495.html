</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure it does. Example: You spend a trillion dollars or so on a super powerful

</em><br>
<p>Gee John, if that's the solution, why aren't IRVs already painted white?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Many are the potential customers who can afford only one missile,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; North Korea, Iraq, Libya, China, they only plan to have one missile and one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warhead in their arsenal? I don't think so.
</em><br>
<p>At the current time, I believe that China has a ballistic missile fleet
<br>
of 80 ICBMs, but is building more. The first generation SBL (Space Based
<br>
Laser) is designed to destroy a missile in boost phase with firing times
<br>
of 2 seconds per missile, with acquisition times of an additional 3
<br>
seconds. With 20 SBL's launched and in orbit, 100% of the world is
<br>
covered by one SBL at all times, and 20%+ is covered by 2 SBLs at all
<br>
times. Given this, a single SBL could target, acquire, and destroy 80
<br>
ICBMs in under 7 minutes during the boost phase, a phase during which
<br>
decoys are not feasible.
<br>
<p>Increasing the SBL fleet to 40 stations provides coverage of 2-4 SBL's
<br>
over any point over the entire globe at all times, sufficient to
<br>
interdict nuclear attacks of 160-320 missiles in the same 7 minute
<br>
launch window. If missiles are launched over a wider window, then the
<br>
SBL fleet can interdict more missiles.
<br>
<p>As higher power SBLs are developed, firing time per missile can be
<br>
reduced, and as acquisition and targeting technologies increase to
<br>
multi-target acquisition, SBLs can be clustered in orbit on battle
<br>
platforms with shorter acquisition times.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      &gt;and have not the sophistication to actually modify what has already been built.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, this weapon will defend us providing the enemy is poor stupid and ignorant, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember, beer is cheap and beer cans even cheaper.
</em><br>
<p>And just who is most likely to attack us? A country that is highly
<br>
developed with much to lose, or a poor, ignorant country with little to
<br>
lose?
