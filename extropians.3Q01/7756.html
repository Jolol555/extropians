<p>September 21, 2001
<br>
<p>Let me see if I understand this situation correctly. In order to wage
<br>
a war to promote 'freedom' and 'democracy' around the world, it is
<br>
necessary to sacrifice those very democratic freedoms here at home.
<br>
That makes perfect sense to me, as it apparently does to all the flag-
<br>
wavers out there who have fallen victim to the relentless war-
<br>
mongering propaganda being spewed out by our 'independent' media.
<br>
<p>Some of you, by the way, may want to keep those flags readily
<br>
accessible in the coming months and years. They will come in very
<br>
handy to drape over the pine boxes that your sons and daughters will
<br>
be being shipped home in.
<br>
<p>It does seem a bit strange though that the man leading the charge to
<br>
extend 'democracy' to all corners of the globe didn't actually assume
<br>
office through anything even remotely resembling a democratic
<br>
process, but was rather appointed by five men who themselves were
<br>
appointed to office. I guess that's unimportant though, as none of
<br>
our politicians or their fully complicit media hacks have bothered to
<br>
comment on it.
<br>
<p>Still it should be noted that while Sir George rants and raves about
<br>
how Osama bin Laden hates democracy and freedom, it was he and his
<br>
appointers who showed complete contempt for the most basic tenets of
<br>
democracy just ten short months ago. The Supreme Court decision
<br>
signed by Rehnquist did state, in no uncertain terms, that: &quot;The
<br>
individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote for
<br>
electors for the President of the United States.&quot;
<br>
<p>So now we are treated to the repellent spectacle of a man who we had
<br>
no right to vote for - according to the interpreters of our
<br>
Constitution - teaching the world by show of force exactly how
<br>
democracy is practiced. Now isn't that special. It does seem funny
<br>
though that none of the supposed 'liberals' in Washington or in the
<br>
press corps have had a goddamned thing to say about any of that.
<br>
<p>Not a ripple of dissent on Capitol Hill or from the press corps could
<br>
be heard in reaction to Bush's absurd statement to Congress and the
<br>
people Thursday evening that &quot;[The terrorists] hate what they see
<br>
right here in this chamber: a democratically elected government.&quot; Of
<br>
course, it would be difficult to argue with the first part of that
<br>
statement.
<br>
<p>It is certainly true that many of the world's people hate the men and
<br>
women that were in that room, and with good reason. It is not, as
<br>
Bush indicated, because &quot;They hate our freedoms,&quot; but rather because
<br>
they have been driven to unthinkable levels of hatred by having been
<br>
denied their own freedoms for decades - thanks in large part to the
<br>
military interventions designed and implemented by the men in that
<br>
room.
<br>
<p>It is frequently said that those who forget history are condemned to
<br>
repeat its mistakes. George Bush though has not likely forgotten the
<br>
history that is now being repeated. It was, after all, his
<br>
grandfather Prescott Bush and his great-grandfather Herbert Walker
<br>
who had their assets seized by the Alien Property Custodian under the
<br>
Trading With The Enemy Act for operating Nazi front companies during
<br>
World War II.
<br>
<p>That didn't stop Bush from declaring, in his Thursday night speech to
<br>
the one-party Congress, that: &quot;We have seen their kind before.
<br>
They're the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th
<br>
century ... they follow in the path of fascism, Nazism and
<br>
totalitarianism.&quot; Quite a remarkable statement coming from the
<br>
grandson of one of the men who financed the rise and genocidal reign
<br>
of those ideologies.
<br>
<p>Even more remarkable is that he made that statement immediately after
<br>
declaring that: &quot;We're not deceived by their pretensions to piety.&quot;
<br>
Not surprisingly, his trademark smirk could be detected lurking just
<br>
beneath the surface of his feigned earnestness.
<br>
<p>The script that his forebears helped bring to life many decades ago
<br>
has now been dusted off and resurrected by the chosen son. All of the
<br>
elements are already in place. The burning of the symbol of the
<br>
German ship of state, the Reichstag, has been replaced with the
<br>
burning of the symbols of the American ship of state - the World
<br>
Trade Center towers and the Pentagon.
<br>
<p>The devolution of America into an overt police state has already
<br>
begun. War of unthinkable proportions has been declared against a
<br>
wide swath of humanity. The scapegoating and victimization of a
<br>
religious minority has already begun, this time with Muslims filling
<br>
the role previously filled by Jews. A severe economic downturn has
<br>
begun as well, to further inflame the passions of the American people.
<br>
<p>Wake the fuck up, America! Your enemies are not hiding in caves in
<br>
Afghanistan. They are hiding in plain sight. Your enemies are not the
<br>
Arab-Americans who walk among you; your enemies look just like you.
<br>
They do not live half a world away, but are right here in Washington.
<br>
Their faces can be seen daily populating the cable news shows, right
<br>
alongside of their craven propagandists in the U.S. media.
<br>
<p>Their names are Bush, Daschle, Lott, Clinton, Hastert, Byrd, Cheney,
<br>
Rehnquist, Scalia, Powell, Rumsfeld, Ashcroft, Gephardt, and all the
<br>
rest of the human refuse who make up the one-party power structure in
<br>
Washington. They are assisted in their goals by a cast of shitbag
<br>
propagandists named Brokaw, Rather, Jennings, Koppel, O'Reilly,
<br>
Matthews, Russert, and too many others to list here.
<br>
<p>These are the people who would rob you of your freedoms and
<br>
liberties. These are the people who have nothing but the most thinly-
<br>
veiled contempt for democracy, for civil liberties, for human rights,
<br>
for racial tolerance, and for the right of self-determination for
<br>
people everywhere. These are the people who, without so much as a
<br>
hint of shame, would wage genocidal war around the world while
<br>
spouting platitudes about 'democracy.'
<br>
<p>Bush has pledged that &quot;We will direct every resource at our
<br>
command ... every necessary weapon of war.&quot; Make no mistake about it,
<br>
the United States has the capacity and the willingness to kill on an
<br>
unthinkable level. Before we even resort to our 'tactical' nuclear
<br>
weapons, which is a near certainty, America has any number
<br>
of 'unconventional' warfare techniques guaranteed to kill millions,
<br>
all of which have been used in the past.
<br>
<p>There is the low-grade nuclear war that was waged against both Iraq
<br>
and Yugoslavia, by means of depleted uranium shells fired by U.S.
<br>
tanks and warplanes. The radioactive fallout from such weaponry lasts
<br>
for decades, and is continuing to claim lives today in the parts of
<br>
the world where it has been deployed.
<br>
<p>There is also the 'food warfare' made possible by the development of
<br>
self-terminating crop seeds by corrupt international seed cartels -
<br>
technology that could conceivably cause massive levels of starvation.
<br>
Then of course there is weather warfare, which some researchers claim
<br>
America has taken to a whole new level with technology such as the
<br>
HAARP facility in Gakona, Alaska.
<br>
<p>Then there is the type of environmental warfare that was also
<br>
deployed against Iraq and Yugoslavia, where chemical facilities were
<br>
deliberately targeted so as to wage what amounted to indirect
<br>
chemical warfare. In the Serbian city of Pancevo, and in many other
<br>
places, environmental catastrophes of previously unseen proportions
<br>
were deliberately created.
<br>
<p>All of these are quiet killers. The media makes no mention of them
<br>
and their victims go uncounted. The massive environmental damage that
<br>
has poisoned the food and the water go unreported. The 100,000+
<br>
children who continue to die in Iraq every year remain out of site of
<br>
the American people, just as do those who die every time the United
<br>
States launches a cruise missile or drops a 'smart' bomb.
<br>
<p>While actively promoting an unprecedented level of national mourning
<br>
for the victims of the September 11 attacks, our leaders steer
<br>
attention away from the fact that every time the United States flexes
<br>
its military muscle, somewhere in the world a nation mourns. And
<br>
while the death toll in New York and Washington indeed constitutes a
<br>
national tragedy, it pales in comparison to the mourning we have
<br>
caused around the world.
<br>
<p>How much more will we cause now? How many bodies will be added to the
<br>
millions left dead in Vietnam, Korea, Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, El
<br>
Salvador, Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yugoslavia, the Philippines,
<br>
Guatemala, Haiti, Chile, and elsewhere? And how many of the Americans
<br>
who were enraged at footage of Palestinians dancing in the streets
<br>
will cheer and wave their flags when the bombs begin to fall and the
<br>
body parts begin to fly?
<br>
<p>How many will stop to wonder who is actually on the receiving end of
<br>
the bombs? How many will realize that the scene in New York that so
<br>
horrified them is being reproduced on an unimaginable scale, and that
<br>
it is civilians, once again, who are being buried in the rubble? And
<br>
how many will occasionally stop to ponder how the German people could
<br>
have been led like lambs to support such atrocities?
