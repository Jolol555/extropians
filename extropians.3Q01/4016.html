</em><br>
<p>This is a very persistent male myth. And it makes a lot of sense
<br>
from the male point of view and basic male hormonal wiring.  It
<br>
does not feel that way from this side often for many of us.  Sex
<br>
doesn't hit the same way on this side.  There is much more
<br>
involved.  Sex drives manifest differently and have different
<br>
ramifications.  The normal generalities apply.  Females need to
<br>
know the partner is trustworthy and will stick around. Females
<br>
have more emotional aspects to sexuality (as a generality) and
<br>
so on.  So on this side, just getting laid is not the primary
<br>
interest.  This is not to say we don't get horny and sometimes
<br>
simply want to get laid just as much as guys do.  But until the
<br>
advent of reasonable contraception this was not so simple a
<br>
proposition or one not fraught with possible repurcussions. Even
<br>
with the pill it entails a lot more emotional complications
<br>
generally for women than men.   
<br>
<p>It is more difficult from this side to have sex just for sex
<br>
sake.  Or at least I find it so.  If I can't let the person into
<br>
my heart deeply then the sex part by itself is less fun that
<br>
masturbation and much more troublesome.   
<br>
<p>Being a changeling I was surprised how much difference the
<br>
diffferent hormonal mix made and how quickly.  For a very short
<br>
while it was almost as much fun after the change as you
<br>
envision.  Then my head and heart began to change very rapidly. 
<br>
It has led me to an experential based belief that the hormones
<br>
activate and inhibit a slew of built-in instinctual patterns as
<br>
well as effectively rewiring the emotions differently. I believe
<br>
this largely accounts for the actual versus the societally
<br>
constructed difference in the genders.
<br>
<p>I have seen the reverse happen with female-to-male TS people I
<br>
have known.  I remember one saying that since he started
<br>
testosterone he was so horny that he often feared he would go a
<br>
utterly mad and do something totally uncouth.
