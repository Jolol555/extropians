<em>&gt; I:

<em>&gt; a) lost out on an appointment to a military academy
</em><br>
<p>So did I... West Point.  I had the highest SAT scores
<br>
in the State of Washington that year too.  It wasn't
<br>
an ethnic minority that got my slot, however, it was
<br>
another white male who just happen to be a better
<br>
student and athlete than me.
<br>
<p>Few slots, many applicants.  How do you know an ethnic
<br>
minority got a slot which would have been yours? 
<br>
Maybe you lost out because there were simply other
<br>
people more qualified than you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; b) lost out on financial aid in college, which was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biased to provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more aid to people of the same economic level if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were minorities.
</em><br>
<p>Did you get your education anyway... despite losing
<br>
out on financial aid?  Do you think it's possible that
<br>
some of those black students might not have gotten
<br>
their educations at all if they had lost out?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; c) am constantly accused of being a

</em><br>
<p>I don't think it's simply because you are a white
<br>
male... But more because you say things like &quot;am
<br>
constantly accused of being a racist/sexist/'rich
<br>
elite' simply because I am a white male.&quot;
<br>
<p>Like I said, I was a white male... and I never got
<br>
accused of being racist (or sexist, for that matter). 
<br>
If you are constantly being accused of being racist,
<br>
maybe you should take a look at your words and
<br>
actions.  It isn't just because you are a white male.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In my experience, the only lack of opportunity that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blacks I've known have had has been produced by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own memetic programming, and not by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the system. When you are programmed to expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racism, that is exactly what you will get.
</em><br>
<p>Racism is caused by the people being discriminated
<br>
against, simply becuase they believe it exists?
<br>
<p>You didn't really just say that, did you?
<br>
<p>Your being discriminated against is real... their's is
<br>
all in their heads?
<br>
<p>Mike... I have no trouble at all believing you are a
<br>
good person who would never engage in overt acts of
<br>
discrimination... but you have deluded yourself if you
<br>
think that blacks bring it all on themselves... and it
<br>
is statements like that which result in you being
<br>
called racist... it has nothing to do with the color
<br>
of your skin.
