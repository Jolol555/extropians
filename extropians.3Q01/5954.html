&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 46'th update of my fly longevity experiments. All bottles
<br>
contain 1/4 tsp citric acid as a standard additive, except lemon and lime
<br>
juice bottles, which already contain citric acid. Additional potassium has
<br>
improved survival in a published experiment, and according to my last
<br>
update, it also does appear to improve survival when acetic acid is used
<br>
as an additive.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both lemon, and lime can induce phototoxic reactions, so it is perhaps
<br>
not too surprising that they reduce survival. The current results strongly
<br>
suggest that potassium does not aid survival in citric acid treated flies.
<br>
The tartrate salt in contrast appears to be quite toxic. I had earlier
<br>
found tartaric acid itself to be toxic. It is possible that current fly
<br>
food batches may have an increased potassium content. If so this could
<br>
account for the null result with potassium.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the summer months longevity decreases. For this experiment
<br>
average temperature was 25 C. The limiting factor in fly survival under
<br>
optimal conditions is known to be due to motor neuron degeneration.
<br>
However few of the flies in the current experiment lost the ability to fly
<br>
before expiring, so some other factor is responsible for their deaths.
<br>
Acid addition prevents molds and bacteria from inducing visible changes to
<br>
the fly food. As a result I doubt that these pathogens are responsible for
<br>
the early mortality. The literature is surprisingly sparce it its
<br>
examination of other causes of fly mortality. However it is apparent that
<br>
pathogens are a factor in published experiments. The experimental group
<br>
headed Dr Harold Massie has duplicated a number of experiments that found
<br>
large increases in survival with certain additives, and consistently
<br>
obtained null results under clean room conditions. Massie himself
<br>
attributed these contradictory results to the confounding effects of
<br>
pathogens. I believe the most likely explanation of the early deaths my
<br>
own experiments are now experiencing is due to viral infections. Acids
<br>
would not affect most of these, and flies are known to harbor a wide
<br>
variety iof viruses. It is intriguing that death due to pathogens in aged
<br>
humans is almost exclusively from viral infections. This is how one of my
<br>
own grandmothers expired.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grape skins are known to exert an antiviral effect. This may account
<br>
for the my own past positive results with grape juice, as well as grape
<br>
containing elderberry juice. In the next run I will further investigate
<br>
these.
