<br>
<p>Let's ask Bill Clinton, after he says the subject line 10 times,
<br>
quickly.
<br>
Any reason why a Louisiana Whore House shouldn't get registered as a
<br>
&quot;church&quot; and apply for &quot;faith-based public works&quot; money? The biggest
<br>
whores in society are the religiocrats. So &quot;faith-based
<br>
prostitution&quot; should be funded without discrimination.

<em>&gt; Last November the American people and the Electoral College elected a

the

President
<br>
<em>&gt; Bush's favorite hymn, as he repeatedly has told us, is &quot;A Charge to
</em><br>
Keep I
<br>
<em>&gt; Have,&quot; the next three lines of which are: &quot;a God to glorify/a never

dying

</em><br>
Catholic
<br>
<em>&gt; would demur from the implied Pelagianism of these words, but
</em><br>
Methodists, at
<br>
<em>&gt; least devout ones, do not. They save their own souls; they fit them
</em><br>
for the
<br>
<em>&gt; sky. And one of the indispensable ways they do this is through good
</em><br>
works.
<br>
<em>&gt; Now, thanks to President's Bush's leadership, those good works will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; federally funded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President Bush's theology explains much about his administration's
</em><br>
policies.
<br>
<em>&gt; For at least a year he has been meeting privately with Roman Catholic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bishops, cardinals, and cardinals-to-be. John F. Kennedy himself,
</em><br>
precisely
<br>
<em>&gt; because he was a Roman Catholic, probably could not have gotten away
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt; the sort of private audiences President Bush has been keeping with
</em><br>
prelates
<br>
<em>&gt; of the Roman Church-State. Besides, Kennedy seemed to prefer private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meetings with floozies, for which the American people ought to be
</em><br>
thankful.
<br>
<em>&gt; When it comes to the preferred vices of rulers, ordinary strumpets
</em><br>
trump
<br>
<em>&gt; spiritual strumpets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Roman Church-State, whose social teaching and some of whose
</em><br>
theology
<br>
<em>&gt; President Bush has adopted as his own, is described by the Holy Spirit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speaking in Scripture with these words: &quot;Come and I will show you the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters, with whom the
</em><br>
kings of
<br>
<em>&gt; the Earth committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the Earth were
</em><br>
made
<br>
<em>&gt; drunk with the wine of her fornication. And the woman whom you saw is
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; great city [which sits on seven hills] which reigns over the kings of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; Earth&quot; (Revelation 17).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rome reigns over our king. George W. Bush has made it clear that he
</em><br>
endorses
<br>
<em>&gt; the social teaching of the Roman Church-State. In his May 20, 2001,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commencement address at Notre Dame (Our Lady) University, President
</em><br>
Bush
<br>
<em>&gt; said,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Notre Dame, as a Catholic university, carries forward a great
</em><br>
tradition of
<br>
<em>&gt; social teaching. It calls on all of us, Catholic and non-Catholic, to
</em><br>
honor
<br>
<em>&gt; family, (1)to protect life in all its stages, to serve and uplift the
</em><br>
poor.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Karl Rove, the President's long-time adviser, speaking to the National
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Catholic Leadership Forum in Washington on April 25, said that
</em><br>
President
<br>
<em>&gt; Bush's compassionate conservatism fits well with the Roman
</em><br>
Church-State's
<br>
<em>&gt; principles of subsidiarity and solidarity. &quot;Catholic teaching is
</em><br>
between
<br>
<em>&gt; libertarian indifference and bureaucratic centralization,&quot; Rove said.
</em><br>
Other
<br>
<em>&gt; speakers, including Steven Wagner, editor of Crisis magazine and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Republican Party's new National Chairman for Catholic Outreach, said
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; President Bush &quot;talks the Catholic language.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A Holy War on Poverty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is more of that &quot;Catholic language&quot; from the President's Notre
</em><br>
Dame
<br>
<em>&gt; address:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In 1964, the year I started college, another President from Texas
</em><br>
delivered
<br>
<em>&gt; a commencement address talking about this national commitment [to the
</em><br>
poor].
<br>
<em>&gt; In that speech, Lyndon Johnson advocated a War on Poverty which had
</em><br>
noble
<br>
<em>&gt; intentions and some enduring successes. Poor families got basic health
</em><br>
care;
<br>
<em>&gt; disadvantaged children were given a Head Start in life. In 1966 [sic;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct date: 1996] welfare reform confronted the first of these
</em><br>
problems
<br>
<em>&gt; [created by the War on Poverty]. But our work is only half done. Now
</em><br>
we must
<br>
<em>&gt; confront the second problem: to revive the spirit of citizenship.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Welfare as we know it has ended, but poverty has not. We do not yet
</em><br>
know
<br>
<em>&gt; what will happen to these men and women, or to their children. But we
</em><br>
cannot
<br>
<em>&gt; sit and watch, leaving them to their own struggles and their own fate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jewish prophets and Catholic teaching both speak of God's special
</em><br>
concern
<br>
<em>&gt; for the poor. This is perhaps the most radical teaching of faith.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mother Teresa said that what the poor often need, even more than
</em><br>
shelter and
<br>
<em>&gt; food is to be wanted. This is my message today: There is no Great
</em><br>
Society
<br>
<em>&gt; which is not a caring society. And any effective War on Poverty must
</em><br>
deploy
<br>
<em>&gt; what Dorothy Day called &quot;the weapons of the spirit.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not sufficient to praise charities and community groups, we must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support them. And this is both a public obligation and a personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The War on Poverty established a federal commitment to the poor. The
</em><br>
welfare
<br>
<em>&gt; reform legislation of 1996 made that commitment more effective. For
</em><br>
the task
<br>
<em>&gt; ahead, we must move to the third stage of combatting [sic] poverty in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Government has an important role. It will never be replaced by
</em><br>
charities. My
<br>
<em>&gt; administration increased funding for major social welfare and poverty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs by 8 percent. Yet government must also do more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I have created a White House Office of Faith-based and Community
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Initiatives. Through that Office we are working to ensure that local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community helpers and healers receive more federal dollars. We have
</em><br>
proposed
<br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;Compassion Capital Fund,&quot; that will match private giving with
</em><br>
federal
<br>
<em>&gt; dollars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And we're in the process of implementing and expanding &quot;Charitable
</em><br>
Choice&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; the principle, already established in federal law, that faith-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizations should not suffer discrimination when they compete for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contracts to provide social services. Government should never fund the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teaching of faith, but it should support the good works of the
</em><br>
faithful.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some critics of this approach object to the idea of government funding
</em><br>
going
<br>
<em>&gt; to any group motivated by faith. But they should take a look around
</em><br>
them.
<br>
<em>&gt; Public money already goes to groups like the Center for the Homeless
</em><br>
and, on
<br>
<em>&gt; a larger scale, Catholic Charities. Do the critics really want them
</em><br>
cut off?
<br>
<em>&gt; Medicaid and Medicare money currently goes to religious hospitals.
</em><br>
Should
<br>
<em>&gt; this practice be ended? Child care vouchers for low income families
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; redeemed every day at houses of worship across America. Should this be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevented? Government loans send countless students to religious
</em><br>
colleges.
<br>
<em>&gt; Should that be banned? Of course not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Groups of this type [Habitat for Humanity] currently receive some
</em><br>
funding
<br>
<em>&gt; from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The budget I
</em><br>
submit to
<br>
<em>&gt; Congress next year will propose a three-fold increase in this funding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The federal government should do all these things; but others have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibilities as well including corporate America. But if we hope
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; substantially reduce poverty and suffering in our country, corporate
</em><br>
America
<br>
<em>&gt; needs to give more - and to give better. Faith-based organizations
</em><br>
receive
<br>
<em>&gt; only a tiny percentage of overall corporate giving..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will convene a summit this fall, asking corporate and philanthropic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaders throughout America to join me at the White House to discuss
</em><br>
ways
<br>
<em>&gt; they can provide more support to community organizations - both
</em><br>
secular and
<br>
<em>&gt; religious..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I leave you with this challenge: serve a neighbor in need.because the
</em><br>
same
<br>
<em>&gt; God who endows us with individual rights also calls us to social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obligations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now where did these ideas come from? Dr. Marvin Olasky, advisor to
</em><br>
President
<br>
<em>&gt; Bush, Professor of Journalism at the University of Texas, Senior
</em><br>
Fellow of
<br>
<em>&gt; the Roman Catholic Acton Institute, and editor of the pro-Roman
</em><br>
Catholic
<br>
<em>&gt; World magazine, is generally credited with coining the term
</em><br>
&quot;compassionate
<br>
<em>&gt; conservatism&quot;; but he is not the source of these ideas. True, Olasky
</em><br>
was
<br>
<em>&gt; present at the White House on January 29, 2001, when President Bush
</em><br>
signed
<br>
<em>&gt; the Executive Order creating the new Office of Faith-Based
</em><br>
Initiatives, but
<br>
<em>&gt; many others were there too: Charles Colson, whose Prison Fellowship
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; Justice Fellowship hope to get more taxpayer money; Dr. James Skillen,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; president of the Center for Public Justice, a think tank promoting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith-based policies; Michael Joyce, president of the Bradley
</em><br>
Foundation, a
<br>
<em>&gt; conservative foundation promoting faith-based policies; and
</em><br>
representatives
<br>
<em>&gt; from the Association of Gospel Rescue Missions, The Salvation Army,
</em><br>
Teen
<br>
<em>&gt; Challenge, Habitat for Humanity, the Islam Center of America, Young
</em><br>
Life,
<br>
<em>&gt; World Vision, and so on. They all stand to gain financially from the
</em><br>
new
<br>
<em>&gt; policy, and have found their &quot;place at the table,&quot; or more accurately,
</em><br>
at
<br>
<em>&gt; the trough. The love of money, as some long forgotten person once
</em><br>
wrote, is
<br>
<em>&gt; a root of all kinds of evil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In his Notre Dame speech President Bush cited as authorities Dorothy
</em><br>
Day, a
<br>
<em>&gt; Roman Catholic social worker and socialist of the 1930s, and Mother
</em><br>
Teresa,
<br>
<em>&gt; a Roman Catholic social worker of the late 20th century. Both of them
</em><br>
echo
<br>
<em>&gt; the collectivist social teaching of the Roman Church-State, which is
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; source of Bush's ideas, as he suggested at the beginning of his
</em><br>
address.
<br>
<em>&gt; That social teaching, as I have demonstrated in detail in my book,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ecclesiastical Megalomania: The Economic and Political Thought of the
</em><br>
Roman
<br>
<em>&gt; Catholic Church, is Antichristian, pagan in origin, and has spawned at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various times fascism, socialism, corporativism, feudalism, and the
</em><br>
welfare
<br>
<em>&gt; state. It is this collectivist teaching that the President thinks &quot;our
</em><br>
world
<br>
<em>&gt; needs to hear,&quot; as he said in his remarks at the dedication of the
</em><br>
Pope John
<br>
<em>&gt; Paul II Cultural Center at Catholic University in Washington, D.C., on
</em><br>
March
<br>
<em>&gt; 22:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm grateful that Pope John Paul II chose Washington as the site of
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; Center. It brings honor and it fills a need. We are thankful for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message. We are also thankful for the messenger, for his personal
</em><br>
warmth and
<br>
<em>&gt; prophetic strength.. Always, the Pope points us to the things that
</em><br>
last and
<br>
<em>&gt; the love that saves. We thank God for this rare man, a servant of God
</em><br>
and a
<br>
<em>&gt; hero..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In remarks preceding the dedication, made while receiving Roman
</em><br>
Church-State
<br>
<em>&gt; cardinals, bishops, and other leaders in the East Room of the White
</em><br>
House,
<br>
<em>&gt; President Bush said,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've been struck by how humble the good folks [the prelates] are; how
</em><br>
there'
<br>
<em>&gt; s a universal love for mankind and a deep concern for those who are
</em><br>
not as
<br>
<em>&gt; fortunate as some of us. The Catholic Church is fortunate to have such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong, capable, decent leadership. And America is fortunate to have
</em><br>
such
<br>
<em>&gt; strong leaders in our midst.. All of you are part of the humanizing
</em><br>
mission
<br>
<em>&gt; which is part of the &quot;Great Commission,&quot; and the Pope John Paul II
</em><br>
Cultural
<br>
<em>&gt; Center.will bring this message to generations of Americans in this
</em><br>
capital
<br>
<em>&gt; of our nation. The best way to honor Pope John Paul II, truly one of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; great men, is to take his teachings seriously; is to listen to his
</em><br>
words and
<br>
<em>&gt; put his words and teachings into action here in America. This is a
</em><br>
challenge
<br>
<em>&gt; we must accept.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As Princeton University's McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence and
</em><br>
Director
<br>
<em>&gt; of the James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions,
</em><br>
Robert
<br>
<em>&gt; George, remarked in the National Catholic Register, &quot;Bush made clear
</em><br>
that he
<br>
<em>&gt; is not backing away from his faith-based initiative, despite criticism
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; some, not all, evangelical leaders and many libertarians.. What Bush
</em><br>
is, in
<br>
<em>&gt; effect, stating is that 'I am a John Paul II Republican..'&quot; Professor
</em><br>
George
<br>
<em>&gt; is, of course, a Roman Catholic. And President Bush is indeed a John
</em><br>
Paul II
<br>
<em>&gt; Republican. (2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Despite what Professor George implied, the President has met with
</em><br>
virtually
<br>
<em>&gt; no opposition from so-called evangelical leaders. Christianity Today,
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; example, enthusiastically endorsed the Bush plan in its April 2 issue,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying, &quot;Bush's plan.is great.&quot; Those most often cited as opponents -
</em><br>
Jerry
<br>
<em>&gt; Falwell and Pat Robertson, for example - do not oppose the program in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle; they just grouse about money possibly going to
</em><br>
&quot;non-mainstream
<br>
<em>&gt; religions.&quot; Pat Robertson has endorsed Bush's plan as &quot;an excellent
</em><br>
idea.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; The ersatz evangelicals are not only supporting the President's plan
</em><br>
now,
<br>
<em>&gt; they have been supporting it all along. His legislative program is
</em><br>
being
<br>
<em>&gt; pushed in the House of Representatives by a Baptist minister, J. C.
</em><br>
Watts of
<br>
<em>&gt; Oklahoma, and in the Senate by Joseph Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Connecticut, and Rick Santorum, a Roman Catholic from Pennsylvania.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Faith-Based Foolishness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Central to President Bush's program is &quot;faith.&quot; This faith seems at
</em><br>
first to
<br>
<em>&gt; be quite independent of any doctrine, for the President makes it clear
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; his administration will fund &quot;Methodists, Mormons, and Muslims.&quot; &quot;We
</em><br>
will
<br>
<em>&gt; help all in their work to change hearts while keeping a commitment to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pluralism.&quot; (3) Obviously this sort of faith has nothing to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christianity; in fact, it is inimical to Christianity. Secular social
</em><br>
reform
<br>
<em>&gt; efforts, according to the President, have failed because they cannot
</em><br>
change
<br>
<em>&gt; hearts, but &quot;people of faith&quot; can change hearts, and the government
</em><br>
will
<br>
<em>&gt; help them do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some misguided and foolish Christians think that only Christ can
</em><br>
change
<br>
<em>&gt; lives, and they therefore preach the false gospel of the changed life.
</em><br>
They
<br>
<em>&gt; do not understand either Christianity or false religions. One of the
</em><br>
most
<br>
<em>&gt; impressive testimony meetings I have ever attended was in the First
</em><br>
Church
<br>
<em>&gt; of Christ, Scientist. Moslems, Mormons, Methodists, and Mariolaters
</em><br>
can give
<br>
<em>&gt; similar testimonies: &quot;The Koran, or Holy Mother Church, or the Queen
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; Heaven, or the Saints have changed my life.&quot; The natural man can
</em><br>
believe and
<br>
<em>&gt; does believe many varieties of false religions, some of which may
</em><br>
indeed
<br>
<em>&gt; help him curb his drunkenness or his womanizing or his wife beating.
</em><br>
But
<br>
<em>&gt; none of these religions is true; none can save his soul; only the
</em><br>
finished
<br>
<em>&gt; work of Christ, accepted in simple faith, can do that. And it is
</em><br>
precisely
<br>
<em>&gt; this message of the Gospel that all these religions and government
</em><br>
policies
<br>
<em>&gt; oppose. When fans of faith-based organizations say they want results,
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; are demanding results that they can observe, record, quantify, and
</em><br>
subject
<br>
<em>&gt; to statistical analysis. They could care less about the souls of those
</em><br>
on
<br>
<em>&gt; whom they operate. If Mohammedanism can produce sober citizens from
</em><br>
drunks,
<br>
<em>&gt; more tax money and power to it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today it is common to hear that faith helps people recover from
</em><br>
accidents
<br>
<em>&gt; and illness; faith helps them put their lives and families back
</em><br>
together,
<br>
<em>&gt; or, as President Bush puts it, &quot;Social scientists have documented the
</em><br>
power
<br>
<em>&gt; of religion to protect families and change lives. Studies indicate
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; religious involvement reduces teen pregnancy, suicide, drug addiction,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abuse, alcoholism, and crime.&quot; Ronald Sider, writing in Christianity
</em><br>
Today
<br>
<em>&gt; (June 11, 2001), informs us that &quot;a growing body of research
</em><br>
demonstrates
<br>
<em>&gt; that religion often goes hand in hand with good citizenship and
</em><br>
overall
<br>
<em>&gt; health.&quot; Which religion? It doesn't seem to matter for faith-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foolishness. Mormonism works as well as Christianity, and the messages
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; Prophet Mohammed and the Apparition Mary are as effective as the
</em><br>
Gospel of
<br>
<em>&gt; Christ. They all work. And the President has made it clear that he
</em><br>
wants
<br>
<em>&gt; results.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now this exploitation of religion by government for government's
</em><br>
purposes
<br>
<em>&gt; has been the story of humanity, from the Fall of man to the 21st
</em><br>
century.
<br>
<em>&gt; Fascism is not a new idea, invented by Mussolini and Hitler in the
</em><br>
20th
<br>
<em>&gt; century. Attila, the man of force, has frequently used the
</em><br>
Witchdoctor, the
<br>
<em>&gt; man of superstition, or formed a partnership with the Witchdoctor, in
</em><br>
order
<br>
<em>&gt; to control the people and maintain power. Faith-based fascism is but
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; latest example of this religio-political partnership. Ronald Sider,
</em><br>
writing
<br>
<em>&gt; in Christianity Today, unwittingly put it this way:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scholars.cite a wide range of studies showing that &quot;religion is
</em><br>
strongly
<br>
<em>&gt; associated with good citizenship and improved physical and mental
</em><br>
health.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; Active participation in a religious group correlates with lower
</em><br>
suicide
<br>
<em>&gt; rates, drug use, and criminal behavior; better health; and altruistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior.. [While] Nonreligious funders [contributors to charitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization] may overlook a perfunctory prayer to start the day,
</em><br>
.they
<br>
<em>&gt; often refuse to support holistic social programs run by Christians who
</em><br>
think
<br>
<em>&gt; that encouraging the adoption of a specific religious faith is an
</em><br>
essential
<br>
<em>&gt; component of their social program.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sider makes it clear: The adoption of a specific religious faith is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; component of a social program. This is theological paganism, a
</em><br>
complete
<br>
<em>&gt; reversal of Christian doctrine and priorities, which teach that all
</em><br>
social
<br>
<em>&gt; programs (if there are any at all) are secondary at best, and that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proclamation of the Gospel and the whole counsel of God is primary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christians are to set their minds on things above, not on earthly
</em><br>
things.
<br>
<em>&gt; They are to fear him who can destroy both body and soul, not him who
</em><br>
can
<br>
<em>&gt; kill only the body. They are to recognize that a person is not what he
</em><br>
eats,
<br>
<em>&gt; but what he thinks. They are to teach that God's kingdom comes, not by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might, nor by power, but by his Spirit working in the minds of men.
</em><br>
They are
<br>
<em>&gt; to warn all men that this earthly life is brief, and the things of
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; world are passing away; that wrath is coming, and the life (or death)
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; follows the Judgment is everlasting. They are to warn everyone that
</em><br>
what
<br>
<em>&gt; they think of Jesus Christ will result in their everlasting happiness
</em><br>
or
<br>
<em>&gt; their never-ending agony.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Great Commission is not a component of some larger social program;
</em><br>
it is
<br>
<em>&gt; the whole program, and it is not social. Whatever charitable works are
</em><br>
done
<br>
<em>&gt; by individuals, private organizations, and churches (not governments,
</em><br>
whose
<br>
<em>&gt; purpose is the punishment of evildoers, not the ministry of mercy) are
</em><br>
to be
<br>
<em>&gt; done in the furtherance of that mission. To reverse ends and means is
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; deny the Gospel. Christ said, contradicting Ronald Sider and all other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proponents of the Social Gospel, &quot;Seek first the kingdom of God and
</em><br>
his
<br>
<em>&gt; righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.&quot; To make
</em><br>
earthly
<br>
<em>&gt; things the goal, and to make the kingdom of God and his righteousness
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; means, is a damnable perversion of Christianity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Writing of an earlier proposal to bastardize Christianity and make it
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; useful contributor to good citizenship and a component of a social
</em><br>
program,
<br>
<em>&gt; J. Gresham Machen said,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We find proposed to us today what is called &quot;character education&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;character building.&quot; Character, we are told, is one thing about which
</em><br>
men
<br>
<em>&gt; of all faiths are agreed. Let us, therefore, build character in
</em><br>
common, as
<br>
<em>&gt; good citizens, and then welcome from the various religious faiths
</em><br>
whatever
<br>
<em>&gt; additional aid they can severally bring.. What surprises me about this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program is not that its advocates propose it, for it is only too well
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; accord with the spirit of the age. But what really surprises me about
</em><br>
it is
<br>
<em>&gt; that the advocates of it seem to think that a Christian can support it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without ceasing at that point to be Christian. (4)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today, the so-called evangelicals are mindlessly parroting the pious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bromides of the modernists and Social Gospelers of 75 years ago. To
</em><br>
state it
<br>
<em>&gt; more clearly, many of those we now call evangelicals are in fact
</em><br>
modernists.
<br>
<em>&gt; They have abandoned Christianity. And what pious fascists call &quot;social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justice&quot; are the sins of envy and theft.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Faith-based Fascism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The 16th century Cardinal Tommaso Cajetan, a determined opponent of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; Reformation, explained very clearly the Roman Catholic theology behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith-based fascism:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now what a ruler can do in virtue of his office, so that justice may
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; served in the matter of riches, is to take from someone who is
</em><br>
unwilling to
<br>
<em>&gt; dispense from what is superfluous for life or state [condition], and
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; distribute it to the poor.. For according to the teaching of the
</em><br>
saints, the
<br>
<em>&gt; riches that are superfluous do not belong to the rich man as his own,
</em><br>
but
<br>
<em>&gt; rather to the one appointed by God as dispenser, so that he can have
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; merit of a good dispensation. (5)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The same theological and moral justification of stealing by government
</em><br>
has
<br>
<em>&gt; been stated by many popes, councils, and theologians throughout the
</em><br>
long and
<br>
<em>&gt; bloody history of the Roman Church-State. Using the principles of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universal destination of goods and subsidiarity, the Roman
</em><br>
Church-State
<br>
<em>&gt; concocted the most comprehensive case for economic and political
</em><br>
fascism the
<br>
<em>&gt; world has ever seen. It is this social teaching that President Bush
</em><br>
praises,
<br>
<em>&gt; follows, and urges all of us to follow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, he is not the first modern political leader to do so.
</em><br>
Amintore
<br>
<em>&gt; Fanfani, Premier of Italy in the mid-twentieth century, published a
</em><br>
book
<br>
<em>&gt; titled Catholicism, Protestantism and Capitalism in 1934. Fanfani
</em><br>
presented
<br>
<em>&gt; the Roman Church-State's social teaching and concluded that &quot;the
</em><br>
essence of
<br>
<em>&gt; capitalism.can only meet with the most decided repugnance on the part
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; Catholicism.&quot; What is that essence? Individualism, the private
</em><br>
property
<br>
<em>&gt; order, freedom of enterprise, freedom of association, freedom of
</em><br>
religion.
<br>
<em>&gt; Fanfani, like many Protestant-poseurs today, longed for the good old
</em><br>
days,
<br>
<em>&gt; the feudalism of the Middle Ages:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The pre-capitalist age is the period in which definite social
</em><br>
institutions
<br>
<em>&gt; such as, for instance, the Church, the State, the Guild, act as
</em><br>
guardians of
<br>
<em>&gt; an economic order that is not based on criteria of individual economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utility. The Corporation or Guild is typical of the period. It is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guardian of a system of economic activity in which the purely economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests of the individual are sacrificed either to the moral and
</em><br>
religious
<br>
<em>&gt; interests of the individual-the attainment of which is under the
</em><br>
control of
<br>
<em>&gt; special public institutions-or to the economic and extra-economic
</em><br>
interests
<br>
<em>&gt; of the community. Competition was restricted; the distribution of
</em><br>
customers,
<br>
<em>&gt; hence a minimum of work, was assured; a certain system of work was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compulsory; trade with various groups [guess whom] might be forbidden
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; political or religious reasons; certain practices were compulsory, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working hours were limited; there were a number of compulsory feasts;
</em><br>
prices
<br>
<em>&gt; and rates of increase were fixed; measures were taken to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speculation. (6)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This fascist organization of society was a result of the social
</em><br>
teaching of
<br>
<em>&gt; the Roman Church-State, and it has been a result of that teaching
</em><br>
wherever
<br>
<em>&gt; the Roman Church-State has been powerful enough to impose its will on
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; nation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Roman Catholic historian Christopher Dawson, writing in 1936 in
</em><br>
Religion and
<br>
<em>&gt; the Modern State, acknowledged Romanism's affinity for fascism:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Roman Catholicism] is by no means hostile to the authoritarian ideal
</em><br>
of the
<br>
<em>&gt; State.. [T]he [Roman] Church has always maintained the principles of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authority and hierarchy and a high conception of the prerogatives of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; State. [Roman Catholic social ideas] have far more affinity with those
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; fascism than with those of either [Classical] Liberalism or Socialism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [They] correspond much more closely, at least in theory, with the
</em><br>
fascist
<br>
<em>&gt; conception of the functions of the &quot;leader&quot; and the vocational
</em><br>
hierarchy of
<br>
<em>&gt; the Fascist State than they do with the system of parliamentary
</em><br>
democratic
<br>
<em>&gt; party government..(7)

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Joy of Fascism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who supports this faith-based fascism? Most if not all the Religious
</em><br>
Right,
<br>
<em>&gt; including groups such as the Family Research Council and the Christian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Coalition; the Roman Church-State, of course; conservatives; a
</em><br>
considerable
<br>
<em>&gt; army of nonprofit organizations, such as the Hudson Institute, that
</em><br>
receive
<br>
<em>&gt; money from the government and spin out &quot;scholarly&quot; studies allegedly
</em><br>
showing
<br>
<em>&gt; why government funding of faith-based organizations is the answer to
</em><br>
social
<br>
<em>&gt; problems; wealthy foundations, such as the Pew Charitable Trusts and
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; Bradley Foundation, that also fund such stupid studies; Charles Colson
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; Prison Fellowship and Ronald Sider of Evangelicals for Social Action,
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; well as other advocates of the Social Gospel; and even some foolish
</em><br>
people
<br>
<em>&gt; who call themselves Reformed Christians, of whom we shall have more to
</em><br>
say
<br>
<em>&gt; later.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The man heading the President's Office of Faith-based and Community
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Initiatives, Dr. John J. DiIulio, is a former member of the board of
</em><br>
Prison
<br>
<em>&gt; Fellowship. Calling himself a &quot;born-again Catholic,&quot; DiIulio explains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot;: &quot;Compassionate conservatism warmly
</em><br>
welcomes
<br>
<em>&gt; godly people back into the public square.. It fosters model
</em><br>
public/private
<br>
<em>&gt; partnerships..&quot; Quoting a July 22, 1999, speech by Governor Bush,
</em><br>
DiIulio
<br>
<em>&gt; says that Bush rejected the &quot;destructive&quot; idea that &quot;if government
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; only get out of the way, all our problems would be solved.&quot; Two years
</em><br>
later,
<br>
<em>&gt; on January 29, 2001, President Bush asserted, and he has repeated it
</em><br>
many
<br>
<em>&gt; times since, &quot;Government cannot be replaced by charities or
</em><br>
volunteers.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; President Bush clearly rejects the Biblical view of limited
</em><br>
government.
<br>
<em>&gt; Rather than restricting government to its only legitimate role, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; punishment of evildoers, as Paul says in Romans 13, President Bush
</em><br>
wants to
<br>
<em>&gt; involve government further in society by expanding the
</em><br>
&quot;government-by-proxy&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; fascism that already grips America. DiIulio explained the plan to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) on March 7:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since the end of World War II, virtually every domestic policy program
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; Washington has funded in whole or in part has been administered not by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; federal civil servants alone (there are about 2 million of those
</em><br>
today,
<br>
<em>&gt; roughly the same number as in 1960), but by federal workers in
</em><br>
conjunction
<br>
<em>&gt; with state and local government employees, for-profit firms, and
</em><br>
non-profit
<br>
<em>&gt; organizations. There are, for example, six people who work indirectly
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; Washington for every one federal bureaucrat who administers social
</em><br>
programs.
<br>
<em>&gt; Certain nonprofit organizations, both religious and secular, have long
</em><br>
been
<br>
<em>&gt; funded in whole or in part through this federal government-by-proxy
</em><br>
system.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Catholic Charities, for example, gets 65 percent of its $2.3 billion
</em><br>
annual
<br>
<em>&gt; budget from government. The Jewish Board of Family and Children
</em><br>
Services
<br>
<em>&gt; receives 75 percent of its funding from government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Far from objecting to this fascist government-by-proxy system, with
</em><br>
its
<br>
<em>&gt; network of public-private &quot;partnerships&quot; and government &quot;coordination&quot;
</em><br>
(such
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;partnerships&quot; and &quot;coordination&quot; are characteristics of fascism),
</em><br>
DiIulio
<br>
<em>&gt; intends to extend this fascist system to include even more
</em><br>
organizations and
<br>
<em>&gt; people, specifically religious organizations. He exults in the fact
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; under federal law signed by President Clinton in 1996, &quot;sacred places
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; serve civic purposes can seek federal (or federal-state) funding
</em><br>
without
<br>
<em>&gt; having to divest themselves of their religious iconography or
</em><br>
symbols..
<br>
<em>&gt; [N]uns in habits [can] rub shoulders with Americorps volunteers.&quot; and
</em><br>
so on.
<br>
<em>&gt; He finds such prospects delightful because at the present time there
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; anti-Catholic discrimination: &quot;Catholics who believe and follow the
</em><br>
Church's
<br>
<em>&gt; official teachings on social issues 'need not apply' to many secular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonprofits presently funded, in whole or in part, through Washington's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government-by-proxy system.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In his speech to the NAE, DiIulio attempted to answer objections to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith-based fascism. To those who think it would corrupt their
</em><br>
organizations
<br>
<em>&gt; if they were to participate, his answer is simple: Don't participate.
</em><br>
Good
<br>
<em>&gt; advice, but worthless. Under fascism, non-participation is not an
</em><br>
option. We
<br>
<em>&gt; are compelled to pay taxes to support fascist government-by-proxy. We
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; compelled to obey the government's proxies. The freedom not to
</em><br>
participate
<br>
<em>&gt; should be extended to the collection of taxes, not just to the
</em><br>
distribution
<br>
<em>&gt; of stolen property that DiIulio calls federal funding. One slogan of
</em><br>
Italian
<br>
<em>&gt; Fascism was &quot;Everything within the State; nothing outside the State.&quot;
</em><br>
Our
<br>
<em>&gt; home-grown fascists operate on the same principle, working to expand a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political system that already penalizes those who oppose
</em><br>
institutionalized
<br>
<em>&gt; and legalized theft and rewards those who favor legalized theft. Their
</em><br>
goal
<br>
<em>&gt; is to politicize what remains of private charity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In an interesting remark to the NAE, DiIulio disclosed his
</em><br>
Antichristian
<br>
<em>&gt; view of the church: &quot;Community helpers and healers need and deserve
</em><br>
our
<br>
<em>&gt; individual and collective help. But they would need it less, much
</em><br>
less, if
<br>
<em>&gt; the church behaved like the church, unified from city to suburb..&quot;
</em><br>
These
<br>
<em>&gt; sentiments are Antichristian for at least two reasons. First, the
</em><br>
Christian
<br>
<em>&gt; church is not a social welfare organization. Anything it does to care
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; the physical welfare of people is incidental and subordinate to its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overriding purpose, the proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
</em><br>
The
<br>
<em>&gt; Christian Gospel is not the Social Gospel. Paul even gives us
</em><br>
instructions
<br>
<em>&gt; on who is not to helped - those who will not work and widows under age
</em><br>
60 -
<br>
<em>&gt; to name two groups. Second, the church is not supposed to be a
</em><br>
centralized
<br>
<em>&gt; institution. The churches in the New Testament are scattered over a
</em><br>
wide
<br>
<em>&gt; geographical area; there is no centralized administration, no
</em><br>
denominational
<br>
<em>&gt; apparatus, only congregations and an occasional presbytery meeting.
</em><br>
The
<br>
<em>&gt; churches' only visible links to each other are not organizational, but
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; apostles and evangelists. When the apostles die, there is no visible,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structural, or organizational link between the churches. Their unity
</em><br>
lies
<br>
<em>&gt; solely in &quot;one Lord, one faith, one baptism&quot;; Paul mentions nothing
</em><br>
about
<br>
<em>&gt; one denomination. There is no common organization. Of course, the
</em><br>
ambitious
<br>
<em>&gt; founders of DiIulio's Church-State, the bishops of Rome (not Jesus
</em><br>
Christ or
<br>
<em>&gt; Peter), seeking to supplant both the head of the church, Christ, and
</em><br>
his
<br>
<em>&gt; apostles, invented and asserted apostolic succession, claimed to be
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; vicars of Christ walking on Earth, and imposed their control on other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; churches. Two thousand years after Christ the bishops of Rome are
</em><br>
still
<br>
<em>&gt; seeking to impose their control on other churches. It is this
</em><br>
bureaucratic
<br>
<em>&gt; and totalitarian view of the church that DiIulio favors, and it is
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; Antichristian view of the church that compassionate fascism will
</em><br>
encourage,
<br>
<em>&gt; support, and if successful, impose. No wonder DiIulio says, &quot;our
</em><br>
hearts are
<br>
<em>&gt; joyous and light.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Nominally Reformed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Marvin Olasky, an adviser to President Bush pushing compassionate
</em><br>
fascism,
<br>
<em>&gt; is a member of the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), and a member
</em><br>
of the
<br>
<em>&gt; board of Covenant College. Dr. Amy Sherman, who started the Abundant
</em><br>
Life
<br>
<em>&gt; Family Center at Trinity Presbyterian Church (PCA) in Charlottesville,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Virginia, is now Urban Ministries Advisor there. That church already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receives government funding for its social programs, and it apparently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desires more. Dr. Sherman uses her position with The Hudson Institute
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; propagandize for faith-based fascism. Russ Pulliam, editor of the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bush should stand his ground in response to any legal threats to drag
</em><br>
his
<br>
<em>&gt; proposals into court. He has the First Amendment on his side, based on
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; strict constructionist reading of the Constitution.. Thomas Jefferson
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approved federal grants to Roman Catholic missions to the Indians.
</em><br>
Congress
<br>
<em>&gt; approved its own government-paid chaplain.. There is nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unconstitutional about a government grant for a rescue mission that
</em><br>
helps
<br>
<em>&gt; the homeless..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not only does President Bush have the Constitution, Thomas Jefferson,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; Congress on his side, according to Pulliam, he has Jesus Christ, the
</em><br>
Bible,
<br>
<em>&gt; and the Apostle Paul as well:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Romans 13, Paul explains how civil government is designed to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;minister of God to thee for good.&quot; The king of civil government,
</em><br>
after all,
<br>
<em>&gt; is Jesus Christ; so it should not be surprising that he can use that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government to help in the resolution of social problems, through
</em><br>
cooperation
<br>
<em>&gt; with ministries like Prison Fellowship.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pulliam is not alone; the Christian Statesman, a periodical published
</em><br>
by the
<br>
<em>&gt; National Reform Association, whose members are supposed to be
</em><br>
conservative
<br>
<em>&gt; Presbyterians with Reconstructionist proclivities, has expressed
</em><br>
similar
<br>
<em>&gt; views.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may come as a surprise to Pulliam and his friends that there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitutional warrant whatsoever for federal subsidies to rescue
</em><br>
missions.
<br>
<em>&gt; The arguments he uses - what Jefferson and Congress may or may not
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; done - beg the question: He ought to show that what they did was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitutional, rather than assume that the actions of Jefferson and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Congress are ipso facto constitutional. Pulliam, for example, should
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; quoted James Madison's February 27, 1811, veto message to Congress:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The appropriation of funds of the United States for the use and
</em><br>
support of
<br>
<em>&gt; religious societies [is] contrary to the article of the Constitution
</em><br>
which
<br>
<em>&gt; declares that Congress shall make no law respecting a religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establishment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore, there is no warrant in the Constitution for any federal
</em><br>
welfare
<br>
<em>&gt; program, let alone a welfare program for religious societies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pulliam's understanding of Scripture is no better, and perhaps worse,
</em><br>
than
<br>
<em>&gt; his understanding of the Constitution: If Jesus Christ is king of
</em><br>
civil
<br>
<em>&gt; government, and if it is therefore proper to use civil government to
</em><br>
&quot;help
<br>
<em>&gt; in the resolution of social problems,&quot; then it also follows that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proper to use government to help in the resolution of religious
</em><br>
problems.
<br>
<em>&gt; One good non sequitur deserves another. That is how totalitarianism
</em><br>
comes,
<br>
<em>&gt; step by illogical step.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The separation of church and state - a phrase that has been demonized
</em><br>
by the
<br>
<em>&gt; Religious Right for the past 20 years - is what has afforded and still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affords us some religious freedom in this country. The Roman
</em><br>
Church-State -
<br>
<em>&gt; indeed all pagan religions - has always been opposed to the separation
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; church and state, and it remains so today. Now it has millions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative dupes singing its siren song of partnership between
</em><br>
church and
<br>
<em>&gt; state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Faith-based fascism will increase the size and scope of the federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government, extending it to organizations that have hitherto been
</em><br>
outside
<br>
<em>&gt; the state. That is the explicit goal of the policy, as expressed by
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; President himself. &quot;Everything within the State; nothing outside the
</em><br>
State.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Faith-based fascism will increase, not decrease, the constituencies of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; welfare state, creating new special interest groups, government-funded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious organizations, that will pressure officials to grant them
</em><br>
more
<br>
<em>&gt; money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Faith-based fascism is based on a political delusion. John DiIulio and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President Bush tell us that federal grants will be awarded and
</em><br>
withdrawn on
<br>
<em>&gt; the basis of results. DiIulio asserts: &quot;Opening competition for
</em><br>
federal
<br>
<em>&gt; funds to all, including tiny local faith-based organizations, could
</em><br>
usher in
<br>
<em>&gt; a new era of results-driven public administration. Scores of federal
</em><br>
welfare
<br>
<em>&gt; programs could be cured or killed.&quot; For someone who has co-authored a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; textbook on American government, DiIulio shows little understanding of
</em><br>
how
<br>
<em>&gt; government actually works. Government-grant awards and denials are
</em><br>
decided
<br>
<em>&gt; by political clout, political cronyism, and political biases. With the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addition of government grants to faith-based organizations, we must
</em><br>
add
<br>
<em>&gt; religious clout, religious cronyism, and religious biases. Tax funds
</em><br>
will
<br>
<em>&gt; flow to political and religious friends and be withheld from political
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; religious foes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Faith-based fascism, therefore, will affect which religious societies
</em><br>
will
<br>
<em>&gt; grow and which will not. Those with federally funded programs will
</em><br>
attract
<br>
<em>&gt; members; those who obey the Bible and the Constitution will be pushed
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt; the public square, marginalized, criticized, and persecuted by the
</em><br>
&quot;armies
<br>
<em>&gt; of compassion.&quot; Richard John Neuhaus' &quot;naked public square&quot; will once
</em><br>
again
<br>
<em>&gt; be filled with praying, autodafeing fascists, just like in the good
</em><br>
old
<br>
<em>&gt; days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How should a Christian respond to the President's baiting questions,
</em><br>
&quot;Do the
<br>
<em>&gt; critics really want them [Catholic Charities] cut off [from federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding]? Medicaid and Medicare money currently goes to religious
</em><br>
hospitals.
<br>
<em>&gt; Should this practice be ended? Child care vouchers for low income
</em><br>
families
<br>
<em>&gt; are redeemed every day at houses of worship across America. Should
</em><br>
this be
<br>
<em>&gt; prevented? Government loans send countless students to religious
</em><br>
colleges.
<br>
<em>&gt; Should that be banned?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The President answers, &quot;Of course not.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Christian answers, Yes, and the sooner the better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; End the student loans; they are funded by money stolen from taxpayers;
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; have driven the cost of a college education out of sight; and they are
</em><br>
used
<br>
<em>&gt; to put young people deeply into debt at the start of their lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; End the child care vouchers; they are funded by money stolen from
</em><br>
taxpayers,
<br>
<em>&gt; and they are used to put children into 9-to-5 orphanages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; End the subsidies for medical care; they are funded with money stolen
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt; taxpayers; they have raised the price of medical care to exorbitant
</em><br>
levels;
<br>
<em>&gt; they have encouraged people not to provide for their own; and they
</em><br>
have made
<br>
<em>&gt; government an idol.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; End the subsidies to Catholic Charities and World Vision; they are
</em><br>
funded
<br>
<em>&gt; with money stolen from taxpayers. If those charities were half as
</em><br>
wonderful
<br>
<em>&gt; as they tell us, their efforts would attract adequate voluntary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributions. The fact that these charities must rely on funds
</em><br>
obtained by
<br>
<em>&gt; force suggests that their programs are less than worthwhile, less than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient, or less than beneficial.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And let's be clear about charity. Charity is not compelling someone
</em><br>
else to
<br>
<em>&gt; give his money to the poor. It is giving one's own money away; it is
</em><br>
freely
<br>
<em>&gt; contributing one's own time. Government charity is a contradiction in
</em><br>
terms,
<br>
<em>&gt; for government has no money except what it collects by force from
</em><br>
others.
<br>
<em>&gt; What President Bush proposes is not greater charity, but aggravated
</em><br>
theft
<br>
<em>&gt; and increased compulsion. There is nothing Christian or charitable
</em><br>
about it.
<br>
<em>&gt; It is a violation of the Ten Commandments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This writer has heard no &quot;Christian&quot; leader give the correct answers
</em><br>
to the
<br>
<em>&gt; President's questions. They have already agreed in principle with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President's faith-based fascism. Long ago they abandoned the whole
</em><br>
counsel
<br>
<em>&gt; of God, choosing which Biblical doctrines they would believe and
</em><br>
teach, and
<br>
<em>&gt; which they would ignore. Many of them have abandoned the Gospel of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substitutionary death of Christ for his people and justification by
</em><br>
faith
<br>
<em>&gt; alone. Now they have denied what the Scriptures teach on private
</em><br>
property,
<br>
<em>&gt; the role of government, and the social order.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The salt has lost its savor; it has become worthless; and it deserves
</em><br>
to be
<br>
<em>&gt; trodden underfoot by men.

&gt; 1. For a more accurate view of the Roman Catholic treatment of
marriage and
&gt; the family, see Sheila Rauch Kennedy, Shattered Faith: A Woman's
Struggle to
&gt; Stop the Catholic Church from Annulling Her Marriage. It is outrageous
that
&gt; two institutions that have sinful views of marriage and the family -
the
&gt; Roman Church-State and the Mormon Church - now enjoy reputations as
&gt; defenders of the family.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  President Bush is not the first convert, but he seems to be more
&gt; enthusiastic about the religion than some others. Last year, under
pressure
&gt; from the Vatican, Republican Congressional leaders dropped their
opposition
&gt; to a Clinton administration proposal to forgive the debts of 30 poor
&gt; countries. President Clinton made the proposal a week after John Paul
II
&gt; called for government forgiveness of debts during 2000, a &quot;Jubilee
Year.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Relativist tolerance is always disguised intolerance. When asked
during
&gt; the campaign if he would support federal funding of the Nation of
Islam,
&gt; Bush replied, &quot;I don't see how we can allow public dollars to fund
programs
&gt; where spite and hate is the core of the message.&quot; But the Nation of
Islam
&gt; had produced results: It is reputed to be very effective at dealing
with
&gt; drug abuse and crime problems; in fact, in the early 1990s, the
Department
&gt; of Housing and Urban Development had contracted with the Nation of
Islam to
&gt; provide security in public housing projects. Under pluralism, all
religions
&gt; are equal, but some are more equal than others.
