<p>
I haven't read this thread completely yet and will probably
<br>
say something that has already been said, so apologies in
<br>
advance.
<br>
<p>Charlie Stross said:
<br>
<em>&gt; The root of this social problem is that the marginal value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of money declines as you acquire more.
</em><br>
<p>This is a good observation.  Certainly there are many a year
<br>
when the Jacks/Bills/Larrys of the world make enough that
<br>
they never have to work again a day in their lives.
<br>
(Though they are already wealthy enough that they don't
<br>
have to work another day in their lives).
<br>
<p>Given this situation, you are in a very uncommon area
<br>
of the risk-benefit tradeoff.  You can replace a dozen
<br>
or a thousand corporate employees and depending on the
<br>
size of the company not change its market valuation at all.
<br>
On the other hand if you replace the CEO you will raise
<br>
all kinds of confidence issues for investors.  Does the
<br>
replacement know the business?  Are they as astute or
<br>
aggressive as the individual being replaced?  etc. etc.
<br>
<p>So, as one becomes wealthier the likelyhood of the
<br>
executive saying &quot;take this job and shove it&quot; increases.
<br>
So compensation committees have to pay increasingly
<br>
larger amounts to preserve the existing value the
<br>
investors have because they run a high risk of the
<br>
executive leaving causing the company to be perceived
<br>
as an &quot;uncertain&quot; risk, causing significant losses
<br>
in valuation.
<br>
<p>Its a form of extortion in a way.  Executive says -
<br>
&quot;you will lose this much valuation if I leave&quot;.
<br>
Compensation committee says &quot;ok, we will pay you 1/10th
<br>
of that&quot;.  Only if the performance of the company
<br>
is really poor does the compensation committee get
<br>
to pull the strings a little.  Then an executive
<br>
change can look like a good thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By giving the workers more money to spend, in the broader picture,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bosses can expand the overall size of the market (and ultimately reap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bigger long term rewards).
</em><br>
<p>I'd say this is incorrect.  Any economist will tell you
<br>
that present-day consumption borrows from future growth
<br>
rates.  If Jack Welch earns $122 million where does it go?
<br>
After 30-40% to the government, most of it probably goes
<br>
into risk capital.  I.e. into those funds providing the
<br>
money Charlie would like to get from the VCs.  Risky
<br>
investments, but big payoffs.  Jack gets richer and if
<br>
Charlie's strategy works out he gets to join the Jack's
<br>
ranks.  On the other hand if you instead redirect the
<br>
money to the worker, who then proceeds to use it to buy
<br>
&quot;Pet Rocks&quot;, there is relatively little job creation
<br>
(providing jobs for people who would otherwise not
<br>
have them), or making the economy more productive
<br>
(by fostering inventions that increase efficiency).
<br>
<p>I cannot find merit in this thread (so far) because it fails to
<br>
account for the multiplier effect(s) of the allocation of
<br>
income by an &quot;average&quot; person compared with the multiplier
<br>
effect(s) of the allocation of income by a &quot;wealthy&quot; person.
<br>
<p>Now, if someone were to make the case that a majority of
<br>
wealthy (or highly compensated) executives spend a majority
<br>
of their wealth in non-productive ways -- then I would have to
<br>
sit back and rethink my position.
<br>
