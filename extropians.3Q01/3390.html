<p>Another reason to junk philosophy, if you can separate it into regions.
<br>
Is there an European vs. American astrophysics?

<p>There are appeals to the ratio, and then, there's PR.

<p><em>&gt; change how people are or will people have to do that for themselves?
</em><br>
<p>I think directing your own change is much preferrable to being shaped by
<br>
others, especially without your consent, or simply going extinct by virtue
<br>
of resisting change. (They don't like it? They can kiss my furry little
<br>
butt).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The degree of optimism on this list concerning the future is

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Broderick envisions but People have milked the meme concerning the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power of science to improve the human condition to death.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree with that statement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The egg heads (no offense intended) have been saying that technology
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Technology has indeed developed the cures for many diseases and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased crop harvests etc. but most people don't get the benefit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree with that statement either. Well, okay, you've got a
<br>
marginal point. We've got a planning, deployment and education problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Will what most people get out of a time and technology that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce diamond houses cheaply be a diamond bullet in the head? If not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why?
</em><br>
<p>Huh?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Will Transhumanism become a sort of super technocratic society in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which technologists develop technology only for themselves or can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others join? Will it be the third word that matches: aristocracy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racism.......... transhumanism?
</em><br>
<p>Everyone can participate in R&amp;D of transhumanist relevance. Some of said
<br>
R&amp;D is explicitly directed towards access to information easy, cheap, and
<br>
ubiquitous. Provided, people are willing, and the didactical part is
<br>
addressed. It will be interesting to see how the Simputer experiment will
<br>
fare.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; After all this biotech superman thing is basically a child of National
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Socialism. Sure, now one can in theory claim that with gene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulation even defectives CAN be healed. WILL they be healed?
</em><br>
<p>Heilt Hitler, then. And please no 'gene manipulation, he hates that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are the words can and should synonyms?
</em><br>
<p>Is there a particular reason why you must wax rhetorical on us?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Over the time (years) that I have been a member of this list I have,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from time to time, noticed what I (perhaps wrongly) interpret to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disdain for poor/uneducated/less intelligent people in many postings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so I wonder  Will everybody get a better body or will there be a races
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of super humans and slave race that serve them?
</em><br>
<p>How do you serve a god? You don't. You can't. There's nothing you can
<br>
offer a god. So serve yourself, and become a god. It makes things much
<br>
easier for everybody.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is to stop Transhumanism from becoming the scientific arm of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future dictatorships?
</em><br>
<p>Educating people about risks of certain technologies, and necessity to
<br>
keep current. It helps to be persuasive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can Libertarianism be summed up like this: all the freedom, justice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health and life that money can buy. If so how does that change things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the way they are now?
</em><br>
<p>Have fun erecting your straw men.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is or will Transhumanism be nothing more than intellectual confusion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral imbecility, and willful ugliness elaborated into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-conscious ideology: the worship of wealth, power, novelty and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machinery? Will it become the ultimate expression of what many call a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture less and materialist America: a sort of burger and coke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion?
</em><br>
<p>You're making it sound as if we had a choice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Must Transhumanism demand spiritual pathology. Obviously not since Mr.
</em><br>
<p>Hey! Some of us are naturally weird, and like it that way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Broderick seems to allow for something else, as it were, but how many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumans can make allowances for that which they cannot see?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For me the ends justify the means but it seems that in Transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the means is the end. Is this a fair judgment?
</em><br>
<p>More puzzlement ensues. I think J.R.'s condition is catching.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are those who say that Libertarians and individualists are most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to be solely concerned with their own egotistical and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Narcissistic gratification. Since there are a few here on the list I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask would you refute this claim and how/why?
</em><br>
<p>There's a difference between stupidly selfish, and rationally selfish.
<br>
Being dumb hurts you, and others, so don't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How would a Transhumanist egalitarian/collectivist effort express
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself? Would they go for a Borg type society as in Star Trekk?
</em><br>
<p>I expect diversity. I hope reality will do me a favour, and concur.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why not find ways of extending the use of our already existing brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of making new ones? If the mind can work outside of the human
</em><br>
<p>It is rather difficult trying to patch a system which is falling apart
<br>
before your eyes, and has not been designed to be patchable with the
<br>
current flavour of tech. So, at some point a redesign is in order.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; body why go for any form of containment at all? Is it possible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist without limits?
</em><br>
<p>No idea. What was the critical angel density ceilidh on a pin, again?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since our instincts and emotions are our driving forces if we insulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves from them or get rid of them what will our motivating force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be?
</em><br>
<p>Hey! Hands off from my limbic system. One of them &quot;like&quot; things happens to
<br>
&quot;like&quot; &quot;like&quot;, like.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are people in general in greater danger of being mistreated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumans/extropians than, white people are of being mistreated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negroes?
</em><br>
<p>It is not smart to delibertely shun power, when it is being thrust your
<br>
way. Somebody is not going to refuse. Will you bet that that somebody is
<br>
nice, in your sense?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In attempting to become more than human will we become less?
</em><br>
<p>Who cares.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Don't get me wrong. I'm not against science and technology. I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; install a bionic leg today if I could -_-  It's just that I have lived
</em><br>
<p>A bionic leg? Only if it's superior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; a lot of my life in what you would call primitive circumstances and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have taken a long time to learn about all the different stuff you guys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk about here.
</em><br>
<p>What do you call primitive circumstances? Inquiring minds want to know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In reading up I have found questions which have bothered me but I did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not want to trouble you all with my lack of knowledge/understanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However since some people on this list seriously wanted to discuss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether or not white people are nicer than black people I figured that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my questions won't be the most stupid ever brought up on the list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, as the progress of technology fuels its own acceleration and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rushes us into the future at exponential speed will we vanish up our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own anuses?
</em><br>
<p>Also an event horizont, of sorts.
