<em>&gt;&gt;Just out of curiosity, I'm wondering how many on this list feel they came up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;with the idea of the singularity on their own. I feel like I did, and was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;surprised to find an organization based, in large part, on the concept.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is nothing new under the sun (I may not have been the first to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this). Transhumanism is a minor variant on an ancient theme. Plato and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aristotle said the (1) telos of humanity's best (i.e., philosophers) is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become godlike, (2) that we ought to become godlike, and (3) that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dialectical reasoning is the means for philosophers to realize their telos.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unlike Plato and Aristotle (Hegel, etc.) we do not believe that there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little divine element in us that needs to be nurtured. Darwin killed that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea forever. So, transhumanists substitute technology (most notably genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering and AI) for (3). What separates us from Plato et al is a minor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quibble about the means to become what we ought to be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, but I respectfully and completely disagree. Our current concept
<br>
of the singularity is grounded in science, not philosophy. It is a
<br>
simple forward extrapolation of well-understood phenomena.
<br>
<p>The concept that &quot;we are simply re-discovering things that the ancients
<br>
already knew&quot; became progressively less tenable throughout the
<br>
renaissance, and is now essentially invalid. It's true that modern
<br>
disciplines have ancient analogs when described qualitatively, but
<br>
this is basically coincidence. The ancients displayed brilliance,
<br>
but they did not have the tools, methods or results of modern
<br>
science, so their theories were not deeply grounded enough to be
<br>
more than superficially predictive.
