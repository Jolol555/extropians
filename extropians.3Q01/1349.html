</em><br>
<p>This is something I just don't understand at all.  What do you mean, I
<br>
can't do this in XML?  I can do this with raw lists but not with XML?  Why
<br>
on Earth not?  When I was young and inexperienced I wrote my own
<br>
parser-interpreter on at least two occasions, and I can personally attest
<br>
that it is both easy and natural to represent code blocks and expressions
<br>
as tree structures which are then directly executed by the interpreter. 
<br>
Not supernaturally efficient, perhaps, but not too slow either.
<br>
<p>In fact, I believe that LISP code effectively does this as well; LISP
<br>
expressions may not be *extensible* tree structures (if you can cons
<br>
another element onto '(plus 2 2) without breaking it, even under
<br>
object-oriented Common LISP, I'd like to know how), but LISP expressions
<br>
are most certainly tree structures and not Java VM or assembly.  '(plus 2
<br>
(plus 1 1)) sure looks like a tree structure to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Bah.  I can annotate much more richly in Lisp
</em><br>
<p>??
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annotation adapt itself to the context dynamically to boot.
</em><br>
<p>Funny, I don't remember that idiom being built into lists.  What's that
<br>
you say?  It's built into the language interpreter, not the
<br>
representation?  Well, why wouldn't Flare be able to do that as well?  And
<br>
do it far more naturally with XML than with lists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is hierarchical.  This is not a great thing for a programming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language.  There are many other very useful relationships of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elements as I am sure you are aware.  Using a tool that only has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of them built-in and the rest as relatively ugly kludges is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of the problem I have with using XML as a programming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language.  It is even somewhat of a problem even using it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represent relatively (to XML) rich data relationships.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see why Flare would have trouble representing non-hierarchical
<br>
data.  Flare has references, so it can freely represent directed networks
<br>
and cyclic structures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Readying XML files is not a natural human capability.  I find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them painfully stultified for all but data that happens to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty hierarchical.  It does not make sense to me that pushing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things into XML is more powerful than something truly flexible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for representing and building new kinds of relationships and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithms like lisp.  And Lisp is much easier to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmatically read and manipulate than using XML.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, this is new.  LISP would be superior to Flare?  I have to admit that
<br>
I've never heard that one before.
<br>
<p>Lists are only the foundation of LISP.  There's ever so much more to the
<br>
language.  This I know.  But LISP is still ultimately built on the idiom
<br>
of lists.  There's more to Flare than XML, but Flare is still ultimately
<br>
built on that foundation.  And XML is a better foundation than lists,
<br>
because you can add new pieces of data without destroying the integrity of
<br>
existing data.  With a list, it takes work to enable annotation as a
<br>
special case; with XML, it is universal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Translating from FlareSpeak to FlareCode (read something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable for expressing algorithms to XML which is arguable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not at all reasonable for this) and back again costs machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cycles
</em><br>
<p>FlareSpeak never even exists except when a human programmer is looking at
<br>
code.  It is inelegant to ever write FlareSpeak to disk unless it is for
<br>
debugging purposes.
<br>
<p>FlareCode's tree structure, I expect, will be directly executed by the
<br>
interpreter.  Possibly there will later be optimized representations of
<br>
FlareCode; but, like I said, I can personally attest that it is possible,
<br>
and in fact very natural, to build an interpreter that represents
<br>
statements and expressions as tree structures, and LISP seems to get along
<br>
fine by doing so.
