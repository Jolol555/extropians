<em>&gt;This is a very ambitious study, combining a climate model with an economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;model.  I can't help being skeptical about whether the researchers have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bitten off more than they can chew.
</em><br>
<p>Wow.  An extropian complaining that an elaborate analysis of the future
<br>
just still isn't detailed enough to inform our choices.  :-)  Of course
<br>
by this standard virtually no extropian analysis is good enough either.
<br>
We have no models of anywhere near this detail for the social implications
<br>
of nanotech, AI, uploads, space colonization, etc, which are subjects of
<br>
constant discussion here.  My attitude is to draw tentative conclusions
<br>
from whatever is the best analysis in an area.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;..  Nordhaus ... &quot;three
</em><br>
<em>&gt;box&quot; model (atmosphere, biosphere, ocean) is much simpler than the full
</em><br>
<em>&gt;models being run.  He says that he gets about the same results, but if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so then that would suggest that the more complex models aren't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessary, wouldn't it?
</em><br>
<p>No, a more complex model can *validate* a simpler one.  If I show you a
<br>
simple model of a ball bouncing and you complain that it doesn't take
<br>
into account air friction, if I then show that you get pretty much the
<br>
same results with a more complex model, that allows me to get away with
<br>
the simpler model in future discussions.  I don't have to always use the
<br>
most complex possible model.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;His economic model seems even more questionable.  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;... But how much credibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does a model have which assumes only one commodity, no significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;international trade, and that technology and population growth are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;independent of economic activity? ...
</em><br>
<p>Lots of credibility.  But as usual, you have to have some expertize
<br>
in an area like this in order to judge what sort of approximations
<br>
in a model are reasonable.  I'm nowhere as expert as Nordhaus on
<br>
this, but I know enough to see why these are reasonable
<br>
approximations for his purposes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;TFP growth is assumed to slow gradually over the next three
</em><br>
<em>&gt;centuries until eventually stopping. ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For those interested in pursuing it, his model is available for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;download as an Excel spreadsheet.  It would be interesting to plug in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some more aggressive growth scenarios and see if it alters his results
</em><br>
<em>&gt;qualitatively.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, as usual the effective way to challenge one model is with
<br>
another model.
