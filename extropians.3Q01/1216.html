<em>&gt;&gt; Why the focus on a land invasion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't believe I did.
</em><br>
<p>Your question:  &quot;What would it have to do with defending your land against
<br>
an enemy army? Zilch.&quot; shows otherwise.
<br>
<p>You earlier arguments seemed to be that we should be against the current ABM
<br>
program because:
<br>
<p>a) it won't stop a land army,
<br>
b) it won't stop a massive strike -- e.g., the Russians launching everything
<br>
they've got,
<br>
c) it will provoke another nuclear arms buildup, making the previous
<br>
[massive strike] more likely, and
<br>
d) it doesn't work.
<br>
<p>To this we can add:
<br>
<p>e) it won't stop a nonmissile nuclear attack -- e.g., a suitcase bomb or
<br>
something along those lines.
<br>
<p>More below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Defensive technology was doing fine until about 1918
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Castles and forts stopped being important long before then.
</em><br>
<p>Castles did.  Forts did.  Trenches did not.  Certainly the Allies and the
<br>
Entente had a hard time penetrating each others defenses between 1915 and
<br>
1918.  This doesn't matter as much to the ABM discussion.  I was just trying
<br>
to show that offensive and defensive technology are both a bit more dynamic
<br>
then the version of history you gave.
<br>
<p>That said, there's no a priori reason to think defensive technology has
<br>
somehow been permanently routed.
<br>
<p>Getting back to &quot;d&quot; above -- &quot;it doesn't work&quot; -- does this foreclose on it
<br>
ever working?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;If, e.g., Iraq or Serbia had the US level of  technological and military
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;development would the recent wars with them have turned out the same?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course not, and we would have been fools to start a war with such a
</em><br>
country.
<br>
<p>My point: it was not so much offensive technologies that won these
<br>
conflicts, but lack of adequate defensive technologies.  See, e.g., Stephen
<br>
Biddle's &quot;Victory Misunderstood: What the Gulf War Tells Us about the Future
<br>
of Conflict&quot; in _International Security_ 21:2 (Fall 1996), 139-179.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the cold war people said we don't have to worry about a suitcase H bomb
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt; Russia because the Russians haven't invented the suitcase yet. It was a
</em><br>
joke, and
<br>
<em>&gt; so are the reasons I've heard to justify Star Wars. If North Korea wanted
</em><br>
to kill us
<br>
<em>&gt; and they had The Bomb why on earth would they send it to us with a ICBM
</em><br>
and not a
<br>
<em>&gt; UPS? An ICBM is expensive, harder to make than The Bomb and everybody
</em><br>
knows
<br>
<em>&gt; where it was launched from. UPS is cheap, easy, and nobody will know where
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; came from, all they'll know is that Seattle no longer exists.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with you here, but this is not the scenario which the current ABM
<br>
work is built to handle.  Disengagement would still be the best policy.
<br>
Again, I don't support the ABM program per se.  I just don't think your
<br>
other arguments against it are cogent.  (See above.)
<br>
<p>You have to also ask yourself, why North Korea -- the archetypal rogue state
<br>
in most public discourse -- is building long range missle technology.  I
<br>
think it has more to do with having a threat than using it, but that's my
<br>
guess.  I'm not inside their leader's head.
<br>
<p>Also, I do think it might be a bit easier to build missile technology and do
<br>
it openly.  A lot of the components for it are easier to develop and obtain.
<br>
Part of this has to do with the weapons control regime in existence right
<br>
now.  The main focus of it is to stop proliferation of nuclear weapons.
<br>
Missile technology is also on the list, but the detection and monitoring
<br>
capabilities are a bit different.  After all, short range missle technology
<br>
is not banned.  (This would be equivalent in the area of nukes to banning
<br>
H-bombs, but not A-bombs.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
