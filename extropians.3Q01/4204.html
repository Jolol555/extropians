<em>&gt;A new model of economic fluctuations suggests that a global recession is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indeed imminent - probably worse than that of 1990-91 - and that forecasters
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should have spotted it a year ago1.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Depressions in the US economy become a near-inevitability at least a year
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before they happen, says Elliott Middleton of Placemark Investments in Dallas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Texas. His model predicts, a year in advance, all five of the slumps between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1969 and 1998, and generates no false alarms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;With this track record, the model's forecast of a recession in the second half
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of 2001 seems worth taking very seriously. Last May, professional economists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;put the chance of such a slump at about one in three; now many businesses are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bracing themselves for it. Middleton expects the coming recession to be less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;serious than those of the 1970s and 1980s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Slumps seem to be an inevitable aspect of any economy; the business cycle of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;boom and bust has become a standard part of economic lore. But these changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are not really cyclic at all. Although bad times inevitably follow good, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is no regularity to the rise and fall of the economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This makes recessions embarrassingly hard for economists to predict. In the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;words of John Kay of the London Business School: &quot;Economic forecasters all say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more or less the same thing at the same time, but what they say is almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;always wrong.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Middleton believes that there is something of a self-fulfilling prophecy about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recessions. Businesses and investors lose confidence in the buoyancy of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;market; their timidity causes a slowing and eventually a turnaround of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economic growth. The British economist John Maynard Keynes dubbed these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subjective levels of market confidence 'animal spirits'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Nothing, it seems, deflates these spirits like unemployment. The moment the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unemployment rate ceases to improve, confidence plummets and the economy heads
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for a turnaround, transforming a boom into a slump. Because unemployment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;levels cannot get better for ever, a boom, in effect, carries the seed of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;own demise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Loss of confidence can be detected in the variations of an economic index
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before the slump itself takes hold, Middleton says. Crucially, he asserts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;market agents are adaptive: they take their norms from recent events rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than from any absolute judgement about what is a good or bad unemployment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So Middleton's model derives confidence changes from adaptive changes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unemployment, and uses the resulting prediction to forecast slumps.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For the post-war US economy, the model works well. But in other countries -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where the memory of the 1930s' Great Depression is less haunting -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unemployment might not be the main influence on confidence levels, Middleton
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cautions. This might explain why previous attempts at forecasting have met
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with varying success in different countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

</em><br>
<p><p>Yeah, but how does he MEASURE his quantifications/variables, or what
<br>
are they based on? He's not  really saying, I don't think.  I
<br>
basically agree with him that finance is based on confidence. I wrote
<br>
a perl script a few months ago to try to measure/relate the stock
<br>
market to negative words in financial news stories.  Then I graduated
<br>
and got a job and haven't had time to look at the long term effects...
