<p><p>DUBYA AND ME: WE'VE GOT NO IDEA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That clueless stare in George W.'s eyes?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole generation of graying 'wise' guys
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know all about it.
<br>
<p><p>by Ian Frazier May/June 2001
<br>
<p><p><p>Whenever George W. Bush opened his mouth in public during last year's 
<br>
presidential campaign, a thrill ran through observers all across the 
<br>
country and beyond. The thrill -- not pleasant, but exciting 
<br>
nonetheless -- was the thrill that comes over us in the presence of a 
<br>
person who does not know what he is doing. Electronically present to 
<br>
more or less the whole world, Bush kept everybody in a state of 
<br>
fearful uncertainty and expectation. Sometimes the feeling was so 
<br>
strong that it began to grow even before he spoke. Before the 
<br>
presidential debates, people were wondering if he would make it 
<br>
through without some fatal blunder. At every slight fumble or 
<br>
mispronunciation, we held the arms of our chairs: Would this be the 
<br>
one that finally revealed how utterly at sea the man was? Watching a 
<br>
person fake it is so nerve-wracking that I believe whenever he got 
<br>
through these ordeals halfway okay, even his enemies were secretly 
<br>
relieved.
<br>
<p>In former times, that particular thrill was often aroused by his 
<br>
father's vice president, Dan Quayle. Looking into Quayle's eyes on 
<br>
the TV screen when he had no idea of the answer to a question he'd 
<br>
just been asked -- what a spine-tingling experience that was! To 
<br>
glimpse the cluelessness in those eyes! For an instant we were up 
<br>
there with him, in the common nightmare: The audience looks at us in 
<br>
anticipation, but we have lost our speech, forgotten our lines, and 
<br>
improvidently dressed in only our underwear. The Dan Quayle 
<br>
deer-in-headlights clueless stare proved a bit too scary to be 
<br>
exciting, finally. Part of what George W. Bush offered was the old 
<br>
Dan Quayle frisson , but in a less concentrated, commercially 
<br>
acceptable form.
<br>
<p>I am a few years younger, but I belong to the same generation as W. 
<br>
Bush and Quayle. I know how many classes we skipped, how much we 
<br>
partied, how much TV we watched. (What great work, I wonder, do those 
<br>
many hours of &quot;Baretta&quot; and &quot;Hee Haw&quot; prepare you for?) I have a 
<br>
generational sense of the vacancy in their stare, because I share it. 
<br>
I myself don't know what I am doing a good forty percent of the time. 
<br>
I am now the kind of white-haired, thick-waisted, superficially 
<br>
presentable male who people give huge responsibility to and ask 
<br>
directions of on the street. And often, I'm just making it up. The 
<br>
situation is one I've become quite familiar with -- I'm asked a 
<br>
question, no answer presents itself in my brain, and I begin to 
<br>
answer anyway. My mouth moves and words come out, propelled perhaps 
<br>
by pure syntax or by the momentum of the language, while I watch from 
<br>
a distance, as curious as anybody to hear what I'm going to say. And 
<br>
somehow words do emerge, and my listeners accept them as an answer 
<br>
representing thought and knowledge, and I alone, apparently, know 
<br>
that no thought or knowledge was involved.
<br>
<p>I go into a fancy wine store and buy a good bottle of wine. I stop by 
<br>
the bank and listen to a lady there tell about interest points on my 
<br>
home loan. I see the guy who does my taxes and I have a conversation 
<br>
about the new tax laws. I run into a health-conscious friend who 
<br>
discusses some kind of fatty acid and what it could do for me. I go 
<br>
home and answer a homework question from my son having to do with the 
<br>
surface tension of water. I sit down to dinner and talk to my wife 
<br>
about the purchase of some bathroom tile. At no point during any of 
<br>
these encounters do I have more than the vaguest idea of what I am 
<br>
talking about. Nor do I understand in any clear way what is being 
<br>
said to me; instead I listen to the general sound of the sentences, 
<br>
hoping no one has noticed that I am actually lying down someplace in 
<br>
the back of my head, leafing through an old copy of a magazine. And 
<br>
if, God forbid, I actually have to do something -- make a decision, 
<br>
provide real information -- I close my eyes and just guess.
<br>
<p>I won't describe the messes this gets me into. With my almost-teenage 
<br>
daughter, I have agreed to complicated plans that later caused me to 
<br>
curse and fume when I discovered what they actually were. But these 
<br>
are personal disasters, probably of no danger to the public at large. 
<br>
Anybody who watches TV or movies knows that Dad will always be an 
<br>
idiot; but what if Dad is the president? Cluelessness multiplied by 
<br>
power is what puts the secret message of dizzying terror in W. Bush's 
<br>
eyes. (Recently, of course, he has kept to his script and hasn't 
<br>
shown the clueless stare; to see him hiding it only scares me more.)
<br>
<p>And if I don't know what I'm doing and W. Bush doesn't know what he's 
<br>
doing, what does that say for the human species as a whole? Clearly, 
<br>
a lot of human history must have been the result of major world 
<br>
figures drawing a total blank at key moments and simply blurting out 
<br>
the first thing that came to mind. Big events as well as small have 
<br>
turned on a neurological roll of the dice. Thomas Jefferson, for 
<br>
example, seems to have improvised a lot more than the textbooks would 
<br>
have us believe. A friend of mine who teaches a college course on 
<br>
Jefferson has examined his famous &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
<br>
happiness&quot; statement from the Declaration of Independence, and she 
<br>
concludes that he planned the &quot;life, liberty&quot; part beforehand, but 
<br>
&quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot; part he merely added on the spot to round 
<br>
out the phrase, a flourish at the end. Jefferson himself, she 
<br>
believes, had no intention of mentioning &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot; 
<br>
until he saw the words flowing from his pen. It may be that for 225 
<br>
years now we've been trying to live up to a founding concept of our 
<br>
country that was thrown in at the last minute because it sounded nice 
<br>
and the author couldn't think what else to say. That it happened to 
<br>
be a phrase of poetry and genius was one of the best breaks America 
<br>
ever had.
<br>
<p>People who don't know what they're doing often get by on their 
<br>
supposed freshness and spontaneity. Indeed, the idea of the New, so 
<br>
central to our lives, sets us up for this trick all the time. To 
<br>
devotees of the New, incompetence and unpreparedness are actually 
<br>
good; what we want is a mind uncluttered by previous experience. As a 
<br>
writer, I sometimes get calls from magazine editors who ask me to 
<br>
write articles on subjects about which I am completely uninformed. 
<br>
When I admit my ignorance, the editors always say that's exactly what 
<br>
they're looking for, because someone who understands the subject 
<br>
can't see it with fresh eyes, and it's actually far better that I 
<br>
know nothing, and so on. Usually I don't take these assignments, but 
<br>
once in a while I do. I've noticed that when I submit the article, 
<br>
the editors never say, &quot;Wow! I loved it! You had no idea what you 
<br>
were talking about at all!&quot;
<br>
<p>When people believe they're creating the New, they even make a virtue 
<br>
of not knowing what they're doing. And now that everything is new all 
<br>
the time, the most thorough kinds of ignorance are accepted as 
<br>
routine. Not long ago I came across a hint of how this bizarre system 
<br>
first began. It's in the Bible, in the Book of Matthew, just a few 
<br>
pages into the New Testament. Jesus is telling the disciples how they 
<br>
should travel about the land preaching, and he says they should not 
<br>
carry money or supplies or extra clothes, because all will be 
<br>
provided for them as they go; and if they are brought before 
<br>
officials to explain themselves, he says, &quot;Take no thought how or 
<br>
what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what 
<br>
ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your 
<br>
Father.&quot;
<br>
<p>I can sympathize with someone trying to start a new religion and not 
<br>
wanting to get tangled up in the details. You want your disciples to 
<br>
go out there and preach, instead of wasting time on travel plans. But 
<br>
telling them not to bother making some notes beforehand about what 
<br>
they're going to say... that's irresponsible, it seems to me. Imagine 
<br>
the millions of hours of dreadful sermons that particular advice has 
<br>
spawned!
<br>
<p>Once on an airplane I happened to sit in front of two preachers -- 
<br>
Southern evangelicals, on their way to seek souls in Russia -- and I 
<br>
heard one say to the other, &quot;I didn't have a sermon prepared, so I 
<br>
just stood up there and started ramble-preaching.&quot; Ramble-preaching 
<br>
-- they even have a term for it! I have sat through many hours of 
<br>
ramble-preaching, in church and not, and it's an ordeal I cannot 
<br>
bear. The moment I realize the minister is just making it up as he 
<br>
goes along is the moment I look for the door. I feel the same about 
<br>
onstage improvisation of any kind. Please, performers, let's not just 
<br>
see what pops into your head. Give me a wooden, pre-scripted speaker 
<br>
any day.
<br>
<p>So, naturally, in the presidential race I was for Gore. I loved how 
<br>
stiff and prepped and pat he was. Even the makeup I didn't mind. I 
<br>
found the whole Gore approach wonderfully un-spontaneous and restful. 
<br>
As I so often do, when he spoke I listened to the sound rather than 
<br>
the meaning while drifting in a pleasant reverie. Then suddenly on 
<br>
the TV screen W. Bush would appear. Somehow I could never avoid 
<br>
looking into those frightened, terrifying eyes. It was as if there 
<br>
were swirly spirals going into them like in a science fiction movie, 
<br>
causing a whirlpool effect into which I feared I'd fall. In his 
<br>
cornered-animal gaze darting back and forth I saw mirrored my own 
<br>
deep unpreparedness for so many of the tasks I'm faced with in life. 
<br>
My Gore reverie evaporated as I unwillingly looked and looked again. 
<br>
With dumb luck, and completely unintentionally, Bush's old-guy 
<br>
Republican handlers had created a compelling piece of reality TV 
<br>
simply by the confusion in their candidate's eyes.
<br>
<p>W. Bush's visible confusion and lostness during the campaign, oddly enough, may help explain why he did as well in the
<br>
election as he did. Lost, he may have seemed more real, more live; we watch the tightrope walker more closely when it
<br>
appears he is about to fall. Bill Clinton, a political prodigy, held our attention by staying one step ahead with
<br>
hard-to-categorize deeds we kept having to judge and argue about. W. Bush is a more average person, as unremarkable as
<br>
the generation to which he belongs. It's a generation that doesn't have a lot to show for itself; so far, it hasn't
<br>
started a new country, ended slavery, won a world war. Maybe we will still accomplish something great. Maybe the best we
<br>
can hope for is just not to do too much wrong. When I look in W. Bush's eyes I see our clock ticking, and the chances
<br>
for true inspiration slipping away.
