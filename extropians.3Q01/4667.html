<p><em>&gt;Private education isn't affordable for everyone at this time because:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1. You already are paying for it through taxes, therefore you don't have it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to put to private schools.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2. If private schools were the norm, there would be many grades of schools,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the ivy league expensive schools to the moderate but adequate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;wal-mart&quot; versions that would carry most the students. Considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economies of scales, I would estimate that if public schools went away, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;after the market stabilized in a few years, your taxes may drop 10-15
</em><br>
<em>&gt;percent (in theory) and the cost of the average private school to be about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2k-5k per year. IMOHO. Pretty reasonable when you factor that price being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;able to be paid over the entire year and with your increase of income from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lower taxes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This sound too far off base to any of you supply siders?
</em><br>
<p>$5K per year?  Maybe.  $2K per year?  No way.  Come September I'll be paying 
<br>
$8,500 for a year's worth of a 1st grade education (and that's one of the 
<br>
cheapest schools I could find in the entire county).  Even at that the 
<br>
school is constantly griping the entire year that they don't have enough to 
<br>
pay the teachers a decent wage, and they're constantly asking for donations 
<br>
and help with fundraisers all year long.
<br>
<p>An unsubsidized $5K per year elementary school education is probably going 
<br>
to buy you a classroom where kids outnumber teachers by 40 to 1, and a 
<br>
teacher who is earning barely enough to stay above the poverty line.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
