<p>Mike,
<br>
<p>The problem you have not had to contend with is &quot;visible difference.&quot;  You
<br>
were able to assimilate (granted, I am assuming that you are &quot;white&quot;?).  I'm
<br>
an immigrant myself (blonde hair, blue eyes = no questions asked!).  I was
<br>
able to assimilate into American society immediately.  Unless I tell people
<br>
I immigrated here, they have no idea.  Both you and I enjoy privileges
<br>
unknown to many people of &quot;visible-other&quot; races.
<br>
<p>&quot;Visible difference&quot; is what makes this phenomenon happen occasionally:  An
<br>
&quot;average (white) American-type&quot; may come up an Asian person (who may have
<br>
been born here, and whose parents and grandparents may have been born here
<br>
as well) and ask, &quot;Do you speak English?&quot;  I have a multicultural family,
<br>
and Asian members of my family have experienced this .... as have most Asian
<br>
people, from what I've heard.  The incidents may not be exactly the same,
<br>
but in that vein.
<br>
<p>Blacks have not only had to contend with this problem of &quot;visible
<br>
difference&quot; (in the context of the example above, of people attributing
<br>
certain characteristics to blacks based on their race), they've also had to
<br>
contend with being chattel.  While I'm certain your people have suffered
<br>
some (as many immigrant groups have), you're not saying that the experiences
<br>
blacks have had can compare - in toto - with your ancestors' .... or are
<br>
you?  And if you/your ancestors - were magically put backwards to the time
<br>
of legal segregation in the South (this was relatively recent - within the
<br>
lifetime of some of the &quot;Boomers&quot; on this list), you would not have had the
<br>
problem of trying to find food, lodging, or bathroom facilities while
<br>
traveling through the South.  You would not have had to explain to your
<br>
children why they were not permitted to swim in the pool with the white
<br>
kids.  You would not have been in danger of getting lynched if your eyes
<br>
happened to stray at a white woman - or even if they never strayed.  All
<br>
these indignities were reserved for blacks alone, and (I am repeating
<br>
myself, I know) this was going on within the lifetime of many black people
<br>
alive today.   As an aside, it is interesting to note that the less the
<br>
&quot;visible difference&quot; in blacks, the easier it has been for them to succeed.
<br>
<p>I won't go over what I've written to Lee about why I think we owe something
<br>
especially to blacks.  Their circumstances were - and are - above and beyond
<br>
anything other immigrant (I'm using the term loosely here) groups have had
<br>
to live through.  We are fat-cat sitting on the backs of millions of unknown
<br>
slaves who endured harships and sorrows beyond description.  The heinousness
<br>
of the crime, the length of time (hundreds of years), and how all the past
<br>
misdeeds have affected and are still affecting many blacks today - there's
<br>
nothing to compare to it.  Native Americans are another sad tale, and yet
<br>
the black remains unparalled.
<br>
<p>You also wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt; Even worse, that's guilt by similarity.
</em><br>
<p>You're not guilty of anything, Mike.
<br>
<p>This quote may be relevant to our discussion here:  (from the
<br>
Russell-­Einstein Manifesto): &quot;We appeal, as human beings, to human beings:
<br>
Remember your humanity and forget the rest.&quot;
<br>
<p>On the other hand, maybe that quote means nothing to you.  I understand and
<br>
appreciate that we all have difference prerogatives.
<br>
<p>Thank you for your thoughts,
<br>
Olga
