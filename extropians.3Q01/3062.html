<p>That's entirely true, it *may* contain such defects for the reason
<br>
that you give.  But it is also always *possible*, I'm sure that you
<br>
will agree, that it contains inaccuracies, omissions, and other
<br>
defects that you are simply unaware of.   :-)

<p><em>&gt; -----------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Concept 3: The Paradox of Rationality vs. Integration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can sum up one of the core ideas with this theory with this paradox. Imagine 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you live in a society with only three members, yourself and two neighbors 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Let us say that A likes to kill animals brutally and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worships the Satan, B preaches strong religion and compassion for all, and C, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself, a free thinker and skeptic. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, as you can see, all of you have ideas that conflict with each other.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Note that these are *ideas* which conflict.  As yet, there is no mention
<br>
of harmful conflict.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What if all of you think irrationally (yes, even skeptics can think irrationally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skeptical), refusing to accept each other's perspective?  You will have three 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; options: Shut up about your ideas, start a conflict with your neighbors or live 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away from them.
</em><br>
<p>Wrong, if by &quot;conflict&quot; you mean a development of unhealthy relationships.
<br>
An exchange of ideas is good, and even critical disapproval and disdainfulness
<br>
is often productive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In our society, this happens too often and we find bloodbaths, brutal violence, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and warfare occurring around the world when conflicts spiral out of control.
</em><br>
<p>But often conflicts *need not* spiral out of control.  Most of Earth's people
<br>
actually live in peaceful societies where these bloodbaths, brutal violence,
<br>
and warfare do not occur.  It turns out that anthropological studies have
<br>
discovered that humankind is the most peaceful of all primates.  If you
<br>
carefully and scientifically observe, as students have now done, then per
<br>
thousand hours of observation, human beings are vastly less prone to violence
<br>
than any of the other primates.  This is a point that cannot (almost) be
<br>
repeated too often.  (It is also true that among large mammals, humans
<br>
are comparitively very non-violent.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We can also find censorship, pretensions of a harmonious society and ambiguous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubletalk statements like &quot;everything has the correct point in accordance to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their perspective&quot; when people attempt to minimize conflict
</em><br>
<p>Yes!  Those statements are to be denounced and challenged at every turn!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and impose their way.
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't follow at all!  In fact, it's those very people who refuse to admit
<br>
(more or less) that conflict among ideas exists, who are often the least
<br>
likely to attempt to impose their way on others.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; You may wonder what if we all think rationally even when starting with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational beliefs. In such a case, we will actively seek viewpoints contrary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to our own to minimize guilt (of learning about the truth too late) and in our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quest for a more accurate personal theory about the universe.
</em><br>
<p>Very well said.  I had never suspected that guilt (or embarrassment)
<br>
was a factor, but yes, that's true too.   And long live our quests
<br>
for not only a more accurate personal theory about the universe, but
<br>
for theories whose truth appeals to all people and intelligent entities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eventually, through the free exchange of incompatible views and from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our seeking of more knowledge, we will come across a theory that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfies all the logical prerequisites.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that should be rephrased.  I totally agree with the idea 
<br>
behind it, but literally it is not at all true that a theory
<br>
that satisfied *all* the logical prerequisites---I would say
<br>
requirements---will necessarily ever be found.  We must strive
<br>
only (and always) towards *better* explanations.  A completely
<br>
satisfactory explanation may always elude us, and worse, may
<br>
not in some cases even exist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since this theory and our other theories will mutually exclude 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other, so we can only believe in this theory and only this theory.
</em><br>
<p>Correct. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Hence, in a society with even one irrational member, we have to exercise 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; censorship to prevent conflicts from occurring, or we will have to live outside 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other's influence.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't read your ideas about new colonies or whatever, but
<br>
I myself in a different thread posted what may be a similar
<br>
idea, namely, that *distance* is a proven safeguard against
<br>
overwhelming force, radical technology, or dangerous physical
<br>
conflicts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, in a society with only rational members, we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will eventually come to a common consensus while enjoying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free speech.  Hence, the paradox shows itself.
</em><br>
<p>I see no paradox so far.
<br>
<p>By the way, it is asking a whole lot for a large society to
<br>
consist entirely of rational members.  By that, I mean that
<br>
there will always be people, unfortunately, who reason extremely
<br>
poorly or never engage in it, or who are mentally unstable,
<br>
or who stick to peculiar and aberrant dogmas.
