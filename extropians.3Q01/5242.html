Forwarding something which may be of interest to some of you extropes
<br>
tonight ... Olga
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Subject: NIGHTLINE: Fertility and the Law
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TONIGHT'S FOCUS: For some parents these days, making a baby is less an act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of physical intimacy and more like a legal and financial transaction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While these technologies have helped countless childless adults become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents, it has also created a slew of legal quandaries. The question that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the courts are often left to answer is, what makes a parent?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ----
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Egg donors. Sperm banks. In vitro fertilization. Surrogate mothers. All of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these modern day reproduction techniques have helped thousands of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become parents who might otherwise never have had that opportunity. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's probably fair to say that in the overwhelming majority of cases,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these families are the better for it.  Few of these families ever end up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in court, battling for custody or money or both.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But some do. These technologies have also spawned a slew of complicated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawsuits. Perhaps you have heard of some of these well publicized cases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is the case of the surrogate mother who discovered she was carrying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twins and refused to abort one of the fetuses, as the adoptive parents'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contract required.  There is the case of the couple who, through in vitro
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fertilization, were able to conceive not one, but four children through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anonymously donated sperm. But when the parents divorced before the birth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who is required to pay child support? The sperm donor or the ex-husband?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As Lewis Carroll wrote in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, things are getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;curioser and curioser.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tonight Nightline's Chris Bury reports on several of these current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawsuits.  As Chris explains, the law is like the turtle to the hare of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology.  While medical science and the internet create new and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicated family arrangements every year, the courts move achingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slowly, especially where precedent is so scarce. State and federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legislatures have largely been loathe to write new laws in these areas, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politicians run from them like political hot potatoes. Ted Koppel will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moderate a discussion about the ethical and legal morass with two women
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experts in these fields.  As you will see tonight, none of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations has easy answers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We hope you'll join us.
