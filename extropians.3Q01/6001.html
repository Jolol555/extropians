<p>:-) Hmmm...
<br>
<p>Yes, I can see the depth of evil empire-building going on here as being 
<br>
impressive in its arrogance, but I can also see it pissing off an 
<br>
incredible number of people to an insane degree.
<br>
<p>The movie industry has already generated enormous negative karma points by 
<br>
actively impeding people's ability to buy the DVDs that they want, and have 
<br>
spawned a small and growing industry of DVD players that have no area 
<br>
codes. I was chatting to a friend tonight who was telling me he happened 
<br>
across a shop recently that advertised in the window that their DVD players 
<br>
had no area codes. He, up until then, had not intended to buy a DVD player. 
<br>
I have some time ago subverted the area coding of my own player after 
<br>
having accidentally bought a Fantasia 3 DVD pack encoded for USA.
<br>
<p>The music industry is creating an immense amount of nasty karma from not 
<br>
only the buying public but also the artists they represent -- even quite 
<br>
famous ones.
<br>
<p>Napster, and similar organisations have been attempts to get around such 
<br>
creepy monsters. People freely distribute the binaries to undo DVD drive 
<br>
encoding to rid themselves of restrictive straightjackets imposed upon 
<br>
them. And this is only the beginning.
<br>
<p>We live in a society more highly connected than ever before. Such attempts 
<br>
to tie all of humanity up into tight little boxes for all of eternity might 
<br>
seem to work for a time, but I can't believe it will last. The more 
<br>
strongly they piss people off, the more strong will be the backlash.
<br>
<p>Microsoft et al may think they are being really cute trying to rig the net 
<br>
so that they have total control, but I can't help feeling that they are 
<br>
just aiming an incredibly big cannon at their own feet.
<br>
<p>I am not saying we should be complacent. On the contrary, we should speak 
<br>
out at every opportunity about restrictive practices and infringements upon 
<br>
our freedoms. But in the words of the wonderful Douglas Adams: &quot;Don't panic.&quot;
<br>
<p>Excuse me if I mix my metaphors, but I'll happily watch the big nasties 
<br>
fiddle while they burn their bridges.  :-)
<br>
<p>Anyway, my own 2 cents.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

To the optimist, the glass is half full.

To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.

To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
