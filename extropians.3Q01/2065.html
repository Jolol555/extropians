The issue I'm trying to define throughout, as precisely as I can, is simply
<br>
why it is wrong for the law to be what it is, ie to include tax legislation
<br>
etc. And this means that I want a more general answer to the question: what
<br>
kinds of laws are morally acceptable (or morally binding)? 
<br>
_________________________
<br>
<p><p>I know that I some of my emails might seem to come off as a rant, sorry if
<br>
it seems that way. Im not trying to glue my feet on a soapbox, its just
<br>
really hard for me to divorce myself from these concepts and not have them
<br>
affect me on a very primal level. I will say I am still refining my views
<br>
and still have a lot of work to do on them, so I dont have answers to some
<br>
of the questions your stating quiet yet. They do point me into good
<br>
directions to explore and get tied down and I thank you for that. That being
<br>
said, Ill try to answer this question best I can.
<br>
<p>I do think law and morality are 2 different things. Law &quot;should&quot; embody
<br>
morality perfectly (in a perfect world), but that people still would have a
<br>
right to choose to do immoral things as long as it didnt violate others
<br>
rights (perfect definition to be defined some time in the future as well).
<br>
The science of law has the burden to uncover the structure that the law
<br>
should take, but they cant very well do their job until the framework for an
<br>
objective morality is fleshed out. I think HUGE strides have been made in
<br>
objective philosophy, but the prerequisites for building it wasnt availible
<br>
till Rand nailed down some basic issues here recently. Now that some basics
<br>
can be discerned, the field will march forward and the proofs and answers
<br>
will come.
<br>
<p>Im man enough to admit that I cant lay out the entire argument in detail, Im
<br>
not a philosophy major, but I can spot where philosophy crosses a few lines
<br>
in the sand that I have worked out. I can say with my present level of
<br>
knowledge that one principle that has yet to be proven wrong is: &quot;No force
<br>
is to be initiated on another person&quot;. Keep in mind the context, force can
<br>
be used for defence. Fraud does count as an indirect use of force. This
<br>
sounds to me like a wonderful concept. I can imagine such a world where
<br>
force is banished. This is why taxes are wrong, and may be a very good
<br>
boundary to put on a government.
<br>
<p>P.S. James Madison said:
<br>
In its larger and juster meaning...a man has property in his opinions and
<br>
the free communication of them...in the free use of his faculties and free
<br>
choice of the objects on which to employ them. In a word, as a man is said
<br>
to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to have a property
<br>
in his rights.
