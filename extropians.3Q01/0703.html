From: &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20Debunk%20All%20Religiosity%20Equally%20(D.A.R.E.)&In-Reply-To=&lt;021e01c1094e$a5c16aa0$9e5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; This is a typical example of bad statistical analysis.  Without positing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause and effect, it is invalid to conclude that church going makes people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live longer.  A more likely analysis is that people who live longer (i.e.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; older) tend to go to church more than younger people.
</em><br>
<p>This resembles the old cause-and-effect-reversal that &quot;married people live
<br>
longer&quot; used as an argument for getting married. Actually, people who live
<br>
longer (because they're healthy and able-bodied) are more likely to marry.
<br>
Similarly, going to church doesn't help people live longer, but a long life
<br>
wears down one's critical thinking ability and social skills to the point
<br>
where church-going becomes attractive. Furthermore, just because people go to
<br>
church doesn't mean they believe the crap that's peddled there. I've known
<br>
several people who go to church to score with the opposite sex, to promote
<br>
their marketing schemes, and other shrewd purposes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Older people grew up in earlier times which were more church oriented.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; older people get, the closer they are to death, and the more interested they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are in an afterlife.  Many activities that are contrary to church-going,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as sex or busy weekends, tend to decrease as one gets older.  People
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who died already could not participate in the survey.
</em><br>
<p>LOL, excellent points. &quot;Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to
<br>
die,&quot; so why do religionists promulgate the myth that church-going allows you
<br>
to live longer? Seems like they should be bragging that going to church allows
<br>
you to go to heaven sooner!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In other words, this survey doesn't show anything except that the average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; church goer is older than the average nonchurch goer!
</em><br>
<p>Yep, that it does. I don't like to see anyone suffer, so I'm all for letting
<br>
religionists go to heaven right now!

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
