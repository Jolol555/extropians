<em>&gt;From: Greg Burch &lt;<a href="mailto:gregburch@gregburch.net?Subject=Re:%20Letter%20to%20NPR%20re%20Duncan%20Moon's%209/18%20piece%20on%20Islamic%20reaction%20to%20the%20911%20attacks&In-Reply-To=&lt;F229s0T4szGsA7MnuXo00001c5d@hotmail.com&gt;">gregburch@gregburch.net</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;  I have just listened to Duncan Moon's September 18 piece on Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reaction to the terrorist attacks on the United States.  I do not doubt the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sincerity of the moderate Islamic clerics who spoke in this piece, but I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doubt that Mr. Moon knows anything about Islam and especially about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;central scripture of that religion, the Koran.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Like the rest of the U.S. press corps, Mr. Moon has passed on without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question the statements by moderate Muslims that &quot;Islam does not endorse
</em><br>
<em>&gt;violence.&quot;  We will not as a nation come to understand how and why the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;events of September 11 occurred until we take the time to study Islam and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;develop an understanding of how a large number of people in the world use
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religion to justify violence.  The simple and undisputable fact is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there is clear and explicit language in the Koran that:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &lt;&gt; endorses the use of violence against &quot;unbelievers&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &lt;&gt; requires that Islamic countries institute legal discrimination against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-Muslims
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &lt;&gt; demands unequal treatment of women
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How do we, as a free people, come to terms with these facts?  How do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moderate Muslims rationalize their calls for peace and tolerance in light 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the clear and unambiguous text of their scripture to the contrary?  How can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;democracy flourish in cultures where a religion based on that scripture is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enshrined in law?  These are the hard questions that our contemporary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cultural relativism apparently makes it impossible to ask.  By dodging 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;questions, NPR does not encourage a pursuit of truth, but rather becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complicit in our civilization's unwillingness to come to terms with them.
</em><br>
<p>Not that I disagree with your points.  In fact, as ususal, I wholeheartedly 
<br>
agree with you.  But perhaps we are not qualified to pull the beam out of 
<br>
our brother's eye while ignoring the mote in our own eye.
<br>
<p>In particular, the Bible also has passages which support the same things 
<br>
which you point out are contained in the Q'uran.  And while it is true that 
<br>
our government is technically based on the doctrine of separation of church 
<br>
and state, our laws and Constitution are clearly founded upon and/or 
<br>
informed by Judeo-Christian mores and ethics.  As a for instance, think of 
<br>
the legal quagmires which are abortion, stem cell research and euthanasia in 
<br>
this country.
<br>
<p>Of course the good ol' US of A is nowhere near a theocracy on the order of, 
<br>
say, the Taliban.  But on closer analysis it may be that the difference is 
<br>
only one of degree, rather than kind?
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
