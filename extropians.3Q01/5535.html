<p>Let's take the varnish off, shall we?
<br>
<p>Caveat: I am not picking fights here, I am speaking simply and boldly and
<br>
&quot;humanistically&quot;--sloppily, even--about the broad outlines of human tendencies.
<br>
<p>Transhumans are outliers. Enthusiasts self-select. Extropians tend to be small-l
<br>
libertarians, and some are Randites.
<br>
<p>Now, &quot;Leave me the hell alone!&quot; can very easily intersect with
<br>
&quot;I'm all right, Jack!&quot; and even &quot;Devil take the hindmost!&quot;.
<br>
<p>One needs a very good filter for babies when one is processing this much bathwater.
<br>
And that figure of speech applies to critics as much as it does to selfish transhumans.
<br>
<p>I favor a world where people are excellent to each other. Why? Because it's _BETTER ART_.
<br>
In my more mystical moments, I imagine that being the answer behind the answer that
<br>
God gave the lead character at the end of Kevin Smith's _Dogma_. 
<br>
<p>The question? &quot;Why are we here?&quot;
<br>
<p>Do you know the Enneagram stuff? I'm not sure it's worth a whole lot, but I'd
<br>
guess that I habitually have operated in &quot;#6&quot;. Any guesses about other list
<br>
participants?
<br>
<p>For the skeptical and Enneagram-impaired: Enneagram minuses include an association 
<br>
with Gurdjieff; the pluses include that I find a personal correspondence with 
<br>
&quot;#6&quot; and my otherwise peculiar-seeming &quot;loyalist/paranoid&quot; drives.
<br>
<p>Hey. Given that there are 9 Enneagram types, 12 natal horological astrology signs,
<br>
and 16 Myers-Briggs types, which is the most scientific? :)
