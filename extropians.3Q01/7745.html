<em>&gt; It sounds like it could well be a problem.  I think I read something about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putting anti-aircraft missiles at nuclear sites.  Unfortunately they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't get much warning since it may not be obvious that a plane is off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course until it's very close.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>1) Ugly answer: Put a fat R-zone (Restricted) around every nukeplant
<br>
just like the one around the White House; add Patriot batteries
<br>
as needed. 
<br>
<p>Back of envelope calculations I did recently for ground school: 
<br>
A closing rate of 100 knots gives ca. 12 seconds per 1000 feet.
<br>
600 knots is, obviously, 2 seconds per 1000 feet or 10 seconds
<br>
per mile.
<br>
<p>2) Another approach would be to treat domestic heavies in such a way that
<br>
they are not allowed to fuel up for (say) more than a 500-mile leg.
<br>
No more coast-to-coast nonstops over land. This will have some 
<br>
significant costs, as they will be operating much less efficiently
<br>
(climbing and descending) for most of their flight hours. Probably a
<br>
nonstarter.
<br>
<p>3) Down the road, semiballistics would have more predictable flight
<br>
paths in normal operation, and a reentry-phase SDI-type followon 
<br>
might be suited to neutralize any mispointed flight.
<br>
<p>4) Not sure how to defend against a swarm of smaller craft: banks of
<br>
Phalanx guns, perhaps? DU slugs are right out, but tungsten would
<br>
probably suffice, especially if the glassy-metals work pans out.
<br>
<p>5) The neural-net stuff done to detect &quot;hincty&quot; human behavior from
<br>
raw video would seem to be worth investigating for a SkyNet-type
<br>
system. Ruh roh.
<br>
<p>Interesting times, you betcha,
