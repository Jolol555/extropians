(Originally sent as a private email to Damien; Damien asked that I forward
<br>
it on to the list.  Slightly edited/augmented.)
<br>
<p>==
<br>
<p>My take on minimum guaranteed income (MGI):
<br>
<p>1)  To the extent that the disruption you postulate is *not* being
<br>
produced by ultraefficient AIs, it may not be a good investment for me to
<br>
form an opinion.  Often there *are* no good answers to pre-Singularity
<br>
moral questions, and I tend to view pre-Singularity capitalism as a means
<br>
to an end.  A lot of MGI debate seems to turn on whose &quot;fault&quot; it is.  I
<br>
don't *care* whose fault it is, and since I'm trying to solve the problem
<br>
by means other than proposing new structures of social humans, I have no
<br>
*need* to decide whose fault it is.  This is a moral question that will
<br>
make no sense post-Singularity, and my social contribution consists not of
<br>
rendering a judgement on the moral question and helping to produce social
<br>
conformity, but in working to turn the moral question into nonsense.
<br>
<p>2)  To the extent that the disruption you postulate is being produced by
<br>
efficient but not hard-takeoff AIs, a rapid-producing Friendly AI would
<br>
not care about green pieces of paper, or even vis own welfare,
<br>
except as means to an end, and would be expected to approach philanthropy
<br>
rather differently than humans.  Possibly one of the few plausible paths
<br>
to a minimum guaranteed income without the need for government.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scenario is highly implausible due to the expected Singularity
<br>
dynamics, and I mention it purely so that I can't be accused of &quot;blowing
<br>
off a possible problem&quot; just because it's a Slow-Singularity scenario.
<br>
<p>3)  To the extent that the disruption you postulate is being produced by a
<br>
hard takeoff, I don't expect any problems as a result; quite the
<br>
opposite.  A nanotech-equipped Transition Guide is perfectly capable of
<br>
giving poor people as well as rich people what they want, if in fact the
<br>
Transition Guide would even notice the difference, which is unlikely. 
<br>
(&quot;Notice&quot; in the decisionmaking, not perceptual, sense).  Under the Sysop
<br>
Scenario, everyone gets an equal piece of the Solar System, again
<br>
disregarding as utterly irrelevant any existing Earthbound wealth
<br>
inequities.
<br>
<p>Basically, I don't see a minimum guaranteed income as being necessary or
<br>
desirable at any point in the next decade if the Singularity occurs in
<br>
2010; we don't yet have enough ultraproductivity to blow off the
<br>
production drop introduced by the incentive change of an MGI system, and I
<br>
don't expect to see that pre-Singularity.  I don't expect the Singularity
<br>
to be delayed until 2030, but if it is, I'll be doing what I can on the
<br>
near-human Friendly AI side of it in the meanwhile.
