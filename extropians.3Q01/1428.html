<p>Nor does it become more difficult to stop the nukes that have already

been built, which will likely find their way into the international market
<br>
at bargain prices in the next few years.  The Grand Poobah of Outer
<br>
Butfukistan will be shopping for sure.  Many are the potential customers
<br>
who can afford only one missile, and have not the sophistication to
<br>
actually modify what has already been built.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    an effective ABM system does.
</em><br>
<p>Only for sophisticated nations.  SDI is not designed to deter them.

<p><em>&gt; 2) In 1903 the Wright brothers did not claim to have the technology to start a

</em><br>
<p>Nor do we need that.  We have demonstrated, with *current technology*
<br>
the ability to hit a warhead with about 50% probability with a single ABM.
<br>
It would be easy and cheap to stop development now, deploy a bunch
<br>
of them and provide a modicum of protection against single missiles,
<br>
fired accidentally or in anger.  Thats with todays tech.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They did not demand government money to make it happen either.
</em><br>
<p>John, the *government* is *asking* its defence contractors to build
<br>
these things.  Your comment makes it sound like the contractors are
<br>
begging or demanding the government to pay for their pet projects.
<br>
The contractors would far rather make fighter planes, thats where
<br>
the *real* money is, not these missiles.  Missiles are *cheapy cheap*
<br>
compared to state of the art planes.
<br>
<p>If anything, the defense contractors would rather not make ABMs
<br>
because they make fighter planes obsolete.  A couple weeks ago a
<br>
PAC3 took out a drone fighter plane which was using all the radar
<br>
jamming, chaff, flares, evasive maneuvering etc, that we have today.
<br>
Tradition fighter planes are now helpless against the Patriot missile.  spike
