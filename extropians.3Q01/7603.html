</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;A year or so back, there was a brief discussion on the list of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;sub-orbital dynamics of a vehicle connecting distant places via an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;evacuated tube under the ground ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amara Graps wrote: The thread was titled: &quot;Cooling technique for Jupiter brains&quot; in early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; February 2000.  (Doug Jones, Jeff Davis, Robert Bradbury, Spike Jones and I discussing).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I remember Spike and I having a blast throwing each other junk through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tunnel. Our physical setup depended on a chord-tunnel through a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constant density sphere, though, so it was only an ideal situation...
</em><br>
<p>Amara's post reminded me of that exchange and some entertaining
<br>
analysis we did at the time.  I recalled that if one assumes a frictionless
<br>
track in an evacuated tunnel, one can drop stuff in anywhere and
<br>
have it pop out anywhere, regardless of the shape of the tunnel.  A
<br>
chord is not an ideal solution.  A faster trip can be had by making
<br>
the tunnel parabolic, so the path length is actually longer but the
<br>
initial acceleration is greater.  The question that I am now trying
<br>
to resolve is this:  assuming no push along the frictionless track,
<br>
what is the shape of the track that makes for the shortest time
<br>
in transit?  I think the shape is a catenary, but I havent proved it.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, since we are talking about frictionless evacuated tunnels,
<br>
an acceptable solution would be to build the tunnels at a constant
<br>
depth of about 4.5 km.  Such could theoretically be built.  After
<br>
the car descends to that depth, regardless of the shape of the
<br>
path down there under these assumptions, it would be travelling
<br>
at about 300 meters/sec, so the trip from anywhere to anywhere
<br>
would be at speed about competitive with current airline travel.
<br>
<p>Amara pointed out to me a year and a half ago that the solution
<br>
is path independent.
<br>
<p>The moon would be the place for such a device, since the vacuum
<br>
is already available and the absence of plate tectonics.  spike
