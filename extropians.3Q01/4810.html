<em>&gt;From: &quot;Chen Yixiong, Eric&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:cyixiong@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20Media%20ignores%20Ballistic%20Missle%20Defense%20lies&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108241511.IAA24917@well.com&gt;">cyixiong@yahoo.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;The only problem occurs when someone sends in stealth nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;missiles, in the sense that someone attacks you but you don't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who. Only in this case would a nuclear defense have any use.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Someone could probably send a submarine into range of the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cities and fire the missiles.
</em><br>
<p>Great idea, now we'll build an antisubmarine defense as well.
<br>
Happy?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you build some missile shield that works, maybe you can stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them, but maybe they will just send in agents with smuggled
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nuclear briefcases and time bombs instead. Even if you build an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effective nuclear shield (with an accuracy of over 99.99%, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the enemy can use decoys and one &quot;escaped&quot; bomb can devastate an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entire city), the cost may get too prohibitive and the actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protection close to nil.
</em><br>
<p>Everyone continues to ignore the fact that the antimissle defense
<br>
is not designed to counter an all out attack by a major power, but
<br>
a small attack by a rogue power.
<br>
<p>In such a case the rules are completely different.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Unfortunately, this nuclear shield does not work, and it costs so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much that even the military wants to shift this item from its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;budget to someone else's.
</em><br>
<p>Does not work at the moment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This sounds like the Libertarian problem of either conscripting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people to fight a war to defend a Libertarian nation, hiring
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mercenaries at tremendous cost or letting the obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-Libertarian enemy overrun the nation. We count in not just the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cost of construction, but also how much more debt can the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shoulder and what consequences would this cause to world peace.
</em><br>
<p>Explain how a defensive system affects world peace.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;By breaking the relatively stable MAD equilibrium, the US may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cause an arms race to occur that it can ill afford given its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weakened financial support, but which it has a good chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;winning and bankrupting its enemies. This arms race will also have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a low probability of causing a nuclear war directly, but it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;greatly increase such chances by forcing countries like China to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increase its arsenal. This will cause India, and then Pakistan, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;follow suit. A multi-polar world would have lesser stable points
</em><br>
<em>&gt;along its probability space and more proneness to random events
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that could &quot;tip the balance&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;MAD&quot; equilibrium disappeared with the fall of the USSR, and in
<br>
case you weren't aware, China has superpower designs and is going
<br>
to build its arsenal accordingly. When China starts refering to
<br>
Singapore as &quot;The Lost Colonies&quot; you'll understand.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Given such a situation and analysis, I urge the US to immediately
</em><br>
<em>&gt;back down from its stance of building a nuclear shield, issue an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apology to the world and concentrate on building local defenses
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(such as bunkers and missile silos). This has nothing to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the right to defend oneself, or US politics, but plain economics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and game theory.
</em><br>
<p>I find your analysis faulty, no doubt the pentagon does as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The US should cooperate with the rest of the world in signing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;important treaties such as the landmine banning treaty and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;additional nuclear reduction treaties. Why would any nation want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to attack or blackmail the US? Probably because they perceive the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;US as an arrogant bully (so with a moral justification) or that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the US interfered with their affairs (so with a practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;justification).
</em><br>
<p>As a former soldier I am against the landmine treaty neither China
<br>
nor Russia signed it and I don't hear anyone giving them grief
<br>
about it. It was necessary to change the small arms treaty because
<br>
of clauses that interferred with americans right to keep and bear
<br>
arms, those changes were made and the treaty was signed. The Kyoto
<br>
protocol is a joke and the administration that supported it was
<br>
replaced. This does not mean new agreements are not possible.
<br>
<p>Yet, there are nuclear reduction talks going on which will
<br>
hopefully result in a treaty. We will be delighted to be involved
<br>
in other treaties, especially those that are mutually beneficial.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The US should diplomatically preemptively defuse any such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;potential situation instead of trying to stop a nuclear attack in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;progress. An apple a day keeps the doctor away, and with Big Apple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;round, the US should know better.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that we should make every effort in this regard, however
<br>
only an idiot leaves himself/herself defenseless.
