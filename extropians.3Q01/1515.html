<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Have seen the movie &quot;Rollerball&quot;, Lee?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, all right.  I'll answer.  Yes, I did see the movie
<br>
but it was a very long time ago.  I agree with Chris
<br>
Hibbert who writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I recall, this movie was a work of fiction.  If this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the best argument for the existence and danger of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monopoly, I don't think I'll need to say much more.
</em><br>
<p>Now sometimes certain &quot;examples&quot;, even fictional ones,
<br>
are mind-expanding.  But they don't replace argument, of
<br>
course.  Actually, come to think of it, their chief role
<br>
concerning issues is as propaganda, e.g., &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;,
<br>
&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;,
<br>
&quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, and &quot;Seven Days in May&quot;.
<br>
<p>To the question, &quot;can I imagine a few corporations getting
<br>
so much 'power' that it would be undesireable&quot;, the answer
<br>
is yes.  If we exclude the present case of corporations
<br>
having real power solely through governments---via the men,
<br>
guns, and badges that belong to governments---then all that
<br>
I can imagine is a set of corporations whose holdings are so
<br>
vast that they can be said to own everything: my land, my
<br>
house, and my computer equipment.  I will go on record as
<br>
opposing corporations becoming that &quot;powerful&quot;.
