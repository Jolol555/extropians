</em><br>
<p>No I'm simply stating the truth. Here in Atlanta a lot of construction
<br>
work is done with the help of illegal immigrants from Mexico. So many
<br>
in fact that this area has become known in Mexico as a hotspot for work,
<br>
and many states around here (for instance TN) are starting to give out
<br>
driving licenses to them even though they lack INS documentation.
<br>
<p>But this is all far off topic from what I was commenting on (hypothetical
<br>
lack of &quot;nail pounding&quot; jobs in the future if you'll recall...).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A few weeks ago Natasha posted &quot;I explain this by referencing other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies such as the telephone, television, computers and cell phones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At first, only those with money or connections had them.  Today, in downtown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Los Angeles, there are more Mexicans using cell phones than executives.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are all these insinuations about &quot;Mexicans&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>I think you're having a knee jerk reaction, spotting particular words
<br>
everywhere you see them, and in general steering discussion off topic. My
<br>
message had absolutely no focus on Mexicans, and made no judgements about
<br>
Mexicans, yet now I find myself being accused of &quot;insinuations&quot;, and have
<br>
to waste my time writing this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And -- perhaps this is even more important -- what is the way you talk about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a group of people say about you?  This does not portend well for the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you guys are going to be in it, IMHO.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have time for PC crap. Why not take it somewhere else and waste
<br>
their time with it?
