Reason said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;1) cut to the chase sooner. Condense those first two paragraphs into one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sentence [&quot;things are a-changin'&quot;] and start directly with &quot;we have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prepared to live longer.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Not sure I agree with this. If it was an academic essay, perhaps so - every 
<br>
word has to count. But I think it is okay to lead in gently with a speech to 
<br>
a non-specialised audience like this, or even in a newspaper feature article 
<br>
(a hard news story requires a different technique again).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;2) remove references to SciFi works; no matter how great they are, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;majority of the populance looks down their nose at SciFi.
</em><br>
<p>Hey, Reason: &quot;Never say 'SciFi'!&quot;  :-)  The accepted abbreviation among 
<br>
those who care about the genre is &quot;SF&quot; or &quot;sf&quot;.
<br>
<p>That said, Reason is absolutely right. Sadly, the reference to _Dune_ has to 
<br>
go.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;3) people like a challenge -- consider that everyone around 25-40 today
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stands on the greatest cusp in history.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;Sigh.&gt; Us over 40s are in trouble again.
<br>
<p>Cheers
<br>
