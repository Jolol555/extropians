Jerry said
<br>
<p>If I
<br>
<em>&gt;want my company to go from my sole ownership to some multiple ownership
</em><br>
<em>&gt;situation, sure I could just get all parties involved to sign a contract.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But who then is responsible if the company hurts someone? All the owners I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would assume at that point. Corporations seem to be sheltered from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;responsibility a great deal (which I assume is the point of making one). Is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there an alternative to this that doesn't involve the initiation of force 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;someone?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I understand your question.
<br>
<p>(1) If you mean &quot;Is there an alternative to limited liability without 
<br>
imposing force?&quot;, why yes. You just do away with laws allowing for 
<br>
incorporation, limited liability etc. You need positive state action to 
<br>
produce these things. Unless everyone unanimously approves of such state 
<br>
action, it seems that a consistent &quot;no-coercion&quot; libertarian should say that 
<br>
it should never have happened and there should be no corporations. This, of 
<br>
course, would be a very different world, but so be it, if you take such a 
<br>
position (it's one that I have *some* attraction to, at a theoretical 
<br>
level). Note that, contrary to a post of Mike Lorrey's, nothing has really 
<br>
been &quot;banned&quot;. We just haven't acknowledged that the government has a 
<br>
mandate to pass certain laws bequeathing corporate privileges on trading 
<br>
associations. I think Mike is logically committed to this scenario.
<br>
<p>(2) If you mean, &quot;Is there a way to gain the benefit of limited liability 
<br>
without the need for state intervention?&quot;, again there is (up to a point). 
<br>
Your unincorporated trading association would have to write into its 
<br>
contracts with suppliers, customers etc that it would be liable for loss 
<br>
only up to a certain amount,
<br>
<p>Now there are some problems with this. First, why would any supplier etc 
<br>
sign such a one-sided contract. Well, some might be prepared to if the 
<br>
benefit was mutual, but this wouldn't normally apply to customers who are 
<br>
natural persons. Perhaps if your trading association had a monopoly it could 
<br>
force people to sign such contracts. However, these associations might not 
<br>
find it easy to grow huge and create monopolies in the first place. They 
<br>
might never have that kind of market power.
<br>
<p>Jerry, it seems to me that a lot of people who call themselves libertarians 
<br>
imagine we could just abolish all government action, or all government 
<br>
action except a minimalist police operation plus the military, and the world 
<br>
would be much the same except for the absence of taxes. I think you have to 
<br>
think through all the social and political implications. As someone said, 
<br>
there is nothing &quot;natural&quot; about capitalism, even if it is a good idea. Even 
<br>
&quot;property&quot; might be a very different concept in this world. How much of the 
<br>
idea of &quot;property&quot; is natural? Maybe some of it (we don't *necessarily* have 
<br>
to go all the way with Proudhon: &quot;property is theft&quot;), but exactly what 
<br>
would be the preconditions for something becoming property in your ideal 
<br>
system, and why?  People like Locke, Nozick and Rothbard have tried to 
<br>
answer this, but none of the answers are very convincing.
<br>
<p>Moreover, even if you are attracted to libertarianism in theory (as part of 
<br>
me is) how do you get there from here? With all the changes you'd need to 
<br>
make, you'd need to be very, very careful. If you come to think that 
<br>
corporations and taxes are *both* distortions of the theoretically best 
<br>
libertarian-capitalist system, for example, maybe taxes are currently 
<br>
necessary to ensure that we at least live in the &quot;second best&quot; system. It 
<br>
might be possible to argue that a system with no taxes but with corporations 
<br>
is worse than the current system with both.
<br>
<p>I don't have strong opinions on these issues, but I do have an intellectual 
<br>
interest. And I do say that someone with such strong opinions as you have 
<br>
expressed needs a theory of political obligation to hang his preferred 
<br>
system on. What if it turns out that we are not politically obliged to 
<br>
honour contracts with corporations because governments are not morally 
<br>
entitled to grant limited liability in the first place? There goes the 
<br>
neighbourhood ... maybe.
<br>
<p>Over to you in a minute, but I just want to add that I can't see how any 
<br>
kind of libertarian philosophy is necessary for transhumanism. I do think 
<br>
that we need some form of *liberalism* (in the Enlightenment sense) so our 
<br>
plans cannot be blocked by religious fanatics, etc, but this is a much 
<br>
weaker and less controversial requirement.
<br>
<p>I look forward to your thoughts on all this.
<br>
<p>Regards
<br>
<p>Russell
