<em>&gt; So since the mindless *always* win these fights, who can suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good two-word phrase for a voluntary movement of people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favor obtaining for their children the best natural sperm or eggs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they can?

<p>If that is your aim, then &quot;Eugenics&quot; is not the word you want. From
<br>
Dictionary.com:
<br>

eu·gen·ics (y-jnks)
n. (used with a sing. verb)
The study of hereditary improvement of the human race by controlled
selective breeding. 
---
<p>Note &quot;controlled selective breeding&quot;. ie: selecting the fittest members of a
generation, by given fitness criteria, and allowing only those chosen
members to breed.
<p>The important point is that selective breeding is a centrally controlled
process. The breeders themselves do not make the choice about who breeds;
some external agency does. This is exactly the historical usage of the term.
<p>On the other hand, obtaining the best genetic material for your children is
a more laudable goal. This implies a decentralised decision making process,
resting with the parents. If you accept that it is reasonable to make
fundamental decisions affecting the future of your children (a pretty big
part of a parent's job IMO), then it would fit in as one of a slew of
methods used by transhumanists/extropians to improve the potential of our
children.
<p>I'm not sure if I'd do it personally. I wonder if pre-conception genetic
modification of future generations of humans will make a pinch of
difference, beyond those mods required to stop kids from dying before we can
get full cell repair technology, etc etc. However, I can see how one might
reasonably choose this path of action. Fair enough.
<p>But... it is not Eugenics! There is no need to saddle yourself with such an
inappropriate term, especially one that is (quite justifiably) so negatively
loaded.
