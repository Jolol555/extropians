</em><br>
<p>This has not been my experience at all.  I find most people strongly dislike
<br>
being pigeon-holed into a classification.  Jews don't like being treated
<br>
different because they're Jews.  Blacks don't like being treated different
<br>
because they're blacks.  Women don't like being treated different because
<br>
they're women.  Gays don't like being treated different because they're gay.
<br>
That's the whole point behind equal rights, to treat different groups the
<br>
same.  Religion, race, gender and orientation shouldn't matter.
<br>
<p>I believe diversity will help people become more comfortable with different
<br>
cultures.  It should lessen the problem rather than increase it.
<br>
<p>Besides, I don't know how you can dislike diversity.  People are diverse.
<br>
Do you wish they weren't?  Do you wish all those groups you mentioned would
<br>
be more like straight white males?
<br>
<p>I believe divisiveness and group consciousness is the historical norm.  More
<br>
diversity and mixing of cultures will help people to stop classifying people
<br>
by race or orientation as much.
<br>
<p>Since self-organization, freedom, individuality, competition, free-market
<br>
and sometimes evolution are considered to be primary Extropian principals, I
<br>
find it hard to imagine an Extropian framework that does not seek to promote
<br>
diversity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, it doesn't apply to you, then, if you don't so strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identify with being a woman, or a lesbian, or whatever, to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point that it suppresses your own unique individuality.  I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grant that most of those who do not appreciate diversity will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see you first as a whatever---but, sad to say, most of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who *do* appreciate diversity will also see you first as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever.
</em><br>
<p>A common misconception about &quot;them&quot; or any other group.  Let's assume you
<br>
are a straight white male.  Do you self-identify your racial purity of
<br>
whiteness so much that it suppresses your own unique individuality?  Are you
<br>
so male that you are the same stereotypical guy that every other male
<br>
stereotype is?  Are you so identified as being straight, that you are not an
<br>
individual?  I think it would be rather silly if you were.  If your own
<br>
race, gender and orientation don't prevent you from being an individual, why
<br>
should you project this limitation onto other races, genders or
<br>
orientations?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And the more difficult question is:  to what degree do you feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more comfortable with others who are women and lesbians (not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redundant, it turns out)?  Here is the horror:  you *do* have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more in common with them and so *must* have *some* comfort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; derived from that.  There is the fiendish &quot;reverberant doubt&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a notion derived from what Hofstadter wrote about some game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory tableux:  when not with a woman or a lesbian, you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to wonder, &quot;does this person see me as different and perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot help but doing so and is perhaps asking him/herself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;does this person see me as different and perhaps cannot help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but doing so and is perhaps asking him/herself &quot;does this person...
</em><br>
<p>Maybe you are projecting your own thoughts onto others.  Do you find
<br>
yourself uncomfortable in the presence of women?  Do you prefer the presence
<br>
of men because you worry about how women view you?  Do you feel
<br>
uncomfortable among Jews or blacks?  Do you prefer to be among &quot;your own
<br>
kind&quot;?  If so, you should realize that not everybody feels this way.  If
<br>
not, why do you assume that everyone else must?  Part of the concept of
<br>
diversity is that everybody is different.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, that seems correct to me.  Wish us all luck, because we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are going to need it, pace Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>This sounds ominous.  Do you think diversity is going to cause something bad
<br>
to happen?  Why do we need to wish us all luck?
