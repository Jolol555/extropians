Jesus! Samantha!
<br>
Can't you see that what you are saying is exactly what the terrorists say. 
<br>
That this is exactly how they justify their insane actions??

<p>They feel that they deserve to be righteously angry and attack those who

irresponsible.)

<p>This is *exactly* how they feel. They think their societies, that value the

<p>Yes, the policy makers of USA play by the rules when it suits them (and a 
<br>
terrible number of citizens are right there with them). This is inexcusable 
<br>
for the most powerful country on the planet -- these are the people who 
<br>
have set for themselves the role of global policeman. What would you think 
<br>
of a cop whose excuse for bad behavior was that they didn't rob as many 
<br>
people at gunpoint as another person would?
<br>
<p>But on that point I partly agree. USA is almost certainly less dangerous 
<br>
than many others would be with similar power. However I can think of other 
<br>
nations where I am certain such power would have been handled with more 
<br>
restraint and where the policy makers would have been less tempted to bully 
<br>
and steal.

<p>You have said that again. This is so weird.

Clearly you really do believe that.
<br>
In much of the world USA is seen as a barely restrained bully.
<br>
Can you see that something doesn't quite fit here?

<p>I don't understand why you find it so unbearable to see this. Eliezer is 
<br>
simply stating the truth. It is not hard to verify.
<br>
<p><p>[sigh] I know that I will be jumped upon for saying much of the above so I 
<br>
had better clarify my personal position, though it should not be necessary.
<br>
<p>I don't see USA as peaceful or bully. I see a succession of 
<br>
self-interested, short-tempered foreign policy decisions (and also some 
<br>
other enlightened, helpful foreign policy decisions) by a series of 
<br>
individuals. USA is not a single entity, but a place where millions of 
<br>
individuals live. It is impossible to characterise a large group of people 
<br>
neatly. The people who have made such bad foreign policy were no doubt 
<br>
hard-working people who probably thought they were doing the right thing 
<br>
and had to balance pressures from home against those abroad. But the fact 
<br>
remains that one after another they made many decisions often based upon 
<br>
the arrogance that comes of being extremely powerful and feeling unaccountable.
<br>
<p>Make no mistake, I also see the shining intelligence and learning in that 
<br>
region of the world (USA, Canada, Nth Europe) as a great asset to humanity. 
<br>
Other areas undoubtedly have great value too, but my attraction to science 
<br>
has biased me of course.
<br>
<p>It puzzles me that with such power for good so many people in USA are so 
<br>
totally blinded by nationalistic fervour.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
