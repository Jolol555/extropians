<em>&gt; This doesn't make any sense to me.  My problem with most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who do not appreciate diversity is that they insist on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeing my packaging rather than who I am as a person.  They have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad opinions toward lesbians say and since I am one of them they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see their opinions of lesbians instead of simply seeing me.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not me putting myself in a box or boxes but me fighting to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen as person first and all these various properties of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person second.  People come and a wonderful assortment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flavors.  Be sure to collect the entire set! &lt;g&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - samantha
</em><br>
<p>So we fight to be seen as an individual, and in the same hand start
<br>
preaching the glory of diversity for its own sake, and no one else sees the
<br>
contradiction?
<br>
<p>As for diversity, what factors do we want to be diverse in? If I own a
<br>
company, Ill be sure to hire those with an extra finger and those without.
<br>
Also those that have the letter G in their last name and those without. Get
<br>
my point? What the hell does diversity have to do with the form or function
<br>
of any organization except maybe on the political layer?
