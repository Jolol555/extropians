</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you reckon that people at the bottom of the economic ladder should get

</em><br>
<p>I think that people who do so could send their kids to the same school,
<br>
and apply for financial aid, or else stop popping out brats they can't
<br>
afford.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OK. :-) Do you remember why these people are called poor? It is because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they don't have money. Given the choice between putting food on the table
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and getting their kids some kind of education, guess which will get dropped.
</em><br>
<p>How about dropping the choice of having kids? Guess what? If you have
<br>
half as many kids, you have twice as much disposable income.....
<br>
amazing, ain't it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the upper classes don't want a poverty-stricken class that is self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perpetuating, hates the rich vehemently, and is a breeding ground for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disease and warped memes, then they need to do the sensible and humane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing and ensure that kids of the poor have a chance at a better life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Often the only way to do that is to give them a good education -- free.
</em><br>
<p>Nah, put steroids in the water system, sell bottled water only to people
<br>
with permits to breed. C'mon Mirian, you're the one with the top down,
<br>
&quot;big brother government knows best&quot; ideas. I'd have expected that this
<br>
one would have come naturally to you...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have nothing against private education, but it is not the solution to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; educational needs. Likewise free market economics can be extremely useful,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but there are definite limits to its usefulness.
</em><br>
<p>Especially when some people insist on making others pay for their
<br>
mistakes.
