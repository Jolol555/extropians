<em>&gt; So we have all these billions of people in the world expending their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious impulses and a fraction of their disposable income and time on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religions that aren't really getting anything useful done. Looks just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an established marketplace that's worth entering. Never compete when you
</em><br>
can
<br>
<em>&gt; co-opt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Will it be Father Reason preaching to the faithful at the Church of
<br>
Cynicism?
<br>
As I have said on this list before, I do not have a problem joining forces
<br>
with transhumanists who have religious beliefs. Given that we are all
<br>
working towards the same goal, I think a healthy bit of pragmatism is in
<br>
order here. That is, let us bracket our differences concerning this belief
<br>
since they do not affect our pursuit of our joint goal. Don't we have more
<br>
in common with a religious transhumanist than an atheistic luddite? So, if
<br>
religious transhumanists have access to additional skill-sets or resources,
<br>
so much the better. Furthermore, this setting aside of our differences ought
<br>
only be temporary: If atheististic transhumanism is correct then the
<br>
probability of converting everyone to atheism ought to rise as our
<br>
rationality takes on a qualitative improvement as we become posthuman. On
<br>
the small chance (by our lights at least) that we atheists are wrong, then,
<br>
qua posthumans we ought to be much better at apologizing.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is of course ethics that stops us from adopting Reason's
<br>
proposal--but then may be he just forgot the ':)'.
<br>
<p>(BTW, I see so many strawperson versions of religion attacked as irrational
<br>
on this list. There are some towering intellects among believers, I wish
<br>
their views would be scrutinized. For example, one luminary may be found
<br>
here:
