<em>&gt; &gt;Do you have doubts that a Cessna or a lorry will be unable to

<em>&gt; &gt;deliver a 200 kg object? I'm pretty certain you can ship a piece
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of slightly subcritical Pu239 with UPS, and no one would give a

<em>&gt; &gt;damn. If it needs be, I'll just use a cartwheel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why is it that international drug cartels don't ship their product
</em><br>
<em>&gt; via UPS or FedX then?
</em><br>
<p>Besides, I can't even LIFT 200 kg, never mind deliver it anywhere....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Why are there no instances of properly done WOMD terrorism, yet?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Well, you have to be evil, irrational, wealthy and reasonably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;competent, and marginally lucky. Such traits are more or less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;independently distributed, though some of them are correlated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;There's a probability of such an event occurring, and with every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;passing year it is getting easier. So, this hasn't happened, yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Will this happen, eventually? It sure seems so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I tend to agree with you on this. Of course the first successful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorist attack with a weapon of mass destruction will probably be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's last since undoubtably the retaliation will mean complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elimination of said group.
</em><br>
<p>Which is my primary argument against John's excuses. So long as we have
<br>
ANY nukes, and so long as terrorist groups are primarily interested in
<br>
PR and not military victories, those groups will be held at bay. What
<br>
SDI provides us is greater protection by upping the  barrier to entry.
<br>
My kevlar vest makes my concealed weapon more effective in the tactical
<br>
calculation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;But I don't have to burn gigabucks on improbable scenarios, hein?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Would seem rather wasteful, if not entirely pointless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since we know the current system is &quot;not ready for primetime&quot; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree that deployment at this time is inadvisable.
</em><br>
<p>Odd that, ABM advocates agree with you at present.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Biological warfare is considerably more difficult than most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;people  believe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Well, given a choice between aerosoling VX in the subway, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;dumping MDR anthrax spores into air ducts of said subway, or doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;airburst during a large sports game, or obtaining fissibles and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;building a few kTon nuke I'd probably choose anthrax. VX would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;come a close second, nukes I wouldn't even consider, until someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;helpful would supply me with more or less useful Pu, and even then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I would have a hard time. I would be a lot more comfortable with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;vacuuming off anthrax in a suit than trying to make a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;100 kg of VX with heavy protection in the desert somewhere. Have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you ever worn heavy protection for prolonged periods of time? It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;not fun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Getting an airborne form of anthrax is not easy, the Japanese cult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aum Shinrikyo despite being technically very sophisticated failed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in it's attempts. Good luck playing with VX.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Why would a terrorist want to use ICBMs? Tell me why this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;likely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Terrorists no, rogue nations yes.
</em><br>
<p>Which are simply the geographic bases of support for terrorist groups.
<br>
Terrorists are simply 'diplomacy by other means' of nations who do not
<br>
want to engage in overt military action but are unsatisfied by
<br>
diplomatic domination by the opposition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;No, but if you're smart about it you apply your resources so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you get optimal ROI. Star wars rapidly gets ridiculously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;expensive. You have to add a zero to the officially published
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;numbers, then you're roughly in the ballpark of the real costs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would once again argue that we are not talking Star Wars here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but a limited number of ABMs.
</em><br>
<p>However, a limited system can be ramped up in only a few dozen launches
<br>
into a full system capable of interdicting  major strike.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;You mentioned China, for some strange reason, so I felt compelled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to point out that such umbrella is useless against a superpower.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;You keep harping that terrorists are nice enough to make it easy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;for you, which is somehow unconvincing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have stated a number of times that the system we were discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was not designed for either superpowers nor terrorists, but rogue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations.
</em><br>
<p>Of which, China is fully capable of being. At the moment, they have only
<br>
80 ICBMs with single warheads. While more are in the offing, their
<br>
growth in missile forces will only become threatening in another decade
<br>
or so (about the time we should have a useful system).
