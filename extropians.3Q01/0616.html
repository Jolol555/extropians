Bart Kosko, whom some of you know, has an op-ed today in the Los
<br>
Angeles Times, at
<br>
<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-000056448jul09.story?coll=la%2Dnews%2Dcomment">http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-000056448jul09.story?coll=la%2Dnews%2Dcomment</a>
<br>
(that link may not work after today):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movie &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; raises the wrong questions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about our future with computers because it gets the technology
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrong. It will be far easier to make us more like computers than to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make computers more like us.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chip implants will make that possible because chips have so many
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advantages over brains and robots.  Brains are wet and have random
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wiring. They need sugar and oxygen and sleep. They risk stroke and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;need a special cooling system for their thick skull-based housing.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...So the real question is not whether robots will replace humans
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but whether chips will replace brains.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That question may raise many ethical issues, but the answer to it is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surely yes. ...  Moore's Law ...  chips in 2020 or so will have the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raw processing power of the human brain and will forever exceed it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after that.
<br>
<p>Of course he is glossing over the tremendous difficulties involved
<br>
in interfacing a chip to the brain in such a way that it can provide
<br>
meaningful information, especially if it is going to extend our memories
<br>
so that chip-based memories and data &quot;feel&quot; normal.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant but inevitable step is not just to back up the brain but to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replace it outright. Then the music of the mind will play on a digital
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instrument with almost godlike powers. Such chip minds will have a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bit-based omniscience because they could access all knowledge and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all databases at the speed of light and never forget any of it. They
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could easily relive and edit and alter any past physical or emotional
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experience and do so with the same &quot;real&quot; intensity as when someone's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flesh first experienced it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chip minds will have a bit-based omnipotence because they could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;create entire virtual worlds simply by imagining them. Let's not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forget that the world we see &quot;out there&quot; is but an illusion in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neural circuitry of our brain's visual cortex.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even our subjective sense of time will change. We find the second a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meaningful unit of time because electrical signals travel so slowly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through our nerves. Chip time, or &quot;nanotime,&quot; will be millions or even
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;billions of times faster. One second of brain time will equal years
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or even decades of chip time. This will give chip minds a bit-based
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approximation of eternity. That also will mean a robot with a chip
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mind would find brain-based humans frozen as if they were clay models
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a time-lapsed animation.
<br>
<p>This part isn't consistent with the idea of chip implants, or even
<br>
chips replacing the brain within a biological body.  Apparently he must
<br>
be talking about an upload scenario.  Obviously you wouldn't want to
<br>
replace your brain with a chip going billions of times faster if your
<br>
body is still going about its business the same old way.
<br>
<p>I thought this inconsistency weakened the article somewhat.  While I
<br>
can understand that presenting the idea of uploading would undercut the
<br>
attractive picture he is painting, it's confusing at the end as we picture
<br>
our bodies standing around frozen while our minds zoom off into infinity.
