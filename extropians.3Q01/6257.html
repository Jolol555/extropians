<p>History Suggests Dow Set to Fall, Rebound
<br>
By Nick Olivari
<br>
<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - If history is any guide, U.S. stocks will fall when trading resumes after the devastating air attacks
<br>
on New York's World Trade Center and the Pentagon near Washington, but the long-term outlook is bullish.
<br>
<p>A check of six events in U.S. history since 1898 shows that the Dow Jones industrial average (.DJI), the oldest U.S. market
<br>
benchmark, falls in the immediate days after a history-making event such as the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but it typically
<br>
rebounds within six months.
<br>
<p>Based on historical trends ``we could see some short-term instability, but the long-term outlook is bullish,'' said Gibbons
<br>
Burke, an editor with MarketHistory.com, which provides trading and statistical data.
<br>
<p>Burke checked the performance of the Dow average, which currently includes stocks of the 30 biggest U.S. companies, after
<br>
six events affecting U.S. interests since 1898.
<br>
<p>Those events were: the sinking of the U.S. battleship Maine on Feb. 15, 1898; the sinking of the passenger ship the
<br>
Lusitania on May 7, 1915; the attack on the Pearl Harbor naval base on Dec. 7, 1941; the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on Aug.
<br>
2, 1990; the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York on Feb. 26, 1993; and the bombing of federal offices in Oklahoma
<br>
on April 19, 1995.
<br>
<p>A day after the event, the Dow Jones industrial average was down an average of 1.9 percent, Burke said. One week later, the
<br>
Dow average had dropped by 3 percent.
<br>
<p>But then the average typically began to turn around, according to Burke.
<br>
<p>Two weeks after an attack or bombing, the index was down an average 2.1 percent, and within a month it was down just 1.6
<br>
percent.
<br>
<p>After six months, the Dow industrials were up an average 11.3 percent, and a year from the watershed event the benchmark had
<br>
gained 18.4 percent.
<br>
<p>``In the near term, events like this cause near-term fear, panic, and economic disruption but that is when market bottoms
<br>
are formed,'' said Tim Ghriskey, head of Ghriskey Capital Partners, a money management firm for wealthy individuals. ``And
<br>
usually a year later we have stronger and much higher financial markets as economic stability and investors return.''
<br>
<p>At the two-year mark, the Dow industrials were up an average 30.7 percent; at three years up by 50.4 percent; and after five
<br>
years up by 82.2 percent.
<br>
<p>U.S. stocks market remained closed for a second day on Wednesday, the first time the New York Stock Exchange has closed for
<br>
two consecutive days since the end of World War II.
<br>
<p>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt said that he expected U.S. financial markets to open on
<br>
Thursday.
<br>
<p>``It is our hope and expectation that the markets will resume operation tomorrow or as soon as tomorrow but I believe it
<br>
will be tomorrow,'' Pitt, whose agency regulates the U.S. stock markets, said on CBS's Early Show.
