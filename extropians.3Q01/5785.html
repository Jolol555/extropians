<p>I had no idea that it was an acknowledged mission of search

engines to understand what constitutes &quot;garbage information&quot; in
<br>
your eyes and the eyes of whatever user is making the search and
<br>
filter it out.  It sounds like a wonderful goal but I didn't
<br>
know it was part of search requirements per se.  It would be
<br>
nice to have search capabilities that could automagically
<br>
separate sheep from goats and pre-digest all that information
<br>
for you and whisper derived nuggests of wisdom into your ear but
<br>
I disagree it is a failure of search engines that they do no
<br>
already deliver such miracles.
