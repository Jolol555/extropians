<p>Well, Damien, those technologies are likely to come to pass
<br>
(to allow the growth of babies outside the womb) -- so if you
<br>
keep the embryos frozen long enough you could &quot;birth&quot; them
<br>
someday without the requirement that someone &quot;bear&quot; them.
<br>
[Google turns up more than 1000 hits for &quot;artificial womb&quot;.]
<br>
<p>And of course, you have probably figured out that my long
<br>
term forecasts include the ability for the de novo design
<br>
of the chromosomes that would manufacture a human.  All of
<br>
this leads to the fact that we can't dispose of phosphoramidite
<br>
reagents used in DNA synthesis because they too have the
<br>
possibility of `potential life'.
<br>
<p>There is a great cartoon in the making here, as the scientist
<br>
goes to put the frozen embryo into the incinerator (because
<br>
he has run out of freezer space) and the cells are saying,
<br>
&quot;But we're not dead yet&quot; and then as he begins to shave
<br>
himself the next morning and his skin cells are slowly
<br>
spiraling down into in the sink drain, they are screaming,
<br>
&quot;We're not dead yet either!&quot;...
<br>
<p>Lets all stand up for DNA rights NOW!...
<br>
<p>There's an interesting court case you could try to set up
<br>
where you take your frozen embryos to someplace where the
<br>
local DA is a religious conservative and then you advertise
<br>
in the paper offering free coffee and doughnuts for those people
<br>
who want to watch you incinerate the embryos with a flame
<br>
thrower across from the Church parking lot on Sunday morning...
<br>
<p>Hmmmmm.... What about RoboWars in which the goal is to find
<br>
the most ghastly way to dispose of the embryos...
<br>
<p>I think I need to get out more...
