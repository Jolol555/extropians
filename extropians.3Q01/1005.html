Just received this message from a friend.  I haven't had a chance to read 
<br>
the report yet, but I thought several of you might be interested in what 
<br>
Cato has to say.
<br>
<p>------
<br>
Cato has just published an account of the causes.  It is awesomely
<br>
comprehensive.
<br>
<p>Altered some of my views; may aid yours too.  Quotes from the summary:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtually all the increase in wholesale prices can be explained by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;increases in production costs and overall scarcity. While there is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;some evidence of the existence of excessive generator &quot;market power&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(created not by the unfettered exercise of free markets but by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;poorly conceived regulation), it is relatively minor and responsible
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for only a small fraction of the price spike, if it exists at all.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find little evidence to support the argument that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;environmentalists are primarily to blame for the crisis. We likewise
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;are unconvinced that, had the state allowed utilities to enter into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;long-term contracts with generators, the crisis could have been
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;either averted or made less severe.
