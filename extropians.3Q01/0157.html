Not yer daddy's solar system anymore. Gerard K. O'neil would have been stoked 
<br>
on this one.

LOS ANGELES (June 3) - Astronomers announced Monday they have discovered an 
<br>
icy body that rivals Pluto's moon in size and hints that other planets may 
<br>
lurk within the far reaches of our solar system. 
<br>
<p>The object, 2001 KX76, appears to be between 595 and 788 miles across, making 
<br>
it larger than any known asteroid and, perhaps, even Pluto's moon Charon. 
<br>
Charon is estimated to be 744 miles in diameter. 
<br>
<p>A team of astronomers used the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in 
<br>
Chile to find the object in images taken on May 22. It orbits the sun at a 
<br>
distance of about 4 billion miles in the Kuiper Belt of objects beyond 
<br>
Neptune. 
<br>
<p>The new object apparently trumps in size all other known objects beyond the 
<br>
orbit of Neptune, except Pluto itself. 
<br>
<p>Astronomers spotted the first Kuiper Belt object in 1992. Billions more are 
<br>
thought to exist, including some 70,000 at least 60 miles across. They are by 
<br>
far the most abundant type of large objects in the solar system. 
<br>
<p>``The excitement of this is that it's a new frontier: There is this region in 
<br>
the solar system beyond Neptune that is populated with a large number of 
<br>
objects and we have no idea of what we may ultimately discover out there,'' 
<br>
said Robert Millis, director of the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz. 
<br>
<p>Astronomers from the observatory, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
<br>
and the Large Binocular Telescope Observatory found 2001 KX76 as part of a 
<br>
survey of Kuiper Belt objects sponsored by NASA. 
<br>
<p>Kuiper Belt objects are important because scientists believe they represent, 
<br>
preserved by the deep freeze of space, pristine remnants of the disk from 
<br>
which the solar system was created. The belt is also believed to be the 
<br>
source of the comets that pass close to the sun. 
<br>
<p>Scientists say further probing of the Kuiper Belt could turn up more large 
<br>
objects, including bodies that may rival Pluto in size. The ninth planet is 
<br>
about 1,400 miles across. 
<br>
<p>``The expectation has been for the last few years that we would find some 
<br>
objects of Pluto's size and perhaps larger than Pluto. The question now is 
<br>
when these objects will be picked up,'' said David Jewitt, a University of 
<br>
Hawaii professor who, with Jane Luu, discovered the first Kuiper Belt object 
<br>
less than a decade ago. 
<br>
<p>Further observations of 2001 KX76 should provide better estimates of its 
<br>
size.
