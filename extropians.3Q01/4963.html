Mike said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The problem is that science (specifically sociobiology) continues to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prove these theorists wrong.
</em><br>
<p>I *think* Mike meant theorists who deny that there are objective moral
<br>
properties. Sociobiology does no such thing. At the most, it shows that
<br>
there is a &quot;human nature&quot; in the sense that there is a tendency for
<br>
different kinds of human beings (eg sexes, ages) to act in certain ways in
<br>
certain environments, and that these tendencies are genetically hard-wired
<br>
into us by the experience of our ancestors in the evolutionary environments.
<br>
That is an interesting datum, but it goes nowhere near to establishing the
<br>
existence of objective moral properties. Indeed, there are respectable
<br>
arguments that it actually reinforces subjectivist theories of ethics: moral
<br>
rules are just subjective to our evolutionary coding.
<br>
<p>Mike would also be familiar the idea that we have an incentive to *change*
<br>
our inherited evolutionary coding because it gives us dispositions that may
<br>
have increased our inclusive fitness in the evolutionary environment but are
<br>
arguably detrimental to our well-being in modern, high-technology
<br>
environments. Evolution, of course, does not care about an organism's
<br>
well-being but only about its inclusive fitness.
<br>
<p>Peter Singer has a very good book on the relationship between
<br>
sociobiological claims and ethics. IIRC correctly its title is something
<br>
like _The Expanding Circle_. He's come back to this issue a lot in his
<br>
recent work.
