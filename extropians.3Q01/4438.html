</em><br>
<em>&gt; Point understood.  But from where I sit we are already &quot;extinct&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we do not conquer death and/or fail to make cryonics work

</em><br>
<p>But I personally am not the species, am not the whole of
<br>
humanity. Yet I do not think or act only for the preserverance
<br>
of myself.  &quot;We&quot; are not extinct if any one of us dies any more
<br>
the body is dead when a cell dies.  
<br>
<p>But I think I take your point generally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As long as there is freedom then those who don't see cryonics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as viable have no guilt whatsoever. Honest opinion is not guilt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; producing. Forcing others to forego their own opinions is cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for guilt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is that many people have been brain-washed into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believing that there is a &quot;magical&quot; solution.  That false
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge creates a false sense of security that means they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not take the effort to seriously investigate cryonics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To preserve their world view, they treat it with skepticism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if not outright revulsion.  If there is &quot;guilt&quot; here it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably lies in the hands of people who distribute historical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stories for salvation to people incapable of giving &quot;informed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consent&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe that skepticism concerning cryonics is primarily
<br>
to preserve any particular world view.  At least it is not in my
<br>
own case.  
<br>
<p>There are many stories for salvation.  Cryonics is one of them. 
<br>
Do you think most people can honestly evaluate cryonics?  Or do
<br>
I misunderstand whaty you mean by &quot;informed consent&quot; and perhaps
<br>
what weight you give to it?
<br>
<p>For most people being saved from death by cryonics and/or
<br>
nanomedicine is &quot;magic&quot;.  But which magic offers the most in
<br>
reality? Which magic offers the most to the entire person and
<br>
leads to the most good?  Which magic has what effects on entire
<br>
peoples?  Simply not dying is a wonderful, powerful &quot;magic&quot;. 
<br>
But it is not the full solution.  
<br>
<p>Until now we could not do much about the seeming inevitability
<br>
of death.  We cannot yet do a lot but we have some small hopeful
<br>
means such as cryonics.  But until the first cryonaut is
<br>
successfully revived this is no more sure a means than the
<br>
ancient Egytian rituals of mummification.  It is what we believe
<br>
is the most likely to preserve our beloved self within the
<br>
context of the best of our current knowledge.
