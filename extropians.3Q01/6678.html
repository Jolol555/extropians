<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arabia and Kuwait than to ally with Israel.
</em><br>
<p>They are not reliable allies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Israel is able to defend itself quite nicely.
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe it's ever had to defend itself without US support.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why would all of the Persian Gulf region countries stop selling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oil unless we really, really pissed them off?
</em><br>
<p>They wouldn't have to merely stop. They could create major problems by
<br>
simply raising prices. Bin Laden has stated in a 1997 interview with ABC
<br>
news that it is his intent, should he ever gain the power to do so, to raise
<br>
the price of oil substantially.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They _need_ to sell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us oil.  They haven't got anything else.  We can avoid pissing them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off by leaving well enough alone.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so. Have a listen to this 1998 BBC interview with bin Laden.
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/middle_east/newsid_242000/242460.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/middle_east/newsid_242000/242460.stm</a>
<br>
To satisfy him, all Jews and Americans would have to be removed from the
<br>
middle east, and the terrorism will continue until this happens or until he
<br>
and his henchmen are stopped. If the US were to abandon Israel, the US would
<br>
have no forward staging area anywhere near enough the middle east oil fields
<br>
to maintain any sort of miliary presence there. Incidentally, bin Laden is
<br>
asked in this interview if he has nuclear and biological weapons. His answer
<br>
is interesting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  we've got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the other goods they want -- though they would've milked our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dependence for every political drop they could get.
</em><br>
<p>With people like bin Laden and his followers, I don't think the goods we
<br>
have are all that important. Bin Laden comes from a wealthy family,
<br>
inherited $300 million, much of which he still controls. If you can find it,
<br>
read the transcript of the 1997 ABC interview with him. He comes across as
<br>
being after power rather than money.
