<p><p><em>&gt; From: Olga Bourlin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Was Bertie intolerant?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The world at the present day stands in need of two kinds of things. On
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; one hand, organization - political organization for the elimination of
</em><br>
wars,
<br>
<em>&gt; economic organization to enable men to work productively, especially in
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; countries that have been devastated by war, educational organization to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate a sane internationalism. On the other hand it needs certain moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualities the qualities which have been advocated by moralists for many
</em><br>
ages,
<br>
<em>&gt; but hitherto with little success. The qualities most needed are charity
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; TOLERANCE, not some form of fanatical faith such as is offered to us by
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; various rampant isms. I think these two aims, the organizational and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical, are closely interwoven; given either the other would soon follow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But, in effect, if the world is to move in the right direction it will
</em><br>
have to
<br>
<em>&gt; move simultaneously in both respects. There will have to be a gradual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lessening of the evil passions which are the natural aftermath of war, and
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; gradual increase of the organizations by means of which mankind can bring
</em><br>
each
<br>
<em>&gt; other mutual help. There will have to be a realization at once
</em><br>
intellectual
<br>
<em>&gt; and moral that we are all one family, and that the happiness of no one
</em><br>
branch
<br>
<em>&gt; of this family can be built securely upon the ruin of another. At the
</em><br>
present
<br>
<em>&gt; time, moral defects stand in the way of clear thinking, and muddled
</em><br>
thinking
<br>
<em>&gt; encourages moral defects. Perhaps, though I scarcely dare to hope it, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hydrogen bomb will terrify mankind into sanity and tolerance. If this
</em><br>
should
<br>
<em>&gt; happen we shall have reason to bless its inventors.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --Bertie, _Unpopular Essays_, 1951 p.165
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [emphasis added]
</em><br>
<p>That was a rhetorical question, of course.  But from what I've read, Bertie
<br>
was not very respectful or tolerant of woo woo (superstition in all its
<br>
guises), and that was to his credit.
<br>
<p>I respect anyone's right to woo woo, too, but I think it's koo koo ...
