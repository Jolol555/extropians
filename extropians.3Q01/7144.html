<em>&gt; As a reminder, here are the Extropian Principles as currently defined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Max More, from <a href="http://www.extropy.com/extprn3.htm">http://www.extropy.com/extprn3.htm</a>:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Perpetual Progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Self-Transformation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. Practical Optimism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. Intelligent Technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5. Open Society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6. Self-Direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 7. Rational Thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of these, I think Open Society and Self-Direction are the most relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to understanding the current crisis.  The Arab nations lack openness, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are generally not able to direct their own lives, especially women.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the self-direction part is rather variable. The main problem might
<br>
be simply that many societies are so consensus-driven that
<br>
self-direction becomes hard. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is difficult to maintain faith in Perpetual Progress and Practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Optimism in the immediate aftermath of the attacks.  Perhaps with time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and perspective we will be able to adopt a more hopeful attitude.
</em><br>
<p>To put it bluntly, the attacks were a minuscule blip in the big picture.
<br>
In a way this is terribly sad - that human lives can be so irrelevant -
<br>
and also comforting - life goes on. The attacks will have long
<br>
consequences, but they hardly look like they can stop perpetual progress
<br>
(unless we all laze back and let them). 
<br>
<p>Practical optimism is not something you lose faith in - it is something
<br>
you do. A merely optimistic person might lose faith in his optimism, but
<br>
when you know your and others happiness is something *you* create, then
<br>
even the greatest disasters become merely unwanted challenges. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The idea of Intelligent Technology has prompted a number of suggestions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of them not very practical.  I think part of the problem is that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are thinking of how to apply IT to warfare.  But the military is already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expert in that.  I think we do better taking a longer term perspective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and thinking about how to open up these societies and bring them into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a more Extropian worldview.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. Intelligent technology has even more civilian and cultural uses
<br>
than military. And I would include economics in the term. 
<br>
<p>As a general rule, trade is an excellent way of spreading/creating not
<br>
just wealth, but also ideas and peace. When you trade with someone,
<br>
getting into a fight with him is against your self interest, and the
<br>
more nations and groups trade and communicate with each other the less
<br>
likely they are to get into war with each other. Also, this trade allows
<br>
ideas to sneak through old cultural barriers, making people question
<br>
unworkable traditions and prejudices. Help set up a free press that
<br>
cannot be easily stopped in the Middle East, and things will move even
<br>
faster. It will still take more time than we like, but it needs to be
<br>
done.
