Superbly stated. How does a comet strike or a sudden flourish in geophysical 
<br>
phenomena establish Darwinian adaptability? Speilberg probably didn't write 
<br>
the script for Jurassic Park, but Michael Crighton surely assisted with, in 
<br>
his writing of the scripts for Jurassic Park 1, as well as writing both 
<br>
books.  Terrified of intelligent computers is tantamount to be terrified of  
<br>
intelligence itself. Shall we fore-go scientific advances and slag down in 
<br>
the luddite sludge? This to is a receipe' for disaster too. Witness 
<br>
the&quot;vanished cultures&quot; in North America and East Asia due to the transforming 
<br>
of rich soils to laterite (depleted) soils because of over-harvesting and 
<br>
grazing. Better technologies would have off-set these problems.

<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; Whether or not dinosaurs &quot;had their chance&quot; doesn't correlate in any 
<br>
rational
<br>
&nbsp;way to the issue of responsibility in connection with bringing them back,
<br>
&nbsp;because there may be other factors involved in bringing them back (such as 
<br>
the
<br>
&nbsp;possibility of acquiring important knowledge concerning the actual causes of
<br>
&nbsp;dinosaur extinction). So, first of all, we don't know for sure if they _did_
<br>
&nbsp;have their chance. As for the dodo bird, we know it never had a chance, once
<br>
&nbsp;humans invaded the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, so if Spielberg
<br>
&nbsp;equates the responsibility of bringing back extinct species with the chance
<br>
&nbsp;they had for survival, then of course he would conclude that it would be
<br>
&nbsp;responsible to bring back the dodo.
