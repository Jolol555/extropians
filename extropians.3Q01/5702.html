<em>&gt; If &quot;intelligence&quot; is pure logic, then a perfect intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would always operate from first principles and observed fact, and never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from pre-computed stored knowledge, which you think of as &quot;cheating.&quot; In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the real world, intelligence is really the ability to efficiently access
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and manipulate the information you have stored. This ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly pick the correct starting points in the knowledge base minimizes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the amount of reasoning you need to do.
</em><br>
<p>OTOH, the inability to operate from first principles and observed facts, using
<br>
instead pre-computed stored knowledge, is not human-competitive cognition of
<br>
the highest caliber. It's merely information retrieval, AKA memory. Machines
<br>
that can actually solve real problems autonomously do in fact demonstrate
<br>
genuine intelligence, which qualifies them as living entities AFAIC.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I really want is a &quot;perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; search engine&quot; that will deliver relevant information and which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly adaptive to current context. Such a tool would allow me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason from a huge knowledge base.
</em><br>
<p>You're not the only one who really wants such an engine. Many of us have
<br>
wanted such a device for decades.

<p>Research issues in context-aware retrieval: needs of the Matcher-library

ABSTRACT
<br>
The set of Java classes used by the Context Matcher needs to be made available
<br>
to the user (in this case not the end-user but the researcher who wants to
<br>
test retrieval strategies) both within the Matcher itself, in order to allow
<br>
the user to plug in specially tailored scoring algorithms, and in pre- and
<br>
post-processors which the user may want to attach to the Matcher. This paper
<br>
looks at some sample tasks that the user might want to perform, in order to
<br>
show what facilities should ideally be available in the Java classes.

<p>ADMIRE: An Adaptive Data Model for Meta Search Engines

<br>
ABSTRACT
<br>
Considering the diversity among search engines, efficient integration of them
<br>
is an important but difficult job. It is essential to provide a data model
<br>
that can provide a detailed description of the query capabilities of
<br>
heterogeneous search engines. By means of this model, the meta-searcher can
<br>
map users' queries into specific sources more accurately, and it can achieve
<br>
good precision and recall. Moreover, it will benefit the selection of target
<br>
source and computing priority. Because new search engines emerge frequently
<br>
and old ones are updated when their function and content change, the data
<br>
model needs good adaptivity and scalability to keep in step with the rapidly
<br>
developing WWW. This paper gives a formal description of the query
<br>
capabilities of heterogeneous search engines and an algorithm for mapping a
<br>
query from a general mediator format into the specific wrapper format of a
<br>
specific search engine. Compared with related work, the special features of
<br>
our work are that we focus more on the constraint of/between the terms,
<br>
attribute order, and the impact of logical operator restraints. The
<br>
contribution of our work is that we offer a data model that is both expressive
<br>
enough to meticulously describe the query capabilities of current WWW search
<br>
engines and flexible enough to integrate them efficiently.

<p>Webmind, GlobalBrain, and Semantic Web projects seek related search and

retrieval power.

Meanwhile, google does better than anything that existed five years ago.
