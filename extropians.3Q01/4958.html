Mike said
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Aw, c'mon, Russell. If certain unnamed, self declared 'liberals' around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here are going to continue to claim that I, and others, are somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'racist', then there is no reason I cannot be as loose in my definitions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when I describe those who espouse authoritarian policies.
</em><br>
<p><p>Fair go, Mike. Two wrongs don't make a vicious right-wing totalitarian.
<br>
(BTW, you'll note that *I've* never called you a racist or anything remotely
<br>
like it, despite my being one of those horrible left-liberals in the
<br>
American parlance; admittedly, I also seem to be a border-line libertarian,
<br>
but I think the real point is that I like to avoid inaccurate, emotive
<br>
name-calling).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Whether their concerns are based on fascist political theory or not is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;immaterial. How they wish to implement the prescriptions for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concerns is, in fact, based on fascist political theory, and how they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conduct their campaigns in the streets with propaganda, disinformation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and terror is, in fact, based on fascist political theory. Those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;insist you can only judge someone by their intent, and not their acts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are simply espousing another form of justifying means by the ends.
</em><br>
<p>Undistributed middle:
<br>
<p>(1) All fascists use propaganda, disinformation and terror
<br>
(2) Leon Kass uses propaganda, disinformation and terror
<br>
Conclusion: Leon Kass is a fascist.
<br>
<p>Of course, (2) isn't even true. Kass at least attempts to debate rationally,
<br>
however irrationalist I actually think his arguments are. Overall, it would
<br>
be unfair to call his material &quot;propaganda&quot;. I think the same applies to
<br>
&quot;disinformation&quot;; I don't think there's a lot of attempt to spread false
<br>
&quot;facts&quot;. And &quot;terror&quot; would be a great exaggeration of his wish to invoke
<br>
the coercive power of the state to enforce his religious morality.
<br>
<p>However, I now understand that you weren't so much thinking about people
<br>
like, say, Kass, Margaret Somerville and Bill Joy (to take a bit of spectrum
<br>
of neo-Luddite thinkers) when you mentioned &quot;luddites&quot;. If you had
<br>
anti-globalisation protesters in mind, I see your point, though it still has
<br>
the effect that any irrationalist revolutionary type who uses force becomes
<br>
a &quot;fascist&quot;. I'd rather stick with the idea that fascism is a virulent
<br>
sub-set of totalitarian thinking with some nasty memes all its own. It is
<br>
not fair to brand even these demonstrators as fascists unless they exhibit
<br>
those particular memes. Avoid guilt by association.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Refusing to call a spade a spade aids in their disinformation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;propaganda, and lends them an undeserved legitimacy.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it can. I hope you see my point that it would be very silly and
<br>
counter-productive to call someone like Bill Joy or even Leon Kass a
<br>
fascist. As for the anti-globalisation demonstrators, I am happy to describe
<br>
them accurately (calling a spade a spade), but an accurate description would
<br>
not incude the word &quot;fascist&quot;.
<br>
<p>Cheers
<br>
<p>Russell
