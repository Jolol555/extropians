<p>Lee Corbin said
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More importantly, some maps are so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detailed that they explicitly denote some object or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship in the real world. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This last claim is very controversial
</em><br>
<p>Since there can be no controversy about the existence of
<br>
detailed maps, you must mean 'intrinsically', not 'explicitly'. 
<br>
<p>But symbols which are isomorphic to their referents still have 
<br>
their meaning only by convention. If two rocks have similar shapes 
<br>
it doesn't mean that one refers to the other... What isomorphisms
<br>
do is make the 'decoding' of symbols easier, by making it 
<br>
systematic. 
<br>
<p>The closest thing to a 'natural symbol' would have to be
<br>
some phenomenon which one learns to interpret as an indicator
<br>
of another phenomenon: &quot;Where there's smoke, there's fire.&quot;
<br>
The interpretation of language is just an instance of this:
<br>
&quot;Where there's symbols, there's communicative intent.&quot; 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My question: what about an axiom system? Are all the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meanings (as in symbolic logic) only conventional? How 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does this relate to Godel's theorem? 
</em><br>
<p>Of course, my answer is going to be: yes, all the meanings
<br>
are conventional. But there *is* structure, so therefore
<br>
there is some sort of systematic mapping present. The real
<br>
question is, onto what? If it's onto 'mathematical or
<br>
logical facts', then you have to be some sort of realist
<br>
about the number two, the property of noncontradiction, 
<br>
and so on. If not (if you want to be a nominalist materialist,
<br>
for example), then it seems like you have to take the road 
<br>
of formalism... axiom systems are just games with rules,
<br>
and aren't actually about anything.
