<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Not such a trick at all.  Happens constantly.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; Racists are a subset of discriminators.
</em><br>
<p>This is the key, would the set &quot;racist&quot; a subset of &quot;discriminators&quot; or not.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Well... you are using two different definitions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discriminate here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From Random House Webster's College dictionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (copyright 1999):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Discriminate:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) to make a distinction in favor of or against a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person on the basis of the group or class to which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that person belongs, rather than according to merit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) to note or observe a difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1 and 2 are different usages, you are acting as if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are identical... they aren't.
</em><br>
<p>Note that definition 1 is a subset of definition 2. This means that there
<br>
can be discrimination without racism. I can discriminate and say I only want
<br>
people that are not blind driving my trucks. I am discriminating against a
<br>
person on the basis of a group they belong to (the blind). This falls under
<br>
definition 1 but I cant imagine anyone having a problem with this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is my point. The black cop using racial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; profiling COULD think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; blacks are genetically superior to whites, yet still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; statistically they commit more crime. He would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discriminating... NOT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; racist (unless you include discrimination in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; definition of racism which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is a circular loop of reasoning).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As long as he wasn't USING racial profiling, he could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly think that way and not be acting racist...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however the first time he stops a black person for no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other reason than he IS black he has then acted racist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against blacks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Racial profiling is racist.  Making true statistical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements based on race isn't racist... actions based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on those statistics and aimed at individuals is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racist.
</em><br>
<p>Why is action based on real numbers racist? The numbers are a reflection of
<br>
reality. If my bank account numbers show that I am out of money, I modify my
<br>
behavior to account for this. As far as racial profiling, black cops do this
<br>
as well as white cops. Racial profiling has a basis in reality and will be
<br>
used no matter what the PC spin is coming from city hall.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is this making sense yet?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Discriminating (def 1.) based on race IS racist. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Based on sex it is sexist, based on sexual orientation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is heterosexist.
</em><br>
<p>This is a circular argument. Discrimination based on race is racist. Racism
<br>
is discrimination based on race. This doesn't explain &quot;good discrimination&quot;
<br>
(my blind truck driver) from bad and why.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Discriminating (def 2.) is simply acknowledging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality no matter what traits or characteristics you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are observing.
</em><br>
<p>As long as you don't take any actions? What if I own Marlboro cigarettes,
<br>
and I do research that shows that if I use a black female to advertise
<br>
Marlboro cigarettes, that my profits will fall and that I will lose money?
<br>
What about my responsibility to my stockholders? What would it even
<br>
accomplish to do such a thing besides lose money (and for what cause). So,
<br>
if I take action based on race, then I'm racist, although if I don't take
<br>
action, I cause suffering to many others (stockholders, company employees,
<br>
etc... some probably black too).
<br>
<p>Also, if I don't use a black female, then I'm racist, but cant the same be
<br>
said for a white female? How about a female Muslim. A male Hindu. So if I
<br>
use a white male, I discriminate against them all, but the inverse isn't
<br>
true?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Racists (and their apologists) tend to conflate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitions 1 and 2.
</em><br>
<p>This is an understatement of galactic magnitude. If I thought everyone's
<br>
email client could handle it, I would change the font to size 50 point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have a hard time believing that there would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone on THIS list arguing in favor of racial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profiling.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Loree
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like argument through intimidation, I wouldn't think that this
<br>
statement would cause very many people to shy away from this topic. I don't
<br>
have a problem with racial profiling, remember, it works both ways. If your
<br>
looking for white collar or computer banking crime, there's probably a
<br>
greater chance of it being a white guy then black (note: I didn't say this
<br>
was definitive, I'm talking averages here).
