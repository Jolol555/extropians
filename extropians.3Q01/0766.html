<em> &gt; &gt; How old am I?  Old enough to vote.  Anything else is on a need-to-know
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; basis, and you don't need to know.  But to my mind, the worry is whether
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; my *grandparents* make it to the Singularity.  I seriously doubt that even
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; the old fogeys among us will miss the train.  If you're under forty, you
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; essentially have a cast-iron guarantee that you won't die of old age.  You
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; may be hit by a truck, die of a premature heart attack at fifty, or have
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; an artery eaten by goo, but you won't die of old age.  Hope this cheers
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; y'all up.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I really don't see this; really, really not. It just doesn't sound plausible
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to be so absolute about this; it begins to seem like an issue of faith in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; technology, in everything working out ok. Consider even just the trial and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; error is-this-working timescales...
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Anyone want to roll out some numerical- and factual- based arguments on one
</em><br>
<em> &gt; side or the other?
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<p>If I remember correctly, in The Alcor Adventure video Linda Chamberlain put the timeline where major killers(heart disease, cancer, etc.) are stopped at a mere ten years from now.
<br>
<p>I was rather taken aback by this proclamation.  I hope it turns out to be true.  My parents were skeptical to say the least when they viewed the video.  
<br>
<p>So, if I just make it to the 200th anniversary of the L.D.S. church then I will be in the age of indefinite lifespan for everyone!  It should make for interesting conversation in General Conference.
<br>
<p>And when will a &quot;heartache cure&quot; be developed?  I need a high dosage of it right now to warm the ice water which permeates my brain and blood.  I'm just not a drinker by nature...
