<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Childcare should be provided by the parents, not the government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;In your opinion, who should provide for schools - the parents, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;well? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Absolutely, why should non-parents foot the bill?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Parents who parent do in fact pay for their own childrens'
<br>
education, and then soldier on to pay the taxes that
<br>
provide for the twelve years' warehousing and
<br>
indoctrination that the hinds' get gets.
<br>
The notion that state schools benefit all segments of
<br>
society because they provide universal literacy, knowledge
<br>
of the historical basis of the culture, and understanding
<br>
of the mechanisms of citizen participation may have had
<br>
some past relation with reality but these don't be the
<br>
days.
