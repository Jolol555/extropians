</em><br>
<p>Agree. Will add that most are also designed with a pit that is not detonable unless
<br>
tritium gas at pressure is present in the pit prior to compression. This tritium
<br>
boosting gets you more bang for your fissile mass, less fallout and a safeguard;
<br>
basically a triple weaponology win if you have the tech in the first place.
<br>
<p>I speculate that this was the one remaining safeguard that was not present in the
<br>
famous case of the downed US warhead that had n-1 of its n (7? 8?) safeguards tripped.
<br>
<p>As for the codes: word is that at least some KGB theater level officers had the go codes
<br>
for the manpack nukes the Spetsnaz were holding. How many? Who knows?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is much easier to purify plutonium from decayed nuclear ashes and make
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Umm, I think gun==U. As far as I recall Pu self-heats too much for a gun device to be 
<br>
very manageable. All those different crystalline phases get weird fast. IIRC, even a 
<br>
hemisphere of Pu gets too hot unless you are doing tricks with high compression and T boosting.
<br>
<p>But I'm not absolutely sure about all Pu isotopes.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Absolutely agree that you can make weapons out of non-weapons-grade material.
<br>
&quot;Plan C&quot; is, of course, to just knavishly make a big mess with a subcritical flash + plume.
<br>
Probably works as a WOMT, if not a WOMD.
