I don't like to interspace remarks, reply interactively, or do line by
<br>
line responses. I prefer an essay format either wholly before or
<br>
following what the other person wrote.
<br>
<p>To answer the first question, I am not certain of anything. What I am
<br>
using is a particular metaphysical model, just as you use a metaphysical
<br>
model. All models are inherently circular and speak in terms of
<br>
themselves, only. The most a person can hope for is that a model
<br>
maintain logical consistency and not break down when called upon for
<br>
answers.
<br>
<p>In my opinion reality-based models break down. Nonreality-based models
<br>
are more dynamic and do not break down. Each offers a brand of truth.
<br>
Reality models are fine so long as a person is satisfied with the narrow
<br>
band of truth they provide.
<br>
<p>For the second question I do not know there is a &quot;we&quot;. There is a &quot;we&quot;
<br>
only as much as I want there to be a &quot;we&quot; and seek out that manner of
<br>
communication. As I've said recently here, knowledge is driven by
<br>
valuation and choice. So I choose to maintain the idea there is a &quot;we&quot;
<br>
because it satisfies me. Sometimes I choose to think only of myself,
<br>
too, so &quot;we&quot; at those times is not very significant.

<em>&gt;&gt; I will try to answer your question better. Modern men evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; technologically from cave men. Mental affluence and cognition were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; required to do that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Good start; thanks.  What's to keep you from quoting specifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;---the way most people do here---what question it is that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are addressing?  See how I intersperse your remarks with mine?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I didn't disagree with the rest of your post.  Like the above, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;related to what is objectively the case, e.g., &quot;modern [people] evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;...from cave men [huntergatherers]&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But here are my questions again, now numbered for your easy convenience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1. Why are you more certain that you live in a world of language,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   objectification, and mental abstractions, than you live in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   world of earth, air, fire, and water?  (Such things as language
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   could not exist were they not evolved in matter creatures, nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   could mental abstractions.  You are choosing to build up your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   model of what the world is on top of very shaky ideas that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   can't even know that other people possess, because you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   even know that there are other people.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2. How do you know that there is a &quot;we&quot;?  (I suggest that your inference
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   that there are other people is much weaker than your inference that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   there is a 3-D world outside your skin.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lee
