<p>The yield of anthrax spores is low, but harvesting it is not rocket

science, it's just a little vacuum cleaner with a microfilter baggie.
<br>
Their shelf life is impressive, so all you need is scaling up, and/or
<br>
patience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe you're refering to their Sarin attack on the subway,

</em><br>
<p>Yes.

<p><em>&gt; I was only refering to the resources a dictator has versus the

</em><br>
<p>True, but would he risk his precious nukes by using SCUDS or similiar as
<br>
delivery vehicles? Would he risk having the major targets of his country
<br>
to be rapidly obliterated, thus removing his power basis? It might happen,
<br>
but it doesn't seem likely. I'd rather suspect small or medium groups of
<br>
fanatics doing it, who have typically more limited resources, and no
<br>
specific physical location, and who would gain most by acting in stealth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; China is going to increase it's arsenal regardless, smaller nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't have the resources.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure China would, and it would seem that it would be the polite
<br>
thing to do to not do something which will provoke them into ramping up.
<br>
If they start ramping up, you can always do it yourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No U.S. government is going to do this, by the way this is the ICBM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario. ;)
</em><br>
<p>No, shelters are useful against fallout, and also against biological and
<br>
chemical agents, which are typically slow enough to propagate to be
<br>
catched by sniffers.
<br>
<p>And, of course, shelters will be very useful if somebody really decides to
<br>
nuke you the ICBM way, or if there's a medium space rock heading your way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the event of an ICBM attack you think shelters are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective/ less expensive while I think that ABM's are the better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice. (actually I'd like both but can't afford it).
</em><br>
<p>We can't afford both, so we have to limit ourselves to the option
<br>
providing optimum ROI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You think a suitcase nuke or megatruck bomb is more likely, but in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this case I think shelters are useless.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but fallout, chem and bio will do nicely, and of course if you have
<br>
them, you'll have the ICBM delivery option covered, too.
