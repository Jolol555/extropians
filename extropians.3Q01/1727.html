<p>&lt;&lt; Congratulations, you've categorically identified the essential question 
<br>
dodged
<br>
&nbsp;by proponents of &quot;uploading.&quot; Why replicate brains so estranged from reality
<br>
&nbsp;they believe themselves somehow unique.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Stay hungry,
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;--J. R. &gt;&gt;
<br>
Its not if they believe themselves unique so much as to whether the situation 
<br>
is satisfying to the uploaded &quot;personality&quot; and &quot;its&quot; living cohorts. If 
<br>
there is a live body still walking around, attending to business, fretting 
<br>
about its &quot;uploaded&quot; clone; then by my way of thinking, this is wholly, 
<br>
unsatisfactory.  If, on the other hand, there is a human corpse at the end of 
<br>
the procedure, and an uploaded, personality, of what was that human being, 
<br>
then it could be satisfactory, indeed. It then comes down to what the new set 
<br>
of programs that comprise the newly, loaded, personality, feel, and think, 
<br>
about their experiences.
<br>
<p>A Turing test, in this situation would not suffice, if the physical children 
<br>
of the deceased, parent, who was uploaded, came to state, &quot;Hey, after a month 
<br>
of speaking to Her (uploaded person) We, her children, know this isn't really 
<br>
our Mom-she must've died during the upload operation.&quot;  If the &quot;Mom&quot; proggie 
<br>
doesn't seem to react and interact properly, this will confirm that the 
<br>
upload technology is insufficient.
<br>
<p>Kurzweil, in Spiritual Machines, seems unshakably confident that this 
<br>
technology will be achieved, during the 21st century, which would be 
<br>
wonderful if such a successful technology did occur that soon. I, take a much 
<br>
more gradualist, approach, and suspect that many centuries will pass before 
<br>
things get to the point where Kurzweil desires. E. Yudkowsky, holds that, if 
<br>
I read his essays correctly, highly advanced A.I. will develop the science 
<br>
for this, whether the world desires it or not, during the next 99 years-the 
<br>
computers will be inventing the best theories, processes, and how to apply 
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>So it comes down to a satisfaction level. Is the customer satisfied? Is there 
<br>
a living person left behind after uploading (answer no!), do the relatives 
<br>
recognize the &quot;person&quot; in the net, and does that set of programs that 
<br>
comprise that &quot;person&quot; recognize itself, through many different computer 
<br>
generated environments???
