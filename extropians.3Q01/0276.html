<p>Thanks for the welcome, Spike! I believe your
<br>
professor. The music students were there, too, I bet,
<br>
trying to drown it all out with Beethoven's 9th
<br>
Symphony, last movement.
<br>
<p>I was not in favor of the war the rioters purported to
<br>
protest, but I doubt some of them protested it for any
<br>
other reason than to get attention. I believe the
<br>
people who did the best jobs at protesting ACTED
<br>
peacefully and set an example. The rioters, by using
<br>
Vietnam as an excuse, broke things and hurled missiles
<br>
in compliance only with the ordinances of violent
<br>
hypocracy. Yet I recall a few of my former
<br>
acquaintances taking credit for implementing the final
<br>
push by citizens that they claim got the war ended.
