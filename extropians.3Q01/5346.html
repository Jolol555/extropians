</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Maybe then you can clarify the exact point in time and space that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;Stock options&quot; and the days that are above the minimum were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fought for and achieved? While you at it, find out where they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;forced to pay for my relocation to a new city for this job.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What about my company bonus? When did the evil business owners
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;collapse to the demands for this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, glad to help....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The shift in the time-space continuum you refereed to occurred in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chicago on May 4th 1886.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without this occurring we probably wouldn't even have minimum wage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I figured you would dodge this. I didn't ask about when minimum wage
<br>
started, I'm asking why everyone isn't getting paid minimum wage?!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Like I said, this &quot;modern labor shortage&quot; could have been reached
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;MUCH earlier if the market for labor wasn't distorted by labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;unions trying to artificially raise their pay rates above market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;value.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you said. now try applying modern economic theory and give us a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proof.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What proof? If a company pays you 50K instead of 25K, they cant hire that
<br>
2nd person. Cant imagine anyone not getting that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;Only by controlling the supply of labor by force. What if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;factory was forced to pay people 3 dollars and hour, and they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;forced to do so by the union. Then here I come in. I need a job so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I tell the company Ill do the work for 2.50 and hour. The supply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;just lowered the value of the labor, but wait, they cant hire me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;at that rate, the union wont let them. Too bad too, the company
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;had enough money budgeted in to accept me at that rate, but cant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;afford me at $3. Guess Ill just have to go tell the kids no food
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;this month. If you drought this happens, look at the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working &gt;in the automotive companies making 50K a year for bolting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on &gt;wheels. Now THATS insanity. The work isn't worth whats being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Funny how you don't blame the company for not hiring you at $3.00
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an hour when they accepted your offer at $2.50.
</em><br>
<p>You missed my point again. They don't have the funds to hire you for 3, only
<br>
2.50. If this logic worked, we could just raise the minimum wage to a
<br>
million dollars an hour and well all be rich right? Just pay them all more
<br>
is the mantra here right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You claim tire installers are making 50K? how about some proof, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the way if it wasn't worth it the company wouldn't pay it....
</em><br>
<p>I personally have 1 uncle that works at Ford on the assembly line. He makes
<br>
45K for reasonable unskilled work due to union pressure. The companies may
<br>
be making a profit, but I wonder how much more they could have grown
<br>
otherwise. How many more jobs would have been created. How many more people
<br>
hired? Maybe they might be buying Fords in Japan if that had been the case?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;So lets just get them to throw a monkey wrench into the company
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;machinery, that ought to help create wealth a lot. Maybe their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;related to those Luddites?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They're on the picket line, nowhere near the machinery...
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, like I said, the teamsters were simply angels.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Technical shortcomings of capitalism? Like what? The fact everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;wasn't millionares overnight? I hope you didnt expect capitalism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to magicially make everyone wealthy instantly, it takes time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;build trade up to the levels they are now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like given that without government intervention companies can form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monopoly/monopsonies and completely distort the prices in a market.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This has happened previously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lets try a modern day example. Suppose Microsoft was the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software company in the world. Do you think anyone would be getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stock options and bonuses or relocation allowances, or would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmers be working for minimum wage.
</em><br>
<p>Microsoft is NOT a coercive monopoly. Only the government can create an
<br>
organization and use the power of force to keep it on top (like post office,
<br>
utilities, etc..). Microsoft is on top because they provide a product that
<br>
people WANT to buy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Let me summerize this in 2 points.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;1. Labor unions OR buisnesses dont controll the price of labor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Either a monopoly or a monopsony can control the price of either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goods or labor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No such thing as a private industry monopoly in the US. Doesn't exist.
<br>
There's companies that hold a lot of market share, but they can be pulled
<br>
down by market forces and they cant use FORCE to prevent it. You want to
<br>
bring down Microsoft, make a better operating system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;2. Distortions in the market create inefficiencies and ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;slow down wealth creation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed, and either a monopsony or monopoly can create such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distortions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brian
</em><br>
<p>But those poor ragged starving masses cant distort the market it seems, even
<br>
with the power of a union. Its so easy to empathize with those sweet
<br>
innocent non-violent unions when the antagonist is some burly evil
<br>
corporation that kills, maims, and steal little children's candy for the fun
<br>
of it.
