<p><em>&gt; Second, there are 4 main reasons for which the US are aimed : support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Israel, presence in Saudi (sacred home land of islam), general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world domination, and cultural influence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I see no really good reason for a continuing large force in
<br>
Saudi Arabia.  It doesn't provide significant enough detterrent
<br>
relative to our ability to quickly move in forces when necessary
<br>
for the level of action present imho.  And it costs an arm and a
<br>
leg financially as well as in good will of the people in the
<br>
region.  
<br>
<p>I don't see why it is the business of the US to practice world
<br>
domination nor do I see us really doing that.  If it is our
<br>
business then we should do it honestly imho and establish a true
<br>
one-world government and mono-culture.  If it isn't our business
<br>
then we should spend a lot less time and energy butting into the
<br>
business of others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Basically, you can't help on any of these points. In particular, world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domination will be more and more necessary, as more destructive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons get available (for the long term, see Drexler for example) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will imply things like presence in Saudi and support for Israel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cultural influence seems inevitable, too, disrupting their society,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and giving women for example &quot;absurd and dangerous&quot; ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>You can help on these points by having a clearer foreign policy
<br>
and notion of what our goals and interests are and are not and
<br>
what means are and are not acceptable for attaining those ends.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Such hatred is not compatible with much of most religious belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; systems or their literature.  It is practiced by some subset of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; religious groups.  It is quite questionable even within their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; religion.  Such questioning by other members of their religion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of differening opinions is probably one of the fastest peaceful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ways to diffuse such &quot;religious&quot; hatred.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That may well be, but I'm not sure how we make this happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ANd you should not dismiss too easily that there is something in islam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that makes it produce with regularity this tiny minority of terrorists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't dismiss it easily but I don't believe the fault is in
<br>
Islam
<br>
itself.  If you want terrorists and mad crusades look at
<br>
Christianity
<br>
about 500 years ago and some of the continuing extremism to this
<br>
day. Yet there is no real support for such methods in the New
<br>
Testament.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; For example, in Christianism, force is not well regarded. It is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; islam. In Christianism, you should love even your ennemy. Not in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; islam.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not quite true.  Even your enemy should be treated with honor
<br>
and using respectable means.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The word &quot;valid&quot; is the problem. Their claims (like having Jews out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Palestine, and having US out of Saoudi, and finally extending islam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; over the planet) are valid according to them, but not according to you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; (well, to me at least). As this translates in attacks on you, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; cannot afford so much tolerance as to treat them as &quot;valid&quot;, even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; they are valid in some sense (= they are consistant with their sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of justice).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Even without these very questionable things there are many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; claims that are perfectly valid where we did in fact act in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; slimey and underhanded fashion.  We can at least address those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; honestly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You sure can and should. But be prepared that it won't solve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if these very points were done for opportunistic reasons, as a way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of protecting your control and domination, then &quot;correcting&quot; them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might make things even worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think we have any business doing control and domination
<br>
games that haven't been broadly approved and aren't honestly
<br>
pursued.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course this is a bit of a constraint. But I think it is quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; understandable. The US have been hurt, they seek back up. It doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; seem very responsible from us (France) to decline it -- and then ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; more support from you when things go worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sure but this is not the point. France should not support US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; policies and actions on this blindly any more than Americans should.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Freedom includes the right to freely question and to disagree. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doesn't make you or your country complicit in terrorism if you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; disagree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this is not a yes/no problem. Imagine that your friend is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; badly hurt, and asks help from you to counter. Depending on the kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of help she asks, what really happened, what might happen next, who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the attacker, etc., you will have a tension between various desires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and fears. It's a matter of nuance and quantity, and to make the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice you need to limitate the amount of blindness and cowardness that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you put in the resolution of the problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Where did cowardice entere into this?  How does any blindness at
<br>
all help?  We have been blind and in reaction mode and tweak a
<br>
dangerously unstable pile of potentialities for reliatively
<br>
unstated goals for a long time.  It is part of what got us into
<br>
this mess.  I don't see where more of the same or more of a show
<br>
of faith toward whatever is proposed now by the US is actually
<br>
helpful.
