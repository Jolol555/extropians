</em><br>
<p>Which is why I think your idea might be a good thing, *if* done as an
<br>
actual space colony rather than another micronation on the Earth.  We
<br>
can say anything we want; the proof is in what we do - thus, we will be
<br>
believed a lot more if we are quite visibly doing space research by
<br>
dint of living up there.  Plus, once up there, we gain easier access
<br>
to asteroids et al, which helps solve the resource problem.  (If there
<br>
were an equally rich source at some spot under the sea, then one might
<br>
likewise suggest founding a colony near said spot, either underwater or
<br>
on the surface with a column for easy mineral and mining robot
<br>
transport down to it.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I must bring the important issues into our awareness now instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding ourselves confronted with this unpleasant issue in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future.  In space living, we absolutely require high power weapons to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deflect or destroy asteroids or we have to have very good rockets or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-Newtonian populsion (to avoid problems with acceleration on human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bodies).
</em><br>
<p>Ah...that's not too much more of a problem for a colony in Earth orbit
<br>
than for the Earth itself.  That is to say, for the most part, it's no
<br>
problem at all.  Micrometeorites and solar radiation are more of a
<br>
problem, but neither of those can justify high powered weapons.  OTOH,
<br>
mounting (low-power) rockets on the colony will do wonders to confound
<br>
anyone lobbing weapons at us, since with most such weapons, we'll have
<br>
easily an hour's (probably a day's) warning if we have some automated
<br>
telescopes scanning for objects incoming from Earth...and (at least at
<br>
first) they will probably be ballistic once launched, meaning they
<br>
can't react to our dodging.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These weapons can also act as a good deterrent to any nasty nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that irrationally want to destory us.  The luddites may think that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to take over the world but:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) we can go far away and say we don't want to interact with Earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except for the purposes of trade
</em><br>
<p>Except that anyone outside the gravity well can drop stuff into the
<br>
gravity well, with significant destructive potential and little ability
<br>
for the targets to guard (or dodge).  Orbital bombardment is not a new
<br>
concept, even if it hasn't (yet) been put into practice much (though
<br>
see the accidental results of Skylab's reentry).  Therefore, merely
<br>
being up there, by itself, gives us half of a major weapon; the other
<br>
half (gathering the mass, building the launchers, and programming our
<br>
computers with targetting software) can easily be hidden behind
<br>
legitimate colony construction where it's even visible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) we let someone else build their colony first, and wait for them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arm themselves when they find too many asteroids.  Then we can excuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves (provided we can find enough suitable fission material) on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the basis of space defence.
</em><br>
<p>Won't work: no one else has an excuse to arm themselves either, except
<br>
as overt anti-Earth weaponry.  OTOH, if anyone else has significant
<br>
space transport capability, we could certainly justify small arms (say,
<br>
enough to shoot up a space shuttle transporting a large hostile
<br>
boarding party).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suggest purchasing an island or chain of islands at low cost.  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance, some uninhabited islands which have to routinely have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal with tsunamis.  Then we place &quot;wave breakers&quot; under the waters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around the islands.  I don't know if these exists or not, however, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think we can find it technically possible to redirect and reduce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flow of water before it hits land.  Someone once suggested using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bubbles to do the job.  As for tropical storms, we can probably use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some well-placed powerful bombs to disrupt the air flow and stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<p>Ah...that'd take more resources (mainly money) than, I suspect,
<br>
everyone on this list pooled together has, or will probably have for
<br>
the next 10 years (assuming no Singularity before 2015).
