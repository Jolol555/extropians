Where you have an imbalance in power, you need to expect the laws 
<br>
to be designed and applied in a manner designed to strengthen the 
<br>
imbalance.    There are various reasons for this, ranging from the 
<br>
simple fact that people with more power tend to be approved of by 
<br>
others with power, to the more complex people with power tend to 
<br>
have access to sufficient money to run PR campaigns.  It goes 
<br>
further, but we don't need to follow it.  This by itself is 
<br>
sufficient.
<br>
<p>Now it is a given (current condition) that government officials, 
<br>
when acting as government officials, are powerful relative to other 
<br>
individuals.  So when laws are constructed, they will tend to favor 
<br>
government officials over (average) private citizens.  There are 
<br>
all sorts of special cases, but that's the way to expect things to 
<br>
bend. 
<br>
<p>So it's unreasonable to expect the government to implement a 
<br>
transparent society which is transparent in both directions.  Not 
<br>
undesireable, just unreasonable.  If you want that to happen it has 
<br>
to come from somewhere else.  And even then expect the powerful to 
<br>
attempt to twist it to their advantage.  (Of course, you should 
<br>
also expect the less powerful to attempt to twist it to their 
<br>
advantage, but they are starting off three goals behind.)
<br>
<p>If you doubt this, consider the evolution of copyright, patent, and 
<br>
trademark law over the last couple of centuries.
