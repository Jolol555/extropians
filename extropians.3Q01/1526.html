<p>No. This is completely wrong. :-(  [sigh]
<br>
<p>This is why I keep repeating over and over that I am not against 
<br>
capitalism; to avoid exactly this kind of misreading of my intentions.
<br>
<p>I used the description of capitalism as religion to describe the way some 
<br>
people use the concept as a faith that doesn't allow contrary points to be 
<br>
heard. When used that way capitalism becomes as dangerous as any religion, 
<br>
because it blinds you to any errors in your assumptions. (I kept repeating 
<br>
this too.)
<br>
<p>I hoped such a reference would be useful in defusing that religious 
<br>
standpoint. I figured, wrongly it turns out, that because the people on 
<br>
this list are generally opposed to religious acceptance of dogma that it 
<br>
might give them pause. Unfortunately it often produced a kneejerk response 
<br>
of &quot;to arms! she is attacking our dogma!&quot;  :-(
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Now, I've actually presented arguments and evidence of why a free market 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;works in various cases Mariam English and others have given us as examples 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of free market failure.  Instead of actually answering me on this, Mariam 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has just piled up more examples.  In other words, she can't reply to my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;specific arguments, so she moves on to other ones.
</em><br>
<p>The reason I kept showing problems that can arise from capitalism is *not* 
<br>
because I hate it or want to destroy it. It is because all I needed to show 
<br>
was that problems can arise -- it is not The Answer. In telling me that it 
<br>
mostly does work you are preaching to the converted. I already know that it 
<br>
mostly works. Your BIG mistake was in continually thinking that I was 
<br>
opposed to capitalism. I am not. How many ways can I say this??
<br>
<p>The reason I stopped replying in detail to many responses is:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- they completely missed my point: that I am not against capitalism or 
<br>
trying to smear free market ideas, but am worried by fanatical adoption of 
<br>
those as articles of faith
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- I want to get back to my VR project -- I don't have limitless time to 
<br>
devote to ineffective debate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- it is not really a major point worth pursuing over days and days of 
<br>
email -- how hard can it be to understand that elevating capitalism to 
<br>
religion status  is dangerous?
<br>
<p>I did respond where:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- I felt people were honestly trying to make logical arguments
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- the misrepresentation of what I said made me take the bait  :-(
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;To me this sounds a lot like when I debate with Creationists.  They will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tell me evolution is disproven by some case A.  When I show them that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are wrong about A, they ignore this and bring up case B.  When I show them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that they are wrong about B, they ignore this and bring up case C.  And so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on.  I think you get where I'm going.
</em><br>
<p>This is just plain wrong, and a little insulting.
<br>
<p>I'm not trying to convert you.
<br>
<p>I have tried to sound a note of caution -- that free market capitalism, 
<br>
efficient though it is, and probably the best economic model to date, is a 
<br>
flawed model. Being blinded to those flaws by faith is just asking for trouble.
<br>
<p>You are defending something which is only under attack if it dogma.
<br>
If it is a reasoned point of view then there is nothing to defend from what 
<br>
I have said.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
