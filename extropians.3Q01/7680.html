using any advanced cryptographic techniques.

<p><p><p>You really think this is uncrackable, don't you?
<br>
<p>Are you so confident that you would bet me a million dollars on it?
<br>
<p>Think hard about this before scrolling down!!!
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>OK...  I am NOT betting a million dollars!  (I don't think either of us
<br>
could afford it!)  I just wanted to see if you really thought this was an
<br>
uncrackable code and not just a flippant example thrown out without much
<br>
thought.
<br>
<p>This code may not be as perfect as you think.
<br>
<p>I assume that this is just a simple word replacement code.  You took a
<br>
common book or document, and replaced each word of your message with its
<br>
position number from the document.  Your first word is word #17 in the
<br>
document.  Your second word is #5 in the document.  And so forth.  If so,
<br>
this is a classical code that was used in the Cold War.  Such codes were
<br>
frequently cracked by both sides.  This is why they were discarded in favor
<br>
of modern encryption.
<br>
<p>Such codes are vulnerable to statistical analysis.  If your messages are in
<br>
English, your most common word will be &quot;the&quot;, the second most common word
<br>
will be &quot;and&quot;, the third &quot;to&quot;, the fourth &quot;of&quot;, and so forth.  Other
<br>
languages would have other statistical numbers for each of their words.
<br>
Just applying these statistical probabilities to your messages will decode
<br>
most of the words.  The rare ones that don't decode could be determined by
<br>
context, especially in the case of multiple instances.  (Names and locations
<br>
may not decode since they are arbitrary labels and not part of the language
<br>
vocabulary.)
<br>
<p>If this direct approach didn't work, there is still the brute-force method.
<br>
Instead of searching for passwords in order or decryption keys in order,
<br>
this brute-force search would go through a list of book and document titles
<br>
sorted in order of popularity.  A fast server connected to an online library
<br>
on the Internet could grab the first 54 words of each document and try it as
<br>
the solution.  If it could do this at a rate of one per second, it could try
<br>
86,400 documents in the first day, 604,800 in the first week, 2,628,000 in
<br>
the first month, and 31,536,000 in the first year.  Using multiple computers
<br>
to split up the work could dramatically increase these numbers.
<br>
<p>So be honest...  Was your message in English or some other natural language
<br>
that could be decoded by the statistical frequency of each word?  If not,
<br>
was your code book a common book likely to be found on the Internet such
<br>
that a brute-force search would find it?  Or, more specifically, if you had
<br>
bet me a million dollars could I have been planning my retirement?
