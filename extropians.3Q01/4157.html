<p>That has not been my experience.  In theory, judging by written,
<br>
formal policy, most religions arae this way.  In practice, whenever
<br>
people cite any religious reason for anything, it has usually boiled
<br>
down to &quot;I believe reality should be this way, facts be damned&quot;.  Only
<br>
demonstrations that reality is not that way - for instance, the old
<br>
experiment with three jars of meat left outside (one sealed, one
<br>
covered by cloth, one open) to demonstrate that decaying meat does not
<br>
itself produce maggots - have proven sufficient to dislodge said
<br>
thinking, and then only among those who do not insist that such
<br>
disproofs must be some kind of unspecified trickery (whether or not
<br>
they can figure out how such trickery could be accomplished) since it
<br>
goes against their beliefs.
<br>
<p>Therefore, in practice (at least such as I have personally observed),
<br>
religions can be safely categorized with, and dismissed along with,
<br>
thinking along the lines of that which, for example, claims the moon
<br>
landing was a hoax, or that the earth is flat, or that all living
<br>
organisms must eventually die (see certain bacteria that have lived
<br>
millions of years, or certain lines of human cancer cells that so far
<br>
appear to show no signs of aging over multiple decades).
