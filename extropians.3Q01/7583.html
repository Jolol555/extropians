[I'm dipping into the Extropians list only rarely, so any direct replies 
<br>
please cc to me at &lt;<a href="mailto:max@maxmore.com?Subject=Re:%20CANCER:%20%20Okay,%20so%20I%20got%20it%20and%20then%20smiled.&In-Reply-To=&lt;5.1.0.14.2.20010926131055.03969e60@mail.speakeasy.org&gt;">max@maxmore.com</a>&gt; ]
<br>
<p>I just saw Natasha's note. It was a relief to find out a few days ago that 
<br>
she was (so-far) cancer-free. However, the price of cancer-freedom is 
<br>
eternal vigilance. This kind of cancer does have a high return rate.
<br>
<p>As Natasha mentioned, she found frighteningly large blood clots immediately 
<br>
before going in to start her Extro-5 presentation. (If anyone wondered what 
<br>
I was doing in the Ladies room, now you know.) I was amazed at her 
<br>
fortitude in going ahead and doing the presentation in such a way that no 
<br>
one would know that anything was awry.
<br>
<p>Natasha has continued to show great courage and resiliency in the face of a 
<br>
disease that I know she had long feared getting, due to previous work with 
<br>
carcinogenic chemicals. Although her Kronos Clinic tests show no toxic 
<br>
metals now in her system, the damage was done long before. I will be at her 
<br>
side, monitoring this and fighting off any recurrence until, we hope, 
<br>
cancer will soon become a minor, easily-treatable health problem.
<br>
<p>My admiration for and love of Natasha has only increased during this time. 
<br>
I'm proud to be married to her.
<br>
<p>Let me take this opportunity to urge all of you, especially those who 
<br>
aren't as young as they once were, to get a check-up, if you haven't had 
<br>
one recently. The Kronos Clinic program is excellent (and will probably 
<br>
find heart disease risk factors) but does not yet screen for cancer.
<br>
<p>Best wishes to all, and much love to a remarkable woman.
<br>
<p>Max
