<em>&gt;     &gt;At a range of 10,000 miles, you need an accuracy  measured in tiny

<em>&gt;     &gt;infinitesimal fractions of seconds of arc,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tiny yes infinitesimal no.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; while the  accuracy you need to hit the moon is in many whole minutes of arc
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;accuracy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we know were the moon is to an inch and a half we'll know where your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deathstar battle wagon is even better. And it's not like I'd only have one shot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at hitting you. A medium sized rocket could easily carry thousands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projectiles each with enough energy to knock out a 65 ton M1 tank. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if you're incredibly lucky and none of them hit you just wait 45
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minutes and you run into the same stuff again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;and the moon can't maneuver, either... the SBL can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If this huge satellite is constantly changing its orbit where is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it getting the fuel to do so? Do you have two shuttle flights a day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-supplying it? Or can it detect a grain of sand moving toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it at 11 miles a second from such a long distance that it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time to jump out of the way?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt; and its easy to make in course corrections with primitive sigting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt; systems when steering for the moon, not so to hit a small SBL target
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; you need accurate data piped up from ground stations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We've had that for more than 40 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; Essentially, in order to have a system that eliminates the SBL system,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; you basically need your own SDI capability as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What you'd need is a bucket of sand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; Then why are they all so oriented?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; Apparently you are not aware of orbital mechanics. Trajectory is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;dependent upon the mass ratio between the two bodies orbiting each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apparently you are not aware of high school physics. The difference in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass between the Earth and the warhead is so huge that you only need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to consider the gravitational effect of the earth on the warhead and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can ignore the gravitational effect of the warhead on the Earth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True, an anvil and a feather moving at the same velocity In a vacuum  would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have different orbits, but you'd need an scanning tunneling microscope to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detect the difference.
</em><br>
<p>No, not really. I suggest you actually calculate it. It's highly
<br>
dependent on altitude.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; the explosive shock of the balloon material erupting like that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; would likely cause damage to the IRV unless it is further reinforced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of all the silly things said in this thread this must be number one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A  warhead tough enough to withstand 500 g's and intense heat as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reenters the atmosphere at high angle is going to be damaged by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; popping of a toy Mylar balloon that weighs about an once! I love it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; John, don't you remember what you posted last? You said to throw some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; nuts in the reverse direction of the SBL. That implies a retrograde  orbit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; POLAR ORBIT! East is opposite to west, North is opposite  to South, is this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really that hard to understand.
</em><br>
<p>Where are the launchers and where are the targets, John? With China or
<br>
NK as the launcher and the US as the target, the missiles will go west
<br>
to east. The SBLs follow 40 degree inclined orbits, i.e. mostly west to
<br>
east. Any interceptors will need to either come from in front or behind.
<br>
Crossing shots are much more difficult (being a sporting clays shooter,
<br>
I can attest to this), so a 'north/south' orbit would be even more
<br>
difficult to hit the SBL than from an equatorial orbit....
