<em>&gt; Olga said:

<em>&gt; Except to say, that if any of you so-called classical liberals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (sometimes this translates to libertarian - is this correct?) can give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me your scenario of how you would have solved the segregation problem in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the South during the 1950s and 1960s (or earlier, dare one hope?), I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eat my ACLU membership card.
</em><br>
<p>One of the most famous segregation problems was telling Blacks to move to
<br>
the back of the bus.  IIRC, that was a municipal bus company, or one granted
<br>
a monopoly by the state.  They could get away with dissin' some segment of
<br>
their customers because they had no competition.  Libertarians don't favor
<br>
outlawing stupidity, but stupidity should have its costs.  IMHO, a free
<br>
market in transportation with no legal barriers to entry wouldn't insulate
<br>
stupidity from these type costs as much.
