</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Kuhn's theory was that all scientific theories are equally and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; subjectively valid, and one only gains credence over another due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; class conflict between established scientists and the younger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; generations of scientists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Is that in &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;?  That's sure not what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I learned from that book!  Where is this part of his mindset exposed?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think Mike is more or less right on this occasion (I mean
<br>
&quot;correct&quot;; he's always
<br>
(somewhere to the) right &lt;g&gt;). Kuhn does talk somewhere about old scientists
<br>
having to die off (though not by violence) as part of the way new paradigms
<br>
achieve acceptance.
<br>
<p>Russell who most definitely has read Kuhn
