While I appreciate the sentiments of the letter.  It isn't referenced,
<br>
so one has to ask:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Iran has no less than 38 intermediate range nuclear missiles ready
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to go.
</em><br>
<p>Evidence?
<br>
<p>Re: smallpox
<br>
<em>&gt; You are talking about one infected person could cause a wildfire affect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; across a nation and the globe. This viscous disease will kill within a week.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The USA for example only has a total of 7 million vaccines available.
</em><br>
<p>Once the outbreak became known we would likely have a tremendous
<br>
hunkering down by people not traveling anywhere near locations
<br>
where there are known outbreaks.  The damage to economies might
<br>
be much worse than the damage from the smallpox itself.
<br>
<p>It is also true that one could probably scale up a crash vaccination
<br>
production program if required.  You could synthesize the required
<br>
DNA vectors around the world and do bulk fermentation growth in
<br>
wine or beer manufacturing equipment.  You might not get the best
<br>
vaccine out of it but something is better than nothing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; SMALLPOX escaped the controlled laboratories with the end of the Russian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communist regime.
</em><br>
<p>Credible evidence?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The required resources, technology, and human endeavor are at our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collective fingertips.
</em><br>
<p>True, neutralizing antibodies produced in bulk would be much more
<br>
effective than vaccines at stopping the spread of viral diseases.
<br>
A very clever technique *has* been published that demonstrates it is
<br>
possible to use a mutated anthrax toxin to neutralize the normal anthrax
<br>
toxin by disrupting the channel in forms.  One would need bulk production
<br>
of this, though one could imagine the conversion of insulin production
<br>
facilities in a crisis situation.
<br>
<p>I don't mind being urged to action, the claims need to be backed by
<br>
credible evidence though.  For example I've seen claims that bin Laden
<br>
obtained soviet nuclear missle warheads from the Chechnyans, but the
<br>
question becomes *where* did the Chechnyans get them.
<br>
