<em>&gt; Originally: RE: TERRORISM: looking for solutions

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The concept of trustability has its roots in Game Theory.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From what I know of Game Theory, I can draw some conclusions:
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 1) Without trust, a society will function only on its lowest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;denominator, if we consider it a society at all. People will only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;look out for their self-interests and would not perceive to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;preemptively strike those they perceive as a threat, to ensure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their own survival.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Yes. This seems to be in line with the work of Francis Fukuyama. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) To create trust without a free information flow, the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;common solution would require establishing a hierarchy. In such an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organization (e.g. Governments), by virtue of the inequality of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power, can track and punish individuals who infringe on trust and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thus maintain a working level of trustfulness (and also a related
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concept called security).
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The drawback is of course that even benign hierarchies have a
<br>
tendency to become seriously self-serving, as described by the
<br>
public choice school in economics. And due to their basis in power
<br>
inequalities rather than respect for rights there are few factors to
<br>
correct for this. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) A society without any structure, if it has to function
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiently, would have to self-create a Government. thus,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anarchismw would not work because it would sow its seeds for its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own destruction. Humans have an instinct to form groups (of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose's members they can trust much more than others) thanks to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution selecting out anti-social humans.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
To my knowledge, anarchists are seldom atomists. All serious
<br>
anarchist social ideas (be they anarchocapitalist or left
<br>
anarchists) include various forms of *voluntary* social
<br>
organisations (companies, communes) that would help society
<br>
function. Anarchocapitalists expect trust through contract
<br>
and legal systems, leftist anarchists expect trust to develop due to
<br>
self interest and individual social maturation. 
<br>
<p>Note that you have so far ignored the spread of information and the
<br>
effect of including individual rights into this framework. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Notes: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem forbids any system that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims to cater for all people in all situations.
</em><br>
<p>How do you come to this conclusion? It just claims that a formal
<br>
system powerful enough to handle arithmethic is either inconsistent
<br>
or incomplete. Human societies are not formal systems in the first
<br>
place (despite the efforts of constitutional lawyers), and obviously
<br>
inconsistent and random to some extent. 
<br>
<p>You might be thinking of the Arrow theorem?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Surely, the claims
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by capitalist-anarchists do not work because of such. While the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Theory of Evolution may *appear* to apply to human society, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fails
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(as the Theorm predicts) to apply to human societies because humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can and will think out of the system. Placed in simple terms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can and do exploit the social systems they encounter. This ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt;confers the ability to lie, to see through paradoxes and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;make-believe&quot;, and confers the greatest difference between a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and a Turing machine. Evolution Theory applies well only to beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simple enough to remain within the system rules.
</em><br>
<p>Why wouldn't a Turing machine be able to lie, make use of the system
<br>
to suit its purposes and handle paradoxes? My artificial life
<br>
simulations and neural networks do that every day (in a limited
<br>
form), while running on a finite Turing machine. Look out for the
<br>
Penrosian &quot;we are better than machines&quot; meme!
<br>
<p>You are also wrong in claiming it is the theory of evolution is
<br>
inapplicable because humans are so clever and unpredictable agents.
<br>
While there are valid arguments against memetics as a good model of
<br>
human behavior (such as Torsten Nahm's speech at TransVision 01),
<br>
human behavior does appear to fit a Popperian evolutionary
<br>
epistemology, where we learn and act in a feedback loop. It is very
<br>
adaptive, leads to evolutionary change but can be remarkably
<br>
Lamarkian if needed. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4) The fastest way to create trust would require the removal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ability to make deceit in all of us, or our disire to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While we know this has high impossibility, we can approximate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something like that by:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a. Having a free flow of *all* information, including what we
</em><br>
consider as private
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b. Having a group of people capable of handling such free flow of
</em><br>
information (such as those not prone to gossip)
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; c. the exclusion of people who refuse, or has insufficient ability
</em><br>
to participate in such open-ness
<br>
<p>I.e. what you suggest is a voluntary transparent society? Halperin's
<br>
_The Truth Machine_ might also be approaching, given the advances in
<br>
brain fingerprinting.
<br>
<p>However, this might not be the fastest way of creating trust, since
<br>
it would require a serious re-training of many cultural aspects of
<br>
the participants, and if it is to be relevant has to encompass a
<br>
sizeable number of people. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Project Sociologistics aims to create a social system (in theory)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that supports such a fundamental &quot;right&quot;, as long as such pursuit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-actualisation aims to understand the universe and conducted in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an ethical manner.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
You run into the usual problem of positive rights here, of course.
<br>
Should society support me if I claim my personal growth hinges on
<br>
counting grains of sand? It might even be true, but it is clearly
<br>
unproductive for everybody else. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) Freedom from Mundane Issues
</em><br>
<p>Note that the problems you name in this section are those which are
<br>
commonly dealt with in liberal studies through the open society. By
<br>
having a society with strong member feedback, enforced 
<br>
accountability and the freedom to adapt to meet new challenges, most
<br>
of these problems can be ameliorated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4) Freedom to Trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What good would we, to live in a society of whom members we cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trust. This freedom provides for high levels of trust among a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society's own members, such as by disclosure of all data each one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has on everything. It facilitates, via unity, the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;execute
</em><br>
<em>&gt;projects that require many people. If everyone will trust each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like a mother with a child, our societies will have much lesser
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problems.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
But is this also a freedom not to trust? If I know enough about a
<br>
certain person, I might decide not to deal with him since I consider
<br>
him untrustworthy or his interests counter to mine. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5) Freedom of Non-Interference
</em><br>
... 
<br>
<em>&gt; This applies to the society both ways, in that it will not
</em><br>
interfere in other's affairs if they don't interfere with it, and
<br>
the hope that others will also comply with this rule. This also
<br>
applies on the microscopic manner, where one seeks not to interfere
<br>
with each other's activity unless one has his or her interests
<br>
threatened.
<br>
<p>I.e. the standard liberal dictum of &quot;my rights end where yours
<br>
start&quot;. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Clearly, creating an independent rational society by taking over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another nation would just spur military action, but also face
</em><br>
<em>&gt;uncooperation among the irrational people who would break the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of trust. Hence, I recommended, and continue to recommend, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;setting up of a colony in unclaimed or purchased land or space.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Making a colony work gets difficult enough, but having to fend off
</em><br>
<em>&gt;military attacks while doing so, will make it almost impossible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work. Converting an irrational to an rational one would sounds so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impossible that I think this problem does not have enough worth to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;justify assigning our computing resources to solve it.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
As I have previously pointed out, this kind of emigration strategy
<br>
is unlikely to be as efficient as actually changing existing
<br>
societies. You don't need to make everybody and the entire society
<br>
rational in order to reap substantial benefits.
<br>
<p>It might be worth pondering why democracy has spread worldwide. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; hence, I hope with this posting, to provide some hints on how
</em><br>
we can construct a society based on trust. I hope it helps. Please
<br>
read the paper, or part of it, before formulating the reply, as you
<br>
could contribute redundant points that I would find reluctant to
<br>
reply due to insufficient time.
<br>
<p>A bit too late for that now, isn't it?
