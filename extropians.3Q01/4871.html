John Clark writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The physicist Richard Feynman was one of the greatest geniuses of the 20'th
</em><br>
<em>&gt; century and when he was in high school he had an IQ test. He got a mediocre 125.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure that this was an improperly administered, or a very badly
<br>
designed test.  I've studied excerpts from Feynman's high school
<br>
math notebooks.  I was astonished at how much they resembled *my*
<br>
own high school informal math notebooks.  Even the writing looked
<br>
the same.  There was almost exactly the same level of (if I may say
<br>
so) clever mathematical thinking in one so young.  You could really
<br>
see the intelligence shining through.
<br>
<p>One difference, however, was that these extremely similar displays
<br>
were done by Feynman at fifteen and me at sixteen and a half.  If
<br>
you do the division implied by &quot;intelligence quotient&quot; you come
<br>
up with an I.Q. difference between Feynman and me that was proably
<br>
real.  You simply can't tell me that he wouldn't have knocked the
<br>
top off of any reasonable I.Q. test.
