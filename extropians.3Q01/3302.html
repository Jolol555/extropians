</em><br>
<em>&gt; that if two children have access to a piece of candy, only one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them can eat it.  They may be friends, but each will value most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly the outcome that benefits them.  There is no logical way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around this.   Now how severe the conflict is will depend on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several things, for example, how hungry each is.  But that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valuations will be different is inescapable.  They aren't using the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same sensory organs.  The candy that I taste isn't tasted by you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This is scarcity thinking.  It is part of what we must move
<br>
beyond if we are going to have a future we want to arrive at. 
<br>
In a world of MNT there is not much reason for physical
<br>
scarcity.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not even bringing in the social conflicts:  &quot;I'm not hungry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now, but if I don't eat it, then she will eat it, and I won't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to eat it later, when I would want to, so I'll eat it now.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Were you to ask me if that was rational, I'd be forced to say no,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I almost remember thinking that and making that decision.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was accompanied by a feel of defiance... that isn't the decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that my mother would want me to make.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Your mother is of course irrelevant.  If I don't need it now and
<br>
she does then why shouldn't I enjoy her happiness?  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; And this was with me sister.  This was with the person I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occasionally risked physical injury to defend.  Not some stranger,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with whom I wouldn't have the shared &quot;family&quot;ness.  I was less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to share with strangers.  (I find myself quite convinced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dawkins &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; ... the predictions that it makes seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to match those that I have been able to observe around me.  And the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments aren't unreasonable... they merely require a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point of view than was standard in school.)
</em><br>
<p>This may match our default programming but we are not limited to
<br>
our default programming unless we choose to be.
<br>
<p>How will you hack yourself today?
