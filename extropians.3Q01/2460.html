I wrote, in reply to Olga
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; No one denies that racism exists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; [Sorry -- I shouldn't exaggerate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Someone somewhere probably does.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; But some people call racist the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; belief that not all groups are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; exactly equal to all other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; groups in every way  ...
</em><br>
<p>and she replied
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also call racist the tendency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of white people not to want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take any responsibility for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; egregious crimes against blacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the USA.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I totally disagree with your
<br>
partial definition.  I've never
<br>
committed any crime against black
<br>
people, and absolutely refuse to
<br>
take any responsibility for such.
<br>
You can't force me to take resp-
<br>
onsibility for acts committed by
<br>
other people who look like me.
<br>
That's really &quot;guilt by association&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If blacks had had the same opportunities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as whites, without those generations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upon generations of families which were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; torn from each other at will (shifted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about and sold to the highest bidder),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used as sex slaves, denied education,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-determination, dignity and person-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hood - only to be shunned and excluded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after the end of slavery for several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more generations ... if you don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that that may just be one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributing reasons why &quot;not all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups are exactly equal to all other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups in every way ...&quot;
</em><br>
<p>But I do believe that it was a
<br>
contributing factor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you're right [presumably about all groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being unequal].  But who's responsible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this state of affairs?
</em><br>
<p>Not me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And think about this:  if whites had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone through what blacks had to go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through for those hundreds of years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our &quot;pecking&quot; order may have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in reverse order at this stage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the game.
</em><br>
<p>There is no doubt about it.  Color
<br>
of skin can't be magical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; One thing you never responded to, Lee, and that was my quip about George W.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Bush.  Even though I was being sarcastic, it was still a serious question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I read loud and clear that you are opposed to affirmative action.  But, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; see, we have affirmative action for white people (that's what I meant to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; imply when I said that George W. Bush is an Affirmative Action Baby
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (&quot;AAB&quot;)).  Why aren't you opposed to affirmative action for white people?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Did George W. Bush get into the White House on his own merit?  Or is he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (gasp ... groan ... slap on forehead!) an ... AAB?
</em><br>
<p>Affirmative action, in the case of
<br>
education, means including people
<br>
of one group at the expense of
<br>
people of another group who have
<br>
higher scores, simply because
<br>
people in the first group have
<br>
the wrong skin color, or other
<br>
ethnic/religious identity.
<br>
<p>I am opposed to affirmative action for
<br>
white people.  (E.g., at Berkeley, where
<br>
going just by scores, 60% of the students
<br>
would be Chinese, even though they are
<br>
only 7% of the population.)  I am opposed
<br>
to affirmative action for any group.
<br>
<p>George W. Bush may have been favored
<br>
because of his father's influence, and
<br>
I think that he may have had other
<br>
advantages independent of his ability.
<br>
(Please take that sentence literally---
<br>
every word counts.  Please don't read
<br>
any more into it than is there. Thanks.)
<br>
<p>But since he was not discriminated for
<br>
or against in his admission to college
<br>
because of his group (i.e., race, eth-
<br>
nicity, or religious background) I don't
<br>
see why you would call that affirmative
<br>
action.  Moreover, &quot;AA&quot; is a policy,
<br>
implemented in the U.S. for the first
<br>
time in the 1960's.  I do not think it
<br>
quite correct to say that because Jews
<br>
were discriminated against, in the 1920s
<br>
for college admission, that there was
<br>
a policy of affirmative action in favor
<br>
of whites; it's simply true that Jews
<br>
were discriminated *against*.
<br>
<p>The words &quot;affirmative action&quot; came
<br>
from government bureaucrats who came
<br>
up with a euphemism for &quot;favoring
<br>
people of one particular race at the
<br>
expense of other people&quot;.  It was
<br>
later broadened to mean &quot;favoring
<br>
people of any race besides caucasian&quot;.
<br>
<p>So, no, George W. Bush is not an AAB,
<br>
despite his many &quot;unfair&quot; advantages.
<br>
<p>Thank you for actually quoting the
<br>
question that I had omitted to answer.
<br>
<p>Lee
