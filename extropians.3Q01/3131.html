<em>&gt; &gt; Discussions are moved forward, not by the ten thousand critics who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wrong and clueless, but by the hundred critics who are wrong and smart,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and above all by the one critic who is smart and right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me guess who you think that one critic might be.
</em><br>
<p>Mitchell Porter has managed to outguess me twice on major issues, an
<br>
assorted small group of people have managed it once, and now that I'm in
<br>
physical proximity to other Extropians I actually find people outguessing
<br>
me now and then on routine matters, which is an unusual and pleasant
<br>
experience compared to the previous years of my life.
<br>
<p>There are a number of smart people on the list who disagree with various
<br>
aspects of the normal Extropian worldview.  In fact, I can't think of any
<br>
smart person who agrees completely, except Max More, who gets away with it
<br>
only because he technically defines the standard.
<br>
<p>The list environment has been degenerating because of the large number of
<br>
clueless questions drowning out the smart discussion of deep issues.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Seeking out that one critic requires that you be willing to tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the ten thousand others to go do their repetitive babbling on some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other mailing list that's actually interested.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As if that is going to achieve the desired goal.
</em><br>
<p>When I say &quot;tell to go elsewhere&quot;, I of course mean &quot;politely ask to stop
<br>
posting, followed by forcible removal from the list&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The ten thousand useless critics, having vastly overestimated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their own intelligence, will insist that you are being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; close-minded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it would be so good if we had an objective way to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overestimating our own capabilities.
</em><br>
<p>You just have to be more objective than they are.  Note that I don't say
<br>
you have to prove to them that you are objective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Anyone want to revive the Committee on Un-Extropian Activities?  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this list could really use it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would you please clarify?  I don't know if you are being sarcastic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not.  The persecutorial nature of the old HUAC is well-known, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course; but since lists *really are* censored from time to time, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's conceivable that some body of extropians might take this upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves, you might be serious.  Was there really such a committee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the days before I joined the list, to your knowledge?
</em><br>
<p>No, it's a running gag.
<br>
<p>Well, a bit more than that.  I once pointed out that in a physical
<br>
gathering, there's feedback when a group of people want the speaker to
<br>
shut up; they mumble among themselves, cough, glare, wander away... a
<br>
mailing list lacks that feedback.  There's no intermediate level between
<br>
silence and the socially portentous act of actually posting a reply, which
<br>
on some level we think is equivalent to saying &quot;Shut up!&quot; to a speaker we
<br>
don't like.  So perhaps a small band of Extropians should get together and
<br>
begin pointing out posts that are stupid, daring the social consequences,
<br>
since after all it's just a mailing list, and otherwise the quality will
<br>
keep going down.  This group would be called the &quot;Committee on
<br>
Un-Extropian Activities&quot; by way of self-conscious irony and to remind
<br>
ourselves how dangerous such an endeavor can be... not that we really need
<br>
reminding of the danger per se, since it's blindingly obvious to any
<br>
Extropian; more that we acknowledge the danger and openly declare, as a
<br>
statement criticizable by smart but wrong critics, that we think we really
<br>
are that good.
