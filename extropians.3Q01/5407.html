</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe then you can clarify the exact point in time and space
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;that &quot;Stock options&quot; and the days that are above the minimum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;were fought for and achieved? While you at it, find out where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;they were forced to pay for my relocation to a new city for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;job.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;What about my company bonus? When did the evil business owners
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;collapse to the demands for this?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Sure, glad to help....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The shift in the time-space continuum you refereed to occurred
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in Chicago on May 4th 1886.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Without this occurring we probably wouldn't even have minimum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;wage yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I figured you would dodge this. I didn't ask about when minimum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wage started, I'm asking why everyone isn't getting paid minimum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wage?!
</em><br>
<p>I didn't dodge the question I answered it exactly. You asked for
<br>
the exact point in space and time.
<br>
<p>On May 4th 1886 at Haymarket Square in Chicago was the point in
<br>
space/time when relationships between employers and employees was
<br>
permanently altered.
<br>
<p>The sociological singularity that occured on that day like any good
<br>
singularity began literally with a &quot;BANG&quot;.
<br>
<p>The results have cascaded down through space-time since then and
<br>
have resulted in the benefits you received.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;What proof? If a company pays you 50K instead of 25K, they cant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hire that 2nd person. Cant imagine anyone not getting that.
</em><br>
<p>No the proof that without &quot;Union Interference&quot; we would all have
<br>
been better off.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You missed my point again. They don't have the funds to hire you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for 3, only 2.50. If this logic worked, we could just raise the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minimum wage to a million dollars an hour and well all be rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right? Just pay them all more is the mantra here right?
</em><br>
<p>You missed my point, If you were worth $6.00 dollars, they'd have
<br>
no problem hiring you for $3.00.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I personally have 1 uncle that works at Ford on the assembly line.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He makes 45K for reasonable unskilled work due to union pressure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The companies may be making a profit, but I wonder how much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they could have grown otherwise. How many more jobs would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been created. How many more people hired? Maybe they might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;buying Fords in Japan if that had been the case?
</em><br>
<p>Ford has been moving it's production to Mexico. Much of the high
<br>
cost of assembly line work is due to the sheer drudgery of it.
<br>
<p>Have you checked management compensation at Ford?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Yeah, like I said, the teamsters were simply angels.
</em><br>
<p>I never said that you did.
<br>
<p>Hopefully you will never end up in a situation where you are
<br>
literally fighting to feed your kids, you'd be amazed at what your
<br>
capable of.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Microsoft is NOT a coercive monopoly. Only the government can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;create an organization and use the power of force to keep it on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;top (like post office, utilities, etc..). Microsoft is on top
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because they provide a product that people WANT to buy.
</em><br>
<p>The government and millions of critics disagree.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;But those poor ragged starving masses cant distort the market it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seems, even with the power of a union. Its so easy to empathize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with those sweet innocent non-violent unions when the antagonist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is some burly evil corporation that kills, maims, and steal little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;children's candy for the fun of it.
</em><br>
<p>If you can't abstain from the rhetoric, this is just a waste of
<br>
time.
