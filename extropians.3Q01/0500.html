<p>Arrg. Where to start?
<br>
<p>It's very wierd (to me) that you even brought up this
<br>
(excellent)
<br>
book in this context.
<br>
<p>You're argument has generally been that all religions
<br>
are bad and
<br>
should be wiped out (through force?), and then you
<br>
turn around and
<br>
recommend a book which presents &quot;mystical experiences&quot;
<br>
in a positive
<br>
light, revealing how they have their basis in actual
<br>
occurrences
<br>
in the brain.
<br>
<p>The book in question is in the same general genre as
<br>
Austin's &quot;Zen
<br>
and the Brain&quot;.
<br>
<p>Revealing that mystical experiences occur because this
<br>
or that
<br>
section of the brain temporarily does this or that
<br>
unusual thing
<br>
DOES arguably &quot;debunk&quot; CERTAIN aspects of CERTAIN
<br>
&quot;religious&quot; beliefs,
<br>
but it just as arguably ALSO does REINFORCE OTHER
<br>
aspects of OTHER
<br>
&quot;religious&quot; beliefs.
<br>
<p>This tends to &quot;debunk&quot; the premise of &quot;Debunk All
<br>
Religiosity Equally&quot;,
<br>
but that should be obvious. (Would you propose to
<br>
attack all
<br>
philosophies equally? How about economic systems; are
<br>
they all
<br>
equally bad?)
<br>
<p>The book in question (&quot;Why God Won't Go Away...&quot; =
<br>
WGWGA) reveals
<br>
how under certain circumstances (meditation, etc.)
<br>
certain subsystems
<br>
of the brain temporarily &quot;shut down&quot; (and some others
<br>
work more
<br>
actively), and some of the subsystems that &quot;shut down&quot;
<br>
are associated
<br>
with defining the border between &quot;the Self&quot; and the
<br>
rest of the
<br>
universe. The authors propose that this explains why
<br>
the subject
<br>
experiences &quot;oneness with the universe&quot;, etc, yadda
<br>
yadda.
<br>
<p>What is important to realize is that the brain, in a
<br>
very real sense,
<br>
defines our experience of reality. All of our
<br>
experience with &quot;reality&quot;
<br>
is mediated by the systems of the brain. That the
<br>
brain can be in
<br>
different &quot;states&quot; at different times is obvious; what
<br>
is not obvious
<br>
is why one &quot;state&quot; should be considered &quot;a more
<br>
accurate representation
<br>
of reality&quot; than another.
<br>
<p>Obviously, SOME states can be argued &quot;a less accurate
<br>
representation&quot;
<br>
than others (death; sleep, etc.); but the kinds of
<br>
altered states that
<br>
are the focus of WGWGA involve heightened awareness of
<br>
surroundings,
<br>
improved abilities, greater senses of well-being, and
<br>
other things
<br>
that extropians should find desirable.
<br>
<p>The fact that, in these same experiences, the sense of
<br>
&quot;Self&quot; is
<br>
radically altered does not obviously relegate such
<br>
brain states to
<br>
the category of undesirable dementia. The notion of
<br>
&quot;self&quot; is really
<br>
a problem logically, as this list frequently
<br>
demonstrates, when the
<br>
subject of &quot;uploading&quot;, et cetera, come up.
<br>
<p>Are our hearts part of our selves, when they can be
<br>
replaced with
<br>
artifical pumps? Our lungs, are they part of
<br>
ourselves? We need them
<br>
to live, but then, we also need all the plants out
<br>
there that produce
<br>
the oxygen our lungs breathe, and we don't usually
<br>
think of THEM as
<br>
part of our &quot;self&quot;. We can't live without our local
<br>
star, the sun,
<br>
(yet); is it part of our &quot;self&quot;? We can live without
<br>
our left hand; is
<br>
it NOT part of our &quot;self&quot;? Just where does our &quot;self&quot;
<br>
end and the
<br>
rest of the universe begin?
<br>
<p>(Perhaps you should add &quot;the Self&quot; to your list of
<br>
useless hypotheses
<br>
in your signature line.)
<br>
<p>Thus, &quot;unusual&quot; brain states in which the boundaries
<br>
of our &quot;self&quot;
<br>
are radically altered are not neccessarily &quot;less
<br>
accurate
<br>
representations&quot; of reality. Perhaps they are like
<br>
different but
<br>
equally valid reference frames involved when doing
<br>
simple analyses
<br>
of the kinematics of playing tennis on a moving train,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>The &quot;usual&quot; sense of self no doubt won out in a
<br>
Darwinian sense
<br>
because it drives us to actions which ultimately
<br>
result in more
<br>
offspring, but then, obviously, so does the &quot;usual&quot;
<br>
state of our sex
<br>
drives.
<br>
<p>However, on this list, not less than Mr. Max More
<br>
himself has
<br>
expressed the desire to be able to temporarily turn
<br>
off his sex drive,
<br>
a desire I fully understand. It would be nice to be
<br>
free of the
<br>
whole darn tormenting thing.
<br>
<p>It is arguably a central premise of certain religions
<br>
that it is
<br>
nice to be rid of &quot;the whole darn tormenting thing&quot;
<br>
that is our
<br>
sense of being a separate &quot;Self&quot;, and that furthermore
<br>
such
<br>
freedom is possible.
<br>
<p>I put it to you that the findings of the authors of
<br>
WGWGA support
<br>
this bit of &quot;religiosity&quot;. Therefore, your mentioning
<br>
of this book,
<br>
in the context of &quot;Debunk All Religiosity Equally&quot;, is
<br>
wierd to me.
<br>
<p>I admit that the book in question (&quot;Why God Won't Go
<br>
Away&quot;) is 
<br>
annoying in the sense that it frequently goes out of
<br>
its way to present
<br>
its findings in the language of Western religion (the
<br>
title being an
<br>
example of this), but I assume you actually did more
<br>
than read the title.
<br>
<p>SAMANTHA ATKINS: I, like you, find the notion of
<br>
&quot;taking drastic measures&quot;
<br>
to drive out from society memes as fundamental as any
<br>
related to
<br>
&quot;religiosity&quot; a starkly frightening one, bringing to
<br>
mind book burning
<br>
and concentration camps. The last time I mentioned
<br>
this on the list,
<br>
I was shouted down. I have concluded that this list
<br>
will always be
<br>
a haven for the rabidly anti-religious, and have
<br>
accepted this flaw,
<br>
and hardly evey post, but just lurk. Other than that,
<br>
it (this list)
<br>
is an excellent source of ideas, provided you are
<br>
willing to skim through
<br>
the redundant repetitions and other muck. This list is
<br>
a useful filter.
<br>
<p>It is funny (to me) that this argument about religion
<br>
recurs on a yearly
<br>
basis on this list. &quot;Methinks he doth protest too much.&quot;
