<em>&gt; &gt;Regarding the open source movement, How does this differ from a free

market?
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;People cooperating and competing as they want sounds to me just like a
</em><br>
free
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;market.  I don't see how some people can see this as anti-free market.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who said it was anti-free-market? Much of the thinking is the same.
</em><br>
<p>I believe it was someone off list, which is why I did not name you or anyone
<br>
else in my post on the subject.  I think _most_ of the thinking is the same.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The 2
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophies dovetail nicely.
</em><br>
<p>Glad you agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, I see: you thought that because I am not totally committed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism that I am rabidly anti-free market.
</em><br>
<p>Of couse, I see:  you think that I think that, so you go on the attack.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And that I mentioned it as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to improve upon some of capitalism's failings then it must be being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposed as a competing anti-free-market philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>We've been there before.  In general, such improvements are not possible.
<br>
In general, interventionists have no way and little incentive to improve on
<br>
market outcomes.  They have no way because, imperfect as they are, market
<br>
outcomes are the best way of finding what people really want.  (See, e.g.,
<br>
Hayek's &quot;The Use of Knowledge in Society&quot; (at
<br>
<a href="http://www.virtualschool.edu/mon/Economics/HayekUseOfKnowledge.html">http://www.virtualschool.edu/mon/Economics/HayekUseOfKnowledge.html</a>), Henry
<br>
Hazlitt's _Economics in One Lesson_, Estaben Thomsen's _Prices and
<br>
Knowledge_, Roy Cordato's _Welfare Economics and Externalities in an Open
<br>
Ended Universe_, Sanford Ikeda's _Dynamics of the Mixed Economy_, and
<br>
Stephen Horwitz's _Microfoundations and Macroeconomics_ for more on this
<br>
information problem.  I recommend you start with Hayek's essay.)  Any
<br>
interference in this assumes that those interfering know better than the
<br>
participants themselves at the same time.  It's easy to look back and point
<br>
out faults, very hard to design a system that reduces faults beforehand.
<br>
(Think of it as playing a video game where you don't know what's going to
<br>
happen next, versus starting over after you know.  No economic system is
<br>
really in the latter position most of the time.  Instead, they all have to
<br>
deal with imperfect information, disequilibrium, and discoordinated plans.)
<br>
<p>They have little incentive because once you have the power to veto market
<br>
outcomes, you have the power to veto other people's choices, which means you
<br>
have the power to disregard other people's choices.  Once that happens, the
<br>
general outcome is those who have that power act to help themselves, their
<br>
allies, and whomever they deem important.  There's a whole school of
<br>
economics, Public Choice, dedicated to studying this problem.
<br>
<p>Combine the two together and what you get is a growing interference in the
<br>
market that leads to new problems that leads to further interferences in a
<br>
reinforcing cycle of intervention.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Certainly, the open source movement is open and not regulated by any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;government body.  Voluntary acceptance of standards and protocols is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;regulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Isn't even the grounding metaphor in Raymond's &quot;The Cathedral and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Bazaar&quot; (at <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/</a> ) for
</em><br>
open
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;source a market?  The bazaar?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly.
</em><br>
<p>Glad you agree in this area.  If it's true here, then why do you think
<br>
government regulation works elsewhere?  Rhetorical question, don't answer.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
