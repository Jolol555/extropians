<p>Yes. They do. Why do you think that is? I can tell you now that it is not, 
<br>
as you think, just envy. They hate what has been done by America in their 
<br>
own lands. They see violence and call for more of the same... just as you 
<br>
are doing.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;They hate western culture because it is based
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;religion, and collectivism.

<p>Have you ever talked to any muslim people?
<br>
This is not why some people hate USA at all. You are so wound up in the 
<br>
idealised version of USA, you think that is how the rest of the world sees 
<br>
you too. Please, please understand Jerry, you are very, very wrong.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;This is a war of ideas. We are fighting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an philosophy here.
</em><br>
<p>That is so true. This whole damn mess is about ideas.
<br>
If everybody would forget the ideas and see the *people* then they would 
<br>
see how futile the ideals are. These philosophies blind you to the reality. 
<br>
They make for fanatics. As Anders said, &quot;No ideas are worth dying or 
<br>
killing for.&quot;
<br>
If the idiots piloting those planes saw the *people* in the buildings 
<br>
instead of being blinded by ideals then the tragedy wouldn't have happened.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Bin laten is one little manifestation of that system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Kill him and 500 more will be cranked out. Its the system that needs to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;removed and ASAP.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. If you use guns and weapons of mass destruction you will 
<br>
perpetuate the system. A more subtle approach is needed -- one that removes 
<br>
the hold that the religious nutters have over the poor twits who are 
<br>
hoodwinked into becoming human bombs. You also need to remove the reason 
<br>
the religious nutters feel compelled to denounce USA. That partly means 
<br>
ensuring USA acts more responsibly in the world arena.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Those countries are the most luddite, anti-technology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anti-capitalist, anti-reason countries you could find.
</em><br>
<p>Ask yourself why that is.
<br>
Then ask yourself how that can be changed.
<br>
<p>You certainly won't make people in those places love and admire America by 
<br>
bombing the crap outa them. You will just ensure that the ones there who 
<br>
already love and admire America get lynched.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Why do they hate us? Well maybe if we don't look for a reason and address it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the problem will go away.
</em><br>
<p>Huh???
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Bin Laden needs to be dealt with, but what created him?
</em><br>
<p>Sadly, in a very real sense the USA created him.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;History is the battle of ideas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and if you don't support your own system with the full belief that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correct, they you are going consigned to the quagmire of guilt that so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around now seemed to be steeped in. The big enemies we should be fighting on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our front (as well as those foreign) are guilt and fear. Most of the guilt
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is because we still have in this age of moon walks and supercomputers, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we still possess the philosophy of cave men. Those that carry that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophy, and its a majority of people for the most part, deserve it and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the guilt.
</em><br>
<p>I am sure Bin Laden would agree entirely with that sentiment.
<br>
<p>That really frightens me Jerry -- you are speaking exactly as a dangerous 
<br>
fanatic would speak. Are you seriously suggesting that ideas are the 
<br>
important thing? That freedom from guilt and fear are the key to survival? 
<br>
You do realise that these are big reasons why most of the truly 
<br>
reprehensible deeds are able to be committed -- that the perpetrators are 
<br>
convinced that the ideas are more important than anything else and that 
<br>
they shouldn't feel guilty about what they have to do. Further that they 
<br>
don't feel fear of retribution.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
