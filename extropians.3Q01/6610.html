<em>&gt; This is the neolithic algorithm that is still in operation. It arose when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communities counted around ~100 individua, and went to war with neighbour

</em><br>
<p>Axelrod and Hamilton, when investigating Tit for Tat algorithms, found
<br>
that it apparently pays to be nice (not the first to defect), retaliatory
<br>
(not insensitive to defections), and forgiving (returning to niceness
<br>
after one retaliation).  &quot;Tit for Two Tats&quot; even came close to
<br>
outcompeting Tit for Tat.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, this fails to take politics into account.
<br>
<p>When its actions must be justified in front of a larger audience trying to
<br>
enforce justice, an evolved organism will overestimate the harm done to
<br>
itself by others, and underestimate the harm its own actions deal to
<br>
others.  Combine this with the tendency to value only the lives of your
<br>
own tribe and to count the enemy as dust, and the stage is indeed set for
<br>
suicide.  Conflicts of this sort did not &quot;peter out naturally&quot; so much as
<br>
they ended in the extinction of one tribe or the other.
<br>

<p>This is what I really, really object to about the talk of going to war
<br>
over the World Trade Center.  It may be worth going to war to prevent the
<br>
future nuclear bombing of New York.  But killing a hundred thousand Afghan
<br>
citizens to prevent ten future terrosist attacks costing an average of
<br>
five thousand American lives apiece would be bad mathematics even if it
<br>
worked.  Killing twenty thousand Afghani as *revenge* for an incident that
<br>
took five thousand American lives is bad mathematics, even if you believe
<br>
in revenge.
<br>
<p>If you want revenge for the World Trade Center, then drop a grand total of
<br>
THREE bombs on Afghanistan, killing no more than FIVE thousand Afghani. 
<br>
Nobody even suggests this.  They want war.
<br>
<p>And the part that makes it really appalling is that &quot;my fellow Americans&quot;
<br>
are not just talking about a vastly disproportionate revenge - because it
<br>
is revenge, as they see it - they are talking about taking this vast
<br>
revenge on a small country that is totally unable to retaliate in kind. 
<br>
Would America even consider invading Afghanistan if Afghanistan could turn
<br>
around and invade the US?  Of course not.  If we ourselves were some
<br>
dirt-poor Third World country located next to Afghanistan, we wouldn't
<br>
invade because we might get invaded in turn, and the World Trade Center
<br>
isn't worth that.  We would, as I said before, drop a grand total of three
<br>
bombs and kill five thousand Afghani, so that if the Afghani then decided
<br>
to retaliate for that, it would be a bearable blow.  The rhetoric about
<br>
grinding Afghanistan into rubble is not just aggression, it is bullying. 
<br>
We wouldn't be so disproportionate in our revenge if the target had any
<br>
hope of taking revenge in turn.
<br>
<p>Like I said, I'm not a pacifist.  I do think there are times when war is
<br>
necessary and justified.  But the sole possible justification for war
<br>
against Afghanistan (and Iraq!) is the elimination of rogue states as
<br>
breeding grounds for terrorists with weapons of mass destruction.  The
<br>
sole possible justification for war lies in things that haven't happened
<br>
yet, because the World Trade Center is not anywhere near as horrible as a
<br>
war.  And the part that disgusts me is not that human nature leads
<br>
countries to take disproportionate revenge, but that human nature leads
<br>
countries to take disproportionate revenge when they think they can get
<br>
away with it.
