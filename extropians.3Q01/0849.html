With regard to the Flynn effect, my understanding is that old people do
<br>
not have their IQ scores increase with time.  One quote I found is:
<br>
<p>: A widely held hypothesis is that people lose fluid intelligence as
<br>
: they age.  This phenomena is caused by comparing the IQ tests of elderly
<br>
: people with today's young people.  However, when compared to the IQ scores
<br>
: of youth in their own era ( a half a century before) the IQ losses with
<br>
: age are minimal (Raven, 1992, pp. G22-G26).
<br>
<p>from <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/flynneffect.html">http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/flynneffect.html</a>.
<br>
<p>However if we take this literally, and we assume a Flynn increase of
<br>
10-20 points every 30 years, it would mean that the average IQ of 45
<br>
year olds is 80-90 if we standardize the IQ of 15 year olds as 100.
<br>
Most teenagers would probably agree, but I don't think this is how
<br>
it works.  My understanding is that people's IQ is relatively stable
<br>
over most of their life and then declines somewhat in the later years.
<br>
<p>However it is all intimately tied to how the tests are scored and
<br>
normalized.  It could be that the &quot;stable IQ&quot; results are based on
<br>
using the same tests and scoring over the years, as that is arguably
<br>
the most reliable way to do a study over that long a time period.
<br>
This method would not show a putative Flynn &quot;IQ drop&quot; as that would
<br>
require renormalizing the tests as the years go by.
<br>
<p>Because the Flynn effect was not widely recognized in the past, it's
<br>
possible that some of these IQ studies weren't careful about how they
<br>
did the normalization.  The page above mentions some cases in which
<br>
incautious use of test norms from different years led to spurious reports
<br>
of IQ differences.  This may cause some confusion about how IQ actually
<br>
changes with age.
