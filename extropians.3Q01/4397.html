Wei Dai asked:
<br>
<em>&gt; I wonder if we might see anti-cloning technology that actually would work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example a genetically engineered self-destruct mechansism that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causes a cell's DNA to be wiped as soon as it is detached from the body.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How feasible would this be?
</em><br>
<p>I think its fairly easy.  You already have the apoptosis
<br>
program built into the cells.  That cuts up the DNA
<br>
rather quickly (less than an hour I'd guess -- Google
<br>
would probably tell you).  All you need is a detector
<br>
that could be keyed off of some set of changes such
<br>
as low glucose, low O2, low oxygen, or detachment
<br>
from the extracellular matrix.  I suspect there
<br>
are enough pre-built components that can sense
<br>
these things that you could workup a relatively
<br>
foolproof set of switches with a dozen or so genes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps another way to prevent cloning is to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure each cell only has the genes necessary for it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to function, instead of the whole genome. Then, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clone someone you would have to obtain a cell from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each of his organs. 
</em><br>
<p>I proposed something like this with my designer
<br>
chromosomes at Extro4.  Ideally you want organ
<br>
specific stem-cell designs because less DNA means
<br>
you expend less resources copying DNA useless for
<br>
the production of a specific organ, thus you can
<br>
grow replacement organs faster.
