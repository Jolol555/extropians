<p><em>&gt; I am a former teacher, and my experience shows that the people who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make the best teachers are those who are the least educated.
</em><br>
<p>But it doesn't have to be that way!  There are a lot of very 
<br>
educated and intelligent people who'd love to teach, but the
<br>
system isn't set up for them.  At least not anymore.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The &quot;smart&quot; ones, the ones who are interested in science, usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave the profession rather quickly (because they get tired of the abuse).
</em><br>
<p>Yes!  But you should be blaming the *abuse*, not anything else!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, the empirical evidence shows (at the empirical evidence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which *I* have access) that the halflife of a teacher's career is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inversely proportional to his/her IQ.  At least that was the case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at both schools at which I taught.  Of all the  teachers who came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into teaching when I did, the only ones still teaching are those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who are the least academic. And I mean, they are not really 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; academically inclined at *all*.
</em><br>
<p>It's because of all the shit they had to put up with, from administrators,
<br>
from parents, and most of all from students.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The main problem is that kids are even less rational than adults. Therefore 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in order to teach, one needs control.  And the erosion of teacher authority 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means that personal relationships are the key even being *able* to do *any* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teaching, never mind the science pipe dreams....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BTW, status relationships are crucial in the classroom.
</em><br>
<p>To a very large degree, this would get fixed by privatization.  Good
<br>
teachers would not have to put up with a lot of crap, and students 
<br>
who were ruining the experience for the other kids would be kicked
<br>
out.
<br>
<p>(For example:  Parent:  &quot;Johnny!  That's the third school you've
<br>
got kicked out of this year!  Now you are going to Drill Instructor
<br>
Deathwish's School on Monday, and if you can't make it there---it
<br>
will be military school in the mountains!!  You are costing me a
<br>
fortune!  WHY CAN'T YOU BEHAVE IN CLASS LIKE THE OTHER KIDS DO??&quot;)
<br>
<p>When you write &quot;one needs control&quot;, it is a comment on one hundred
<br>
years of socialized feel-good left-inspired public education.  It
<br>
really DOESN'T have to be that way.
