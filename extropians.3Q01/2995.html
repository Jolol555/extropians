<em>&gt; &gt; I'm not sure you have a complete grasp of the Sysop Scenario. It is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about &quot;forcing&quot; anything at all. No one is forced to modify their mind,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or live a libertarian life. The whole point is everyone is free to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what they want, live the way they want, etc. It is volition-based. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is about protecting what you want and how you want to live.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I would not call it a libertarian or any other society. Some people may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; form governments or societies inside of it, others may not participate at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all and focus on individual pursuits. Yet they all can still interact with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other without any possibility of stepping on each others toes (unless they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want their toes stepped on).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you miss my point: how does the Sysop Scenario prevent a group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people/entities using their &quot;freedom&quot; to dismantle the Sysop Scenario and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set up their own form of managing things in which people/entities have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom at all?
</em><br>
<p>Because the Sysop would prevent that. This is the ole &quot;setting up a Hell
<br>
sim world&quot; issue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only way that you can prevent this is through use of force and coercion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the Sysop.
</em><br>
<p>The only thing causing the coercion is your attempt to coerce someone else.
<br>
If you want to live a world where you can do that, you are going to be out
<br>
of luck. Are you trying to argue that the ability to coerce someone is some
<br>
how important?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (And my original point was that if you don't have the freedom to destroy the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society, then it's not a truly libertarian society, which is why a truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian society can't exist).
</em><br>
<p>Well you'll be glad to know that even in Sysop Space you can still get
<br>
rid of it. It just would require convincing the Sysop that this is the
<br>
most Friendly action.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have yet to see a better solution to the issue. At some point the matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (as in atoms) must fall under someone's control, and personally I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relish the idea of having to constantly protect myself from everyone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who can't be trusted with nanotech and AI. All it takes is one Blight to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wipe us out. That kind of threat does not go away as humans progress to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanity, rather it increases in likelihood. What is the stable state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if not Sysop or total death? There may be some other possibilities, can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you name some?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The most likely outcome is just as it is now -- you will be constantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having to protect yourself from entities that can't be trusted. Just that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tech involved will be somewhat more sophisticated. It's dynamism in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action -- things constantly changing. The Sysop Scenario sounds like wishful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socialist central-planning type thinking...although there's nothing to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that central planning couldn't work if you have sufficient processing power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it's not a free society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I think you have too rosy colored glasses on. In a transhuman world, not
<br>
only the tech is changing but the minds are too. The only way to fully
<br>
protect yourself would be to be as smart as the smartest individual.
<br>
Otherwise, they can invent something you can't defend against. This is
<br>
an unstable situation unless everyone somehow achieves the same
<br>
permanent level of intelligence and tech capabilities. Even then you may
<br>
have issues like groups ganging up on one individual. It's just a huge
<br>
mess of a future, at least potentially.
<br>
<p>A Sysop Scenario has ZERO to do with central planning. It is no more
<br>
centrally planned than our current USA system is centrally planned-
<br>
actually it would be quite a bit better than the USA system which
<br>
still has a bunch of central one-size-fits-all laws, etc. Everyone
<br>
living in it is ABSOLUTELY FREE, except they can't mess with anyone
<br>
who doesn't want to be messed with. I still think you have some large
<br>
misconceptions of what I'm describing.
