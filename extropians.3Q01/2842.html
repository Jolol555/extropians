<em>&gt; Falsely accusing others of racism is worse than irrational memes. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; malicious, vindictive, and salacious. I suspect the underlying reason for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objection to the Fred Reed spoof is that it so effectively illustrates the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absurdity of the reparation schemes
</em><br>
<p>I see plenty of cause to object to Reed's &quot;spoof&quot; independent of 
<br>
his position on reparation.  And while I can't definitively speak 
<br>
for other posters internal motivations, I've seen nothing so far 
<br>
that supports your suspicion.
<br>
<p>My own view of &quot;reparations&quot; is that holding me liable for the 
<br>
crimes of long-dead slave owners is no more rational than holding 
<br>
the descendents of the slaves responsible.  I have no more 
<br>
control over those events than they do.  This &quot;reparations 
<br>
silliness&quot; is much more than just silliness.  It vilifies modern 
<br>
day whites not for doing something wrong, but just for being the 
<br>
same race as someone who did something wrong.  And it gives 
<br>
preferential treatment to modern day blacks not for being 
<br>
oppressed, but just for being the same race as someone who was 
<br>
oppressed.  This, in itself, is racially motivated injustice.
<br>
<p>I recognize that these are some of the same points that Mr. Reed 
<br>
was making in his article.  And I recognized when he was 
<br>
demonstrating the absurdity of &quot;guilt by association&quot; by 
<br>
reversing the roles.  But he played the role reversal so well 
<br>
that it left me with the uneasy feeling that the sarcasm might 
<br>
have been only a thin disguise for genuinely held views.  I don't 
<br>
know enough about Mr. Reed to know whether he is racist.  But the 
<br>
impression, even if accidental, is strong enough to be patently 
<br>
obvious to me even though I agree with his main argument.
<br>
<p>If anything, I think that being on the same side of the 
<br>
reparations issue only serves to increase the article's 
<br>
offensiveness to me.  A certain well worn phrase that begins 
<br>
&quot;With friends like that,....&quot; comes to mind.

<p>The future is ours to create.
