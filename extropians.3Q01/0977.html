<em>&gt; No, seriously, isn't it true that after you explain what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean by &quot;non-theist&quot; that they think to himself, &quot;oh, he's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an atheist&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>No, because generally I begin by attacking belief itself, not the object of
<br>
belief. Thus, I usually state that I want to debunk &quot;religiosity&quot; not a
<br>
particular religion or mythical supreme being. Most often they think (to
<br>
themselves or out loud) &quot;Oh, you're just playing with words!&quot; To which I
<br>
reply, It's dangerous to play with words, especially if you don't know that
<br>
some words need copious and serious debunking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will grant that &quot;non-theist&quot;, or even the old reliable &quot;I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not religious&quot; is perhaps more polite.  For some people, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitely WILL be more polite, because they take the &quot;A&quot; word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a slap in the face.  Well, this is a case where plain-speaking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trumps excess politeness, if you ask me.  People should simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get used to the idea that a lot of people are atheists.
</em><br>
<p>An alternative to &quot;non-theist&quot; is &quot;no religious preference&quot; which is even more
<br>
neutral. It tends to imply, by analogy, &quot;this person can see clearly, no
<br>
corrective lenses needed&quot; however presumptuous that may seem to those who do
<br>
need corrective lenses.
<br>
<p>©¿©¬
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
