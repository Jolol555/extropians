</em><br>
<p>Sources please?  The Florida Legislature is wasting time changing this law,
<br>
because they seem to be under the same opinion I am that the law is still
<br>
valid and should be changed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They also allowed the Republican party to &quot;correct&quot; 20,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absentee ballots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that did not include the required identification numbers on
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these votes should have been excluded.  By law, these votes

<em>&gt; &gt; been in possession of Republicans outside the election system.  By law,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these votes should not have been altered.  But the Republicans did it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) the 'corrections' were not in the way the voters voted, but in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ballots were supposed to be printed with their voter ID numbers on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them already. Most voters voting in absentia have no means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determining their voter ID numbers, it is the responsibility of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state to provide them. To penalize the voters for the actions of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state is an illegal disenfranchisement, as the courts ruled.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) the ballots were never outside the election system. The GOP provided
</em><br>
<em>&gt; staff to write in the voter ID numbers on government premises.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; c) Votes were NEVER altered.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, with a couple of clarifications.  They did not change the votes (as
<br>
far as we know), but it was still illegal.  The votes were cast and then
<br>
given to the Republican party which then later resubmitted them to be
<br>
counted.  They were originally rejected as invalid and then after being
<br>
changed, were accepted.  This is illegal.  Votes, even outer envelopes,
<br>
cannot be changed after a voter submits it.  Votes also cannot leave the
<br>
control of the election system, go to one political party, and then be
<br>
recast.  Also not that they only did this with Republican votes, not
<br>
Democratic votes.  The reason is that the voting materials were provided by
<br>
the Republican Party which left of the voter ID numbers.  Had they been the
<br>
real ballots printed by the State of Florida, they would have been valid.
<br>
The State did not screw these ballots up, the Republican Party did.  I agree
<br>
that the votes were probably not altered because they were Republican voters
<br>
only and presumably voted for Bush.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The Republicans also fought &quot;for&quot; recounts in some counties where they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thought they would improve, like Volusia county, and &quot;against&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recounts in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other counties where they thought they would win.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but in no instance did they insist on ballot counting rules that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deviated from those in place on election day, as I said before and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignored.
</em><br>
<p>Yes they did.  They argued that the State Law called for a recount on the
<br>
day of the election, but that Harris was not bound to use these recounts
<br>
later.  They reverted back to the original counts for some counties where it
<br>
benefited Bush.  Although state law required the recount on the day of the
<br>
election, they changed the requirement for the recount later.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, somewhere between 4-6 million ballots were thrown out, including a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple hundred thousand alone in the Illinois County that is home to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gore's campaign chairman, old 'Two Vote' Daley.
</em><br>
<p>You must not be aware that many of the Republican ballots that were fixed
<br>
duplicated votes.  When the ballots were thought to be invalid, many
<br>
republicans went to the polls and voted in person.  These voters got to vote
<br>
twice.  When they accepted the fixed ballots later, there were computer
<br>
problems with the Republican party records of the fixed votes, such that
<br>
they couldn't verify that Republican votes didn't count twice.  Rather than
<br>
throw out some valid votes, they won a court case to allow all the votes,
<br>
including duplicate Republican votes, to count in the system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The spoilsport antics of the rent-a-riot left wing at the inauguration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and since have continued to help Bush by casting the left as too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; immature to lead, and too shrilly extremist to represent the people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is too funny.  The Republicans did the same thing in Miami
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; flew in paid participants for their riot.  Both sides do the exact same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thing, and yet most people only recall the poor behavior on one side.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Show me footage of a republican 'riot'. Only one instance did they stage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a peaceful protest, outside the Dade recount places, where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; republicans in the room noticed no disturbances. The democrats claimed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was a 'riot' only because they didn't like the fact that someone was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrating 'against' them, which was 'obviously' staged by 'racist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bigoted, sexist, right-wing wackos'.
</em><br>
<p>Mike, you can nitpick words all you want.  The Miami county officials tried
<br>
to move the ballot boxes through the hallway with all the yelling
<br>
protestors.  They could not get through.  They crowd was not outside, they
<br>
were physically blocking the hallway where the ballots were being carried.
<br>
They refused to allow the officials through.  After repeated requests to
<br>
allow them through, the officials gave up and said that they could not
<br>
finish the recount because the yelling crowd of paid republican
<br>
demonstrators were physically blocking their access to the recount room.
<br>
This may not have been a riot, but it was a physical disruption of the
<br>
election process by paid members of Republican congressional staffers who
<br>
were flown down specifically for this purpose.  Nitpicking on whether it was
<br>
a riot or not misses the point.  They paid protestors and flew them in to
<br>
disrupt a legal process, and it worked.  You can't blame Democrats for
<br>
paying protestors and claim that Republicans don't do the same thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is one more instance of a liberal claiming a crime occurs only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they 'felt intimidated', not that any actually intimidating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior actually occurred. Much like blacks protesting police checking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for outstanding warrants on the election day. Since felons can't vote,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its obvious that only those who are felons should be worried about their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to commit vote fraud being impaired.
</em><br>
<p>The problem wasn't that felons were kept from voting.  The problem was that
<br>
many non-felon blacks were mistakenly marked as felons and kept from voting.
<br>
This was done by a Texas right-wing group that worked for Jeb Bush who came
<br>
in and volunteered to mark black felons in the computer systems.  They
<br>
screwed up and blocked all blacks with any police record, not just felony
<br>
records.  Many blacks, including state legislators(!) were denied their
<br>
right to vote because they were marked as felons.  This is a valid complaint
<br>
for them to make.  It is not just that they felt intimidated.
