<em>&gt; Anyone like my new subject line? lol  I have found this thread very thought- provoking though this topic is very recurring around here...  Personally, I agree with Samantha that a person in our age does not yet have enough information to be absolutely 100% certain all religious/spiritual beliefs are ultimately false and that there is no God and/or afterlife.  But, perhaps even centuries from now the absolute answers will not be in yet.

Hey, good idea!  I edited the subject line a bit, too.  If &quot;intolerant&quot; means not believing in something until there is good, hard (corroborated) evidence, then count me in - I'm intolerant of not believing in something until there is hard (corroborated) evidence.  I'm intolerant of spanking children.  I'm intolerant of Nazis. And there are a few other things of which I am intolerant.  Each one of my intolerances (some of them attracted me right away; some of them required deeper thought) EARNED my disdain in some way.  In other words, the word &quot;intolerant&quot; cannot just be thrown around without some qualifier (some people do this in the Northwest where I live with another word:  &quot;respect&quot; - i.e., &quot;don't disrespect me!&quot; - as if one has to &quot;respect&quot; all opinions equally (I think many people mix up the idea of RESPECTING THE RIGHT to hold opinions v.  having their OPINIONS RESPECTED).   
<br>
<p>I believe it was Bertrand Russell once said, why, suuuuuuuuuuuuure, he'll entertain the possibility of fine porcelain teacups and saucers going around as the rings of Saturn (it's been a long time since I read this story - but the essence is what I remember), but ... in extrapolating he knows and what is known about the world ... until he's presented with some verifiable/falsifiable proof of those teacups and saucers - he won't believe any such thing.  Bertie the Intolerant, tsk, tsk.

<br>
<p>Was Bertie intolerant?
