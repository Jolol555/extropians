</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, it doesn't apply to you, then, if you don't so strongly

</em><br>
<em>&gt; point that it suppresses your own unique individuality.  I'll
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well obviously I am all of those things but I they are not in
<br>
any way blown so out of proportion that me the indivudal is
<br>
somehow subjugated to them, which was your contention.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the more difficult question is:  to what degree do you feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more comfortable with others who are women and lesbians (not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redundant, it turns out)?  Here is the horror:  you *do* have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more in common with them and so *must* have *some* comfort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; derived from that.  There is the fiendish &quot;reverberant doubt&quot;,
</em><br>
<p>How on earth is this a &quot;horror&quot;?  It is quite simply to be
<br>
expected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; a notion derived from what Hofstadter wrote about some game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory tableux:  when not with a woman or a lesbian, you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to wonder, &quot;does this person see me as different and perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot help but doing so and is perhaps asking him/herself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;does this person see me as different and perhaps cannot help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but doing so and is perhaps asking him/herself &quot;does this person...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't follow you there at all or see any horror there.  It is
<br>
a pointless game worrying about such things.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; At times the divisiveness brought about by membership in groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems so inescapable, that, since these &quot;wonderful differences&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so glorified by the preachers of diversity are intrinsically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unimportant and pointless to begin with, perhaps we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all separate into our own little groups.  Then we just wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to have anything to do with each other, except in a celebrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formal capacity (the way that foreigners are treated in Japan), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could escape these frictions, and &quot;reverberant doubt&quot;.  Even better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be if we all had total freedom to choose our race and gender,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and could default to &quot;mongrel&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Why unimportant and pointless?  Why would going from labelling
<br>
and treating based on labels overly much be improved by refusing
<br>
to notice differences at all or to grant them any importance? 
<br>
Friction by itself is not utterly bad.  Your &quot;reverberant doubt&quot;
<br>
is actually pointless.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Of course, the world is becoming a place where it doesn't matter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as you start to say here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is no longer a world where separatism and xenophobia are very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; workable.  So, to some degree, we need to get over it while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; preserving our ability to be as different as we are and as like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as we are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, that seems correct to me.  Wish us all luck, because we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are going to need it, pace Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Is it luck we need?
<br>
<p>-s.
