I. William Wiser said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Here is a question that has bugged me off and on for years.
</em><br>
<p>Me too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What ways of handling property rights and especially land rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seem most reasonable for people who value individual liberty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the well being of people in general?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I like the idea that something becomes yours when it is laying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around and you mix your labor with it or otherwise consistently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make it a part of your possessions.  Once something becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yours it stays yours until you abandon it or transfer it in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way.  Contracts can modify this as in work for hire, etc.
</em><br>
<p>I think these are reasonable rules of thumb in *many* cases. However, as a 
<br>
legal positivist, I would not say &quot;something becomes yours&quot;. I would say &quot;it 
<br>
is morally reasonable to have a law norm (which may be traditional law, 
<br>
enforceable social custom, etc not necesarily law explicitly created by the 
<br>
state) that something becomes yours&quot;. I'd also say that it may not be 
<br>
morally reasonable in *all* cases.
<br>
<p>Saying that it *just does* become your property sounds metaphysical to me. 
<br>
You've essentially described Locke's theory of property, which, in this 
<br>
form, I find highly unconvincing, and Nozick's theory of justice. If Locke's 
<br>
theory is simply stated as a politico-moral principle, without bringing in 
<br>
ideas of reasonableness (and ultimately, I'm afraid, ethical intuitions), it 
<br>
raises the question, &quot;why?&quot;. As Nozick said in his early work (when he was 
<br>
an unequivocal libertarian and wanted to accept the Lockean theory, or 
<br>
something like it) why doesn't mingling my labour with something simply 
<br>
disperse my labour, rather than make the something mine? The answer is 
<br>
surely that in a lot of cases we think it reasonable for this to happen. Our 
<br>
ideas of reasonableness may be based, in turn, on concepts such as desert, 
<br>
though there's a trap here, I reckon. I have a tentative view that the 
<br>
notion of &quot;desert&quot; is an illusion - that it has at least as much claim as 
<br>
the notion of &quot;the ego&quot; to belong on J.R.'s list of useless hypotheses.
<br>
<p>I've been thinking a lot about this during the week, trying to work out what 
<br>
separates me from people whose views I respect but whom I think of as 
<br>
hardline (choose some other adjective is this is thought to have negative 
<br>
connotations, &quot;consistent&quot; perhaps) libertarians, such as Daniel and many 
<br>
others on this list. In most company, I would be called a libertarian 
<br>
thinker, perhaps pejoratively - I believe in both social liberty (lifestyle, 
<br>
thoughts, belief, expression, etc) and economic liberty (I am emphatically 
<br>
no socialist). I like the little slogan that I made up on another thread: 
<br>
&quot;Live long! Live free!&quot; But I believe that it can be reasonable to have laws 
<br>
allowing for government expenditure and the taxes that support it (even if I 
<br>
often consider specific such laws to be a waste of money etc). I don't think 
<br>
that property rights are inviolable. A lot of what prevents me going that 
<br>
extra step is that I cannot accept that the supposed foundations of formal 
<br>
large-L Libertarian thought are genuine foundations.
<br>
<p>(I also think that my wishy-washy libertarian viewpoint is a lot more useful 
<br>
for people like Damien, Samantha, Olga and Miriam - and a lot less 
<br>
potentially alienating to most ordinary voters etc - than the various much 
<br>
more purist viewpoints being pressed by Lee, Daniel, Mike, Ralf, Jerry, etc. 
<br>
However, that does *not* mean I am correct and they are incorrect. If I have 
<br>
managed to cast doubt on their views, it is in ealier paras of this post and 
<br>
in the questions I asked Jerry in earlier posts.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;This works fairly well for small items and stuff that involves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a lot of labor.  But what about large tracts of land, mineral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights, etc.  If a small bit of land lays unclaimed and you claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it, work it, build a home on it etc. it makes sense to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it becomes yours and stays yours as long as you do not forfeit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it by abusing your neighbors in some way.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I'd say it is often/usually reasonable to have a legal norm of this 
<br>
kind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't see why people get to claim large amounts of land unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they do something with it which gets most people in the area to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decide not to contest their claim.  Obviously this can be done
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with military force but that only last as long as the force lasts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Contracts and agreements can last longer because most everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;needs a good reputation to thrive in this world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't want to speculate on this to much because it may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been worked out well by others but I would like to have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clear conception in my mind.  I think this makes for an important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political issue.  Whose land rights do I see as valid and what sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of land rights ideas do I want to propagate.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have clear answers to the questions your raising and suspect, as you 
<br>
say below, that there are &quot;no general solutions&quot; (as opposed to actual legal 
<br>
norms - but you're talking about what *should* be the norms, I take it).
<br>
<p>There is a vast amount of political philosopy and jurisprudential analysis 
<br>
which deals with these issues. One book that I recommend as a starting point 
<br>
(though one that a lot of extrolisters would probably consider far too 
<br>
socialist in its approach) is Stephen R. Munzer, _A Theory of Property_ 
<br>
(Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 1990). The citations in this will take 
<br>
you deeply into the issues if you want to follow them up.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There may be no general solutions but only rules of thumb and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;traditions people buy into.  It may be more a matter of working
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out something everyone with power can live with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I can't expect that anything which violates and individual's survival
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or well being, will be accepted by that individual.  Neither can I expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everyone or anyone to structure things for the benefit of particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individuals or groups.  The ideal system gets everyone who is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a position to contest it meaningfully to buy in.  Some people may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not buy it at first but a good system will be one that sane people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;buy into given time.
</em><br>
<p>This sounds sensible to me.
<br>
<p>Best wishes
<br>
<p>Russell
