Mark quoted:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Actually, I do find that I can get by from day to day making very few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; *moral* judgments, as opposed to having personal responses, tastes, etc.
</em><br>
<p><p>And commented...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I wonder what you might say about, e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1. The 20-60 million Soviet citizens that Stalin had eliminated in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Gulag. I know you want to resist saying that what he did was morally wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so what do you say? What Stalin did was, what? Gauche?
</em><br>
<p>Well, first, I said that I get by from day to day without making many moral
<br>
judgments. I didn't say I *never* make substantive moral judgments.
<br>
<p>Since it is damn hard to reconstruct language, I'd actually say that what
<br>
Stalin did was morally wrong.  :)
<br>
<p>However, I'd have to add, if the conversation got more complex, that I am
<br>
not claiming there is an objective property of moral wrongness, and I'd
<br>
acknowledge that, to the extent my language implies there is such a
<br>
property, it is misleading. I am appalled at the acts of Hitler, Stalin,
<br>
etc, but this is based on my own values, not on a serious claim that their
<br>
actions had some objective metaphysical property of &quot;wrongness&quot;. *That* is
<br>
not what I react to when I have a moral response to such actions.
<br>
<p>I add that it often turns out that people who did things I find appalling
<br>
have wildly wrong factual, or quasi-factual (perhaps metaphysical) beliefs.
<br>
Hitler thought that the Jews were sub-human, had inferior blood, were
<br>
parasites, culture destroyers, were engaged in destructive conspiracies
<br>
against the rest of humankind, etc, etc. Given these beliefs, some of his
<br>
prescriptions may have been arguable from values many of us would share.
<br>
This suggests to me that some memes of a supposedly factual nature are
<br>
nonetheless incredibly dangerous and destructive. Hypothetical imperative:
<br>
*if* we wish to avoid such outcomes (as I do), we should oppose these memes
<br>
strongly. I take racism very seriously. Similar, though more difficult,
<br>
issues arise with Stalin.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;2.  Do you see any _significant_ difference between treating people as
</em><br>
means
<br>
<em>&gt;and ends? Obviously there is no moral difference as far as your concerned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Is this a distinction without a difference for you?
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you are asking me whether I have any values other than
<br>
self-interest, and whether these include valuing the rationality, autonomy
<br>
etc of other people, or valuing other people's happiness, yes I do value
<br>
these things. I recognise them as moral constraints on my actions in the
<br>
sense that if I seek to act on my values I will sometimes act in ways that
<br>
are not self-interested (except in a trivial sense) or merely spontaneous.
<br>
<p>Thus, as an ethical subjectivist (or an error theorist if I follow Mackie in
<br>
thinking that ordinary ethical language has an  objectivist element built
<br>
into it), I can still recognise constraints on my self-interested or
<br>
spontaneous actions. Such contraints are at the core of normative ethics. If
<br>
there are some things that my values and commitments constrain me from doing
<br>
self-interestedly or spontaneously to other people, this entails that I am
<br>
constrained from treating those people *merely* as ends (which is what Kant
<br>
actually said). I have a reason, other than self-interest, to treat them in
<br>
certain ways.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;3.  Why do you think that you and your ilk
</em><br>
<p>I have an &quot;ilk&quot; now, do I? &lt;g&gt;  I realise that &quot;ilk&quot; just means something
<br>
like &quot;kind&quot;, but this expression is often used, these days, to express
<br>
disgust or contempt. Jeeze, I hope that's not the case here.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;should revise our language to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attempt to expunge moral claims?
</em><br>
<p><p>&quot;should&quot; in what sense? Are you suggesting that there is some categorical
<br>
imperative on the loose? *If* I want to be accurate, then I will be
<br>
interested (all other things being equal) in using language that is
<br>
accurate. This is a hypothetical imperative dependent on my own values. I
<br>
don't understand what is supposed to be wrong with that. By the way, I am
<br>
not a *relativist*. I am certainly not a truth-relativist. I think you *can*
<br>
be accurate about these things, even if an accurate statement turns out to
<br>
be inconvenient in some way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would have thought that you would prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to use moral language to attempt to manipulate others--to get them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;acquiesce to your preferences--given that so many others believe in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;myth&quot; of moral claims.
</em><br>
<p>But why assume that I am motivated purely by self-interest (except perhaps
<br>
in some trivial sense)? Perhaps I actually value the truth about these
<br>
issues more than getting others to acquiesce in my other value
<br>
preferences. Ethical subjectivism is a meta-ethical position; it does not,
<br>
without more, entail the rejection of any particular normative ethical
<br>
position. The error theory is simply the theory that our usual ethical
<br>
language is permeated by ethical realist or objectivist thinking, coupled
<br>
with a rejection of the existence of objective moral properties. It does not
<br>
entail the rejection of particular normative ethical positions if they are
<br>
reconstructed as subjectivist positions.
<br>
<p>Having said that, I do not entirely agree with what seems to be the
<br>
philosophical orthodoxy that meta-ethical theories leave everything
<br>
normative *just as it was*. I think that subjectivists and error theorists
<br>
are likely to reason about normative ethical matters in a way that is subtly
<br>
different from that of ethical realists. Of course, &quot;subtly&quot; is an important
<br>
word,
<br>
here. Then again, subtle differences in approach can compound to large
<br>
substantive differences.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wouldn't it be more _effective_ for you to pretend
<br>
<em>&gt;that it is immoral for others to interfere with your liberty to pursue your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;own version of the good, even though you are privy to the truth that moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discourse is a sham? Why not keep the moral language and use it as a mask
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt;hide your will to power?
</em><br>
<p>More &quot;effective&quot; for what end that you imagine I seek? As it happens, one of
<br>
my deepest commitments is to freedom. However, I don't believe that an
<br>
objective moral property of &quot;goodness&quot; attaches to freedom.
<br>
<p>Besides, if I masked my meta-ethical views, I couldn't have discussions like
<br>
this, could I? Well, I suppose I could, but the discussion would be
<br>
unsatisfying if I did not reveal my actual views. Perhaps power isn't all I
<br>
want.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;    Moi? I am a skeptic--at least I think I am. Error theorists like
</em><br>
Mackie,
<br>
<em>&gt;seem to me, presuppose way too much knowledge of Being. I am inclined to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think that there may be more things in heaven and earth than our dreamed of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in our human, all too human, philosophy. If one is a skeptic like me then
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt;is appropriate to reason as follows: If there are moral facts or
</em><br>
properties,
<br>
<em>&gt;and we reason and act if there are such, then we will be better off. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there are no moral facts or properties, and we reason and act if there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such, then we will be better off. Why? Because to think there might be
</em><br>
moral
<br>
<em>&gt;truths is comforting, and it will tend to make everyone behave better.
</em><br>
<p>Mark's version of Pascal's wager, then?
