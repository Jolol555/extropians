<p><em>&gt; But beyond any question of whites being cheated, let us return to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position of blacks in colleges. What percentage of college admissions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are blacks taking? Is there any chance of blacks suddenly becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over-represented in student bodies? I don't think so. You'd probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to enroll twice as many black students before you achieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proportionality with the general population.
</em><br>
<p>At the University of California at Berkeley a couple of years back,
<br>
Asians constituted 55% of freshman admissions.  I do not believe
<br>
that the admissions criteria were biased in their favor, nor that in
<br>
any way they were the beneficiaries of &quot;positive&quot; discrimination.
<br>
Now Asians constitute about 7% of the California population.  They
<br>
obtained the above level of admission based upon individual achievement/
<br>
qualifications.
<br>
<p>Therefore, just which group do you think *should* be under-represented?
<br>
Or would you prefer that a miracle occur, and that percentages sum to
<br>
more than one-hundred?  But perhaps, instead, you believe that there
<br>
should be an exact quota for each racial division, i.e., the number
<br>
of admissions for a particular year should be exactly proportional
<br>
to the number of babies that some group was able to grind out in
<br>
some preceding year?  If you do *not* favor exact quotas, in exact
<br>
accordance with general population figures, then I am afraid that
<br>
avoiding under-representation of some group is inevitable.  If so,
<br>
which group should be under-represented?  Surely you don't think
<br>
that whites alone should be selected against just because they
<br>
carry collective guilt for practically all of the evils of the 
<br>
world (rhetorical question)?
