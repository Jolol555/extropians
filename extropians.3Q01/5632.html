</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sparked a memory in my mind of a very attractive young
</em><br>
<em>&gt; white woman roller skating around Greenlake the other day.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most striking thing about her was the large tattoo that she had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; covering most of her arms and shoulders.  She was someone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously viewed her body as a canvas on which designs could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; painted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now switch to genetic engineering -- control of skin color has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be regulated by a very few genes.  That would suggest that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within a decade or so it should be feasible to pop a pill that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regulates how dark you are.  (Caucasians can already put on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suntan lotion that activates their endogenous tanning response).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now I would guess that tattoos are not as effective on dark skinned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people due to the lack of contrast.  That would suggest that such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people would utilize genetic means to lighten their skin to allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to take advantage of tatooing.  Eventually we will get dynamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control of skin color (though this will take a while).
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I'll buy the (post)(trans)human billboard idea.  But when we get
<br>
dynamic control of skin color, I would assume the &quot;contrast&quot; could go both
<br>
ways - i.e., canvases don't all need to have a white background (black
<br>
tattoos would contrast with white skin, and white tattoos would contrast
<br>
with black skin).  I realize there will be an array of other color
<br>
combinations, but I'm only tackling the dark/light example you brought up.
<br>
<p>Not attributing this to you, Robert, but it seems many white people think
<br>
that if people with darker skins had the choice, they'd choose to be &quot;white&quot;
<br>
or &quot;whiter.&quot;  As if darker skin is somehow defective?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So isn't the debate kind of meaningless?  Skin color will no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a useful marker for the identification of people as belonging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a particular &quot;clan&quot;.  It seems to me that language is becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the key factor for the &quot;bin-ing&quot; of people you encounter rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; color.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly, the debate may be meaningless at some point in the future.  But
<br>
bin-ning still goes on, in spite of language, and in spite of uniforms.  A
<br>
black woman I know was recently telling me a story of her sister, who is a
<br>
doctor.  Over and over again this doctor has been mistaken for a cleaning
<br>
woman - EVEN THOUGH she was wearing a uniform with her name, followed by
<br>
M.D.  And it happened to her recently again in the bathroom, when a white
<br>
woman came up to the doctor and started talking to her about a plumbing
<br>
problem in one of the stalls.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And of course discussing policy based on any expectations about what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2050 is going to be like seems silly.  We know that 2050 is going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be very different from any possible pictures of it we have today.
</em><br>
<p>Granted.  But I am concerned for this year, and the next, and the next ...
<br>
the quality of people's lives now.  (Although I'm excited about the
<br>
possibilities to come, as well.)
