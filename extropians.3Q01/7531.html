<p>Quite so. Sorry, I should have made it clear that my own interest in
<br>
raising the topic is that I want to plug such a gadget into a post-Spike
<br>
future sf novel, which allows me a measure of near-magic physics to help
<br>
with drilling and sustaining the tunnel (exotic matter, maybe, how would I
<br>
know). But I don't wish to shrug away *all* known physics with, say, an
<br>
anti-inertial drive or teleport system.
<br>
<p>I find it amusing that some here think the trip will be weightless, others
<br>
that the difference in weight will hardly be noticed. So much for physical
<br>
intuition. :)
<br>
<p>Alex Eremenko, whose site I ref'd, points out to me that
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Indeed, the one-way travel time of a gravity train is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exactly 1/2 of the time of orbiting the Earth on a low orbit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is easy to figure out without any calculation once the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fact that the travel time is independent on the destination
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is established. Indeed, conssider the travel to the antipodal point
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(through the center of the Earth). This is the limiting case of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a Kepler orbit, it can be thought as a very long and thin ellipse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;According to the Third Kepler Law, the time depends only of the long
</em><br>
<em>&gt;axis of the ellipse. But this long axis is the radius of the Earth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the same as for a low circular orbit.
</em><br>
<p>He also commented:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Speaking of the passengers sensation during the trip, they will depend on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the distance traveled. For example, on a train from Chicago to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Detroit they will feel almost nothing special.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As the distance increases they will feel some decrease of their weight,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and in the extreme case, a travel through the center of the Earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(the longest trip possible, to an antipodal point) they will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;completely weightless (like in a space orbital trip)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ALL THE TIME OF THE TRIP.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There will be never any weight increase in any of these trips, only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some loss of weight, longer the trip, larger the loss.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The weight loss will not be constant during the trip[...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One more remark: the gravity train running on a chord is not the fastest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible one. It only has an amazing property that the time of the travel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does not depend on the distance. The fastest possible gravity train
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will describe a more complicated curve inside the Earth called
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the brachistochrone, and in this case the time of the travel will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;depend on the distance. Actually the chape of this brachistochrone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was computed by Newton in his &quot;Principia&quot;, but of course he did not mention
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trains.
