<p>
<em>&gt; Think about the implications: since it is therefore impossible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent all passengers from being armed unless we choose to live in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; big brother police state, we MUST have armed people on every flight.
</em><br>
<p>I completely agree.  Terrorists will always find ways to get weapons on a
<br>
plane, or use seemingly harmless objects as weapons.  Imagine two pens,
<br>
held between the knuckles, and rammed through the pilot's eyeballs with a
<br>
Three Stooges punch.  Or better yet, the terrorists could be trained in
<br>
martial-arts neck-snapping, which is invisible to all detectors.  Sky
<br>
Marshalls would be a minimal deterrent, since there will always be a
<br>
sneaky way to disable them.
<br>
<p>A grenade-proof, airtight cockpit would help.  So would ground control
<br>
overrides, which could be made much more secure than the plane itself.
<br>
There could be many bunkers, each using a different encryption algorithm.
<br>
They could collectively take control of a plane after a suspicious course
<br>
change, a signal from the pilot, etc.  Maybe the ground stations could be
<br>
in control by default, with each plane's controls in a locked box and the
<br>
pilots riding incognito with the passengers.  The pilots could have ways
<br>
of instantly making themselves and the lock-boxes useless to terrorists.
<br>
Since many crashes are caused by pilot error, computer control might
<br>
actually be safer.  Computers could also work 24-7 without being crank
<br>
addicts.  For a rapid emergency response, passengers could have terrorism
<br>
buttons which also activate cameras throughout the plane.  A short-term
<br>
fix might be a FEMA number written on every seat back, so those with cell
<br>
phones can call in directly.  No time wasted with agency-hopping goose
<br>
chases by phone.
<br>
<p>These methods could work, but for sheer robustness, it is hard to beat
<br>
armed passengers.  Maybe AK-47s should be disallowed, since you don't want
<br>
much hull-piercing ability in the hands of the drunken baboons who
<br>
sometimes go berserk on flights.  I would feel most safe if all
<br>
passengers could borrow stun guns and swords at the gate.  Unfortunately,
<br>
this is politically impossible.
<br>
<p>For those out there collecting useful ideas to send to the government,
<br>
consider this one:
<br>
<p>Beneath each seat, there is a locked box containing a stun gun, pepper
<br>
spray, a gas mask, and daggers.  Each passenger also has a button.  If 50%
<br>
of the passengers press their buttons, then all weapons caches pop open.
<br>
Ground control can also open the boxes remotely.  Tampering with the boxes
<br>
or pressing the buttons alone causes alarms and flashing lights to go off
<br>
above the respective seats, for all the other passengers to see.  With
<br>
these constraints the boxes will always open with terrorists on board,
<br>
but they will never open at other times.  People used to think that
<br>
hijackers would fly the plane to Lebanon and ransom the passengers for
<br>
an equal number of Palestinian prisoners, so it was best for passengers
<br>
not to resist.  After last Tuesday's atrocities, passengers will think
<br>
they have nothing to lose and everything to gain by attacking highjackers.
<br>
Even so, when you subtract all the grannies, kids, wussies, etc. you might
<br>
only have 15% of the passengers physically and mentally capable of
<br>
challenging the highjackers.  5 tough, armed highjackers might be able to
<br>
hold off all the passengers, if the passengers are unarmed.  However, if
<br>
the passengers are armed then the highjackers don't stand a chance unless
<br>
they're a significant portion of the passengers, which is clearly an
<br>
impractical waste of precious kamikaze psychos.
<br>
<p>When considered in terms of game theory, it seems this system would
<br>
surely prevent terrorists from using passenger jets as cruise missiles.
<br>
If combined with highly effective explosives sniffing, terrorists wouldn't
<br>
even be able to crash a plane into the ground, because passengers could
<br>
always do talk-down landings if the pilots are killed.  Air terrorism
<br>
would become pointless, since the terrorists could get a higher body
<br>
counts by shooting into a crowded city street.  Our government would be
<br>
wise to consider game theory and creative solutions, instead of the
<br>
ineffective or counterproductive knee-jerk freedom-squashing &quot;solutions&quot;
<br>
it deploys in most matters.
<br>
<p><p>A handful of other quick thoughts...
<br>
<p>- For 2015-2020:  AI pilots (just be sure to keep them away from holy
<br>
books and other insanity-inducing memes!).
<br>
<p>- Call your representatives in support of H.R. 2896, which would allow
<br>
armed pilots.  Urge that it be extended to flight crew.
<br>
<p>- The terrorists attacked us because of our short-sighted and selfish
<br>
meddling with other nations.  I'm surprised airliner attacks didn't happen
<br>
earlier, and I'm surprised Latin America hasn't terrorized us yet.
<br>
However, if we continue with our policy of installing and supporting
<br>
brutal dictatorships (including Israel), we will probably see a nuclear
<br>
or biological attack within the decade.
<br>
<p>- If a tanker ship comes out of the Middle East carrying oil+fertilizer
<br>
instead of just oil, it could have the explosive power of a tactical nuke.
<br>
<p>- It is rather disturbing that the terrorists didn't wait until Bush
<br>
eventually returned to the White House.  They could have killed him
<br>
easily, while the nation was unwary.  Why didn't they do it?  What else
<br>
do they have up their sleeves?  A government-decapitating attack on
<br>
Washington these days would also be a severe psychological blow,
<br>
because it would show that we are vulnerable even with security at a
<br>
maximum.  If the terrorists are smart, they won't use the same method
<br>
twice.
<br>
<p>- I support surgical bombing of Afghanistan (not much to destroy) and
<br>
commando raids to seize/kill Bin Laden, his sidekicks, and his Taliban
<br>
supporters.
<br>
<p>- Note to you spooks who read my keyword-stuffed mail:  You don't have a
<br>
warrant, so piss off.  You Big Brother types have caused more misery than
<br>
the terrorists.  You would burn the Bill of Rights if given half a
<br>
chance.  You've already gutted the 4th and 5th amendments, and you're
<br>
working hard on the 1st and 2nd.  Now that you have an excuse to finish
<br>
the job,  I can only hope that freedom-loving Americans won't be stupid
<br>
or complacent enough to let you do it.  It's a slim hope.
