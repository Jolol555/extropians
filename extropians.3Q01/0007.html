<p>You are confusing extreme motivations (i.e. profound) with extreme
<br>
actions. Europeans do, in fact, get radically extreme maybe not over
<br>
silly things, but with silly solutions to profound problems: i.e.: a)
<br>
Crime is rising, so we need to disarm all the law abiding people, b)
<br>
Jews are prosperous business people and well educated and generally
<br>
smart, which contradicts our Odinist tradition of teutonic superiority,
<br>
so we need to kill them all to set things right, c) Serbs, Croats, and
<br>
Muslims are generally disagreeable people, so obviously they need to
<br>
kill each other off until there is no more disagreement, d) The US's
<br>
free market economy makes products more efficiently and cheaper than we
<br>
do, so obviously we need to shame and trick them into ratifying an
<br>
economy crippling 'Global Warming' treaty that we ourselves won't ratify
<br>
because we know it will REALLY cripple our socialist economies, e)
<br>
people tend to dislike oppressive, overbearing government, so obviously
<br>
we need to construct a nationwide surveillance system to keep an eye on
<br>
every citizen 24 hours a day.
