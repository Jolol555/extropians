<p>
just as a counter-anecdotal case, i graduated from a private school that at 
<br>
first cost me 4.5k a year(i only attended high school, and paid for it 
<br>
myself). last year, when i graduated, it was up to nearly 5k, and worth 
<br>
every penny. This was in cincinnati, cincinnati hills christian academy, 
<br>
google it, if you want to look at a really bad website.
<br>
<p>i was also able to win a scholarship that defrayed the cost of it. I can't 
<br>
believe that if there wasn't competition and more money in the market, 
<br>
private education couldn't get down to 2 or 3 thousand a year. some private 
<br>
colleges can do that, and they have a much more diversified teaching staff 
<br>
to support.

<em>&gt;$5K per year?  Maybe.  $2K per year?  No way.  Come September I'll be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;$8,500 for a year's worth of a 1st grade education (and that's one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cheapest schools I could find in the entire county).  Even at that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;school is constantly griping the entire year that they don't have enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pay the teachers a decent wage, and they're constantly asking for donations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and help with fundraisers all year long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;An unsubsidized $5K per year elementary school education is probably going
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to buy you a classroom where kids outnumber teachers by 40 to 1, and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;teacher who is earning barely enough to stay above the poverty line.
