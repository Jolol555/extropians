<p>
With all the controversy regarding stem cells and cloning lately I was 
<br>
fascinated to hear that Rael himself, a former Frenchman(now Canadian), 
<br>
would be a guest on the show.  As I think we all know, he leads a religious 
<br>
group which some call a cult.  They have made the headlines by saying they 
<br>
will be the first to clone a human being, and to do so have established one 
<br>
secret lab in the U.S. and one outside of it.
<br>
<p>I found Rael to be quite charming with his very strong french accent and 
<br>
general affability.  These things must surely help when building up one's 
<br>
own private church based on adoring space aliens...  He had a decent but 
<br>
definitely not great grasp of science and technology, but Rael had more then 
<br>
enough enthusiasm for it! lol
<br>
<p>He said he loves the American system of gov't and is working within the 
<br>
system to legally clone here.  He has assembled a crack team of lawyers to 
<br>
take on the FDA.  Rael has disclosed to the U.S. gov't where his lab is here 
<br>
but he does not want the knowledge public.
<br>
<p>Rael claims the alien &quot;Elohim&quot; guided human evolution to create us in their 
<br>
own image.  What he is planning was laid out for him by them.  After a 
<br>
conventional cloning(birth as a baby from a surrogate) he wants to work on 
<br>
accelerating the growth of a clone so in a relatively short time an adult 
<br>
clone could  be ready.  Finally, he wants to see perfected uploading into 
<br>
adult clone bodies.
<br>
<p>Rael claims this is how the aliens he is in contact have become immortal.  
<br>
None of the callers tangled with him on the nature of identity and the 
<br>
&quot;self-circuit.&quot; lol  This guy even claims the aliens have a computer which 
<br>
monitors all our actions and makes clones of our finest people who are 
<br>
deserving(like Buddha).
<br>
<p>When we are evolved enough they will make themselves public.  Part of his 
<br>
mission is to build a pleasant &quot;embassy&quot; for the alien visit.  They were 
<br>
kind enough to give him a detailed description of what it should look like.  
<br>
They had plenty of time for this while he spent two years on their planet...
<br>
<p>Rael positively glows on matters of technological progress in a somewhat 
<br>
naive way.  He even discussed how biotech, nanotech and artificial 
<br>
intelligence will converge into a sort of singularity!  It made me wonder if 
<br>
he is a lurker here...
<br>
<p>What worried me was that people would make some sort of comparison between 
<br>
the Raellians and the extropians.  There are seeming similarities for those 
<br>
who are not aware of the gaping differences.  I would almost call the 
<br>
Raellians a &quot;counterfeit&quot; religious version of transhumanism.  If any of you 
<br>
had listened to him for four hours you would have picked up on this.  You 
<br>
can hear the show on the Art Bell archive.
<br>
<p>Just go to...
<br>
<p>artbell.com    and look for the show archives
<br>
<p>This Rael has over 55,000 members who are expected to give 3% of their 
<br>
yearly income to him!  The power of an organization in religious trappings 
<br>
must be incredibly strong.  I wish the Extropy Institute had half the 
<br>
members and money this man does...
<br>
<p>What bothers me is he could create a public backlash against cloning and 
<br>
biotech in general.  The average american does not seem to like this man or 
<br>
his organization.  You should have heard the angry people calling in to heap 
<br>
derision on him for having a supposedly cult-like organization doing cloning 
<br>
work!!  This could really turn ugly...
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
