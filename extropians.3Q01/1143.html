<em>&gt; I've looked up the Canadian Charter. It does, indeed, commence:

</em><br>

<em>&gt; God and the rule of Law&quot;.
</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>it refers to individuals being endowed by 'their creator' with certain
<br>
inalienable rights. A majority of those in the continental congress were
<br>
of Unitarian, Universalist, or Quaker extraction, and recognised the
<br>
religious diversity throughout the states, and our history of being a
<br>
haven for religous groups that european countries (particularly Britain)
<br>
trod down on. Heck, the state of Rhode Island was founded by a splinter
<br>
group from a splinter group. As a result, they likely wished to make it
<br>
a bit easier for all groups to understand and appreciate that it is our
<br>
natural rights that is truly important, not the name of the entity which
<br>
endowed us with them.
<br>
<p>I expect that the British Parliament, being dominated by the Anglican
<br>
Church, felt a bit less compunction against a more overt phrasing.
