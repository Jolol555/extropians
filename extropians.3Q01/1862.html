<p><em>&gt; Usually undernourished people's immune systems shut down and they die of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pneumonia, tuberculosis, or some other infectious disease. Tuberculosis is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becoming quite a problem in Mexico lately and in certain poor areas of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S.A.
</em><br>
<p>Have any idea how many people each year die from tuberculosis?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once they're past the toddler stage, children tend to be fairly robust and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can survive on a very poor diet, although they may suffer from various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning disabilities and other mental and emotional disorders. I know from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal observation that some children have only the free breakfast and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lunch provided by schools, occasionally supplemented by what they're able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steal from stores or scrounge from dumpsters.
</em><br>
<p>Well, &quot;malnutrition&quot; doesn't have the rhetorical advantages
<br>
of &quot;starvation!&quot;.  But evidently it's a lot closer to the mark.
<br>
<p>(You've been providing some pretty good info... sorry for 
<br>
pressing my luck:)
<br>
<p>Have any idea of how many children in the U.S. are severely
<br>
malnourished.  Yes, I'm sure that government programs help
<br>
out a lot in the sense that many children get their nutrition
<br>
from programs.  But we must remember that many of these children
<br>
would be fed by their parents, if their parents didn't freely
<br>
have a government program to take advantage of.
<br>
<p>We must also not overlook the fact that the U.S. government was
<br>
paying about 20 billion dollars a year to young women to have
<br>
children out of wedlock in the sixties, seventies, and eighties.
