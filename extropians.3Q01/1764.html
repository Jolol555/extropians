<em>&gt;An example is housing.  Given the relative level of sophistication of

</em><br>
<em>&gt;current model/style of moble home:  simply consider the possiblities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the realm of very cheap modular housing.
</em><br>
<p>At whos expence?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But prevailing laws prevent that.  Look as an example at the many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;laws against the placement and moving of mobile homes.  I doubt you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are even aware of the scope and magnitude of these laws. And never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mind zoning and housing associations...
</em><br>
<p>I agree about the zoning laws, their clearly anti-freedom based. Home
<br>
ownership assoc. on the other hand are a perfectly acceptable mechanism to
<br>
&quot;block off&quot; a large section of area to keep it all under one set of
<br>
standards. As long as their is no force being delivered from the government,
<br>
people are free to contract and make arrangments all they want. If you dont
<br>
like the rules of a particular group, dont deal with them and find a group
<br>
you like.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;These laws act to prop up the values of current ocuppied and future
</em><br>
<em>&gt;homes--at the expense of those without a home.  So now the 60% or so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of people own homes in the USA can prop-up their own wealth... at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expense of others. Many of these &quot;others&quot; can be seen sleeping under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bridges.
</em><br>
<p>I would be willing to bet a VERY large percentage of people sleeping under
<br>
bridges in the US are their from the choices they made. (99% maybe?,
<br>
certainly over 95%). They were not put there by &quot;Tha manT&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The recent  removal of barriers to immigration into the USA help to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prop up property values and therefore preserve the wealth of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that are land owners, and conversely, help to empty the pockets of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those that are not landowners.  Those green pieces of paper fly out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the pockets of the landless and into the pockets of the landed. With
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more people coming into the country, more green pieces of paper are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;flying.
</em><br>
<p>Man, lock out the aliens, and were depriving them of the chance for a good
<br>
life, let them in and were exploiting them... Plus, this sounds kinda
<br>
conspritorial as if smoking man had the plans for this locked up out in area
<br>
51.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Medical care is another of the pillars of a &quot;comfortable life&quot;.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;note that the physician lobby acted a few years ago to limit the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supply of doctors.  The accompanying propaganda was laughable...
</em><br>
<p>I to agree against the government &quot;limiting&quot; or licensing doctors, nurses,
<br>
midwives, etc.... Theres tons of other ways to accomplish this without their
<br>
intrusion (which I dont feel the need to go into here).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Ehrenbach is completely right (in her recent book _Nickled and Dimed_
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which detailed her sojourns as a low paid worker) when she said that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we all exploit these low paid workers.  In fact, our own wealth and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;status depends upon their presence. If they were not poor and working
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to obtain the resources we possess, much of our wealth would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worthless.... just pieces of green paper.
</em><br>
<p>Why am I &quot;exploiting&quot; the guy at the drive through a mcdonalds? If hes a
<br>
teen working there, Id say its a great job for him. If its a 30 year old man
<br>
with a family working there, Id say hes made some REAL bad choices in his
<br>
life. I guess you could argue that our society exploits stupidity or
<br>
lazyness...
