Researchers are working to develop a robot with a personality and which can
<br>
behave according to social conventions.

<br>
<p>They see this as the next step in the evolution of robotics.
<br>
<p>&quot;Robotics is getting to the point that a lot of hard problems people have been
<br>
dealing with for the past 10 or 20 years are starting to be solved,&quot; Allison
<br>
Leigh Bruce, from the Robotics Institute, told BBC News Online.
<br>
<p>&quot;A lot of interest has been shown in having service robots, or museum tour
<br>
guide robots - robots that are going to be inherently living in spaces that
<br>
people inhabit and interacting with a lot of people who don't know a lot about
<br>
robots.&quot;
<br>
<p>Friendly face
<br>
Researchers believe the answer lies in making robots behave more like people,
<br>
starting off by giving them a friendly human face.
<br>
<p>&quot;We are doing a lot with facial expression, so when the robot tells you
<br>
something, you don't just get the robot's voice, as synthesised speech is very
<br>
flat and doesn't have any of the emotional cues people put into their own
<br>
speech.&quot;
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
