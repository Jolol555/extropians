TERRORISTS TARGET AMERICA:
<br>
Perspectives from the Foreign Press
<br>
from <a href="http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/News/NewsPress091401.htm">http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/News/NewsPress091401.htm</a>
<br>
<p>The quality of much foreign commentary, not for the first time, exceeds that
<br>
of our &quot;mainstream&quot; press.
<br>
<p>Simon Jenkins warned in The Times of London (September 12):
<br>
<p>Those critical of NATO bombing might offer America more sympathy if NATO had
<br>
offered sympathy for the hundreds of civilian deaths from its missiles and
<br>
cluster bombs far from home. US generals openly demanded the bombing of
<br>
civilian targets in Belgrade and Baghdad, to &quot;break the will&quot; of local
<br>
people. Is that not what the perpetrators of yesterday's outrage might say?
<br>
Here we tread warily. Sponsoring the state of Israel led America into a
<br>
prolonged and senseless hostility to the cause of the dispossessed
<br>
Palestinians. The financing of anti-Soviet warlords in Afghanistan in the
<br>
1980s armed and galvanised terrorist groups, including Osama bin Laden and
<br>
others behind the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre . . . The message
<br>
of yesterday's incident is that, for all its horror, it does not and must
<br>
not be allowed to matter. It is a human disaster, an outrage, an atrocity,
<br>
an unleashing of the madness of which the world will never be rid. But it is
<br>
not politically significant. It does not tilt the balance of world power one
<br>
inch. It is not an act of war. America's leadership of the West is not
<br>
diminished by it. The cause of democracy is not damaged, unless we choose to
<br>
let it be damaged.
<br>
<p>The London Guardian opined (9/13):
<br>
<p>Pounding Afghanistan into dust with cruise missiles and long-range bombers
<br>
might make Americans feel better about the Manhattan horror.  But such
<br>
cathartic vengeance would do nothing to curb the menace of transnational
<br>
terrorism....  Truly, there are no limits, if the United States were to take
<br>
this path, turning from world cop to global hitman.  But nor is there much
<br>
rationality in such an approach.... No, these are the dangerous counsels of
<br>
anger and thwarted power, urging Mr. Bush to lash out wildly.  They should
<br>
be ignored.  The war on terrorism will not be won that way.  Military
<br>
action, especially a NATO assault, must be the option of the last resort.
<br>
<p>Writing in the same paper on September 14, Jonathan Friedland said that
<br>
<p>Tuesday's killers have struck a blow against globalisation more potent even
<br>
than their toppling of the twin totems of the World Trade Centre. Faith in
<br>
easy, safe, jet travel--so crucial to shrinking our world--has vanished . .
<br>
. Whatever happens next, that act has won one success already. It has made
<br>
Americans, and everyone else, fear their own world.
<br>
<p>The London Independent (9/13):
<br>
<p>While we in Britain clearly &quot;stand shoulder to shoulder with our American
<br>
friends&quot; in their shock and their dread and in their determination to do
<br>
what they can to avert further atrocities, we should see the nature of
<br>
President Bush's response before identifying ourselves too closely with what
<br>
might all too easily become a counterproductive thirst for revenge. . . . No
<br>
one doubts the need for tighter security or for military action against
<br>
identifiable threats, but Tuesday's barbarities exposed the extent to which
<br>
U.S. policy towards the threat from 'rogue states' was misdirected.  The
<br>
obsession with a technological fix, the 'son of Star Wars' missile shield,
<br>
has distracted attention from dealing with the religious and ideological
<br>
basis of low-tech terrorism.
<br>
<p>The Financial Times editorialized (9/12):
<br>
<p>Mr. Bush should also review his policy towards the Middle East. . . . The
<br>
administration's hands-off approach and its tolerance of . . . Sharon's
<br>
hardline has encouraged extremists across the region looking for any excuse
<br>
to demonize Americans.
<br>
<p>In Athens, Eleftherotypia said (9/12):
<br>
<p>The United States leadership must realize that the best reaction is that of
<br>
democratization of the world order, respect for international law,
<br>
abandonment of arbitrary behavior or the law of the sheriff.  The answer to
<br>
terrorism is always more democracy for all the peoples of the planet.
<br>
<p>In Toronto, Rick Salutin opined in The Globe and Mail (9/14):
<br>
<p>Once it's been shown to be doable, it becomes redoable, with relative ease.
<br>
Except for one item, harder to duplicate and on which it all depends: the
<br>
willingness of those involved to kill themselves. This is what marks these
<br>
attacks as 21st century rather than 20th . . . Bizarrely, the rise of
<br>
fundamentalist religion as a political factor in many parts of the world
<br>
owes something to American policy. The U.S. chose to nurture Islamic
<br>
fundamentalism in Afghanistan in the 1980s, to undermine Soviet control
<br>
there; in the course of which it worked with, armed and trained--Osama bin
<br>
Laden! In a similar way, Israel chose to encourage fundamentalism among
<br>
Palestinians to undermine secular left-wing forces.
<br>
<p>In Iceland Morgunbladid commented (9/12):
<br>
<p>It is possible that the horrible events yesterday will lead to louder
<br>
demands in the United States for the Bush administration to revaluate their
<br>
Middle East policies.
<br>
<p>In Portugal, the influential daily Público opined (9/12):
<br>
<p>This proves that the United States, if it wants to survive in this new world
<br>
of wars waged on the battlefields of the purest terror, not only must better
<br>
understand the real weight of the conflicts with which it is dealing (the
<br>
Middle East in particular), but also agree to cooperation with the other
<br>
democracies in order to restore a minimum of human dignity in a world where
<br>
barbarism threatens to rule.
<br>
<p>Jean-Marie Colombani commented in a front-page editorial in Le Monde (9/13):
<br>
<p>The reality is that we have a world without counterweight, physically
<br>
unbalanced and therefore dangerous, because it lacks the balance of
<br>
multipolarity. . . . The future, which is etched in blood, already points to
<br>
two clear consequences that have to do with alliances: it is the end of a
<br>
strategy based solely against Russia.  Russia will become Washington's main
<br>
ally.  It may also be the end of an alliance, which the United States
<br>
established with the Islamic Sunni regimes, such as those of Saudi Arabia
<br>
and Pakistan.
<br>
<p>Serge July held in left-of-center Liberation (9/13):
<br>
<p>The United States is dying to counterattack.  But here again it will be
<br>
limited by the dangerous liaisons it has woven with Islamic movements since
<br>
the war in Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>Michel Schifres opined in right-of-center Le Figaro (9/13):
<br>
<p>Changes will result from this attack: first, the United States will need to
<br>
reorient its secret service surveillance to political issues as opposed to
<br>
economic issues.  And it will have to stop &quot;playing&quot; with Islamic extremists
<br>
and stop closing its eyes to the regimes that harbor terrorists.
<br>
<p>Werner Burchardt commented on German national radio station Deutschlandfunk
<br>
(9/12):
<br>
<p>The &quot;massive retaliatory strike&quot; which Washington announced does not bode
<br>
well.  We Germans, who owe so much to the Americans after the end of WW II,
<br>
should keep a critical distance to the United States and prevent it from
<br>
making mistakes.
<br>
<p>Maksim Yusin remarked in Moscow's Izvestiya (9/13):
<br>
<p>Differences among civilizations are not in what politicians say.  They are
<br>
in how ordinary people act in a crisis. The moment of truth has put
<br>
everything in its place.  No matter how much some of our politicians speak
<br>
of a &quot;strategic partnership&quot; and near-friendship with Saddam, Qaddafi and
<br>
Iran's ayatollahs, the world knows now with whom we really are--as people
<br>
bring flowers to U.S. diplomatic missions in Moscow and other Russian
<br>
cities.
<br>
<p>Also in Russia, Vremya commented:
<br>
<p>The Americans should review their military doctrine.  Now is the time for
<br>
them to think about what makes anti-American sentiment so strong in the
<br>
world, why the Great Satan is hated so much, and if the late Senator William
<br>
Fulbright was right about the &quot;arrogance of power.&quot;
<br>
<p>Aleksandr Frolov stated in Sovetskaya Rossiya (9/13):
<br>
<p>Early commentaries clearly overdid it, speaking about an &quot;unprecedented&quot;
<br>
event.  All commentators suddenly &quot;forgot&quot; about precedents such as Dresden,
<br>
Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Vietnam, and Yugoslavia, all set by America.  People
<br>
remember that.  Even so, if the attack is retribution, it is unjust.  It has
<br>
missed those who are really responsible for the war that has been going on
<br>
in the world for the past 50 years.
<br>
<p>Jerusalem Post editorialized (9/13):
<br>
<p>The free world must recognize that it is in a war of self-defense whose goal
<br>
is victory.  The concept of a war against terrorism is meaningless without
<br>
the goal of removing terrorist regimes. . . . A war against terrorism that
<br>
avoids the issue of regime change in countries such as Iraq, Iran, and
<br>
Afghanistan cannot be won, because it has not even really been joined.
<br>
<p>Israeli daily Ha'aretz commented (9/12):
<br>
<p>The price America has paid and pays for its is done in the name of all
<br>
freedom-loving countries, including Israel, which are not ready to bow their
<br>
heads before extremists who enlist God to justify their murderous
<br>
activities.
<br>
<p>Yediot Aharonot wrote (9/12):
<br>
<p>For almost one year, Israel has withstood a cruel terrorist offensive on its
<br>
own.  Israel's sometimes excessive responses have been greatly criticized in
<br>
the world and have been met by a good deal of misunderstanding and a lack of
<br>
empathy.  The New York and Washington scenes will now open the eyes of many
<br>
people. . . . The U.S., Britain, France and other Western countries will now
<br>
do their moral stocktaking as to what they did or did not do to eliminate
<br>
terrorism and to contain it....  We, the Israelis, will tell them
<br>
sorrowfully and with a feeling of a shared fate: &quot;We told you so.&quot;
<br>
<p>Jerusalem Post editorialized (9/12):
<br>
<p>We are sickened, once again, by scenes of Palestinians dancing in the
<br>
streets, this time celebrating the deaths of Americans.  We have trouble
<br>
fathoming the hatred directed at us, so we can only imagine the bafflement
<br>
and pain of Americans attempting to contemplate the baseless hatred directed
<br>
at them. . . . Until now, the democracies have fiddled with and indulged the
<br>
states where terrorism has been cultivated and grown.
<br>
<p>In Tel Aviv Hatzofe wrote (9/12):
<br>
<p>The determination that has not been seen thus far in the war against
<br>
fundamentalist terrorism will now be activated.  Simply because there is no
<br>
other choice.  What happened yesterday is unlike any terrorism we have been
<br>
through.
<br>
<p>Mohammad Subeihi wrote in Al-Arab Al-Yawm (9/12):
<br>
<p>We also realize that the American people, now fallen to grief, will find the
<br>
chance to review its administrations' policy that has made the U.S. a target
<br>
for terrorist organizations that are increasingly growing inside and outside
<br>
America.
<br>
<p>Israel's Arabic language daily Al-Ittihad held (9/12):
<br>
<p>In order to fight terrorism, one needs to look for its background . . . and
<br>
its causes.  The U.S. administration should stand in front of the mirror and
<br>
ask itself questions about organized state terrorism it has carried out
<br>
against Cuba, Libya, the Iraqi people and many others.  [It should consider]
<br>
its crimes in support of Israeli terrorism against Palestinians.
<br>
<p>On the West Bank the semi-official Al-Hayat Al-Jadida opined (9/13):
<br>
<p>It is absolutely not in the Palestinian interest to express any complacency
<br>
[regarding the attacks on America]. Those ignorant few, who did that, do not
<br>
represent our public opinion. In fact such an ignorant behavior might have
<br>
happened in other parts of the world, but, unfortunately, the cameras did
<br>
not reach them and the media did not really care about those. . . . We are
<br>
victims of terrorism, and victims should stick together. We and the
<br>
Americans share the same grief.
<br>
<p>Pro-Palestinian Authority Al-Ayyam opined (9/13):
<br>
<p>The Palestinians and the Americans find themselves in the same boat. The
<br>
American officials in the White House have been showing understanding to the
<br>
attacks perpetrated by the Jewish State. . . . It is not clear that, having
<br>
the Americans suffer from what the Palestinians have been through for the
<br>
last year, such an understanding can continue.
<br>
<p>Al-Quds editorialized (9/13):
<br>
<p>The irony of the situation is that Israel is exploiting what is going on in
<br>
the United States to claim that it stands behind America in its fight
<br>
against terrorism. This is a twisted logic, considering that Israel is an
<br>
occupying country that is oppressing the Palestinian people.  It is
<br>
important that the United States realize the big difference between the
<br>
American case and the Israeli case.
<br>
<p>Jeddah-based Saudi daily Al-Bilad remarked (9/13):
<br>
<p>Until now, the key beneficiary of yesterday's horrible catastrophe against
<br>
the American people is Israel.
<br>
<p>The independent South China Morning Post of Hong Kong noted (9/13):
<br>
<p>It would be opportune for the U.S. to take a realistic look at its
<br>
relationship with the rest of the world. . . . If the U.S. is to continue to
<br>
exercise its global role, it is important that besides handing out
<br>
retribution to those involved in the terrorist attacks it also pays
<br>
attention to the causes for this resentment and to try and understand it.
<br>
The security of the US cannot rest solely on the power of its armed forces.
<br>
It also needs a new diplomacy to reach out to those who feel alienated from
<br>
a US-led global order.
<br>
<p>Chinese-language Hong Kong daily Wen Wei Po wrote in its editorial (9/13):
<br>
<p>Terrorist activities are basically related to U.S. hegemonism in its dealing
<br>
with world affairs.
<br>
<p>In South Korea pro-government Hankyoreh Shinmun editorialized (9/13):
<br>
<p>Given that the U.S. has been under fire from the international community for
<br>
its power-based, arrogant attitude, the Americans need to take this incident
<br>
as an opportunity to reflect on whether they have encouraged this desperate
<br>
and hostile terrorism.
<br>
<p>In India the centrist daily Pioneer asserted (9/13):
<br>
<p>Osama bin Laden's Frankensteinian entity was largely created by none else
<br>
than the CIA to counter the Soviet occupation troops in Afghanistan....  the
<br>
U.S. spent more than $600 million in this operation, which has now come back
<br>
to haunt America with its worst nightmare. This is the link that U.S. policy
<br>
makers need to understand before they embark on any retribution in the form
<br>
of retaliatory attacks.  Pakistan and Taliban are the creation of U.S.
<br>
foreign and military policies that have now backfired, creating in the
<br>
process enemies of humanity like.
<br>
<p>An op-ed by Irshad Ahmed Haqqani in the leading Pakistani daily Jang
<br>
stressed (9/13):
<br>
<p>Not a single media commentary from the United States has hinted at a
<br>
critical appreciation of the country's foreign policy.  Only one statement
<br>
is being repeated, that the terrorism against America will be responded to
<br>
and the terrorists will be crushed.
<br>
<p>Michele Ouimet judged in the lead editorial in Montreal's La Presse (9/13):
<br>
<p>Of course Americans' anger is legitimate and a lot of innocent people were
<br>
killed. . . . But American sanctions also kill.  More slowly, more subtly,
<br>
unspectacularly . . . and they especially hit the innocent civilians.  We
<br>
wrote yesterday about the impact of economic sanctions on Iraq.   They
<br>
succeeded in agitating new hatred against America but also killed--at least
<br>
3,000 children a month, according to UNICEF.   Innocent populations have
<br>
nothing to do with extremist terrorist groups . . . and they shouldn't have
<br>
to pay the price of the retaliation.
<br>
<p>Columnist Susan Riley wrote in the Ottawa Citizen (9/12):
<br>
<p>As for Canada:  Our best protection may be distancing ourselves a little
<br>
more explicitly from U.S. foreign policy . . . Faced with the random
<br>
brutality unleashed on ordinary Americans yesterday, it is hard not to
<br>
think:  Thank God, I live in Canada. We are safe because of our relative
<br>
harmlessness, more than our virtue.
<br>
<p>In Brazil O Estado de Sao Paulo Paris correspondent Giles Lapouge asked
<br>
(9/13):
<br>
<p>Wasn't Osama bin Laden cynically trained by the CIA? Wasn't he chosen by the
<br>
United States as an essential element in the fight against the Soviets?
<br>
Wasn't it the United States that produced this devil? It took lots of time
<br>
for the United States to realize what everyone knew from the very beginning.
<br>
<p>Folha de S. Paulo columnist Marcelo Coelho judged (9/13):
<br>
<p>A brutal, simultaneous, unexpected, cowardly attack will serve for that the
<br>
immense U.S. military power to be used without the supposed good manners of
<br>
a civilized nation. The problem is that so far the bombings and terror
<br>
actions carried out by the U.S. had remote adversaries, and distant
<br>
justifications. How many thousand children died in the bombings against
<br>
Iraq? How many civilian targets were hit due to 'technical failure' in
<br>
Serbia? How can one condemn terrorism after having used napalm in Vietnam?
<br>
Not to mention Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Of course I prefer Bush to bin Laden,
<br>
as well as the Republicans to Taliban. But we should not think whether it is
<br>
better to bomb Manhattan or destroy Kabul. . . . I deplore the American
<br>
victims, not that the Pentagon was hit.
<br>
<p>An editorial in Mexico City's La Jornada states (9/13):
<br>
<p>It is important to remember that regardless of the reasons for the criminal
<br>
attacks in New York and in Washington, it is a matter of U.S. domestic and
<br>
foreign policy, and that the Mexican people have nothing to do with them.
<br>
<p>Monterrey's leading El Norte ran commentary by a former Mexican diplomat
<br>
(9/13):
<br>
<p>There will also be a witch-hunt. . . .  And if you think that being a
<br>
Mexican makes you safe, let me tell you that in some U.S. intelligence
<br>
circles, Mexico is not only considered a dangerous source of drug
<br>
trafficking but also of terrorism, with special concentration on the Mexican
<br>
states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Guerrero, which may harbor terrorist cells
<br>
capable of bombing banks, ambushing and sabotaging anything that has a U.S.
<br>
profile.
