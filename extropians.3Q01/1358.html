<p>
I hope I got the above subject line protocol right.
<br>
<p>As I alluded to in a post last week, I am currently involved in a public 
<br>
debate with Australian-Canadian bioethicist and prominent neo-Luddite, 
<br>
Margaret Somerville, whose book ,_The Ethical Canary_ attacks all forms of 
<br>
cloning and embryo experimentation (among other things).
<br>
<p>I responded to her book with an article of well over 5000 words in 
<br>
_Quadrant_ (a well-known, controversial, supposedly &quot;right-wing&quot; 
<br>
intellectual journal here in Australia). Last week, Somerville retaliated 
<br>
with a defence of her position almost as long, also in _Quadrant_.
<br>
<p>None of this material is yet available on the net, though _Quadrant_ is 
<br>
moving to establish a site which will contain an archive of material that it 
<br>
has published in the past few years.
<br>
<p>I feel I need to respond to Somerville, so I'll submit something to 
<br>
_Quadrant_ and see whether they take it, or whether (as would be 
<br>
understandable) they've had enough of the issue for now. I've been putting 
<br>
my left-over energies from the day job into this during the past few days 
<br>
and I look like coming up with something of about 3000 to 4000 words.
<br>
<p>I'm giving all this detail of the history and the size of the various pieces 
<br>
to put you all off. :-)  You might not be able to make much sense of what I 
<br>
write without having read this earlier material, or some of it. That caveat 
<br>
stated, I'm finding how tricky it is answering someone who uses motherhood 
<br>
statements such as &quot;we should have a deep respect for life in all its forms 
<br>
and manifestations&quot; as a starting point for philosophical argument. I think 
<br>
this is pretty much irrationalist nonsense, at least in the way that I 
<br>
understand Somerville intends it (eg, she seems to think we must show 
<br>
reverence to embryos, so we can't ethically do stem cell research). However, 
<br>
attempting to debunk it runs the risk of alienating some readers, for whom 
<br>
it may sound very sonerous and attractive.
<br>
<p>Accordingly, despite the above warnings about context etc, I'd welcome any 
<br>
comments on the piece when I've completed an initial draft. It'll be too 
<br>
long to post out to the list as an attachment and clutter you all up, and 
<br>
you don't *all* want to read it anyway. Besides, I don't like spraying 
<br>
drafts around in a more-or-less public forum. However, if anyone in addition 
<br>
to Damien (whom I'll try it out on routinely) wants to contact me either to 
<br>
have a quick look at the thing and comment (ask only if you could turn it 
<br>
around in a day or two) or just discuss how these situations are best 
<br>
handled, I'd be appreciative. In fact, I'd also be interested to kick around 
<br>
the more general issue on the list.
<br>
<p>Ascend!
