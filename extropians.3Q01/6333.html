<p>
I think I may have proposed this idea on the list 5 or 10 years ago,
<br>
but it bears repeating.
<br>
<p>Unarmed passengers cannot reliably stop armed hijackers.  Sky marshals
<br>
are pretty good but once hijackers know that there's going to be one on
<br>
board, they can take steps to identify and stop the marshal.
<br>
<p>Instead:  have buttons.  One in the cockpit.  One that flight attendants
<br>
know about.  One in the pocket of the sky marshal.  When the button
<br>
is pushed, guns drop from overhead, like oxygen masks.  The guns only
<br>
drop at seats occupied by adults.  They fire a charge that cannot
<br>
penetrate the aircraft's skin.  The weapon may or may not be lethal;
<br>
the implications are different.
<br>
<p>Since there are multiple buttons, and multiple people who can push one,
<br>
it is very difficult for the hijackers to prevent a button-push.  Once a
<br>
button has been pushed, the hijackers are now vastly outnumbered and
<br>
outgunned.
<br>
<p>It would seem like it would take at most one aborted hijacking, even if
<br>
there were passenger casualties, before would-be hijackers found
<br>
something better to do.
