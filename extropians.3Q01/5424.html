</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe then you can clarify the exact point in time and space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;that &quot;Stock options&quot; and the days that are above the minimum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;were fought for and achieved? While you at it, find out where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;they were forced to pay for my relocation to a new city for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;job.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;What about my company bonus? When did the evil business owners
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;collapse to the demands for this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Sure, glad to help....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; The shift in the time-space continuum you refereed to occurred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; in Chicago on May 4th 1886.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Without this occurring we probably wouldn't even have minimum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;wage yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I figured you would dodge this. I didn't ask about when minimum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;wage started, I'm asking why everyone isn't getting paid minimum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;wage?!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't dodge the question I answered it exactly. You asked for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the exact point in space and time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On May 4th 1886 at Haymarket Square in Chicago was the point in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space/time when relationships between employers and employees was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permanently altered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The sociological singularity that occured on that day like any good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity began literally with a &quot;BANG&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The results have cascaded down through space-time since then and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have resulted in the benefits you received.
</em><br>
<p><p>My point here is why doesnt everyone get the legislated minimum? I make more
<br>
then minimum wage and theres a reason. Supply and demand dictate this stuff,
<br>
not government OR buisnesses OR unions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What proof? If a company pays you 50K instead of 25K, they cant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hire that 2nd person. Cant imagine anyone not getting that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No the proof that without &quot;Union Interference&quot; we would all have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been better off.
</em><br>
<p>This boils down to.. did the unions distort the market. If they did, they
<br>
created inefficiencies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;You missed my point again. They don't have the funds to hire you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;for 3, only 2.50. If this logic worked, we could just raise the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;minimum wage to a million dollars an hour and well all be rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;right? Just pay them all more is the mantra here right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You missed my point, If you were worth $6.00 dollars, they'd have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no problem hiring you for $3.00.
</em><br>
<p>Worth $6 to whom? The company? Why are you worth more then everyone else? My
<br>
supposition was the normal wage for a particular job was $3. Why cant I come
<br>
in and offer to do the same job as the union guys at a lower price?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I personally have 1 uncle that works at Ford on the assembly line.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;He makes 45K for reasonable unskilled work due to union pressure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The companies may be making a profit, but I wonder how much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;they could have grown otherwise. How many more jobs would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;been created. How many more people hired? Maybe they might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;buying Fords in Japan if that had been the case?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ford has been moving it's production to Mexico. Much of the high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost of assembly line work is due to the sheer drudgery of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Have you checked management compensation at Ford?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Like someone else said in their post, the unions can bitch and whine all
<br>
they want. End the end, Mexico will get the jobs and those union saps will
<br>
be out of work. Thell learn they cant control market forces long without
<br>
paying the piper.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Yeah, like I said, the teamsters were simply angels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I never said that you did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hopefully you will never end up in a situation where you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literally fighting to feed your kids, you'd be amazed at what your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So in a situation where a job is needed to prevent my kids from going
<br>
hungry, dont you think that attacking companies may not be the best route to
<br>
accomplish this? They MAKE the jobs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Microsoft is NOT a coercive monopoly. Only the government can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;create an organization and use the power of force to keep it on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;top (like post office, utilities, etc..). Microsoft is on top
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;because they provide a product that people WANT to buy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The government and millions of critics disagree.
</em><br>
<p>I dont want to get into anti-trust law here, but I will say that it is so
<br>
subjective, there is no way a company can possible know in advance of a
<br>
trial, if what their doing will result in getting attacked for &quot;monopolistic
<br>
practices&quot;. I know its popular to attack the successful guy, your right, the
<br>
government and millions of Americans cant stand the rich and will attack
<br>
then whenever they can for any reason they can drum up. Class warfare at its
<br>
best, but ultimately Microsoft doesnt control the OS market as long as
<br>
theres alternatives. They just have a huge market share and thats the goal
<br>
of ALL companies I know of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;But those poor ragged starving masses cant distort the market it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;seems, even with the power of a union. Its so easy to empathize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;with those sweet innocent non-violent unions when the antagonist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is some burly evil corporation that kills, maims, and steal little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;children's candy for the fun of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you can't abstain from the rhetoric, this is just a waste of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brian
</em><br>
<p>My point here is to do the same thing youve been doing. You said we owe
<br>
everything we have to the unions and thats simply not true. Youve said
<br>
nothing positive at all about the corporations and it appears that the
<br>
unions can do no wrong. I simply expanded on this approach to show the
<br>
lameness of using it in a reasonable debate. Its a lot easier to imagine a
<br>
world with no unions then it is to picture one without companies.
<br>
<p>I will say one thing nice about the unions. If your in one, you can force a
<br>
company to pay you over market value for your labor. For the consumers or
<br>
the people needing jobs, sorry though, your out of luck.
<br>
