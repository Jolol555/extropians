<em>&gt;&gt; 250 billion is the lowball figure just to rewire the U.S. with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fiber.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I question that.  First though, fiber doesn't have anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessarily to do with wireless.  Most phone centers now are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;connected by fiber afaik.  It is the &quot;last mile&quot; problem that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remains.  For that local wireless might be one viable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alternative.  Others could include an Iridium style program
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(expanded and better run), high altitude low power targets to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bounce signals off of (large light planes, blimps, something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;else).  In none of these cases does it look like any quarter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a trillion dollars is needed.  
</em><br>
<p>What &quot;last mile&quot; problem? We're allowed only to do extremely local
<br>
telephone service, and the system we've installed and run is
<br>
optimal for that.
<br>
<p>When we're allowed to do something else, we'll build something
<br>
else.
<br>
<p>Since we're also the company that introduced cellphones in the U.S.
<br>
we know a thing or two about wireless, and the numbers aren't
<br>
there. We keep looking at it every day though.
<br>
<p>We looked long and hard at Iridium, and at the others.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Lets see there are about 6.2 billion people in the world, if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; could do this for $1000 a port (we can't get even close to that)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you're talking 6.2 trillion dollars. The real figure to build 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; such  a system is probably considerably more.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;What &quot;port&quot;?  Maybe we are speaking apples and oranges?  I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt;talking about the cost to deliver reasonably high-speed wireless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;connectivity world-wide.  I am not including the cost of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terminals used to take advantage of that capacity. 
</em><br>
<p>Any independent connection is refered to as a port, a cell tower
<br>
for example can only handle so many calls at once, so many &quot;ports&quot;.
<br>
<p>We look at high speed wireless everyday, and talk to our customers
<br>
everyday, we have the curves plotted for every available technology
<br>
compared to what people have said they're willing to pay, and the
<br>
curves are nowhere near close.
<br>
<p><p>We'll keep watching....
