Hello <a href="mailto:deepbluehalo@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Greg%20Johnson%20on%20dropping%20the%20alliance%20with%20Israel&In-Reply-To=&lt;14e.115e577.28d6de6e@aol.com&gt;">deepbluehalo@earthlink.net</a> (Brian Phillips),
<br>
<p>In reference to your comment:
<br>
<p>I'm a Jew. I don't believe in much, in the religious sense, but I don't 
<br>
believe that pacifism can be a one way street. So here is my view on the 
<br>
listed attitude. Its a typical Waspy attitude, that surely persisted before 
<br>
world war two, and has continued unto this hour. As far as I am concerned, 
<br>
the blame Israel crowd is largely the same, whatever the protestations to the 
<br>
contrary, as those who knew about Hitler's ultimate goals, (like the US State 
<br>
Department) and didn't give a shit anyway; and frankly don't today, and 
<br>
secretly enjoy what happened...so be it.
<br>
<p>The USA can change its foreign policy to whatever it wants. Maybe it can be 
<br>
squeezed, but I don't think it you can squeeze it to surrender. So, do your 
<br>
worst. Enjoy your OPEC oil, and remember all those Saudi billionaires who 
<br>
fund the Al Qedas Movement, because next time they'll use sarin, or 
<br>
strontium, or smallpox. But hey, what's more important then a nice portfolio? 
<br>
<p><p>è Negative ma'am.  The United States can do just fine by
<br>
è opening up Alaska and contenting itself with the
<br>
è petroleum rescources here in the Western
<br>
è Hemisphere.  In truth that's likely one reason why
<br>
è liberals want to conserve Alaska (regardless of what
<br>
è rights and  wishs of Alaskan state citizens) and lock
<br>
è up the state in a straitjacket of Wetlands Laws and
<br>
è various pseudo-Green nonsense.   An America that
<br>
è utilized it's own rescources and those of it's natural
<br>
è (geographically adjacent) allies would not NEED to be
<br>
è playing realpolitik on the behalf of Tel Aviv (and would
<br>
è not need the &quot;Excuse&quot; of middle east oil).  I suspect
<br>
è Europe might have to pay it's own way a bit more
<br>
è then.....    What's weird is fossil fuel economies are on
<br>
è their last surge before they are abandoned...why are
<br>
è we &quot;saving&quot; supplies in the Western Hemisphere at the
<br>
è cost of American lives?    cheers, Brian
