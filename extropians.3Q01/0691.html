<em>&gt; Thanks for pointing that out, Lee. Although it should be obvious,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attend church are more likely to believe bogus statistical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analyses which tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to support their belief system. Double Duh!!
</em><br>
<p>This is a typical example of bad statistical analysis.  Without positing a
<br>
cause and effect, it is invalid to conclude that church going makes people
<br>
live longer.  A more likely analysis is that people who live longer (i.e.,
<br>
older) tend to go to church more than younger people.
<br>
<p>Older people grew up in earlier times which were more church oriented.  The
<br>
older people get, the closer they are to death, and the more interested they
<br>
are in an afterlife.  Many activities that are contrary to church-going,
<br>
such as sex or busy weekends, tend to decrease as one gets older.  People
<br>
who died already could not participate in the survey.
<br>
<p>In other words, this survey doesn't show anything except that the average
<br>
church goer is older than the average nonchurch goer!
