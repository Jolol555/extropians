<em>&gt; How do you know what Heston thinks his creator is?
</em><br>
<p>I think it is clear from Heston's other discussions that he believes in a
<br>
Christian God as creator.  I'm not sure this is germane to the discussion.
<br>
<p>I have responded to other points similar to yours in other posts, so I'm not
<br>
going to respond to every point again.  If I miss something important, let
<br>
me know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, why not? US civilization was not predominantly created by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds of africans, chinese, or native americans. Why not give credit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where credit is due?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think Heston implying that whites deserve more credit for US
<br>
civilization than blacks, native Americans, etc.  You are reading some
<br>
implications even farther than I would have imagined.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Hate crime laws are not an example of gay rights.  They are racial laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which sometimes include sexual orientation or gender.  These laws give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sentencing guidelines for criminals not rights to citizens.  Gay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equal-rights laws would be ones advocating marriage, cohabitation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; insurance, joint tax returns, inheriting property, joint ownership of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; property, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But they don't generally do this, they set sentencing guidelines for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who exercise their own rights to not be forced into accepting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lifestyles they view as abhorrent. When these include proscriptions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against using words in speech which gays use as a matter of course in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own intra-gay communications, then the line is crossed into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought repression, equal protection, and first amendment violations.
</em><br>
<p>That's why I make it clear that hate-crime laws are NOT an example of
<br>
equal-rights laws.  They do not have the same purpose or effect.
<br>
<p>I'm not even going to get into the comparison of gun-owners with Holocaust
<br>
victims.  I think this is extreme hyperbole.  Trying to argue that
<br>
gun-owners are victimized as much as Jews is a losing argument in any event.
<br>
Even if you're right, it just sounds whiny at best and anti-Semitic at
<br>
worst.  Why not just say you are unfair victims?  Comparisons to the
<br>
Holocaust or comparing your opponents to Nazis never enlightens a debate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you or do you not think that it is right for a person to not know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when their body tissues are being exposed to an HIV carrier under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions which have been proven to be communicable for the virus?
</em><br>
<p>I do.  But this is irrelevant to my point.  My point is that this was never
<br>
stated by Heston.  Everybody keeps jumping on this because Heston implied
<br>
his position on this without stating it.  This is the perfect example of
<br>
what I was trying to point out.  He gives an example and leaves it up to the
<br>
audience to interpret conclusions from it.  You are arguing for your
<br>
conclusion, which may be correct.  But you are missing the fact that you are
<br>
reading your conclusion into his words.  Heston never stated this position
<br>
explicitly.  Likewise, other implications can be read into his other
<br>
examples that weren't specifically stated.  Some people seem to be insisting
<br>
that their interpretations and conclusions from each example are the only
<br>
possible ones to derive.  I am pointing out that there are no clear
<br>
conclusions from his examples, and different audience members with interpret
<br>
them differently.  Some of those interpretations might be excessively
<br>
reactionary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Which is more accurate? I mean, if a white fellow who was born in South
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Africa or Rhodesia immigrated to the US, does he or does he not have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to call himself an 'African-American'??? Does he then have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to apply for positions in college and employment that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined by the fact that he is 'African-American', to the exclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of other white fellows who were born here in the US, or who immigrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from european nations? If he doesn't have this right, then please
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain why...
</em><br>
<p>Very good point.  Such a person would be an African-American by geographical
<br>
origin.  This could be confusing.  However, African-American as a race
<br>
implies descended from original Africans, just as native Americans implies
<br>
descended from original Americans.  Of course there were earlier and later
<br>
peoples in both places, and history and breeding are blurring all such
<br>
lines.  These definitions all end up meaningless if they are analyzed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since you've decided that 'white' is bad, what about 'european'?
</em><br>
<p>Where did you get the idea that I think &quot;white&quot; is bad?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do the Basques or Lithuanians, who have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little or no common cultural or linguistic connection to other european
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultures, get excluded or are they the default?
</em><br>
<p>Excluded from what?  Default what?  I don't know what you are talking about.
<br>
I am arguing AGAINST dividing people up by race, gender or sexual
<br>
orientation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Apples and oranges, Harvey. He hates rap because rap encourages violence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against police, against the state, and for war and bigotry against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whites in general. Rap IS racist, and therefore, should be treated at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least as much a 'hate crime' as anything said by the KKK. It should not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be celebrated by popular culture.
</em><br>
<p>All true, but it seems inconsistent to claim the right to talk about
<br>
&quot;negros&quot; without being called racist, while then working to stop rap music.
<br>
Freedom of speech is freedom to say bad things as well as good.  Just as
<br>
Heston is describing how political correctness prevents him from saying what
<br>
he wants, he turns around and says rap musicians shouldn't say what they
<br>
want.
<br>
<p>I also think you have an inflated idea of what a hate crime is.  Hate crimes
<br>
give tougher sentences on criminals who commit violent crimes.  They do not
<br>
arrest people for mere words or ideas.  Even if one disagrees with hate
<br>
crime laws, I think you are exaggerating their effect.  I will pay $100 if
<br>
you show me an actual law that proscribes a punishment for mere speech
<br>
without the threat or act of real violence.  I think this is another urban
<br>
legend.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Discussion and action are completely different things, Harvey.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  But he has a definite call to action at the end of the speech.  He
<br>
calls for civil disobedience and for people to &quot;act&quot; when these kinds of
<br>
things occur.  Now he doesn't specify what exact acts should be taken, but
<br>
it is clear that some kind of action is being requested.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This 'code word' term is one more catch phrase of political correctness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police doing their typical hate baiting. And why is what he said wrong?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are all entitled to our own values, we just are not entitled to act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on them all. We cannot be compelled to act contrary to our values (with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few obvious exceptions required by citizenship).
</em><br>
<p>You miss my point again.  I didn't say this viewpoint was bad.  My point is
<br>
that Heston never made this statement.  He gave an example and everybody get
<br>
the implication that we don't have to like homosexuality.  He never said
<br>
this.  My point is that if this &quot;implication&quot; is clear from the example
<br>
without him saying it, what other examples are clear from the other examples
<br>
about blacks, Jews, African-Americans, women, transvestites, transsexuals,
<br>
etc.?  Do these examples also imply that we don't have to like them or
<br>
cooperate with them?  This is my point, that the implications being read
<br>
into his speech go beyond what the literal words can be shown to say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I imagine you mean that 'cream' is one more 'code word' for 'elite white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people'.
</em><br>
<p>No, but I did assume that Harvard scholars are mostly rich white straight
<br>
males.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, it's not. It was his money being invested in ICE-T's work, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was his right to express his displeasure at how his money was being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spent. By expressing his displeasure, he was able to illuminate other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stockholders as to how their own money was being invested, and they made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own decisions. Pop music is not speech, it is commerce.
</em><br>
<p>Why did this example appear in a song about free speech?  He clearly was
<br>
showing that he would not tolerate this kind of speech as an example of the
<br>
kind of free speech he was advocating.  What was this whole example about
<br>
and why was it in this speech about freedom of speech if he wasn't talking
<br>
about freedom of speech?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He was promoting the fact that most of western civilization was created
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by whites, and white males generally. Emphasizing one does not mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being opposed to the other.
</em><br>
<p>Here you go again.  Even I never read this much into Heston's position.
<br>
Although you disagree with my assessments, in some ways you even go farther
<br>
than I do in interpreting Heston's speech.  I think your viewpoints validate
<br>
some of my claims about what some people might read into this speech.  I
<br>
think your statement above is exaggerated, but I am sure that you read these
<br>
implications into Heston's words.  This is exactly the ideas that I was
<br>
afraid would be read into this speech.
<br>
<p>As with my other post, I will conclude by saying that I think we are agreed
<br>
about freedom of speech and equal rights for all.  I think we agree that
<br>
special privileges for one group is bad.  The words surrounding race or
<br>
gender politics are so charged that we each can read the same set of words
<br>
and interpret them totally differently.  I am more encouraged by our
<br>
agreements on freedom then our specific differences of opinion on any
<br>
particular wording.
