<p>This doesn't make any sense to me.  My problem with most of
<br>
those who do not appreciate diversity is that they insist on
<br>
seeing my packaging rather than who I am as a person.  They have
<br>
bad opinions toward lesbians say and since I am one of them they
<br>
see their opinions of lesbians instead of simply seeing me.  It
<br>
is not me putting myself in a box or boxes but me fighting to be
<br>
seen as person first and all these various properties of this
<br>
person second.  People come and a wonderful assortment of
<br>
flavors.  Be sure to collect the entire set! &lt;g&gt;
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Well, under some conditions I like separatism and zenophobia,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is no longer a world where separatism and xenophobia are very
<br>
workable.  So, to some degree, we need to get over it while
<br>
preserving our ability to be as different as we are and as like
<br>
as we are.
