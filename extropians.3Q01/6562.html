</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Indeed. Much is of course simply due to the emotional distress, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;causes a high level of arousal and hence inhibits creative thinking in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;favor of well-rehearsed quick actions - i.e. blasting somebody rather

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;than taking the time to do a serious, scrupulously fair trial.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Personally I see my role right now as scurrying around trying to protect

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;of very dangerous decisions that will have long term effects will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;made, for example in encryption law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;More people really should read Popper and Machiavelli. And we really
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ain't that the truth!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, it's not. You need to really understand that a switch has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flipped here, but its not permanent. Our country, at least, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structured to function this way in event of war, and it is structured to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be flipped back once war has been won. When attacked, our congress is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed to empower the president to act as a temporary limited dictator
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the duration of conflict, whose authority devolves back to congress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the people at the conclusion of that conflict.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>And don't think it is at all as binary as that.  The president
<br>
can't simply do anything and everything he likes even in a time
<br>
of war.  Otherwise, the first good war that came along, some
<br>
power-grabbing president would dissolve Congress, rip up the
<br>
Constitution, implement full martial law and we would never be a
<br>
free people again. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It is true that this has been strained by WWII and the 50 years of Cold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War following it (and the past decade of terrorism following the Cold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War), but it can be said that this is the result when a nation refuses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to proceed to a fully conclusive victory. This is generally because we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dislike conflict, we dislike dictating to others, and our Presidents,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contrary to opposition propaganda, generally dislike weilding such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excessive executive power as much as Cincinnatus did 2300+ years ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Cincinnatus was not a US president of course and no US president
<br>
is ever given that much power for any reason.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; We have repeatedly, throughout the 20th century, refused to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete victory in War in so many ways. We've permitted tyrants,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totalitarian regiemes, and piratical organizations to continue to exist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refusing to call up the intestinal fortitude to see things to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proper conclusion, to demand the establishment of proper peaceful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies in so many places. I shall note that nations like Germany and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Japan, who we committed to defeat utterly, are now among the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peaceful and democratic nations on earth. This is the goal we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pursue in every conflict.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It is our refusal to commit totally to make the world truly 'safe for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy' that has resulted in the present state of things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So what are you saying?  That we should go to war with each and
<br>
every nation on the face of the earth that is not a democracy,
<br>
beat the shit out of it until it surrenders and then spend a lot
<br>
of wealth and energy rebuilding it as a democracy?  Do you
<br>
actually thing that is our duty or something?  Or simply
<br>
something we have every right to do or what?
<br>
<p><p><p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; After defeat of Germany and Japan, we refused Patton's recommendation to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go on against Stalin, and later we held back against MacArthur's wish to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strike Communist China in the Korean War. In the Gulf War, we held back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against continuing on to Bagdad to depose Hussein's government and clean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq out of all WOMD technologies. Just last year, Clinton held back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against nailing bin Laden when provided with concrete information as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whereabouts of him and his associates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We must demand that nations end their support of such covert activities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disregarding the laws of war that prohibit actions against civilians,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that combatants must wear distinguishing uniforms and belong to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognisable command structures. Societies which refuse to act according
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the laws of war must be pounded until they cry uncle and acquiesce to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our just demands, must accept restructuring of their societies into open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democratic nations, where educational systems cannot program their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; students with hate, with glory for martyrdom. Everyone must be taught
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true history, not propaganda.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But we ourselves have at times acted contrary to these &quot;rules&quot;. 
<br>
Our own militia during the Revolutionary war did not always
<br>
exactly run big on distinquishing uniforms and recognisable
<br>
command structures.  
<br>
<p>Who says it is our right to beat up every state and people that
<br>
do not act in this manner toward one another?  Much less our
<br>
duty?
<br>
<p>The first law of war is to avoid it if possible.
<br>
<p>Failing that, the second law of war is to win it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Just as the Holocaust cannot be denied, the criminal acts of terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can no longer be glorified, rationalized, excused, worshipped,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respected, or condoned. Societies which refuse to do so must be shut off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the world, and if need be, pounded to dust.
</em><br>
<p>Blockage and sanctions work to some degree.  Pounding to dust is
<br>
at best a figure of speech.  Full pounding to dust is pointless
<br>
and wasteful of much life and resources.  It is inhumane even
<br>
beyond the inhumanity of war itself.  Pound enough to cause a
<br>
surrender or a takeover where necessary but not to dust.
