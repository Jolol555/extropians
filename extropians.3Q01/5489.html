</em><br>
<p>Well, you can. It's not very hard. It is then useful to destroy your
<br>
fingerprint, though, as e.g. even short passages of text can be
<br>
statistically analyzed for your word frequency and phrase fingerprint,
<br>
which is rather unique.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In theory, governments with powerful enough computers can spy on every
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>In theory. In practice, you have to install the hardware at ISP side.
<br>
Tapping cables is a lot like drinking from a firehose.
<br>
<p>If they do, it will not do them an awful lot of good, because the packet's
<br>
content is opaque, and the packet's apparent destination is not it's true
<br>
destination. It is routed through a remixer network.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; by the IP address and other infomation in the packet header alone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if you use encryption, your packet must have headers for it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get to where you want it to go.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but the contents of the envelope -- which are encrypted -- will
<br>
contain an another envelope. Which is encrypted. Which contains another
<br>
envelope -- you get the general idea. The nodes themselves have no clue
<br>
what is inside the envelope passing through it, and they don't know wheat
<br>
the next node is going to be.
<br>
<p>Traffic remixers and onion routers do really exist and do really work.
<br>
Ask feds, they just patented them a few days ago, almost 20 years after
<br>
they have been described in academic papers, and 15 years after the first
<br>
ones started operating. They're a key to a truly anonymous infrastructure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With such packet sniffing at strategic points on the Net (such as each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country's gateways to the rest of the Net) and comparing it with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seized web logs or even publicly available information such as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; date and time a message appears on a message board, a government can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incriminate its citizens for the transmission of data.
</em><br>
<p>I'm afraid the method I mentioned above will make such expensive snooping
<br>
fruitless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The packet sniffer can also reveal a lot of information about the
</em><br>

<p>So, whiten your traffic with bogus packets. You thought your ssh
<br>
connection was secure? I'm afraid it ain't so, chief, because a simple
<br>
mathematical model of your typing pattern leaks bits like crazy.
<br>
<p>So, use lots of whitening. It's good for you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; information network of the future provides access to only a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selected group of trusted people, the information about servers users
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can connect to will have to remain public.
</em><br>
<p>You can connect, and you can take the network out from the inside, by
<br>
iterating the process. However, some patches on the earth are freer than
<br>
others, and unless The Man will completely block all traffic there, you
<br>
can connect there. If you wound up on the wrong patch of the geoid, I
<br>
suggest to head for freer places. It's worth it. If there are no freer
<br>
places left, I suggest picking up an interesting hobby. Like conspiracy to
<br>
overthrow the local government.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Using the anonymous nature of the Net against itself and from an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overseas site, the government can also act as a new user and use the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software to find out information about the initial servers the peer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peer software can connect to. From there, it can find all these other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; servers and instantly ban their IP addresses, or at least the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combination of IP addresses and ports with the unwanted service over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at its own Internet Gateways.
</em><br>
<p>Realtime address banning is nice, but you can only see a few IPs, as a
<br>
blacknet node. You have to reveal your IP for them to be able to deal with
<br>
you.  Becase they know they drop dead from the net once they deal with a
<br>
certain IP (otherwise realtime banning would be hardly realtime), they
<br>
reenter the network (most IPs nowadays are dynamic, duh), and propagate
<br>
the information that you're a rat. Moreover, we have a very nice upsurge
<br>
of IEEE 802.11x networks, where users own the ad hoc infrastructure. Much
<br>
good the banning will do you, then. Then, there's trust building. New
<br>
users will be automatically assumed rats, and a rat will have to serve the
<br>
network, before doing it's dirty deed (did I mention that the
<br>
infrastucture was agoric?), thus becoming a very valuable rat. Same
<br>
applies in attempting flooding. You can't flood, unless you sell your
<br>
storage and bandwidth space. Content hashes don't collide. So, your only
<br>
attempt will be name space pollution. The hashes themselves are
<br>
invulnerable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, I will consider it a miracle if such surveillance does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already takes place today. Carnivore, or DCS1000 (whatever they had
</em><br>
<p>The average fed is too dumb for that. But the name engineering was sneaky,
<br>
wasn't it? Carnivore was a blunder, DCS1000 is inspired. But, however they
<br>
name it, they're screwed. They will only catch the sheep, not the wolves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; renamed it to) shows only a very simple and weak version of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surveillance software that can potentially exist. In fact, it only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerns itself more with mail traffic. If you wonder about web
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traffic, just checking through the logs of a Proxy Server at the ISP
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can tell you who did what at where (meanwhile banning all port 80
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outbound just like what some Singapore ISPs did to all overseas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sites).
</em><br>
<p>So, mail and web to anywhere but localhost will have to go. Hint: look at
<br>
Freenet and Mojonation document addresses. See that localhost part?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Using Artifical Intelligence technology of the future, expect to see a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of smiling faces at Government Network Headquarters over their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; success at tracing posters.
</em><br>
<p>Dumb posters, maybe. But, I somehow don't expect a lot of smiling feds.
<br>
Call it a hunch, or something.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There also exists one possibility that we had not yet see on the Net:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Proxy-Spoofing&quot;. This term (that I created a year ago) represents a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept that allows one to spoof another user's identity provided it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can determine what a user will do in the near future. On a plain-text
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connection, this allows the any devious Government (or person with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control of the Internet gateway) to spoof another user's packet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhat like two-way lying.
</em><br>
<p>Try doing that with Gale.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We take the case of posting to a newsgroup. Firstly, the spoofer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intercepts the poster's packet en route. Secondly, it drops this
</em><br>
<p>How does he I know I'm posting to a newsgroup? Mallory can watch all the
<br>
anonymous remailers, much good it will do to him. He sees packets emerging
<br>
from me and entering the remixing network. He loses track of these packets
<br>
after just a few iterations of traffic remixing. He sees lots of nasty
<br>
packets in clear entering gateways into public fora, but he can't trace it
<br>
back to me, provided I stripped the message clear of my fingerprint
<br>
(Google translator reiterated would come to mind).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; packet from routing and injects a new packet in with identical headers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but different content, such that the data does not match the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data. For instance, the Government can just place an additional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement that contains defamatory remarks such that the user gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into trouble with lawsuits or with Government laws.
</em><br>
<p>If you insist to use broken tools, they will catch you. So, don't use
<br>
broken tools.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With encryption, it can experience some problems but not too much that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we cannot solve it. With the method below, a nasty Government can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still get its hands on the decryption sequence and do on the fly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decrypting and encrypting.
</em><br>
<p>Your concerns are not new, and have been addressed in late 1980s.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A Government can also create a huge database of valid addresses and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destination that it permits while banning all other addresses, citing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pornography or other issues to justify this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To get around the problem of banning too many of the wrong sites, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could provide users with a unencrypted-only link for accessing other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sites. Censors or censor-bots can then analyse what the user saw and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did, and if it determined that the site provides no harm, it can add
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this site to the database.
</em><br>
<p>A police state is not addressed by things cypherpunkly, it is best
<br>
addressed in physical space with military hardware. See the conspiracy for
<br>
the purpose to overthrow the government part.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can try sending an encrypted packet, but even if the Government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; router cannot understand this data, it can at least corrupt or destroy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<p>See above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In addition, Governments can create backdoors into user's computers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; via spyware. Under the guise of a free Government accounting software,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free ISP software or something which spurs users to downlod the file,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Government can potentially monitor every tap of a user, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if this user has a broadband Internet connection.
</em><br>
<p>Once again, not being dumb helps.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To avoid detection, the software can use the user's web browser (such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Internet Explorer) to send data, and working with a proxy server,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can merely pretend to access a website the user previously and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frequently accesses but with a special header or distinct signature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such that the Governmental Proxy Server will intercept this instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passing it on as it usually does.
</em><br>
<p>So, only run trusted software. Do all the nasty bits stuff on an airgap
<br>
protected machine, or in a hardware crypto containment. It's as easy as
<br>
that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We don't even need a lot of data, just some passwords and private PGP
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keys. Once it gets into the system, it can also spread through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole network like a network worm.
</em><br>
<p>See above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There exists a rumor that M$ wants to replace the current TCP/IP
</em><br>
<em>&gt; network with another of its proprietary design to &quot;fix&quot; a problem that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; originated with it providing raw sockets capability in Windows XP
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which can potentially make an ordinary computer a very powerful DDOS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack machine. We must take the idea that the Net may switch to a
</em><br>
<p>Once you corrupted a remote system with a magic packet, you own it. Why
<br>
relying on Redmond's crappy stacks if you can use your own? Upgrade it
<br>
with the best of *BSD derived offerings. Speaking of which, we should
<br>
thank proprietary vendors for offering us free resources to run BlackNode
<br>
nodes, packaged in worms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; more traceable system seriously that will deny anonymous connections
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for fear of a DDOS attack.
</em><br>
<p>If you don't speak anything else than the lingua franca of the Internet,
<br>
you've just severed yourself from the network. Many vendors tried that,
<br>
and all of them failed, with AOL being a possible exception.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I propose here may consist of workable or unworkable situations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, we must take notice of this and perhaps develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countermeasures beyond the current network system. This means that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developing peer to peer systems may seem insufficient, but we may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually need to stop the passing of certain laws and International
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Treaties that threaten this freedom.
</em><br>
<p>Good concerns. I suggest you google over to cypherpunks, and start
<br>
reading.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do not know any new counter-measures not in public discussion as of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now, but I hope, by setting all of you to ponder this issue, that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may eventually develop a suitable and powerful counter-measure.
</em><br>
<p>The specs and the theory is all there. All we need are coders.
