<p><p>As has been noted by others, it is all good and well if you trust the
<br>
current administration to use their powers wisely and justly.  But who are
<br>
you to predict the character of future administrations?  Many fine political
<br>
institutions have been put to perverse use by bad people, something the
<br>
creators and supporters of those institutions would have dismissed as an
<br>
absurd improbability.
<br>
<p>Though many people assume otherwise, Hitler didn't create many of the laws
<br>
that he used to forward his twisted world view.  Many were created by benign
<br>
prior administrations and then put into use in ways that, while technically
<br>
legitimate, were far beyond what the original authors had imagined.  This is
<br>
how many tyrannies happen in the western world, it would serve us well to
<br>
pay attention to such things.
