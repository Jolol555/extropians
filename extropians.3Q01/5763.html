Hello everybody
<br>
I' ve been pondering some questions about the concept of singularity and its meaning in transhumanist philosophy.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Certainly the term is a bit difficult to trace sometimes, since it comes from Teilhard de Chardins thoughts of the Omega- point (now that is a shaaaky fellow, but more on TDC some other time) and also from the tiplerite tradition, but I have seen also less &quot;mystical&quot; definitions of the term.
<br>
Also, not all of us think that a singularity is possible- but is it desireable as a philosophical concept to be present in the discourse?
<br>
<p>I ask my self: isn't the concept of a singularity the last grasp of Christian escathologism? 
<br>
That the concept of an unlimited development became a far too great leap, that you had to invent an end time?
<br>
A time after which progress would be so immense that discussion of it would be pointless, often with the discussion falling down into an abstract paradise.
<br>
But hasn't the introduction of escathology also introduced the concept of immanentism in transhumanism, with all its perils?
<br>
Virtue is achieved through action, actions that may be very, very, very much more complex than ours- but there is still action required to achieve virtue. 
<br>
The Omega- point seen as inert, thus it is not virtuous.
<br>
Thus the Omega point is not a state of Eudaimonia. 
<br>
Could there also be a danger that the discourse about the concept of an Omega point damages transhumanist philosophy today? Sometimes when I listen to discussions about a possible Omega point I get very afraid. 
<br>
It takes us out in very deep waters indeed, speaking about things we have very little knowledge of. 
<br>
An indeed unknown future, that is very far ahead, while neglecting the path to it?
<br>
The truth is out there, but it is damned hard to reach.
<br>
I see the danger that we get into discussing how many angels (or Jupiter brains in our case) that can dance on a needle's head. The philosophical cul de sac that was broken so many centuries ago (but continues today with the postmodernists: how many different readings can you get on a single page of one of Zizek's books?). Philosophy is a search for the right goals in the lives people both as individuals and as part of a society. We may set our goals very high indeed, but they are still acknowledgable as a philosophic problem.
<br>

Comments?

Thoughts?

<br>
Yours questioningly,
