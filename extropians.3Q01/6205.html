<p><em>&gt;I can see a *very* positive effect of not hitting back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If the US follow the trail to the culprits and bring them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;justice legally USA would be seen as impeccably just and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even-handed. They would remain the victim in the tragedy. Sympathy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be with USA and the poor civilians who suffered (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continue to suffer) from this terrible act.
</em><br>
<p>This is not the way it is going to happen, this is not some silly
<br>
game. An act of war has been commited against the United States,
<br>
and as soon as we have a good idea of who did it, we're going after
<br>
them. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If, however, USA goes off half-cocked firing blindly at all comers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then the pain of the people in the WTC will be overshadowed and,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worldwide, less people will feel sympathy. Worse, those who get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;struck but were innocent will be the next round of terrorists to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kill more US citizens.
</em><br>
<p>The end result of upcoming actions should be to put a permanent end
<br>
to world terrorism. After we get done with the people responsible
<br>
for the attack, it would be a good idea to get together with other
<br>
nations who feel the same way.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;To avoid over-reaction would be to help defuse the whole thing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make everybody feel safer, and turn world opinion massively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against the terrorists. The bad guys would lose in a big way. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it would have to be followed up with softening foreign policy. USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has done some despicable things around the world. Australia is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;angel here either (Bougainville makes me moan).
</em><br>
<p><p>The bad guys are all going to be dead. U. S. foreign policy will be
<br>
tougher after this, not softer.
