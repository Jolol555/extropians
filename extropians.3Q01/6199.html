From: &quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20TERRORISM:%20looking%20for%20solutions&In-Reply-To=&lt;005d01c13baa$9a455a40$c8c8f418@southmount.com&gt;">bradbury@aeiveos.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, in memory of today's sad events I would like to challenge the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of the Extropian community to think long and hard about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what ways might be used to create innovative solutions to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism that would increase trustability and personal security
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without imposing restrictions on freedoms (in other words, please,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please lets not make it a debate about guns).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, with the situation at hand, a couple of ideas occured to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At the first sign of any struggle to take over a &quot;flying bomb&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the plane could be programmed to enter autopilot mode such that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it could only be unlocked using commands from the ground after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flight controllers could convince themselves that the pilots were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in control.  Obviously this has problems with technical difficulties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as loss of communications.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another possibility would be a more sophisticated program that would cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the plane to fly itself to &quot;safe&quot; locations such as military air bases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Monitors for vocal stress patterns in pilot communications would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another possibility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Presumably we will need a multipy prong strategy in the end so I think your
<br>
hi-tech solution and others proposed have much merit. I wonder about
<br>
something as low tech and banal as double doors to the cockpit such that
<br>
only one person at a time can get through; with entry and exit controlled
<br>
from the cockpit. Presumably the thinking in the past was that the pilots
<br>
were somewhat protected by the bargaining chip of being the only ones
<br>
capable of flying the plane. Since this is obviously not the case, the
<br>
cockpit in particular needs to be better protected. A separate air supply
<br>
for the cockpit, and the ability to release an anesthic gas into the cabin,
<br>
might also be part of an overall strategy.
<br>
(This terrible terrible tragedy has also affected us slightly here in
<br>
Canada. Our airports also were shut down yesterday in part to allow
<br>
international flights destined for  NY or Washington to land. I live close
<br>
to a little airport in Mnt Hope (about 70K from Toronto) and we took four
<br>
flights in here. Apparently the passangers were not told what was going on
<br>
until they landed. Imagine thinking you are going to land in NY and getting
<br>
off in Mnt Hope. The poor passengers had to wait around for hours to get
<br>
their paper work processed.  Our airport is almost never used for
<br>
international flights except during an emergency so there were not enough
<br>
customs officials around to process the 1000 passengers. I understand the
<br>
Mounties were pressed into service).
