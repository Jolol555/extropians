Samantha commented on my comment regarding whose hands the
<br>
&quot;blood of billions&quot; shall stain and whether any of them/us
<br>
will be around in need of absolution (you can see my Catholic
<br>
background showing here...).
<br>
<p>While I understand your point Samantha, I believe my fears
<br>
and your fears lie in different areas.  I'm less afraid of
<br>
nanotech and more afraid of amoral AIs than you probably
<br>
are (correct me if this is incorrect).  I also don't believe
<br>
I would want to live in a world managed by any kind of
<br>
intelligent SysOp (no matter how friendly).  That probably
<br>
derives from my growing up in Massachusetts, right next
<br>
to the &quot;Live free or die&quot; state of New Hampshire.  There
<br>
are also the Tea Party &amp; Concord Green incidents that are
<br>
part of my heritage.  You can take the boy out of Boston
<br>
but can't take the Boston out of the boy.
<br>
<p>However, I don't view our perspectives as mutually exclusive
<br>
given the current state of the universe (lots of matter
<br>
and energy for constructing things and lots of physical
<br>
&quot;space&quot; that can be allocated for security zones).  So
<br>
it seems like both of our visions are realizable.  However
<br>
what doesn't seem realizable to me is the &quot;resurrection&quot;
<br>
of those whose information content is irretrievably lost.
<br>
We may be able to recreate a reasonable facsimile of Sasha,
<br>
one that I can even &quot;believe&quot; is him, but in my heart I
<br>
will always question how close it can be to the original.
<br>
<p>The blood of billions *will* be on the hands of those arguing
<br>
against cryonics whether or not the reanimations or recreations
<br>
are done with or without either nanotech or the SysOp.
<br>
<p>Robert
