<p><em>&gt; After doing some research a while back, I basically went from agnostic to

</em><br>
<p>This is not scientific, only my own experiences and opinion.
<br>
<p>For a couple of years in my life I lived in New England and met many people
<br>
who went private schools, to chi-chi college prep schools and then to
<br>
Harvard-Dartmouth-Yale and such colleges (this was my exposure to a
<br>
different tradition than that to which I was exposed, i.e., a middle-class
<br>
West Coast public school life).
<br>
<p>And how different did I find the &quot;Top Ten&quot; East Coast crowd compared to the
<br>
people I'd known before?  Not different at all.  More snooty, definitely.
<br>
Many of the young men spoke with a uniformly affected whiny nasal
<br>
inflection - and that very well may have been the biggest difference, right
<br>
there.  The private-school crowd were just as smart, and just as dumb, as
<br>
anyone I'd ever known before.  The fact that many of the East Coast crowd
<br>
seemed to think of themselves as &quot;anointed&quot; compared to the rest of the
<br>
world's population was somewhat vexing to me.  But one incident, especially,
<br>
still stands out in my mind:  I overheard several young wives talk about
<br>
another young wife who stuttered a little (all the respective wives had
<br>
husbands who were graduate students at Tuck Business School), tsk-tsk'g
<br>
about what a liability the wife with the stutter would be for her husband.
<br>
But this was a generation ago.  Maybe things have changed.
<br>
<p>But I still don't think private school students get a better education
<br>
compared to students who go to public schools, generally.  What is
<br>
&quot;education,&quot; anyway?  Maybe children who go to private schools become
<br>
culturally deprived, in a way.  I know my own kids benefited from the
<br>
diversity of people they found in public schools throughout their school
<br>
years - they've actually expressed this to me.
