<p>Just as today there are businesses that find an increasingly lucrative
<br>
market among women, immigrants, people of color, and gays. Now they
<br>
cater to traditionally oppressed groups not in some selfless do-gooder
<br>
crusade but simply because their money is as green as anybody
<br>
else's. Everywhere and everyplace there are always merchants shrewd
<br>
enough to go after that money if governments don't interfere (with
<br>
laws like the ones banning women from voting, banning gays from
<br>
marrying or enlisting in the regional security monopoly, aparteid,
<br>
etc.)
<br>
<p>The corollary of this is that if you want to advance the cause of
<br>
whatever group you belong to, the key is to become an economic
<br>
force to be reckoned with.
<br>
<p>The Jim Crow era was really a fight between the liberal Federal
<br>
government and certain reactionary state governments. While it does
<br>
cast doubt on the Republican &quot;State's Rights&quot; doctrine it only lends
<br>
support to anarcho-libertarianism, because if there weren't any
<br>
governments passing irrational laws in the first place, intervention
<br>
from an even higher level of government would not have been necessary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Libertarians don't favor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outlawing stupidity, but stupidity should have its costs.
</em><br>
<p>It does, by definition, except when some do-gooder authority
<br>
decides to redistribute these costs and protect the stupid
<br>
from the consequences of their actions.
