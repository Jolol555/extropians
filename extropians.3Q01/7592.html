[Note from Matthew Gaylor:  Again more defeatist compromising 
<br>
commentary.  Reason Magazine's contributing editor Cathy Young 
<br>
writes: &quot;Do I like the idea of people being able to encrypt 
<br>
electronic communications so that they are beyond surveillance? 
<br>
Frankly, I found it scary even before Sept. 11 - precisely because of 
<br>
the threat of terrorism. It is said that there are no atheists in 
<br>
foxholes; perhaps there are no true libertarians in times of 
<br>
terrorist attacks.  Even in the Declaration of Independence, the 
<br>
right to liberty is preceded by the right to life.&quot; In this case I 
<br>
found Cypherpunk Tim May's &lt;<a href="mailto:tcmay@got.net?Subject=Re:%20Defeatist%20Compromising%20Commentary%20From%20Reason%20Magazine&In-Reply-To=&lt;v04220807b7d81b1d7441@[198.4.94.213]&gt;">tcmay@got.net</a>&gt; sarcastic comment right on 
<br>
the money.  Tim writes:  &quot;Between Cato arguing for victim disarmament 
<br>
and Reason arguing that &quot;right to liberty is preceded by the right to 
<br>
life,&quot; I say we just kill them all and let Rand sort them out.&quot;  If 
<br>
you find Ms. Young's comments against encryption disturbing please

<br>
<p>Civil liberties may take a hit
<br>
<p>By Cathy Young
<br>
<p>It's such a cliche to say that the reality hasn't sunk in yet -- but 
<br>
it's true. Despite all the devastating images, part of me still 
<br>
doesn't belive that the Twin Towers are no more, or that the station 
<br>
where I have so often arrived in downtown New York by local train 
<br>
station from New Jersey lies under a pile of rubble, or that 
<br>
thousands are dead in what is unquestionably the most devastating 
<br>
terrorist act ever committed, not just on American soil but anywhere.
<br>
<p>And there are so many other cliches that come so easily right now and 
<br>
that are true: above all, that the world will never be the same.
<br>
<p>As always, there are those who would exploit an unthinkable tragedy 
<br>
for their own hateful agendas. On the left, a few commentators, such 
<br>
as filmmaker-activist Michael Moore, have found this a good time to 
<br>
decry the sins of American capitalism and US foreign policy for which 
<br>
we are supposedly being punished by the world's dispossessed.
<br>
<p>On the right, a few so-called men of God have found this a good time 
<br>
to decry the &quot;wickedness&quot; of gays and lesbians, feminists, the 
<br>
American Civil Liberties Union, and abortion providers, for which we 
<br>
are supposedly being punished by the Lord.
<br>
<p>So far, however, the divisive rhetoric isn't finding many takers.
<br>
<p>Americans are united in mourning and just anger. The way we have come 
<br>
together to help and support those affected by the horror of last 
<br>
week's bombings shows us at our best as a people.
<br>
<p>And yet moments of national unity and resolve are always of concern 
<br>
to those of us who are concerned with the expanding powers of the 
<br>
state and the fate of individual rights and civil liberties.
<br>
<p>Historically, individual freedom has not fared well in wartime, 
<br>
understandably so. And whatever military action we may take at the 
<br>
moment, one of the fears is that a war against terrorism may be, at 
<br>
least for the foreseeable future, a permanent war.
<br>
<p>There are libertarians who say that it doesn't have to be that way. 
<br>
They argue that, if our government only withdrew from meddling in 
<br>
regions where we have no real interest, stop playing global 
<br>
policeman, and limited itself to providing for a national defense 
<br>
against foreign attack, we wouldn't be a terrorist target.
<br>
<p>Alas, this is a myopic position. Aside from whether a 21st century 
<br>
democracy can survive in isolation, the sort of people who carried 
<br>
out this monstrous act hate us for much more than our foreign policy.
<br>
<p>Note that their targets included not only the Pentagon and 
<br>
(apparently) Capitol Hill or the White House, but the World Trade 
<br>
Center - a symbol and a bastion of international capitalism, not of 
<br>
US military power.
<br>
<p>Philosopher David Kelley, director of the Objectivist Center, makes 
<br>
this point eloquently in an essay on the center's Web site, &quot;The 
<br>
Assault on Civilization.&quot; (which strikes a chord whether or not one 
<br>
shares the center's philosophy, based on the writings of Ayn Rand).
<br>
<p>The fanatics behind the bombings, Kelley writes, hate the West's 
<br>
cultural power most - &quot;our secular culture of freedom, reason, and 
<br>
the pursuit of happiness. They hate our individualism; what they want 
<br>
is an authoritarian society where thought and behavior are controlled 
<br>
by true believers.&quot;
<br>
<p>We could stay out of world affairs and they would still hate and fear 
<br>
our influence.
<br>
<p>What to do, then?
<br>
<p>To sacrifice our freedoms to fear of terrorism would destroy the very 
<br>
way of life that we seek to protect and hand the terrorists a 
<br>
victory. On the other hand, a free society is not a suicide pact.
<br>
<p>We will undoubtedly have to put up with tougher security at airports. 
<br>
The movements of foreign visitors will be scrutinized more closely. 
<br>
Perhaps most alarming to many civil libertarians, it's likely that 
<br>
the government will expand its ability to monitor electronic mail, 
<br>
which has been a controversial issue for some time.
<br>
<p>Do I like the idea of the government intercepting e-mail? No. But, as 
<br>
long as there's judicial oversight and due process, that's no 
<br>
different from its longstanding power to intercept regular mail.
<br>
<p>Do I like the idea of people being able to encrypt electronic 
<br>
communications so that they are beyond surveillance? Frankly, I found 
<br>
it scary even before Sept. 11 - precisely because of the threat of 
<br>
terrorism.
<br>
<p>It is said that there are no atheists in foxholes; perhaps there are 
<br>
no true libertarians in times of terrorist attacks.
<br>
<p>Even in the Declaration of Independence, the right to liberty is 
<br>
preceded by the right to life.
