<em>&gt; In a paper (&quot;Are You Living in a Simulation?&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/sim/simulation.doc">http://www.nickbostrom.com/sim/simulation.doc</a>) recommended by Brian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Atkins, Nick Bostrom argues that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  at least one of the following propositions is true:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; posthuman stage; (2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; run significant number of simulations or (variations) of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evolutionary history; (3) we are almost certainly living in a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His argument is plausible, but I would argue that it gives us no cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to change our behavior.  It has the same feel as this parody of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christian's claim: &quot;There exists an omnipotent, omniscient being who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost never interferes in the world we perceive.&quot;  In both cases, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence is proffered; in fact, in both cases the claim is that evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't exist because of the way the system is set up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>And that is exactly reasonable.  If we are in a sim or (more or
<br>
less equivalently) there exist this omnipotent, omniscient being
<br>
(at least relative to us) then in both cases relatively little
<br>
this world or this sim evidence is exactly what should be
<br>
expected.  However, I find it interesting that now and then in
<br>
every culture there are those who claim to have contacted or
<br>
been contacted by that outside this world/sim.  If we were in a
<br>
sim then a lot of systems of spirituality at least in their
<br>
esoteric details could be an attempt to express the nature of
<br>
this world as &quot;illusion&quot; or derivative from some other reality. 
<br>
Stories of an &quot;astral plane&quot; or &quot;causal plane&quot; map pretty well
<br>
to the level of the software itself and the programmer[s] behind
<br>
it.  Well, at least with a bit of squinting they do.  
<br>
<p>Another possibility I toy with is that when this world goes into
<br>
Singularity we need in good faith to make a place for those who
<br>
do not want to be in the Singularity for whatever reason.  They
<br>
want and/or need to live in a pre-Singularity world.  They have
<br>
too much unfinished business in that sort of world.  Yet we do
<br>
not wish them to simply die in misery nor can the future be put
<br>
on hold to satisfy their needs.  What to do?  One possibility is
<br>
to put all such people into sim worlds that are as they wish to
<br>
live in or are right for the level they are dealing with and
<br>
perhaps stuck on.  When they die in the sim they are not lost
<br>
but can evaluate their life and choose what is next in
<br>
cooperation with those who help in such evaluations.  They pick
<br>
a next situation or it picks them and they are reborn, usually
<br>
forgetting the old life and the time of evaluation and/or rest
<br>
in between.  They do this on a particular level until they are
<br>
done with that level and ready to move on.  
<br>
<p>Note that this is quite doable in principle and is almost
<br>
exactly what some of the Eastern religions teach.  Does it give
<br>
you just a little bit of pause over where these teachings
<br>
actually came from and what they are about?  Does it at least
<br>
make you think of how we can design in reality post-Singularity
<br>
so that all sentient being may have the space and time to live
<br>
fully and to evolve?  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should we try to make the simulation end as the Tibetan Buddhists are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reputed to be doing?  Should we do what we can to lengthen the extent of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the simulation, at the cost of foregoing some things we would otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chose to do?  If we wanted to lengthen or shorten the span of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation, what evidence do we have about what actions would be effective?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In light of the above I doubt it is that simple or that we are
<br>
in charge of the simulation.  Due to Singularity we will simply
<br>
become cognizant and part of the creation and running of the
<br>
sim.  Some will step to the next level permanently.  Some need
<br>
more time in this and other sims.  Who knows how many levels
<br>
there are or how many we will create?  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Better to believe that the universe is as it presents itself to us, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose goals and approaches based on that evidence.  A creator that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanted us to do otherwise (or that put conscious entities in a situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where that was the best thing to do) is not worth bowing to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Are you sure about that?  Perhaps the purpose of this Sim is to
<br>
create and evolve new sentients that gradually themselves become
<br>
evolved, intelligent and wise enough to create more sentience in
<br>
their turn.  Perhaps this world, this level of sim, is like a
<br>
glider gun for the creation of Singularities and new sims in
<br>
their turn. 
<br>
<p>Of course there is no proof of this within the sim directly.
