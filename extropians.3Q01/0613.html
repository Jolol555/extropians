Religious war is fine with me...just keep it friendly; at least as
<br>
friendly as an NHL hockey match. Both Bush and Vatican use the expression
<br>
&quot;Culture of Life&quot; as loosely as drunks in a beer parlour. But let's ask
<br>
them to sober up and tell us about their faith expressed in public works
<br>
as a model city plus surroundings. Then let's see who will buy in.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi, all! I got this off the Extropy website and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wonder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; at this point what it all means to us. I realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am pretty green on this list, and that we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; all believe everything we read, but I think you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; understand the source and nature my questioning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, I have to say that I don't. What _is_ your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; questioning?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If I don't know that, I can't understand the source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry, Mike. &quot;Blah blah blah...wonder what it all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means to us.&quot; was a suggestion of it. I was trying not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be antagonistic, and at times being too direct can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause people to think this. The perils of being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newbie, I guess. :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, my question is this: the recent religious war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to fly in the face of most of Max More's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outline, and I wonder if a war at all is in keeping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with these principles. Are these principles really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of extropian thinking? Were they just Max More's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own interpretation of extropianism, an interpretation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is not necessary to agree with to call onself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an extropian?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just didn't expect such hot tempers on this list. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know nothing, Mike, but am a very peaceful person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just trying to understand, and leaving open-endedness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the sake of a thorough education. Sorry it was so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nebulous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It doesn't seem like defending religion or debunking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it requires anger or insults. It seems anger and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insult actually detracted from the arguments I read,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making the spiritual people (who would often have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone believe they were more peaceful people for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it) very belligerent, and also making the anti-theists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem irrrational, reminiscent of the day I saw a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2-year-old scream at everyone because he had erasers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuck in his ears but couldn't hear anyone who was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to help.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am at a loss after reading Max's list. I am sure it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is of very little consequence overall, but religion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and anti-religion are two things I would like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand better. I can't this way. Both sides in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this war were not only uninformative, but I now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand less than before. So I question extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles in light of the war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I realize I am leaving myself open to being bashed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both sides of the conflict, but there it is. Bash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away, I am tough and won't strike back. It is not my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way.
