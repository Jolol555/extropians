On the idea of taking over a state by democratic means through
<br>
packing it with dedicated libertarians, I retract my earlier
<br>
views and apologize for laughing at the concept.  On further
<br>
reflection the idea has some real merit.  I still worry about
<br>
the size of the possible military response to an actual
<br>
secession though.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; which seeks to get 20,000 libertarian minded people to move to one state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to tip its political balance toward libertarian policies if not outright
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secession. Current top candidates are New Hampshire and Alaska, among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others like Wyoming, etc. Note that the secessionist party in Alaska
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allegedly got 25% of the vote in the last election, and New Hampshire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has elected more libertarian state legistlators (25) in the last ten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years than any other.&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   I have to say Alaska would be the best bet.  620,000 population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not sure whether that includes military personnell.  You'd have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prepared for some shenigans involving absentee voting by all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military personnel who spent a tour in Alaska and declared it their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; home of record to get the resident stipend :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   It's arguably the best state to go it alone, geographically isolated,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plentiful rescources, not sharing a common border with the states is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helpful.  But maybe the most important part is only Hawaii has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better legitimate legal justification for seccession.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Bringing about a statewide referendum on the &quot;4 choices&quot; wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be nearly as difficult to pull off as trying to get a plurality in Wyoming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To say nothing of trying to run an independant country out of New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hampshire.
