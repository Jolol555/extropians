If a person wants to kill a bunch of other people, it's really not that 
<br>
hard. The WTC terrorists could have walked right up into the WTC with a big 
<br>
fat bomb in a suitcase in a wheeled carryall, gotten in an elevator, gotten 
<br>
off on a floor with a common bathroom, and placed it in a bathroom stall, 
<br>
jammed the stall lock and walked away, and ten minutes later, kablooey! You 
<br>
could blow up the building...I suppose...Professional workaholics carry 
<br>
these suitcases on wheels into these skyscrapers every day.  And, in the 
<br>
middle of the day,  you can walk right into the elevators and right into a 
<br>
publicly accessible bathroom.  Can you get enough kablooey stuff into one of 
<br>
those suitcases to take down a power tower?
<br>
<p>Anyway, if you can get enough explosives into a suitcase, the point is that 
<br>
they could have taken out just about all of the power towers in the USA in 
<br>
one day--no suicide needed. THey can still do that (well, now we have the 
<br>
guards checking IDs before people get into elevators, but that won't last 
<br>
that long....)
<br>
<p>As long as you have a bunch of people on the other side of the world, 
<br>
protected by their own culture and countrymen, and they have declared war on 
<br>
the USA, and the USA has defacto open borders, then they can probably take 
<br>
out the business culture in the USA....
<br>
<p>I don't know if that would be all that big a loss, though. I used to believe 
<br>
in the Business Culture, but as a cryonicist, I wonder if I wouldn't stand a 
<br>
better chance of in a cryo-commune, with us making our own LN2....the only 
<br>
problem is, who is gonna develop the nanotech...and make that beautiful 
<br>
future?
