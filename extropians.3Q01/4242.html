<em>&gt; This is a rather prejudiced way to express certain strains in

</em><br>
<p>I consider a reasonable and workable view to be a view that helps further human
<br>
flourishing in the real world (be it the material realm or cyberspace).
<br>
Cybergnosticism has several serious problems:
<br>
<p>Psychologically, it is not a positive approach to something but rather an
<br>
escape from something. Such avoidance philosophies are not very good
<br>
motivators, especially when they turn away from the messy real world as it is
<br>
today and do not look much for the road from here to the putative utopia.  As
<br>
cybergnosticism is expressed among transhumanism it is almost always in the
<br>
form of speculations rather than practical proposals, not even discussions
<br>
about uploading technologies based on theoretical applied science. Instead it
<br>
tends to produce long discussions of the benefits and transcendence of an
<br>
uploaded state, which rather conveniently ignore all the practical aspects of
<br>
being uploaded. Somebody has to pay the electricity bill even when you are an
<br>
upload. 
<br>
<p>Whether we consider the material world good or bad is in the end a subjective
<br>
evaluation. But a mind that rejects the material world is likely to find that
<br>
whatever experiences awaits beyond uploading will have similarities to those of
<br>
the material world. They will hence be tainted by their hint of materiality and
<br>
the cybergnostic will seek ever larger distance between themselves and the old
<br>
reality. What should be important is the practical benefits of uploading and
<br>
similar stuff, not the assumed ethical/aesthetic primacy of one form of
<br>
experienced reality over another.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Brain/minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the current level are relatively inefficient and bound up by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary patterns that make them rather biased, although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;impure&quot; is going too far.  If mind can be captured and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transferred from brain to upload &quot;brain&quot; in software and perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downloaded into various vehicles then there is a degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support for a sort of mind/body dualism. 
</em><br>
<p>Sure, it would be far more like the classical dualism where souls and bodies
<br>
were like lego pieces that could be put together, separated and perhaps moved
<br>
around. Very much like &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;.  But in most dualism the soul is
<br>
assumed to be able to exist without a body. This is something not allowed for
<br>
by uploading - information always has to be embodied as a pattern in something.
<br>
<p>That an uploaded existence would be practical in many ways and look like a
<br>
dualist universe (although from the inside of the virtual world it wouldn't,
<br>
since the underlying hardware would be hidden by several abstraction levels)
<br>
doesn't mean that the cybergnostic condemnation of the material becomes more
<br>
right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is too early to assume that such an emulation will be always  a part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being an upload.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Always&quot; is a long time. But I prefer to refrain from speculate about magical
<br>
(cognitive) technology that can somehow unravel a mind and reform it (without
<br>
any loss of perceived identity) into an entity that does not act through
<br>
humanoid input/output channels. The brain evolved as a sensory and motor
<br>
integration system, and that underlying function is deeply etched into its
<br>
structure. 
<br>
<p>In the long run we will likely move beyond this, but I would want you to
<br>
consider how much of our anatomy is still based on our underwater origins
<br>
hundreds of millions of years after leaving the sea. Even with deliberate
<br>
redesign it is hard to get rid of basic structures. At the same time, even if
<br>
basic patterns were once used for function A they can later be used for
<br>
functions B and C - the basal ganglia were once just motor control systems, but
<br>
are now involved in planning and deduction, it seems. Tomorrow their
<br>
&quot;descendants&quot; might be wired to simulation engines and instead be used to
<br>
select futures directly - same basic structure, extended functions. But the
<br>
basic structure can also induce affordances and limitations that are not
<br>
possible to remove.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I think transhumanism needs a good perspective of embodiment to avoid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; becoming dualist or cybergnostic. It is easy to say that one wants to change 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one's body, but implicit in that statement is the assumption that the change 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will not change oneself. This is not true; any change of the body is a change 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of oneself. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see why avoidance of mere labels adds anything at all of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value.  If the mind is separable from the body you immediately 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a form of real dualism. If we can in fact function as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent beings in a vastly expanded capacity once thus 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separated from our original bodies (uploaded) then a form of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is prejudicially labelled cybergnosticism in fact makes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense and is seemingly inevitable.  Value judgements of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-upload state as being &quot;impure&quot; are of course not necessary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either.
</em><br>
<p>And that is really the point! I have no problems at all with thinking
<br>
of an existence as a liquid entity online, where aspects of existence
<br>
can be handled by many different substrates. But my problem starts
<br>
when people start to denigrate the material world, the embodied self
<br>
and project what is essentially a mystic vision onto the technological
<br>
future. That form of thinking seriously hurts both the credibility of
<br>
transhumanism in the public sphere and practical attempts to achieve
<br>
goals in the real world. 
<br>
<p>As for whether it is just a matter of labels if I change my body or if
<br>
I change myself, I would suggest considering the following example:
<br>
suppose you cut yourself deliberately. If you think that you cut your
<br>
body, then this act is to some extent divorced from you: the essential
<br>
you has not been affected, and the effects of the act are merely input
<br>
and conditions for you to perceive and handle. That it was deliberate
<br>
was merely like any other act of deliberate harm against your own
<br>
possessions. If you think you have cut yourself, then you also take
<br>
into account that this act has a far deeper importance for you than
<br>
cutting (say) your clothing. It is not just a change in your situation,
<br>
but also an act that has changed what it means to be yourself
<br>
(slightly). 
<br>
<p>I have always disliked exercising, until I realized that it was not a
<br>
struggle between me and my body, but rather that it was about what kind
<br>
of person I wanted to be. Getting more into shape means more than
<br>
improving the cardiovascular system and muscle mass, it means also
<br>
shaping your habits and self-image.
