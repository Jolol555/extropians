<p>&nbsp;
<br>
There *was* non-black slavery.  Just because you (and many others) aren't
<br>
aware of it doesn't mean that it didn't happen.  Now, this *can* be
<br>
attributed to the myopia of a rather English view of New World history that
<br>
conveniently forgets what the French, Portugese, a few others, and
<br>
especially the Spanish were here for a very long time, right up to the end
<br>
of the 19th century.
<br>
<p>For example, there was a long period of time where the Spanish sold slaves
<br>
in New Orleans and other places along the Gulf Coast that were being brought
<br>
in from Spanish controlled territories.  The slaves traded by the Spanish
<br>
were not of African descent in many cases, but local to the territories they
<br>
controlled.  While the documentation for Spanish slave trading activities is
<br>
poor in this regard, it *is* documented (in ships manifests and similar),
<br>
for example, that many thousands of Filipino men and other Polynesians were
<br>
sold into slavery in the deep south through those ports.
<br>
<p>I took a a couple semesters of classes to meet some undergrad history
<br>
requirements at the university that focused on the Asian history in the
<br>
early Americas, and I have to say, it was pretty eye opening.  I learned
<br>
many things that I probably wouldn¹t have learned in &quot;standard&quot; pre-20th
<br>
century history classes on the USA.  There was most certainly an Asian slave
<br>
trade into the Americas.  The reason you don't hear about it is two-fold.
<br>
First, it was much smaller than the African slave trade.  Second, it was
<br>
done by parties other than the British or the French, so it isn't likely to
<br>
be included in a standard perspective of American history.  And to top it
<br>
off, most of the non-African slave trade did not come through ports that
<br>
were owned by the then fledgling British colonies or the early United
<br>
States, so it usually exists outside the purview of &quot;early American
<br>
history&quot;.
