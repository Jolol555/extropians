This isn't true either.  (Well, the common sense part might be.)  
<br>
But ten extra IQ points would make a significant difference.  
<br>
People would be much more prone to argue.  People would create 
<br>
wilder theories to explain what was happening.  Certain classes of 
<br>
problems would tend to be solved quicker.  As a side effect, 
<br>
certain classes of problems would tend to be even more ignored than 
<br>
they are now.
<br>
<p>So things would be different.  And they would change, in certain 
<br>
ways, even more quickly.  Whether they would be any better ...  
<br>
Well, perhaps not.  OTOH, I do think that there is a tendency for 
<br>
those with higher IQs to average less violent (this is also true 
<br>
for those with markely lower IQs, however, so perhaps its an effect 
<br>
of being a social outlier).
