</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; due to demographic change, we'll all have a chance at being in

<em>&gt; &gt; a minority and can be distinguished by our group identity as

<em>&gt; This doesn't make any sense to me.  My problem with most of

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, it doesn't apply to you, then, if you don't so strongly
<br>
identify with being a woman, or a lesbian, or whatever, to the
<br>
point that it suppresses your own unique individuality.  I'll
<br>
grant that most of those who do not appreciate diversity will
<br>
see you first as a whatever---but, sad to say, most of those
<br>
who *do* appreciate diversity will also see you first as a
<br>
whatever.
<br>
<p>And the more difficult question is:  to what degree do you feel 
<br>
more comfortable with others who are women and lesbians (not
<br>
redundant, it turns out)?  Here is the horror:  you *do* have
<br>
more in common with them and so *must* have *some* comfort
<br>
derived from that.  There is the fiendish &quot;reverberant doubt&quot;,
<br>
a notion derived from what Hofstadter wrote about some game
<br>
theory tableux:  when not with a woman or a lesbian, you have
<br>
to wonder, &quot;does this person see me as different and perhaps
<br>
cannot help but doing so and is perhaps asking him/herself
<br>
&quot;does this person see me as different and perhaps cannot help
<br>
but doing so and is perhaps asking him/herself &quot;does this person...
<br>
<p>At times the divisiveness brought about by membership in groups
<br>
seems so inescapable, that, since these &quot;wonderful differences&quot;
<br>
so glorified by the preachers of diversity are intrinsically
<br>
unimportant and pointless to begin with, perhaps we should
<br>
all separate into our own little groups.  Then we just wouldn't
<br>
have to have anything to do with each other, except in a celebrated
<br>
formal capacity (the way that foreigners are treated in Japan), and
<br>
could escape these frictions, and &quot;reverberant doubt&quot;.  Even better
<br>
would be if we all had total freedom to choose our race and gender,
<br>
and could default to &quot;mongrel&quot;.
<br>
<p>Of course, the world is becoming a place where it doesn't matter,
<br>
as you start to say here:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is no longer a world where separatism and xenophobia are very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workable.  So, to some degree, we need to get over it while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserving our ability to be as different as we are and as like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as we are.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that seems correct to me.  Wish us all luck, because we
<br>
are going to need it, pace Singularity.
