<em>&gt; How about nanotechnology engineers?
</em><br>
<p>This is a very interesting document, and not just from the tale of the
<br>
engineers who went down with the ship.  It shows how earlier ships built
<br>
were enormously defended-in-depth, and how safety standards eroded over
<br>
time, until finally the Titanic was built with an unanticipated failure
<br>
mode in which the flooding of one bulkhead lowered the ship to the point
<br>
where another bulkhead could be flooded.  Earlier ships such as the Great
<br>
Eastern, defended in depth by double hulls and other powerful features,
<br>
suffered far worse disasters without even coming close to sinking.
<br>
<p>The most interesting analogy, from my perspective, is of course to
<br>
Friendly AI, though there are suggestive parallels to nanotechnology as
<br>
well.  It suggests that initially, when the engineers make a large
<br>
improvement, they get enough slack to load on their favorite safety
<br>
features; eventually, as the technology spreads and small marginal costs
<br>
become the dominant factor in competition, the safety features disappear. 
<br>
The implication would be that the initial nanotechnology will have all of
<br>
Foresight's suggested safety features and will work; later, over time,
<br>
safety standards will erode.  The same would probably hold true of
<br>
Friendly AI, if not for the Singularity factor.  One is tempted to make
<br>
the analogy between &quot;Creating Friendly AI&quot; and the Great Eastern, but with
<br>
a Singularity occurring immediately thereafter, obviating the opportunity
<br>
for a Titanic fifty years later.
