<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; A public school system CAN be economically efficient if it is subject to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the same competetive pressures of the free market, and if all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people are given their freedom to choose (why is it left wingers seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think we should have freedom of choice in some things, but not in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; others?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Assuming I am understanding what you meant by left wingers and freedom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice) Mike, do you understand the difference between, say, a local police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; department and a local branch of the KKK?  A police sergeant may belong to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the KKK group (there's the freedom of choice), but he cannot represent the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police department while speaking for the KKK group (i.e., he cannot wear his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police uniform, thereby giving the impression that the police department
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supports the KKK, although the police sergeant, as an individual, can be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; member).
</em><br>
<p>Once again, the whiny liberal descends into thinly disguised
<br>
implications of racism...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A democracy may support the right of groups like the KKK to exist, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local, state and federal governments cannot ask taxpayers to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parochialism of the kind the KKK represents.
</em><br>
<p>That is correct. But the state cannot prohibit people from spending
<br>
THEIR OWN DAMN MONEY however they see fit, on KKK rallies or KKK
<br>
schools, ComIntern rallies or Red Youth Reeducation Kamps.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the same vein, private schools may exist in a host of flavors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (specializing in upper-middle class college prep, or employ a creationist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curriculum, or have a foreign language emphasis, or be exclusive for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myriad reasons), but governments cannot ask taxpayers to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parochialism, so public schools are necessarily set at &quot;neutral,&quot; and open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to all citizens (and even non-citizens) of the United States.
</em><br>
<p>That is correct. However, forcing people to pay for things they do not
<br>
believe in is fascism. 
<br>
<p>The problem with your argument is that by your implications, you
<br>
automajically paint all private schools as nests of fascism and racists,
<br>
another thinly disguised left wing debating tactic...
