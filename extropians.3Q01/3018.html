<p><em>&gt;Assuming the above figures are correct, If I were to accept Barbara's

</em><br>
<p>Because the figures only reflect numbers of people sent to jail. There are 
<br>
a couple of reasons why this is not a good indicator of overall criminal 
<br>
bent. The main one is that most white-collar criminals are never caught and 
<br>
imprisoned. Another problem with the figures is that they really indicate 
<br>
that poor people are sent to jail more than rich people. If the races were 
<br>
reversed in position of wealth you would find more whites in jail than 
<br>
blacks. There is plenty of evidence to show that the racial structure of 
<br>
poverty is the result of racism, not a result of any inherent inferiority 
<br>
or superiority.
<br>
<p>I am disappointed that a racist thread has turned up on the extropians 
<br>
list. The denials of racism by some of the (plonked) individuals here 
<br>
remind me of a statement by someone I knew years ago: &quot;I'm not racist. I 
<br>
can't help that blacks are stupid.&quot; I was astonished, but no amount of 
<br>
explanation could convince him of the absurdity of what he said.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
