</em><br>
<p>No objection from me. But even if you get your propulsion from gravity,
<br>
you still have to keep the craft away from touching the vacuum tube. So
<br>
why not use mag lev for that purpose and for propulsion as well? If you
<br>
can get it up to V1, orbital velocity, the passengers will experience
<br>
weightlessness. On the way to that speed I suppose the g forces will be
<br>
formidable. As somebody said it could be practical on the Moon. In that
<br>
case I guess you could also use mag lev to launch space craft from the
<br>
Moon. Arthur C Clark had a technical paper along those line from the 50's-
<br>
a space catapult for the Moon.
