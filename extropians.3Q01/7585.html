<p>Entangled clouds raise hope of teleportation

Clouds of trillions of atoms have for the first time been linked by quantum 
<br>
&quot;entanglement&quot; - that spooky, almost telepathic link between distant 
<br>
particles. The feat opens new possibilities for quantum communication systems 
<br>
and sci-fi-style teleporting of objects from one place to another.
<br>
<p>The everyday view of atoms is of solid, independent objects a bit like 
<br>
billiard balls. But according to quantum theory, atoms are far less concrete 
<br>
entities.
<br>
<p>Atoms can be persuaded to interact with each other so that events affecting 
<br>
one instantly affect another - no matter how far apart they are. Dubbed 
<br>
entanglement, this could open the way to superfast quantum communications 
<br>
systems and ways of teleporting objects by instantly transferring their 
<br>
properties from place to place.
<br>
<p>Before now scientists only managed to entangle a few atoms close together, 
<br>
raising a question mark over the practicality of quantum technology. But now 
<br>
a team at the University of Aarhus in Denmark has entangled two clouds of 
<br>
trillions of caesium atoms. The method should work for very distant clouds. 
<br>
<p><p>Quantum loophole 
<br>
<p><p>The team co-ordinated the quantum states of two atom clouds by exploiting a 
<br>
loophole in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The principle forbids precise 
<br>
knowledge of the quantum state of each gas cloud. 
<br>
<p>But when two clouds are in an entangled state, you can work out the overall 
<br>
properties of the two collections, for example, the so-called total spin 
<br>
state. Changes in one cloud are mirrored by changes in the other that keep 
<br>
the overall property of both clouds constant.
<br>
<p>To preserve the frail entanglement, the team shielded the atom clouds from 
<br>
outside disturbances. They did this using special magnetic fields to trap the 
<br>
atoms inside two vessels lined with paraffin wax.
<br>
<p>By shining laser light through the vessels, the team entangled the spin 
<br>
states of the two atom clouds then watched how long the state lasted. Full 
<br>
entanglement would have lasted only a million-billionth of a second, but the 
<br>
team kept up partial entanglement for half a millisecond - aeons by quantum 
<br>
standards.
<br>
<p>&quot;The experiment shows that it is possible to create entanglement with 
<br>
macroscopic objects, and to do it using just laser light - which means one 
<br>
can do it even when the objects are separated by substantial distances,&quot; says 
<br>
the team leader, Eugene Polzik. &quot;We've also shown that the state can persist 
<br>
for a long time, even at room temperature.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Now that the experiment has been done, it should be relatively simple to 
<br>
entangle more than two atomic samples, or to teleport states of atomic 
<br>
samples,&quot; says Ignacio Cirac, a physicist at the University of Innsbruck in 
<br>
Austria.
