</em><br>
<em>&gt; I consider myself a libertarian.  I do not believe there is a true

and
<br>

attempts to

</em><br>
These are
<br>
<em>&gt; not libertarian or extropian views.  There seems to be an attempt to
</em><br>
link
<br>
<em>&gt; these views, but I don't know why or why now.
</em><br>
<p>Two reasons:
<br>
a) liberals tar libertarians as racists because libertarianism, polls
<br>
show, appeals to a large number of their voting blocks. By labeling
<br>
libertarianism as racist, it helps alienate generally democrat voters
<br>
from libertarian points of view..
<br>
b) actual racists seek to 'mainstream' their message by diluting it with
<br>
various other political views. Actual racists fall under the
<br>
'authoritarian' area of the Nolan Chart, and are thus actually directly
<br>
opposed to actual libertarianism, and have more in common with socialism
<br>
and communism. The reason why they attempt this outreach is because
<br>
Libertarianism is a group that is marginalized but appeals to many
<br>
people who are disaffected by the current duopoly. By coopting some
<br>
libertarian themes (just as many Democrats and Republicans do) they seek
<br>
to draw more people in and lessen their perceived extremism.
