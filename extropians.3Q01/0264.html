<em>&gt; Lee, I couldn't have said it better.  This seems
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-intellectualism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or rather an anti-technology feeling, perhaps having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something to do with the conflict in Vietnam.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have pondered this and welcome any comments on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topic.  Recall the protest movement at Kent State U
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the shootings, etc.  Along with the reviled ROTCs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering students were treated with distrust, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them had short hair and tended to lean to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right.
</em><br>
<p>I was growing up in Toledo at the time, and had
<br>
friends among both the protesters and the intellectual
<br>
groups who didn't have time for protest. Generally, it
<br>
seemed that anything that had to do with the
<br>
&quot;establishment&quot;, including intellectualism, was
<br>
anti-freedom and elitist as well as pro-war. So if one
<br>
would oppose the war and be &quot;in&quot; with the protesters,
<br>
one had better not be among the intellectuals. One had
<br>
better be simply a militant of another kind. I am sure
<br>
there were gray areas in this, but I said I was
<br>
speaking generally.
<br>
<p>I did not like &quot;belonging&quot; to either group because it
<br>
excluded the other. Sometimes there was as much war
<br>
going on here as in the little country of cute yellow
<br>
people.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think part of the resentment towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; techies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the early 70s may have been misguided luddite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notions.
</em><br>
<p>I couldn't agree more. Those who harbored the
<br>
resentment also heard things at home like, &quot;computers
<br>
will take away jobs from humans and take over the
<br>
world&quot; and other reactionary BS, so it had the backing
<br>
of the previous generation to some degree. Although
<br>
they meant well for all humanity, the misguided ones
<br>
were too closed-minded to really have a global view of
<br>
anything.
