A dark day for the planet, one which i feel will drag on for a long time. 
<br>
Make no mistake
<br>
the situation which i see developing from these events is going to be very 
<br>
nasty on both sides.
<br>
Already US officials are talking of full blooded retaliation and &quot;Acts of 
<br>
war&quot; ( something i
<br>
thought was only possible between Nation States  ) reports are coming in of 
<br>
explosions in
<br>
Afghanistan.( which like many other reports around this incident remain to 
<br>
be verified and attributed )
<br>
Retaliation of course will make much of the population of the US feel good. 
<br>
But will guarantee yet another
<br>
cycle of internecine conflict. Unfortunately i cannot envisage the current 
<br>
administration, considering
<br>
the mood of the US population, taking any other course of action.
<br>
<p>But where did all this come from, lets be frank. Acts like this do not 
<br>
spring up in isolation.
<br>
Many years of nee-jerk support of Israel's warts and all policies in the 
<br>
region, combined with
<br>
pointless willingness to be confrontational with Middle Eastern nations. 
<br>
Has resulted in the USA
<br>
<p>These of course are not the only contributory factors, they are however the 
<br>
ones that IMHO most US
<br>
citizens will choose to ignore. Which is almost certain recipe for another 
<br>
full cycle of violent retribution
<br>
on both sadly misguided sides.being regarded as International enemy #2 in 
<br>
the eyes of much of the Muslim world.
<br>
<p>Add to this mix Muslim nations with a suspicious attitude to US motives. 
<br>
Religions and cultures that
<br>
find much of the others distasteful or repugnant. Many pockets of Muslim 
<br>
poverty, ignorance and
<br>
strict adherence to a perceived fundamentalists credo. And a sense amongst 
<br>
many Muslims that the West
<br>
and the US in particular would never support one of their causes no matter 
<br>
how just.
<br>
<p>Please don't for one second imagine that i am in any way justifying actions 
<br>
such as the ones
<br>
committed today. My own dear sister was probably saved, only by the fact 
<br>
that rather than working
<br>
in one of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's WTC offices, she now works in the 
<br>
Braodway offices.
<br>
However i do feel that ignoring the elements that have help to shape the 
<br>
perspectives of the ( suspected )
<br>
perpetrators, is not the best way to sech a long lasting solution.
<br>
<p>Humans are rather nasty violent primates, with huge propensity for ignoring 
<br>
the suffering of &quot;others&quot;
<br>
this i know from experience, but we have to change at some point.
<br>

<br>
<p><p>&quot;FURIOUS GREEN DREAMS, LAY SLEEPING IN STATE,
<br>
BUT SOON THE GREAT JELLY SHALL RISE FROM THE
<br>
DEPTHS,
<br>
AND ALL THOSE WHO MOCKED SHALL KNOW THEIR FATE
<br>
IS SEALED&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guru Zeb,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hacienda,
<br>
