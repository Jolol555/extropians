[optimism on longevity tech curve snipped]
<br>
<p>--&gt; Brian Atkins
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I really don't see this; really, really not. It just doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sound plausible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be so absolute about this; it begins to seem like an issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of faith in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology, in everything working out ok. Consider even just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the trial and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; error is-this-working timescales...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Anyone want to roll out some numerical- and factual- based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments on one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; side or the other?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well for starters what do you think of the Singularity concept and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hard data and graphs Kurzweilai.net has?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P.S. Did you see that news I posted about sequencing your whole DNA in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about 2 hours? What's interesting is that in many cases recently we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to be actually exceeding the Kurzweil graph predictions. So I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider them to be conservative.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I did. This is an advance in speed of obtaining raw data, not speed of
<br>
processing it. I'm not sure it belongs in those particular arguments of
<br>
progress...but that may just be semantics.
<br>
<p>[Now the idea of a certain few people I can think of being passed in
<br>
entirety at high speed through a single nanopore...;) ]
<br>
<p>For me, this whole business is all cold and calculating risk analysis. Any
<br>
and all risk associated with my ceasing to exist is unacceptable risk.
<br>
Unknowns are risk. Therefore the only logical conclusion is to do all I can
<br>
to reduce that risk.
<br>
<p>Insofar as the Kurzweil analysis of the problem goes, what are the
<br>
statistics on futurists -- even damn smart futurists doing the analysis in a
<br>
serious, thoughtful way -- being correct in their predictions? That is to
<br>
say; a) correct in the time sense, and b) correct in the technology sense.
<br>
<p>Now I realise that broad enough predictions are fairly safe (very, very
<br>
broad predictions, like &quot;we will have a channel tunnel one day&quot;, or
<br>
&quot;everyone will be able to talk to everyone with little effort within 20
<br>
years&quot;). However, &quot;aging being defeated soon enough for us not to die&quot; is a
<br>
pretty specific prediction in time and technology. I, for one, look at the
<br>
past performance of such predictions and worry. A lot. Nothing fundamental
<br>
in the art of making predictions of human societal achievement is different
<br>
from 100 years ago. This is enormous risk, right there.
<br>
<p>So; either I sit back and accept the risk, or I get out there and reduce my
<br>
risk. This is a no-brainer; it should be for everyone who doesn't believe in
<br>
resurrection and pattern identity. Just because you think an analysis of the
<br>
singularity in time and technology is good, doesn't mean that you should
<br>
discard an appreciation of just how risky such an analysis is.
<br>
<p>[My take on the analysis? If you want to take the axioms as a given, it's
<br>
fine. However, I don't think it has much real-world application. We're not
<br>
very good at modelling societies at all -- we can barely model stock charts,
<br>
the most simplistic societal output of all].
