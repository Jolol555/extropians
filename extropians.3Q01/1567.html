<p>In this case, the Russian was on US soil when the arrest was made.
<br>
Defense against that: don't visit a country if you object to its laws.
<br>
<p>That said, I have heard of incidents of one country (especially the US,
<br>
though I may have just heard more about that since I live there)
<br>
imposing its laws on other countries with some success.  (For instance,
<br>
certain Europeans arrested for violating copyrights of US companies,
<br>
even though said &quot;violations&quot; were not violations under the eyes of
<br>
their local law.)  Certainly, some of the more poorly thought out
<br>
&quot;cyber-law&quot; treaties, seeking to impose some special regime or legal
<br>
understanding upon the Internet, would bring such under all but the
<br>
most conservative readings of their words (and unfortunately, their
<br>
authors tend to be systematically blind to non-conservative readings,
<br>
only acknowledging any other kind under major pressure from the
<br>
citizens they claim to represent).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What can be done to stop this madness?  No one is safe if this
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the US has come to.
</em><br>
<p>The DMCA is objectionable because it gives the US an excuse to do this
<br>
to anybody on their soil - including their own citizens - and more so
<br>
because, once arrested, anybody can become &quot;lost in the system&quot; without
<br>
due process of law (and there have been occasional documented cases of
<br>
this, usually involving law enforcement officials who believe their job
<br>
is &quot;punish the bad guys&quot; instead of &quot;enforce the law&quot;, one of the main
<br>
differences being &quot;make sure a person really has violated the law
<br>
before inflicting punishment&quot;).  Imposing US law on a person on US soil
<br>
is not, IMO, a problem.
<br>
<p>That said...I remember at Extro 5, there was some discussion about a
<br>
possible &quot;refuge&quot; from this kind of broken system, once space access
<br>
has become affordable enough that there is once again some place
<br>
literally beyond the reach of the law.  I've been musing about this in
<br>
idle moments, and I've come up with a couple questions:
<br>
<p>How would the laws of such a place work?  Presumably, it would be
<br>
modelled on the best working examples we have to date (US and others);
<br>
a constitution that is difficult to change would seem to be the
<br>
starting point.  But how could one shape this constitution so as to
<br>
keep the offices and powers it allows from degenerating due to
<br>
corruption (barring, of course, changes to the constitution, which the
<br>
document itself can not completely guard against without also
<br>
preventing corrections to any legitimate errors in the initial
<br>
version)?  One starting point might be to explicitly state the right of
<br>
any citizen to fair and quick (immediate?) compensation from the
<br>
government for any seizure of resources (physical property, time, et
<br>
cetera); this would give, for instance, incentive to make sure that tax
<br>
forms are easy to fill out (and probably as automated as possible) lest
<br>
the compensation for an average citizens' time to fill out tax forms
<br>
exceed an average citizen's tax bill.
<br>
<p>Assuming the laws have been worked out to a reasonable enough degree,
<br>
how do we get the people and institutions we wish to protect to move to
<br>
the refuge?  This is, IMO, more of an economic question than an
<br>
ideological one: people will move if they believe it is significantly
<br>
profitable for them to do so (with costs including any &quot;psychic costs&quot;
<br>
like moving out of neighborhoods they have friends in), although the
<br>
ideology can influence the economics (it is more profitable to do
<br>
business in an area where those who do your line of work are not the
<br>
target of constant protests, arbitrary law enforcement, and/or - in
<br>
extreme cases - assassination attempts).
