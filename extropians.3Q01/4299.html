<p><em>&gt; Just a few data points.

hybrid scramjet/hydrogen/LOX propulsion unit go orbital?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; doubling takes half the time of the previous one, then in March 2004 the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curve goes vertical.
</em><br>
<p>That's some interesting algebra you're using here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) Yesterday in the news there was released an announcement of a 2GHz
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chip from a company that I had never heard of.
</em><br>
<p>Them multiple gigahertzen is sure nice, but what's the memory optimum vs.
<br>
pessimum of that puppy?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) I'm told that for not too much one can fit a modern PC with a board
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that supports 8 way processing.
</em><br>
<p>Given that sentient stuff will be memory bandwidth starved, I don't see
<br>
how sticking more processors onto a single bus helps the issue. If
<br>
anything, one would want to farm hybrid good OPS/Watt ARM/DSP cores with
<br>
embedded memory, and packet-switched ultrafast serial networks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4) This morning I read in an old InfoWorld (2 weeks ago?) that IEEE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1594b products will be released this fall, and that one implementation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of it (using fiber optic cables) permits a 3.2 Gb (that's bit)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connection over distances of 100 M.  These are expected to be boards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can be fitted into an ordinary PC.
</em><br>
<p>Not so ordinary, given that even a single GBit NIC is going to choke your
<br>
32 bit PCI bus, requiring 64 bit buses. It would be sure nice to be able
<br>
to cluster motherboards directly, using HyperTransport.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5) Beowulf clustering is now becoming common.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but what is the next step after that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 6) I think it was in C Friendly AI that the projection was made that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimum system needed by a seed AI would be 32 processors running at 2 GHz.
</em><br>
<p>Why not 42 processors? Or 420, or 2783144711?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 7) So by the end of the year it should be possible to put together a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system about twice the minimum strength for around $10,000.
</em><br>
<p>Would make for a nice distributed game server.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 8) So by the early part of next year it should be possible to put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together a rack-mount system containing 64 1U boxes linked with cheap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hot-pluggagle connectors that are interlinked at high speed (ehternet or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IEEE 1594b, depending on what's available) with each node at least a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2GHz cpu (though the rack mount system would drive the price up a bit).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   That fits in a one wide rack.  For less than, O, $20,000.
</em><br>
<p>Suggestion: use Myrinet (or channel bonded FastEthernet, HP switches),
<br>
off-shelf (maybe dual) Athlon DDR CL2 boxes, cheap metal shelves, and
<br>
invest the rest into a really good airconditioning unit (unless you live
<br>
in colder climes, where you can just open a window, assuming you're
<br>
unafraid of enterprising polar bears).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Projection 8 can be done with currently available on the shelf hardware,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except for the cpu speed.  The new stuff just makes it cheaper and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster (and slower, if you need to wait to get it and debug the setup).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 9) These rack mounts could easily be connected with a fast interchange.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Take one computer from each rack and devote it to managing task and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information sharing between and withing racks.  You could fit an awful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of racks along 100M of wall space.  And since they are lined up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along a wall, they'd still all be easy to get into to fix.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As always, software is the sticky point.  Unless someone has some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent code writing software...
</em><br>
<p>Oh yeah, you can clog up very fat pipes with bloated protocols, and
<br>
parsing XML the OO way will make you realize why you invested in so much
<br>
hardware which will become obsolete before the year has grown very old.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 10) The assertion has been made that the more computing power you have,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the easier it is to end up with an AI (though not necessarily a friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one).  So by the middle of next year any reasonably profitable business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be able to put together enough computing power, if it chooses to.
</em><br>
<p>It is definitely easier, though there is a threshold. If the Moon wasn't
<br>
made from green cheese but computronium, it would take a whole lot of hard
<br>
work before it started to look down to Earth as an easy snack.
