<p>Speaking as a member of said organization, it's a cost/benefit decision
<br>
that seems to have different weights for everyone.  For me, the cost
<br>
was practically zero - thanks to my parents, I was already in by the
<br>
time I was old enough to decide if I wished to stay, and further
<br>
membership was a negligible financial cost.  Back during the 'Net
<br>
bubble, I invested some of my excess earnings (which would probably
<br>
have vanished into nothingness by now if I hadn't used them then) into
<br>
a long membership period (either 5 year or life, I forget which).  The
<br>
benefits are minor - for instance, an excuse to host one of their
<br>
events, and a slight authority status in any intellectual debate with
<br>
someone extremely vulnerable to appeals to authority (like, say,
<br>
weak-willed venture capitalists) - but larger than the cost, so I keep
<br>
my membership.
<br>
<p>For most people I have heard from, the benefits are likely to be minor
<br>
and social.  If you go in expecting unceasing, stimulating conversation
<br>
with the world's best intellectuals, prepare to be dissappointed -
<br>
doubly so when (and if) you realize that this *is* their normal
<br>
conversation, despite their intelligence.  It's just a random sample of
<br>
normal people, differentiated from most human beings only by their
<br>
ability to score highly on a certain type of test (which may or may not
<br>
have some correlation with ability to learn stuff quickly, and apply
<br>
any such knowledge already possessed...though not necessarily the
<br>
actual possession of said knowledge).
<br>
<p>It is partly from my observations of Mensa that comes my belief that
<br>
intelligence, even what most people currently regard as &quot;genius&quot; level,
<br>
can be learned by almost anyone (the sole exception being people with
<br>
certain classes of brain trauma at a high enough degree that they are
<br>
usually unable to function in modern society).  Genetics, and thought
<br>
patterns learned as a child, may give some people an edge when they
<br>
reach adulthood, but any ultimate potential difference that invokes is
<br>
far in excess of how good even most &quot;geniuses&quot; really become today.
<br>
<p>Which, in turn, gives hope that a properly written AI may well surpass
<br>
actual human general intelligence levels, and even be able to upgrade
<br>
any uploads...
