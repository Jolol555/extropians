<em>&gt;                       Needed: a new age of enlightenment
</em><br>
<p>This is a great essay, the best thing I've read since the attack.
<br>
<p>There are a couple of things I would disagree with; most importantly,
<br>
the assumption that we are going to win this war, that we will subdue
<br>
those countries that are supporting terrorism.  I don't know that we
<br>
have the will or, frankly, the ability to do so.
<br>
<p>But let's suppose we do.  Then the real lesson of Charlie's essay is,
<br>
what next?  We're running Afghanistan and some of the other countries.
<br>
What do we do with them?
<br>
<p>Here I think we have to look back at history.  Charlie points to the
<br>
example of Japan.  We were able to take a country with no significant
<br>
history of democracy, with rule by a religiously oriented militaristic
<br>
faction, with religiously guided hatred of the West, and turn it into
<br>
a successful democracy.  We were able to do the same thing in Germany
<br>
and Italy and other Axis countries of Europe.
<br>
<p>I'd like to see more analysis of how we succeeded in these countries,
<br>
with some discussion of whether the same principles might be applied in
<br>
the Arab nations.
<br>
<p>One other point that I think some people are missing.  A lot of people,
<br>
myself included, are worried that we are merely going to escalate the
<br>
cycle of violence.  We have been hurt much worse than ever before;
<br>
now we are going to hurt back, but the response may be even more deadly
<br>
attacks against us.
<br>
<p>On reflection, I'm not so sure this is the likeliest outcome.
<br>
Human nature is flexible.  Historically, movements and parties which
<br>
get squashed by larger forces tend to die.  Islamic fanatics may have
<br>
more difficulty recruiting members when they see the U.S. destroying the
<br>
institutions used by the revolutionaries.  People turn away from losers.
<br>
<p>A recent historical example is Khadafi of Libya.  At one time he was
<br>
highly respected in the Arab world, attracting men and money.  The US
<br>
killed some of his family, nearly killed him, and destroyed much of
<br>
his equipment.  He lost credibility and hasn't been a threat since.
<br>
<p>Saddam Hussein represents an example of a different sort.  He was left
<br>
standing after the gulf war and was able to cast that as a victory
<br>
of sorts.  This has allowed him to retain some strength as a leader,
<br>
although the constant battering of American bombs has held him back.
<br>
<p>So if the US can deal a significant blow to the terrorist organizations in
<br>
the Arab world (still IMO a very big &quot;if&quot;), I think it is very possible
<br>
that they will not be able to muster an effective counter response.
<br>
Rather than entering into a cycle of violence, we may be able to put an
<br>
end to the violence as we did with Japan and Germany.
<br>
<p>If we can transform the most violent and repressive Arab countries into
<br>
democracies along the lines Charlie suggests, it would be a tremendous
<br>
gift to the future.  Surely it will be an overwhelmingly difficult job.
<br>
And my guess is that there will be many setbacks along the way.  But
<br>
it is a vision which offers hope.
<br>
<p>Hal
