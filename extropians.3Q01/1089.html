scerir said
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;In Venice on a holiday in 1609, Galileo heard rumors that a Dutch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spectacle-maker had invented a device that made distant objects
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seem near at hand. A patent had been requested, but not yet granted,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the methods were being kept secret, since it was obviously of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tremendous military value for Holland.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Such an instrument would also be valuable to Venice, and Galileo
</em><br>
<em>&gt;determined to attempt to construct his own spyglass. After a frantic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;24 hours (according to Galileo) of experimentation, Galileo, working
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only on instinct and bits of rumors, never having actually *seen* the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Dutch spyglass, had a 3-power telescope. After some refinement,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he brought (August 1609, 21th) a 10-power telescope to Venice
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(San Marco bell-tower) and demonstrated it to a highly impressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Senate (they could see a distant church, at Padua). Galileo's salary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was promptly raised, and he was honored with proclamations.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but when did he make his first astronomical observations with it? It 
<br>
seems to have been a date late in 1609. The important observations of 
<br>
Jupiter were in January 1610 and, yes, he published his conclusions in March 
<br>
1610. Amara pointed out to me offlist that the first observations of Jupiter 
<br>
were 7 January 1610. This is a very important date because these 
<br>
observations were critical in demolishing the body of theory and argument 
<br>
supporting the Ptolemaic model.
<br>
<p>So I'm now inclining towards 7 January as &quot;Galileo Day&quot; or &quot;Science Day&quot;.
<br>
<p>I have no doubt that, whatever *we* think or do to celebrate the 400th 
<br>
anniversary of all this in a few years' time, there will be huge 
<br>
celebrations - major scientific and philosophical conferences, etc. Though 
<br>
Galileo certainly had precursors, these events around the beginning of 1610 
<br>
really crystallised the beginnings of the modern approach to rational 
<br>
inquiry that we call &quot;science&quot;.
