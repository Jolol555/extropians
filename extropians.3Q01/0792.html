<p><em>&gt; About the US expanding [to] places such as the UK and Canada,

</em><br>
<p>So what if an offer was made?  Presumably, it would never be
<br>
made unless a very large number of people in the target country
<br>
concurred.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most Americans (and I apologise in advance to the enlightened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of this list) seem to have a fixation on their country.
</em><br>
<p>Please say what people in what other large countries do not
<br>
seem to have &quot;a fixation&quot; on their country.  China?  Ha!
<br>
India?  (I don't know.)  Russia?  Japan?  Don't be ridiculous.
<br>
Patriotism and cultural pride are the norm, especially in
<br>
large countries, and it's not as pronounced in the U.S. as
<br>
in many other countries that could be mentioned.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most of Europe considers America with a sort of amused fear.  The gung ho 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policies of the US government and selective democracy (NSA anyone), coupled 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the fierce national pride that America tends to exhibit gives the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impression of a six year old child with a bazooka, unpredictable and dangerous. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America is certainly the most powerful nation in the world and many countries 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are, or seek to be allied to the states by none would join.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, so let's imagine (in order of population) just how we'd fare
<br>
if your nations of Europe were the world's sole super-power.  Russia?
<br>
You'd prefer Russia?  Germany?  you'd prefer Germany?  Great Britain?
<br>
Well, they had a go at it the previous century.  You liked that better?
<br>
France?  Can you imagine what life would be like if France was the
<br>
world's only superpower?!  Le Grand Nation would soon make you yearn
<br>
for the good old U.S.
<br>
<p>You may have in the back of your mind what Poul Anderson used to;
<br>
he liked to write stories about the Scandinavians somehow ruling
<br>
Earth.  I have to admit that if somehow Sweden, or Australia, or
<br>
Denmark took over the world---AND CONTINUED TO ACT THE WAY THAT
<br>
THEY DO NOW---then that'd be just fine.  But I wonder if they 
<br>
would.  You know the old saying about power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While America continues it &quot;we rule the world&quot; attitude...
</em><br>
<p>But I am sure that you are intelligent enough (even if not perhaps
<br>
thoughtful enough) to realize that the common people of most
<br>
nations would take pride in their ascendency.  Why, they even
<br>
take pride in their soccer teams, for heaven's sake.
<br>
<p>Could it possibly be a resentment born of envy that's eating
<br>
you?  If so, then you are unlike the vast majority of non-U.S.
<br>
readers of this forum, who despite often being understandably
<br>
annoyed when decisions by a foreign power (the U.S.) have so
<br>
much influence, realize that though the U.S. is far from 
<br>
perfect, things could be much, much worse, if lots of
<br>
other countries were in its position.
