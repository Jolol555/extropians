<br>
<p>And JUST how long did this period last, Joe? It never did. Any
<br>
examination of Yugoslavian history for the last 15 years will find that
<br>
Milosevic was hyping his serbian fascism prior to the breakup of the
<br>
Warsaw Pact, and prior to the breakup of the Yugoslav state with the
<br>
secession of Slovenia and Croatia. You can find in the news archives
<br>
that in the late 1980's, Milosevic made a speech in Kosovo inimating his
<br>
Serbian nationalism, that he would stop the growing influence of
<br>
Albanians in Kosovo.
<br>
<p>Once again, Joe, you are quite wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One way to tell social liberals and social conservatives apart, even when one or both claim to be libertarian, is that the social liberals don't hate/fear the word 'different' and worship the word 'similar'.  In fact, the so-called 'rugged individualist

s' of the Reagan era were among the mosy monochromatic clones I can recall; the real individuals are the ones they despised because of their diversity and multi(ple)culure(alism).
<br>
<p>Once again, you show your true colors, Joe. Demonizing, again, your
<br>
opponents.
