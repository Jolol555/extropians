</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Indeed. This is the main disagreement I had with Greg Burch's excellent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; address at Extro5--it was far too structured by the rhetoric of conflict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and even battle. This *might* turn out eventually to be literally true,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in some instances is already, but I find it a self-defeating choice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; analysis and semiotic tactics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In matters of culture, Damien, I value the opinion of few others as highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as yours.  Thus your comments in this vein have continued to reverberate
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; my mind since I first began discussing my Extro5 talk with you.  On the
</em><br>
one
<br>
<em>&gt; hand, you seem to have a very strong point in criticizing adoption of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rhetoric of conflict, or even an analytical framework that could lead one
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; perception of conflict in this arena.  On the other, I cannot help but be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guided by history in these matters -- as I sought to stress in my talk at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extro5.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The conflict between these two points of view lies behind the three
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different strategies I described in that talk.  The truth is that large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; portions of humanity probably aren't really polarized in their thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about progress in general and the incremental augmentation of the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animal that marks the path to post-humanity.  Thus, appeals to the &quot;middle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ground&quot; is indeed the best strategy for the short term in seeking progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the transhumanist agenda.  And some periods of history evidence the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; success of cultural compromise, or at least the benign neglect of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental cultural contradictions.  Look at the West in the 19th
</em><br>
century:
<br>
<em>&gt; While the scientific world peacefully went about its business, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainstream culture continued to be &quot;religious&quot;, adopting the fruits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science and technology in a fairly peaceful, incremental fashion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But there are other times and places when the fundamental contradictions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between basic ideas and values have come into open  and sometimes bloody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict.  The social and political implications of the Enlightenment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimately could not be glossed over and the convulsions of the American
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; French revolutions and their nationalist sequelae in Germany and elsewhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were the result of the inescapable conflict between the liberal world-view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that of the ancien regime.  Likewise, although the traditional centers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of cultural power in the Chinese world struggled for 100 years to find a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peaceful way to accommodate the ideas and values seeping and then rushing
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; from the West, the Sinitic world was ultimately rocked by violent tectonic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shifts in which hundreds of millions died during a revolutionary struggle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that may well not have ended yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question is this: In which sort of period do we now find ourselves?  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have no love of bloody revolutions -- far from it.  I WANT the transition
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; post-humanity to be a peaceful one in which not only physical violence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoided, but even wherever possible the kinds of cultural cleavages that
</em><br>
do
<br>
<em>&gt; violence to cultural continuity with the best of the past.  But I think we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to be clear-eyed about the real possibility that this may not happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I have to disagree with Damien's claim that the rhetoric of battle or
<br>
conflict is a &quot;self-defeating [note the Broderickian irony in this choice of
<br>
word] choice of analysis and semiotic tactics.&quot; Greg does use a number of
<br>
military metaphors, but these are certainly not extreme. ( I have, for
<br>
example, seen much heavier-handed use in academically respectable journals).
<br>
This is not to say that it might not be a better semiotic tactic to tone
<br>
these metaphors down a bit. I am more puzzled by the claim that this is a
<br>
self-defeating choice of analysis. While I don't agree with all the
<br>
specifics of Greg's analysis, surely it is clear that it cannot be the case
<br>
that the future is both transhumanistic and not transhumanistic. Isn't this
<br>
the point of the conflict rhetoric? It would seem dishonest to suggest that
<br>
there might be some way to make consistent all the view points Greg
<br>
discusses.  To avoid the military metaphors let us say that some view points
<br>
will have to be retrenched, down-sized, or laid-off. While there may be some
<br>
give and take around the edges, I really don't see the possibility of
<br>
reaching some real mid-ground here. In a sense, transhumanism already
<br>
contains a mid-ground in that most transhumanist allow that it is a matter
<br>
of choice whether one does or does not employ technology to remake
<br>
themselves as godlike as possible. Many of those that take the contrary seek
<br>
to prohibit this choice tout court. I don't see how we can avoid a clash of
<br>
ideas here. If Greg's analysis is not correct then what is the correct
<br>
analysis? (Perhaps transhumanist ideas can rule on even numbered days and
<br>
nontranshumanist ideas on odd numbered days ;)). Mark.
