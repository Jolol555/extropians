<p>Lee, I couldn't have said it better.  This seems like the
<br>
biggest change from when I was growing up.  In those
<br>
times there seemed to be an *active* anti-intellectualism,
<br>
or rather an anti-technology feeling, perhaps having
<br>
something to do with the conflict in Vietnam.
<br>
<p>I have pondered this and welcome any comments on the
<br>
topic.  Recall the protest movement at Kent State U with
<br>
the shootings, etc.  Along with the reviled ROTCs, the
<br>
engineering students were treated with distrust, for many
<br>
of them had short hair and tended to lean to the right.
<br>
<p>One of the incidents that led to the National Guard being
<br>
called onto the campus was a fire in an engineering research
<br>
facility.  The research was secret so the protest leaders
<br>
managed to convince the proletariat that what was going
<br>
on in that building was the development of special crystals
<br>
that were surreptiously placed on the clothing of Che Guevara
<br>
to track his movements.  Quote from a broadside:
<br>
<p>&quot;Liquid crystals are extremely sensitive to heat, and are used in
<br>
devices to detect campfires in jungle areas and in some cases
<br>
to detect body heat at long range.  The &quot;sniffer&quot; is currently
<br>
used in Vietnam and a similar device was used in Bolivia to
<br>
track and kill Che Guevara.  A struggle has begun and will
<br>
continue on Kent's campus - the development of liquid
<br>
crystals must be stopped.&quot;
<br>
<p>Fortunately the young radicals were unsuccessful.  If you
<br>
are using a laptop you are looking at the results of that research
<br>
right now.  I think part of the resentment towards techies in
<br>
the early 70s may have been misguided luddite notions.  spike
