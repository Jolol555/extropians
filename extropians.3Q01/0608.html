</em><br>
<p>[Extropian Principles snipped]
<br>
<p>If this is re: debunking religions, the chain of thought appears (to
<br>
me) to be roughly:
<br>
<p>* I believe the EP are good ideals to follow.
<br>
* I believe that a majority of religious powers (not for instance God,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;but people whose influsence derives from religion, like the Pope)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;see the popularity of ideals like the EP as eroding their power.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* I back this belief up with all kinds of evidence from history.
<br>
* I therefore believe that these same religious powers direct their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;followers to hate and do bad things to people who believe ideals like
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the EP.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* I back this belief up with all kinds of evidence from history, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from recent statements and - more importantly - actions by these
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;powers.
<br>
* I therefore believe that my belief in the EP puts me in some danger.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* I believe that we are approaching a point where technology, and the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inevitable consequential understanding of the human condition, will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be so advanced as to render obvious the fallacies in these
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;religious powers' religions, and thus motivate all but a few to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;openly denounce all such religions, thus demolishing their power.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* I believe that they are aware of this oncoming time, therefore I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe that their self interest demands that they do everything
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they can to attack technology and those who back it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* I back this up with their recent statements and actions.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* My belief in the EP makes me a poster child technology promoter,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore the danger to my own life will increase significantly,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;becoming one of the main dangers to such if it is not already.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* (Some of us believe it is nowhere near that dangerous yet, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will not be for many years to come.  The evidence from recent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;events can be argued either way.)
<br>
* I do not wish to be in this type and magnitude of danger.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* Therefore, I wish to take action to get myself out of danger.
<br>
* Among the options that have occurred to me to resolve this problem,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the most appealing is to hasten the demise of these religions through
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;making people no longer believe them, thus largely negating the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;religious powers' influence.
<br>
<p>...which leads to the debate as to how to do such a thing.  Personally,
<br>
my own thought chain offers a different solution: hasten debunking via
<br>
technology, both by exploring how exactly this happens (a good
<br>
understanding of science can already offer much immunity from religious
<br>
memes) and by getting the relevant advanced technolgies into many
<br>
peoples' hands (thus making it easier to obtain said good
<br>
understanding, through frequent interaction with demonstrations of the
<br>
principles - for instance, experiencing memories copied into one's
<br>
brain by purely physical processes, which would not be possible if the
<br>
&quot;soul&quot; which contained such was purely nonphysical).  A person can be
<br>
silenced by a number of means (bullet, court order, inflicted poverty,
<br>
etc.); a widely spread meme is more difficult to displace (which works
<br>
both for and against us).
