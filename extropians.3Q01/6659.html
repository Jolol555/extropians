<p>
Not an altered Koran but a Koran with commentary and
<br>
ideas written by the more reasonable and agreeable Islamic scholars.
<br>
Basically a book which moves people
<br>
closer to truth and good behavior but begins with ideas
<br>
and information they will find interesting and useful.  Such
<br>
a book could be produced and delivered with relatively little expense.  It
<br>
would be acceptable to almost everyone
<br>
and deeply hated by a few.
<br>
<p>I generally will not lie to people (except under extreme
<br>
duress) but I am not above accepting their premises for
<br>
a while and reasoning towards a good solution without
<br>
fighting all of their misconceptions.  Water is always
<br>
true to it's nature but it conforms to containers, rocks,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>I also really like the radio idea.  Relatively inexpensive
<br>
short wave radios, preset to interesting stations in a
<br>
language they understand.  Solar powered, maybe windup, rechargeable
<br>
batteries.  Drop them in with little
<br>
(shinny, light catching) parachutes, have them turned
<br>
on and tuned to an appropriate channel broadcasting
<br>
a good introductory show.  Include ear buds for private
<br>
listening and a speaker for groups.  Pricey idea but cheaper than bombs.  No
<br>
single message but a way to start listening to many ideas. Control freaks
<br>
will hate this idea.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; We have really good printing technology.  We can print and

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; bind books for almost nothing.  How about if we print truckloads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of korae, except each one with one altered verse?  If we get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; clever, we could print a million of them, each with a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; altered verse, bind them with pre-aged covers, so they could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; not be distinguished easily from the originals without reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the entire thing, carefully.  If those get into circulation, print a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; new set with the old altered verse plus an additional altered verse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; In each case these altered verses reverse the meaning of the original.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I figure one cruise missile aimed at scorched and barren desert

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is ludicrous.  Extropians are believers in TRUTH.  Yet every time
</em><br>
we
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have any sort of threat to our ideals, many people on this list start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inventing all sorts of subterfuge and lies.  The archives are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; full of ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on infiltrating groups, committing crimes and blaming them on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone else,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; issuing false statements attributed to someone else, starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; false rumors, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree. You can win with the truth; descent into subterfuge and secrecy
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; very bad. I see this all the time in business; it's the knee-jerk reaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 90% of execs when in conflict with other companies or when something
</em><br>
goes
<br>
<em>&gt; wrong. Must be hardwired into humans somewhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I liked the underlying core of the koran idea, if not them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementation. As a culture (and including technology in this
</em><br>
definition),
<br>
<em>&gt; US core competency is not in fighting wars [rationale: the US doesn't want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to, not that it is technically bad at it]. US core competency is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spreading the US cultural meme package -- you just have to look at China
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; see how we're doing at that with a country where we're really trying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whatever anyone says, US companies and interests are fully engaged and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merged with Chinese companies and interests in my industry (wireless) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many others; there is a great exchange of culture, ideas and technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going on right now.  Chinese and American businesspeople -- the
</em><br>
politicians
<br>
<em>&gt; and influencers and moneymen of tomorrow -- are open and friendly with one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you look at where real non-negotiable problems in the world come from,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they seem to center around isolated countries and regions, those in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the citizens cannot be a part of the global flow of knowledge. So taking
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; book idea, we apply it to an equal mix of : a) educational materials (got
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; make it easy for people who can read to teach those who can't), b) history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and cultural works relevant to the region we're dropping them on, c)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literature from around the world, d) books formed up of translated
</em><br>
newspaper
<br>
<em>&gt; digests from around the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then we get on and drop this stuff on a country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's all sorts of tech solutions too (which is where we get fanciful):
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) drop handhelds and chips instead of books. Use the simputers developed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for India; $200 each, rugged and simple.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) if you're going to invade someplace (which you really shouldn't -- see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point on core competency above), invade it in a small way to set up and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protect small distribution centers surrounding those recently-invented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book-binding devices that can run off books on demand. Propagate the
</em><br>
devices
<br>
<em>&gt; and the books they produce.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; c) hell, radios would work. Lots and lots of them; the wind-up clockwork
</em><br>
<em>&gt; types.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So anyway, back to the points: books are better than bombs. Isolationism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breeds worse terrorists. In a small world, the community can't afford to
</em><br>
let
<br>
<em>&gt; countries damage their own populations by sitting in the corner and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participating. Or forcing them to do the same. Just build a big pipe for
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; exchange of information between cultures, and let the market and human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature do the rest.
