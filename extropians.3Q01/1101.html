<em>&gt; &gt;It's one regularly trotted out by religious

<em>&gt; I have no idea what brought this on, Samantha. Nothing I said in response to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What do you mean &quot;brought this on&quot;?  What this?  I didn't take
<br>
it personally but was intending to simply comment on what seemed
<br>
like dismissing &quot;scientism&quot; to quickly.  Sorry if that got
<br>
obfuscated by the style and tone of my response.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; And, in case you're tempted to retort that cliches usually contain a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;grain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of truth (which I accept), most of us who admire the advancement of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; do *not* treat it as a religion. We favour rational inquiry into nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; through methods such as observation, experiment, mathematical modelling,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; formal logic, hypothetico-deductive reasoning. The conclusions we come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; are provisional. Where the more precise methods of science break down,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; still favour rational techniques such as logic and consilience, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;methods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of philosophy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This is not what is meant by the term &quot;scientism&quot;.  The above is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;mostly simply science.  I don't think &quot;consilience&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;sufficient or well enough known to cover the rest.  Nor is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;philsophy restricted to logic and consilience alone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't say this. I said &quot;such as&quot;. BTW, if my referrence to consilience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments is obscure to anyone (and it does *not* appear to have thrown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha - I'm not saying that), have a look at Michael Ruse's excellent and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very fair book _Can a Darwinian be a Christian_ (Cambridge Univ. Press,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2001), p. 13 where he explains how consilience of inductions is a primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of argument in historical sciences where there is less emphasis on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiments. I'd say that the same applies to philosophy.
</em><br>
<p><p>It may fairly be said that almost all philosophy is filled with
<br>
consilience of inductions.  A lot hinges though on what one
<br>
allows are and are not facts and classes of facts.  Religion and
<br>
spiritual also hinge to a large degree on such consilience. 
<br>
That plus positing another more direct form of perception open
<br>
only to the few or the specially prepared.  Most mature
<br>
religions take some pains to differentate that form of knowing
<br>
of facts from mystical experiences per se.  
<br>
<p>Now it is easy to say that this other thing, revelation, does
<br>
not exist or can be explained away by a combination of unusual
<br>
experiences, strange mental states, wishful thinking,
<br>
subconscious integration, idiot-savant like effects (which we
<br>
don't understand either) and so on.  So we will lay that one to
<br>
one side.  Not because we can prove it is false but because we
<br>
have no means of proving its truth unless we are one of the
<br>
supposedly rare ones and then our knowing is still not
<br>
convincing to others.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think I'd better stop at this point, rather than enter into a line by line
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rebuttal, or I'll escalate the current religion war which, whatever part I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may have played in sparking off, I have consistently tried to calm down.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed, Samantha, I consistently tried to avoid offending you in particular,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowing your views about spirituality etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am not particularly offended and I have appreciated and do
<br>
appreciate your postings on the topic.   
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; However, the aggressive attack on supposed &quot;scientism&quot; by Party of Citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - and the hackneyed claims about a scientistic &quot;religion&quot; - demanded a clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rebuttal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree it requires a rebuttal.  Hopefully such will say what
<br>
*scientism* is and is not.  I do think there is something that
<br>
word does apply fairly to but not of the kind or to the degree
<br>
that P.O.C. alluded to.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Russ who is still prepared to be conciliatory to allies
</em><br>
<p>I am glad to hear it but I was really not offended by you or
<br>
anything you said.
