<p>Does &quot;Hayek's Law&quot; condemn the U.S. to a Japanese-like L-shaped recession?
<br>
<p>Are we in a recession, and if so, what shape will it have--V, U or L? It
<br>
will be six months, or maybe a lot longer, before we know the answers to
<br>
those two questions.
<br>
<p>The official government story is the economy is still expanding. But don't
<br>
put too much faith in that. &quot;When the Bureau of Economic Analysis first
<br>
estimated real gross domestic product growth for the third quarter of 1990,
<br>
it reported a positive number of almost 2%,&quot; says Randell E. Moore, editor
<br>
of Kansas City, Mo.-based Blue Chip Economic Indicators Survey. &quot;It wasn't
<br>
until after the first of the following year that the 1990 third quarter was
<br>
revised to a negative number.&quot; So you can't be reassured by the fact that
<br>
the average forecast of the 50 economists Moore tracks is a slow but
<br>
positive 1.8% real growth in 2001. &quot;The consensus typically doesn't forecast
<br>
recessions,&quot; warns Moore.
<br>
<p>Houses are still being built and cars are selling well. But whole
<br>
industries, including capital goods, advertising and telecom, are in their
<br>
own recession. Layoffs in June totaled 125,000; company after company
<br>
reports billion-dollar losses.
<br>
<p>So let's look on the dark side. If we're about to enter a real recession,
<br>
will it be a V-shaped recession like in 1980? That would mean a quick break
<br>
followed by rapid rebound. Or will it be a U-shaped recession like in
<br>
1981-82, in which the economy stalls and takes a painfully long time to get
<br>
going again? Or will it be an L-shaped one--a crash followed by a protracted
<br>
period of slow-to-no growth? Example: Japan in the 1990s, after the 1984-89
<br>
bubble.
<br>
<p>Jay N. Mueller, economist at Menomonee Falls, Wis.-based Strong Capital
<br>
Management, is an optimist (he still projects 1.5%-to-2.5% growth in 2001)
<br>
who nevertheless worries about several potential causes of L-shaped trouble:
<br>
<p><p>. The low personal savings rate, which sank to -1.3% in early 2001. Capital
<br>
gains financed spending. But now many investors have capital losses.
<br>
<p>. The high tax burden. The combined federal, state and local take was 32.6%
<br>
of GDP in 2000, significantly above the World War II high of 30.8%.
<br>
<p>. The high debt burden. Business debt is 64.4% of GDP, up from 53.4% in
<br>
1994; interest on mortgage and consumer debt now consumes a near-record
<br>
14.3% of disposable income.
<br>
<p>. Excessive business investment.
<br>
<p>This may seem an odd concern. But excessive or misallocated investment
<br>
(&quot;malinvestment&quot;) is at the heart of a business-cycle theory that, at the
<br>
time of the Great Depression, was a serious competitor with Keynesianism.
<br>
Named after the birthplace of its two major proponents, Ludwig von Mises and
<br>
F.A. Hayek, &quot;Austrian Economics&quot; has attracted new attention with the
<br>
discrediting of Keynesianism--and with the unusual characteristics of this
<br>
postboom economy.
<br>
<p>&quot;The world economies have struggled this year in accordance with Hayek's
<br>
Law,&quot; says Mark Skousen, an occasional FORBES contributor and editor of the
<br>
Austrian-oriented financial newsletter Forecasts &amp; Strategies. &quot;Hayek's Law
<br>
states that the economy takes a long time to recover after an unsustainable
<br>
boom (1995-99). The excesses of the previous boom create an investment
<br>
structure that cannot be easily dismantled and transferred to new uses.&quot;
<br>
<p>It's news to modern Austrian economists that Hayek had a law. But they do
<br>
see a point to Skousen's coinage.
<br>
<p>&quot;The expansion of the late 1990s and subsequent downturn are better
<br>
explained by Hayek's theory than by any other business-cycle theory,&quot; says
<br>
Roger W. Garrison, economics professor at Auburn University and an adjunct
<br>
scholar at the independent Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Ala. &quot;The
<br>
artificiality of the boom probably dates to early 1996, when the Federal
<br>
Reserve lowered interest rates even though the unemployment rate was at or
<br>
near its 'natural,' or 'full-employment' level. The misallocations of the
<br>
late 1990s entailed overinvestments in future-oriented and highly
<br>
speculative projects--dot-coms and the like.&quot;
<br>
<p>Garrison also notes that the economy, ominously, seems no longer to be all
<br>
that responsive to Federal Reserve stimulation. &quot;All these features are
<br>
consistent with Hayek's theory,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>Another Mises Institute adjunct, Frank E. Shostak, chief economist for MAN
<br>
Financial Australia in Sydney, Australia, argues that the severity of U.S.
<br>
distortion shows in the record-high ratio of capital-goods investment to
<br>
personal consumption (see chart, below). He predicts &quot;a severe liquidation
<br>
of capital goods production.&quot; Maybe you should short semiconductor-equipment
<br>
manufacturers.
<br>
<p>Depressing? Two more, even nastier, worries from the dark side:
<br>
<p>. The strong U.S. dollar. Continued strength may choke manufactured exports.
<br>
A break, on the other hand, may choke off foreign capital imports, which
<br>
currently finance American government and industry to an unprecedented
<br>
degree.
<br>
<p>. International weakness. Not only is there recession in some key markets,
<br>
like Mexico, but there are also potential crises, as in Argentina and Japan.
<br>
AIG International economist Bernard Connolly has told clients: &quot;The
<br>
conditions seem to be falling into place for a global growth panic over the
<br>
next couple of months.&quot;
<br>
<p>Austrian economists still have a healthy respect for the power of monetary
<br>
policy. Skousen even says he expects some short-term recovery because of Fed
<br>
interest rate cuts. But it will be &quot;an artificial recovery that cannot be
<br>
sustained.&quot;
<br>
<p>So: V, U or L? Distinguished Chicago school economist Milton Friedman, now
<br>
at Stanford's Hoover Institution, thinks it will be a sort of V: &quot;We are in
<br>
a mild recession, and there is a good chance that we will bottom around the
<br>
end of this year and go into a relatively mild expansion.&quot; Under the
<br>
circumstances, that's a somewhat bullish thought.
