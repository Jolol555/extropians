<br>
<p>Racism follows logically from evolution, as it makes all the units of a
<br>
potential new species to support the species. A species needs to wish to
<br>
exist, or it will die out.
<br>
<p>Racism and wish for longevity form the sides of he same coin, one of them
<br>
collectivistic (racism), the other individualistic (wish for longevity).
<br>
<p>I believe one could say the problem lies with collectivism, of which
<br>
racism forms just a small part.
