Each of them protected by a force field and ray guns, to keep the next lot
<br>
of terrorist-hijacked planes at bay.
<br>
<p>And try not to build them over faults this time.
<br>
<p>And never use candles when checking the foam rubber seals.

<p>If only we could tap into the limitless energy source known as, &quot;Damien's sense of sarcastic humor!&quot;  At least Australia could then have their energy needs met!  ; )
<br>
<p>And think Damien, with this new optimism in nuclear power, we will soon see nuclear powered aircraft!  The dream of the 1950's U.S. department of defense!  And hey, why not nuclear powered automobiles!  Heck, we can even have nuclear powered electric toothbrushes!  Talk about a glow in the dark smile!! 
<br>
<p>I have been told the new generation of nuclear power plant is vastly safer then its predecessor.  And this time around we don't have to worry about the dreaded &quot;meltdown&quot; scenario.  I stil am concerned about the waste disposal issue though.  
<br>
<p>I had a slightly heated exchange about the matter at Extro-5 with Kennita Watson(a really cool lady).  She is a militant supporter of the new nuke plant design, and felt my desire for solar and wind power being the answer as being misguided.  
<br>
<p>Personally, I would go for space based solar collectors to solve our power needs, but I really think the cost might bankrupt the nation! lol  Perhaps though, the enterprise might be much cheaper then I think.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
