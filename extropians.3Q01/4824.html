<em>&gt; Happy?
</em><br>
<p>How about antitruck defense? Antishipment defense? Anti UPS defense? If I
<br>
put a nuke on board of my private Cessna with bona fide papers? If I rent
<br>
an apartment in a skyscraper, and arrange the nuke to be delivered there
<br>
disguised as a piece of office furniture?
<br>
<p>If I don't bother with nukes at all, and just go biological, which you
<br>
detect about 3 days after it has been synchronously deployed in tens or
<br>
hundreds of different locations, by virtue of people suddenly starting
<br>
dropping like flies by the millions?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In such a case the rules are completely different.
</em><br>
<p>Of course they're different: you're going to use alternative delivery
<br>
vehicles. I wouldn't risk the 10 nuclear devices I have, I might lose
<br>
several, thus weakening the impact. So I make sure the delivery will be
<br>
accurate, and stealthy, and reliable. In other words, I will use a
<br>
delivery truck.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does not work at the moment.
</em><br>
<p>We've been through this before, the system will intercept only a small
<br>
number of dumb vehicles. It will have trouble to intercept meaningful
<br>
numbers of smart vehicles. It is completely bypassed by other modes of
<br>
delivery. It's 95% a purely political/economical piece.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Explain how a defensive system affects world peace.
</em><br>
<p>I'm Russia, or China, and I just don't know how good your system is. It
<br>
cannot be tested in reality by means other than a full scale attack, so
<br>
I'll just compensate it by developing NEMP weapons as show openers, smart
<br>
vehicles, and MIRVed nukes, lots of them. Modern nukes designes as used by
<br>
superpowers are tiny, cheap and clean.
<br>
<p>As a result, we suddenly have more nukes in circulation. People will be
<br>
getting nervous again. Do you remember how it was growing up, always
<br>
expecting a flash out of clean blue sky? Do we need that again, honestly?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;MAD&quot; equilibrium disappeared with the fall of the USSR, and in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case you weren't aware, China has superpower designs and is going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to build its arsenal accordingly. When China starts refering to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singapore as &quot;The Lost Colonies&quot; you'll understand.
</em><br>
<p>I thought the umbrella was useless against a superpower. China is pretty
<br>
big, and it is growing fast, so it will be there quite soon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I find your analysis faulty, no doubt the pentagon does as well.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't yet heard a single convincing argument for the umbrella. I've
<br>
heard dozens convincing arguments against the umbrella.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that we should make every effort in this regard, however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only an idiot leaves himself/herself defenseless.
</em><br>
<p>Why defenseless? If this is a small attack with ICBMs, you have
<br>
forewarning, and you see them coming, so you just bring the folks in
<br>
target areas underground, and launch a retaliation strike. Passive defense
<br>
against openly deployed WOMDs is very possible, and cost effective.
<br>
<p>Personal sterile seals, bunkers and pathogen aerosol sniffers are not
<br>
sexy, but they sure can be made to work, and will cost you a fraction of
<br>
an umbrella which won't work, and will invite alternative modes of
<br>
delivery which you're utterly defenseless again.
