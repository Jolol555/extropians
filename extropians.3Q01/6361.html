<em>&gt; Quite right. My calls for careful thought and less than horrific end-games
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; now that they be stopped no matter what. Because your life is likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already forfeit, you no longer have anything to lose in such a situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In considering against other countries however, the rules of good sense and
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Agreed. I never meant to imply otherwise.
<br>
<p>And, for what it's worth, my point about vigilantes is that they're _not_
<br>
generally painted as suicidal.
<br>
<p>Making stupid Weltpolitik moves is.
