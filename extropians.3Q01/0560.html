<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Two claims are implicit here; one is that whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; these terms refer to, they ought to be replaced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; terms that do not derive from traditional religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; beliefs.  I find this very persuasive for a variety
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of reasons, chief among them that it would prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; simple miscommunication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What for?  Why should they be replaced unless there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a tacit assumption that religiosity (is this a word and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what precisely is its meaning?) is utterly false.  I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not grant this assumption.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like I say, because they mean so many things to so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different people; communication is impeded.
</em><br>
<p><p>But the terms also deal with things that science does not deal
<br>
with like value systems.  What will you do with those?  If you
<br>
divide out the things you can dispose of and leave the things
<br>
you can't you aren't dealing quite with what spirituality and
<br>
religion deals with. The conversation gets caught in strawman
<br>
positioning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The second claim is that traditional religious beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; are false, and therefore need to be debunked.  Few on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; this list with argue with that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What exactly is meant?  The statement is too broad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I meant belief in gods and spirits (of a more literal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bent).  (Sure, when used metaphorically, like &quot;there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a spirit of happiness at Extro-5&quot;, no claim of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the existence of any kind of literal spirit is implied,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but many traditional religions do believe in spirits.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I believe there exist intelligences in this universe greater
<br>
than our own and that some of them are quite concerned with what
<br>
happens here. No, I can't prove it but it is what I believe.  I
<br>
also believe there is more to reality than what science accounts
<br>
for and is capable of accounting for.  Value questions is one of
<br>
the simplest ones to get a handle on.   At bottom level we don't
<br>
even know just how &quot;material&quot; the universe materialism deals
<br>
with actually is.  I take the notion that mind is only an
<br>
epiphenomenon or outgrowth of certain arrangements of matter to
<br>
be a theory that is strongly suggestive but not a proven fact
<br>
yet.  
<br>
<p>Beyond that I believe that the concept of God and the dynamics
<br>
of religions at their best can empower groups of people to build
<br>
and make real a unifying vision that I don't know how to acheive
<br>
otherwise.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Then why throw this one out?  Pandering?  Do you not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see that we &quot;pander&quot; here all the time to opposite beliefs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Um, no.  Can you describe what we do to opposing beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here all the time?  (&quot;Pander&quot; literally means to gratify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone's weakness or vulgar tastes.  I meant to make an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appearance of agreeing with something we really think to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be wrong---I'm not sure; I may have used the word incorrectly.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If that is what you mean then the first use wasn't consistent. 
<br>
So ok.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; That's one of the reasons that the term is inherently confusing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now among people whose beliefs are very similar, and so where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; little or no confusion is liable to occur, use of the term is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; quite warranted, of course.  But here, where we would like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; determine (I hope) just what substance lies behind use of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; term, I for one want to understand what drives atheists and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; materialists to ever use it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I am neiter an atheist (although I don't believe in a God
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; remotely like many theists do) or a materialist (in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dictionary meaning of the word) so I can't help you.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; why the tacit assumption that only atheists and materialists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; need be consulted to understand if spirituality has value?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry---I thought that you were an atheist and a materialist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps even those words are now suspect.  Still, despite all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the foregoing discussion, you haven't indicated what you mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by &quot;spirituality&quot; or &quot;religiosity&quot;.  Now I *am not* asking for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strict definitions---well have I known since a small child the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; futility of that---I merely would like a couple of examples of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how you might use some phrases (instead of those words) to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the idea across.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't like the word &quot;religiosity&quot;.  That one came from someone
<br>
else.   It seems to have some denigration built into it.  I will
<br>
eventually share some of the actuality of what I do with
<br>
spirituality
<br>
in my life if you wish.  But it is not easy as there has long
<br>
been a tension inside of me between various parts of my
<br>
spirituality and
<br>
science and scientific or perhaps scientistic worldview.  To be
<br>
honest I am afraid of being shunned from conversations I care
<br>
about by people I respect and care about where my views and
<br>
practices are too much at odds with what some may believe is
<br>
reasonable and respectable.  It doesn't feel very safe.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I do not think atheists or materialists are impoverished.  After
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all I spent more than a little time in that position myself.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fully understand it.  It is not my home, not where I find my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; life most rich and fulfilling, but I certainly don't denigrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that position at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neat.  But I still have very little sense at all of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're trying to convey when &quot;spirituality&quot; or &quot;religiousity&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pops up in your sentences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am not very sure I wish to try to convey much of what it is to
<br>
me here.  Partially because my own attempting to find a balance
<br>
that fits is a delicate process.  Partially because I don't feel
<br>
this is a very safe environment for simply sharing much of what
<br>
I deal with outside of more common mutual grounds of
<br>
interaction.  I will have to consider how much I want to say at
<br>
this time and get back to you.
<br>
<p><p>Also, there is the matter of the generality of spirituality vs
<br>
the specifics of my spirituality.  I don't want the generality
<br>
of the question and the issues to be lost in the specifics
<br>
directly relevant to me.
