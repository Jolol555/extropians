<p>What would work is using signatures and well-encrypted

relatively tamper-proof code servlets or agents.

<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Yes MS's Outlook email program is a major problem (though not the only one)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but deciding on whether the item comes from a trusted source is not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution as most recent viruses use MS Outlook to email themselves to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people in the Outlook address book. This means that the most dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attachments can easily come from people you know and trust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes.  The last sender is irrelevant.  Who signed the code
<br>
package and their level of trust and the integrity of the
<br>
package are the key.   Also the package should be executable
<br>
within a sandbox that restricts and flags certain possibly
<br>
dangerous behaviors.  
<br>

<br>

<em>&gt; It is already not terribly difficult to write networking software on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Windows PC without access to raw sockets. As I understand it, raw sockets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give the programmer control over every aspect of the packets they send. At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moment if you want to send, say, a UDP packet then the operating system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes it easy for you to do that; it creates the headers for you and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just give it the data you wish to stick in it. Raw sockets give you the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to forge the headers so that you can make it look like your packet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; came from anywhere, for example from Harvey Newstrom's IP address. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a real worry when they start doing very illegal things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Raw sockets seem irrelevant to the problem.  They are being used
<br>
as a red herring for the purpose of sowing further distrust of
<br>
the underlying layers of the internet.  We are being set up for
<br>
proposals to let MS and others redesign the network &quot;for our own
<br>
good&quot;.  Wait and see.  The kind of wire is irrelevant. 
<br>
Establishing the authenicity and trustwortiness of the packet is
<br>
the crucial point.  Even with raw sockets I could not fake a
<br>
message as being encrypted with your private key.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&lt;snip&gt; We already have this ease of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;network programming on Macintosh, OS/2, Linux and other Operating Systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Only Microsoft had previously tried to block programmers from accessing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;their own PCs.  We haven't seen those other platforms becoming hacker
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;favorites.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MS machines are so insecure that blocking people from raw sockets is a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea. If they became as secure as Linux machines then most of this problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would evaporate. Random programs are not allowed access to raw sockets on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Linux, from what I understand -- they need super-user (root) status. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know enough about the Mac and OS/2 to be able to comment on them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Covering up the wire in proprietary bullshit because the system
<br>
is misdesigned is *not* a good idea.  You do not need root
<br>
permission to do socket programming.  It would be dangerous if
<br>
you did need that kind of permission to do something so
<br>
elementary.  The wire is not important.  It is what is the
<br>
message and what is done to protect its integrity and what is
<br>
done in response to it that we care about.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;There is nothing really new in Microsoft XP that hackers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;don't already have if they wanted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Every XP machine that is open to the net without adequate virus/worm/trojan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protection becomes a potentially untraceable source of Denial Of Service
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flooding via zombies using forged headers. (Read <a href="http://grc.com/dos/">http://grc.com/dos/</a> for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information on why WindowsXP is a special security concern and particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://grc.com/dos/grcdos.htm">http://grc.com/dos/grcdos.htm</a> for a vivid understanding of the zombie danger.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The zombie danger has always been present on all platforms.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&lt;snip&gt; This system [universal ID]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is already in place.  Hackers may be able to work around this system or any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;new system of identification.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK. Burglars can get around any security system. Do you leave your front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; door unlocked or open when you go away on holidays? Why not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Universal ids have the nasty side-affect of making all
<br>
transactions traceable.  Say goodbye to many perhaps cherished
<br>
forms of privacy.  Anonymous ids with reputation based levels of
<br>
trust maintained by well designed and respected trust-broker
<br>
sites could alleviate some of that.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Cringely's call for new protocols, APIs, interfaces and the like are silly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have misread his article. He is actually arguing against new protocols.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He wants us to make better use of what we have now. He makes no suggestions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for new APIs or interfaces.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>He should.  And especially better and more ubiquitious
<br>
encryption and sandboxing of received code.
