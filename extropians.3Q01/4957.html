<p><p><p><em>&gt;These kinds of arguments scare me for what they imply more than what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actually say.
</em><br>
<p>Great post, Harvey. If I went through it line by line, I might not agree
<br>
with all of it.
<br>
<p>Eg.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;When he says you can accept but not celebrate homosexuality without being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;homophobe, he implies that we can accept that it exists but we don't have
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt;like it or even cooperate with it.
</em><br>
<p>Well, look, I am prepared to celebrate homosexuality. I've had people very
<br>
close to me who are homosexual or bisexual. I'm just your standard model
<br>
heterosexual polyamorist.
<br>
<p>However, can I really expect the local Catholic bishop to *like*
<br>
homosexuality or *cooperate* with it? I think not. The point of having a
<br>
liberal society is that people will put up with things they don't like and
<br>
won't cooperate with. Tolerance entails tolerating things you don't like.
<br>
But if we are committed to the classical liberal ideal of society we won't
<br>
try to bring force, in the form of the state's coercive powers, to bear
<br>
against those things we don't like. In that sense, we'll tolerate them.
<br>
Tolerating homosexuality even if we don't like it is more than just
<br>
acknowledging that it exists.
<br>
<p>I can't work out where, exactly, Heston stands on this. However, some of
<br>
your interpretations seem ungenerous.
<br>
<p>That said, there does seem to be a lot of code running through the speech,
<br>
much as you describe.
<br>
