Helen Fowle asks
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So you're saying that although our sense of self is about how we see and interact with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others, it has no bearing on how we interact with our body - that is, by changing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body, the self remains the same? And that if our body becomes loaded with more functions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and more senses via uploading, or less drastic modifications, then our 'self' will not
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; affected by this?  You need to explain more Mike, I really haven't got the jist of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you were saying.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I can't speak for Mike, but the contention of many of us is that while of course
<br>
the body is important to one's self-image, one's self would not necessarily change in
<br>
the important ways if one were to obtain bodily enhancements or be uploaded.  Naturally
<br>
one's self would be affected; but you are affected every time you put on different
<br>
clothes or visit a tatoo artist.  But the key point is that one can &quot;suffer&quot; such
<br>
changes without becoming a different person.
<br>
<p>Let me ask you a question, Helen.  Suppose that via an advanced surgical technique
<br>
your brain could be removed from your body and placed in another's.  Would you
<br>
necessarily be a different person?  I always enjoyed the science fiction of
<br>
Jack Chalker (&quot;Midnight at the Well of Souls&quot;), and he often had men's minds
<br>
moving to women's bodies and vice-versa.  He rendered excellent descriptions
<br>
of what you might think and feel in a different body, while still remaining
<br>
indubitably yourself.
