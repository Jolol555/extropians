<p>That is surely quite irrelevant one way or the other, isn't it? 
<br>
And I still have a lot of trouble with &quot;left&quot; vs. &quot;right&quot;
<br>
labels.  They are largely irrelevant.  Classification in 2-3
<br>
dimensions is more interesting for categorizing
<br>
political/economic views.

<p><em>&gt;I think it's rather indicative that

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Still doesn't make it a leftist doctrine or issue.  Letting
<br>
legitimate issues be co-opted by the opposition is surely not a
<br>
good idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh, and I forgot, Vermont also has one of the most 'pc' of hate-crime
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Really?  Even regardless of race?  How the heck do they justify
<br>
putting someone in jail for simply using obnoxious and/or
<br>
bigotted language?  True hate-crimes result in people being
<br>
seriously molested and even killed.  Preventing those has
<br>
nothing to do with outlawing words or saying hateful things. 
<br>
And I say this as a member of a couple of sub-populations who
<br>
have suffered altogther too many real hate-crimes.
