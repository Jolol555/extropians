Sign me up with an esthetic modification pack, where I get extreme
<br>
bi-lateral symmetry and bone lengths at exact  fibrionacci relations to each
<br>
other,  6'2'' hight, no signs of aging beyond full development, near
<br>
featureless skin, and an unearthly sparkle in my eyes.
<br>
<p>ok?

<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;(snip)I hope that by posing reasonable simple questions to the people

who are against engineering the human body through technology, then I won't
<br>
annoy them, and they will open up about what really scares them.&quot;&lt;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a sensible concern.  I've had to deal with it quite a bit when
</em><br>
addressing the future of the human body.  People get a little bent when they
<br>
think someone is going to take their body away.  And for a good cause.  &quot;My
<br>
body, my life.&quot;  It's our most fundamental property.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rather than developing a reference guide of standardized questions for the
</em><br>
average person, I ask questions that are individual-based. &quot;You enjoy tennis
<br>
a great deal, what would it be like if you didn't have to worry about tennis
<br>
elbow?&quot;  Or, &quot;As a CEO and a mother, how do you balance you hectic schedule?
<br>
Wouldn't it be wonderful to have an implant communication device so that you
<br>
could communiate feelings with your children just to let them know you love
<br>
them while you are away?&quot;  For basics, most people wear glasses or contacts.
<br>
Many people have had braces or have augmented their teeth with veneers,
<br>
crowns or fillings.  This type of engineered upgrade has modified a large
<br>
percentage of humanity. It may seem silly at first blush to mention, but it
<br>
helps people relax before stretching their imaginations about advanced
<br>
augmentations.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(snip)... I believe that what scares the 'anti' people is based in the
</em><br>
fact that we 'look' human, and that our humanness is linked to our body
<br>
image. This is a strong argument in that it suggests our identity as a
<br>
person is linked very closely to how others, and we see the body. What they
<br>
are suggesting is that by changing the appearance of the human body then we
<br>
are consequently changing our human identity. This seems pretty logical, and
<br>
it bypasses in some way, the argument that our 'identity', or rather our
<br>
'human identity' is just contained within the brain. They'd argue that
<br>
although the information may be stored in the brain, it is still connected
<br>
to how we see the body, therefore what effects the body effects the mind.&lt;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a distinctive image-territoriality among humans to protect and
</em><br>
patrol the human body in a fixed state.  In that the human visual sense is
<br>
an extremely strong component of our psychological make-up and identity,
<br>
altering it drastically could cause a heck of a lot of resentment and fear.
<br>
This is very understandable.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What you need to consider is that changes occur in steps.  Alterations and
</em><br>
modifications to the human body will surely alter visual perceptions of our
<br>
identities and ourselves.  Also consider that multiple personalities will
<br>
also be an alternative with new body designs as well as multiple physical
<br>
vehicles for transportation and communication.  Be careful not to get stuck
<br>
on one body and one identity.  Alternatively, who says a posthuman will not
<br>
resemble a human?
<br>
