I think J.R. Molloy is guilty of extreme insensitivity to say the least.  A reading of _Black Like Me_ by John Griffin could do him a lot of good.  For those who don't know, this book is the true story of a white man who used make-up and pills to appear black in the late fifties south.  You can imagine it was not the most pleasant experience...  And while things have changed for the better, if J.R. were to undergo the experiment he would find life not so easy.

<p>I have encountered actual online racialist Transhumanists(of a sort) who called themselves &quot;Ad Astra&quot;(many organizations share this name) and had an email list I monitored  I had some great dogfights with them and was grateful to Anders Sandberg and Robert Bradbury for helping me out in dealing with them.  Finally, they decided I was some sort of spy in cahoots with Morris Dees and they moved elsewhere(and didn't tell me! lol).     
<br>
<p>best wishes,
