<p>Mike, as best I can figure, a Friendly AI designed the Right Way should
<br>
not become emotionally disturbed even if you tried to abuse it constantly
<br>
over a period of years.  I use the term &quot;abuse&quot; because I don't think
<br>
there's an FAI equivalent for &quot;torture&quot;, or for that matter, &quot;annoy&quot;. 
<br>
What exactly would you do?  Try to frustrate all short-term goals? 
<br>
Randomly zero bits in memory?  The Friendly AI might regard these things
<br>
as undesirable, and make choices so as to minimize their chance of
<br>
recurrence, but I can't see the former - or, in a seed AI, the latter -
<br>
changing the character of the decision-making process.
<br>
<p>That's not a supernaturally powerful special ability, it's an emergent
<br>
consequence of doing the Right Thing for goal systems.  A Friendly AI
<br>
simply cannot be driven insane or even disturbed by any possible
<br>
configuration of external events, and a mature seed AI cannot be driven
<br>
insane or corrupted by any noncooperative human attempt to modify the
<br>
internal data.  Destroyed, perhaps, but not corrupted.  The only way that
<br>
a human-level intelligence can drive a mature Friendly seed AI insane is
<br>
to start over from scratch and write an AI that can be driven insane.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, given the sheer alienness of that kind of perspective,
<br>
I can see a human certification requirement being used to protect humans
<br>
from personality abrasion.  Engaging in conversation with something that
<br>
is enormously saner than you are and has an utterly different mental
<br>
architecture may be a bit hard on the nerves.
<br>
<p>However, I can see non-Friendly AIs with more humanlike emotional
<br>
architectures requiring legal protection.  We don't want to wind up in a
<br>
David Zindell &quot;Festival of Dolls&quot; scenario.  But a Friendly AI can take
<br>
absolutely anything you can throw at it without even blinking.  It may
<br>
sound impressive from a human perspective but it really shouldn't be all
<br>
that hard from the standpoint of general intelligence.  It's only because
<br>
of evolutionary messiness that we ourselves lack absolute rock-hard
<br>
sanity; I think of unalterable sanity as the norm and humans as the
<br>
exception.
