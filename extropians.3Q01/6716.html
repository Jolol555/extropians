<em>&gt; Afghanistan is not southern Iraq.  It's not going to be a repeat of

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Depends. The US military technology is far more advanced than that seen
<br>
by the Afghans with the Soviets. The soviet capabilities then is
<br>
essentially what we saw in Saddam Hussein's army in the Gulf.
<br>
<p>While you are right about the terrain, this is no Vietnam: there is no
<br>
jungle to hide in, night vision technologies and other thermal systems
<br>
have no trouble picking out afghans and mules on a mountainside. I do
<br>
think that we will rush some new technologies through, especially
<br>
backtrack targeting systems that target a gun or missile launcher based
<br>
on munition trajectories it puts out.
<br>
<p>I think instead this will be much like the allies taking northern Italy
<br>
in WWII: relatively higher than usual casualties, but with technological
<br>
superiority, an eventual win.
