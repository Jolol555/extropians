<p>No, they do not say so.  Go read the press release from the NRC.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.nrc.gov/OPA/gmo/nrarcv/01-112.html">http://www.nrc.gov/OPA/gmo/nrarcv/01-112.html</a>
<br>
<p>Here is a specific Q and A from the above:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Q: What would happen if a large commercial airliner was intentionally crashed into a nuclear power plant?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A:. Nuclear power plants have inherent capability to protect public health and safety through such features as robust containment buildings, redundant safety systems,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and highly trained operators. They are among the most hardened structures in the country and are designed to withstand extreme events, such as hurricanes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tornadoes and earthquakes. In addition, all NRC licenses with significant radiological material have emergency response plans to enable the mitigation of impacts on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the public in the event of a release. However, the NRC did not specifically contemplate attacks by aircraft such as Boeing 757s or 767s and nuclear power plants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were not designed to withstand such crashes. Detailed engineering analyses of a large airliner crash have not yet been performed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Jeff, did you read my post from earlier today?  The comments you posted
<br>
about pill boxes would apply if the containments were about the same
<br>
size.  But they are not.  The more volume you have to enclose, the less
<br>
impact strength you get for the same wall thickness.  Also, the weight
<br>
of the building itself goes up with the cube of the scale factor while
<br>
the strength of the walls only goes up with the square, so the bigger
<br>
you build it, the more of its strength goes to just holding it up.
<br>
<p>The safety reports I have seen from the NRC all have a clause that
<br>
states that their figures are only for an &quot;accident&quot; and specifically
<br>
disclaim &quot;intentional&quot; damage.  It is bad enough that one of these would
<br>
go off course and hit, but can you picture flying a 757 in a parabola
<br>
that peaks its 100 tons at 15 km in the sky and then builds up to
<br>
supersonic speed before impact?  I predict the plane would go right
<br>
through and give you a nice fuel-air explosion inside the containment.
<br>
