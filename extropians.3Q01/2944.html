<p><p>US secret agents work at Microsoft: French intelligence
<br>
<p>Source: AFP | Published: Saturday February 19, 7:44 AM
<br>
<p>PARIS, Feb 18 - A French intelligence report today accused US secret agents 
<br>
of working with computer giant Microsoft to develop software allowing 
<br>
Washington to spy on communications around the world.
<br>
<p>The report, drawn up by the Strategic Affairs Delegation (DAS), the 
<br>
intelligence arm of the French Defence Ministry, was quoted in today's 
<br>
edition of the news-letter Le Monde du Renseignement (Intelligence World).
<br>
<p>Written by a senior officer at the DAS, the report claims agents from the 
<br>
National Security Agency (NSA) helped install secret programmes on 
<br>
Microsoft software, currently in use in 90 per cent of computers.
<br>
<p>According to the report there was a 'strong suspicion' of a lack of 
<br>
security fed by insistent rumours about the existence of spy programs on 
<br>
Microsoft, and by the presence of NSA personnel in Bill Gates' development 
<br>
teams.
<br>
<p>The NSA protects communications for the US government, and also intercepts 
<br>
electronic messages for the Defence Department and other US intelligence 
<br>
agencies, the newsletter said.
<br>
<p>According to the report, 'it would seem that the creation of Microsoft was 
<br>
largely supported, not least financially, by the NSA, and that IBM was made 
<br>
to accept the (Microsoft) MS-DOS operating system by the same administration.'
<br>
<p>The report claimed the Pentagon was Microsoft's biggest client in the world.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?

A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
