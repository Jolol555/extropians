<em>&gt;&gt; Wow!  First, do you know that &quot;plonked&quot; means that someone

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a certain person's posts never even get to his mailbox?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If this isn't a frightened tactic of self-censorship, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I don't know what is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You yourself have said it. :)
</em><br>
<p>Um, Michael, no offense.  But I'm really not clear what you 
<br>
mean in this and some succeeding sentences.  I believe that
<br>
you are often prone to sarcasm (though I could be mistaken).
<br>
In these serious exchanges, I would appreciate very much
<br>
some redundancy in your paragraphs---just for the sake of
<br>
understanding them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I hasten to add, that quite often
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; experienced discussion list members employ plonking not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; prevent their eyes from meeting disagreeable points of view,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but rather because someone's posts over a great deal of time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have shown themselves to be without content, or too long, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; some other non-partisan cause.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, gee, let's utterly abnegate the immediately prior paragraph.
</em><br>
<p>Um, now is this sarcasm?  I suppose so.  What are you trying to
<br>
say about my first paragraph?  Did you agree?  Did you disagree?
<br>
I honestly cannot tell.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Lee, I invite you to consider the evidently-unpondered possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that _vocally plonking_ someone can be something very different from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;a frightened tactic of self-censorship&quot;.  It can be a tool of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diplomacy no less than walking out of a stalled negotiation, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (as some have implied) the &quot;cut direct&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Plonking is a &quot;tool&quot; of diplomacy?  Sorry, but it is saying, &quot;what
<br>
you have to say is so worthless that I'm simply closing my ears.
<br>
So take that! You!&quot;    We are *not* negotiating anything here;
<br>
we are trying to find what is true and what is false.  Cutting
<br>
off communication (or even pretending to) does not further that
<br>
aim.
<br>
<p>Now, about &quot;frightening self-censorship&quot;.  My choice of words
<br>
wasn't good, but I guess they get the idea across.  I was not
<br>
talking about _vocal_ plonking, which (as I have said before)
<br>
is puerile in addition to what I said in the previous paragraph.
<br>
<p>No, &quot;partisan plonking&quot;, i.e., at least when it is done just to
<br>
delete incoming mail so that disagreeable arguments don't have
<br>
to even be noticed, is close minded and intellectually crippling.
<br>
(Again, I must hasten to add that experienced people on lists
<br>
have many &quot;non-partisan&quot; reasons for plonking, e.g., perhaps
<br>
plonking an entire thread, which not being personal, is entirely
<br>
different.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In my case, I had had enough. If you have deduced that the sole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause of my recent plonk was &quot;partisan&quot;, I can do nothing for you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except to tell you you are in error.
</em><br>
<p>Michael, it is never true that you &quot;can do nothing&quot; for me
<br>
or anyone else.  You can always point out what is true.
<br>
...as I think you are about to do in:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The behavior I was reacting to was indeed disagreeable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Was it a &quot;point of view&quot;?  No, a simple (stupid) behavior;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the (my) last straw for the time being.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry; could you be more explicit?  What was the exact &quot;behavior&quot;
<br>
that elicited your (a) _verbal_ plonk (i.e. announcements) and
<br>
(b) your silent plonk (if such existed)?  Thanks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; _Silently plonking_ someone is different. How would you, Lee, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know to criticize?
</em><br>
<p>Now what *are* you saying here?  Are you saying that I have
<br>
ever _verbally plonked_ anyone?  (No, I have never.)   OH!
<br>
And I am *only* asking---I didn't mean to imply anything 
<br>
by that :-)   Are you saying that I since I couldn't know
<br>
that someone was doing it, I couldn't criticize it?  Well,
<br>
I criticize people closing their minds to opinions that
<br>
they disagree with (if that answers your question, and
<br>
my apologies if it doesn't).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Plonking means never having to deign to respond.  It gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me more time to talk to scary looking street people.
</em><br>
<p>Again, your meaning is obscured by probable sarcasm.  Since
<br>
sarcastic behavior is often genuinely enjoyable and funny
<br>
(no joke), you might follow it up with another sentence that
<br>
amplifies what you really mean.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Having said this, I do consider every plonk a species of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failure.  In some cases, it's a failure to avoid stepping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in something unappetizing.
</em><br>
<p>Why doesn't one just omit reading some post, or following
<br>
some thread?  Lack of time prevents me from following all
<br>
the threads and reading every post.  But I'm just never
<br>
sure (as perhaps you are) that I'll be *permanently*
<br>
uninterested in some discussion.
<br>
<p>Lee
