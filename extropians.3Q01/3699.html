<p><em>&gt; [Lee Corbin wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Therefore, I will re-phrase Mike Lorrey's original question to you:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why do [often] start off your denunciation of any post you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; disagree with by claiming that the website that is hosting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; information is owned by [someone of a certain stripe]?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I will also ask, why don't you just begin by quoting parts of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; article that offended you, and criticize them instead?  (Honestly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it does give the impression that you cannot.)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Sources of information are important.  Scientific methodology to determine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;facts&quot; are important.  It is fair to point out that statistics were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically funded by an organization to counter more established
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistics that they don't like.
</em><br>
<p>I certainly concede that!  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is fair to point out that someone's &quot;scientific&quot; method involves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mystical methods or beliefs that are not scientifically repeatable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is fair to point out faith-based components that are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falsifiable or testable.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed it is.  No disagreement.  But surely you agree that it would
<br>
have been wrong of me to respond to a Creationist's scientific paper
<br>
by merely pointing out that he is a Creationist, or was funded by
<br>
a Religious institution;  doesn't it surely seem to you that it would
<br>
be more proper for me to address the *contents* of the paper?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is not fair to demand that I go through and refute every single fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without checking the sources for myself.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, for sure!  I don't even demand that you refute every single
<br>
fact :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To ask me to determine the validity of results without reviewing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the experimental method is unfair and time-wasting.
</em><br>
<p>I was not.  I applaud your extra efforts to learn as much as you
<br>
can before responding.  I only object that you didn't really
<br>
address the *content* of the paper before, in effect, dismissing
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you still think I have not answered, try rephrasing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  Why don't you, instead, start your analysis by quoting parts
<br>
of the article that you found problematic, and criticize them instead,
<br>
and only later fit your explanations into the wider context of what
<br>
the background of the writer is, or where he's getting his funding?
<br>
