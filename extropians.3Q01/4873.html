From: &quot;Mitchell, Jerry (3337)&quot;
<br>
&lt;&lt;I was just talking to one of my Asian friends about this and his thoughts
<br>
were that the Asian schools and American were exactly opposite in one
<br>
aspect. He told me that all the way up in grades through high school, kids
<br>
in his country busted their ass, stayed at school from 9AM to 9PM and
<br>
generally excelled. In college, the pace wasnt NEAR as rough. His view of us
<br>
was one where we coast up to the college level and thats where we start
<br>
kicking it in high gear. He even addmitted that the reason that most the
<br>
innovation and excellence from college level education in the US was because
<br>
he knew his buddies back in Korea were slacking and partying. Keep in mind,
<br>
this isnt my view, just my Korean friend. I have no clue of the accuracy as
<br>
I have no experience with foreign school systems.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I always assumed this was because we don't try to educate
<br>
all the idiots at the collegiate level. :)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the absurd way in which the US educational
<br>
system has developed we spend an inordinate amount
<br>
of time and gold on engineering social justice at the secondary
<br>
school level.  This isn't true to the same degree at the college
<br>
level.  My intuitive gut-instinct is to observe that any system
<br>
in which participation is mandatory will be cludgy, ugly,
<br>
and grossly inefficent. Thus the public school system.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface level at least this seems valid..all the
<br>
secondary/elementary schools that don't suck quite
<br>
as badly, or even succeed, always have a larger component
<br>
of choice built in, whether it's poor religous/parochial schools
<br>
(where my education took place), magnet schools, or
<br>
simply public schools created by caucasian/asian demographic
<br>
clustering.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The weird thing is that unless you are talking to someone who
<br>
is fairly elite people get really passionate about how you
<br>
&quot;should support the public schools&quot;.  Literally I have made
<br>
tepid enemies of people by stating (after my opinion was
<br>
solicited) that before I'd send my kids to a public school,
<br>
I'd just not have any.  I'd like to raise the point that to
<br>
a true asshole the public school system is a wonderful idea,
<br>
it's a sponge that keeps the proles in their place. Which is
<br>
more crypto-racist... a conservative who votes with his
<br>
feet..or a liberal who votes for continuity of a tiered
<br>
society via tyranny masquerading as social justice?
<br>
I ask you....
<br>
<p><p>regards,
<br>
Brian
