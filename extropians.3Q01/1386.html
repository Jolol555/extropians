Wow! Excellent piece of research Eliezer! Very cool!
<br>
<p>It missed a couple of points (the fact that their sales reps were dressed 
<br>
as nurses, the marketing of formula as superior to breast milk, the bribing 
<br>
of local officials after bans were imposed...) but basically it covered the 
<br>
main facts. I don't know if Nestle ever stopped doing it.
<br>
<p>I wasn't mentioning it as an example of the failure of capitalism (though 
<br>
it could be seen as a failing of capitalism). All I was saying is that 
<br>
powerful groups can be dangerous and that capitalist groups are no 
<br>
exception. Note that I am not saying that all powerful groups are dangerous 
<br>
or all capitalism is bad. (I have to keep pointing this out, as whenever I 
<br>
don't join in the chant &quot;mmmm... capitalism... gooood&quot; many people seem to 
<br>
jump for their guns branding me as a dirty commie bastard. :)
<br>
<p>Briefly, on the point of women with AIDS and the danger to their babies of 
<br>
infected milk. It is really not &quot;the other side&quot; so much as a side issue. 
<br>
Unfortunately companies can't be expected to donate enough milk formula for 
<br>
kids to live on till weaning, and the very poor will still dilute it too 
<br>
much to make the expensive stuff last longer, and use unsterilised water. 
<br>
Sadly their children are at risk of dying from infected breast milk or 
<br>
infected formula milk -- I really wish there was some easy solution for 
<br>
this. The statistics are mind-numbing! But it doesn't change what I was 
<br>
saying about the jerks at Nestle cynically killing untold numbers of 
<br>
children for money.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Miriam

<em>&gt;Okay, I spoke too soon.  Putting a lot more effort into finding dirt on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Nestle turns up an allegation that Nestle gave away baby formula for free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to mothers in developing nations until their milk dried up, then started
</em><br>
<em>&gt;charging them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I found it difficult to believe any corporation could be that stupid, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the 1970s, although Monsanto recently came close.  But it also seemed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if perhaps legendary, like the kind of legend that often has a remote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;basis in history, and besides, I know that the 1970s are not my own time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and that they used to do things differently back then.  So I did a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more digging.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What actually happened?  As far as I can tell from using Google, Nestle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;identified the Third World as a major market for baby formula.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Unfortunately, baby formula doesn't work quite as well in the developing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world.  Baby formula is supposed to be mixed with pure water and delivered
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in bottles with sterile rubber nipples.  In the third world, pure water
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was the exception rather than the rule; likewise sterilization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Furthermore, because baby formula was relatively much more expensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compared to income, mothers were tempted to &quot;stretch&quot; the powder, diluting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it and degrading the nutritional value.  Activists were outraged and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alleged infant fatality cases; this being the 1970s, Nestle told them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take a hike.  It eventually took a coordinated international boycott to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get Nestle to sign a paper agreeing not to market infant formula in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Third World.  Nobody knows how much effect the boycott had commercially,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but it was a public relations nightmare for Nestle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And the other side of *that* story...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.womensfigures.com/januarynews.html">http://www.womensfigures.com/januarynews.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Politics doesn't only affect medical care in the U.S., but also in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Africa.  A chilling Wall Street Journal article on December 5,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2000, exposed how proposed donations of baby formula by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nestle and Wyeth to Africa to stop the spread of AIDS are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being thwarted by UNICEF.  The article described how African
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; babies face AIDS infection through breastfeeding by their sick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mothers.  Since the beginning of the AIDS crisis, 3.4 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; babies worldwide are estimated to have been infected by their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mothers, more than half of them through breastfeeding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; UNICEF supports breastfeeding for mothers in Africa, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; says that mothers with AIDS should be informed of the risk of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; infecting babies and told of alternatives.  However, most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AIDS-infected mothers are extremely poor, and can hardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; afford to buy milk in the store, let alone a 1 lb tin of formula
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; costing $6.00, as it does in Uganda.  For such mothers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information about alternatives is no use without free formula: if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they don't breastfeed the babies, they will die of starvation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why can't Wyeth and Nestle donate formula to low-income
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mothers?  In the 1970s corporations marketed formula to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mothers, giving out free samples which supposedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discouraged breastfeeding.  Activists protested, leading the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; corporations to sign a 1980s agreement, imposing a ban on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the donation of formula.  This agreement was put in place long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; before the AIDS epidemic was ever envisaged.  But today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; African babies are paying the price, because UNICEF will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; alter the agreement, even in cases of dire need.  For example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in July, 2000, when formula supplies in Nsambya Hospital in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Uganda ran out, Nestle offered to donate 4.4 tons.  The offer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was refused, and women were told to fend for themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Moral of the story:  Never trust a single source.  That is just so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pre-Web.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;...and this all shows the failure of capitalism *how*?
