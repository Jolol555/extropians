<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                           August 21,

<p>BRAIN-INSPIRED COMPUTING 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new NASA-developed computing device allows machines to work much like
<br>
the brain.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This technology may allow fast-thinking machines to make decisions
<br>
based on what they 
<br>
see.  A planetary rover might use this technology to avoid obstacles, select
<br>
scientifically 
<br>
interesting spots to explore just by what it sees and navigate through
<br>
terrain on its own without 
<br>
review from ground controllers.  A spacecraft might use the technology to
<br>
avoid hazards and 
<br>
identify a pre-selected landing site with very high precision.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This may well be recognized as a quantum leap in the pursuit of
<br>
intelligent vision, 
<br>
allowing machines to be significantly more autonomous,&quot; said Dr. Anil
<br>
Thakoor, supervisor of 
<br>
the Bio-Inspired Technology and Systems Group at NASA's Jet Propulsion
<br>
Laboratory in 
<br>
Pasadena, Calif.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The device works much like the brain, whose power comes from the
<br>
complex networks 
<br>
of interconnections called synapses between brain cells. Networks of these
<br>
brain cells, called 
<br>
neurons, allow humans to make instant decisions based on an observed image
<br>
or scene.  The new 
<br>
processor captures the same capability to process images in real time as a
<br>
scene unfolds.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Three-Dimensional Artificial Neural Network processor is capable of
<br>
recognizing 
<br>
objects in real time and in highly cluttered background scenes.  It can
<br>
process an image and is 
<br>
capable of a certain degree of judgment about the objects, much the same way
<br>
as a person looks 
<br>
at a variety of objects and makes judgments about the nature of those
<br>
objects. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two technologies give the compact processor an unprecedented ability to
<br>
process a 
<br>
stream of images in a way similar to that used by the human eye-brain
<br>
combination.  One is the 
<br>
JPL-pioneered, highly interconnected networks of ultra-low-power electronic
<br>
synapses on very-
<br>
large-scale-integrated (VLSI) chips that mimic the core of a brain.  The
<br>
other is the three-
<br>
dimensional stacking of those chips in a sugar-cube sized package developed
<br>
by Irvine Sensors 
<br>
Corporation, Costa Mesa, Calif.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The device achieves a computing speed of more than a trillion
<br>
operations per second 
<br>
using only 8 watts of power.  That is more than a thousand times faster than
<br>
a typical 
<br>
commercially available desktop computer that consumes more than 100 watts of
<br>
power. 
<br>
Engineers believe potential commercial benefits for the new technology may
<br>
be found in 
<br>
public safety and in creating a personal computer that can respond to users'
<br>
emotional states by 
<br>
simply recognizing the users' facial expressions.  The development may also
<br>
be useful to the 
<br>
video game industry in improving interactive technologies. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JPL's Center for Space Microelectronics Technology, under sponsorship
<br>
from the 
<br>
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, developed the processor.  The
<br>
processor allows real time 
<br>
onboard target recognition by an interceptor for missile defense. Managed
<br>
for NASA by the 
<br>
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, JPL is the lead U.S. center
<br>
for robotic 
<br>
exploration of the solar system.
