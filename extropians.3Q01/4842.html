</em><br>
<p>Sexual selection already has a distinct definition.  Furthermore, sexual
<br>
selection in this technical sense is very often a dysgenic pressure when
<br>
considered in terms of environmental fitness rather than competitive
<br>
reproductive fitness.
<br>
<p><a href="http://singinst.org/CFAI/info/glossary.html#gloss_sexual_selection">http://singinst.org/CFAI/info/glossary.html#gloss_sexual_selection</a>
<br>
<p>Sexual selection:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexual selection is a kind of evolutionary positive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feedback that can result in ridiculous and even
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suicidal traits becoming overwhelming evolutionary
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advantages, leading in some cases to a kind of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genetic suicide. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose that there's some species - let's call it a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;tailbird&quot; - that happens to have a small, ordinary,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unassuming tail.  It also happens that the tails of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;healthy tailbirds are slightly more colorful, more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lustrous, then the tails of tailbirds that are sick, or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;undernourished.  One day, a female tailbird is born
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a mutation that causes it to sexually prefer
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tailbirds with bright-colored tails.  This is a survival
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trait - it results in the selection of healthier male
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mates, with better genes - so the trait propagates
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until, a few dozen generations later, the entire
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;species population of female tailbirds prefers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bright-colored tails. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, a male is born that has a very bright tail.  It's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not bright because the male is healthy; it's bright
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because the male has a mutation that results in a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brighter tail.  All the females prefer this male, so the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mutation is a big success. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This male tailbird isn't actually healthier.  In fact,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this male is pretty sick.  More of his biological
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resources are going into maintaining that flashy tail. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you might think that the females who preferred
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that male would tend to have sickly children, and the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prefer-bright-tails trait would slowly fade out of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;population. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, that's not what happens.  What
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;happens is that even though the male has sickly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children, they're sickly children with bright tails.  And
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those children also attract a lot of females.  Genes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can't detect &quot;cheating&quot; and instantly change tactics;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that's a monopoly of conscious intelligence.  Any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;females who prefer the non-bright-tailed males will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actually do worse.  These &quot;wiser&quot; females will have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children who are, sexually, out of fashion.  Bright tails
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are no longer a survival advantage, but they are a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very strong sexual advantage. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection pressures for sexual advantages are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;often much stronger than selection pressures for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mere survival advantages.  From a design
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perspective this is stupid - but evolution doesn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;care.  Sexual selection is also a Red Queen's Race: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It involves competition with conspecifics, so you can
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never have a tail that's &quot;bright enough&quot;.  This is how
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you get peacocks. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any time you see an enormously exaggerated trait
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the tail of a peacock, the antlers of a buck, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intelligence of a human - it's a good guess that two
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forces are at work:  Competition with conspecifics,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sexual selection.
