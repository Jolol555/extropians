<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hahahahaha hehehehe!  We can barely get 20,000 people to attend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; a protest rally on these subjects and you want to get them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; lay their lives, fortunes and citizenship on the line to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; actually seceed from the US?  It is a fun dream but I think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is really dreamland right now.  Assuming you can find these find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Libertarian brave souls, do you think they will have the means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; or the will to develop a strong enough Defense to survive?  Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; are we talking major technology breakthrough that throws a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; forcefield around the entire state?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a) NH's state constitution retains the right to secede, and has since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; before it became the 9th and ratifying signor of the US Constitution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, sure.  But we saw what happened the last time any states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempted that.  I have little reason to believe the response
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today would be less extreme.  Particularly if the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state/country is set up with laws quite different than the US.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can imagine the excuses for the US to respond militarily.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; b) What makes you think a defense is needed beyond the existing state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Air Guard units?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I doubt the existing Air Guard would be sufficient against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combined military of the rest of the US.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; c) YOU can barely get 20 people to agree with your cynicism, but you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't seem to be aware that the Free State Project has been done before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not cynicism at all.  It is despair of any such scheme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being workable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The fellow who started the current incarnation is a Yale person who has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dug up evidence that there was a similar organization in the early 70's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at Yale whose purpose was to flood a small state with left wingers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tip its political balance. The state they chose was Vermont, and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; did get the numbers they wanted to move there, and look at the result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; today: socialized medicine, gay marriage, anti-logging laws, and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; confiscatory state education finance law, as well as anti-growth laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and a ban on BGH in the state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Excuse me but there is not a damn thing wrong with gay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marriage.  There is something wrong with bigots telling me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my desire to marry the partner of my choice is wrong or a matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the moral or political decadence.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't say it wasn't, but you must admit that this is a policy that is
<br>
generally exclusive to the left. I think it's rather indicative that
<br>
Vermont is the only state to legalize this AND that the state supreme
<br>
court decision that mandated the legislature craft such a law used
<br>
typically leftist 'judicial activism' in inventing an interpretation of
<br>
the state constitution that claimed to read something that was not
<br>
there.
<br>
<p>Oh, and I forgot, Vermont also has one of the most 'pc' of hate-crime
<br>
laws, where individuals have been convicted and put in jail for simply
<br>
using the 'n' word.
