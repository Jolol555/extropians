<p><em>&gt; [Mike Lorrey wrote]

<em>&gt;&gt; These sentiments about affirmative action and reparations arise in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; liberal white person from the same opinions (no matter how guiltily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; felt) about the inferiority of black people that results from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; stereotypes and ignorance, feelings that blacks are somehow less capable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of achievement as individuals than whites. Just as the KKK racist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; discriminates by hate and exclusion, the liberal racist discriminates by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; guilt and coddling, and both do it on a basis of skin color rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the character of the individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Condescension is a more insidious, virulent and ultimately destructive form of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racism than outright hostility.  They both hurt, but only the first 'stabs the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other in the back' by weakening the discriminated-against person's self-esteem 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by association with one who seems to deign to coddle the unworthy other only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of pity.  To hate and oppose up front is to establish the other as an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemy, and thus, implicitly, as a worthy adversary, one worthy of spending 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's time and effort laboring against, and one whose abilities require same, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is, one to be reckoned with, and by this means the hater confers, perhaps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite unwillingly, but confers, nevertheless, a correlative oppositional 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equality upon the other in a roundabout way.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Exactly.  In fact, if black people have not &quot;assimilated&quot; economically
<br>
as much as other groups, it is entirely possible that part of the cause is
<br>
the economic condescension in affirmative action, which can operate just as
<br>
you say.  Welfare policies that were, or are, targeted at inner-city black
<br>
people can have the same devastating psychological impacts that you describe.
<br>
<p>On a related note, I also think that few attempts should be essayed
<br>
to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; harden criminals for these same reasons.  It's a
<br>
little arrogant of the prison officials and psychiatrists to assume
<br>
that they are so much more intelligent and so much superior to the
<br>
inmate that they can alter him in a prescribed way.  It's a little
<br>
like O'Brien's alleged mastery of psychology that allowed him, in
<br>
Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;, to completely brainwash those whose beliefs and
<br>
behavior were &quot;incorrect&quot;.  The same goes for the &quot;re-education
<br>
camps&quot; in Communist nations, of course.
