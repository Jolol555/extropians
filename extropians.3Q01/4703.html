<em>&gt; $5K per year?  Maybe.  $2K per year?  No way.  Come September 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll be paying 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $8,500 for a year's worth of a 1st grade education (and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's one of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheapest schools I could find in the entire county).  Even at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school is constantly griping the entire year that they don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have enough to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pay the teachers a decent wage, and they're constantly asking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for donations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and help with fundraisers all year long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An unsubsidized $5K per year elementary school education is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably going 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to buy you a classroom where kids outnumber teachers by 40 to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1, and a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teacher who is earning barely enough to stay above the poverty line.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Zero
</em><br>
<p>You neglect the impact of  economies of scale. Right now, there isnt much of
<br>
an impact, but if all schools were private, the situation would be quite
<br>
pronounced. Besides, theres no studies that show a difference in the quality
<br>
of education declining if classroom sizes increase from say 30 to 50. It
<br>
sounds like there should be, but it reality, if you have 30 students, you
<br>
dont have a lot of time with individual students anyways. Double the size of
<br>
the class and you can drop prices dramatically.
