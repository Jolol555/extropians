<p><em>&gt;  I answered &quot;yes&quot; to all of those questions. Does this make me idealistic or

<em>&gt;

<em>&gt;  their own merits. How does preventing this lead to a better society?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  <a href="http://www.exratio.com/">http://www.exratio.com/</a> &gt;&gt;&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Re draft: It's not conceivable to you that a war, if won by a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side, would lead to a better outcome for humanity than if the other side won,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that a draft might affect the outcome?
</em><br>
<p>Affect, yes, but which way?  Forcing all of our resources under a
<br>
central directive, with the increased likelihood of more casualties,
<br>
as opposed to letting people come up with their own solutions and
<br>
increase our technological edge over just about any enemy...at least
<br>
for the USA, I believe the draft now does more harm than good in that
<br>
respect.  It will also help force us out of wars we should not be
<br>
fighting (like Vietnam), when those in power get incorrect notions that
<br>
the public at large sees through.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Re free speech: It's not conceivable that public airing of military or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patented information might be bad for humanity? That it might not be in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best interest of humanity to allow unrestrained libel?
</em><br>
<p>The purpose of patents is to communicate the ideas to the public, so
<br>
broadcasting them is actually a good thing.  As for military - if our
<br>
own public broadcasters have as good data on sensitive military info as
<br>
someone we're waging war against, our enemies are screwed to the point
<br>
that this won't make a difference anyway.  That said, it is the
<br>
military's responsibility, not the public's, to keep their secret data
<br>
secret.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Re borders: It's not conceivable that a completely open Mexico-U.S. border
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would lead to a mass exodus from Mexico and might just possibly have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deleterious effects on one or both countries?
</em><br>
<p>You mean like how people wouldn't die trying to cross illegally, and
<br>
more workers could generate wealth in the US and send a fraction of it
<br>
(their paycheck, less US taxes) back home to help build up Mexico?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Re minimum wage: It's not conceivable that a repeal of the minimum wage might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause greater poverty and other unwanted effects (such as more inter-class
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strife)? Economics is no science. You ought not be so sure you know with such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assuredness the outcome of tweaking the parameters.
</em><br>
<p>This one I'll grant.  The perceived value of brute labor, from the
<br>
perspective of MBAed managers with no concept of honest labor, is often
<br>
less than its actual value.  Besides, this helps subsidize robotics:
<br>
if it's cheaper to build a machine to do a job than to task some human
<br>
with boring, rote, mechanical work...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Re foreign aid: It's not coneivable that foreign aid might be better in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long run for giver and receiver than its absence and that privately funded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign aid just might not be sufficient for this betterment?
</em><br>
<p>It's a good idea in theory.  In practice, it rarely actually goes to
<br>
the ends that it was intended.  Take the large fraction of aid
<br>
shipments to African countries which are intercepted en route to the
<br>
hungry villagers, then sold to benefit the local junta.  Now, if
<br>
foreign aid were accompanied by guards with the ability to do something
<br>
about these interceptions, or something else along the lines of a
<br>
&quot;smart contract&quot;...
