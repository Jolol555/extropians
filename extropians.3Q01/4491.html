<em>&gt;Well, as we say, &quot;wishes don't make horses&quot;.  What possible incentive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would anyone have to lie awake at night thinking of the best way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;treat farmworkers?   Now, yes, it's easy to imagine &quot;a man on horseback&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as a recent poster put it, or a &quot;Stalin&quot; whose heart would be in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right place; but over and over we learn what happens when that approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is tried.
</em><br>
<p>In principle there are people who are motivated to lie awake at night
<br>
worrying about farm workers, just as there are those who lie awake at
<br>
night worrying about grocery customers.  These are the employers of
<br>
the farm workers.  If they can offer better working conditions, they
<br>
can increase their profit margins, just as providing better selling
<br>
conditions in the supermarket will increase profits of market owners.
<br>
<p>I think the reason why the motivation doesn't work as well for farm
<br>
employers (and employers in general) compared to sellers, is that it is
<br>
harder for people to change jobs than to change supermarkets.  Providing
<br>
even a tiny improvement over other stores may attract more customers
<br>
right away, but providing better jobs will have relatively less of an
<br>
effect because people don't like to change jobs, for a lot of reasons.
