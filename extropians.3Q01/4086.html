<p>I agree.
<br>
<p>Personally, I don't like &quot;transparency&quot; (the phenomenon of various
<br>
busy-bodies having a permanent field day, looking over all shoulders
<br>
at all times). Thank you, but no, thank you.
<br>
<p>My life is my own.

Mine, and mine alone.

<p>I will not be pushed,

briefed, debriefed or numbered.
