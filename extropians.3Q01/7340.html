<em>&gt; Harvey, if I gave you a number of images, some of them with and some

</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry for dismissing this so quickly.  Let's go ahead and try this.  I
<br>
think it would be interesting.  I am really to busy to do this, but I'll do
<br>
my best to find some time.
<br>
<p>I would like you to give me a series of pictures specifically as a test.  I
<br>
do not want to try to detect possible pictures from a third party source
<br>
that may or may not have messages.  I want you to be able to tell me
<br>
definitively which ones have messages and which ones don't.
<br>
<p>You can grab a set of pictures from anywhere or use your own if you are a
<br>
photographer.  Put steganographic messages is some of them.  Send them to me
<br>
as e-mail attachments (they don't have to go to the whole list).  I will try
<br>
to analyze them and tell you which ones have messages and which ones don't.
<br>
I'll also try to give a percentage rating of how sure I think I am.  I'll
<br>
post my guesses to the list, and you can tell me how many I got right and
<br>
how many I got wrong.
<br>
<p>This actually sounds like fun, and I was really annoyed that my immediate
<br>
response was that I was too busy to do this.  I get so tired of being to
<br>
busy.  I need to make time for fun stuff like this.
