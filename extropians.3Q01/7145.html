<p>Actually, it doesn't seem to be that effective unless you do sweeping
<br>
searches. Terrorists plan their deeds in secret, then act openly - which
<br>
means the privacy invasion would only prevent their actions if it could
<br>
with a high likeliehood find secret planning before the fact (which
<br>
requires sweeping a large part of the population, and the assumption the
<br>
terrorists doesn't communicate outside systems amenable for sweeping -
<br>
like writing letters or meeting face to face, assuming spooks are not
<br>
given the right to read letters and bug every location of course). After
<br>
the fact, privacy invasion might help track them down, but here there
<br>
are already an extensive pre-existing system of how this should be done
<br>
and no real need for new legislation.
<br>
<p>The risk is that we get a lot of snooping that is technically legal
<br>
thanks to legislation passed in a panic (by politicians fearful of jets
<br>
falling on their own heads!), but which is not done for the reasons
<br>
intended. 
<br>
<p>As a libertarian and minarchist, my view of the current events is that
<br>
finding and punishing those responsible is actually the job of the
<br>
government - one of the few things it is intended for. It should have
<br>
the right legal powers to do this, and do it in a way that helps the
<br>
interests of the citizens. Nothing else. This means that 1) extending
<br>
legal powers after a terrorist attack should only be done if there is
<br>
compelling evidence that they will be necessary and useful in the
<br>
future, 2) hurting innocents in the process of finding and punishing
<br>
must be kept minimal. It is actually ethically better that a villain
<br>
escapes that you (or your government, acting on your behalf) kills an
<br>
innocent. 
<br>
<p>Privacy might not be a sacred primary value, but there needs to be a
<br>
symmetry in power between the government and its citizens. If the
<br>
government is given the right to snoop, then the accountability of the
<br>
government must also be ratcheted up. This is not being done right now,
<br>
quite the reverse.
