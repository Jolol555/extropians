<p><em>&gt; &quot;What is the advantage of direct experience of reality?&quot;, Lee Corbin has asked.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To me this question looks frustratingly contrarian, because it's like someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a prison cell asking what is the advantage of looking out a window.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even more frustrating as I need to use words to try to seduce your attention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away from words in order to try the simple (but nevertheless arduous)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment of going beyond words, to catch a glimpse of the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ineffably abiding beyond symbology, semantics, semiotics... words.
</em><br>
<p>This, again, is something that Korzybski talked about frequently.  He
<br>
would set up elaborate seminars in which students would try to come
<br>
to understand different &quot;levels of abstraction&quot;.  His favorite exercise
<br>
was to have a student grasp a pencil and hold it close to his or
<br>
her sense organs, and avoid using any words---even internally---to 
<br>
characterize the experience.  Just turn the pencil around and around,
<br>
and savor---I suppose---the raw sensual experience.  His point was
<br>
&quot;you cannot *say* what the pencil is&quot;, and, of course, &quot;the map is
<br>
not the territory&quot;.
<br>
<p>Okay, so this is old hat, at least to me.  Yes, there is a universe
<br>
outside of our skins &quot;beyond symbology, semantics, semiotics... words&quot;,
<br>
just as you say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is not a new way of thinking, it's the way humans can experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence beyond thinking, and it changes forever the way one looks at life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is good to look at a flower scientifically. A more complete view of reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; includes the remembrance that one is looking at a flower scientifically.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it never changed forever the way that I look at life; I grant the
<br>
value of this exercise for people who don't understand the process of
<br>
abstracting, but this applies to very few adults these days IMO.
