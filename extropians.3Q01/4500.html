<em>&gt; &gt; What we don't know is whether Newton was or was not one of those rare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people with four types of color cones in their retinas. If he was, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could explain the seven color statement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Probably not.  People who can detect four colors (called &quot;tetrachromates&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see two shades of what we would call &quot;green&quot; (near the middle of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spectrum).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it is more probable that he called cyan &quot;blue&quot; (like the sky) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then called the darker pure blue &quot;indigo&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>These are not mutually exclusive. Cones are not just sensitive in
<br>
specific wavelengths, they have bell curve sensitivity ranges that
<br>
extend far outside their areas of peak sensitivity, and the addition of
<br>
an additional cone type would create entirely different perceptions of
<br>
color gradients.
<br>
<p>Deer, for example, have only blue and yellow cones, yet they are not
<br>
blind to wavelengths in between, they simply see them as various blue
<br>
and yellow shades of gray, and they also see deep into the ultraviolet
<br>
with their blue cones, which makes the industrial brightening dyes in
<br>
much human clothing and clothing detergents to stand out like neon
<br>
lights. They see reds and oranges as simply shades of yellow that blend
<br>
into the natural yellow background of nature (which is why wearing blaze
<br>
orange is better than wearing jeans when hunting).
<br>
<p>Deer cannot, for instance, see green simply because they do not have red
<br>
cones. Green to them is just a shade of gray. Similarly, being a
<br>
tetrachromate would allow not only more ultraviolet sensitivity (which
<br>
is what I've read is a reported phenomenon of tetrachromates) but would
<br>
provide the person with greater sensitivity to more normal color
<br>
gradients as well.
<br>
<p>You can, for instance, simulate deer sight with your computer monitor by
<br>
turning down to zero its red sensitivity.
