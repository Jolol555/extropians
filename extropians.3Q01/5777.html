<em>&gt; &quot;Running your own company is hard/complex/abstruse and difficult&quot;. Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;people at the top of industry are there because they're somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superhumanly good at what they do, and mere mortals can't compete.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Corollaries:
<br>
&quot;Large organizations, or even just the heads thereof, are generally
<br>
aware of what their member offices are doing.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;...alternately, &quot;Large organizations are necessarily competent and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;efficient.&quot;  (That may have been the hope, but few achieve it in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;practice.  But they are large.)
<br>
&quot;Complex tasks which are not undertaken, are usually not undertaken
<br>
because of their technical difficulty.&quot;  (Finances and politics are far
<br>
more often the idea killers.)
<br>
&quot;There are monolithic large entities.&quot;  (There are the appearance of
<br>
such, certainly, and many people use the illusion as an excuse to do
<br>
acts, both good and bad, in an entity's name.  But it's like large
<br>
crystals: past a certain size, the best one can get is a collection of
<br>
similar smaller pieces, perhaps adjusted to be even more similar over
<br>
time, packed together in the resemblance of a gem.  Close inspection
<br>
gives it away; one hard tap can spin a piece off.)
<br>
&quot;You shall have one and only one type of job for your entire working
<br>
life.&quot;
<br>
&quot;People always learn to do their job better as time goes by.&quot;  (Some
<br>
do.)
<br>
&quot;Older means wiser.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Younger means cleverer.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Your boss rose through the ranks, and knows how to do your job better
<br>
than you do.&quot;
