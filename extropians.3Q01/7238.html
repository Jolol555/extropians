<p>I am curious.  Do we really have direct evidence that a lot of people were
<br>
consciously making a decision to jump?  Or are people just assuming that
<br>
most of the falling bodies were suicides?
<br>
<p>The smoke and heat would drive everyone to hang out the windows for air.
<br>
Explosions, firestorms, backdrafts, wind gusts, structure instability,
<br>
falling debris would have knocked many people from their precarious perches
<br>
hanging out the windows.  Burning metal, cutting glass, suffocating smoke
<br>
and fatigue would also cause many to lose their grip or be unable to
<br>
continue to hang on.  We also have seen many sad examples of trampling and
<br>
uncontrolled stampeding when too many people are trying to squeeze toward a
<br>
small opening to escape a fire.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying that suicide is not an option, but I have no reason to assume
<br>
that most of the falling bodies are people who decided to take their own
<br>
lives.  Human psychology usually drives people to more desperate measures to
<br>
survive.  To my knowledge, a mass suicide during a disaster seems unlikely.
<br>
We have not seen this in previous disaster or in war time.  Some cases of
<br>
suicide undoubtedly exist, but I think the vast majority of these people
<br>
were direct victims of the disaster and did not take their own lives.
