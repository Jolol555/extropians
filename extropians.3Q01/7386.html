<em>&gt;From Nature 413:238-239
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; [technologies] include 'biometrics' for confirming the identity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passengers, computerized pattern recognition to identify weapons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hidden in baggage or under clothing, and even an extension of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; auto-pilot technologies to prevent hijackers from assuming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manual control of airliners.
</em><br>
<p>I'll note the use of &quot;extension of auto-pilot technologies&quot;
<br>
which was precisely what I suggested a few weeks ago.
<br>
<p>In terms of &quot;changing ones mind&quot;, I think I am becoming less
<br>
opposed to &quot;public transparency&quot; in situations that require
<br>
a high level of trust between citizens in public.  Airline
<br>
passengers, and to lesser extent railroad passengers or people
<br>
attending large public meetings (concerts, sports stadiums, etc.)
<br>
need to be able to have a sense of security regarding the people
<br>
around them.
<br>
<p>In these situations, I do not think it is unreasonable to
<br>
require unobtrusive biometric verification of identity,
<br>
particularly if the citizen is the only person with a
<br>
copy of the data and the security of the cards containing
<br>
the data is highly trustable.
<br>
<p>This would of course be less feasible for foreign citizens
<br>
who may not have easy access to the required identity cards.
<br>
This does at least allow you to focus the attention of
<br>
security on those individuals.
<br>
<p>Useful data:
<br>
<em>&gt; There is also scope to improve security on board aircraft. Strengthening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cockpit doors with Kevlar, a lightweight, bulletproof substance, for example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would cost only $2,000 per aircraft -- and could be combined with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedures to keep cabin doors locked during flight.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; El Al, equips its guards with nylon composite bullets that can disable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hijackers without threatening cabin walls
</em><br>
<p>Also mentioned were requirements for automating pattern recognition
<br>
of weapons, knives, box cutters, etc.
<br>
