<p>But if the original is very unlikely to remain in the &quot;baby pop&quot; (or

of her was so successful (that niche is also likely to be changed; even

today's retro-70's music is not produced and based on the same kind of

people and processes it was in the 70's; hence few of the clones would
<br>
have a chance for a successful baby pop career either), then her clones
<br>
will not be more successful than other, genetically different,
<br>
contenders for the her current market niche.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if we

</em><br>
<p>Sure, but that was not your original claim. I think this is a far better
<br>
argument against wild cloning than the competition argument.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So if I'm very successful my genes might become widespread. Hmm, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sounds almost like an *incentive* for becoming successful to most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people. (As for myself, I go the direct way and try to make my memes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; successful - you will all end up as my mental clones! Muhahahah! ;-)=
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think so. People don't think in terms of wanting to make their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genes more widespread, because our genes haven't had a chance to co-evolve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with that recent meme. Maybe they will think that way eventually if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain other things don't happen to make genes entirely obsolete, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right now I think if you ask most people whether they mind being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involuntarily cloned, they would say yes.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe. But if your argument that people don't view clones as &quot;their own
<br>
flesh and blood&quot; holds, and the market argument doesn't hold, then there
<br>
will be no reason for people not to be successful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sure. It is a more serious problem, not just economically but also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ethically. As Nick Szabo suggested at Extro 5, it is really one of the
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is his talk available online anywhere?
</em><br>
<p>Maybe on the conference website.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You can hide it randomly in the genome, making the cloning far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expensive. OK, with full decompilation technology it could be done, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then cloning will be a relativiely trivial technology anyway and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could start designing encrypted genomes instead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wasn't aware you could hide genes like this. How would you go about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing it so that you can't find the genes without full decompilation?
</em><br>
<p>The trick is to put it in randomly somewhere (close to other genes that
<br>
have promoters sensitive to the remethylation), so that it gets hidden
<br>
in the complexity of the genome. It is not a perfect way, but likely
<br>
very hard to fix without a careful decompilation.
