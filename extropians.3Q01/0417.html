<p><em>&gt; Sure, because you know enough to make informed choices, you are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intimidated by long latin-derived scientific words. Nor do you blindly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept what the media and left wing groups spout as gospel. The problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that a large number of people do, and repeat it enough that such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; garbage eventually becomes 'common knowledge'. The average consumer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not understand enough of the debate to make rational informed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choices because they don't have the scientific skills to do so, and will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead rely on who makes them most fearful for the safety and health of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their family.
</em><br>
<p>In general, I dare say, if our economy shifted from a reward oriented society (where one seeks to
<br>
maximise control of resources and power), to a compensation oriented one (where one receives
<br>
reimbursiment for contributing useful to the society), then we would not have this problem. Such a
<br>
society will allow people to pursue their interests and research without worrying about having to
<br>
feed themselves, or their families.
<br>
<p>With a system of full disclosure so that people can conduct research that builds on each other's
<br>
insights and discoveries, we would have no problems with full disclosure. This would resemble the
<br>
concept of &quot;open source&quot; as applied to an entire society.
<br>
<p>I do not intend to create a utopia, but merely a society more acceptable to rational people than the
<br>
current, primitive ones we have on Earth. Of course, such a society will also face its limitations.
<br>
For instance, people of this society must have the capability to act rationally and the bona fide
<br>
intention to do so. However, I do have some possible solutions for how to overcome these
<br>
limitations.
