<em>&gt; &gt; One of the best things I have ever found for time management is to get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; little electronic pocket organizer.
</em><br>
<p><p>I agree that organizers can change one's life for the better. For many years
<br>
I've used a paper Daytimer and only recently acquired a Palm m100. I was
<br>
pleased with it during the few days it functioned. Had to send it back and
<br>
get a new one, which I only got back yesterday. It's a pretty basic model,
<br>
but even so it's superior to a paper organizer.
<br>
<p>One of the most important functions of the Daytimer for me was to assist me
<br>
in prioritizing my to-do list. I'm not sure the Palm is going to fill this
<br>
need, although it might work if used in conjunction with a laptop. It's
<br>
helpful (at least for me) to have a list of goals (for whatever period of
<br>
time whether day, week, year, or lifetime) written down where I can see all
<br>
of them at the same time.
<br>
<p>I've observed that most people spend most of their time doing stuff that
<br>
seems urgent but does not move them toward their most important goals. I
<br>
think this is what's happening on a large scale with the reaction to the
<br>
terrorist attack. I do this too if I don't write down and prioritize a list
<br>
of possibilities for each day, always keeping in mind long-term goals and
<br>
prioritizing accordingly. Picking a day at random from my past, December 12,
<br>
1997. My most basic long-term goal was to live as long and as happily as
<br>
possible. This is not terribly useful, but it does provide a set of
<br>
constraints. For example, I would ordinarily reject the idea of spending ten
<br>
minutes to smoke a cigarette or an hour to drink a few beers and drive my
<br>
car, as these would conflict with my most basic goal.
<br>
<p>One of my long-term sub goals was improving methods of growing food plants
<br>
in areas with no soil or very poor soil. In order to have time to study and
<br>
do experiments, I had to be able to live without the necessity of holding
<br>
down a full-time job (unless I could have found a full-time job studying
<br>
methods of growing plant foods--but I had checked into this and found that
<br>
the closest I could come would be to enroll in a graduate program at a
<br>
university; and none of the programs I looked into appealed to me).
<br>
<p>So I had a whole set of subgoals connected with keeping my nut small, so to
<br>
speak. One of these was to build a house. Since being dirty, cold, and wet
<br>
did not seem to advance my long-term goal of living long and happily, it had
<br>
to be a house that would stay warm and dry in winter; and I needed water for
<br>
bathing and household cleaning. On December 11, 1997 the house was already
<br>
built but needed some tightening.
<br>
<p>Thus, the day's activities:
<br>
<p>1. cut and split firewood
<br>
<p>2. build pump house (I had already installed a pump and pipes to carry pond
<br>
water to the kitchen and bathroom via a clarifying tank, but I needed to
<br>
enclose the pump so I could have running water even during freezing
<br>
weather)--I notice I listed each step of building the pump house and an
<br>
estimated time so I could be sure to get it done (eg. Cut posts to 61&quot; .2
<br>
hour; set posts in ground .5; cut cross pieces .2 etc.)
<br>
<p>3. weather stripping on door
<br>
<p>4. insulate water pipe between tank and pump
<br>
<p>5. drain pipes and pump if frost protection not complete
<br>
<p>6. collect kindling
<br>
<p>7. read chapter Paleoethnobotany
<br>
<p>8. make apple pie
<br>
<p>9. Fill cracks in floor
<br>
<p>10. Check that greenhouse is squared away
<br>
<p>There wasn't enough time in the day to do all these things, because the pump
<br>
house would take quite a while to do. So I had to prioritize. The first hard
<br>
freeze of the season was predicted for that night.
<br>
<p>Splitting firewood got low priority, because I already had enough to last
<br>
for a while. So that would be the last thing I'd do--I'd get around to it
<br>
only if I had time.
<br>
<p>I gave the pump house high priority, because without it I'd have to drain
<br>
the pump and water pipes and wouldn't have running water for the duration of
<br>
the freeze. I'm not sure I'd choose the same way today, but I probably would
<br>
simply because I enjoy bathing. This is a situation where I was picking a
<br>
goal mostly for short-term pleasure  (having running water at the end of
<br>
December, 1997 probably didn't lengthen my life, but neither did it shorten
<br>
my life)
<br>
<p>Weather-stripping the door was low priority since I could keep warm even
<br>
with drafts by burning a little extra firewood (as it happens, there's no
<br>
shortage of firewood here)
<br>
<p>Insulating the pipes was of the same level of priority as the pump house,
<br>
since both things were necessary in order to have running water during
<br>
freezing weather.
<br>
<p>Draining the pump and pipes if pump house and insulation not finished was
<br>
URGENT--bad consequences if not done since the pipes and pump housing tend
<br>
to break when the water inside them freezes.
<br>
<p>Collecting kindling was high priority since it's almost impossible to get a
<br>
fire going without it. This is one of those things that could have an effect
<br>
on my basic goal of surviving, so perhaps I should have even granted it
<br>
urgent status. In any event, it would have been one of the first things I
<br>
did.
<br>
<p>Reading chapter on Paleoethnobotany was high priority since it advanced one
<br>
of my major subgoals. I gave it higher priority than the pump house and
<br>
insulation, because it was certainly possible to get by without running
<br>
water for a few days--I'd done it plenty of times before.
<br>
<p>Making the apple pie was medium priority. There were other things to eat, so
<br>
it didn't impact survival and the apples would keep.
<br>
<p>The greenhouse was both urgent and high priority. There was citrus growing
<br>
in there that would provide Vitamin C throughout the winter (and winters to
<br>
come) and it could be damaged or even killed by the frost if the greenhouse
<br>
was not closed.
<br>
<p>According to the items I checked off, I got everything done that day except
<br>
the weather-stripping and firewood. If I had not listed and prioritized the
<br>
possibilities for the day, it's quite likely I would have spent the day
<br>
doing some silly thing that seemed urgent--I noted in my journal at the
<br>
beginning of the day that what I most felt like doing was staying inside and
<br>
keeping warm. I probably would have spent half the day talking on the phone
<br>
(I didn't have Internet access at the time, so email would not have been a
<br>
temptation). Some of this might have resulted in a little money coming in;
<br>
but on this particular day, building the pump house made far more sense.
<br>
<p>All this may seem a far cry from the high-tech stuff that's generally
<br>
discussed on this list, but the general principles of goal setting and goal
<br>
prioritizing apply to all human endeavors.
<br>
<p>( I can't claim credit for these ideas. I read them in a book years ago, and
<br>
unfortunately I can't remember the title or the author's name.)
