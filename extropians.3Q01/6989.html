<p>I once wrote a long silly novel.  I still have it, in MS Word.  I
<br>
could encode a message into that novel by inserting each word
<br>
of the message into the text at some random interval, then
<br>
patching the sentences around it so that the resulting text is
<br>
no more silly than the original.  Then I could encode a number
<br>
at the end, which when multiplied by your private key, would
<br>
tell you to find the 156th word, the 284th, the 416th, etc.  You
<br>
could get my message and no one could ever prove I had
<br>
encoded a message in it, nor could they endure reading my
<br>
entire silly novel to even try to find it.  Security by excruciating
<br>
boredom.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, we could use a wordspew algorithm to take my
<br>
novel and generate from it any arbitrary number of similarly
<br>
silly novels, into which messages could be encoded.  This
<br>
would of course be enormously wasteful of bandwidth, as in
<br>
Gene's 20 tons of paper example, but email is free, so who
<br>
cares?  The encryption guys will always be able to defeat
<br>
the crackers, regardless of clipper chip or otherwise.  spike
