<em>&gt; Well, first off, I want to apologize to the people who I may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have unduly upset by my post.  Some of you may be newer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the list and may not realize that one of my fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivations revolves around the question of the reduction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;Years of Potential Life Lost&quot;.  Previous posts are motivated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from that perspective.
</em><br>
<p>There is no meaningful way of calculating such a number as there
<br>
is no way of judging the value of the various individuals
<br>
involved in any particular impact and their actual and potential
<br>
impact on subsequent history effectively.  Not to mention that
<br>
it is a cold-blooded intellectual game of the worse sort.    I
<br>
think it is
<br>
far, far more important to evaluate the effect of what we
<br>
propose and do on the living, present and future than to
<br>
evaluate backward on how many who would have died (presumably
<br>
irrevocably) in some future we aim for need not die
<br>
irrevocably.  I have tried to get across before that focusing on
<br>
&quot;the dark side&quot; of these equations leads to a large possibility
<br>
of ruinious policies, pronouncements and actions and to a darker
<br>
motivation of the workers in the field themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why is this important to discuss? -- because it is precisely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the issue facing U.S. politicians today.  Whether to execute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapid indiscriminante strikes that may satisfy a need for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revenge or whether to proceed so carefully that individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who have an &quot;irrational&quot; agenda against the United States or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its citizens are able to execute further actions resulting in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a not insignificant loss of life (current news reports seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to suggest that there are still undiscovered &quot;cells&quot; in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S.).
</em><br>
<p>The need for revent is irrelevant compared to the need to
<br>
greatly reduce the potential for further actions of this kind. 
<br>
There are certainly cells of various kinds in the US.  Do you
<br>
turn the country into a police-state to find them all?  Probably
<br>
not.  Do you attempt to dry up their funding and command
<br>
structure?  More likely.  Do you go after the main training and
<br>
supply depots for such actions where you can find them.  Yes. 
<br>
Do you knock out some especially troubling and degenerate
<br>
governments who are oppressing their people and funding
<br>
terrorism? Possibly.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First I will respond to Anders:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The ethical is most serious: you assume that human lives can have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; negative value, and do an essentially utilitarian calculation not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of happiness, but simply of utility towards a certain goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anders, first, can you make a reasonable case that lives that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have as a fundamental raison d'etre the elimination of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives do not have a &quot;negative value&quot;?  Second, can you make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case that individuals who openly support or fund individuals who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have as their raison d'etre the elimination of other *innocent*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals from the planet is not of &quot;negative value&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think you can make a reasonable case for &quot;negative
<br>
value&quot; at all.  You can make a case that some lives are so rabid
<br>
and poisonous that the only sane course is to lock the
<br>
individuals away or kill them.  You can certainly make the
<br>
second case as many otherwise seeming sane and even productive
<br>
governmental groups do employ killers when they believe it is
<br>
necessary.  It is sometimes possible to change their belief or
<br>
the extent of their belief it is necessary or making doing so
<br>
too costly in consequences to leave this option open.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Bottom line for me -- lives dedicated to the destruction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other lives (or supporting the destruction of other lives)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are clearly unextropic.  So my previous post on face value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is clearly unextropic.  [NOTE THIS QUITE CAREFULLY -- I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HAVE PROPOSED A POTENTIALLY SELF-CONTRADICTORAY SOLUTION
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AND AM WELL AWARE OF THAT.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So all warriors everywhere are unextropic?  Come again?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Anders continues:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The core idea of transhumanism is human development, so that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can extend our potential immensely and become something new. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is based on the assumption that human life in whatever form it may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be (including potential successor beings) is valuable and worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something in itself. It must not be destroyed, because that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; destroys what transhumanism strives to preserve and enhance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, of course, and if my previous note is read carefully, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should seem apparent that my desire is to maximize &quot;life&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether the proposed strategy to maximize this is *really*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimal is certainly open to significant attack.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>To optimize life it is necessary to only destroy some living
<br>
beings when this is truly essential to increasing life and only
<br>
to the extent necessary.  The idea of blowing Afghanistan away
<br>
is clearly much too heavy-handed. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; However, the discussion of the fastest path to transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the broadest path to transhumanism is not something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be cast aside due to some unsavory bumps along the road.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Nuking a country until it glows because we are mad and can't
<br>
thing of a better way to handle the situation is not merely an
<br>
unsavory bump. It is an admission that we aren't ready to grow
<br>
up to any sort of posthuman status.  The broad path leads to the
<br>
destruction of us all. 
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Anders:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Even if some humans are not helpful in achieving transhumanity doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mean their existence is worthless, and if they are an active
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hindrance to your (or anybody elses) plans destroying their lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is always wrong as long as they do not initiate force against you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, but the key perspective is &quot;as long as they do not initiiate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force against you&quot;.  We are past that point.  They are initiatiating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force against us in an unextropic perspective that seems to involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the support of brain-washed individuals in Afganistan and Pakistan.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The entire country is initiating force against us?  Every single
<br>
man, woman and child?  No?  Well the government itself has
<br>
declared war on us?  No?  Then on what basis are you talking
<br>
about nuking the entire country?  
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Anders:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The logical mistake is to ignore the full consequences of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; idea, and just look at the &quot;desirable&quot; first-order consequences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What you miss is that if this form of &quot;practical genocide&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; used, then the likeliehood of other forms of &quot;practical genocide&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are becoming far higher and harder to ethically suppress, as well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as resistance to the US or other genocidal group is likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; become *far* more violent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anders, *I* did not, and it would appear the U.S. military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; officials (at least currently) are not, ignoring the potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences of bombing Islamic states.  My statements were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carefully made based on estimates that (a) a backlash would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop; (b) a response to such a backlash would be moderately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective; (c) technologies would develop that would make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire response vs. counter-response irrelevant)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Statements like &quot;or other genocidal group is likely to become *far*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more violent&quot; ignores the fact that *we* too can become *far* more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violent.
</em><br>
<p>Great.  You propose to use genocide to answer terrorism which
<br>
leads to great terrorism and possibly a full jihad which leads
<br>
to more genocide and the entire world embroiled in World War
<br>
III.  Brilliant! NOT!
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anders:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This post is going to haunt us all - it is in the archives, it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been sent to hundreds of list participants. Be assured that in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; few years, when the current uproar has settled down, somebody is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; going to drag it out and use it against extropianism in the media.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've heard this from Anders, and I've heard it from Eliezer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (as well as the not small number of messages filling my personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mailbox)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I must only say that I am shocked and amazed.  If one cannot voice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the extropian list thoughts, ideas and opinions that one has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the maximization of the evolution of our society -- then we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are doomed.  We are implicitly stating that ideas exist that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not fit for public consumption or that we would prefer the veneer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of public approval rather than the debate of rigorous, rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You can voice thoughts, etc. about what maximizes evolution. 
<br>
And you can expect to have them ripped to shreds if they lead to
<br>
a world none of us wants to live in or help build and seem quite
<br>
likely to destroy our all our dreams of tomorrow.  
<br>
<p>We are in a fishbowl here.  You can bet your ass that the
<br>
enemies of transhumanism will pick up such suggestions and
<br>
reasoning and make quite a bit of unextropic hay with them. 
<br>
There certainly are ideas that are not fit for public discussion
<br>
and will have a very, very hard time being taken as &quot;rational&quot;.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Strike me down, tear me to shreads, rip me into tiny pieces --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but never, never, never argue that my voice should not be heard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't say that.  But I will say loudly when I think you are
<br>
way out to lunch.
