<p>You could harden likely targets a bit.  Like shooting down off

course aircraft.

<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Although DMCA has nothing to do with detecting or
<br>
preventing  any sort of terrorist activity.

<p><p><em>&gt; Suggesting a Sysop is

</em><br>
<p>It is the ultimate Benevolent Dictator or at least the Cosmic
<br>
Nannie par excellence.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; remain an open society, but the cultural changes needed will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather wrenching. 
</em><br>
<p>The biggest change required is that governments be severely
<br>
limited from interfering with individual rights and with any and
<br>
all behaviors that do not directly harm or defraud others. 
<br>
Transparency is not safe unless governments are forbidden to act
<br>
on the information received to suppress unpopular attitudes and
<br>
activities or to attempt to force compliance with government
<br>
endorsed positions. 
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;Relinquishment simply doesn't work, and besides we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have enough bombs and airplanes already. We can't scatter into space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet, and besides we all need the greater human society to function
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and prosper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of these partial solutions, some appear more promising than others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The transparent society ideas of accountability and the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trace stuff would help discourage the more rational irrationalists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and might even allow the discovery of dangerous plots before they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are executed. If these traits could be combined with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-enforcing structure (legal, economic, software, whatever) that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevents abuse, much would be won. 
</em><br>
<p>But who gets to define what is and isn't abuse?  Some of the
<br>
current definitions of those in power in the US and elsewhere in
<br>
the world would lead straight to a more rigid and horrific
<br>
totalitarian state than the world has ever seen.  As long as
<br>
political theory and practice is highly irrational, our best
<br>
protection is in what privacy we have and what inefficiencies
<br>
for enforcement of government will that exist now.  I will live
<br>
(but not happily of course) with the threat of terrorism rather
<br>
than under the grim certainty of a totalitarian state.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; We need more than just the need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for court orders to bring out keys from escrow, something that can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be easily subverted by a new regime. Distributed encrypted legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smart contracts, perhaps?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The Fifth Amendment should cover the right of any and all
<br>
persons not to diverge their electronic information.  This
<br>
information should be seen as a direct extension of the person's
<br>
mind.  It should be as illegal for the court to order it open as
<br>
for the court to order truth-serum to be administered to a
<br>
defendant.  Nothing less imho will protect us as individuals as
<br>
we become more intimately augmented by electronic and
<br>
computational devices.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The risk with disasters like today is that people feel powerless and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stressed, and hence opt for the easiest solutions rather than think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of new ones.  We have a huge problem, we need to solve it, and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need a *good* solution. Otherwise this will happen again and again,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on larger and larger scales.
</em><br>
<p>I could see a more transparent society (in both directions,
<br>
public and private) with and only with severe restrictions on
<br>
government and corporate meddling with individual rights.  
<br>
<p>On today's tragedy, I wonder whether these planes were
<br>
simultaneously hijacked in a coordinated matter (difficult) or
<br>
whether the automatic guidance systems were somehow subverted
<br>
and made impervious to manula override.  Just a thought.
