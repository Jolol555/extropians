</em><br>
<p>That wasn't actually one of the Internet applications I was visualizing,
<br>
although a centralized repository of standards does make sense.  What I
<br>
expect, though, is that most of the most commonly used standards will make
<br>
appearances in standard Flare libraries and will therefore be locally
<br>
documented, with the Flare IDE being responsible for displaying the
<br>
documentation without the programmer needing to go look at the source
<br>
file.  That's 90% of the benefit.  Having a central Internet repository
<br>
for all standards, commonly used or not, is an obvious extension of this
<br>
principle which implements the remaining 10% of the functionality through
<br>
the exercise of the proverbial &quot;other 90%&quot; of the effort.
<br>
<p>Getting code that works together with &quot;drag n' drop&quot; ease is a question of
<br>
modularity and self-organization.  Modularity is very substantially
<br>
improved by annotation, or so I allege.  Self-organization is an
<br>
annotative idiom; it is permitted by allowing bindings to occur through an
<br>
intelligent search that checks the annotated metadata of linkup
<br>
candidates.  For example, imagine sending an event that targets a service
<br>
annotated with any of the keywords 'jpeg', 'image', 'graphics', 'display',
<br>
or 'window', in that order.  Imagine an object.property access that binds
<br>
to any property whose metadata is annotated with the standard keyword
<br>
'appendage'.  In general, a binding can occur if the searches and the
<br>
targets intersect at least once.  Lots of intelligent bindings on a local
<br>
scale equals self-organization on a global scale.
<br>
<p>I can personally attest that modularity is amazingly improved by the
<br>
hacked-up pseudo-annotative idioms I've been using as a substitute for
<br>
Flare.  Whether intelligent search is useful or totally useless is
<br>
something I don't know from experience; I've wished for it on one or two
<br>
occasions but have never had occasion to actually implement it, since it's
<br>
fundamentally a way of linking up code written by different programmers. 
<br>
I've used rendezvous on a single keyword to good effect, but not
<br>
intersecting sets of searches and targets - that part is purely
<br>
theoretical.  There's probably a pretty good chance that the existence of
<br>
a single unified standard for describing images will obviate the need to
<br>
try and bind to a wild-guess set of keywords.  Still, who knows, somebody
<br>
might find a use for it eventually.
