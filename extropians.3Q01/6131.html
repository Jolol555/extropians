<em>&gt; As some of my posts to the list over the years have shown one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; big problems I think we will face in the future is &quot;trustability&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do you trust that you will not be betrayed and/or damaged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by other entities whose inner workings you cannot verify.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, in memory of today's sad events I would like to challenge the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of the Extropian community to think long and hard about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what ways might be used to create innovative solutions to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism that would increase trustability and personal security
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without imposing restrictions on freedoms (in other words, please,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please lets not make it a debate about guns).
</em><br>
<p>I promise. This is an issue which impacts, but is not dependent upon
<br>
guns.
<br>
<p>The issue is that posited by the Joker in Batman I: &quot;Who do you trust?
<br>
Hubba Hubba.. Who do you trust?&quot;
<br>
<p>The primary problem of trust in this world is that we are not a one
<br>
world society. We are many societies, each of which has its own internal
<br>
trust quotient toward individuals and the state. We cannot, therefore,
<br>
expect to be able to automatically trust others outside of our
<br>
societies. There does need to be trustability verification on this
<br>
score, but this does not mean that individuals within a society should
<br>
be treated as foreigners by their government. As it stands, here in the
<br>
US, our primary weakness is that we do not discriminate in our
<br>
trustability between citizen and alien. This failure results in us
<br>
trusting fellow citizens too little, resulting in social strife and
<br>
creeping domestic fascism, and in trusting foreigners too much, too
<br>
easily, resulting the security weaknesses we saw exploited in today's
<br>
attacks.
<br>
<p>The security hole that was exploited, I believe, is that terrorist
<br>
pilots were able to penetrate airport security at four airports, with
<br>
two airlines who have demonstrated the weakest security practices. These
<br>
airlines subcontract their security to two security companies, who are
<br>
responsible for hiring and background checks to hire security personnel
<br>
working for $7.00 an hour in positions of great responsibility. It most
<br>
certainly required at least four moles working in security to allow
<br>
these individuals access to the airliners (and potentially only one)
<br>
<p>I think the solution to this is to hold United and American Airlines, as
<br>
well as the two security companies, and the airports from which the
<br>
airplanes flew from, financially responsible for the damages of today's
<br>
attacks, for their negligence in ensuring the security of their
<br>
airlines. The pressure of this financial impact will most certainly
<br>
force all other airlines to beef their security up to professional
<br>
levels.
