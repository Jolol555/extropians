<p>I would beg to differ. I suggest you look at some stats first. It
<br>
doesn't matter how many people participate either, it is the accident
<br>
rates that matter. 
<br>
<p>It also follows logically: an archer shoots arrows at a target from
<br>
behind a firing line that is not to be crossed by anyone, while a tennis
<br>
player swings their racket toward another person, with spectators along
<br>
the side.
<br>
<p>Then there is my perrenial favorite: bathtubs versus handguns.... which
<br>
do you think is safer, and which do you think is regulated more in their
<br>
manufacture, sale, and use....
