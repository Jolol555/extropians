<p>
&nbsp;From another list:-
<br>
<p>Libertarian Author's definition:
<br>
God. A being recognizable as human or humanoid but
<br>
with a vastly broader experience, capabilities, knowledge,
<br>
field of volitional choice than is possible for human beings
<br>
as we understand the biology and psychology of that species;
<br>
an emergent consciousness of some aspect of existence
<br>
other than life as we know it; immortal (not only without end
<br>
but possibly without beginning) and possibly indestructible;
<br>
possibly capable of volitional action apart from the space-time
<br>
continuum as we experience it; possibly the designer and
<br>
first cause of our world as we know it, particularly ourselves.
<br>
<p>Mann:
<br>
The fact that anyone can provide a string of words to &quot;define&quot;
<br>
words like &quot;phlogiston&quot; and &quot;ooblegoob&quot; does not, in my
<br>
opinion, raise the words above the level of gibberish.
<br>
<p>&quot;God. A being recognizable...&quot;
<br>
How do you perform this recognition? Have you done so?
<br>
<p>Libertarian Author:
<br>
Yeah. I met him. Now what are you gonna say, bigshot?
<br>
<p>Mann:
<br>
This may be a flippant response. If it's a serious response,
<br>
then I think many, including myself, would doubt it's
<br>
veracity. It's also possible that it's a serious response
<br>
and you believe it to be true, but you were seeing
<br>
&quot;faces in the clouds&quot; as suggested in 'Faces in the
<br>
Clouds: A New Theory of Religion' by Stewart Guthrie
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195098919/qid=988736874/sr=1-1/ref">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195098919/qid=988736874/sr=1-1/ref</a>= 
<br>
sc_b_2/107-3519305-4017345&gt;.
<br>
<p>The problem with the above &quot;definition&quot; can be summarized
<br>
with, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; What evidence do you have
<br>
for &quot;vastly broader experience, capabilities, knowledge, field of
<br>
volitional choice than is possible for human beings?&quot; If
<br>
someone hypothesizes the existence of &quot;phlogiston,&quot; you
<br>
would ask him what evidence he has for his hypothesis, or
<br>
what would be explained by it that isn't now explained. What
<br>
are you talking about when you say &quot;first cause?&quot; Your
<br>
&quot;definition&quot; seems like gibberish to me.
<br>
<p>Libertarian Author:
<br>
I will refrain from turning your debating tactics on you and
<br>
suggesting that your disbelief is psychologically motivated
<br>
by some to be discovered fear.
<br>
<p>Mann:
<br>
What &quot;disbelief&quot; have I expressed? My point is that when someone
<br>
uses words like &quot;god,&quot; etc., I ask, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;
<br>
All I've heard in response has been gibberish to me. Nothing has
<br>
been said to me in these respects that warrants either belief or
<br>
disbelief. If someone says to me, &quot;Ooblegoob truxyon magder.&quot;
<br>
nothing has been said that warrants either belief or disbelief.
<br>
<p>There is a basic human error called &quot;hypostatization&quot; -- it's a
<br>
semantic and ontological error of assuming that because some
<br>
humans use a particular word (or phrase) that the word has (or
<br>
might have) a referent; in other words, the error of assuming that
<br>
because people use a word, it stands for or refers to something.
<br>
<p>Mr. K:
<br>
Other than the fact that I HAVE met and discoursed with both
<br>
Atheists and Theists with coherent definitions of God, I agree
<br>
with the rest of your argument.
<br>
<p>There is an element in your argument, a presumption
<br>
if you will, that one cannot present a coherent definition
<br>
of certain postulations.
<br>
<p>Mann:
<br>
No. That's not my position. What I've been saying is
<br>
that the word &quot;god&quot; is gibberish to me because I know
<br>
of no evidence for it having any referent, and when I
<br>
ask people to tell me what they're talking about when
<br>
they use the word &quot;god,&quot; they've so far responded with
<br>
what turns out (sometimes after further questioning)
<br>
to be gibberish to me.
<br>
<p>I don't exclude the possibility that some day someone
<br>
will respond with something other than gibberish.
<br>
<p>So, let's put it to another test. Provide some &quot;coherent
<br>
definitions of God.&quot; Maybe you'll surprise me by providing
<br>
logical and rational responses when I question the words
<br>
(particularly what referents they might have) you use in
<br>
your &quot;definitions.&quot;
<br>
<p>Libertarian Author:
<br>
I gave you a clear definition of God. I've written nine
<br>
books, have been published by magazines ranging
<br>
from the Economist, National Review, the New York
<br>
Times, Reader's Digest, and libertarian publications
<br>
ranging from Murray Rothbard's Libertarian Forum to
<br>
Liberty, New Libertarian, and Reason and won awards
<br>
for my writing. I've made a special study of epistemology.
<br>
I daresay I'm in a better position to define gibberish than
<br>
you are and in case you haven't noticed, by calling the
<br>
definition I gave you gibberish you just called me an idiot.
<br>
<p>Mann:
<br>
No. You may be a genius at aspects of epistemology, and a
<br>
remarkably skilled, competent, and successful author, however
<br>
it's unlikely that your knowledge and understanding are perfect
<br>
in all other areas, maybe such as ontology, semantics, and
<br>
logic (maybe only when you get emotional). I most definitely
<br>
did not call you an idiot, and I never will. That is not my style.
<br>
Because of all the potential sources of human error, some
<br>
of which I haven't mentioned yet, no matter how brilliant we
<br>
are in some areas and at certain times, we (at least humans
<br>
I've been in contact with) are still prone to at least the occasional
<br>
error in other areas and at other times.
<br>
<p>The fact that a brilliant man occasionally errs, definitely does
<br>
not warrant calling him an idiot and I would never do so.
<br>
<p>Mr. K:
<br>
*Sigh* O.K., let's test that counterclaim. Here's what I consider
<br>
a coherent definition of &quot;god&quot; actually in common use among a
<br>
certain, reasonably large, group of people*: a reasoning (or, if you
<br>
prefer, thinking) entity superior in intelligence and physical power
<br>
to any and all existing human beings.
<br>
<p>Please explain to me how that definition is either incoherent or
<br>
gibberish.
<br>
<p>Mann:
<br>
Suppose we use Einstein's intelligence as a unit of &quot;one Einstein&quot;
<br>
and Schwarzenegger's physical power as a unit of &quot;one
<br>
Schwarzenegger.&quot; Suppose a few of us were to develop the
<br>
technology to enhance our intelligence and power, and transform
<br>
ourselves into transhumans or posthumans with 10 Einsteins
<br>
and 10 Schwarzeneggers. We would be &quot;gods,&quot; satisfying your
<br>
coherent definition.
<br>
<p>We could speculate how to do this: a portable supercomputer
<br>
hooked to our brains, appendages powered by a &quot;portable
<br>
power pack&quot; added to our arms and legs that effectively make
<br>
us physically much more powerful.
<br>
<p>You have indeed responded with a definition of &quot;god&quot;
<br>
that is coherent and not gibberish.
<br>
<p>Frederick Mann
