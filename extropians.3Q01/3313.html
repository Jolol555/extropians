<p><em>&gt; I don't recall there ever being a self-identified black person on this

<p>It would be a shame if *anyone* with a good mind and with something that he
<br>
or she wanted to contribute  felt that they could not reasonably participate.
<br>
There isn't any reason limit what you are saying to any special group.
<br>
<p>One very lovely thing is that on email lists one's race or weight or
<br>
nicotine addiction need not arouse the immediate and usually harmful
<br>
reactions that people all too often have, for example,  &quot;Ugh!  He's
<br>
a smoker&quot;, or &quot;Ugh. She's a woman!&quot;, or &quot;Ugh. He's fat.&quot;, or &quot;Ugh.
<br>
She's asian.&quot;   Let us pause for a moment to express sympathy for
<br>
the people possessed of such harmful reactions (in addition, of course,
<br>
to the usual sympathy for the targets of their reactions).  In some
<br>
cases, racists or woman-haters or those who hate smokers or despise
<br>
the overweight *cannot* help it.  They have not yet achieved sufficient
<br>
control over their reactions (in those cases where they even want to).
<br>
<p>It is a very good thing that people do *not* feel obligated to reveal
<br>
their race, sexual orientation, weight, or drug habits on discussion
<br>
lists.  I sincerely hope that you are not asking that they do so.
