<p><em>&gt; Anyone who thinks you can run a conscious personality on a

</em><br>
<p>Could be!!  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Off topic, but glancing at your other e-mail, I'm damned if I know what to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make of Donna Haraway and other such &quot;cyborg&quot; or &quot;posthuman&quot; theorists. To 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me, they're barking up the wrong tree, not realising that the important 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues for the new century relate to the *literal* possibilities of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhancement, extreme longevity, etc. All this stuff about the cyborg as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of analogue or symbol for the identity politics of feminism, gay rights 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc, is beside the point.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it's pretty unbelievable how poor some people's understanding of these
<br>
issues is.  Katherine Hayles, in her book, &quot;How We Became Posthuman&quot;, writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was reading Hans Moravec's &quot;Mind Children&quot;... when I happened upon a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passage where he argues it will soon be possible to download human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscioiusness into a computer.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; How, I asked myself, was it possible for someone of Moravec's obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence to believe that mind could be separated from body?
</em><br>
<p>Ninety percent of her book addresses the question &quot;What do gendered bodies
<br>
have to do with the erasure of embodiment and the subsequent merging of
<br>
machine and human intelligence in the figure of the cyborg?&quot;
<br>
<p>As humorous as a lot of the postmodernist writing is in this book---with
<br>
sentences unexpectedly swerving into a denunciation of capitalism or jutting
<br>
into stark eroticism---the extent of the disconnect between where some of these
<br>
people are and where materialists are is awesome.  An enormous chasm has
<br>
silently opened between the people raised in the computer and scientific
<br>
culture of the 1960's, and the literary crowd, to the point that the latter
<br>
simply cannot understand the former.  And this is *not* the two cultures of
<br>
C. P. Snow, whatever the historical linkage.  That old split had to do with
<br>
literary people not *appreciating* science.  This has to do with the
<br>
development of a completely different mindset on philosophical issues.
