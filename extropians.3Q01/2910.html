<em>&gt; &gt; My own view of &quot;reparations&quot; is that making me pay for the crimes

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; descendents of the slaves responsible.  I have no more control

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some of us who oppose reparations fail, I think, to fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take into account one of the chief arguments of those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do.  As one of them explained, recently, it's not so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals, or perhaps even racial groups, that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want held accountable.  They want entire *nations*, i.e.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the collective state that to them is the legitimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embodiment of &quot;the people&quot; to be held accountable.  Quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few libertarians easily forget that collectivists really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do see states and nations not only as valid abstractions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which I do too) but as extremely necessary and very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vital entities that in many ways are better, wiser, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more just than the mere individuals of a region.
</em><br>
<p>I fully understand this, and is the main reason why I am opposed to
<br>
reparations, unless of course, I get to sue the British government for
<br>
recovery of the family land and property in Scotland....
<br>
<p>I suppose next they'll want to sue people based on their religion too...
<br>
since it was those WASPs who did all the enslaving, and their
<br>
episcopalian churches all rationalized it. Then I suppose the native
<br>
americans will sue Spain for paying Columbus to discover the new
<br>
world...
