<p>Well, why do you think they would save money?  The medical profession.
<br>
like any other, charges whatever the market will bear.  Tumor removal,
<br>
whether at stage 2 or stage 4, is something that even if the charges
<br>
go up, the market will not change that much.
<br>
Why would finding a tumor 2 months earlier save the insurance cos  any
<br>
money in the long run? So if the hospitals/doctors can no longer get
<br>
on average 45K for a tumor because X percentage of tumors are now at
<br>
stage 2 instead of stage 4, then hospitals/doctors just increase the
<br>
price for stage 2 tumor removals.  They have the money to buy
<br>
corp-gov-media and so the status quo will not change...
<br>
<p>### Removing a tumor at stage 2 frequently results in a cure or a prolonged
<br>
remission, during which the patient continues to pay insurance premiums.
<br>
There is much less morbidity from complications, the hospital stay and
<br>
additional therapy (chemo, radiotherapy) is usually not needed, overall cost
<br>
is lower. In the long run the insurance wins because they have a
<br>
(relatively) healthy patient staying longer on their policy, even if later
<br>
other problems eventually kill the patient. Of course, the ideal patient
<br>
(from the insurance point of view) is perfectly healthy until age 90, then
<br>
suddenly drops dead.
<br>
<p>Hospitals can't just increase the price for a procedure because a large
<br>
fraction of their patients are covered by Medicare, with the HCFA setting
<br>
reimbusement levels - no matter what you charge, you will only get what the
<br>
HCFA thinks they need to give you. And very few health care providers can
<br>
afford to drop their Medicare patients and still survive.
<br>
<p>Private insurance companies have also their pre-set reimbursement levels and
<br>
raising prices won't change them. It takes a powerful institution with a
<br>
good bargaining position to force them to adjust reimbursements. The other
<br>
method is dropping plans which give especially low reimbursements but only
<br>
the best institutions in any area can do such cherry-picking.
<br>
<p>You would need almost unlimited funds to buy &quot;corp&quot;  *and*  &quot;gov&quot;  *and*
<br>
&quot;media&quot;.
