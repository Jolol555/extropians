</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Good point, but the example is odd (I say after the briefest visit to Dr
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Plantinga's homepage).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is an exaggeration to say that Plantinga is single-handedly responsible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for making Christian analytic philosophy academically respectable. What is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surpising is how small of an exaggeration it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Regard this strange assertion:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ========================
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A letter from Plantinga, a philosophy professor, and Huston Smith, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; religion professor at Berkeley, moved the National Association of Biology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Teachers to remove anti-religious language from its statement on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For years, the association's official position read: &quot;The diversity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on earth is the outcome of evolution: an unsupervised, impersonal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unpredictable and natural process.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Recently, after Plantinga and Smith objected that &quot;unsupervised&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;impersonal&quot; go beyond scientific  evidence, the association dropped those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; words.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;I was a little surprised, actually, but I was very pleased,&quot; says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Plantinga, a member of South Bend Christian Reformed Church who came to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Notre Dame from Calvin College in Grand Rapids, 15 years ago. &quot;It's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but significant little thing in the whole debate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;There is so much heat in this area -- people's faith, people's ideology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; involved-- that often straightforward, rational discussion doesn't work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; well.&quot; Plantinga and Smith are among a growing number of Christian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scholars, including scientists, who challenge what they consider the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unscientific presuppositions of modern culture with respect to evolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;I think the main thing to see about it is that it is by no means merely a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientific doctrine at all,&quot; Plantinga says. &quot;It is about naturalism vs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theism, naturalism vs. American religious belief, naturalism vs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christianity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;They think science has shown that human beings are not really created by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; God. That's not true at all. That's not science. That's theology. It's bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theology because it's theology confused with science.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's the point he and Smith argued successfully about the biology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; association's position.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;A good bit of it was theology, not science,&quot; Plantinga says. &quot;There's no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; way, simply on the basis of physical science, that you could have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discovered that the process is unsupervised or impersonal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;That's not part of evolutionary theory as science at all. We wondered why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it was stated as a piece of science.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Unlike those who object to evolutionary theories on religious grounds,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Plantinga and others do not insist that the Genesis account of creation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; must be taken literally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;I'm somebody who thinks God created the world,&quot; Plantinga says. &quot;I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sure that's what the Lord intends to teach in that part of Genesis. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know exactly how he did it. It's possible he did it by evolution.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ==================================
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So the bacteria changing rapidly in human bodies within the span of a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decades might be doing so *under the personal supervision of a deity*? Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is it under the personal supervision of the devil?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think Plantinga's view is that God has different levels of involvement:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God might be happy to let the clock of nature wind-down on its own for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most part while occassionally interceding for the occassion miracle, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showstopper like Jesus. Thus, it is consistent with his view that Bacteria
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might evolve in humans without God directly supervising this process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Cf. his whimsical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; definition:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt; alvinize, v. To stimulate protracted discussion by making a bizarre
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; claim. &quot;His contention that natural evil is due to Satanic agency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alvinized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; his listeners.&quot; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just to be clear, this is not his own definition of himself, it is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dennett's humour book.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I assume Dr Alvin P. does find this a bizarre assertion;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a little unfair, or at least misleading. Remember the definition is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meant to be humorous. This is a little complicated but I will try to boil it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down: Plantinga wrote a free will defence in response to the problem of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evil. He was responding to the charge that there is a logical contradiction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between the assertion that God exists and the presence of evil in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world. He takes the point of a theodicy (he calls it a 'defense') to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrate the (mere) logical POSSIBILITY that God and evil might exist. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the course of this discussion Plantinga suggested that it is POSSIBLE that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural evil (earth quakes, etc.) are the result of Satanic agency. I agree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is possible. It just seems to me that it is highly improbable. But this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not affect the logic of Plantiga's argument. One of the most common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticisms of Plantinga free will defence is that it does not go far enough:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a theodicy should explain why God allows evil, not simply say that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logically possible. (I actually think that his defense doesn't allow him to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wriggle out of the contradiction).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I regard his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assertion--that we might any longer regard stochastic evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; processes as under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the guiding hand of a god--exactly as ridiculous. I'm ashamed that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; National Association of Biology Teachers caved in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was suprised they caved in. But then again, there are a surprising number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of religious scientist. I think I read some stats on this in the last few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years. Perhaps it was in Scientific American. (I only read that rag in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grocery store line-up).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But maybe Dr Plantinga has more intelligent things to say elsewhere. Got a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specific paper you'd recommend, Mark?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, just read his entire corpus. I think you can get a reasonable idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his views on evolution from the following:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I saw him give a version of this talk &quot;An Evolutionary Argument Against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Naturalism&quot; (I wish the full thing was available)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://hisdefense.org/articles/ap001.html">http://hisdefense.org/articles/ap001.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a couple of years ago at the Canadian Philosophical Association where he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gave the Plenary address. (He was very funny. The guy that introduced him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rambled off 18 prestigious universities where Plantinga has been a &quot;visiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinguished professor&quot;. Plantinga got up and the first thing he said was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that being at 18 universities makes it sound like he couldn't hold down a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; job).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (Or am I missing a meta-point, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you're poking fun at this `luminary'?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, you are not. We know (or more judiciously, believe) that Plantinga's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion is false. So either the logic of his argument is faulty, or one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or more premise is false. Since Plantinga is pretty handy with logic, our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best bet is that we disagree about the premises. But, having said this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plantinga seems to me as rational as any atheist I know (and in fact, more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so than most atheists that I know). My point is that to say that religion is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational because some or even many of its adherents are not as rational as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they might be does not show that all adherents must be. This is the strategy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of arguing &quot;guilt by association&quot;--something that first year of uni is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed to help us get over.  I am not particularly bothered by the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that many of those who are less than ideally (humanly) rational--perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through no fault of their own--believe in the religious hypothesis, indeed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is perhaps quite understandable. It is when I see enormously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectually gifted philosophers and scientists believing in the religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I am unsettled. For then the hypothesis that it must be a failure of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality on their part looks a lot more questionable. Mark.
