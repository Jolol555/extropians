<br>
<p>Abstract: Turnpikes promised a solution to the problem of bad roads, but
<br>
private management of highways was a startling innovation. Some people
<br>
opposed the idea and denounced turnpikes with the betes noires of &quot;private
<br>
corporation&quot; and &quot;aristocracy.&quot; Much of the controversy, however, was rooted
<br>
in local disputes over concessions. The legislature both expressed and
<br>
responded to turnpike protest by writing laws favorable to local users and
<br>
damaging to the financial viability of the companies. Turnpikes were
<br>
unprofitable, and their potential as a service to the entire community was
<br>
not fully realized.

<p>&quot;The Voluntary Provision of Public Goods?  The Turnpike Companies of Early

America&quot; at:

<br>
<p>Abstract: The turnpike companies of early America (roughly 1795-1840) were
<br>
very unprofitable but conferred vast benefits to communities served.
<br>
Purchasing stock was like paying for the road since such purchases were
<br>
necessary to complete the road and unprofitability was foreseen. Thus the
<br>
turnpikes would appear to have been public goods. Yet hundreds of turnpikes
<br>
were provided through voluntary association. The free rider problem was
<br>
overcome by an almost vigilant impulse to participate and to see that your
<br>
neighbor did likewise.
<br>
<p>&quot;Use, Esteem, and Profit in Voluntary Provision: Toll Roads in California,
<br>
1850-1902&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://lsb.scu.edu/~dklein/papers/caTollRds.html">http://lsb.scu.edu/~dklein/papers/caTollRds.html</a>
<br>
<p>Abstract: With county and state government unable to effect road
<br>
improvement, California lawmakers immediately opened the field to private
<br>
initiative. At least 159 private companies successfully built and operated
<br>
toll roads in California. Compared to earlier toll roads in the eastern U.
<br>
S., the California roads were concentrated in ownership and more
<br>
profit-oriented in operation. Even so, the quest for mere road improvement
<br>
was often also an important impetus for taking toll road stock. Voluntary
<br>
association assumed the corporate form to achieve its several goals.
<br>
<p>The above, of course, deal with roads and not other so called public goods.
<br>
However, similar cases can be made for other cases too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is not an argument for big government, which can be opposed on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various bases, just a view that there is no knock-out argument in favour
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; minarchy. I think it can be shown that any pure minarchist position such
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; Jerry Mitchell seems to be advocating collapses into either anarchism or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classical liberalism, once a serious attempt is made to defend it.
</em><br>
<p>I thought the classical liberal position was minarchism.
<br>
<p>One should look at the evidence and the arguments.  The point is not to
<br>
persuade every last person that something is true or valid, but to see if it
<br>
is indeed true or valid.  A lot of arguments against freedom amount to
<br>
coming up with some off the wall case of why government needs to control or
<br>
prohibit something usually based on faulty reasoning or bad data.  (See,
<br>
e.g., Kevin Dowd's work on free banking, especially his _Laissez-Faire
<br>
Banking_, which is almost a decade old now.  Central bank proponents have
<br>
not really knocked down his data or logic.  Instead, they generally avoid
<br>
them.  i'm not saying they're consciously doing so, but they avoiding it
<br>
nonetheless, for the most part.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do think there is something damn close to a knock-out argument against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passing laws based on the reasoning that &quot;we don't want you to exercise
</em><br>
your
<br>
<em>&gt; freedom in certain ways that we find immoral&quot;. That, however, is a
</em><br>
classical
<br>
<em>&gt; liberal view, not strictly a libertarian one.
</em><br>
<p>What is the difference between classical liberalism and libertarianism?  I
<br>
think the two share a lot of common ground.  In fact, I daresay libertarians
<br>
are the direct descendants of classical liberals.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
