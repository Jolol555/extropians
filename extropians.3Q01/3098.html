Mike Lorrey said
<br>
<p><em>   &gt; Well, my personal opinion is that education is the prime problem, and 
</em><br>
the prime solution. The common saying among black kids today is that 'books 
<br>
are for whites'. That sort of racial/cultural aversion to
<br>
knowledge and learning to me seems to be the prime contributor to the
<br>
vicious cycle of poverty, crime, and hate.
<br>
<p><p>Mike, that seems a fair enough comment. I think at one point you said that 
<br>
you'd be prepared to accept public investment in education as an exception 
<br>
to your libertarian views against taxes and public expenditure, but I may be 
<br>
misrepresenting you. Remind me what you think about this (it's not a problem 
<br>
for me because I don't believe in absolute property rights, but let's not 
<br>
get into that).
<br>
<p>I also tend to think that knowledge and learning is the key, and you're
<br>
right that it's not *just* poverty. It's poverty, under-education,
<br>
partly-justified social resentment, and culture-specific memes about
<br>
appropriate attitudes to society, all in a vicious circle. But how do we 
<br>
best turn the key? What limitations do you think your political philosophy 
<br>
imposes (I'm not disputing your philosophy at this point, just asking a 
<br>
question)?
<br>
<p>Note: I do not believe in reparations in the sense of simply handing
<br>
government money to people of particular racial descent. I *do* support
<br>
economically efficient (if this is possible) public expenditures to address 
<br>
the structural issues of racially skewed poverty and under-education. In my 
<br>
local context, I would even support increased taxes for this purpose *if* I 
<br>
thought the money would be spent efficiently and effectively. I suspect that 
<br>
this would also be the position of the other 
<br>
semi-libertarians/non-libertarians floating around here, but I obviously 
<br>
can't speak for them.
