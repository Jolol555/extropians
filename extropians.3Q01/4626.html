</em><br>
<p><p>Last time this topic came up, I started reading up on the history of
<br>
education in the U.S. and basically came to the conclusion that public
<br>
education is a bad idea.  The nice part is that we have a fair amount of
<br>
historical data to prove it, since the very first state to adopt public
<br>
education was Massachusetts in 1850 and there are lots of good records
<br>
preceding that for at least a century.
<br>
<p>As Alexis de Tocqueville noted many times, the early Americans were probably
<br>
the most literate and best educated people in the world at that time, that
<br>
the average hard-working American was frequently as well-educated as the
<br>
upper class in most parts of Europe.  While the deep frontier only had a
<br>
literacy rate of around 65%, virtually all the settled regions had literacy
<br>
rates in excess of 90%.  In some locales, literacy rates were in the 98-99%
<br>
range.  It is ironic that the first state to adopt public education,
<br>
Massachusetts, has a lower literacy rate today than when they had when they
<br>
adopted public education in the middle of the 19th century.
<br>
<p>When private schools were the only option, there was fierce competition that
<br>
made high-quality cheap education available to essentially everyone.  The
<br>
market accommodated every level of society, from the very rich to the very
<br>
poor, such that no one missed out on an education by the lack of resources.
<br>
Education was viewed as an essential social good, but society supported this
<br>
through the private market rather than through public institutions.  The
<br>
problems started when the states decided that public education was a good
<br>
idea.  Because the &quot;free&quot; education was subsidized with taxes, the vast
<br>
majority of private schools at all levels of the market went bankrupt within
<br>
a decade of the adoption of public education.  In virtually every case, the
<br>
adoption of public education was followed by a rapid drop in literacy rates
<br>
and education in general, drops that in many cases have persisted to this
<br>
day.
<br>
<p>After doing some research a while back, I basically went from agnostic to
<br>
being firmly in the anti-public school camp.  The track record of public
<br>
education in this country has been disasterous for the most part, but the
<br>
problem is that so many people are used to sucking off the government teat
<br>
that they are unwilling to exercise their right to something better.
