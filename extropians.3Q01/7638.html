FYI I changed the thread title cause I don't think this
<br>
sort of exchange is appropriate to a person's personal
<br>
health choices. Best to Natasha, good to hear your
<br>
winning ma'am!.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;HMOs and insurance companies could reasonably want to see monitoring

<br>
&lt;Well, why do you think they would save money?  The medical profession.
<br>
like any other, charges whatever the market will bear.  Tumor removal,
<br>
whether at stage 2 or stage 4, is something that even if the charges
<br>
go up, the market will not change that much.
<br>
Why would finding a tumor 2 months earlier save the insurance cos  any
<br>
money in the long run? So if the hospitals/doctors can no longer get
<br>
on average 45K for a tumor because X percentage of tumors are now at
<br>
stage 2 instead of stage 4, then hospitals/doctors just increase the
<br>
price for stage 2 tumor removals.  They have the money to buy
<br>
corp-gov-media and so the status quo will not change...&gt;
<br>
<p>Tiberius,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously you don't work in health care.  I can imagine a
<br>
Health Care Administrator absolutely *salivating* at the thought
<br>
of having a stock of &quot;insured lives&quot; who had these sorts of
<br>
biometrics.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mistake #1 : The &quot;medical profession&quot;. Incorrect. This should
<br>
read &quot;medical professionS&quot; (doctors and nurses), plus &quot;allied
<br>
health care professionals&quot; (all the techs, the audiologists, the
<br>
physical therapists etc. etc.), plus the &quot;ancillary support personnel&quot;
<br>
(medical social workers that sort of thing) PLUS the &quot;straight&quot;
<br>
administrator types (Health care admin is a huge faction, and
<br>
they run herd on all that frigging paper..gods..ugh).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So you can't think in terms of a monolith. When you think of
<br>
doctors or similar &quot;providers of healthcare&quot; (clinical nurse
<br>
specialists or physican assistants) i.e. the people who &quot;see and treat
<br>
patients&quot; they are NOT absolutely NOT the ones writing the
<br>
bill you pay. Most of the time the fee structure is largely determined
<br>
by a complex negotiation process based on a mythical &quot;average&quot;
<br>
patient and an &quot;average cost of a given procedure&quot; and the
<br>
parties doing the dickering up in Admin are usually insurance
<br>
guys/gals (usually straight suits or beancounters) and some of
<br>
the high level social work type bureacrats (the Medicare people).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you say that the &quot;The medical profession.
<br>
like any other, charges whatever the market will bear&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;You made mistake #2.
<br>
&nbsp;Mistake #2. Docters are usually not their own bosses. They work
<br>
for other people, or large companies, or else their fee structure is
<br>
essentially determined FOR them by the insurance plans and HMOs
<br>
(or the Medicare system, or the hospital coallition) and all these parties
<br>
determine their fees based on what everyone ELSE is doing.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The system is ostentensibly set up to minimize expenditure on
<br>
patient care (and as a side effect maximizes administrative costs LOL).
<br>
So ANYTHING that generates mucho paperwork, &amp; can be thought
<br>
to minimize the cost outlay neccessary to keep those &quot;insured lives&quot;
<br>
from suing in large numbers will be thoughtfully considered.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am a hungry young health admin type, itching to make my
<br>
divisions fiscal year stats impressive... I'd love to have patients
<br>
with a biometric. I'd save money six different ways.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;First off I'd get Stage two tumors instead of stage 4s.  Even
<br>
if the doc lost money on a simpler operation I'd gain bottom
<br>
line. Hospitalization and complication costs would be lower.
<br>
The less ICD-9 codes the MD rings up on a given casefile
<br>
the better.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd likely keep them out of the hospital and keep them in
<br>
outpatient clinics more by ostentensibly providing more
<br>
&quot;comphrensive care&quot; (*HCA_PArthenon* Even when
<br>
your at home, HCAP is ALWAYS looking out for your
<br>
health&quot;!!!)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;#3. Patient compliance. The &quot;hard cases&quot; (usually older
<br>
with multiple serious medical conditions) are notoriously bad
<br>
about taking their meds, their insulin, violating their diets etc.
<br>
Biometrics make it easier to lower ER and inpatient
<br>
costs by keeping the hard cases on maintaince regimens
<br>
outside the hospital wards.
<br>
#4. Provide more data for my physicans to use. Data is
<br>
good. Data and lots of it provide mucho ammo against
<br>
threats of non-standard care and malpractice.
<br>
#5. Patients love to worry about stuff. They also love
<br>
to feel virtous. Placebo effect. Enough said.
<br>
#6. It takes control away from physican providers. If
<br>
I'm an admin type I want as little &quot;God-complex&quot; as
<br>
possible for my MDs and DOs.  This makes it easier
<br>
to turn the screws on THEIR paychecks next year.
<br>
simply put, anything that can be used to lower costs
<br>
will be.
<br>
And that's how it works in the real world,
<br>
cosmos help us.
<br>
<p>Brian
