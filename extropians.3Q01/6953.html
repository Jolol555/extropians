<p>
The words below are from an 80 year old man whose intelligence and curiosity
<br>
about the world, combined with a life spent living in many different
<br>
countries, make his words worth reading. He spent several years working at a
<br>
job for which he had to make weekly flights over Afghanistan. (the questions
<br>
below are mine)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Question: How would be the best way to defeat, say, the Taliban in
</em><br>
Afghanistan?
<br>
<p>Answer: the unarmed general populace have no voice in the matter.  The
<br>
Taliban has a near monopoly in weapons and supplies since the collapse of
<br>
the Russian economy.  The Russians supported the once stronger Massood
<br>
group, but not well and not enough.  So the Taliban forces will remain in
<br>
control until and if the Massood group is better supplied than the Taliban.
<br>
They have continued to fight a rear guard action for years, but have
<br>
gradually been forced back so they now control only five percent of the
<br>
country, i.e. the end closest to Russia.  Massood, incidentally, was
<br>
assassinated a few days ago, according to his aide, by a Taliban agent.  Too
<br>
bad, he was a charismatic type who was a competent tactician---you need that
<br>
for a military buildup and he will be difficult to replace.  Don't know who
<br>
his successor will be---it is possible he will come from one of the smaller
<br>
groups with a reputation for competence.
<br>
<p>There are mountain caves---more often a jumble of rock to serve the same
<br>
purpose.  They are defensible against sporadic, unsustained attack by
<br>
similarly equipped foot soldiers.  If, as they will be, the attackers are
<br>
more numerous, better equipped, better supplied, and with air cover, caves
<br>
become death traps.  Escaping detection with modern sensor equipment and
<br>
night vision is nearly impossible in a barren rock environment or thin tree
<br>
cover.  GPS coordinates will be quickly established to guide artillery and
<br>
laser-guided missiles. After the first few days of combat, lack of food,
<br>
lack of water and fatigue become important factors for defenders with
<br>
precarious or non-existent resupply.  Scrambling about over precipitous
<br>
mountains takes an enormous toll of energy and constant attack saps morale.
<br>
Given a choice I would at present rather be among attackers than the
<br>
relatively immobile defenders of caves and rocks.  And no one should forget
<br>
the climate becomes bitterly cold up in the mountains.  Fires of any kind
<br>
attract the attention of infra-red sensors followed by live ammunition. The
<br>
heat radiated by a body will do the same thing at somewhat closer range. It
<br>
is easy to freeze to death in Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>Supplies for defenders have to be carried in on foot at night, and unlike a
<br>
decade back, night provides little more concealment than midday sun.
<br>
Anything that can be seen can be targeted and destroyed.  Attacking troops
<br>
will be supplied by air from the nearest forward supply dump. It is safe to
<br>
assume the defenders will have Kalashnikovs, light machine guns, mortars,
<br>
some light anti-aircraft missile launchers, no radar, and just in case, a
<br>
few anti-tank rockets.  There will undoubtedly be a few tanks deployed
<br>
around staging areas, but not for purposes of attack in high reaches of
<br>
mountainous territory.  There will be some loss of aircraft, probably
<br>
helicopters since jets cannot loiter over a target.  Not many though, and
<br>
with their firepower they will exact a fearful toll on small groups in their
<br>
way.
<br>
<p>U.S. forces have not encountered this type of fighting since WWII, but then
<br>
every army had mountain troops, though in areas with heavier precipitation,
<br>
travelled on skis.  I was attached to a British unit at Myohaung, Burma,
<br>
comprised of British, West African and Gurkha troops who were attacking a
<br>
mountain which commanded north-south traffic along the coast and a large
<br>
river inland.  I do not remember it having any natural caves, but it was
<br>
honeycombed by artificial ones constructed by the Japanese occupants.
<br>
<p>I was supposed to be flying a Spitfire or Hurricane, but for what appeared
<br>
to be valid reasons chose a P-40---turned out to be a mistake.  Anyway the
<br>
British had artillery, but not heavy enough to penetrate the caves.  A lot
<br>
of troops were lost in a futile attempt to take the mountain, when the
<br>
Japanese emerged from the caves with machine guns and pursued retreating
<br>
attackers through the tall grass.  That happened twice, the third time the
<br>
Gurkhas concealed themselves in the tall grass at midnight.  About seven
<br>
A.M. when the process was repeated, the Japanese ran by the hidden Gurkhas
<br>
and all were chopped to bits by Gurkha kukris.  It was then relatively
<br>
simple to burn out the remaining Japanese caves with napalm and pursue the
<br>
remnants of the Japanese invasion force down the coast toward Rangoon.
<br>
<p>In a non-industrial society, civilians don't operate the machines to produce
<br>
weapons and munitions for front line troops, so civilian casualties I didn't
<br>
weep about in Germany or Japan won't occur in Afghanistan in munitions
<br>
factories, refineries etc.
<br>
There will be civilian casualties---the usual ones where they stumble into a
<br>
fire fight and possibly when used as a human shield, but they will not be
<br>
intentionally targeted---except by the Taliban whose religion has no such
<br>
inhibitions..
<br>
<p>Given the wanton cruelty of the Taliban to their own people it is likely
<br>
they have alienated most of them.  Those who can, flee to Pakistan at the
<br>
risk of death.  For a variety of reasons, most cannot and are starving
<br>
because the 'Taliban takes what little food is available.
<br>
<p>In Afghanistan there is little other than mountains.  The
<br>
mountains do not distinguish between nationalities, they are equally hostile
<br>
to all.  All things considered, I would rather fight in mountains than in
<br>
steaming tropical swamps.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Question: Two years ago I heard a CIA report to Congress that warned of
</em><br>
such
<br>
<em>&gt;terrorist attacks as we saw on 9-11, and yet it seems that not much was
</em><br>
done about it. Why is this and
<br>
<em>&gt; should we expect something to be done now?
</em><br>
<p>Answer: you have to spend real money to get real results.  Only a few
<br>
days back the constant mantra was tax cut, tax cut, tax cut---i.e., the
<br>
taxes necessary to support inspection of passengers, luggage, air and ground
<br>
crews, aircraft---as well as taxes necessary to create a highly mobile,
<br>
quick-response force with new weapons.  Also gone, blown off by Bush a month
<br>
or two back, was the Commission Report on what had to be done to meet
<br>
well-known terrorist threats---tax cut, tax cut, tax cut, shrink government,
<br>
shrink government, shrink a government of almost three hundred million
<br>
people to the size of Burkina Faso government, with the same level of
<br>
services. The cost of those tax cuts were known to anybody above a 70 I.Q.,
<br>
but people below that are unconscious.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Question: No doubt small nuclear devices and/or biological weapons are
</em><br>
already in
<br>
<em>&gt; place in the US and other locations. I wonder why they decided to strike
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; US at this particular time.
</em><br>
<p><p>Answer: the attack on New York and Washington is the culmination of five
<br>
years of planning and preparation.  There is an accumulation of a small
<br>
number of hot-eyed fanatics willing to commit hara-kiri.  You have to use
<br>
them up before they spend too much time here and have second thoughts about
<br>
how nice it would be to live in circumstances previously unknown to them,
<br>
but which we regard as normal.
<br>
<p>As a large-scale trial---you will remember there have been smaller ones, it
<br>
was necessary to test security---preferably with weapons already in place,
<br>
like aircraft full of fuel.  Other attacks using biological weapons require
<br>
their importation or concoction in a makeshift laboratory.  For these you
<br>
don't need kamikaze's---money would be sufficient incentive. Somewhere the
<br>
weaponry has to be tested before it is used.  Tests of this nature have
<br>
recently been made in Iraq and the information was given to Bush by the CIA.
<br>
He ignored it.
<br>
<p>Vaccines for Anthrax, Ebola, Bubonic Plague aren't in sufficient supply to
<br>
be useful.  A belated order for Smallpox vaccine has been made, there is
<br>
practically none in hand.  When the order is filled, it would only be enough
<br>
to protect one out of seven people. .
<br>
<p>In WWII, German suicide squads came ashore in the U.S. to accomplish similar
<br>
sabotage---on the ground, airlines then did not exist.  They were either
<br>
captured or gave themselves up---a prison camp in the U.S offered better
<br>
living conditions than did the front lines to German troops, and the
<br>
prisoners who worked for farmers in Wisconsin hated to leave..
<br>
<p>Of course, the Germans were not religious fanatics and martyrdom is not a
<br>
German tradition or fate to be desired. Actually most Arabs feel the same
<br>
way---if someone wants to commit suicide attacking the U.S., that's
<br>
great---but it's not going to be me.
