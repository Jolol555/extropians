<p>I sent this in.

<p>You already know about Searle's room, now I want to tell you about Clark's
<br>
Chinese Room. You are a professor of Chinese Literature and are in a room
<br>
with me and the great Chinese Philosopher and Poet Laotse. Laotse writes
<br>
something in his native language on a paper and hands it to me. I walk 10 feet
<br>
and give it to you. You read the paper and are impressed with the wisdom of
<br>
the message and the beauty of its language. Now I tell you that I don't know
<br>
a word of Chinese, can you find any deep implications from that fact?
<br>
I believe Clark's Chinese Room is just as profound as Searle's Chinese Room.
<br>
Not very.
<br>
<p>All Searle did was come up with was a wildly impractical model (the Chinese
<br>
Room) of an intelligence in which a human being happens to play a trivial
<br>
part. Consider what's in Searle's model:
<br>
<p>1) An incredible book, larger than the observable universe even if the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;writing was microfilm sized.
<br>
2) An equally large or larger book of blank paper.
<br>
3) A pen, several trillion galaxies of ink, and oh yes I almost forgot,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your little man.
<br>
<p>Searle claims to have proven something profound when he shows that a trivial
<br>
part does not have all the properties that the whole system does. In his
<br>
example the man could be replaced with a simple machine made with a few
<br>
vacuum tubes or even mechanical relays, and it would do a better job.
<br>
It's like saying the synaptic transmitter dopamine does not understand how
<br>
to solve differential equations, dopamine is a small part of the human brain
<br>
thus the human brain does not understand how to solve differential equations.
<br>
<p>Yes, it does seem strange that consciousness is somehow hanging around
<br>
the room as a whole, even if slowed down by a factor of a billion trillion or so,
<br>
but no stranger than the fact that consciousness is hanging around 4 LB's of
<br>
gray goo in our head, and yet we know that it does. It's time to just face the
<br>
fact that consciousness is a property matter has when it is organized in
<br>
certain complex ways.
