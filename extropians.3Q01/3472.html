<p><em>&gt;&gt;As usual Joe your story keeps changing, first it was you that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;received 1200 hostile emails in three days, now it was supposedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the list that received such E-mails. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Everyone on this list knows no such event ever occurred.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;You've been personally invited to join the exi-freedom list but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;you never have, that's because what you would be missing is your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;audience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;By the way, name-calling is against list rules.....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm quite sure that the exi-freedom list is indeed free of dissent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and ieologically monochromatic.  But, on to the attack, for which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I still hold bitter memories... First of all, many on the list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know such an event DID occur; the public record of it is in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;list archives, and during the e-siege I received several private
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emails of support from people who were terrorized to go public
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with such support (which was indeed, I believe, the intention). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Many of the people who were present for it are still subscribed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and their memories have not failed them, whether or not thay have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the courage to connect those memories to their fingers.  Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your gambit, Mr. NRA, is to re-marshall the original gang/pack and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;force a confrontational choice - toss the whole gang, or just toss
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me - hoping that numbers will trump the fairness and justice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who is objectively and provably correct in the matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thusly another droogie who was involved in the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perpetration chimes in; it's like deja vu redux.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;point of personnal privilege&gt;
<br>
<p>Joe, I welcome anyone checking the archives, your story (1200 e-
<br>
mails in three days) is a complete fabrication.
<br>
<p>I went to considerable lengths onetime to post a list demonstrating
<br>
that there is an existing federal gun control law covering everyone
<br>
of your objections.
<br>
<p>You decided to completely ignore this and go off on a rant about
<br>
gun shows instead.
<br>
<p>You continue to rant, and name call when its been pointed out
<br>
numerous times this is against list rules.
<br>
<p>Typical Joe Dees tactics. Your actions speak for themselves.
<br>
<p>I saw something interesting in one of your other posts though, you
<br>
claim to be a former Veteran. Please elaborate, this will be an
<br>
easy thing to check.
