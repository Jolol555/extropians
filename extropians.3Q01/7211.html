<em>&gt; I can't vouch for the authenticity of the followin,

</em><br>
<p>This sounds like an urban legend to me.  I choose not to believe this.  Any
<br>
pilot that says this stuff would be instantly fired.
<br>
<p>A pilot would never scare passengers by reminding them that flying is
<br>
dangerous or telling them that they can't get any help from outside.  There
<br>
are rules against discussing bombs and weapons, even in the hypothetical.
<br>
This just scares the passengers.
<br>
<p>A pilot would never say that there were no new security rules for inside the
<br>
plane after the doors closed.  There are tons of new rules both inside and
<br>
outside the plane.  A passenger making up this story might not know that,
<br>
but a pilot would never be so uninformed.
<br>
<p>A pilot would never talk about a hypothetical bomb threat, would never say
<br>
that it is not possible to fight back against a bomb, and would never say
<br>
that once the doors closed they could not get security help.  Not only does
<br>
this scare the passengers, but it implies that security is not going to be
<br>
able to help them.  Talking about how helpless security procedures are is
<br>
not a good security procedure.
<br>
<p>Finally, a pilot would never give up their authority in advance by telling
<br>
passengers to take matters into their own hands if the flight is threatened.
<br>
Even in a terrorist situation, a pilot wants the crew to handle things.
<br>
They do not want random passengers trying random acts.  The details about
<br>
how to use pillows to block knives, how to hold a blanket over the
<br>
terrorists' head, and specifically the idea that passengers would have to
<br>
hold down the terrorists by themselves while the pilots land the plane is
<br>
even more absurd.
<br>
<p>This is a nice story, but it is clearly written from a passenger's point of
<br>
view.  Pilots don't think like this.  The details are wrong in ways that a
<br>
passenger might mistake, but a pilot wouldn't.  The plans of how to deal
<br>
with the terrorists, with the passengers saving the crew who does nothing,
<br>
is a passenger's fantasy but a pilot's nightmare.  No pilot would tell
<br>
passengers to get ready to risk their lives because the crew won't protect
<br>
them.  This nice story just doesn't make sense from the pilot's point of
<br>
view.
