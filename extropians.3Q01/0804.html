<em>&gt; A rationalist cannot debunk religion with the scientific method any more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a preacher can condemn science with scriptural interpretation.  Neither
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neither side will accept the debunking by the other, while both sides will

</em><br>
<p>Could be, but I think sometimes science wins. For example, Galileo and
<br>
Copernicus proved the church was wrong about how the Earth and Sun relate
<br>
spatially. In any case, individual scientists can debunk religionism among
<br>
themselves to their own satisfaction. Come to think of it, being able to say
<br>
to each other that we scientifically debunked religiosity satisfies me.
<br>
Personally, I don't give a wet fart what the religionists think constitutes an
<br>
adequate debunking. It's the opinion of the scientific community that matters
<br>
to me. I have no respect for the opinions of true believers, because AFAIC,
<br>
their belief is the result of brain dysfunction.

<p>Stay hungry,

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
