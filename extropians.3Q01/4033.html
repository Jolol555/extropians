<p>I had to think about this for a while.
<br>
What I think is happening here is that you see two aspects of people that 
<br>
you don't like (racism and collectivism) and you are trying to relate them 
<br>
together while attempting to ally qualities that you do like (individuality 
<br>
and desire for longevity).
<br>
<p>But it doesn't seem to work. I know of a number of fiercely individualistic 
<br>
racists, and a heck of a lot of collectivists who are vehemently against 
<br>
racism. I also know a lot of collectivists who are suspicious all people 
<br>
not of their own race, and a number of individualists who are racially 
<br>
indiscriminate. Before becoming part of the extropians list I had never 
<br>
before met many people who wished for longevity, but I have known many 
<br>
individualists, racists, collectivists, and non-racists so I doubt it is 
<br>
related to racism, collectivism, or individualism either. My limited time 
<br>
on this list indicates that even among the enlightened people here, who 
<br>
long for immortality, that there is a minority of racists.
<br>
<p>It appears that collectivism, individualism, racism, and probably the 
<br>
desire for immortality, are unrelated.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
