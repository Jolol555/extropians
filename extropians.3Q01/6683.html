<p>If they were able to land it would change everything, especially if they
<br>
could somehow be disguised to blend in with the landscape. They wouldn't
<br>
necessarily have to take off again. How small could you get a video camera,
<br>
power source and transmitter  that could communicate either with a
<br>
high-flying aircraft, balloon, or a satellite? I understand that the climate
<br>
is arid to semi-arid which means lots of sunshine. I wonder how small you
<br>
could get a rechargeable battery and solar panel? If you could make the
<br>
things as small as, say, large pebbles, and if you could figure out some way
<br>
to get them safely down--maybe they could be designed to glide--you could
<br>
distribute the things in likely areas. Maybe use the planes to find areas in
<br>
which to drop the pebble-gliders.
