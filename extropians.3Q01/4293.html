<p><em>&gt;

Perhaps I should mention that I'm writing a masters paper on attitudes to the
<br>
modification of the body - grounded in the sociology of the body - hence why I'm trying
<br>
to understand the various strains of thought regarding the body by those on this list.
<br>
There is a definite obsession with the body in this particular discipline - something
<br>
&lt;
<br>
<p>In what particular discipline?  You don't mean on the extropian list, do you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
that I'm hoping to challenge in this paper - it seem to be based on modern to postmodern
<br>
values of subjectivity versus objectivity, knowledge versus expression...and the like.
<br>
It stems from Satre and even a Romantic notion that the body and self are a whole, and
<br>
that happiness can be found by disciplining and shaping the body to an ideal of
<br>
perfection - here the media comes in and does its stuff!
<br>
&lt;
<br>
<p>Well, it would be totally amazing IMHO if you establish such
<br>
connections.  I always thought that obsession with one's physique
<br>
(that began not coincidentally about the time that Arnold
<br>
Schwartzenegger started to make it really big in the movies)
<br>
really stemmed from the same luxuries that we all enjoy in
<br>
modern day society.  Namely, that we all have the time and
<br>
wherewithall to engage in odd things, whether it is body-
<br>
building, or following email discussion lists, or watching
<br>
Star Wars 200 times.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
Now the problem that I'm getting though is that extropians want to modify and enhance
<br>
themselves through science and technology - their goal is immortality or at least
<br>
longivity.  Now this goal is based on being able to create/design a better body, one that
<br>
does not have the fraility and limitations of the present biological one
<br>
&lt;
<br>
<p>This remark might be better addressed to those who are attempting
<br>
to cheat death by getting very healthy, or like Spike Jones, by
<br>
caloric restriction.  (I'd still bet that they don't quite see it
<br>
as the same thing, but I don't know.)
<br>
<p>I'm a convinced cryonicist, and still think that it's my own best
<br>
chance at living forever.  (I simply doubt that anti-aging drugs
<br>
will be found soon enough for me.)  Yes, in the cryonics literature
<br>
one does often encounter the statement that one will probably re-animate
<br>
with the body of a 20 year old;  but honestly, this seems like small
<br>
change to most cryonicists, who simply wish to continue living
<br>
regardless of what kind of body they get.  So there simply is *not*
<br>
such a &quot;goal to create/design a better body&quot; for cryonicists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - so aren't you just as obsessed with the body as those people who go
</em><br>
down the gym everyday and bust a gut also trying to create the ideal body?
<br>
So you're question below about strange ideas about the body doesn't make
<br>
sense to me.
<br>
&lt;
<br>
<p>Now does the following question make sense after all?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;If I am correct in the above paragraphs, then the next question
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;must arise for me and those who agree with me, is, where are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;people getting all these strange ideas about body image? Has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;something in our culture recently changed?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
Of course it could all come down to self confidence and if one has a strong sense of
<br>
identity - if you're particularly subject to others remarks and opinions of you, then
<br>
of course you will be affected more than someone who has a definite sense of who they
<br>
are...and more importantly who they want to be.
<br>
&lt;
<br>
<p>That hasn't been my experience.  I've noticed some cryonicists and
<br>
extropians get really devoted to becoming maximally physically
<br>
healthy, and they showed absolutely no signs of lacking self-
<br>
confidence.  Sure, people who *are* very insecure---typical teenagers,
<br>
for example---can be overly concerned by their appearance (the pants
<br>
must drag on the ground *just so*), but we can exclude those cases
<br>
when we are talking about extropians.  So no, it's not self-confidence
<br>
either.
