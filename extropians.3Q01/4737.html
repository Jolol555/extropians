Hello,
<br>
I've been a while on the low carb diet, too.
<br>
My experiences weren't that good. In the beginning I lost weight, but
<br>
that was mostly water. Then I reached a plateau were I couldn't loose
<br>
any more weight at all. The low carb diet book recommended drinking
<br>
plenty of water and cutting out even artificially sweetened drinks. I
<br>
found out that low carb diets do not work well when you have
<br>
hypothyroidism (which I have). About the same time my mother-in-law, who
<br>
was also on the low carb diet, told me that her hair began falling out.
<br>
She never had that problem before.
<br>
Now I'm on moderate CR (1500 calories per day), and loose weight slower.
<br>
But according to the physician I'm seeing because of my hypothyroidism,
<br>
I'm on the right track. He said weight loss should be slow.
<br>
Counting calories and grams (i.e. no more than 80 grams of meats per
<br>
day) is tedious, but I feel much better than I felt with the low carb
<br>
diet. A bowl of hot oatmeal (390 calories) for breakfast keeps me
<br>
satisfied much longer than bacon and eggs did :-)
<br>
<p>But, hey, people are different :-) So, if your body is happy with low
<br>
carb, good for you.
<br>

<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 1)  It makes you lean with surprising speed.  I've never seen anything
</em><br>
else
<br>
<em>&gt; like it -- the fat just melted off my body.  This is the only diet
</em><br>
I've ever
<br>
<em>&gt; seen that actually produced results like this and at this speed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  It doesn't interfere with a heavy workout schedule.  I've tried
</em><br>
other
<br>
<em>&gt; low-fat diets to try to become leaner, but they all seemed to have
</em><br>
adverse
<br>
<em>&gt; affects on my workout scheduling, either by making recovery take
</em><br>
longer or
<br>
<em>&gt; just making my muscles feel lethargic (a problem I've had with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vegetarian-ish diets in general).  No problems here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3)  Dairy is bad.  This was the only change I made to the diet
</em><br>
mid-course.
<br>
<em>&gt; Apparently a low-carb diet aggravates the negative effects of diary in
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; diet and generally didn't make me feel that good, so I cut back on
</em><br>
them
<br>
<em>&gt; substantially and stuck with meat and veggies.  I've always known that
</em><br>
dairy
<br>
<em>&gt; wasn't so hot, but this made it that much clearer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4)  No hunger.  This is more than just an issue of an empty stomach.
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; found that the time I could comfortably go between meals was greatly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extended beyond my normal diet as well.  I am guessing this has
</em><br>
something to
<br>
<em>&gt; do with very stable blood sugar levels.  Note that low-fat high-carb
</em><br>
diets
<br>
<em>&gt; always seemed to increase the frequency that I felt hungry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In summary, I feel great, better than I do on my normal diet.  Because
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; this, it is extraordinarily easy to stick with it, and the adjustments
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; been minor, particularly since every third day I eat carbs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given the quality of the results I've had, I will probably make lean
</em><br>
meat
<br>
<em>&gt; and veggies my standard diet until something better comes along; my
</em><br>
body
<br>
<em>&gt; seems quite happy with this diet.  I'm normally skeptical of these
</em><br>
things,
<br>
<em>&gt; but only because most dietary changes appeared to generate adverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences to my body and/or my lifestyle.
</em><br>
