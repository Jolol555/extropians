<p>Guilt does not work.  It backfires in very nasty ways.  Didn't
<br>
several centuries of Judaeo-Christian baggage teach us at least
<br>
that much?  The Catholic Church in the time of Galileo and for
<br>
many centuries before was convinced that the salvation of
<br>
humanity, indiviudal and collective, require accepting its
<br>
doctrines and living by them at all possible cost.  It used
<br>
guilt by the ton to persuade as many as possible to act to save
<br>
all of these poor and ultimately retched beings.  In the process
<br>
it produced centuries of misery.
<br>
<p>Now here we are saying &quot;We have the truth. If we do not spread
<br>
it and act on it then we are massively guilty.  Those who stand
<br>
in our way are massively guilty!&quot;  Bah.  Verily, there is
<br>
nothing new under the sun.
