<p>If the bulkhead was properly designed, the only horrible thing that would 
<br>
happen is that either the cabin or the cockpit would depressurize, while 
<br>
the other retained pressure. If the bulkhead was just slapped in, a'la the 
<br>
&quot;bulletproof shields&quot; put in many taxi cabs, it could cause more damage as 
<br>
it ripped loose of it's mountings. It's just proper engineering to make it 
<br>
safe. Even a makeshift barrier with pressure equalizing valves would not 
<br>
change the pressurization effects, if done correctly.
<br>
<p>If you did not mind losing the payload capacity (and raising fares 
<br>
astronomically) you could indeed put a &quot;vault door&quot; up there. It would be 
<br>
an exceedingly dumb idea unless you are expecting terrorists who attempt to 
<br>
get into the cockpit with high explosives...and then, who would be left to 
<br>
care?
