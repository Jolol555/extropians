<p>Agreed. However, the reason large organizations form is just to
<br>
minimize frictional costs. It's easier to hire somebody to work for
<br>
you permanently than to take bids from contractors every time you need
<br>
a meeting scheduled, report faxed out, or a computer moved. It's
<br>
easier to own a building than to rent space as needed on an hourly
<br>
basis.
<br>
<p>At least, that's how it used to be. With current or soon available
<br>
technologies for automation, communication, and transaction there will
<br>
be little more than inertia stopping people from forming temporary,
<br>
nimble micro-corporations for the purpose of making a profit from one
<br>
specific good or service and dissolving as soon as better
<br>
opportunities arise. An internal free market... or an erasure of the
<br>
boundaries between a corporation's exterior and interior.
<br>
<p>Every chance logistical considerations afford them, people *do* opt
<br>
for the hired-gun business model. Obviously Chrysler and Oracle can't
<br>
just spin themselves off into clouds of micro-corporations, so they
<br>
are attempting to survive in the only way they know-- becoming bigger.
<br>
There are limits to growth, and eventually they will be out-competed
<br>
by smaller, freer, more efficient entities.
<br>
<p>What does this all have to do with abuse of power by
<br>
&quot;rich/professional associations/corps&quot;? The more agents are playing a
<br>
game, the harder collusion becomes. I don't think unfettered
<br>
lassiez-faire would have worked[1] before the internet era, but it may
<br>
work now; it's well worth finding out.
<br>
<p><p>[1] I define 'working' as maximizing aggregate human efforts to
<br>
survive and follow a trajectory that will eventually allow us to
<br>
escape the confines of this planet as well as our own biological
<br>
limitations.
