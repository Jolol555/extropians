&gt; Whoa! You are sounding as fanatical as those who attacked <br>
&gt; you. Capitalism <br>

&gt; If you just blindly wave the flag then you can just about <br>

&gt; Truly *awful* <br>

&gt; Granted that the dickheads who did the despicable acts on the <br>

I can understand a lot of anger over the recent incidents. But aren't any
of you flag wavers<br>
even remotely interested in looking at the full spectrum of issues, that
has caused the US to find <br>
itself so at odds with many factions with Muslim nations.<br><br>
Yes Islam is often repressive, intolerant, and violent. But Islam has not
always been like that.<br><br>
-xx- Damien X-) Wrote <br>
&gt;&gt;And if Islam is so nasty, how come Moslem countries were
historically more <br>
&gt;&gt;tolerant of other religions than Christian Europe? Christians and
Jews were <br>
&gt;&gt;second-class citizens in the Arab Empire, but they were citizens.
In Europe <br>
&gt;&gt;Moors weren't, and Jews were confined to the ghetto, or subjected
to pogroms, <br>
&gt;&gt;at least for a long time.<br><br>
<br><br>
<blockquote type=cite class=cite cite>Miriam, have you not been paying
attention to what they are saying? They<br>
think we are the great evil! They hate western culture because it is
based<br>
on the principles of self-esteem, reason, and Capitalism, and not
sacrifice,<br>
religion, and collectivism. How dare we tip our champagne glasses
when<br>
people are starving. How dare we indulge in air-conditioning when there
are<br>
so many without it. How dare we be a rich, pleasurable, rational
society<br>
when there are so many that aren't! </blockquote><br>
Your the one missing the point, these are not the reasons that the
terrorist constantly circle<br>
around American interests. You only have to examine the statements they
make themselves <br>
to realize that. Bin Ladden is a multi millionaire how can you reasonably
suggest that a man <br>
with such wealth at his finger tips ( much as i understand it earned on
the freemarket ) is jealous <br>
of US wealth.<br><br>
Bin Ladden and his follows primary grievance with the US seem to be based
around<br>
American support of Israel. And the what he and his supporters see as an
unjust level<br>
of violence direct at the Palestinians. <br><br>
Blindly supporting Israel no matter what, look over this list and tell me
that at least a <br>
few are not justified. <br>
Fact:-<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><u><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ia/palestinefoever/UNresolutions.html" eudora="autourl">http://www.angelfire.com/ia/palestinefoever/UNresolutions.html</a></u></font>
<br>
Even if you take the view that the UN ( over the period covered ) <br>
was controlled entirely by Arabs and Soviets which is absurd. I find it hard to ignore <br>
so many resolutions. <br>
Despite all this violations the US has rarely made any kind of criticisms of Israel's policy. <br>
Seven of the resolutions concern Geneva convention violations ! <br>
Just to make the point i am NOT any kind of Anti-Semite. <br>
IMHO America supports Israel for some of the reasons it supported Iraq against Iran. Because <br>
it is politically expedient to do so, nothing to do with fairness or balance.<br><br>
Of course non of this justifies crashing jets into buildings, but you must be willing to try and understand <br>
the true motives of these ppl. Rather than just painting them as jealous representatives of<br>
an inferior culture.<br><br>
<blockquote type=cite class=cite cite>This is a war of ideas. We are fighting<br>
an philosophy here. Bin laten is one little manifestation of that system.<br>
Kill him and 500 more will be cranked out. Its the system that needs to be<br>
removed and ASAP. You didn't see those dancing in the streets? They are just<br>
as guilty as Bin Laden because they support the governments that support the<br>
terrorist. I cant imagine that this list would be in such disagreement on<br>
theses issues. Those countries are the most luddite, anti-technology,<br>
anti-capitalist, anti-reason countries you could find. You go right ahead<br>
and think about particular concretes and don't try to link these concretes<br>
and understand the relationship. What is the commonality in all these<br>
countries other then their intense hatred of America for its greatness? Why<br>
do they hate us? Well maybe if we don't look for a reason and address it,<br>
the problem will go away.<br><br>
It also amazes me that on a list where towers/elevators to space would be<br>
discussed, there would be the suggestion not building them because they<br>
might be torn down or might be dangerous.<br><br>
Try to break free of the concretes of the issue and deal with the overlaying<br>
abstractions. Bin Laden needs to be dealt with, but what created him? What<br>
mindset and philosophical viewpoint is he coming from. </blockquote><br>
Here is another fact you seem to want to completely ignore, concerning Bin Laddens<br>
creation.<br><br>
Fact:-<br>
Bin Ladden was trained by the CIA in the first place. Huge home goal <br>
not the first remember Ho Chi Minh, and Noreiga, and there are others. <br>
This also happens with Nations US policy supports Countries who can be used to <br>
achieve convenient foreign policy goals. Like covertly supporting Iraq in it's war against <br>
Iran. Think i've made my point on this one.<br><br>
<br>
This one is a matter of opinion, one which i think has been tragically born out by recent events. <br>
Primarily that successive US administrations have taken what i call the &quot;World Sheriff&quot; foreign <br>
policy perspective. Being willing to essential bully and threaten other nations into compliance <br>
with US desires. Now some of the policies pursued have be to every ones benefit and completely <br>
reasonable. <br>
However it does not take a genius to work out how a tactic of coercion generated long standing <br>
bad feeling and hatred within some of those nations. <br>
I am NOT anti-American some US foreign policy however is badly flawed.<br>
I think this gives us a few points to discuss, and please lets keep this a discussion, the only reason i raise <br>
these issues is because imho i see one of the most interesting and dynamic cultures on the planet making <br>
some huge mistakes. And i am baffle by the apparent lack of perspective on them.<br><br>
As am getting tired of saying. Of course non of this excuses the kind of actions perpetrated on Tuesday.<br>
But to ignore the full range of elements contributing to the situation is not only dishonest, but almost guarantees<br>
some form of repeat performance.<br><br>
Maybe some of you guys should watch some no domestic news channels. I recommend BBC News 24<br>
they have had several reports from relevant experts and reporters from around the world. Who have highlighted <br>
exactly the issue that i keep raising.<br><br>
I'd really like to here some of your comments on the points i've raised here. As i've noticed over the past few <br>
days that most of the sabre rattling flag wavers, have developed and amazing capacity for complete ignoring post contain<br>
direct information that challenges their opinions <br><br>

<blockquote type=cite class=cite cite>Ill tell you its one<br>
that very popular here in our country and that you will find his ideas<br>
reflected in numerous circles here ranging from the environmental/anti-man<br>
movement, to the religions here. They all agree that the individual needs to<br>
be placed on the alter of self-sacrifice to the masses. Both the extreme<br>
left in this country and the extreme right believe exactly as Bin Laden,<br>
that the individual is nothing compared to the<br>
environment/religion/masses/cultural group. History is the battle of ideas,<br>
and if you don't support your own system with the full belief that you are<br>
correct, they you are going consigned to the quagmire of guilt that so many<br>
around now seemed to be steeped in. The big enemies we should be fighting on<br>
our front (as well as those foreign) are guilt and fear. Most of the guilt<br>
is because we still have in this age of moon walks and supercomputers, that<br>
we still possess the philosophy of cave men. Those that carry that<br>
philosophy, and its a majority of people for the most part, deserve it and<br>
the guilt.<br>
