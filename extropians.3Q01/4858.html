<p>I don't recall projecting the first time, so I'm definitely not projecting
<br>
&quot;again&quot; (and what did I write that could be considered a projection?).

<p><em> &gt; I recall in high school physics, where of the 35 people in the room, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only two people that ever seemed to get the subject matter completely
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Admirable.  But I was not saying lay people need to understand physics or
<br>
chemistry or any other branch of science the way people involved in those
<br>
subjects intimately would need to understand them.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I don't think its impossible to teach nail pounders about science, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the vast majority of them *have absolutely no interest* in it. By the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; without an education, they really don't see a point in it.
</em><br>
<p>I've learned that people who work for their leisure often have interesting
<br>
hidden talents and pastimes.  They are not what they &quot;do&quot; - in fact, hardly
<br>
anyone is.
