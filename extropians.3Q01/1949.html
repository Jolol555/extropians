</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There is no need to assume secret cabals of ex-stasi or KGB agents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; behind the scenes. It is more a matter of a lot of well-meaning people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who have a faulty model of how world economy works being partially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; influenced by some self-serving groups with compelling arguments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This definitely agrees with my personal experiences with such.  Now, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this diagnosis is correct, what is the best cure?  Education (but how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get it into unwilling heads)?  Publically discrediting this belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system (but how to do so powerfully enough to pry it loose)?  Or is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there a more effective way?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think there is a single way. But some remedies might be:
<br>
<p>* Discredit the self-interested groups. Since their positions are actually
<br>
based to a large extent on their own gain rather than (say) a concern for
<br>
others, demonstrating this and the hollowness of their arguments can do a
<br>
lot of good. But this becomes much easier if the counter-arguments are
<br>
understandable.
<br>
<p>* For arguments to work, they must be understandable. Expressing the
<br>
benefits of free trade, free movement of people, open societies and so on
<br>
in a way that *anyone* can understand is a huge challenge that should be
<br>
met. Well crafted arguments may of course cut through a lot of rigid belief
<br>
systems, but they are hard to create. It is better to aim at &quot;the middle
<br>
ground&quot;, the large population of people not strongly polarized but not very
<br>
knowledgeable and get them to learn about these ideas. That can help create
<br>
a culture that can absorb more advanced arguments.
<br>
<p>* Aim at the intellectuals. As Hayek pointed out (I know Waldemar and I are
<br>
starting to sound like a broken record about this) in _The Intellectuals
<br>
and Socialism_, if you can get the memes into the intellectual strata of
<br>
society, they they will spread much more efficiently and affect other parts
<br>
of society. This requires a lot of dedicated work, but eventually it will
<br>
be worth it (as socialism demonstrated). 
<br>
<p>* Network, the others are doing it. Transhumanists are currently rather
<br>
weakly networked, mainly with other geek networks. Not bad, but we can do
<br>
far better. Our ideas, expressed in the right way, can interest some quite
<br>
powerful groups that are on our side. We can provide some unique or at
<br>
least unusual perspectives on problems. As Greg put it, we can help fortify
<br>
the institutions of the enlightenment.
