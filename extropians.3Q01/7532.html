<p><em>&gt;One question I had was how long the immunity lasts. If you were vaccinated
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;infant and then re-vaccinated as a young adult and the second did not take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(no second scar) does that mean you had adequate protection from smallpox
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the time of the second vaccination? And does that provide any indication
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of protection as an adult?
</em><br>
<p>Immunity will decay, but it won't go away barring some serious problem
<br>
with your immune system.  The nature of smallpox - a slow infection which
<br>
kills by destroying so much skin you die of septic complications - means even
<br>
light immunity is highly beneficial.  There's time to ramp up immunity and
<br>
reducing the severity of infection greatly reduces mortality.  The old form
<br>
of &quot;vaccination&quot; against pox was to insert an infected pox under the skin.
<br>
Although the recipient got pox, it was very mild as it's a slower spread
<br>
than via the inhaled route.  Even that slowing reduced mortality to a
<br>
tiny fraction and even largely nixed scarring.  So if you've had immunization,
<br>
don't worry about yourself.
