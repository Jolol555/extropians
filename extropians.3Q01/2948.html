<em>&gt; That is an interesting take on MS's dangerously insecure operating systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had simply thought it was more of this, printed in The Age (a reputable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australian Newspaper) early last year:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US secret agents work at Microsoft: French intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Source: AFP | Published: Saturday February 19, 7:44 AM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PARIS, Feb 18 - A French intelligence report today accused US secret agents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of working with computer giant Microsoft to develop software allowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Washington to spy on communications around the world.
</em><br>
<p><p>The French have reason to be paranoid.  Several years ago, there were a
<br>
couple moderately well-known cases where French government backdoor
<br>
shenanigans in international negotiations were manipulated and/or exposed by
<br>
the US government.  It was eventually figured out by the French government
<br>
that many of the American commercial hardware and software products they
<br>
were using had been monkeyed by the US intelligence services to monitor
<br>
foreign governmental activities.
<br>
<p>Of course, the French had it coming.  For many years now, the French have
<br>
held the title of being the number one perpetrator of espionage against the
<br>
US, usually in close competition with China for the title.  What many people
<br>
don't know, is that the US was deporting *hundreds* of French spies
<br>
annually, or at least in the early 90's when I had a working knowledge of
<br>
this.
