</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shop classes were very popular in schools I have attended (in Illinois,

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>They were popular in the high school when I was in elementary school,
<br>
but were phazed out by the school district despite high popularity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; Our society has so successfully stigmatized the trades that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very difficult to find people to fill these jobs, and contrary to

<em>&gt; &gt; social myth, not just anyone will do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is considered very uncool to end up in the trades these days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think it was uncool.  I think computer nerds and science nerds were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncool, but the shop guys or the jocks never were.  I think the real reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people disdain shop is because it is training for a low-wage job.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the free market at work, showing which jobs are more valued (in dollars)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than others.  By the way, the jocks with a chance at sports scholarships or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting drafted were the most popular heroes on campus.  They expected to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rich.  Those who could make it into sports or science went to shop.
</em><br>
<p>Apparently, Harvey, you've never actually calculated the money that
<br>
plumbers, auto mechanics, and machinists actually make.
<br>
<p>While not at the level of doctors and lawyers, or computer security
<br>
consultants, it is close.
<br>
<p>Jocks were the popular heroes for hormonal reasons, regardless of any
<br>
chances at playing pro sports, and generally only those jocks of the
<br>
popular sports. I was captain of the ski team, and it could be said I
<br>
was the only member of my high school class to be a professional
<br>
athlete, as I was a professional ski instructor on a full and part time
<br>
basis, off and on, for years, and raced competitively into college
<br>
(until I broke my back), with sponsorships from ski equipment
<br>
manufacturers. Despite all this, in high school, I was not nearly a
<br>
BMOC, since my primary identity was the smartest guy in class with a 160
<br>
IQ. Girls could be smart, guys could not.
