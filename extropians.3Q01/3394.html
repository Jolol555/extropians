<em>&gt; Hey, I've read Warren Farrell, myself.  Certain biases against men, women,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ugly people, short people, fat people, poor people (and on and on and on)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist, and those are all different subjects in their own right (but cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BEGIN to touch the subject of &quot;white on black&quot; racism that has existed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our country).  As to the &quot;any white male can tell you&quot; - all right, let's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start with the white alpha male currently residing in the White (no pun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intended) House - can he tell me the terrible trials and tribulations he's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone through on his road to recove...eh, I mean, on his road to the White
</em><br>
<em>&gt; House?  I wonder.  Wouldn't he qualify as an &quot;any&quot; male?  Any white male,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you say, huh?  (Get serious!)
</em><br>
<p><p>Anecdotal.
<br>
<p>There actually are places in the U.S. where white people are overtly
<br>
discriminated against for the purest definitions of racism, though not many.
<br>
Specifically, if a white American has ever lived on an &quot;Indian&quot; reservation
<br>
and/or in an area that is predominantly native American, you will quickly
<br>
learn what it means to be the &quot;nigger&quot; of society.  I'm talking about
<br>
blatant discrimnation and persecution by the local police and judicial
<br>
system, preferential consideration being given to people that aren't white,
<br>
as well as receiving generally poor treatment by the population at large.
<br>
<p>Now, the vast majority of white people haven't lived in one of those areas,
<br>
but I have and it sucked.  My naturally excessive ego allowed me to ignore
<br>
and cope with what was an otherwise depressing environment.  In my
<br>
experience it was comparable to the worst of the backwater Mississippi towns
<br>
(going the other direction), having some experience with those locales as
<br>
well.  Of course, all those places have one thing in common: they are
<br>
largely populated with small-minded twits.
