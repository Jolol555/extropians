<em>&gt; I realise you're not actually arguing for any of these things.
</em><br>
<p>Being born does confer on you the right to claim against those who
<br>
brought you into this world for any resources necessary to become an
<br>
independent, fully enfranchised human being. This is the responsibility
<br>
that is entailed in a parent exercising their right to procreate. Once
<br>
you are fully enfranchised, if you still resent being born, it is your
<br>
right to end your life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Not too long ago one Timothy McVeigh had his right to life, well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; severely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;abridged.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quite so. His execution was justified by law (which does not necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean that I approve of such laws, just that it was, in fact, the law).
</em><br>
<p>McVeigh abridged his own life by his actions. Since the right to live
<br>
contains a corrollary right to choose to not live (just as the right to
<br>
free speech contains a corrollary right to choose to not speak), every
<br>
criminal who commits an act which results in their own exection is
<br>
simply exercising their own right to choose to not live.
