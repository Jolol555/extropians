<p><em>&gt; &gt;Your exaggerated example presents a weak argument because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; contact lenses are certain not known as an advanced technology by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;today’s standards.  What a contact lens does suggest quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;clearly is that such a technology is an historical, however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;small, step toward more fully augmenting the visual sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;capability.  Let it be known, however, wearing a contact lens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;does not exempt a person from being a transhuman.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;More productively, a contact lens is an excellent example in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;expressing how humans have been augmenting their bodies for quite
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Hmm. How is a contact lense any different from a screwdriver? Both are tools
</em><br>
that augment the human body to make certain things easier. Are you
<br>
suggesting that all tool-users are transhuman? So any attempt to improve our
<br>
abilities through constructs of matter makes us transhuman for the duration
<br>
of that attempt?&lt;
<br>
<p>Reason, be reasonable -:)  If you are a transhuman by some other more advanced technology, a chip in your brain that gives you more processing power, then the out-dated contact lens would not keep you from being a transhuman just because it is antiquated.  I hope this is clear.  
<br>
<p>Now, with that said, tool-users are folks who use tools. As for the great leap in your thinking -- &quot;... makes us transhuman for the duration of that attempt?...&quot;  Well this depends.  If you have one robotic leg, a brain enhancer for processing power, and a robotic eye that can see through walls one year and then three days later you have an entirely new body that is engineered with nanotechnology and AI, yes you would be a transhuman is transition.  BUT, if you use a hammer one day and a screwdriver to tighten the valves on your car the next day, and *then* have a spanking new upgraded nano-driven body on the third day, I'd have to say that you have been a transhuman for only that day my friend.  But, this is only my view.
