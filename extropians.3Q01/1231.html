</em><br>
<p>Think gamma ray burst.  What if that is the weapon or something disruptive
<br>
like that?  The only purpose might be to destroy, disrupt, or confuse -- not
<br>
to invade and occupy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Well, it depends on the goals.  If the goal is just disruption, then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't have to successfully grab the cluster from the JBrains, just make
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; less useable for them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, but the expense on your side is symmetrical. This is not space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opera. This is teeth against claw, metric gigaton against metric gigaton.
</em><br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Only for a while, I would think.  If you used stealth initially --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perhaps while setting up shop -- then went off stealth once you'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assured yourself that there were no likely competitors or spoiled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sports, then the only loss would be the initial period of stealthing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and any residuals from that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, but is everybody out there *still* hiding? After all the Gyears of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starting time?
</em><br>
<p>Well, of course, the Hubble data was, IIRC, on one cluster.  It hasn't
<br>
peeked into every nook and cranny.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I presume a cloud of nodes would be less like a ecology or a society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and more like an exclusive club or a firm -- at least, initially.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right, initially. But the initial clique gets amlified orders over orders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of magnitude, and every fluctuation will get magnified to planetary scale.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They *will* be heterogenous, soon.
</em><br>
<p>That seems plausible unless some other type of organization (and
<br>
communication technology?) is (are) found.  Then the club might turn more
<br>
into a hive then into one supermind, no?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So, there might be some agreement over resource usage and, if need be,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; defense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course there's some agreement amongst some agents, but the rest of it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is just savannah and coral reef. It doesn't participate (why, it is pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mindless), but you can't control it, either. It has a signature the size
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Manhattan. You can't hide that.
</em><br>
<p>Think of hiding Manhattan in the solar system.  If I put it on the other
<br>
side of Neptune and always keep it pointing away from Earth, humans still
<br>
wouldn't know it exists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This assumes a certain degree of rationality on the part of both parties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The ones which will be fighting, will be smart enough.
</em><br>
<p>Smart does not equal rational.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This doesn't mean 10^N - 1 times out of 10^N the JBrains won't win.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that 1 though that might bother them enough to use some countermeasures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Also, it might not be us they're stealthed against.  Think of the
</em><br>
scenario
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in Pohl Anderson's _Gateway_ series, where there's one really advanced
</em><br>
race
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that is doing _ultramegascale_ engineering -- IIRC, changing the global
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; geometry of the universe -- and doesn't want any interference, doesn't
</em><br>
even
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; want potential sources of interference evolving.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right now we have to idea whether ultramegascale is even feasible. We know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we can do with self-rep machinery, especially nano, that's about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for the rest of it, we'll know when we get there.
</em><br>
<p>I was just bringing a scenario for consideration.  I would say, right now,
<br>
it is feasible.  If you move enough matter around -- this is basically most
<br>
of what you have to do here right -- you can re-engineer the known universe.
<br>
(If the universe is infinite or if it's already expanding hyperbolically,
<br>
then I concede the point.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Meanwhile, we've got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billions of local scale problems, which are yet unsolved, so I tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; save my worries for when/if we get there.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  I don't lie awake at night pondering what JBrains are up to.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
