<em>&gt;I was interested in getting a vaccination for my daughter, who was born
</em><br>
<em>&gt;after small pox was eradicated world-wide and was told that there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;serum available for the general public. None at all, not for any price, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anywhere in the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I asked if cow pox still exists &quot;in the wild&quot; and didn't get a clear answer.
</em><br>
<p>Barbara, I expect the reason you could not get a clear answer is they don't
<br>
know. 
<br>
There was some discussion in the scientific community if the remaining lab
<br>
samples should be destroyed.
<br>
Science had some discussion I remember. I don't think they were destroyed.
<br>
<p>But today we don't know if any of these lab samples have been diverted.
<br>
<p>And there was some concern I remember that the virus might exist in bodies
<br>
and might enter the population if 
<br>
corpses infected with smallpox were exhumed.
<br>
<p>So given the possibility of infection I would opt to let the individual
<br>
decide if they wanted to be vaccinated.
<br>
But we are not given that choice. And since the vaccine is based on cow pox
<br>
and not smallpox it would appear rather safe to continue to allow doctors
<br>
access to the vaccine.
<br>
