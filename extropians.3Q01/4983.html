<em>&gt; &gt;Another thing, most of the mexican immigrants are indians, and they are
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;uneducated peasants who get the grunt work that would be going to US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;citizens otherwise.  I am part indian, so therefore by the current
</em><br>
calculus
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of racial political correctness, I get to criticise them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indians or mestizos? I would have thought mestizos were a bigger
</em><br>
component.
<br>
<em>&gt; Also, I wonder about the competition for jobs, can you elaborate? Wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US citizens be glad to leave the grunt work to the immigrants, and aim for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other jobs of a more pleasant nature? As for the political correctness
</em><br>
issue,
<br>
<em>&gt; it is a US feature that I'm still unable to understand at all, so you
</em><br>
don't
<br>
<em>&gt; need to worry about me thinking you can't criticise them on that account.
</em><br>
<p>I'm with you, Carlos.  Even though I've been accused of being a nefarious
<br>
exponent of &quot;PC&quot; on this list, to tell you the truth I don't understand PC
<br>
myself.  Having been an uncloseted atheist since I was a teenager, I've not
<br>
exactly been &quot;PC&quot; on this and a score of other issues.
<br>
<p>Charlton Heston (in that sucky Harvard speech that was posted to this list
<br>
earlier) talks about PC, but wants to impose another (his own) brand of PC?
<br>
PC is a pretty meaningless term, the way I see it.
<br>
<p>Maybe PC is simply a knee-jerk response used to dismiss people with certain
<br>
differing political views.  But what does it really mean?  Without
<br>
specifics, I don't think it's very useful.
