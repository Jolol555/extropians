<p>Agreed. 
<br>
<p>At the same time this is in many ways just a test :-( The problem of
<br>
destruction - that the amount of destruction attainable by an
<br>
individual is increasing along with technology, and countermeasures
<br>
seldom work against irrational agents - is serious and growing. 
<br>
<p>The big problem is that we don't have any good solutions to it: the
<br>
standard response at present is to demand that Big Brother save us
<br>
through Echelon, Carnivore and DMCA - which will not really work,
<br>
but will erode civil liberties, add significant risks of abuse and
<br>
quite likely make people feel even more alienated against the
<br>
government, increasing risks of new attacks. Suggesting a Sysop is
<br>
really the same thing, but with the stipulation that this BB really
<br>
does work and never gets corrupted - which is easy, since the Sysop
<br>
resides in the comfortable realm of future technology. The
<br>
transparent society might at least keep some civil liberties and
<br>
remain an open society, but the cultural changes needed will be
<br>
rather wrenching. Relinquishment simply doesn't work, and besides we
<br>
have enough bombs and airplanes already. We can't scatter into space
<br>
yet, and besides we all need the greater human society to function
<br>
and prosper. 
<br>
<p>Of these partial solutions, some appear more promising than others.
<br>
The transparent society ideas of accountability and the ability to
<br>
trace stuff would help discourage the more rational irrationalists,
<br>
and might even allow the discovery of dangerous plots before they
<br>
are executed. If these traits could be combined with a
<br>
self-enforcing structure (legal, economic, software, whatever) that
<br>
prevents abuse, much would be won. We need more than just the need
<br>
for court orders to bring out keys from escrow, something that can't
<br>
be easily subverted by a new regime. Distributed encrypted legal
<br>
smart contracts, perhaps?
<br>
<p>The risk with disasters like today is that people feel powerless and
<br>
stressed, and hence opt for the easiest solutions rather than think
<br>
of new ones.  We have a huge problem, we need to solve it, and we
<br>
need a *good* solution. Otherwise this will happen again and again,
<br>
on larger and larger scales.
