<p>Excuse my pursuing this idea, I blame the engineer in me. :-)
<br>
<p>If the flying devices were as small as seagulls or hawks and were able to 
<br>
land and take off again (this is actually easier on mountainsides than on 
<br>
flat ground) then they would be able to look across at people from 
<br>
neighboring hillsides and see their faces. In fact once on the ground they 
<br>
use very little power at all. If they could be camoflaged as rocks, the way 
<br>
some birds already do so damn well, then they would be incredibly 
<br>
unobtrusive -- almost invisible even from a few meters away. (I have been 
<br>
startled by a previously unseen bird flying up from open ground only a few 
<br>
feet away from me, and I have excellent eyesight.) They could settle in on 
<br>
hillsides opposite known trails and just watch, beaming info up to 
<br>
satellites only when they have something to send. If a human came too near 
<br>
for comfort they could launch themselves again, just looking like an 
<br>
alarmed bird, and go somewhere else.
<br>
<p>Of course your point about face coverings remains a major problem... 
<br>
perhaps an insuperable one. Is anybody aware of distinguishing clothing 
<br>
patterns?
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
