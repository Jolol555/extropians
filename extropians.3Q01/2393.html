<em>&gt; &gt; So I guess I'm not really reaching for forever.  But a couple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thousand eons or so would sure be nice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;At a hundred-million-to-one subjective speedup, a billion years will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;occupy approximately five minutes.  I don't know if we'll all want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;flash into that kind of accelerated time the instant the Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wavefront hits - I guess it depends on whether the physical time is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;valuable - but I do expect that we'll be running at that kind of speed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eventually...
</em><br>
<p>Not sure I follow.  Are you saying that because we'll be able to 
<br>
think/compute much faster, that time will (or seem to) speed up?  Wouldn't 
<br>
it be just the opposite?  If the uploaded &quot;you&quot; could think a thousand 
<br>
thoughts per second, compared to the meat-based &quot;you&quot; which is limited to, 
<br>
say, a thousand thoughts per minute, wouldn't it seem that you had lived a 
<br>
full minute in the space of a single second?  If so, a real minute would 
<br>
seem, to you, to drag on for a whole hour.  And as your ability to compute 
<br>
sped up, wouldn't time for you continue to seem to slow down?
<br>
<p>In fact isn't that part of the Omega Point theory?  That at some point our 
<br>
computational speed will approach the infinite, making it possible to 
<br>
experience nearly infinite thoughts/computations within the finite time 
<br>
before the heat death or Big Crunch?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, any human mind would disintegrate long, long before you'd even begun
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to get started on a billion years.
</em><br>
<p>Why?  Because meat-based things decompose with age?  Or do you suspect that 
<br>
there is something inherent in the design/function of the human brain that 
<br>
makes it incapable of greatly extended functionality?  Would you feel 
<br>
differently if strong nano made possible the continuous monitor and repair 
<br>
of neurological structure at the molecular level?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A couple of millennia and I suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you will, of necessity, have changed to the point where you can see time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stretching into infinity.
</em><br>
<p>Unless I'm missing something, to me this seems contradictory to your earlier 
<br>
statement that time will seem to contract.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>Life is good.  Refuse to die.
