<br>
<p><p>For immediate release: September, 2001
<br>
<p>* Libertarian Futurist Society announced Prometheus Award winners
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sept. 2 at the Philadelphia Worldcon
<br>
* L. Neil Smith won Best Novel for &quot;Forge of the Elders&quot;
<br>
<p>At its annual Worldcon award ceremony Sept. 2 in Philadelphia, the
<br>
Libertarian Futurist Society  presented its annual Prometheus Award
<br>
for Best Novel to L. Neil Smith's &quot;Forge of the Elders&quot; (Baen Books).
<br>
<p>The Prometheus Awards ceremony preceded a panel discussion on &quot;Beyond Ayn
<br>
Rand and Robert Heinlein: Libertarian SF.&quot; The panel was held from 4 to 5
<br>
p.m. Sunday Sept.  2 at the Pennsylvania Convention Center and
<br>
Philadelphia Marriott in Philadelphia.
<br>
<p>L. Neil Smith has won the Prometheus Award twice before: in 1984 for The
<br>
Probability Broach, and in 1994 for Pallas.
<br>
<p>Forge of the Elders combines two previously published novels with the
<br>
story's finale, finally published a decade later.  The story concerns the
<br>
culture clash between the human members of an expedition to asteroid 5023
<br>
Eris, and the multitude of aliens they find when they arrive.  The twist
<br>
is that the aliens are anarchist individualists with a sophisticated
<br>
culture, while the humans were sent by a monolithic socialist/communist
<br>
world government.  The culture clash results in a few mysterious deaths,
<br>
and the investigation of the possible murders reveals much about the
<br>
motivations of the perpetrators and suspects.
<br>
<p><p>The other finalists in the voting for the 2001 Prometheus Award were:
<br>
<p>* Lodestar, by Michael Flynn  (TOR Books)
<br>
* The Sky Road, by Ken MacLeod  (TOR Books)
<br>
* The Truth, by Terry Pratchett  (HarperCollins)
<br>
* Eagle Against the Stars, by Steve White (Baen Books)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve novels were nominated by LFS members for this year's awards.
<br>
The other nominees were Candle, by John Barnes (TOR Books); The Legend
<br>
That Was Earth, by James Hogan (Baen Books); Outlaw School, by Rebecca
<br>
Ore (HarperCollins/EOS); Chimera, by Will Shetterly (TOR Books);
<br>
Vampire Nation, by Thomas Sipos (www.communistvampires.com);
<br>
Conspiracies, by F. Paul Wilson (Forge Books); and All the Rage, by
<br>
F. Paul Wilson (FORGE Books)
<br>
<p><p>The 2001 winner of the Hall of Fame award for Best Classic Fiction was
<br>
&quot;The Survival of Freedom&quot;, an sf anthology edited by Jerry Pournelle and
<br>
John Carr.  Pournelle shared the prometheus award in 1992 with Larry Niven
<br>
for Fallen Angels.  The LFS' first Special Prometheus Award for Lifetime
<br>
Achievement went to Poul Anderson.  Both of these awards were presented at
<br>
LFScon, the Libertarian Futurist Society's first national conference and
<br>
20th anniversary celebration, held May 25-27 in conjunction with Marcon 36
<br>
in Columbus, Ohio.  The audience of more than 1,000 people were treated to
<br>
the Awards ceremony as part of the Masquerade festivities.
<br>
<p>Karen Anderson, Poul's wife and a guest of honor, accepted for Anderson,
<br>
whose illness had prevented him from attending LFScon as Marcon's Grand
<br>
Master guest of honor.  Anderson, widely respected as a Grand Master of
<br>
S.F., already had been recognized by the LFS three times over the past two
<br>
decades, having won the Prometheus Hall of Fame twice for &quot;The Star Fox&quot;
<br>
and &quot;Trader to the Stars&quot; and the Best Novel award for &quot;The Stars Are Also
<br>
Fire&quot; (1995).  Poul Anderson passed away July 31, 2001 at the age of 74.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prometheus awards for Best Novel, Best Classic Fiction (Hall of
<br>
Fame) and (occasional) Special awards honor outstanding science
<br>
fiction/fantasy that explores the possibilities of a free future,
<br>
champions human rights (including personal and economic liberty),
<br>
dramatizes the perennial conflict between individuals and coercive
<br>
governments, or critiques the tragic consequences of abuse of power--
<br>
especially by the State.
<br>
<p>The Prometheus Award, sponsored by the Libertarian Futurist Society (LFS),
<br>
was established in 1979, making it one of the most enduring awards after
<br>
the Nebula and Hugo awards, and one of the oldest fan-based awards
<br>
currently in sf.  Presented annually since 1982 at the World Science
<br>
Fiction Convention, the Prometheus Awards include a gold coin and plaque
<br>
for the winners.
<br>
<p>The Hall of Fame, established in 1983, focuses on older classic fiction,
<br>
including novels, novellas, short stories, poems and plays.  Past Hall of
<br>
Fame award winners range from Robert Heinlein and Ayn Rand to Ray Bradbury
<br>
and Ursula LeGuin.
