From: &quot;Zero Powers&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:zero_powers@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Paying%20for%20Schools%20(was:%20SOCIETY:%20Re:%20The%20privatization%20of%20public%20security)&In-Reply-To=&lt;09a401c12eca$df7765a0$e15c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">zero_powers@hotmail.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; To the extent that the question was rhetorical, I suppose you could say it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was &quot;insincere&quot; or &quot;disengenuous,&quot; but it was not mean-spirited.  It was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just an attempt to show why I take issue with your suggestion that poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents should have their kids taken away.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't write &quot;poor parents,&quot; I wrote &quot;deadbeat parents,&quot; IOW, unfit parents,
<br>
which means that they brought children into the world without having the
<br>
ability to properly care for them, which indicates negligence and
<br>
irresponsibility. Note that.
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
