<em>&gt; Samantha, I do think you're being too tolerant here.  Can you give me an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example of a correct conclusion or useful strategy that can be arrived at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by being religious and cannot be arrived at in any other way?  Actually,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let me ease that requirement; can you show me a strategy or knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is easily *invented* by religion but is harder to arrive at through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Is life only about &quot;correct conclusions&quot;?  If a different way of
<br>
looking at my life,  what I am doing, what we are all doing and
<br>
what can come of it integrates into something that strengthens
<br>
my ability to contribute maximally and may help others to do so
<br>
then that is in itself quite important.
<br>
<p>Can a vision of the type of future you wish to create come only
<br>
from rationality or do you need to add quite a few different
<br>
elements and include a large dose of what you would most like to
<br>
see, do what you can to weave it into a unity and then look for
<br>
tools and memes to encourage it to come into being?  Is this all
<br>
a rational process or are only rational tools such as science
<br>
and logic allowed in forming the vision and in encouraging it
<br>
into reality? 
<br>
<p><p>Religions are great tools for weaving visions.  For good and
<br>
ill.  They are also quite good for cohering societies devoted at
<br>
different levels to common goals.  And I believe some of these
<br>
systems have quite a lot to say about letting go of your current
<br>
mental/emotional lockstep and redefining and reintegrating
<br>
yourself.  This is a very important skill for what most of us
<br>
contemplate doing and becoming.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even so, I wouldn't want to be religious because, to my mind, it's better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be rational and strive to improve that rationality than to do something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that has short-term benefits but is crippling in the long term.  But what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm asking for here is an example of even a short-term cognitive benefit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and by that I mean &quot;coming up with a right answer&quot;, and not alleged lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stress levels and so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Isn't this a bit circular?  You say it is better to be rational
<br>
and improve that rationality but exactly what is that to you and
<br>
what do you use to validate that conclusion as best?  What makes
<br>
you believe that all spirituality/religion is crippling in the
<br>
long term?  In point of fact it seems not to be so for many
<br>
spiritual/religious-ly inclined people. 
<br>
<p>Is the 'right answer&quot; the only thing important?  I growing into
<br>
a saner, more caring, more generous person of less worth than
<br>
getting some cognitive &quot;right answer&quot;?  Is living life with an
<br>
inner calmness even in the midst of the most strenuous and
<br>
hectic activity so worthless that that without any extra &quot;right
<br>
answer&quot; is of no worth?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I do want to strengthen my challenge a little bit beyond asking for an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance of when a normally confused person will benefit from religion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because some minds out there are so disorganized that essentially random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior sets are categorized as &quot;religious&quot; or &quot;rational&quot;.  I've known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, for example, who thought that deliberate &quot;rationalization&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; false beliefs was a recognized part of &quot;rationality&quot;(!).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Between the first part of your question and the rest I am not
<br>
sure what you are after.  Care to phrase it again?  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; What I'm asking for, then, is a case where religion provides a cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit to someone with moderate strength and depth of rationality.
</em><br>
<p>I don't consider whether it provides a *cognitive* benefit to be
<br>
of primary importance.
