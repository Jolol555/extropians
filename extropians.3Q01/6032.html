</em><br>
<em>&gt; has elected more libertarian state legistlators (25) in the last ten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years than any other.&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   I have to say Alaska would be the best bet.  620,000 population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not sure whether that includes military personnell.  You'd have to be

<em>&gt; home of record to get the resident stipend :)
</em><br>
<p>Residency laws, thankfully, are not written in stone. Many a state has
<br>
jimmied with its residency requirements for political opportunity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   It's arguably the best state to go it alone, geographically isolated,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plentiful rescources, not sharing a common border with the states is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helpful.  But maybe the most important part is only Hawaii has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better legitimate legal justification for seccession.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, a good chunk of NH was once an independent country as well.
<br>
See Daniel Doan's book &quot;Indian Stream Republic&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Bringing about a statewide referendum on the &quot;4 choices&quot; wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be nearly as difficult to pull off as trying to get a plurality in Wyoming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To say nothing of trying to run an independant country out of New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hampshire.
</em><br>
<p>NH has the advantage that it not only has a border with Canada, but also
<br>
controls some coastline. On a tactical basis, NH is difficult country to
<br>
occupy: heavily forested with dense cover and hilly terrain. With 1/3 of
<br>
its borders with other states being river, it would do well defending
<br>
itself. It's long term problem is of course natural resources of a
<br>
strategic nature, though it is home to the largest firearms manufacturer
<br>
in the US and is home to other defense industries... It could easily
<br>
become a gambling/banking haven, it is already decribed by Fodor's as
<br>
&quot;The Switzerland of North America&quot;. Imagine the trillions of dollars
<br>
that greedy little northeast bankers and capital venture people would
<br>
love to sock away in someplace so near.
<br>
<p>On a long term basis, I agree that Alaska is the top candidate IF the
<br>
goal is outright secession. It is very rich in resources, has a lower
<br>
population than NH, and is becoming stealthily a very critical strategic
<br>
location as the Northwest Passage is now open to commercial shipping on
<br>
an annual basis between europe and asia. Another advantage is that only
<br>
people who are interested in living lives of rugged individualism tend
<br>
to move to Alaska. You don't see many people interested in the easy life
<br>
going there.
<br>
<p>This is the problem with Hawaii: there isn't a snowball chance in hell
<br>
of it acting at all libertarian any time in the future. The dominant
<br>
group there is generally collectivist/fedualist minded asians.
<br>
<p>Secession, though, is not the primary goal of the Free State Project.
<br>
The FSP's goal is simply to tip the political balance in a state toward
<br>
a far more libertarian one, with secession only a backup if the US feds
<br>
get too fascist in the future.
