<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Recall that denial and deception are as much a part of warfare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; as weapons.  Denial and deception are seen in every species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of animal that I know of.  Let us be truthful with dealing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; truth.  When fighting a war, let us use every trick in the book.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; And invent new ones that are not in there yet.

<p>There *must* be hordes in Afganistan and other oppressed places
<br>
that would dance for joy if the Talibn is overthrown, like the munchkins
<br>
when Dorothy dropped the mortgage on the WW of the W.  For instance,
<br>
what of all the Afgan gays?  They must be quietly terrified over there,
<br>
waiting waiting waiting for *someone* to come along and end the
<br>
nightmare.  What about the women with some inkling of freedom?
<br>
What about the intellects?  The nonreligious?
<br>
<p>Seems to me that the thing we do so very well today is information
<br>
management.  There should be some way to use our information
<br>
handling skills to rip away the veil of ignorance and oppression.  I
<br>
just dont yet know how to get the message to them that there really
<br>
really are no houris waiting, that houris were invented by some cowardly
<br>
cleric to convince the young men to lay down their lives for a political
<br>
cause, while the clerics enjoy the *real* virgins at home in this life.
<br>
How do we break it to them?  spike
