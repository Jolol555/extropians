Thanks for your thoughtful and interesting response!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ultimately I expect the mobile phone to have a comparable degree of social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impact to the automobile.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, I'll grant you cellphones as a new technology with significant social
<br>
impact qualifying for &quot;revolutionary&quot; status. So, that's cellphones, the PC,
<br>
and the Internet. It still doesn't seem to compare with the incredible
<br>
number of high-social-impact inventions from about 1875-1950. And it's still
<br>
anecdotal. Is there any systematic attempt to provide a Y-axis for these
<br>
asymptotic growth charts we keep seeing? I could try to do it myself, but I
<br>
would have thought the movement would have done its own homework.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a one-off item, and not one I can put a quantitative figure on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (especially because it's a change-in-progress). But I think there are other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socially revolutionary technologies that are slipping in under the radar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that you may have missed. For example, advances in food preparation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology in factories have turned the TV dinner from a soggy cardboard-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tasting novelty into something that many people eat every day, to the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where many no longer _need_ to know how to prepare food from raw ingredients
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like vegetables, spices and a cut of meat. That activity used to soak up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe ten to twenty hours of work time per household per week -- what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replacing it?
</em><br>
<p>I considered the microwave for possible inclusion. I don't think it's as
<br>
important as the refrigerator, but it probably squeaks in under the wire,
<br>
unlike, say, the home cappuccino maker.
<br>
<p>Going to the grocery store, I don't really see a revolution in frozen food
<br>
compared with what I saw thirty years ago, at least not yet. It seems to
<br>
take up a comparable amount of shelf space, anyway. Do you have sources for
<br>
your assertion about falling cooking times?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again: the RAF noted recently that the reflex speed of new applicants for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pilot training is vastly higher than their equivalents during the Battle of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Britain -- by 1940 standards, every applicant today has the reflexes to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an ace. They blame the widespread adoption of computer games that foster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lightning hand-eye coordination skills. Who'd have expected son-of-Pong to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have serious defense implications in 1976?
</em><br>
<p>I'd like to see the sources on that one. There seems to be a very
<br>
contradictory literature on the effects of computer games. But it's possible
<br>
they could qualify as a socially revolutionary technology, yes. Software is
<br>
problematic that way. If we start counting individual program categories,
<br>
then the number of revolutions would go up. But is it really fair to count
<br>
each of games, word processing, spreadsheets, graphics, e-mail, chat, the
<br>
Web, e-commerce, presentation, and animation as its own revolution, as
<br>
opposed to part of a general revolution in computer technology? I'm not
<br>
sure. I do have a pretty strong feeling that software is starting to mature
<br>
and flatten out as far as the number of new product categories is concerned.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And what are the implications for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teleoperator-controlled surgery in, say, a decade's time, when that same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; video generation begins graduating from medical school?
</em><br>
<p>Potentially important. Medical improvements are also problematic in much the
<br>
same way that software improvements are. Antibiotics are clearly a
<br>
revolutionary technology. Techniques like telesurgery or focused radiation
<br>
treatments are harder to call out as their own revolutions, though they may
<br>
have the potential to become as important as antibiotics.
<br>
<p>The issue of ongoing incremental change casts light on a greater fuzziness
<br>
in the whole question of revolutionary technologies. We can probably agree
<br>
that from phonograph and audiocassette to CD is really just an incremental
<br>
format change and not a revolution; ditto VHS to DVD. But what about the VCR
<br>
itself? Is that just an improvement on the television that gives people more
<br>
control over what they see, or just an improvement on the motion picture
<br>
that lets people watch them at home in a way not tied to release schedules,
<br>
or should it be called a revolution based on its creation of the video
<br>
rental industry and/or its fusion of two important technologies that were
<br>
previously largely separate? What kind of metric of social change can be
<br>
used here?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All this without mentioning the Flynn effect.

<br>
<p>&quot;Intelligence scores are rising, James R. Flynn discovered--but he remains
<br>
very sure we're not getting any smarter.&quot;
