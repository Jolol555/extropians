I believe the situation went something like this.
<br>
<p>Cray found their market drying up and SGI bought them out
<br>
thinking they would be a good fit (turn old Cray customers
<br>
into new SGI (Origin) customers).  Then I think SGI figured
<br>
out the future really wasn't in supercomputers but in bulk
<br>
Linux clusters (at least for now) and wanted to unload Cray.
<br>
<p>TERA had been working on an advanced architecture and had
<br>
burned up a lot of cash building GaAs chips that required
<br>
very complex boards.  It worked but by the time they proved
<br>
it, CMOS had caught up with GaAs speeds.  So they had to
<br>
redo the architecture in CMOS to lower the production costs.
<br>
In the meantime I think they needed a revenue stream to
<br>
keep the stockholders from giving up entirely, so they
<br>
bought Cray from SGI.  SGI unloads a lemon from its
<br>
perspective and TERA gets a possible future customer base.
<br>
(Replace your aging Cray's with new TERAs).
<br>
<p>Browse on over to www.tera.com which now seems to be www.cray.com
<br>
and take a look.
<br>
<p>I agree Seymour Cray effectively was CDC as well as Cray.
<br>
His biography was a good story from my perspective and shows
<br>
what happens when you try to skate a little to close to the
<br>
edge (pushing the technology for the Cray-3).
<br>
<p>Now the really *interesting* thing in the Blue Gene article
<br>
is that IBM is designing the chip to be multi-threaded.
<br>
This allows the CPUs to service whatever thread has got
<br>
its data loaded from memory.  It sounds precisely like the
<br>
TERA architecture.  So either IBM has licensed TERA's
<br>
technology or they have reinvented something similar.
<br>
<p>But its going to be interesting -- Blue Gene is going to
<br>
push us *2* orders of magnitude in capabilities (at least
<br>
for the applications for which it is appropriate).  Thats
<br>
quite a jump from Moore's Law of 2x every 18 months or
<br>
1 order of magnitude every 5-6 years.
<br>
<p>Signs of the Singularity?  You be the judge.
<br>
<p>The article pointed out is the degree to which they are constrained
<br>
by the limit of how much memory they can get on the chips with the CPUs.
<br>
There is a match made in heaven if you can get molecular electronics memory
<br>
denisties (much greater than current capacitors) combined with CMOS logic.
<br>
I'm a lot more optimistic for the development of molecular electronic
<br>
memories than the development of molecular electronic logic. 
<br>
We shall wait and see.
<br>
<p>Other interesting &quot;factoids&quot;:
<br>
-- The cluster will be 40 x 40 ft.
<br>
-- Consuming a couple of megawatts of power
<br>
-- They are only running the chips @ 500 MHz
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(presumably to keep the heat production down)
<br>
-- If you can get a modern-day supercomputer to stay up for 100 hours
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without a hardware failure you are doing well.
<br>
-- They are going to have some way of dealing with chips
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that have defective CPUs (lowering the production costs).
<br>
-- It takes 10^23 instructions to simulate 100 microseonds of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protein folding.  (Yike's you would even have to &quot;wait&quot; for a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rod-logic nanocomputer to do the calc.)
