Lee said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Many people thus just simply can't help but think of themselves as
</em><br>
&quot;this
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Jew&quot;, or &quot;this black woman&quot;, or &quot;this gay person&quot;, etc.  (Soon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; due to demographic change, we'll all have a chance at being in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; a minority and can be distinguished by our group identity as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; well, although some, like Amish and Mormons are ahead of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; game already.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &lt;Samantha said&gt; This doesn't make any sense to me.  My problem with most
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; those who do not appreciate diversity is that they insist on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; seeing my packaging rather than who I am as a person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, it doesn't apply to you, then, if you don't so strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;identify with being a woman, or a lesbian, or whatever, to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point that it suppresses your own unique individuality.  I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grant that most of those who do not appreciate diversity will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;see you first as a whatever---but, sad to say, most of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who *do* appreciate diversity will also see you first as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whatever.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe I'm missing something, but when I say I like diversity I simply mean
<br>
that I like living in a world where people have widely different life
<br>
styles, interests, self-presentations, sexualities etc. I don't want to live
<br>
in a world where everyone is the same. I like variety.
<br>
<p>Lee seems to have expressed not so much a contrary wish to this (though that
<br>
may be what he feels) as an objection to identity politics built around
<br>
these things. If that is so I have some sympathy, though I'd say that
<br>
identity politics is sometimes necessary for people with unpopular
<br>
characteristics to pursue more tolerance, better legal rights etc.
<br>
<p>Can you clarify what you don't like, Lee? Is it a variety of different kinds
<br>
of people? Or is it the (sometimes necessary, I would say) evil of identity
<br>
politics?
<br>
