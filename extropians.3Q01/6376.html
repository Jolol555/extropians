<p><p><em>&gt;The root problem is not US foreign policy, as some here have suggested.

It'
<br>
<em>&gt;s that there is a widely distributed culture of fanaticism in the Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world. 
</em><br>
<p>### This is not the only fanatical culture. Christian sects, neo-Nazis,
<br>
eco-Nazis come as other examples.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It focuses on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but it certainly has
<br>
other objects, as well.  Consider that the savagery of the Taliban has
<br>
basically nothing to do with the on-going crisis in the Levant.  Examples
<br>
can be found from Algeria to Indonesia that have nothing to do with
<br>
Palestinian nationalism.
<br>
<p>### The Taliban are a throwback to stone age, a product of Russian
<br>
occupation and a civil war. Non-islamic regimes in other parts of the world
<br>
(Africa, formerly Cambodia, etc.) are just as virulent if formed under
<br>
similar conditions. Meanness has nothing to do with Islam itself, at least
<br>
as compared to the other large irrational belief systems. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That culture of fanaticism has secured the &quot;sacred
</em><br>
<em>&gt;high ground&quot; throughout the Islamic world.
</em><br>
<p>###Only in Palestine, Iran, Saudi Arabia, to a lesser extent in Egypt, Iraq,
<br>
Yemen, hardly at all in Syria, and other countries.  Palestinians hate
<br>
Americans because Israelis kicked them out of their home, using American
<br>
weapons and American money. Their problem is not Islam itself.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As a result, there is no secure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;middle ground in politics or culture in the Islamic world.  This is because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Islamism is truly totalitarian, or &quot;culturally hegemonistic,&quot; to borrow a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phrase form Marxist rhetoric, i.e. it makes claim to relevance to and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dominance over every aspect of life. 
</em><br>
<p>### Any political system shapes every aspect of our lives. Islam is a stupid
<br>
concoction of legends
<br>
&nbsp;and social interaction rules, just as Christianity or Judaism, but not more
<br>
pervasive in its influence on a society than e.g.American individualism
<br>
(just less fun). In fact, Islam is losing ground in competition with the
<br>
global culture (when is the last time that Moslems as a cultural group
<br>
offered anything new to the world, 500 years ago?), and that's why the weak
<br>
and hateful ones strike at the symbols of their own cultural impotence, the
<br>
WTC or the White House. Losers try to use any means they can but in the end
<br>
they will lose, and their children will drink Coke, too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Contrary to the claims of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Arab-Americans and others today, and in the days that follow, that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;9/11/01 attacks don't represent &quot;true Islam&quot;, in fact they do.
</em><br>
<p>### No, they don't. Ask Moslems in the US. A vast majority are repulsed by
<br>
the slaughter of innocent persons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And herein lies the ultimate, gut-wrenching irony and threat: Our political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and cultural leaders cannot condemn this root cause of the problem.  On the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one hand, it would likely be ineffective.  Condemnation of Islamism would
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt;interpreted by Moslems all over the world as the simple rhetoric of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inter-religious bigotry and ompetition.
</em><br>
<p>### No need to condemn Islam, just condemn &quot;jihad&quot; and &quot;fatwah&quot;. Islam can
<br>
do without these ideas, just like Christianity kept being quite successfull
<br>
even after the auto-da-fe was rejected. The images of WTC falling can bring
<br>
millions of Moslems closer to the mainstream, if the mainstream gives them a
<br>
chance (I'm not necessarily talking about the scum who danced in the streets
<br>
of the West Bank).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;On the other hand, the modern dogma of cultural relativism makes any kind
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt;public judgment of one culture by another impossible.  Any condemnation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Islam for the fertilizer of fanaticism that it is would be interpreted by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the shapers of our own culture as chauvinism.  Thus, our public discourse
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt;condemned to a fundamental impotence: We cannot as a civilization even TALK
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about the root cause of the problem.
</em><br>
<p>### Cultural relativism is old news. I don't subscribe to it, and neither do
<br>
all the shapers of our culture (aren't we on this list shapers, too?). A
<br>
dialog is possible with most Moslems and respect for innocent humans is an
<br>
idea most innocent humans can incorporate into their minds.
