Because the subject of race and racism has come up, I thought I'd post
<br>
something I've written for the updated extropian FAQ.  This text has
<br>
benefited from input from Anders and Nick Bostrom:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
<br>
What position do extropians take on racism and eugenics?
<br>
<p><p><p>Extropians place a very high value on the rights of individuals to
<br>
self-determination and self-direction. Extropianism is fundamentally opposed
<br>
to any form of racism or other judgment of individuals based on similar
<br>
specious groupings.  Extropian opposition to racism is not a function of any
<br>
kind of post-modernist &quot;politically correct&quot; cultural relativism.  Most
<br>
extropians strongly endorse the notion that the highest product of human
<br>
culture is the scientific method and that the 18th century Enlightenment
<br>
represented the real birth of a rational human civilization based on the
<br>
scientific method and a fundamental valuation of human liberty. Extropians
<br>
base their opposition to racism on those values.
<br>
<p><p><p>Overt racism and even the milder forms of &quot;racialist&quot; thinking are
<br>
inconsistent with extropian values of individualism and self-determination
<br>
and our esteem of the scientific method and world-view.  Racism and
<br>
racialism are seen by extropians as both morally wrong and antithetical to
<br>
our desire for social progress on the one hand and are also simply
<br>
unsupported by any sound scientific fact or theory.  In the first instance,
<br>
we judge individuals as much as possible on the basis of their own
<br>
achievements and character, rather than because of superficial
<br>
characteristics.  In this regard, we value diversity, especially when it is
<br>
an expression of individual personality: On both a moral and psychological
<br>
level, extropianism is a joyful affirmation of the potential richness of
<br>
human existence.  Thus, racism is the ugly opposite of the things we value.
<br>
<p><p><p>Taking a strong stand against racism and racialism is also vitally important
<br>
to extropians and other transhumanists because the transhumanist agenda of
<br>
human augmentation and transcending the human animal are sometimes confused
<br>
in public discourse with primitive notions of racialist eugenics.
<br>
Extropians oppose any program of racialist eugenics on deeply principled
<br>
grounds: They are inconsistent with the fundamental Enlightenment values of
<br>
human liberty and dignity and are not supported by any kind of rigorous
<br>
scientific theory or research.  Furthermore, the few misguided contemporary
<br>
proponents of such ideas do a grave disservice to the legitimate goals of
<br>
extropianism and transhumanism, by threatening confusion of the real goals
<br>
of the program of the Enlightenment with archaic tribalism.
