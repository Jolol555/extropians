Re:&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; Libertarians don't favor
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; outlawing stupidity, but stupidity should have its costs.
</em><br>
<p><em> &gt; From: &quot;Alex F. Bokov&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; It does, by definition, except when some do-gooder authority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; decides to redistribute these costs and protect the stupid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; from the consequences of their actions.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Olga replied:
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; I would rather deal with a do-gooder authority than a do-badder
</em><br>
authority.

<br>
<em>&gt; Disobey Acton's Law at your own peril. Government is only interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing good for itself. If anyone else benefits, that is simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serendipity, or a means to an end.
</em><br>
<p>I was being just a tad facetious (gooder/badder), but okay, I'll take the
<br>
bait:
<br>
<p>Let's see.  Government, not an amorphous being, but people = doing good for
<br>
themselves (with the result that sometimes other people [other than
<br>
government employees] benefit).
<br>
v.
<br>
No government.  Each man, woman and child left to fend for themselves.
<br>
Serendipity for the genetic celebrities.  &quot;Collateral damage&quot; for others.
<br>
Too bad.  That's life.  Ta ta.  Disobey Olinka's Law at your own peril.
