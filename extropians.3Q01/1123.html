Party of Citizens asked
<br>
<p><em>&gt;....how would Extropians define Canada's God?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know.
<br>
<p>I can report that the British Act of Parliament that promulgated Australia's 
<br>
Constitution a bit over 100 years ago refers to God. There was a lot of 
<br>
debate at the time about whether this should go in. One outcome was that it 
<br>
did but, as a compromise, the Constitution itself forbids the state from 
<br>
establishing any religion. So we have some constitutional protection of 
<br>
freedom of religion here, though it has not been interpreted with anything 
<br>
like the zeal and rigour of the equivalent in the US. Moreover, the 
<br>
restriction only applies at federal level. The states of the Commonwealth - 
<br>
the state at state level, if you like - can do pretty much anything they 
<br>
want.
<br>
<p>There's something about religious freedom in the Canadian Charter of Rights, 
<br>
too, as I recall (I'm to lazy to look this up, I'm afraid).
<br>
<p>A couple of years ago there was an attempt to change our constitution (which 
<br>
can only be done by a referendum with a majority result not only overall but 
<br>
in a majority of states) to insert a new preamble. There were many aspects 
<br>
of the preamble that were controversial, but one which caused a lot of us 
<br>
atheists to vote against it was a reference to God. The referendum failed, 
<br>
thank Ghod.  :-)
<br>
<p>In any event, I think most constitutional lawyers would say that these 
<br>
references to God in preambles, recitals, etc to the Constitutions of 
<br>
liberal democracies are just pious words, meant to give a sense of 
<br>
solemnity, with no legal force. Although I count as a constitutional lawyer, 
<br>
I haven't really researched this issue. I wonder whether Greg Burch might 
<br>
have a view.
