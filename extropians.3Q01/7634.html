I disagree with the notion that these are simple matters. I think that principles are important,
<br>
and I think that expediency is important. I agree that slippery slopes abound.
<br>
<p>Classical example: from an atheist's perspective, was the work of Galileo, Kepler and Newton
<br>
invalidated by their religious faith? Did they do it &quot;for the wrong reason&quot;?
<br>
<p>What if the rumor that Newton cooked Brahe's data is true?
<br>
<p>I think there's a transfer function here, and I think that Newton is at least slightly to one side
<br>
of the inflection point--call it the &quot;fact&quot; side. 
<br>
<p>The transplant researcher who took a black Magic Marker to his white mice, IMO, is on the other side 
<br>
of that curve. Blondlot's N-Ray work is on the &quot;fiction&quot; side, too, but closer to the point of inflection.
<br>
<p>But that's just me talking...
<br>

<br>
<p>PS: one of the thorniest problems in this area, for me, is that of raising the young.
<br>
See previous comments here and elsewhere on children as chattels.
