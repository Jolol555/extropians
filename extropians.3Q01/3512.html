Eric Chen Yixiong &lt;<a href="mailto:cyixiong@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20Extropianism%20a%20religion?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108081857.MAA03204@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">cyixiong@yahoo.com</a>&gt;,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1) A strong belief in a supernatural power or powers that control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human destiny
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is definitely a power that is taking us towards the
<br>
singularity, the best that is possible, or whatever you want to call
<br>
improvement.  Extropians believe in this very &quot;religiously&quot; do they
<br>
not!?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) Institution to express belief in a divine power
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are organization like The Extropy Institute!  But this
<br>
isn't nearly enough if you ask me!  I'm a cultural LDS (mormon) and I
<br>
would give anything to have an extropian &quot;bishop&quot; to offer moral,
<br>
emotional, psychological... help according to extropian &quot;religious&quot;
<br>
values, weekly sunday meetings where I could go and associate and
<br>
affiliate with other extropians (like extro conferences only on a
<br>
weekly bases and locally rather than only every 2 years way out in
<br>
California!), &quot;sunday school&quot; to help my children to be able to better
<br>
learn extropian values, extropian &quot;home teachers&quot; to assist my family
<br>
with extropian life issues (like helping with funerals, cryonic
<br>
preservation, estate issues...), extropian &quot;missionaries&quot; that donate
<br>
two years of there life or some type of &quot;proselytizing&quot; support for
<br>
which the goal is to &quot;spread the good news or extropian 'gospel'&quot; and
<br>
literally &quot;save the world&quot; or at least save as many as possible from
<br>
all &quot;evil&quot; (anything which anyone doesn't really want) especially
<br>
information theoretical death...  instead of &quot;baptism&quot;, there would be
<br>
such &quot;rituals&quot; as signing up for cryonics&quot;...  And we all know what an
<br>
extropian funeral should be like.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple credo would be something like unconditional love for
<br>
all and to eternally work until everyone had everything they wanted
<br>
and until then to get as close to this as rationally and as fast and
<br>
as best as is possible.  We wouldn't claim our church was &quot;the only
<br>
true church&quot; we would claim we will follow all that is true and
<br>
anything that really works at moving us closer to getting everyone all
<br>
that they want.  Thereby it would be &quot;a true church&quot; or a &quot;meta&quot;
<br>
church (how do we most rationally find out what is really true, and
<br>
follow after such!?) since even !IF! it turned out that there were
<br>
something like a real &quot;priesthood power&quot; (or say the power of liquid
<br>
notrogen cold...) that really worked or had some real utility, we
<br>
would rationally study how why and when it worked and seek to utilize
<br>
it as best as we could as yet another tool in our goal of getting
<br>
everyone everything they wanted...  (Some extropians might even
<br>
believe in such.  We would help them explore, seek after, and
<br>
hopefully fulfill such according to any and all of their true
<br>
desires...)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would all parts of most extropian's lives be infinitely
<br>
improved if there was such an organization?  My families life is sure
<br>
lacking without this!  How many of you wish there was an extropian
<br>
&quot;church&quot; something like this?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I maintain my &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;hope&quot; that there will be enough
<br>
extropians to set up something like this some day.  I guess, like most
<br>
all of us, we were just born way to early?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best definition I ever heard of &quot;religion&quot; was simply: &quot;A
<br>
way of life&quot;.  To me, extropianism is more of a !true! religion than
<br>
any other religion I know of.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What say yee!?  I say let's get out there and spread the &quot;True
<br>
Gospel&quot; and get to work &quot;Saving the world!&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Most may still worship misery, choose death, and seek that
<br>
others be miserable like unto themselves - but as for me in my house,
<br>
we will eternally choose, hope for, and seek after all that is good.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen and Glory Haleluja my beloved brothers and sisters!
<br>
