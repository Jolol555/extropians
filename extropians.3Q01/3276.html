be
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These distinctions make sense to me. Clearly not all radical futurists
<br>
are transhumanists, because some fear this future and think we ought to work
<br>
to avoid it--even if there is only a small chance that we can. I am also
<br>
inclined to think that not all transhumanists are radical futurist. (My view
<br>
is that there will be radical discontinuities between the present and the
<br>
future--a discontinuity perhaps as radical as the development of life on
<br>
this previoiusly dead planet). But some seem to think that these new
<br>
technologies will all be taken in stride. If nothing else, I suppose that we
<br>
could imagine a conservative transhumanist who wanted to initiate only a
<br>
small subset of the possible technologies, and thus, there would be no great
<br>
transformation.
<br>
<em>&gt; Traditionally it has of course been the transhumanists who have been doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of the thinking and imagining of radical futures. Recently radical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; futurism is becoming more common, and this actually poses an interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; challenge for us transhumanists: how do we justify our striving to others?
</em><br>
<p>My own view is that transhumanism is an ineluctable consequence of a
<br>
perfectionist ethics (in the tradition of Aristotle, Marx, Nietzsche, etc.).
<br>
In a more defensive mode I think it is possible to develop an argument along
<br>
these lines: Either one is a moral realist or not. There is very little we
<br>
need to do to justify our views to moral anti-realists: (simplifying) they
<br>
believe that values are a projection by humans on to the world, and the
<br>
world is value neutral. To them we simply say that ours is simply a
<br>
different projection. Moral realism looks more challenging. But once we
<br>
assert that values hold independently of the human view of them, then we
<br>
open up the possibilty that our conception of these mind independent values
<br>
is not entirely correct, or it is radically incomplete. Since it is our duty
<br>
to improve our moral knowledge where possible, and transhumanism is the best
<br>
way to improve this knowledge, it follows that we ought to initiate the
<br>
transhumanist project. In other words, if we are moral realists we ought to
<br>
be open to the possibilty that posthumans have a more accurate and complete
<br>
view of the moral facts, just as our human conception of values is likely
<br>
more developed than our more apelike ancestors.  Either way, then,
<br>
transhumanism is in good shape.  Mark
