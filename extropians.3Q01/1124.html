<em>&gt; As one who sees everything as 'simply matter and physics', I can also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stated that I most certainly don't think that doing so eliminates value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or values or the sacredness of anything. This, I find, is a primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fault of those who wax excessively about religion and spiritualism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claiming that science is no better than another superstition. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot imagine the possibility that the universe can be looked at in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely rational manner while simultaneously having a sense of awe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and wonder at it. They also have extreme difficulty imagining the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility that one could derive a set of values from objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational observation of the universe that is anything but a rather crass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and simplistic dog eat dog existence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is these cognitive failings in the religionists that I find most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; troubling, and is what I meant earlier when I said they are lacking. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take great umbrage at the assertion that I lack in a sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aesthetics, that I don't appreciate beauty or human spirit, just because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I choose to look at the world rationally rather than from a position of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superstition and supernaturalism. I don't need religion to be spiritual,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I don't need supernatural phenomena to feel at one with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe.
</em><br>
<p><p>And, of course, I know that you do see life deeply and I don't
<br>
include you or those like you generally in what I think is a
<br>
problem position that some call &quot;scientism&quot;.
