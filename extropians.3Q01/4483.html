I passed along some of the comments from the list to Dr
<br>
Vijoleta.Braach-Maksvytis, one of the world's leading nano experts with the
<br>
Aussie CSIRO. She sez:
<br>
<p>========================================
<br>
<p>George Whiteside is the leader (with ourselves!) in the field of molecular
<br>
self-assembly as it actually occurs within our current understanding,
<br>
particularly from a chemistry perspective, and nanotechnology, i.e.the
<br>
understanding of phenomena at the nanoscale dimension and mechanisms by
<br>
which nanoscale molecules interact with one another, is precisely his field
<br>
of expertise. 
<br>
<p>Splitting hairs with the ATP argument. ATPase enzyme is embedded in a
<br>
biological membrane and is driven by energy produced in the form of a
<br>
chemical gradient through the build-up of hydrogen ions, hence it is
<br>
chemical energy used to drive the rotation of the protein shaft. Magnetic
<br>
field generation occurs during electron transport, which is not occurring
<br>
during this process. 
<br>
<p>There are some very nice examples of work where part of the ATPase enzyme
<br>
has been attached to a surface and a small silicon bar or polystyrene bead
<br>
is attached to the protein rotor and the rotation of the silicon bar or bead
<br>
is observed if you supply the system with the right cocktail of chemical
<br>
ingredients. I've attached a PowerPoint presentation from a conference last
<br>
year where this work was presented, and it is worth tracking down the
<br>
groups because they give some nice moving graphics for this.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Scientists like precision in language. 1 micron is 1000 times greater than
<br>
1 nanometer, hence perhaps Microtechnology is more appropriate than
<br>
Nanotechnology. Also the NSF and other scientific nanotechnology definitions
<br>
relate to both size and also the particular properties which are observed
<br>
for material at that scale which are not observed for larger-scale, i.e.
<br>
micro and upwards, material. Hence when talking about nanobots the word
<br>
implies the nano-scale and hence the arguments against such entities being
<br>
possible at the nano-dimension.
<br>
<p>In conclusion, George does know what he is talking about with regards to
<br>
what our current understanding is of mechanisms and what might or might not
<br>
be possible based on our current knowledge of scientific principles.
<br>
<p>==================
<br>
<p>I'm in two minds about her nomenclature argument. It's true in a way that
<br>
if working bots are ~1 micron, it's somewhat misleading to refer to them as
<br>
`nanobots', even though their *parts* are nano-scale, and they are compiled
<br>
at that scale.
