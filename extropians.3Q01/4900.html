my
<br>

<em>&gt; private education).&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;   Public education DOES sanction discrimination, I never had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle who couldn't speak English properly (i.e. correct grammer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and pronunciation) while attending the &quot;intolerant&quot; private schools,
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand what you wrote.  The kind of discrimination practiced by
<br>
public schools (as was done in the past) allowing segregation based on race,
<br>
or the reading of the New Testament - that is what I was talking about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Insofar as education has become more &quot;non-discriminatory&quot; (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; official version I mean) and &quot;democratic&quot; it has commenced to suck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more and more.  This is only my opinion and experience speaking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   If you honestly believe that not discriminating based on &quot;religion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethnicity, class and what have you&quot; is worth having nearly illiterate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persons wandering about the Republic, well to be extremely nice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it..I'm split between feeling pity and revulsion.
</em><br>
<p>Are you saying that public schools should revert back to how they were
<br>
before Brown v. Board of Education? (and that that would result in better
<br>
public schools?).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    Discrimination based on religion, and class is very useful.
</em><br>
<p>Private institutions can discriminate on these bases all they want - but it
<br>
is not the appropriate for a democracy to ask taxpayers to subsidize
<br>
segregated schools and such.  The Boy Scouts of America, for instance, is a
<br>
private organization and can discriminate against gays and atheists (and
<br>
they do) - but they cannot expect to use public facilities or have public
<br>
servants do their bidding.
<br>
<p>And
<br>
<em>&gt; frankly letting private schools discriminate on any other basis,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including race should they chose to do so, is a wonderful idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If they are at serious odds with reality... then they won't suceed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in educating as well as those who are more realistic.
</em><br>
<p>Private schools are right up there with the Boy Scouts of America -
<br>
certainly, they can discriminate, and just as certainly their &quot;private
<br>
business&quot; status locks them out of certain privileges accorded to public
<br>
institutions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   If you think public education is all that... wait 20 years and look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the number of homeschooled kids who become professionals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vs. the criminal farms we have now.
</em><br>
<p>It's a continual wonder to me that I, my children, friends, acquaintances
<br>
and relatives all seem to have come out of these criminal farms unscathed,
<br>
educated and ... have even lived to tell about it.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Olga
