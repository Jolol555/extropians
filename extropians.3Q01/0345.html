<p>Err...are you sure the unshielded human body can take 190 atmospheres?
<br>
Sure, the lungs could easily be at equal pressure as outside, and with
<br>
careful preparation the stomach could too.  But what about the heart,
<br>
or even the bones (especially the more delicate ones)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The partial pressure of oxygen would need to be increased

</em><br>
<p>Or you could use some kind of ventilation system to constantly recycle
<br>
the oxygen and avoid &quot;dead pockets&quot; of air, much as they do on real
<br>
spaceships (where the unbreathable air is nitrogen and/or carbon
<br>
dioxide).  Or just put the worker in a hardshell space suit (which,
<br>
granted, one would need to build first) and use it as a neutral
<br>
bouyancy tank without the resistance of water...or would xenon have
<br>
more reisistance?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The one killer app for weightlessness that eeeeveryone wants
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  breathe fast enough.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.  Perhaps two hardshell space suits that, when in contact, merge
<br>
and melt away, reforming themselves if pulled apart?  (A single suit,
<br>
hard or soft, would probably either be large enough that gravity within
<br>
the suit would be a factor, or small enough to crimp maneuverability
<br>
and make the experience less than satisfactory for, I'd predict, most.)
