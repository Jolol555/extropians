I'm very much against arming civilians. I sincerely believe that it will
<br>
lead to more violence and criminality, not less. And I do not see how
<br>
this
<br>
automatically makes my otherwise rather liberal (European measurement,
<br>
not
<br>
US) opinions socialist.
<br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><p>I know that its the habit of a lot of people to start quoting statistics
<br>
on
<br>
this one. Some stats are valid, others are questionable. I ultimately
<br>
think
<br>
this is something that should be defended on principle. I don't care if
<br>
the
<br>
guns do cause more crime. What I do care about is my right to self
<br>
defense.
<br>
Imagine a world with no guns, where intruders now break in your house
<br>
with
<br>
knives and sticks. How do you defend yourself at that point? More knives
<br>
and
<br>
sticks? Try and figure the odds of you winning that kind of a fight, on
<br>
average, Id say 50/50 (if there is only one of them). I have a right to
<br>
defend myself using the most powerful reasonable tools allowable (no, I
<br>
obviously don't mean nukes). When someone is in my house at night and I
<br>
am
<br>
responsible for protecting my family (not the police, or Interpol, or
<br>
whomever), you can bet Ill take maximum precautions to protect my
<br>
family.
<br>
<p>Understand what I'm saying, I don't care about statistics... You can
<br>
twist
<br>
them any which way to Sunday and so can the other side. In principle it
<br>
is
<br>
wrong to remove the best means of self-defense from law abiding people,
<br>
because even if you could manage to get the guns out of the hands of
<br>
criminals (impossible), it wouldn't change my situation of defending my
<br>
family a whit.
<br>
<p>Here's the possibilities once again...
<br>
You have gun, intruder has gun.			Outcome 50/50
<br>
You don't have gun, intruder has gun.		Outcome 5/95 your dead
<br>
You don't have gun intruder doesn't have gun.	Outcome 50/50
<br>
You have gun, intruder doesn't have gun.		Outcome 95/5 you
<br>
win
<br>
<p>So if you don't have a gun, your chances are 50/50 and 5/95 your dead.
<br>
If
<br>
you do have gun your chances are 50/50 and 95/5 you win. Now you pick
<br>
your
<br>
best chance at surviving. (note: these don't count as statistics, just
<br>
basic
<br>
deduction :P )
<br>
<p>And if anyone wants to take this over to exi-freedom, Ill agree. That's
<br>
where this discussion belongs as has been stated in the past so many
<br>
times.
