</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, there's very much a philosophical basis for my &quot;aversion&quot; to taxes. I
<br>
lean very heavily towards &quot;objectivism&quot; (not Randism) for one, that should
<br>
give a large insight into my beliefs. Here's why taxes are such a good &quot;acid
<br>
test&quot; on political philosophy for me. If you were to be shown an elaborate
<br>
formula that covers entire chalkboards, but as you glance over this, you
<br>
notice that in one spot, the formula states 2+2=5. You would know there's
<br>
very little chance the outcome of the formula could be correct. I know that
<br>
taxes are inherently morally wrong, so ANY system that includes involuntary
<br>
taxes are automatically immoral. People will point to the other parts of the
<br>
equation to show you how &quot;right&quot; the rest of it is... They will show you the
<br>
&quot;utility&quot; and &quot;practicality&quot; of making the outcome 5 mainly because if the
<br>
answer is 4, it makes their work MUCH harder to paint the picture. It
<br>
doesn't matter, its a diversion, they cant make their political math work
<br>
out if 2+2=4. Thell argue that you'll just being too stringent, some
<br>
latitude must be give so that the answer is 5 sometimes. To help the little
<br>
old ladies, and the children, our plan NEEDS the answer to be 5 to make it
<br>
sound moral. Weave, bob, and evade... Its a great test for any political
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>Its not the only one. I.E. Georgia outlaws riding motorcycles without a
<br>
helmet, Florida doesn't. Since you have every right to be stupid and not
<br>
wear helmets (that doesn't hurt anyone else but the guy about to become a
<br>
small greasy smear), its a good indication that the government of Georgia on
<br>
some very basic fundamental issues believe they have been elected to play
<br>
Momma to everyone. Florida has its own issues too, don't get me wrong, this
<br>
is an example.
<br>
<p>If someone wants to argue with you about the situation, they MUST argue
<br>
about the point in question. &quot;Are taxes moral&quot; is the distilled essence of
<br>
the question. Does the answer evade the fact that taxes are collected by
<br>
force? How do they argue that theft is ok? Do they try to say taxes isn't
<br>
stolen money? This goes completely against my understanding of reality and
<br>
they will have to do some BIG time explaining to show me that one. Ill
<br>
listen, but don't be surprised at me being skeptical. Something that goes
<br>
against my logic to that extent, I will be sure to examine closely.
<br>
<p>If you cant get impassioned about political views, whets worth getting
<br>
passionate about? Look at history and notice the greatest threat to people
<br>
lives and property comes from an oppressive government. When I see a system
<br>
that includes immoral attributes, I see Hitler, Stalin, etc... and the
<br>
bodies piled high. I can very quickly turn these &quot;fuzzy abstractions&quot; into
<br>
concretes if required to bring home the importance of ideas. Distill taxes
<br>
down to its basic essence, you'll find death and destruction staring back at
<br>
you. No corporations, or crazed gunslinger has ever killed and slaughtered
<br>
on the scale that governments do. I see with every attack of my values, an
<br>
attack on the lives of my children and wife because I understand where these
<br>
ideas can take a person, and a nation.
<br>
<p>If your worried that your too extreme and that you should be more
<br>
&quot;moderate&quot;, understand that the &quot;correct&quot; side doesn't need to compromise on
<br>
basic principles. You can compromise on the implementation of your
<br>
principles, but not on their existence. If you concede they have the right
<br>
to take a single penny or second of your life, you've lost the battle AND
<br>
the war.
<br>
<p>No, I haven't discovered a perfect system, I just have discovered my best
<br>
method for determining if systems that are put forth are valid.
