<em>&gt; Debatable, JR. Many of the bin Laden types are Saudi citizens or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ex-citizens. Them being pissed at our support of the Saud family could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationally be looked at in the same light as the degree to which many of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us looked at the Communist Chinese government support of the Clinton
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Administration.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I guress there's quite a difference in the degree of extremism involved.
<br>
Didn't hear about any Americans going ape and committing atrocities in
<br>
Beijing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm sure that there are many Saudi citizens that wish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they had a process like impeachment. Only a few are evidently willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resort to violence instead. What bothers me is that they attack us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than the Saudi family itself. Why do we not see more anti-Saud
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism in Arabia itself? Perhaps it is because violence against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infidels is far more acceptable than against other believers.
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't seem likely to me that Saudi citizens were involved in the
<br>
religious fanatic terrorism of September 11, 2001. Do you think British eyes
<br>
see it like that?
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
