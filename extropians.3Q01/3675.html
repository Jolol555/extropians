<p>Then either the IQ test is measuring the wrong factor, or a whole string
<br>
of nines on the normal gaussian distribution is still insufficient for
<br>
intelligence to be the central mountain on the mind's landscape.  Because
<br>
you cannot just raise and raise and raise intelligence, including the
<br>
amount of brainpower devoted to cognitive characteristics such as
<br>
self-awareness, without affecting the personality.
<br>
<p>I personally find it quite plausible that the IQ test is useful for most
<br>
of the gaussian distribution but fails to measure anything useful or
<br>
important at the fringes, i.e., the alleged distinction between Marilyn
<br>
vos Savant and someone with an IQ of 170 would not show up in any major
<br>
way if we opened up their brainware and started measuring the effective
<br>
processing power of different cognitive subsystems.

<p>It has implications for how to find the people needed to create seed AI. 
<br>
It has little or no implications for superintelligence, except insofar as
<br>
the interaction between ever-increasing intelligence levels and an
<br>
installed base of human-universal emotional complexity has implications
<br>
for Friendly AI.
