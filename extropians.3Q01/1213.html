I haven't been able to read the &quot;Are You Living in a Simulation?&quot; paper
<br>
yet (can't locate www.nickbostrom.com) but have some comments on
<br>
Samantha's comments...

<p><em>&gt; However, I find it interesting that now and then in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; been contacted by that outside this world/sim.  If we were in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sim then a lot of systems of spirituality at least in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; esoteric details could be an attempt to express the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this world as &quot;illusion&quot; or derivative from some other reality. 
</em><br>
<p>Consider we may not be in a perfect sim. If we were in a perfect sim,
<br>
then I wouldn't expect such information to leak to humans in such a way
<br>
that they could become part of spiritual systems. I also wonder if a
<br>
perfect sim would allow people to even consider that they were in a sim.
<br>
<p>If we are in an imperfect, or in other ways limited sim, then such leaks
<br>
may be the result of tweaking the system.
<br>
<p>Perhaps we are helping to make the sim. Simplistically, maybe there's a
<br>
'seed sim' which manipulates 'basic' elements like air, earth, water,
<br>
fire. These elements aren't broken up into oxygen, carbon, etc, until
<br>
someone in the sim 'discovers' them. If the sim is imperfect, then I
<br>
would expect the folks running the sim to be observing those people that
<br>
are doing scientific experiments to be most closely watched since they
<br>
might reveal the nature of the sim. So, when 'oxygen' is 'discovered',
<br>
it's made part of the sim (including, perhaps, the past history of the
<br>
sim). (Some clues might slip thru, such perhaps as Homeric references to
<br>
the 'wine dark sea').
<br>
<p>If we consider that the sim is made only for people of earth, then
<br>
exploring and colonizing space might be a way to probe the limits of the
<br>
sim. Until humans observed the earth from space, there'd be little need
<br>
to simulate the earth itself as a planet (unless of course the
<br>
astronauts are in a sim within the sim). So the next time a colony ship
<br>
full of thousands of people leaves for Mars or whatever, take off your
<br>
eyes off the TV screen you're expected to be glued to and take a really
<br>
really good look at everyday reality and see if anything wierd happens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another possibility I toy with is that when this world goes into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity we need in good faith to make a place for those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not want to be in the Singularity for whatever reason.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want and/or need to live in a pre-Singularity world.
</em><br>
<p>Given advances in computer graphics, it seems at least possible to me
<br>
that we may be able to simulate a singularity before we actually get
<br>
one. So maybe those who want to remain in a pre-singularity world will
<br>
somehow upload all others into a post-singularity sim.
