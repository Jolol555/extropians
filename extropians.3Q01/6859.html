&nbsp;[A preliminary personal note regarding my own correspondence.  My personal
<br>
communications systems have become overloaded in the last week: I have
<br>
hundreds of messages that I'd like to respond to, but won't be able to.  I'
<br>
ve been responding to things out of order and will never get around to some
<br>
that I should have responded to - so if you've sent me a message and I haven
<br>
't responded, you might think about resending it with some kind of personal
<br>
reference in the subject line.]
<br>
&nbsp;First, I want to address a comment that Harvey made, that I think has been
<br>
echoed by gene and others, to the effect that the level of discussion here
<br>
regarding the nature of and response to the 911 attacks has not been as
<br>
well-informed and well-thought-out as we would have hoped.  I agree, but I'm
<br>
not surprised.  This list has attracted a majority of people from the
<br>
sci-tech side of the  &quot;great divide&quot; since its inception and also attracts a
<br>
pretty young crowd.  It also has a lot of subscribers who've read a lot of
<br>
science fiction, in which radical plot devices get thrown around like game
<br>
pieces in a simulation.  None of these factors is conducive to engendering a
<br>
high level of discussion about social, political and cultural issues on
<br>
short notice in the face of an emotionally shocking crisis.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;But even folks who've spent a lifetime studying history and culture, as I
<br>
have, and have read a lot of military history - as I have - have produced
<br>
some short-sighted and emotionally-driven writing in the last week.  I
<br>
participate in another forum peopled entirely by folks who have studied a
<br>
LOT of history, especially military history, and it's taken days for the
<br>
level of discussion to begin to rise to the level one would expect from a
<br>
group of extremely well-informed experts on the relevant subject matter.
<br>
(An interesting side-note, in that forum some of the most bloodthirsty
<br>
initial reactions came from some of the most left-liberal participants . .
<br>
.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;So, I'm ready to personally forgive basically any kind of idiocy that's
<br>
been expressed in the last week.  What's important is where we eventually
<br>
end up in terms of ACTION, not our initial expressions of rage or our first
<br>
poorly thought-out musings.  In my own mind and heart, I've extended a kind
<br>
of amnesty to my friends, and I urge everyone else to do the same.  I have
<br>
reasons to believe that cool heads and good hearts will prevail.  I hope to
<br>
write more about that as soon as I can find the time . . .
