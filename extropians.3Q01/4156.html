<p>Asia rejects clone nightmare
<br>
<p>Hong Kong - Many Asians recoiled in horror as Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave
<br>
New World&quot; moved closer to reality with Italian embryologist Severino
<br>
Antinoris planning &quot;designer babies&quot; cloned in the image of their
<br>
parent.
<br>
<p>Muslims in Indonesia and Pakistan, Buddhists in Taiwan, Hong Kong and
<br>
Thailand and Roman Catholics in the Philippines spoke with one voice
<br>
when they said human cloning was meddling with the laws of nature.
<br>
<p>&quot;Who do they think they are, they are not gods,&quot; said a government
<br>
official in predominantly Buddhist Taiwan, referring to Antinori and
<br>
his colleagues who said they would within weeks begin to clone a human
<br>
being, with the aim of offering hope to sterile couples.
<br>
<p>According to Antinori, the nucleus of a woman's body cell is
<br>
transferred into one of her eggs to begin the process which eventually
<br>
leads to the creation of an embryo.
<br>
<p>The embryo is then transferred into the woman's uterus to establish
<br>
pregnancy.
<br>
<p>Buddhists believe in reincarnation and according to the Hong Kong
<br>
Buddhist Association life starts when the soul reaches the body.
<br>
<p>&quot;This life is determined by what you did in your last life,&quot; said a
<br>
spokesperson, adding that the nuns and monks found the concept of
<br>
&quot;human duplication&quot; so incomprehensible that they did not want to talk
<br>
about it.
<br>
<p>Huxley's book predicted human cloning
<br>
<p>In Huxley's 1932 landmark book, control of reproduction, genetic
<br>
engineering, conditioning - especially via repetitive messages
<br>
delivered during sleep - and a perfect pleasure drug called &quot;Soma&quot; are
<br>
cornerstones of the new society.
<br>
<p>Hong Kong has banned human cloning while a draft law is before
<br>
Taiwan's parliament. Yet both are keen to develop their fledgling
<br>
biotech industries which rely upon cells taken from human embryos for
<br>
research.
<br>
<p>Draft laws are also being considered in Malaysia, Thailand and
<br>
Australia.
<br>
<p>In Indonesia, the worlds largest Muslim-populated nation with over 80
<br>
percent of its more than 210 million people following Islam, there is
<br>
little to suggest that Antinori would be able to peddle human
<br>
&quot;photocopies&quot; to infertile couples there.
<br>
<p>&quot;As you know yourself, this is an issue which is not acceptable to
<br>
religions, including Islam,&quot; said Sri Astuti Sudarso Suparmanto, who
<br>
heads the health ministry's research and development board.
<br>
<p>Pakistan, another devout Muslim country, said cloning interfered with
<br>
God's will, which was a sin under Islamic law. &quot;It should be banned,&quot;
<br>
said a spokesperson for the main fundamentalist party, the
<br>
Jamaat-i-Islami.
<br>
<p>Even in China, where the administration is devoutly atheist,
<br>
authorities said they opposed human cloning on ethical grounds.
<br>
<p>Yet despite the outcry, only Japan has enacted legislation to outlaw
<br>
human cloning, and many countries are facing pressure from scientists
<br>
to allow research on human embryos.
<br>
<p>10-Year jail sentence in Japan
<br>
<p>In May, Japan's cloning law came into effect carrying a 10-year jail
<br>
sentence for anyone caught trying to clone a human being and laid out
<br>
strict guidelines for scientists on research on human embryos.
<br>
<p>Gynaecologist and artificial insemination expert Atsushi Tanaka in
<br>
southern Tokyo said: &quot;It is horrifying to think we would clone human
<br>
beings despite the amount of negative data on cloning.
<br>
<p>&quot;The act of human cloning violates the very meaning of our existence.&quot;
<br>
<p>New Zealands Independent Biotechnology Advisory Council has warned
<br>
that legislation is needed urgently if it is to prevent such a thing
<br>
happening there.
<br>
<p>Scientists have warned that cloning humans is infinitely trickier than
<br>
cloning an animal. They fear that the by-product of creating one
<br>
healthy human child will be the hundreds of deformed or abnormal human
<br>
embryos that will have to be culled.
<br>
<p>In the Philippines, where the Roman Catholic Church has a huge
<br>
influence, bishops have equated this destruction as tantamount to
<br>
murder.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is the subject of human rights, foremost which is the right to
<br>
life,&quot; Archbishop Leonardo Legasi said. - AFP
