<p><p><em>&gt; From: &quot;steve&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:steve365@btinternet.com?Subject=Re:%20fw:%20the%20week%20from%20British%20eyes&In-Reply-To=&lt;001301c14212$ec3ab700$9aac7ad5@kearns&gt;">steve365@btinternet.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The forwarded message is typical of the opinions of a certain section of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; British society, which is, however, in a distinct minority according to
</em><br>
most
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; surveys and my own (limited) experience over the last week. I think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reflects both an anti-Americanism that is fashionable among the trendy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lefties and also a kind of soft-headed sentimentality that again is
</em><br>
endemic
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; among such people. The general response is very supportive of the U.S.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; apprehensive of what might come (for good reasons!), but increasingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reassured by the way the U.S. administration is playing it and
</em><br>
determined to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see things through. The same is true in most parts of Europe IMO. Don't
</em><br>
pay
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; too much attention to sappy intellectuals - they get a lot of coverage
</em><br>
but
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that's about it. This kind of &quot;the Americans brought it on themselves&quot;
</em><br>
stuff
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is also provoking a very hostile reaction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for the reassurance, Steve. Non-theist Americans may still conclude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that US support of Israel does play a part in why some people hate the US.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. However I would point out that U.S. support for Israel is not top
<br>
of the complaints list for many Islamists, particularly the ones around
<br>
Osama Bin Laden. They're more bothered about the continuing war on Iraq and
<br>
Western support for the House of Saud. Ironic, given that the Saudis are the
<br>
big supporters of obscurantist Islam but it's a case of people taking the
<br>
talk seriously and asking the royal clan to practise it as well. This is
<br>
also part of a recurring pattern in Middle East history where ruling clans
<br>
are attacked by wannabee replacements on the grounds that they are 'not good
<br>
muslims' - the Ottomans put a stop to this for almost 500 years but as soon
<br>
as their empire was cut up after WWI it reappeared. Steve Davies
