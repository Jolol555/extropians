<em>&gt; #6. It takes control away from physician providers. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm an admin type I want as little &quot;God-complex&quot; as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible for my MDs and DOs.  This makes it easier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to turn the screws on THEIR paychecks next year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply put, anything that can be used to lower costs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And that's how it works in the real world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cosmos help us.
</em><br>
<p>In my experience, both administrators and health-care providers are
<br>
constrained by unpredictable government and market forces. Or perhaps it is
<br>
the lack of tools that can correctly predict the short-term direction of
<br>
these forces.
<br>
<p>But then, who wouldn't benefit from a vehicle that could correctly predict
<br>
short-term directions?
<br>
<p>Anyway, current business models chant: &quot;profit, profit, profit&quot;. And so
<br>
it was that I extrapolated from a laboratory marketing model that emphasized
<br>
disposables to a biotech era that emphasized drugs as opposed to cures as a
<br>
way of maintaining a paying clientele ad infinitum.
<br>
<p>Now I need to backstep and rethink my assumptions in light of the article
<br>
that seems to indicate that hospital costs are once again increasing at a
<br>
higher rate than reimbursements for drugs.
<br>
<a href="http://seattlep-i.nwsource.com/national/40417_hlth27.shtml">http://seattlep-i.nwsource.com/national/40417_hlth27.shtml</a>
<br>
[Hospitals drive health costs. Demand for services now spurs medical
<br>
inflation more than prescription drugs]
<br>
<p>And one must factor in the increasing reluctance of medical facilities to
<br>
render second opinions to individuals who have been given a diagnosis with a
<br>
poor outcome. High utilization of expensive testing and procedures by this
<br>
transient population does not improve the bottom line. If you can't recoup
<br>
your costs plus a slim margin, then why provide the service? Hospitals have
<br>
been driven to move away from the category of a &quot;care-giving business&quot; to a
<br>
business whose goal is to provide medically indicated care that maximizes
<br>
outcome for minimal expenditures.
<br>
<p>So. Medicine no longer gives added intrinsic value to the economic equations
<br>
because one of the variables is human. Like most things in the present
<br>
climate...nothing else matters, if you don't survive the current conditions.
<br>
<p>There is a prepublication summary of a book that looks insightful in
<br>
providing some guidance in this area:

As the Future Catches You: How Genomics and Other Forces Are Changing Your
<br>
Life, Work, Health, and Wealth
<br>
By Juan Enriquez
<br>
<a href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0609609033&from=K">http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0609609033&from=K</a>
<br>
mpC
<br>
...Juan Enriquez puts you face to face with a series of
<br>
unprecedented political, ethical, economic, and financial issues,
<br>
dramatically demonstrating the cascading impact of the genetic, digital, and
<br>
knowledge revolutions on your life. Genetics will be the dominant language
<br>
of this century. Those who can &quot;speak it&quot; will acquire direct and deliberate
<br>
control over all forms of life. But most countries and individuals remain
<br>
illiterate in what is rapidly becoming the greatest single driver of the
<br>
global economy.
<br>
Wealth will be more concentrated and those with knowledge to sell-both
<br>
countries and individuals-will be the winners.
<br>
===========================================================
<br>
It seems that disparities across many parameters within First World
<br>
countries will increase...as will disparities between First and Third World
<br>
countries. So, it was encouraging to read the Wired article discussing
<br>
telemedicine.
<br>
===========================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,47098,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,47098,00.html</a>
<br>
ATMs to Automated Doctor Machines
<br>
<p>(First World application):
<br>
Members of Duke University's health plan and the Oregon-based PeaceHealth
<br>
system can review and update their medical records, make appointments, renew
<br>
prescriptions and -- in the latter program -- communicate with their doctors
<br>
over the Net.
<br>
As Mary Jo Deering, director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
<br>
Services' Telehealth program said, &quot;A screenside manner is just as important
<br>
as a bedside manner. We need to emphasize that it's not just information
<br>
people are looking for -- but a variety of connections that would link them
<br>
to their providers.&quot;
<br>
<p>(Third World application):
<br>
So in the Eastern Cape region of South Africa, for instance, there are 83
<br>
health care facilities with X-ray equipment -- but no radiologists.
<br>
&quot;The potential for teleradiology there is huge,&quot; he said.
<br>
In fact, using only digital cameras, Photoshop and an e-mail program, Fraser
<br>
has helped set up a system where South African doctors can effectively
<br>
access the medical advice they need to get the information they need from
<br>
their patients' X-rays.
<br>
==========================================================
<br>
These technologies have applications that fill the separate needs of these
<br>
diverse economies. And at the same time, they provide applications that
<br>
optimize and unify. A good sign indeed.
