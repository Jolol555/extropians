<p>You may be interested in by book by H. Roy Kaplan, a sociologist now with the

<br>
How They Won and How Winning Changed Their Lives.
<br>
<p>Also see the article:   Inheritance and Sloth by James K. Glassman, in the
<br>
October 11, 1999 of Forbes.  Some excerpts:
<br>
<p>&quot;The parent who leaves his son enormous wealth,&quot; [Andrew Carnegie]
<br>
wrote in an 1891 essay, &quot;generally deadens the talents and energies of
<br>
the son and tempts him to lead a less useful and less worthy life than
<br>
he otherwise would.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>What happens when someone gets a barrel full of
<br>
cash he hasn't earned himself? Does he work less, work the same, or
<br>
work more? The answer could affect public-policy issues like taxes,
<br>
Social Security and aid to the poor. As Warren Buffett put it, &quot;All
<br>
these people who think that food stamps are debilitating and lead to a
<br>
cycle of poverty are the same ones who want to leave a ton of money to
<br>
their kids.&quot;  Until recently, it was hard to put the question to a
<br>
rigorous academic test, but in 1991, just as he was leaving Washington
<br>
for Princeton after a stint as deputy assistant secretary for tax
<br>
analysis, economist Harvey Rosen stumbled across the mother lode -- a
<br>
fabulous pile of Internal Revenue Service data that allowed him to
<br>
perform what was close to a natural experiment, something that had
<br>
eluded his colleagues for decades. Along with Douglas Holtz-Eakin, now
<br>
at Syracuse, and David Joulfaian, an economist still at the Treasury,
<br>
he was able to check the tax returns (confidentially, with no names
<br>
disclosed) of 2,500 Americans who received inheritances in 1982 and to
<br>
find out whether they were working and how much they were earning
<br>
three years later. &quot;Think of it this way,&quot; says Rosen from his office
<br>
at Princeton. &quot;You are walking along, minding your own business. We
<br>
look at you. Then money gets thrown at you.  Then we look at you
<br>
again. &quot;What we found was that the more you get thrown at you, the
<br>
more likely you are to get out of the labor force. And, if you stay in
<br>
the labor force, you work less.&quot; The research, published in the
<br>
Quarterly Journal of Economics in May 1993, concluded that Carnegie
<br>
was right. &quot;For example, a single person who receives an inheritance
<br>
of about $150,000 is four times more likely to leave the labor force
<br>
than a person with an inheritance below $25,000.&quot; But the story
<br>
doesn't end there. A year later, the trio, using the same data,
<br>
published another paper, this time in the Journal of Political
<br>
Economy. The second piece of research looked only at entrepreneurs who
<br>
received inheritances. The question this time was whether they were
<br>
more likely to stay in business for themselves if they received large
<br>
bequests. The answer: Yes! The authors found that 32.6% of
<br>
entrepreneurs who received small inheritances were out of business
<br>
four years later, but the attrition rate fell to 23.5% for those who
<br>
received more than $150,000.  (These figures are in 1982 dollars; the
<br>
equivalent sums today are $43,000 and $260,000.) More striking, the
<br>
revenues of companies run by entrepreneurs who received bigger
<br>
inheritances grew 20% faster.
