<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; try to discuss the &quot;M&quot; word in the abstract, instead of much more

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; divisiveness, racism, diversity, separatism, zenophobia, etc.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess I have to go along with those who say that m******* is

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I agree with the not teaching morality in school point you made, its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unworkable with the public school system, but it would work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one though. On the other hand, failure to identity evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only benefits evil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no reason why public schools cannot teach children how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop their own morality and ethics. Children are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objects, not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property of their parents. It is an abuse of parental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim that parents have the absolute right to teach their kids as they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see fit. Kids are not clones, not robots. Furthermore, how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can a parent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be truly confident that their own morality or ethics are really 'true'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if their kids are not free to determine and test the truth of them for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves? As I've said many times: &quot;Virtuous behavior is only such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when it is freely chosen.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>While I do believe there is &quot;A&quot; correct morality, there is no way I can
<br>
justify using force to remove someone's property to finance teaching their
<br>
children a morality they don't believe, even if I think their wrong. This is
<br>
the inherent problem with public schools, you'll always use the state power
<br>
of force to undermined someone's choices. Private schools avoid this this
<br>
predicament. There is NO way to fund a school by forced theft and then try
<br>
to please everyone with the way you spend those funds, even if a majority
<br>
agrees. If a single person doesn't agree with the methods and things taught,
<br>
you have compounded the evil beyond simple theft, and now added a brand new
<br>
crime to the equation. Also, you stated children are not objects. Why is it
<br>
ok for the state to teach your children and not me? or the killer down the
<br>
street? or that southern Baptist next door? I mean you cant expect to hold
<br>
absolute right to teach your child can ya? Matter of fact, we need to add
<br>
Cuba, Paraguay, and Nigeria to the list of people and groups that have the
<br>
right to educate your child.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There are those of us that believe in an &quot;objective&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason. Participants in this philosophy are more then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welcome to identify an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evil and explain why it is so. Trying to obscure an immoral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act is in effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immoral. The semantic quagmire you speak of is a problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I'm not sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how to get around it as long as people of different base
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; talking. You cant agree on the definition of racism (sound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; familiar) if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cant even agree if existence is objective or relative (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on your axioms).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but this is all a matter of disagreement over facts, a sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayesian exchange. If two actors cannot agree on the facts of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exchange, then no Bayesian interaction will occur.
</em><br>
<p>My point is simply if you don't act upon what you believe to be an evil
<br>
action, when you can in fact act on it, within reason, you defacto sanction
<br>
it. The important phrase here is IF you can act on it, and IF its within
<br>
reason to do so without risking something of greater value (your life,
<br>
families life, etc...)
