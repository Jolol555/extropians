<p>I dont think Damien will mind if I tell this story.  One of Damien's
<br>
buddies is a math professor and Sci-Fi writer named Rudy Rucker.
<br>
He lives in the neighborhood, so when Damien was here Dr. Rucker
<br>
invited us up to dinner at his house.  Dr. Rucker blew my mind with
<br>
his research into artificial life, and all the other cool stuff he is in to.  I
<br>
found I had one of Rucker's books in my collection that I really like
<br>
and hadn't made the connection that they were the same person.
<br>
<p>Then I saw on his shelf a copy of Stephenson's Cryptonomicon, and
<br>
started gushing about what a cool book that was.  Dr. Rucker took
<br>
some offense to this I fear, since he and Stephenson are rivals in a
<br>
sense, both writing about computer science and mathematics.   (Rucker
<br>
is a math/comp sci professor at San Jose State U.)  Altho they cover
<br>
a lot of the same ground, Stephenson has sold a lot more books.
<br>
Fortunately for me, Dr. Rucker is a good sport.  Hes a good cook
<br>
too.  {8^D  spike
