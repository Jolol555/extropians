</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, if it takes a little longer, so what? Might it be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controllable, and therefore with results more to our liking than to that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of fate if we took our time to get it right? Joy gets listened to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because he does have real concerns. Progress is supposed to serve man,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not enslave us, improve us, not destroy us. If the myserious forces you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fear were so interested in enslaving us, I'd expect they'd do a bit
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the luddites, not just slow it down.
</em><br>
<p><p>There are no &quot;mysterious forces&quot; in what I floated and I resent
<br>
your implication that there are.  
<br>
<p>If you can slow the rate of change temporarily and impose the
<br>
right kind of laws when the people aren't really paying enough
<br>
attention and put into place sufficiently onerous enforcement of
<br>
these laws then you begin to have a chance (or believe you do)
<br>
at the control and limitation of the process.  Some of the
<br>
forces wishing for such control are not simply concerned with
<br>
better serving humankind but with preserving their own relative
<br>
wealth and power.  Others are concerned with keeping the world
<br>
within the bounds of their beliefs.
