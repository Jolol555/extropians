Subject: Land rights
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Here is a question that has bugged me off and on for years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What ways of handling property rights and especially land rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem most reasonable for people who value individual liberty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the well being of people in general?
</em><br>
<p>Contracts. Legal binding documents are for the most part a good thing and
<br>
better by far than most govermental enforcement...
<br>
<p>&lt;adverse possession snipped&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This works fairly well for small items and stuff that involves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of labor.  But what about large tracts of land, mineral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights, etc.  If a small bit of land lays unclaimed and you claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, work it, build a home on it etc. it makes sense to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it becomes yours and stays yours as long as you do not forfeit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it by abusing your neighbors in some way.
</em><br>
<p>You're actually into a couple of issues here. Mineral rights, water rights,
<br>
air rights, etc, usually belong to whoever actually owns the real property,
<br>
unless they have been previously sold to another interested party. Large
<br>
tracts of land are handled legally in pretty much the same way small tracts
<br>
are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't want to speculate on this to much because it may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been worked out well by others but I would like to have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear conception in my mind.  I think this makes for an important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political issue.  Whose land rights do I see as valid and what sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of land rights ideas do I want to propagate.
</em><br>
<p>Land rights can become an important legal issue, usually manifesting in the
<br>
areas of environmental law and zoning law. These are the areas that are
<br>
primarily used by the goverment to restrict the free and unfettered use of
<br>
land for any purpose. (It's worth noting here that restrictive covenants are
<br>
another issue and usually involve a private agreement between idiviuals that
<br>
is then enforced as a contract.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If governments can legitimately claim land rights they have a right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do a lot of other things too.  If the U.S.A. corporation or the
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; California corporation owns the lands they claim, they may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entitled to charge fees, percentages, etc. for passing through their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land.  I doubt they do because something does not seem right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I want to have a better understanding of these issues.
</em><br>
<p>I'll try at this one... if you're talking about the state goverments or the
<br>
Federal goverment, the right to use  properties owned by these bodies are
<br>
typically payed for in taxes (at least in my part of the country). If you're
<br>
talking about incorpoated businesses, a business has just as much right to
<br>
own land (and therefore charge for it's use) as an individual.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;I have nothing even remotely coherent to remark on this snipped section&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suspect groups of people have seldom work these things out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formally.  Perhaps rules have evolved as part of common law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More likely people just go and do what they think will work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for them or what they think they can get away with.
</em><br>
<p>Both of the above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, I'm open to discussion or suggestions for good reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material.
</em><br>
<p>The best suggestion I can give if you have a real interest in this is to
<br>
look into a general real estate course and then follow up with a real estate
<br>
law course.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Michael
<br>
(neither a lawyer nor a real estate agent, but I've seen both at regular
<br>
intervals)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thanks,
</em><br>
