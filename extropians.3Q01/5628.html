<em>&gt; &gt; This is exactly what my posting said. Cost-cutting alone is not

<em>&gt; Harvey, I think you are being a little harsh with regard to the management
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of large companies.  The larger the company the more inertia you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the harder it is to turn-on-a-dime.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure why you think I am being harsh.  I am not making up these
<br>
rules.  I am observing how markets work.  Companies that can't adapt fast
<br>
enough will fail.  Laying off employees without adapting won't work.  Yes it
<br>
is hard, but that is business.  If a company can't make it in the free
<br>
market, they will be eliminated.  That's just how it is.  Why blame me for
<br>
being harsh?  The market will act this way whether I point it out or not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Take the recent example of Lucent.  Once a great high-tech-company.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One whose managment failed to predict turns in their markets and bet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the wrong development path.  My understanding is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market for their primary product, telco switch exchanges, dried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up over a couple of years; and they bet that very-high-bandwidth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optical equipment would be a large market when everyone went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with intermediate-bandwith equipment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Net result -- no sales and a big bloated manufacturing force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you suggesting that they should have walked into their factories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a year ago and said &quot;Today we are going to make lightbulbs&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think not.
</em><br>
<p>Not lightbulbs, but they should expand into a market that wants to buy their
<br>
services.  Since the market doesn't want to buy very-high-bandwidth optical
<br>
equipment, they aren't getting sales.  This is cause-and-effect.  This is
<br>
not harshness.  (By the way, Lucent has other problems with their products
<br>
not working right and a lack of support.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Because of the market treatment of those misjudgments, the stock took it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the nose and then the engineer bleed started because their options were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so far underwater that it made no sense to stay.  The management at that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point is looking at having to take desperate measures or lose the guts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the company.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Management's solution -- lay off workers until your manufacturing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capacity matches your sales and sell off assets until your capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is sufficiently great that you can weather the storm.
</em><br>
<p>If they are changing their manufacturing capacity to match sales and selling
<br>
off assets, then this is what I am arguing for.  If they just laid off
<br>
workers to appease stockholders, but are doing nothing to change the
<br>
direction of the failing company, then this is what I am arguing against.  I
<br>
never said layoffs are bad.  I said layoffs without fixing anything else is
<br>
not enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The market looks for certain &quot;signs&quot; that management is doing something.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can't make clear what your long term development strategy is without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; giving the competitors an edge.  It looks to me like announcing layoffs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is one of the few &quot;visible&quot; tools that managers have.
</em><br>
<p>This is the problem.  Many managers use this as a signal that they are doing
<br>
things to fix the company.  Unfortunately, many managers send only the
<br>
signal, and then fail to really do anything internally.  My point is that
<br>
sending this signal without actually following up to do anything is
<br>
misleading.  These kinds of managers who didn't manage should not get
<br>
raises.  Only those who actually changed the company and started being
<br>
profitable again deserve raises.  The layoff is a sign that a solution
<br>
should be on the way, but it is not the solution itself.  Many managers and
<br>
stockholders forget this.  This is why they pour money into a failing
<br>
company which has layoff after layoff until there is nobody left and they
<br>
are out of business.  Then all the investors ask what happened.  They
<br>
thought the layoffs were going to cut costs.  They didn't really understand
<br>
the internals of the company they were investing in.  They assumed that a
<br>
solution was being implemented when none really was.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Its quite a bit different from the situation in which you are managing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private company or a startup where you can get all the shareholders in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; room and explain precisely what is being done.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with your assessment.  However, I am uneasy when investors put money
<br>
into something without all the facts.  If layoffs are a signal of management
<br>
changes, but you can't tell which companies are really making changes and
<br>
which ones are merely pretending to change with layoffs, this becomes an
<br>
unreliable signal.  Managers should not just send this signal, but they
<br>
should take real action to rescue their failing companies.  Layoffs alone
<br>
without change is not the answer.
