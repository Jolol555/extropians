From: &quot;Mike Lorrey&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20US%20Science%20Education%20Sucks&In-Reply-To=&lt;031a01c12ced$193109c0$e15c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">mlorrey@datamann.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Most of the countries that score higher than US kids on tests do so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically because they have a multi-tiered school system that weeds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kids out around the 6th or 7th grade, sending the achievers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; university prep high schools, and those that don't to vocational high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schools. The kids that take these comparison tests are only from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; university prep high schools, not the vocational ones, which is why they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; score so high.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I thought you were talking about specialization in US school system. Yes,
<br>
it does make sense to structure instruction according to students' aptitudes.
<br>
US science education probably would not suck quite as badly if it were not
<br>
impeded by outcome based education.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; NOTE: Just because a kid goes to a vocational school doesn't mean they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't take courses in subjects that would be considered part of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'classical liberal' education. They take core competency courses just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prep school kids do, they just take vocational classes as well, instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of taking four years of science and four years of math, they take a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple years of each and the rest in vocational classes to learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marketable skills.
</em><br>
<p>Some of the smartest kids might elect to attend vocational classes just to get
<br>
away from some of the propaganda in the liberal classes. Likewise science and
<br>
math may attract students with above average intellectual honesty, because the
<br>
grading system for math and science is not as susceptible to subjective
<br>
evaluation as the liberal arts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is one of the big problems. Teachers work to eliminate vocational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; training because of career elitism, they don't want to be seen as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'vo-tech' teachers. No teacher is less respected than the shop teacher.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He is usually seen as a bumbling hick who spends his off hours coaching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the football team.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that sounds accurate to me. Academic elitism is also based, I think, on a
<br>
hierarchy of political correctness. It's considered unintelligent to disagree
<br>
with or to criticize the dominant political paradigm. So, the bottom line is
<br>
US science education sucks because elitists who don't particularly like math
<br>
and science are in charge of the system.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
