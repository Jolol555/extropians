<p>No, it doesn't. You see, belief serves a purpose, and unless we follow the
<br>
lexicon of belief systems, discussion becomes meaningless outside the frame of
<br>
dogma and doctrine. Which is to say, you have no credibility with believers if
<br>
you don't follow the construct of their world view. What seems benignly
<br>
humorous to us can look like a serious insult to true believers.
<br>
<p>Here's a forwarded message from another debunker:

<p>________________________
<br>
<p>Hello, folks.
<br>
As the leader of Los Angeles Mensa's &quot;Epiphanies, Epistemology, and
<br>
Ample Eats&quot; SIG, I shall present the following essay as the basis for
<br>
this Thursday evening's discussion (July 12th).  Your comments and
<br>
constructive criticism are invited.  Thoughtful reflections shall be
<br>
shared with the SIG group.
<br>
<p>Cordially,
<br>
Rich Kapnick, Diplomate

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Function of Beliefs
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich Kapnick
<br>
<p>Let's review: The human brain operates by mapping its environment.  The
<br>
mapping process is a multi-dimensional &quot;sense and paste&quot; process.  Each
<br>
time there is a new experience, the brain dutifully finds the most
<br>
logical place in our &quot;mind-map&quot; that represents where this
<br>
observation/sensation fits in the scheme of the universe.  For this new
<br>
perceived &quot;reality,&quot; the brain then pastes the observation/sensation in
<br>
place.  There are no guarantees this process is accurate . . . but it's
<br>
the best we have, so until there is a better system, we are stuck with
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>Each person's map (worldview) is a sensory-adjusted,
<br>
experientially-altered opinion about the nature of reality.  Can you
<br>
imagine millions of automobile tourists trying to find their way from
<br>
point A to point B on our highways if no two maps they are using are
<br>
alike; when none of these maps exactly conforms to, or accurately
<br>
depicts, the reality of the road system; or when every one of these maps
<br>
is so full of holes it resembles Swiss cheese??  Like it or not, that is
<br>
the worldview each of us depends upon for comfort, security, and
<br>
navigation through our dangerous universe.
<br>
<p>There is one word that demonstrates, unalterably, that human brain-maps
<br>
are distorted views of reality.  That word is &quot;Picasso.&quot;  On the other
<br>
hand, of course, Picasso's brain-map may be the one perfect view of
<br>
reality, while all the rest of us house demented, distorted, distasteful
<br>
worldviews.
<br>
<p>The great truth that spawns the entire belief-system milieu is that
<br>
nature truly does abhor a vacuum.  The human brain seeks refuge from
<br>
danger, and seeks safe harbors of comfort and security.  Knowledge gives
<br>
us the power to function within the realm of safety from danger.  This
<br>
is highly desirable, lest we be devoured by a predator, for example.
<br>
So, we trust our past experiences that have taught us lessons about
<br>
coping with our view of reality.  Trusting our mind-map to navigate us
<br>
safely though the travails of life is called &quot;believing.&quot;
<br>
<p>When the brain cannot find an answer that fills one of those
<br>
&quot;Swiss-cheese holes&quot; in our worldview, the strong tendency is to simply
<br>
make up an answer that is comforting, satisfying, and seems to make our
<br>
worldview map more complete.  This is sometimes called &quot;magic
<br>
thinking.&quot;  All the world's major religions are based on magic
<br>
thinking.
<br>
<p>Since each of us takes some degree of care in cataloging our life's
<br>
experiences into a worldview whole, and since each of us has experience
<br>
using our worldview map to navigate through life, we each become
<br>
attached to our own particular map.  This map is the original security
<br>
blanket of life.  For some, our missionary spirit drives us to share our
<br>
map with others.  Our map works for us, we reason; it will work for
<br>
others.  So, we proselytize for our map.  This is selling, as we try to
<br>
convince others that our map is better than their map.  Some of us
<br>
become boorish, crass, and vulgar in our attempts to sell our worldview
<br>
map to others.  Today, we call these freaky people bigots.  In Biblical
<br>
times, they were called Apostles.
<br>
<p>In the Holy Bible, for example, (Acts 5: 1-11) we see the disciples of
<br>
Jesus attempting to convince small crowds of people to give all their
<br>
worldly possessions to them.  They tell what seems to be a fable about a
<br>
man and his wife who give their worldly possessions to the disciples,
<br>
but held back part for themselves.  God immediately struck this couple
<br>
dead.  This story is designed to scare the crowd so they will give all
<br>
of their possessions to the disciples and hold back nothing.  To &quot;buy&quot;
<br>
this story, one must be convinced there is an omnipotent and omniscient
<br>
God who is so vain that He values genuflection to Him over the very life
<br>
He has created.  So, if you don't engage in 100% selfless worship of
<br>
Him according to His rules, as revealed to the disciples, He will strike
<br>
you dead on the spot.  Many in these crowds bought this story and
<br>
filled-in part of their mind-map with this belief.
<br>
<p>In its most demented form, the mind of the bigot says, &quot;Surrender your
<br>
beliefs and fill the hole with my beliefs.  If you fail to do this, I
<br>
shall kill you.&quot;  Or, in the case of the megalomaniac, &quot;Believe as I
<br>
believe, or God will kill you.&quot;
<br>
<p>You can easily see that reality and beliefs--even when beliefs reflect
<br>
reality with some degree of accuracy--have nothing to do with each
<br>
other.  Reality is how things actually are: Beliefs are an
<br>
interpretation of how to navigate safely and effectively through our
<br>
unique, peculiar, disparate, and experience-laden world by means of our
<br>
mind-map.
<br>
<p>Beliefs are safe so long as we recognize they are not real.  We can
<br>
paste them to our mind-map as a test solution to the problem of
<br>
searching for truth.  One must be forever vigilante, however, to the
<br>
idea that beliefs are insidious.  Their metamorphosis to
<br>
reality-substitutes is effortless.  Nevertheless, a life run by
<br>
delusional beliefs is a life that has abandoned truth, honesty, and
<br>
reality.  Are you listening, Dr. Billy Graham?
