<p>You all, I hope you are right. I have sooooo much to
<br>
do! The laundry I have stacked to the ceiling,
<br>
accumulated from reading the emails from this list
<br>
(smiles), will take the next hundre years to get done!
<br>
<p>Seriously, I am enlightened. There are so many
<br>
publications that are excited about adding a possible
<br>
ten years, etc., that I am sometimes underwhelmed. I
<br>
don't mean to downplay these achievements--they are
<br>
heartier than average non-life extensionists would
<br>
think, I suppose--but after getting the gist of
<br>
uploading and the like (could we still play computer
<br>
games if we were uploaded?) I can see that most of the
<br>
ideas for immortality and great advances in biological
<br>
life extension are notfloating freely among the
<br>
masses.
<br>
<p>Are these things kept from them or do they just not
<br>
pay attention? I have friends I would love to keep
<br>
around for a long time (with their blessings) but they
<br>
know nothing of what you all speak. There are highly
<br>
intelligent people I circulate with who have no idea
<br>
what uploading is, and I didn't know about it until I
<br>
got here.
<br>
<p>Why is that? Why is this stuff not even remotely
<br>
mentioned in the news? I do ask out of ignorance, not
<br>
complaining. 
<br>
