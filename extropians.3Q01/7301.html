<p>I'm not carping here, but hey, I've watched THE WEST WING, and know a few
<br>
pollies, and I'm pretty sure that Mr Bush did not write those words (he
<br>
wouldn't have had time, apart from anything else). As Shaun notes, he did
<br>
read it with considerable sincerity. Having that skill was part of the
<br>
filter he went through to get the job, of course.
