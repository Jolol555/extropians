<em>&gt; &gt; remember that the clipper chip was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *crushed*. The fact that this idea was defeated once means that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actually going to have a harder time today than it would if it was an

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; help from the current mood, but it is not an irresistible power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OIC, in that case what you wrote earlier, to wit: &quot;Note that we now are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essentially back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; square one with the clipper chip, but now with the added feature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global prohibitions and a likely strong support from the public and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politicians&quot; no longer holds. So now we have not much to worry about. Okey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dokey artichokey. (Wish you'd settle on a single position though.)
</em><br>
<p>Sorry for being unclear. What I meant is that we now have to re-do the
<br>
process of stopping Clipper again. This time it is likely an even
<br>
nastier version of the Clipper proposal, supported by the current mood
<br>
but also hampered by its last defeat. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Although my ambitious side does like the idea of me and Max being part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the controlling group - in this case I guess that would be NIST, NSA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or some high level court - &quot;infiltrating&quot; them is of course a total pipe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dream. You won't get a chance to control a technology if you lie about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your intentions to the surrounding administration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No need to &quot;lie about your intentions&quot; -- just let them know that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represent the will of a huge proportion of the general public (which is true).
</em><br>
<p>Aha, so do you think the ACLU or EFF would be allowed to sit in on the
<br>
relevant boards? They are already well-known and have well-known views.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Remember, in our kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of society you actually have to give reasons for your actions when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do them as part of an administration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unless, of course, you're the President. hehehe
</em><br>
<p>Joking aside, what makes the US a democracy and not a dictatorship is
<br>
that you actually hold your president accountable and demand that he
<br>
justifies his major decisions. If he declares war on San Marino &quot;because
<br>
I say so&quot; I doubt he will remain in office. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Notice that this is messy, real world things that have to be done. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is no way of achiving it by wishing for the technology to be in wise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hands (and mine definitely aren't; I think I could make a fairly nasty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dictator a la Trevor Goodchild if I got the chance - don't let me!).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you're right about the messiness of the undertaking, and thankfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are many people who relish the opportunity to get their hands into this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; messy project. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we need them. Many have complained that we on this list never do
<br>
anything, but that is not really true: those who act do it outside the
<br>
list, getting their hands dirty and not having the time to constantly
<br>
comment on it. Hmm, methinks I post too much :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for you're aptitude for being a nasty dictator, thanks for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the warning, but it's my experience that folks who indulge in the kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-deprecating comments you've made are usually quite even-handed and fair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in their administration of technological change.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks, but you should see me play Alpha Centauri...
