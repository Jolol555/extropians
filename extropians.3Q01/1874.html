</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; With the Singularity so close, why would you tell someone to save

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Hell.  You do the learning stuff because it is fun and stretches
<br>
the brain.  Especially when you aren't under threat of getting
<br>
economically crushed if you don't study what the market will pay
<br>
for rather than what truly makes your heart sing.  It has little
<br>
to do with whether the Singularity is just around the corner or
<br>
not.  What do you think you will do after Singularity other than
<br>
whatever makes your heart sing?  Might as well get started.  GMI
<br>
wouldn't change that either.  As I've argued elsewhere on this
<br>
thread.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Technically and economically we can feed everyone right now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The main barriers are all political.  Waiting until after MNT is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bullshit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You still have not answer my earlier question:  how much money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you think that your U.S. government will have to spend on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 200,000,000 adults in the U.S. to provide the GMI?  Remember also,
</em><br>
<p>You are mixing apples and oranges.  GMI is not the same as
<br>
feeding everyone on earth.  The latter is a much more tractable
<br>
and cheaply resolved problem.  We already produce enough food. 
<br>
The main problems are transport, will and the politics of some
<br>
of the countries that would seize the food at their border and
<br>
barter it for arms letting their people starve.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; that we have now learned (thanks to Chris Rauch this morning 10:01am)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that about one-fourth of the populace would quit working within a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year, and that many more might have less incentive to work if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **thought** that a lot of lazy people were getting a free ride?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I hate to break this to you but we don't need one fourth of our
<br>
population working fulltime with the level of automation we
<br>
have.  At least that many are doing make work effectively
<br>
because we can figure out how people can have any dignity and
<br>
reasonable income otherwise.  At least this is sure the way it
<br>
looks to me having been inside a lot of corporations and more
<br>
than a few factories in my life.  
<br>
<p>There is no need to think of it in such terms at all.  It is
<br>
only possible to think of it thus when work is seen as something
<br>
onerous that you are unfairly doing while others loaf.  
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; People like Bill Gates now have wealth that is on the order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; of 10^7 times as much as some poor person needs to sustain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; life.  Maybe it would be best to wait until that figure gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; to 10^12 or 10^13, because then a number of compassionate rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; people will simply fund a minimal standard of living for everyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; This should occur as we approach the Singularity, and we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; the onerous stealing from the rich to give to the poor (by force).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In the meantime what?  Starvation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you have any idea of how many people each year starve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to death in the U.S.?   Hint: do you think that it reaches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the newspapers when an elderly person trapped in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apartment actually does?  About how many children in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. starve to death each year?  Is the GMI really needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to prevent starvation?
</em><br>
<p>That was not the question.  The question is, what do you propose
<br>
as more people simply aren't needed in a modern hi-tech
<br>
economy?   How do you propose to handle the problem?
