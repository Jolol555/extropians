<em>&gt; Olga, I'm going to try and be gentle about this.  Your 'bold' (I'm being
</em><br>
nice) message fired up my juices.  The stupid American adults you alluded to
<br>
are probably loaning your country money.  If we are so crummy and uneducated
<br>
why do we repeatedly lead the world along intellectually, scientifically,
<br>
philosophically, politically....and most importantly, creatively.
<br>
<p>But, Robert, I AM an American.  I love many things about America.  There are
<br>
statistics that compare Americans students' and adults' general knowledge
<br>
about math and science compared to citizens of other countries, and we don't
<br>
fare too well.  (I don't have the statistics in hand at the moment, but
<br>
there were a slew of articles about this a few years ago - regarding an
<br>
inverse proportion of science/math knowledge to churchgoing - the U.S. was
<br>
down in the former and up with the latter along with Northern Ireland, if I
<br>
recall correctly.)
<br>
<p>Hey, America is cool.  America is also a &quot;brain&quot; magnet.  Because of that,
<br>
we've profited from many talented immigrants who've helped us prosper, as
<br>
well.  Even thought I was relating my experiences of going to school in Rio
<br>
de Janeiro as a child, in the travels I've done throughout my life I've
<br>
observed how many children around the world do seem to take their studies
<br>
more seriously - who knows why?  For certain, children of other countries
<br>
seem to know much more about America than our children seem to know about
<br>
other countries - but that's probably because of America's popularity on the
<br>
world's stage.  We're no slouches, by any means.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am SICK and TIRED of people bashing Americans and our educational
</em><br>
system!  You get what you put into it, on an individual basis.
<br>
<p>I agree with you about &quot;what you put into it.&quot;  And I am grateful that we in
<br>
America can bash, politicians, our educational system, or anything else.
<br>
Hooray for the First Amendment!
<br>
<p>Olga
