<p><em>&gt; Remember - whites profited from UNPAID slave labor for hundreds of years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When a tourist goes to visit the White House, it is rarely mentioned - if at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all - that it was built with unpaid slave labor.  How shameful - both this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historic fact, and the fact that not many people are aware of this.
</em><br>
<p>You are quite wrong.  I don't think I've ever meant anyone so
<br>
ignorant of history as to be unaware of slavery.  It's usually
<br>
put forth as the reason that the Civil War was fought, &quot;to free
<br>
the slaves&quot;.  Abraham Lincoln is probably best known &quot;for freeing
<br>
the slaves.&quot;   Okay :-)  maybe you didn't hear this growing up
<br>
because you weren't here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Thomas Sowell documents in excruciating detail the horrible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; results of affirmative action ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Washington, D.C.).  Khalea told her parents that only the other three other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black girls in her class were ever made to take &quot;time out&quot; (for disciplinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons) - the white girls, never..When the teacher was asked whether she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought it was odd that only the black girls and none of the white girls
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were ever made to take &quot;time out&quot; for discipline, the teacher's response was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, no, she didn't think it was odd at all.  The teacher justified it, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, by explaining that, &quot;Studies show that black parents rear their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children to be more aggressive.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>It could very well have been that this teacher was picking on
<br>
these girls because of their race.  But when I taught school,
<br>
of the three black girls in my 4th grade class, two were the
<br>
biggest troublemakers (among the girls).  The other one, Renee,
<br>
was as conscientious as any girl or boy there.  I'm certainly
<br>
no racist (to the degree of pre-judging individuals, that is).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If Thomas Sowell says that racism doesn't exist in the U.S.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he's lying in the grunt (and I'm certain he gets paid very well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to tow that line, if that's what he says ...).
</em><br>
<p>By no means does he say such a thing!  No one denies that racism
<br>
exists.  But some people call racist the belief that not all groups
<br>
are exactly equal to all other groups in every way, or that people
<br>
have a built-in (but not necessarily strong) preference for people
<br>
that resemble themselves.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There seems to be so much concern about a little tax money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to undeserving, lazy, good-for-nothin's among some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you.
</em><br>
<p>Some people have said that, not me.  I just don't want to make
<br>
a bad situation worse.  Do you appreciate that welfare actively
<br>
makes some bad situations worse?
<br>
