from the sky (only literally so, and then they eat you), they evolve in

increments, generate spinoffs and generically change the shape of the

<p>This is what makes Diamond Age so wildly implausible, since conservative.

Reality doesn't have to comply with selling futuristic dead tree to a

<p>There are two major points against your scenario. A brute force, explicit
<br>
upload, where the hardware layer is simulated with ridiculous detail and
<br>
precision will be a 100% genuine article. If you were turned into one
<br>
overnight, you wouldn't notice a damn thing, and not because of edits. In
<br>
fact, this is the very definition of an upload of sufficient fidelity.
<br>
<p>There are reasons as to why first uploads must be explicit, and hence
<br>
require lots of hardware, being ridiculously inefficient. However, you can
<br>
use them as a point of departure towards reencoding you by incremental
<br>
abstraction of unnecessary details, making you more compact and much, much
<br>
faster, eventually perhaps achieving a speedup of up to a million to
<br>
realtime, while fully retaining the essence.
<br>
<p>Here's where the second argument starts. A time flux difference of merely
<br>
1:1000 will make you effectively a statue. You would have to drop out of
<br>
anything you're embedded in. The world would move on. Notice many statues
<br>
still standing around, which are in one piece? The world doesn't take
<br>
kindly to statues, especially if they occupy scarce space, and are edible.
<br>
<p>Everybody in a culture will be forced to be running at roughly the same
<br>
speed, which will be very hard at the limit of what red hot glowing (or
<br>
ultracold)  computronium can deliver. Of course you can drift off in a
<br>
slowtime bubble if you go diaspora with slightly subluminal speed, but if
<br>
tech hasn't plateaud yet chances are you will be overtaken in transit and
<br>
arrive in a system which is already taken, and which had several
<br>
subjective megayears to evolve from you. Aliens will be us, or at least
<br>
such encounters will be indistinguishable from encounters with aliens.

<p><em>&gt; serve as a content provider, to help the uploaded mind try

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Remember the last time you developed a wild crush on another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person?  Perhaps you didn't even know why.  She [or he] just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did it to you for some strange reason, she simply knew how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tweak your knobs, she caused your testosterometer to peg.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You may have behaved in odd ways that you yourself did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not understand.  I can easily imagine an uploaded mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missing that feeling, discovering that it couldnt go there, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanting to.  spike
</em><br>
<p>What do you think is the basis for that mysterious crush? It's just
<br>
molecules in motion. Altered mind states are essentially trivial to
<br>
achieve once you have your brute force upload in the box. This is your
<br>
brain on AR, and all that.
