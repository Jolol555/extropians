never had the need for 'chieftans'.

<p>In the case of your amazon chiefs, if they did in fact father most of

the offspring, then the 'tribe' is little more than a polygamous family.

How much 'enormous power' do they exert? Did they do so before they

acquired metal technology?
<br>
<p>### Well, it's quite a power if they can control access to females. Most
<br>
tribes are extended families, with a much higher level of consaguinity than
<br>
we find in modern societies. Inca rulers (the &quot;Incas&quot;) would have 500 - 800

wives, if I remember correctly, well before contact with Europeans brought

them steel.

<p>Cheiftans typically gain power where population pressure due to
technology exceeds local ecological capabilities and conflict for
resources results.
<p>Also look at the early Icelandic culture, which had no chieftans, yet
lived a herder / fisherman lifestyle without nomadism and retained a
hyperdemocratic proto-libertarian form of government
<p>### I agree that the way a so called &quot;primitive&quot; society develops can be
pretty varied, with large differences in the frequency of violent behaviour,
at least as described by anthropologists. Sometimes, uncommonly, a more
egalitarian culture forms (Icelanders, but then they were a select
population - emigrants from a land where kings emerged to rule a previously
free tribal culture, people who hated being ordered about in the first
place, were literate and had a strong tradition of independence), sometimes
it's a violent, man-eating (literally) tyranny (Anasazi, Asmati, Assyrians -
just to start with the first letter of the alphabet). The latter is indeed
more likely to develop wherever there is population pressure - that is,
almost everywhere. Only after a long period of barbarism do the nicer ideas
develop.
<p>The natural state of humanity is a life nasty, brutish and short, going all
the way back to the Neanderthals (with many archeological sites showing
presumptive evidence of cannibalism).
