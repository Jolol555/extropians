<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Samantha and Amara have defended spirituality, synchronicity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and (I think) religiosity.  I want to get down to the truth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of what's really going on here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Why do some people gladly debunk what they see as clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;    falsehoods where others, equally skeptical, don't want to?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha provided the helpful answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; b) perhaps we don't consider skepticism inherently and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unquestionably true or good for all purposes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would you elaborate?  Now I'll admit that there are many ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day-to-day situations in life where *speaking* skeptically isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the point, e.g., your boss tells a funny but highly improbable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story, your brother tells your sister that the meatloaf was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superb, or you visit a friend's church just out of curiosity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Skepticism as a philosophical position holds that doubting
<br>
everything is good and further that there is no reason to really
<br>
believe much of anything.  Most &quot;skeptics&quot; don't go that far.  I
<br>
don't believe science and critical inquiry that affirms only
<br>
scientific methodology has a good handle on the many things that
<br>
simply are not addressed by science like values and ethics,
<br>
esthetics,  qualia and so on. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; But I care a lot about what I think, and I can't think of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason not to have a skeptical attitude about what is and what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not to be believed.  You probably also care a lot about what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think.  Don't you ALWAYS want to be skeptical of memes as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you encounter them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Why do the latter embrace terms, e.g., &quot;spirituality&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;    &quot;synchronicity&quot; overwhelmingly used by people who mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;    things completely different from them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; About the latter question, there is no shortage of words and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; phrases in English to distinguish shades of belief.  Articulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; people could easily always find suitable substitution phrases---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; but they didn't do so, and mostly resist doing so.  Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Because what I am speaking of is spiritual in the truest sense I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know and to call it anything else is imho improper.  It is also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; essential if one is to reclaim spirituality from the worst of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the luddites and from the conceptual shrinking it into something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; easily dismissed that too easily misses and disowns what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; believe is important in it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think that terms are often worth fighting for.  But I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wax sympathetic here by giving a very parallel case of my own,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where, perhaps it turns out that I'm doing the same thing as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are---or perhaps not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If I didn't think the area referred to contains vastly important
<br>
actualities and possibilities I wouldn't fight for it either.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think that it's best to admit that we have &quot;free will&quot;.  True,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am a strict materialist who thinks even people and complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer programs are entirely mechanical.  So why &quot;free will&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I say that it's simply easist to go on saying that we have free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will---and so does an extremely complicated program when it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weighs a lot of evidence and finally comes to a decision, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as soon as we start saying that we *do not* have free will, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are beset by all sorts of difficulties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am not sure even in my most materialistic periods that I
<br>
believed that anything much is &quot;entirely mechanical&quot;.  I can't
<br>
attach a lot of semantic meaning to that phrase.  It seems like
<br>
something that went out with Newtonian physics.  The universe is
<br>
build up from some pretty un-mechanical (in the sense of being
<br>
pretty unpredictable in detail although so in aggregate -
<br>
generally speaking).  Chaotic systems are not exactly
<br>
classically mechanical.  Beings who incorporate states that we
<br>
have very little (so far) understanding of and act from them and
<br>
even wierder things within qualia sure don't look very
<br>
mechanical or behave very mechanically.  A system that makes
<br>
choices among complex alternatives and generates new
<br>
alternatives based on the manifold of its knowledge, goals,
<br>
desires and so on is extremely unpredictable and full of
<br>
surpises.  I have a hard time calling that &quot;mechanical&quot;.  As we
<br>
cark ourselves into greater intelligences and open up ever more
<br>
possibilities for ourselves is all that change and all of those
<br>
new options and which ones which of us will explore when and how
<br>
all mechanically determined?  If so then it is fatuously so
<br>
because it lends little to our ability to understand what is or
<br>
will be.   It is almost one of those unfalsfiable theories.  
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Now (thinking out loud here) is your case parallel?  Perhaps it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is.  Right now I can't think of why it's not.  Can anyone?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not sure as I'm not sure of the parallel you are drawing.  I
<br>
hold spirituality both because I find it very beneficial
<br>
personally and believe it is can or will be beneficial more
<br>
globally and because I personally experience much of what is
<br>
within it as deeply true.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now a semanticist might retort, &quot;because the term in question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; has so many favorable semantic links, that it's very useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; for the purposes of communication&quot;.  But if this were the case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; then you'd see people who use terms like &quot;God&quot;, &quot;spirituality&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and &quot;synchronicity&quot; qualifying their remarks.  In other words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the terms would always be followed by words like &quot;in the sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of...&quot;, or &quot;-like&quot;, or surrounded by scare-quotes.  But it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't happen.  Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whenever I mention free will, it is ALWAYS in a context that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allows me to thoroughly separate myself from people who believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in souls, and I vigorously criticize non-materialist beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how that is particularly necessary to pointing out
<br>
the obvious value of freewill beliefs and its probably factual
<br>
nature.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; That's maybe what is not parallel in our cases.  Do you actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separate yourself from all those &quot;luddites&quot; as you called them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by also ALWAYS disparaging their beliefs while putting forth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own about &quot;spirituality&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't find &quot;disparaging&quot; their beliefs very fruitful often. 
<br>
What I attempt to do instead is to show how what is really
<br>
important to them in their beliefs leads to different
<br>
conclusions than they might have had before or in the case of
<br>
their hopes and dreams for a better life and such, how those
<br>
hopes can be actually fulfilled rather than just hoped and
<br>
prayed for.  Not that I have anything against at least some
<br>
types of prayer.  They can knit together a person's
<br>
understanding, acceptance and determination and so on when done
<br>
in some fruitful ways.  So no, I don't go out of my way to
<br>
disparage others.
<br>
<p>I count on what I am saying and doing to distance myself from
<br>
others who consider themselves spiritual but who are doing
<br>
things that are actually pretty befuddled at best and filled
<br>
with hatred and bigotry at worse.  Where I can get an audience I
<br>
try to show them that their own religion doesn't actually call
<br>
for or justify such actions and stances and attempt to get them
<br>
to look again.
<br>
<p>Now sometimes it is necessary to say that what some of them is
<br>
doing is evil and wrong-headed and to make no bones about that. 
<br>
But for it to be effective you must also understand their world
<br>
a bit and say it in a way that penetrates that world.  
<br>
<p>When I was in my teens and a freshly minted uber-atheist, I used
<br>
to spend a lot of time trying to persuade people of the error of
<br>
their ways.  I found that with a lot of patience and empathy
<br>
many people can be at least partially reached that you would not
<br>
think could be.  
<br>
If I came on hard instead of starting where they were and
<br>
working  out from that I got immediately cut-off from
<br>
consideration. 
<br>
<p>But sometimes the best of them would say, &quot;You've shown me a lot
<br>
I can't argue with but in my heart I still believe I must follow
<br>
this way although I will probably follow it differently now&quot;. 
<br>
At the time I look at that as being stubborn and irrational. 
<br>
Now I am not so sure.
