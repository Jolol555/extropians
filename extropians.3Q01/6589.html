<em>&gt; Excellent. We're talking about ground troops, then. Because the sigint is

</em><br>
<em>&gt; it apart from innocents, and you can't send in robotic fighters to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slaughter them. So, uniformed people have to do it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, we're talking about more body bags. How many more body bags do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think the U.S. will tolerate, especially after what has happened?
</em><br>
<p>This is a good question and one I am sure that the war planners are asking
<br>
themselves.  But I believe the American public is absolutely ready to accept
<br>
very significant numbers of war deaths IF it is seen as part of a campaign
<br>
that could realistically address the terrorist threat.
<br>
<p>America lost 400,000 soldiers during World War II.  By all accounts the
<br>
national mood today is much the same.  I believe that people are ready
<br>
to accept thousands or even tens of thousands of our young people dying;
<br>
I don't know about hundreds of thousands though.  Some 58,000 died in
<br>
Vietnam and that was too many, but it was seen as a war where we had no
<br>
real national interests.
<br>
<p>We may also face tactics of brutality never seen before in warfare.
<br>
Iran kept America hostage and helpless for over a year by holding and
<br>
torturing 52 civilians.  In Somalia, dead American bodies were dragged
<br>
through the streets by cheering crowds, and the US ran.  These successful
<br>
precedents are an obvious thing for the enemy to try, and we must be
<br>
prepared to face such atrocities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to ask to know that Germany as a member of NATO will get very cold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feet when we're talking about 10 dead young men.
</em><br>
<p>This demonstrates a vast difference in the psychology of our two
<br>
countries today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For obvious reasons purely technological warfare against a small group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremists hiding in what is one of the poorest, most abused nations in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world (starting with the British involvement, as Charlie so helpfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointed out) is atrocious.
</em><br>
<p>I simply think it would be ineffective.  Afghanistan is a sparsely
<br>
populated country with extremely rugged terrain.  The US has only so
<br>
many cruise missiles.  We don't have the resources or materiel to bomb
<br>
every square inch of the country even if we thought that would accomplish
<br>
something.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You will get your war. There's no need asking for it extra, the people on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the street are clamoring for it loud enough. At this point every sane and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational person should not only stop amplifying hate but try to spread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information and moderation amongst those who are willing to listen.
</em><br>
<p>I just hope that Americans are going into this with their eyes open.
<br>
Afghanistan is not southern Iraq.  It's not going to be a repeat of
<br>
the Gulf War.  The Afghans successfully fought off the Soviet army for
<br>
many years.  The mountain terrain makes it hard to use the tank columns
<br>
that were so successful in Iraq.  It promotes hit and run, guerilla
<br>
style attacks.  In ten minutes the attackers can be gone and you'll
<br>
never find them.  It looks to me like a ground battle in Afghanistan
<br>
would have a lot more in common with Vietnam than Iraq.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Retaliation always overshoots, and this time it looks it will overshoot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very badly. Try to limit the damage.
</em><br>
<p>It is encouraging that even Pakistan is agreeing to go along with the
<br>
coalition.  Hopefully the need to retain international consensus will
<br>
keep the attacks focused and prevent it from turning into a massacre
<br>
of civilians.
