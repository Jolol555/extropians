<em>&gt; &gt; Here in the US, the income tax, which was first instituted for the

<em>&gt; &gt; civil war, then for WWI funding, was always, and is today, a voluntary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system for most people [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since I'm the author of the SSN FAQ, I have people telling me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time.  Do you know of anyone who has won this point in court?
</em><br>
<p>I've *heard* of people who have, but I've never seen any believable
<br>
documentation. Certainly there are no published opinions. The explanation
<br>
given by the people who advertise in magazines and the Internet (&quot;get out of
<br>
paying taxes--legally..send us $350 for complete instructions&quot; is that the
<br>
government is afraid to try such cases in court and therefore dismisses
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>There ARE plenty of published cases where the tax evader had his or her
<br>
property taken and, in some cases, spent time in prison. Here's the typical
<br>
sequence of events I've seen:
<br>
<p>1. Citizen does not file tax return for calendar year 20XX.
<br>
<p>2. A few years down the road, IRS sends citizen a &quot;Dear Taxpayer&quot; letter
<br>
requesting that they file the return for 20XX.
<br>
<p>3. Taxpayer ignores the letter, or sends a response saying that he or she is
<br>
not obligated under the laws of the US to pay taxes or file a return.
<br>
<p>4. Citizen gets a letter from IRS stating that IRS is auditing the citizen's
<br>
tax return for the year 20XX. What? But I didn't file a return! says the
<br>
citizen. No problem, says IRS, we prepared one *for* you.
<br>
<p>5. Citizen ignores IRS request to come in with financial records for the
<br>
year 20XX. At this point, IRS can either estimate the tax, based on prior
<br>
tax returns or W-2's and 1099's they've received from employers or clients;
<br>
or IRS can issue a summons and subpoena duces tecum to *compel* citizen to
<br>
show up and produce all documents relating to income and expenses, etc. etc.
<br>
for the year 20XX. Citizen will be held in contempt and fined for each day
<br>
he or she fails to comply; and/or citizen may be incarcerated.
<br>
<p>6. If they smell blood, IRS will do some detective work, track down credit
<br>
card expenditures, bank accounts, vehicles, real estate--not only does this
<br>
give them information on assets to be seized. It also allows them to
<br>
reconstruct income, which can be difficult to do for someone engaged in a
<br>
business where many of the transactions are in cash(in the literal sense of
<br>
cash).
<br>
<p>7. In most cases, IRS prefers to file civil cases against citizens rather
<br>
than criminal cases, because in civil cases the burden of proof is on the
<br>
citizen to show that the figures IRS has come up with are not accurate. This
<br>
means IRS can come up with a tax liability based on really flimsy &quot;evidence&quot;
<br>
and the citizen must then try to dig up whatever he or she can find to try
<br>
to prove IRS is wrong. (the The *Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and
<br>
Reform Act of 1998* places the burden of proof on IRS in a few, very limited
<br>
circumstance).
<br>
<p>Bankers are scared shitless of IRS and would not even *think* of refusing to
<br>
honor an IRS levy on a customer's account. And just *try* to sell your land
<br>
with a tax lien on it. Practically speaking, the only way to get out of the
<br>
system is to get *all* the way out by not earning any income. If enough
<br>
people would do this for just one year, they could bring about a substantive
<br>
change in the tax laws. But most US citizens are up to their eyeballs in
<br>
debt and can't afford to live without an income for even a month.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the government enforces the tax laws using courts, police, and jailing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who fail to comply.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  In what sense is it voluntary?  Perhaps you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean (as some of the people who write to me say) that the IRS and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; courts are misinterpreting the law.  That's still the way they enforce it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as far as I can tell.
</em><br>
<p>Yep. The law is as the courts interpret it.
<br>
<p>Tax laws are worse than merely compulsory, though. They are so complicated
<br>
that no one understands them, least of all the legislators. (I've heard
<br>
members of the House Ways and Means Committee debating a provision having to
<br>
do with depreciation, and it was clear that some of them *didn't understand
<br>
what depreciation is*!) The complexity and ambiguity seem to be particularly
<br>
horrendous in laws affecting businesses. Until a certain provision is tested
<br>
in court, the business owner is operating blind, hoping for the best. Even
<br>
after there's a decision in the Court of Appeals for the appropriate
<br>
circuit, there's the chance the US Supreme Court will later overturn it (and
<br>
the Tax Court sometimes comes up with conflicting opinions).
<br>
<p>Whether or not one believes that taxation is appropriate or desirable, one
<br>
would do well to seriously consider the benefits of scrapping the income tax
<br>
(and also social security and medicare, which are also, practically
<br>
speaking, extremely regressive income taxes that have the net effect of
<br>
taking from the poor young and giving to their relatively rich elders).
<br>
<p>RE: TALKING TO THOSE WHO REPRESENT US IN CONGRESS
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I regularly phone up my Congressman's office (Ron Paul, who, incidentally,
<br>
voted AGAINST the ban on cloning research.) and talk about this, and he has,
<br>
in fact, made efforts to introduce bills to abolish the income tax.) My
<br>
experience is that if you make phone calls IN ADDITION to writing
<br>
letters--so that the people in your Congressman's and Senator's offices
<br>
recognize your name--you have a greater impact than if you do only one or
<br>
the other. I don't think they pay much attention to email. I urge everyone
<br>
to take the time to make phone calls and write letters.
