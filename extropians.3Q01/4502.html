</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AK Steel and AgION Technologies don't think so.  They note that the

<em>&gt; antibiotic pills your doctor gives you to fight infection are organic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; microbials.  These attack one particular &quot;site&quot; on the targeted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organism.  Inorganic microbials like AgION's silver zeolite, on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other hand, attack multiple sites.  That's important because, as AK
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Steel explains in a backgrounder on the subject, &quot;resistance occurs when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a microorganism develops a mechanism to counteract the mechanism used by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the antimicrobial.  For example, resistance to penicillin was caused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when certain strains of bacteria produced an enzyme that clipped the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; penicillin molecule in half, rendering it ineffective. The probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of developing resistance to a single mechanism used by an antimicrobial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is much higher than that of developing resistance to the multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms employed by inorganic antimicrobials.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that there already exist bacteria that are silver resistant;
<br>
they live in waste water from silver mines and protect themselves by forming
<br>
silver crystals in a controlled manner (see below).
<br>
<p>But that is not likely a major problem. The basic idea of the coating seems
<br>
good. There are also bactericidal glasses that might be used at least in
<br>
surgical applications. I guess one has to update the protection from time to
<br>
time when plasmids with resistance start to spread, but that is just good
<br>
for business :-)

2. MATERIALS SCIENCE:
<br>
SILVER-BASED CRYSTALLINE NANOPARTICLES FABRICATED BY BACTERIA
<br>
Heavy metal ions are usually toxic to biological systems,
<br>
although certain heavy metal ions, in trace quantities, serve as
<br>
enzymatic catalyst cofactors. Silver is highly toxic to most
<br>
microbial cells and can be used as a biocide or antimicrobial
<br>
agent. It has been reported, however, that several bacterial
<br>
strains are silver-resistant and may even accumulate silver at
<br>
the cell wall to as much as 25 percent of the dry weight biomass.
<br>
... ... T. Klaus et al (4 authors at Uppsala University, SE)
<br>
report the biological synthesis of silver-based crystals in a
<br>
bacterial species, the authors making the following points:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The authors report the biosynthesis of silver-based
<br>
single crystals with well-defined compositions and shapes, such
<br>
as equilateral triangles and hexagons, in the bacterium
<br>
Pseudomonas stutzeri AG259, a bacterial strain originally
<br>
isolated from a silver mine. The crystals were up to 200
<br>
nanometers in size and were often located at the cell poles.
<br>
Electron microscopy, x-ray analysis, and electron diffraction
<br>
studies established that the crystals comprise at least 3
<br>
different types in both whole cells and thin sections.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) In contrast to many other metal-resistant bacteria, for
<br>
which efflux of toxic ions is the main detoxification mechanism,
<br>
the majority of the accumulated silver in P. stutzeri AG259 is
<br>
deposited as particles in vacuole-like granules between the outer
<br>
membrane and the plasma membrane (periplasmic space). X-ray
<br>
analysis shows silver and sulfur in the proportion 2:1, thus
<br>
suggesting Ag(sub2)S (silver sulfide). The electron diffraction
<br>
pattern suggests acanthite, a stable crystalline form of silver
<br>
sulfide. The authors suggest the formation of acanthite crystals
<br>
may be caused by a reaction of silver particles with H(sub2)S gas
<br>
produced by P. stutzeri.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The authors conclude: &quot;Metal-insulator composite
<br>
materials have interesting optical and electrical properties that
<br>
favor their application in microelectronics, for example, or as
<br>
functional optical thin-film coatings. The possibility of
<br>
synthesizing metal particles directly in an organic matrix points
<br>
toward new uses of metal-containing bacteria as precursors in
<br>
thin film and surface coating technology, for which a composite
<br>
or *cermet structure can yield controlled optical, electrical,
<br>
and other properties.&quot;
