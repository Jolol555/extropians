LONDON (Reuters Health) - No need to worry any longer about the surgeon's hand
<br>
shaking during delicate brain surgery--intelligent robots are set to take
<br>
over.
<br>
<p>The nerve-tingling prospect was put forward by UK-based Armstrong Healthcare
<br>
Ltd., which claims to have developed the world's first intelligent robot for
<br>
image-guided surgery.
<br>
<p>Unveiling its ``PathFinder'' robot at a news conference in London, the firm
<br>
said it would provide surgeons with a way of guiding instruments very
<br>
precisely to the chosen site of the brain with minimal damage to surrounding
<br>
tissue.
<br>
<p>Potential uses included the treatment of brain tumours, Parkinson's disease
<br>
(news - web sites), epilepsy and even new techniques of stem cell replacement
<br>
therapy.
<br>
<p>``PathFinder is the first robot with the intelligence to map-read a patient's
<br>
skull from a scanner image,'' said Patrick Finlay, managing director. ``It is
<br>
designed to provide the neurosurgeon with a precision positioning device which
<br>
is safe and simple to use in increasingly complex procedures.''
<br>
<p>In a news release, the firm explained that the surgeon instructs the robot by
<br>
making a target and an approach path on the patient's scan. The robot carries
<br>
a camera that automatically matches the scanner image to the position of the
<br>
patient's head on the operating table. The surgeon makes a tiny hole at the
<br>
entry point in the skull, and the robot then gently advances an instrument
<br>
through the hole to the chosen target.
<br>
<p>Armstrong said that the robot was about to start a programme of clinical
<br>
trials at Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham. Following extensive testing and
<br>
regulatory approval, it would shortly be used on patients.
<br>
<p>Paul Byrnes, consultant neurosugeon at Queen's Medical Centre said, ``This
<br>
development is a step forward in surgery, and should make difficult operations
<br>
easier to bear. It should improve the prospects of treatment for certain
<br>
categories of patients, and I am looking forward to evaluating it.''

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
