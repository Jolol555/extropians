</em><br>
<p>I also back an undertaking of this nature but also have the same fears you
<br>
have that the war will not be carried out in an efficient manner.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Earth's survival will be directly

</em><br>
<p>I can't see that Earth's survival is directly threatened by the terrorist
<br>
groups. Rather, Earth's existence is threatened by the reaction of far more
<br>
powerful groups of people to the activities of the terrorist groups.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If the US government were to go the way of Nazi Germany, then I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US
</em><br>
<p>If the US goes the way of Nazi Germany, there may not be any foreign
<br>
government strong enough to take it on.  Given that government power is
<br>
greatly increased during periods of war, I see our own government as a
<br>
greater threat than all the terrorist groups of the world.
<br>
<p>I'm probably going to get as much flak for saying this as Robert caught for
<br>
bringing up genocide, but I think it would be wise to look at the situation
<br>
objectively and to coldly calculate the odds of suffering harm from various
<br>
sources.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; even at the cost of civilian lives, even including my own.
</em><br>
<p>This reminds me of the topic of ideas worth dying for. There is no idea for
<br>
which I would trade a 100% risk of death; but there are goals for which I
<br>
would take risks of death. This is true for all of us, whether we
<br>
consciously acknowledge it or not. Every time we sit in a moving car we're
<br>
taking on a material risk of death.
<br>
<p>With respect to the current situation in the middle east, I would probably
<br>
not be willing to risk my life to go into the mountains of Afghanistan to
<br>
try to kill members of the Taliban or bin Laden and his helpers. I *would*
<br>
probably be willing to go into the area with the goal of helping women fight
<br>
Islamic suppression. Possibly it would turn out that the best way to
<br>
accomplish the latter would be to participate in the former, but I think
<br>
probably not. I could probably accomplish more by spreading ideas to
<br>
thousands than by killing a couple of people. (This is not automatically
<br>
true. It would depend on whom I killed and what the circumstances were. )
