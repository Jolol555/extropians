<em>&gt;&gt; Now, I think that there *is* an implication in that sentence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Mexicans are poorer than business executives, and are poorer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; than some other ethnic groups.  But Olga---this is a fact!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not a fact.  This is sloppy logic.  If you were working on an AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; database and wanted to code the logical &quot;fact&quot; that &quot;Mexicans are poorer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than business executives&quot;, I would object most vigorously.  This &quot;fact&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would break a lot of the logical relationships of other &quot;facts&quot; and would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably poison the whole project.
</em><br>
<p>You are perfectly correct:  those words that I quoted when taken
<br>
out of context are erroneous, and no AI should be administered such.
<br>
There are actually very few statements that are impossible to 
<br>
criticize (Eternal Truth #2: Every statement needs to be further
<br>
modified.)  Natasha's original remark specifically talked about
<br>
Los Angeles and indirectly alluded to the fact of recent immigration,
<br>
housing problems, and so on.  But what was important here was not
<br>
whether the particular item in question was indeed true:  what was
<br>
important is that the nature of the &quot;allegation&quot;, i.e., Mexicans
<br>
in L.A. could be expected to have fewer resources on average than
<br>
business executives (who have expense budgets, for one thing),
<br>
especially if it came to purchasing a gadget that has immediate
<br>
and valuable business applications, and relatively fewer social
<br>
ones.
<br>
<p>It was, and is, ridiculous to attack the notion that in this case
<br>
anything was wrong with the original statement implying that [in
<br>
Los Angeles] Mexicans [statistically] are poorer than business
<br>
executives [in the arena of being able to afford cellular phones].
<br>
I didn't think that you would need to have such qualifiers spelled
<br>
out.  They were obviously there in the context of the remark.
<br>
Unless you just wanted to attack something.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It implies that &quot;all&quot; Mexicans are poorer than &quot;all&quot; business executives,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is untrue.  It implies that the groups of Mexicans and business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; executives are mutually exclusive which is not true.  It implies that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mexicans cannot be rich like business executives, which is not true.
</em><br>
<p>All of these things are so.  But right now, humans are different than
<br>
AIs in the sense of not making such ridiculous blanket generalities.
<br>
As I said, it is impossible in most cases to so completely qualify
<br>
all the words of a sentence to the point that someone cannot infer
<br>
a faulty generalization such as these.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is the exact reason that statistical numbers for a whole group cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be applied to any individual.  It is one of the more common logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fallacies.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, quite right.  But I almost never get a chance (fortunately?) to
<br>
talk with people who improperly impute statistical characteristics
<br>
to individuals.
