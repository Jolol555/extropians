Researchers Find Enzyme Crucial to Preservation of Memories
<br>
<p>September 21, 2001— Using a technique to eliminate the function of one enzyme
<br>
in a restricted memory-related region in the brains of mice, researchers have
<br>
shown that the enzyme is important in consolidating long-term memories.
<br>
<p>According to the researchers, their experiments — which showed that defects in
<br>
a key biochemical signaling pathway were responsible for the animals’
<br>
inability
<br>
to improve their long-term memory in a series of maze tests — constitute a
<br>
powerful approach to understanding molecules involved in learning and memory.
<br>
<p>In an article published in the September 21, 2001, issue of Cell, Howard
<br>
Hughes
<br>
Medical Institute investigator Susumu Tonegawa and colleagues at the
<br>
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Vollum Institute reported that
<br>
elimination of the enzyme, calcium-calmodulin dependent kinase (CaMKIV), in
<br>
the
<br>
forebrains of mice had profound effects on signaling pathways in the brain and
<br>
learning behavior.
<br>
<p>The scientists began their studies to clarify the enzyme’s role in late
<br>
long-term potentiation (L-LTP), the process by which enduring memories are
<br>
established through a mechanism of activating genes that trigger protein
<br>
synthesis. This protein synthesis, in turn, alters the synapses — connections
<br>
between neurons — and “etches” permanent memory pathways.
<br>
<p>“CaMKIV had been implicated in long-term memory pathways in the past, but
<br>
previous studies had involved global knockout of the enzyme in the entire
<br>
animal,” said Tonegawa. “Such knockouts gave inconsistent results because they
<br>
affected the whole brain throughout development. We decided to use a technique
<br>
to inhibit the protein only in the forebrain, which is more involved in higher
<br>
brain function.”
<br>
<p>Tonegawa said that other research groups had attempted to knock out a protein
<br>
called CREB, which is involved in turning on gene transcription in L-LTP, and
<br>
which was believed to be activated by CaMKIV. The results of these studies
<br>
were
<br>
inconclusive, Tonegawa said, because there appeared to be multiple forms of
<br>
CREB that could compensate for any knockout.
<br>
<p>Tonegawa and his colleagues used a genetic technique that allowed them to
<br>
replace the normal CaMKIV with a “dominant negative” mutant enzyme that would
<br>
be produced only in the forebrains of the mice. Dominant negative enzymes have
<br>
all of the characteristics of the functioning enzyme — such as an ability to
<br>
bind normally to other molecules — but they lack the ability to carry out an
<br>
appropriate enzymatic reaction.
<br>
<p>The scientists first studied the molecular details of the lack of CaMKIV
<br>
activity in brain slices from the transgenic mice. They discovered that the
<br>
base level of CaMKIV activity in the mouse brains was normal, but when
<br>
chemicals were added that mimicked the conditions of neuronal activity, as in
<br>
memory formation, the enzyme function was significantly lower. The brain slice
<br>
studies also revealed that CREB activation by phosphorylation in the
<br>
transgenic
<br>
mice was suppressed, strongly implicating a role for the CaMKIV in normal CREB
<br>
activation as a result of neuronal activity.
<br>
<p>Experiments with brain slices also revealed that the transmission of nerve
<br>
impulses in the transgenic mice was normal, except under conditions mimicking
<br>
protein-synthesis-dependent L-LTP.
<br>
<p>“These results pinpointed for us the role of CaMKIV in the
<br>
protein-synthesis-dependent type of LTP,” emphasized Tonegawa. “This is very
<br>
important, because in the past people have published studies implicating
<br>
another enzyme, called protein kinase A, in LTP. However, that enzyme was not
<br>
specific to the protein-synthesis-dependent type of LTP.”
<br>
<p>With clear physiological evidence that they had specifically disrupted the
<br>
CaMKIV pathway, the researchers next tested how well the transgenic mice could
<br>
consolidate memories of a water maze. The mice were placed in a pool of water
<br>
made opaque by floating beads, and required to find a platform submerged just
<br>
beneath the surface. The transgenic mice initially learned the task as well as
<br>
normal mice, but as training continued, they became significantly less able to
<br>
find the platform.
<br>
<p>“Thus, while these mice have a normal ability to acquire memories, they have
<br>
problems converting those memories into a long-term form,” said Tonegawa.
<br>
However, he noted, maze experiments still present problems in interpretation.
<br>
“This training takes place over a two-week period, so the memory acquisition
<br>
and consolidation processes are superimposed,” said Tonegawa. “Thus, it is
<br>
difficult to know whether the deficit is primarily in the acquisition phase or
<br>
the consolidation phase.”
<br>
<p>In an additional set of experiments, the scientists compared normal and
<br>
transgenic animals’ ability to acquire and consolidate the memory that
<br>
involves
<br>
associating a mild shock to the footpads to the specific context of the
<br>
chamber
<br>
in which the shock is administered. In these experiments, memory acquisition
<br>
could be more clearly separated from memory consolidation, said Tonegawa.
<br>
These
<br>
experiments demonstrated that the CaMKIV-deficient mice could learn to
<br>
associate the shocks to the chamber context, but they had difficulties in
<br>
converting such memories to long lasting memories, said Tonegawa.
<br>
<p>“Our conclusion from these tests was that the CaMKIV pathway was primarily
<br>
involved in memory consolidation and retention,” he said.
<br>
<p>Tonegawa noted that memory consolidation in the transgenic animals was not
<br>
completely extinguished, suggesting that there may be parallel signaling
<br>
pathways involved in consolidation, or that there may have been incomplete
<br>
knockout of CaMKIV activity.
<br>
<p>“However, we believe that further studies using this technique will allow us
<br>
to
<br>
dissect in greater detail the differential roles and interactions of these
<br>
signal transduction pathways, and how they contribute to this very complex
<br>
mechanism of memory consolidation,” he said. “Also, we want to know which
<br>
genes
<br>
are activated in this process and how these gene products helps establish
<br>
these
<br>
long-term changes in synaptic strengths.”
