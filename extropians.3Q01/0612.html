Is the placebo effect a &quot;psychic effect&quot; in itself? Isn't it &quot;mind over
<br>
matter&quot;, ie PK? The truth is out there.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people who report a religious affiliation have lower rates of illness.

<em>&gt; &gt; Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have reported that attending

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I think is occuring is simply a sort of placebo effect: those who
</em><br>

</em><br>
