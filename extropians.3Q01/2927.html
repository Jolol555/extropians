</em><br>
<p>Speaking for myself, I don't see myself stewing in any juices. I see myself as liberated, most recently from a twit who
<br>
felt obligated to re- and re-post an article which was in questionable taste the first time.
<br>
<p>I'm not calling him, or the original author, racist. I'm calling him a twit, and that's milder than what he apparently
<br>
called me. :)
<br>
<p>Attention is the most limited resource.

<p>PS: &quot;plonk&quot; is a familiar sound in outhouses, too. :)
