</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; None of the versions of hardware you mention actually exists. The &quot;runtime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system&quot; you imagine would need to exceed the capacity of all extant hardware,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and if the intelligence necessary to do this does not exceed human-level, we'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have one _now_.
</em><br>
<p>Get real. We cannot build an orbital tower made of carbon nanotubes at
<br>
present, but that does not imply that the intelligence needed to create
<br>
this hard engineering feat is beyond current human intelligence - the
<br>
problem is simply a lack of certain material technologies.  The fact
<br>
that the hardware to run an upload is extreme does not imply that you
<br>
need superintelligence to build it. The same could just as well be said
<br>
for the pentium processor.
<br>
<p>I think you do not understand what computational neuroscientists are
<br>
doing right now. The hard part of the above scheme is not the runtime
<br>
system, we have the essentials in the form of compartment simulations
<br>
and chemical models already - they can in principle be scaled up, and do
<br>
not contain any smarts except solving a lot of coupled differential
<br>
equations numerically. Understanding the brain enough to create this
<br>
kind of model does not require superintelligence, just a lot of
<br>
dilligent research to dig up data like ionic conductances and time
<br>
constants of all ion channels of a particular type of neuron.
<br>
Intelligence helps, but it is the collective intelligence of the
<br>
neuroscientific community rather than any part of the uploading system
<br>
per se. The pattern-recognition system is the part that would require
<br>
the most smarts, since it needs to be able to determine the 3D
<br>
morphology of membranes and convert that into a compartment model. But
<br>
there are already software doing something like this, and this is likely
<br>
an area where a brute force approch could work. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It doesn't help to underestimate the difficulty of building hardware, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sympathize with your exuberant optimism, it's just that I think it makes more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense to build a UIM than to dream about uploading without one.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, build one and I will believe you. But your own criticism of
<br>
uploading applies to UIMs too, and since you most likely clearly see why
<br>
it is wrong in that case, I hope you can extend the analogy to uploading
<br>
too.
