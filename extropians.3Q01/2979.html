<p><em>&gt; I hate to sound stupid, but what's a diff?
</em><br>
<p>Hey, I've come to accept that most people on this list are complete
<br>
computer illiterates.
<br>
<p>The &quot;diff&quot; program is part of the basic Unix textprocessing toolchest.
<br>
It compares two text files and outputs a description of their
<br>
differences, a &quot;delta&quot; or in this context a &quot;diff&quot;.  There is also
<br>
a corresponding &quot;patch&quot;[1] program that can take a diff and merge those
<br>
changes into a file.
<br>
<p>Diffs are interesting in that they are both data files intended for
<br>
processing by a program, as well as text intended for human
<br>
consumption.  People can look at the diff and evaluate the changes
<br>
before applying them.  The exchange of diffs is central to Open
<br>
Source software development.  As an OpenBSD developer, I send and
<br>
receive diffs all the time.
<br>
<p><p>[1] While &quot;diff&quot; has been around forever, &quot;patch&quot; was later written
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Larry Wall, who is widely known as the creator of the Perl
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;language. &quot;patch&quot; is arguably a much greater contribution, since
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it became a core infrastructure component that enabled distributed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collaborative software development over the early net.
