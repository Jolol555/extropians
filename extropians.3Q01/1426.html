<p>Doh!  I spoke too soon.  Turns out the ground radar failed, so in an
<br>
actual attack (on Seattle of course) it would have ordered a second
<br>
missile to be fired, wasting millions of dollars, even tho the first one
<br>
<p>had already saved the fair city on the Pacific.  I noticed the LA Times
<br>
was true to form in reporting the name of the company that screwed
<br>
the pooch, even tho the company name did not appear when they
<br>
thought the test successful.  {8-[   Fortunately it was Raaaaytheon.

<p>CRUCIAL RADAR FAILED MISSILE DEFENSE TEST: Although
<br>
initially called a success, the system's trial run on Saturday had a
<br>
troubling glitch,
<br>
some analysts say. Despite initial assessments that Saturday's test was
<br>
a
<br>
success, the Pentagon acknowledged that a prototype radar was unable to
<br>
tell ground controllers whether a kill vehicle had destroyed its target.
<br>
The
<br>
radar, a critical element of the controversial national antimissile
<br>
system,
<br>
falsely reported that the interceptor had missed the dummy warhead.
<br>
Independently, several sensors set up to monitor the test showed a hit.
<br>
<p>The Pentagon confirmed the radar problem but downplayed the incident
<br>
as a programming glitch. Analysts were troubled by the radar's failure
<br>
to
<br>
make the so-called hit assessment. In addition to identifying real
<br>
warheads
<br>
from decoys, the $100-million prototype radar is supposed to help ground
<br>
<p>controllers determine whether they should launch backup interceptors if
<br>
the
<br>
first failed to hit their targets. The prototype radar is one-third the
<br>
size of a
<br>
production model that is under development by Ra[aaaa]ytheon Corp. In
<br>
Saturday's test, Pentagon officials contend the radar was too sensitive
<br>
and
<br>
tried to track all the debris, overwhelming the computer processing the
<br>
data.
<br>
<p>But Ra[aaaaaa]ytheon officials said the radar's computer was overloaded
<br>
with information just seconds before the intercept causing it to lapse
<br>
into a
<br>
&quot;coast&quot; mode. When the intercept did occur, it was not able to relay the
<br>
<p>information instantly. (Los Angeles Times)
