</em><br>
<p>You need to be much more rigorous in your thinking.
<br>
If one agrees that an &quot;omnipotent, omniscient&quot; 'being' violates
<br>
known laws of physics, then it isn't even worth discussing (while
<br>
we are at our current level of development).  What one wants to
<br>
discuss are *what* are the capabilities and capacities of a
<br>
full nanotech-enabled superintelligence relative to our level
<br>
of civilization such that they could appear to be quasi-omnipotent
<br>
or quasi-omniscient such that they could interfere with our
<br>
affairs undetectably at a high frequency.
<br>
<p>Then Brian Atkins wrote:
<br>

</em><br>
<p>I'll one-trump Brian's comments by pointing out some unpublished
<br>
arguments by Robert Freitas (that ignore Bayesian probabilities
<br>
regarding ancestor sims) suggest that with we are living in
<br>
a simulation at a higher than 99.9999% probability.
<br>
<p>While these arguments are open to debate (because the sims
<br>
could be arranged to suggest that the physical computational
<br>
capacity of the 'simed' universe is actually greater or less than
<br>
that that is really available) it raises the point that must
<br>
be considered that if the real universe has sim capacity &gt;=
<br>
the capacity of our perceived universe, then the probability
<br>
that this reality is a sim has to merit serious consideration.
