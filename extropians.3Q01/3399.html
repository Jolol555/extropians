<em>&gt; &gt; In the attempt to correct past and current issues

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; otherwise well meaning individuals have created new

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You know... this one has always bugged me.  I used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a white male.
</em><br>
<p>You used to be one? Is there a surgical procedure you can get to be
<br>
not-white?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was married to a phillipino female.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; She was the major bread winner, I worked part time at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimum wage jobs and took care of the house and kids.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When the kids were all in school I went back to school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and got an AA in computer info systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I went to work for the same company (different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; office)as my spouse, doing the same job she'd been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing for 5 years(Network Admin) at a higher pay (with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no experience.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2 years later I was promoted over her to a regional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a white male I heard about reverse discrimination,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I never experienced it.  I heard about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; institutionalization of discrimination against white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; males, but it had zero impact on my life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead, I enjoyed white male privilege... in every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social, school and work setting, I was automatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accorded more respect than women or ethnic minorities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (even by the minorities themselves) simply because I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a white male.
</em><br>
<p>Gee, Loree, I don't know your wife at all, so I can't make any
<br>
pronouncements, but do you think possibly it may be because you are a
<br>
better thinker/worker than she was in the job? How did your and her
<br>
evaluations compare?
<br>
<p>Did you notice any changes when you became not a white male?
