<em>&gt; _Quadrant_ has just accepted my latest rejoinder to Margaret
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Somerville in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; record time. It'll be published in the August issue. Aussies on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the list can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get it in their local newsagency or read it in the local public library.
</em><br>
<p>Well, congratulations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, this good news came to me the same day that the American lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; house of Congress passed this ridiculous and draconian legislation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems the world's greatest liberal deomcracy is intent on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turning into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theocracy. There goes the global neighbourhood.
</em><br>
<p>Been coming for a while. When I first came over to the US from the UK, first
<br>
thing I noticed (aside from 8 people being shot dead in unrelated incidents
<br>
the weekend of my arrival in Houston) was how rabid people are about
<br>
religion and denomination. Utterly rabid. I don't notice it so much after
<br>
five years, but still, compared to the UK, it's a real eye-opener.
<br>
<p>(Then I started to notice what an English accent does to Texans, after which
<br>
I stopped paying attention to other things. I swear, it's like clubbing baby
<br>
seals, only you can't stop).
<br>
<p>The theocratization of the US can be seen as an illustration of why
<br>
non-repressive societies become repressive societies: give people freedom,
<br>
and that includes the group which wants to use that freedom to set up a
<br>
repressive society. How do you defend against that without becoming a
<br>
repressive society? You don't. It's the paradox of libertarianism and
<br>
anarchism -- neither can really exist in practice. To defend a libertarian
<br>
or anarchist society from determined people and organizations who want to
<br>
bring about another form of society/govenment requires that the libertarian
<br>
or anarchist society organise and become non-libertarian/non-anarchist.
<br>
