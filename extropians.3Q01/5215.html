<em>&gt; &gt; I tend to agree with you on this. Of course the first successful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrorist attack with a weapon of mass destruction will probably be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it's last since undoubtably the retaliation will mean complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; elimination of said group.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't care about the group (assuming, they're nice enough to advertize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their name and their location), and the group doesn't care about being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational, otherwise it wouldn't do something as foolish. I care about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people nuked.
</em><br>
<p>This shows a distinct lack of understanding of the phenomenon of
<br>
terrorism. Terrorism is not irrational, and terrorists are not
<br>
irrational people. They do what they do for very specific reasons and
<br>
with very specific goals. They tend to be highly educated. Their reasons
<br>
and goals may seem irrational to you and me, but within their own
<br>
meme-plex, they are entirely rational.
<br>
<p>It is also important to distinguish between those who
<br>
organize/propagandize and those who execute acts. Someone like Osama bin
<br>
Laden, for example, will never himself drive a suicide carbomb into a
<br>
hotel, but he sees nothing wrong with convincing others with Koran
<br>
derived propaganda to martyr themselves in the service of his goals.
<br>
Muammar Khadafi likewise will never offer himself up to martyrdom, but
<br>
will celebrate those that give their lives in service to him.
<br>
<p>If someone like Khadafi or bin Laden has a nuke, they are never going to
<br>
use it in an act that risks themselves getting nuked in retaliation, and
<br>
they know such retaliation will come, because it is considered, by 50
<br>
years of MAD, to be a moral and rational response to someone who
<br>
initiates the use of nuclear weapons in war. 
<br>
<p>The reason why terrorists do what they do without fear of retaliation is
<br>
because they do not fear their home sanctuaries being blamed en masse
<br>
for their minor actions of shooting and carbombing small groups of
<br>
people. If they use a nuke, however, it is acknowledged that the
<br>
logistical base required for such a mission can only implicated large
<br>
numbers of people, thus conferring group guilt on the inhabitants of the
<br>
terrorists places of sanctuary.
<br>
<p>You will notice that the west doesn't care much about Israel targeting
<br>
individual Palestinians who are involved in terrorism, but does get mad
<br>
about Israelis killing anonymous Palestinians in general. This is the
<br>
difference between individual and collective guilt, but only because the
<br>
actions taken are rather minor. It is rather well understood by the
<br>
terrorist world that major attacks on US soil will generally unleash the
<br>
floodgates against whoever initiates it. They therefore tread a thin
<br>
line in their actions, striking blows with minor attacks, but never
<br>
enough to really attract significant column-inch space or prime time
<br>
coverage to the ferocity of the attack, but just enough to attract some
<br>
attention to the causes espoused by the terrorists. Thus, use of high
<br>
impact weapons like nukes are entirely anathema to the tactics and
<br>
strategies of terrorist groups.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Terrorists no, rogue nations yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I'm not willing the take the risk rogue nations are that stupid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Besides, I'm not sure it makes sense to differentiate rogue nations from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists, because a dictator has far too much to lose than an anonymous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group that is not in control.
</em><br>
<p>Another misconception: in a terrorist situation, the terrorist has
<br>
control, while they displace responsibility onto those they attack for
<br>
'making them do what they are doing'. You are right that a dictator has
<br>
far more to lose, but only because he has a well defined, fixed base of
<br>
operations. Dictators use similar displacement as rationalization for
<br>
their tyranny. They always are doing what they are doing 'because they
<br>
were forced to' by 'circustances out of their control'....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have stated a number of times that the system we were discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was not designed for either superpowers nor terrorists, but rogue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very well, I've stated a number of times that the umbrella will cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other superpowers to increase their arsenal, and modify that arsenal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resulting in more more difficult to intercept nukes. This is not a neutral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side effect, and needs to be taken into the calculation. Even if you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not directly protecting yourself against other superpowers.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, they will, and the cost of doing so will raise the barrier to entry
<br>
for 'superpower status'. The current barrier has been dropping as
<br>
ballistic missile technology has been dropping in price over the last
<br>
decade or so. ABM technology helps raise the price back to where it once
<br>
was. Those that cannot afford the higher price can no longer play the
<br>
game.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Again the system is not designed to thwart terrorists, except those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that head a rogue nation. Whether or not we successfully identify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the terrorists in you theoretical attack would remain to be seen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I very much hope that my attack will remain theoretical. And you seem not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to understand that you're thinking rationally, but no rational person will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuke you. These is not the folks you have to be wary of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You couldn't even begin to successfully alert a population in 18
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; minutes, much less get them to move anywhere unless they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; completely prepared.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Technically, in the year 2001 you can alert the entire population in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seconds, on a rather modest budget. For starters, a cellphone with added
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functionality and NEMP/jam detector will do. Training is another issue,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which, I believe, I already mentioned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;So, how many shelters can you build for 300 gigabucks, or so?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not enough by far.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, that's what goobvarmint is for, to create regulations that every new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built house needs to have a shelter of an approved design. These are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incremental costs, and as a side effect you get shelters with very short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average distances, so that you can react within a few minutes forewarning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There you go, your attack by your terrorists, using your scenario
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; isn't even worth building a defense against.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Um, you have a singularly selective perception.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My mistake, when I think of ICBM I think fusion not fission, so we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't even need to build bunkers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Small portable devices will be weak, dirty fission, maybe boosted fission.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; State of the art nuclear devices should not be on the free market. Rogue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states don't do fusion, for the same reason they don't do ICBMs. Good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physicists and technicians are a lot scarcer and much less expendable than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fanatics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A smart terrorist would place his bomb in the largest shelter he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could find.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since shelters are distributed (well, they have be, because otherwise the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean average distance would be too long), and he would have to detonate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his weak nuke underground, the amounts of survivors would be maximum in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this case. If you have limited resources, you go for an airburst, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will profit from the nuke being dirty, if not salted. Much nastier than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high flux, which they won't get, anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But this is again besides the point, the system we were discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was to defend against a limited number of rogue state launched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ICBM's not a terrorist attack. This does not make it useless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you say so.
