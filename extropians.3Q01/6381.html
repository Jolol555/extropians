<em>&gt;From: Miriam English &lt;<a href="mailto:miriam@werple.net.au?Subject=Re:%20Inpact%20on%20History&In-Reply-To=&lt;200109131933.MAA17554@well.com&gt;">miriam@werple.net.au</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;And if your violent solution basically guarantees the future of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorism? Like trying to stop insects by flooding the place with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;DDT. It may work temporarily, but they bounce back with renewed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vigour and this time all the birds that previously controlled them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are gone.
</em><br>
<p>Nice try at a metaphor.
<br>
<p>If you kill all the &quot;insects&quot; they don't bounce back.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;At this point you are sounding just like one of the suicide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pilots. I am not trying to insult you, I am just wanting you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;look at what you are saying. Please step back for a moment and see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what the repercussions are two or three moves later.
</em><br>
<p>I am the furthest thing from those dead assholes, and as an avid
<br>
chess player I'm used to looking at least three moves ahead.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Eliminating terrorism is a laudable aim. The best idea on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that I have read so far is of forming a think-tank on using very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unconventional means to reach that end. Weapons won't do it. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Education almost certainly will. The trick is how do you get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information to  areas such as those? How do you lift people out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such poverty that a fantasy of fucking 72 virgins forever looks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like a good option instead of the mind-warp that it is? My
</em><br>
<em>&gt;next-door neighbors are islamic. Very nice folk... ummm except for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the mother... she won't allow the kids to read any of the books I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;give them. The father seems a nice enough guy, but the mother is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;full-on. The kids are totally charming.
</em><br>
<p>This is two seperate goals here.
<br>
<p>As to the second, how do you change peoples minds without
<br>
interfering in their culture? Get back to me on that.
<br>
<p>Now the first part.
<br>
<p>Thousands of innocent Americans have been murdered by terrorists.
<br>
This is an act of War. The people who did this will be found, and
<br>
pay for their sneak attack with their lives.
<br>
<p>Hopefully as part of this, the international community will band
<br>
together and take serious action to eliminate world terrorism, so
<br>
accomplishing the first part may help accomplish the second goal.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If the US lifted all sanctions tomorrow and showered the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fundamentalist extremist states with food, knowledge, luxuries,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and wealth, without pushing the American culture, the extremists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be screwed and the violence would end -- not instantly, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it would end.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;It won't happen though. People love hatred too much.
</em><br>
<p>If they want the &quot;good things in life&quot; they will have to earn them,
<br>
same as we did.
