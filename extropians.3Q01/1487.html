<em>&gt;What have you been asked lately?
</em><br>
<p>Since returning home from Extro-5 I have been asked by friends and family about what I learned at the conference regarding cryonics! lol  They all had falsely assumed ExI was a cryonics organization.  I have had to repeatedly explain to them that it is not.
<br>
<p>Generally, I mention this list or the conference very casually and then I get asked what the &quot;extropians&quot; are about.  I explain it is a group of generally ordinary people from all over the world who online and in conferences discuss how advancing technologies like nanotech(usually I have to stop and very briefly explain nano), A.I., and biotech can positively transform our world.  Sometimes I also bring up the singularity if I think the person can handle it.  
<br>
<p>The response I usually get is, &quot;cool, yes, I also think these technologies will really change things!&quot;  I have even given out the ExI URL on occasion and explained about the mailing list.  I did this with a philosophy professor at my local college, but I don't know if he has acted on it yet.
<br>
<p>I find sharing about ExI and transhumanism is MUCH easier then bringing up cryonics.  And with extropianism first introduced, I can later on bring up cryonics as an extreme life-extension measure some transhumanists decide to use.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
