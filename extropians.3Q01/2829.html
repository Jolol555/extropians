<em>&gt;From: &quot;Lee Corbin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=RE:%20Fred%20Reed%20-%20The%20Dave%20Barry%20of%20Racists&In-Reply-To=&lt;F199KoMFYsDSzhxRz3s0000dae6@hotmail.com&gt;">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I claim that Emlyn and Olga have accused the &quot;essay&quot; by Fred Reed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as being racist, and have posted questioning remarks about both it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and J.R. Molloy who unleashed it on this list.  I would appreciate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know what is seen as the worst of its racist claims, innuendos,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or remarks, so that something concrete could be focused upon, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we might perhaps all come to a consensus about.  (My own recall of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is a little vague, right now.)
</em><br>
<p>OK, I suppose you expect me to try to pull out a sentence in that &quot;essay&quot; 
<br>
which is either false or unduly disparaging of blacks.  Well I grant you the 
<br>
post didn't contain anything on the order of: &quot;All niggers are shiftless, 
<br>
lazy, criminals who have made no worthwhile contribution to society&quot; or &quot;The 
<br>
only good nigger is a dead nigger.&quot;
<br>
<p>But, how about this:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;People in, say, Switzerland can walk their streets after dark. We can't. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What have we got that they don't, that might cause fear?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Elvis impersonators, Johnny. Yep. Switzerland doesn't have any Elvis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impersonators. Check for yourself.
</em><br>
<p>The clear implication (granted while made with tongue in cheek) is that the 
<br>
Swiss are safe after dark because, unlike we woeful Americans, they don't 
<br>
have blacks to deal with.  The unspoken suggestion is that if we were to 
<br>
ship all the blacks back to Africa the good white folks of this great 
<br>
country could take all the locks off their doors and live in peace and 
<br>
safety.
<br>
<p>With that, please accept my exit from this thread.  It no longer has 
<br>
anything of value to offer.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>Life is good.  Refuse to die.
