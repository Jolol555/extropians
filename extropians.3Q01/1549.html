<em>&gt; THis one has got me pretty freaked.  The DMCA is broken

</em><br>
<p>The foreign national was in fact, in US territory when he was nabbed. I
<br>
do not know if he was employed by a US company or not, but if he has
<br>
violated US copyrights in the past, he can be detained when and if he
<br>
enters US jurisdictions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  We grab them out of a conference and haul
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them off to a foreign federal prison with no apparent access to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family, embassy or decent representation.  In a couple of weeks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the victim will reappear in SF so the court can decide whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he should have a public defender ?!
</em><br>
<p>At which point, as is standard under diplomatic treaty, he can have a
<br>
Russian consular official present, who can participate in his defense if
<br>
he has not hired a lawyer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it just me or is this utter contemptible behavior on the part
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; country that happens to have laws on its books I never had a say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in or agreed to in any way if I should attend any event in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country?
</em><br>
<p>If you violate the laws of that country, and willfully place your body
<br>
under their jurisdiction by traveling there, the consequences are
<br>
obviously one that is deserved for individuals who act so stupidly. As
<br>
for being in your own country, stop being so silly and grow up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Has it come to the point that laws can be declared and people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prosecuted without regard for nationality or what nation passed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the laws and with no guarantees at all of reasonable process or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; room to address the merits of the case?
</em><br>
<p>Being arrested has nothing to do with process or addressing the merits
<br>
of the case. Grow up. First he needs to be arraigned in the federal
<br>
court that has jurisdiction, i.e. the 9th district, since that is the
<br>
district in which the copyright holders whose works were violated are
<br>
located. Right now he is in transit from the location he was arrested to
<br>
the location he is being sent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What can be done to stop this madness?  No one is safe if this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is what the world has come to, and especially not if this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the US has come to.
</em><br>
<p>Its been that way for quite a while, Samantha. We gun owners have been
<br>
living under this sort of crap since 1934, in a far more severe manner,
<br>
than computer weenies have in the last 10 years. Gun law violators, if
<br>
they are not shot in SWAT raids, typically suffer from circumstances of
<br>
warrant secrecy, evidence suppression, and overwhelming government legal
<br>
investment to convict them, in which case, whether or not an actual
<br>
violent act was committed, any gun violation is treated as a violent
<br>
felony. If they are lucky enough to be found innocent or have their
<br>
cases dismissed due to the gestapo tactics of the government, their
<br>
lives are typically entirely ruined, and their property destroyed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - a smaller matter---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Adobe is also now on my boycott list.  Does anyone know of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good PDF reader on Windoze?  I don't want to see their company
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logo for a good long while on any machine I am on.  On Gnu/Linux
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I use xpdf.  But it seems a bit of overkill to run an X server
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on windoze just to view pdf files at work.
</em><br>
<p>GhostScript and GhostViewer. They are open source and available for
<br>
windows.
