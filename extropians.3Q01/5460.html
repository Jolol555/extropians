<em>&gt; You are accusing me of using circular reasoning.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  Circular reasoning means presuming what you claim to prove.
<br>
The fallacy of the stolen concept does not mean circular reasoning, but
<br>
making a conclusion that conflicts with a premise -- typically an implicit
<br>
premise.  Another way of putting it: assuming what you explicitly deny or
<br>
denying something that your denial logically depends on.  See Nathaniel
<br>
Branden's &quot;The Stolen Concept&quot; at

<p><em>&gt; Not once did I ever say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;nothing&quot; is true. Granted, if I said nothing was true but intended that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very statement itself to be true, as if it is true there are no truths,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed I would have spoken a contradiction. I did not say that. I did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not imply that. You are reading your own stuff into what I said.
</em><br>
<p>Let's move on to your next substantive passage to see.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I just do not believe it is the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth all the time or in all situations. Truth is relative. Realism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an attempt to say at least some truths are not relative. If a person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; takes the time to strictly specify context, and if a person gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repeated example within that same context, I admit things should not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change. But as I have said already, people assume consistent context
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when in fact such is not always the case. This is an error in logic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Realism is the logical fallacy of universal context, when in fact there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no such thing.
</em><br>
<p>Is this claim of yours that &quot;Truth is relative&quot; true all the time and in all
<br>
contexts, or just some of the time or in some contexts?  If the former, then
<br>
aren't you making a universal claim and claiming to know a universal truth?
<br>
If the latter, which contexts?  If the latter, this then leads me to believe
<br>
there is at least one universal truth -- that is that &quot;Truth is relative&quot;
<br>
does not apply in all contexts at all times.
<br>
<p>I do not disagree that context is important, but you are making universal
<br>
claims and violating your own dictum above.  It would be better not to make
<br>
such statements on focus instead on what particular claims or beliefs you
<br>
find to be overgeneralizations or taken out of context.
<br>
<p>Also, it doesn't matter in this context what realism says or doesn't say.
<br>
You might be attacking it, btu your attack fails.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again you have failed to justify your criticism of what I said.
</em><br>
<p>See above.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
