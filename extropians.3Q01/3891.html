Lycos really ticks me off sometimes.  My post yesterday on this subject never made it!  Anyway, I like the simple statements from Natasha's essay of several years ago.
<br>
<p>Natasha wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt;Hans Moravec scars the pants off me when I talk with &gt;him about becoming a bush -:)
</em><br>
<p>Watch out for those hungry nano-caterpillars!  I'm sure there will be a defense for them though, so don't be scurred! ;)  I learn all sorts of terms watching MTV.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Today, we refer to transhuman as meaning an &gt;evolutionary transition from being biologically human &gt;toward our merger with technology, as set forth by FM.
</em><br>
<p>I do see how the concept has evolved further from what F.M. originally envisioned.  Still, so much can be learned from his writings.  F.M. has both an enthusiasm and sense of compassion which I marvel at as I read him. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Transhumanism as defined by Max More explains the &gt;overcoming of human limits and the transformation &gt;from being human to becoming posthuman. 
</em><br>
<p>I saw Star Trek; First Contact on video last night.  I could not help thinking of the villainous Borg as I  reread over this thread.  Such fictional characters are of course well-known to the public, and set forth a meme which says by literally merging with our technology a loss of identity and basically technological rape will occur.  
<br>
<p>This will be a meme which will be a challenge for transhumanists to overcome.  I see journalists over the next half-century or more showing scenes of the Borg both to grab viewer attention and to imply we will be twisted by what is coming. 
<br>
<p>I realize Jennifer Alba in the tv show Dark Angel is much more positive and exciting as a fictional transhuman example!.  Again, I fall into the trap of envisioning a transhuman as a character from films life Matrix and X-Men!  For some time it will not be anywhere so dramatic.
<br>
<p>I think the development of the transhuman has over the past several decades crept up on mainstream America.  As has been said, taken for granted technologies like hip replacements and contact lenses are helping to take us there.  I do wonder if the first immune system boosting and/or cognitive enhancing nanobots will make it on the scene without to much social agitation.  They will allow people to really say, &quot;I am a transhuman.&quot;    
<br>
<p>I personally could see calling myself a transhumanist, but I would balk at saying I am transhuman at this point(even if I technically were)!  That could cause people to take a step back!  I have a friend who thought transhuman really was another term for transexual!! ;)  Of course, most people do not bring a junior highschool mentality into their adult years...         
<br>
<p>In my original post I brought up FM-2030 since he is a personal hero of mine, despite the fact I never had the honor of meeting him.  Just the other day I looked over his new memorial site and was very impressed at what I saw.
<br>
<p>I wish everyone would take the time to read his Upwinger manifesto.  I see it as a precursor to the transhumanism/extropianism of today.  
<br>
<p>OPTIMISM - ABUNDANCE - UNIVERSALISM - IMMORTALITY! 
<br>
<p>Not only read the essay but explore F.M.'s entire website memorial.
<br>

<br>
<p>The pictures which covered the course of his life were an education to me.  To see a man go from youthful strength, to middle-aged transition, and then older maturity and wisdom was very touching.  I look forward to one day meeting F.M. when he bounces back from his current situation. :)  
<br>
<p>I really look forward to his next book!  The one where he shares his reactions to being brought back into a world he had always dreamed about.  I hope what he finds will meet his expectations...  
<br>
<p>I believe FM's views are still very insightful and recommend everyone read the interview Natasha did with him.  He gives his thoughts on what we are currently discussing.

<br>
<p>I wish his books would become available again in some format.  My mother found a copy of _Are you a Transhuman?_ at a local used bookstore.  And later told me, &quot;I just somehow knew you would want it!&quot; :)
<br>
<p>best wishes to all,
<br>
<p>John
