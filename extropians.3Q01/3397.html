<em>&gt; &gt; I think your mixing issues here, slavery and its end is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; completely different issue then as you put it &quot;de jure segregation&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know what the issues are and how they are different.  I did not mention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything about reparations.  I was talking about bigotry, and how it neither
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ended with slavery nor magically go away &quot;7 generations&quot; ago.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but you are changing the subject. Virtually anyone who isn't of
<br>
british descent (and male) has ancestors who have been discriminated
<br>
against by bigotry (which may or may not be stronger between
<br>
discriminated groups). Bigotry is not what we are talking about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What about voluntary segregation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's your right to hang around with anyone you want.  But public schools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should not bar children of a certain color from attending.  And hospitals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouldn't have a policy of barring people of a certain color from receiving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatment.  And public pools should not be for &quot;whites only.&quot;  Etcetera.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but why is it then that minorities tend to prefer to group
<br>
together in areas where they will receive substandard services rather
<br>
than integrate in higher quality areas?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In the attempt to correct past and current issues about race,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; otherwise well meaning individuals have created new ones as any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; white male can tell you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There is current discrimination against white males, which we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not going to ignore as we address these issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hey, I've read Warren Farrell, myself.  Certain biases against men, women,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ugly people, short people, fat people, poor people (and on and on and on)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist, and those are all different subjects in their own right (but cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BEGIN to touch the subject of &quot;white on black&quot; racism that has existed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our country).  As to the &quot;any white male can tell you&quot; - all right, let's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start with the white alpha male currently residing in the White (no pun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intended) House - can he tell me the terrible trials and tribulations he's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone through on his road to recove...eh, I mean, on his road to the White
</em><br>
<em>&gt; House?  I wonder.  Wouldn't he qualify as an &quot;any&quot; male?  Any white male,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you say, huh?  (Get serious!)
</em><br>
<p>Bush doesnt' count, outside of the horrendous discrimination and bigotry
<br>
that liberals have exhibited against him because of his speech
<br>
impediment. I guess learning disabled people are only 'minorities' when
<br>
they vote democrat, huh?
<br>
<p>Rather, count, for instance, the middle and upper class black kids who
<br>
get free rides to colleges based on their race while poor white kids
<br>
just as capable are rejected specifically because they are white.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; One of the problems is that we have not agreed on what &quot;racism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Racist&quot; mean on this list. There are for example those who claim it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has only to do with genetics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It has to do with history, primarily.  &quot;Race&quot; is not a scientific reality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but a social enigma.
</em><br>
<p>While there is greater genetic difference between males and females than
<br>
between races, there are still quantifiable genetic differences between
<br>
races of the same gender. Forensics would not be a viable science if
<br>
this were not so.
