<p>Robert, you're forgetting that the very agencies that
<br>
keep such lists are really the greatest threats to
<br>
life and liberty.  It's a pact with the devil to
<br>
profoundly increase the power of the entity that
<br>
firebombed Dresden, carries out the War on Drugs,
<br>
drastically restricts medical improvements, and
<br>
is doing very disturbing things to IP on order to
<br>
stop the entity that destroyed the WTC.  
<br>
<p>This was indeed a horible event and we will act to
<br>
reduce chances of a repeat.  But you don't want a 
<br>
cure worse than the disease.
<br>
<p>I think people are overemphsizing the knives as 
<br>
the weapons.  A four-or-less inch knife isn't too
<br>
much of a weapon and the passengers and crew could
<br>
have overwhelmed the hijackers easily with at most
<br>
a few casualties and probably no deaths.  The real
<br>
weapon was the person.  I notice these were all 
<br>
lightly peopled flights, which I think was deliberate 
<br>
as with 150 on board the hijack would have failed.
<br>
<p>Parenthetically, I think this
<br>
kind of thing would not succeed again even with no
<br>
additional security changes. Now passengers will
<br>
assume hijackers intend to use the plane as a bomb
<br>
and will willingly accept the risks to stop the 
<br>
hijacking.
