<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Aspirin plus antiplatelet drug dramatically reduces cardiovascular events
<br>
<p>In what has been called &quot;The biggest breakthrough in the fight against heart
<br>
disease for a generation,&quot; research published in the August 18 issue of The
<br>
Lancet and the August 16 New England Journal of Medicine showed that the
<br>
addition of clopidrogrel to aspirin reduces ischemic events in individuals
<br>
diagnosed with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, compared to those
<br>
taking aspirin alone.   Clopidrogrel is an oral antiplatelet drug that works
<br>
synergistically with aspirin's antiplatelet effect.   Antiplatelet drugs or
<br>
aspirin reduce the risk of thrombosis caused by ruptured or eroded
<br>
atherosclerotic plaque, which is the usual cause of acute coronary
<br>
syndromes.
<br>
<p>The CURE (Clopidrogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events) trial
<br>
recruited 12,562 patients who had been hospitalized within twenty-four hours
<br>
of experiencing symptoms.  Patients were randomly treated with a loading
<br>
dose of 300 mg clopidrogrel followed by 75 mg of the drug, along with 75 to
<br>
325 mg aspirin, or aspirin with a placebo, for three to twelve months.
<br>
Patients were followed up at discharge, one month, three months, and every
<br>
three months until the study's conclusion.
<br>
<p>The combination of aspirin and clopidrogrel was found to reduce the risk of
<br>
subsequent stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular
<br>
causes by 20 to 25 percent, compared to those who received aspirin alone.
<br>
The advantage of the combination of the two therapies was evident in the
<br>
first twenty-four hours of treatment, and was evident throughout the entire
<br>
follow-up period.   A reduction in heart failure occurred to the same degree
<br>
as a reduction in ischemic events, leading to the observation that the
<br>
reduction of ischemia could prevent heart failure. A study of a subgroup of
<br>
patients in patients pretreated with both aspirin and clopidrogrel who
<br>
received percutaneous coronary intervention such as angioplasty or stent
<br>
placement also showed lower rates of cardiovascular events within the first
<br>
thirty days of treatment.
<br>
<p>Clopidrogrel helped prevent heart attack, ischemia and stroke, with no
<br>
increase in hemorrhagic stroke, although there was an increased risk of
<br>
bleeding associated with the combination of the drug with aspirin.
<br>
<p><p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
Atherosclerosis associated with accelerated cellular aging
<br>
<p>In a article appearing in the August 11 2001 issue of The Lancet,
<br>
researchers discovered by examining telomeres that patients with coronary
<br>
artery disease had cellular aging comparable to that of individuals and
<br>
average 8.6 older. The researchers investigated the hypothesis that if
<br>
atherosclerosis were an inflammatory disease, characterized among other
<br>
things by increased cell turnover in response to injury, patients with the
<br>
disease might have evidence of early cellular aging.
<br>
<p>Blood was drawn from ten patients aged 42 to 72 with angiographically
<br>
determined severe triple-vessel coronary artery disease, and twenty control
<br>
patients of a comparable age range who did not have the disease, also
<br>
verified by angiography. The measurement of terminal restriction fragments
<br>
in white blood cell DNA allowed the determination of average telomere size.
<br>
Telomeres are caps at the ends of chromosomes which shorten with cellular
<br>
each cell division, hence longer telomeres indicate younger cellular aging.
<br>
There was a strong association observed between telomere shortening and age.
<br>
After adjustment for age and sex, individuals with coronary artery disease
<br>
had terminal restriction fragments that averaged 303 base pairs shorter than
<br>
controls, equivalent to someone approximately 8.6 years older.

<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Thrombosis prevention, by Calin V Pop, MD
<br>
<p>Preventing thrombosis is essential for living. All of us need to prevent
<br>
clots inside the circulatory system every single minute.
<br>
Coagulation-anticoagulation is a perfect &quot;mechanism&quot; that our body has to
<br>
maintain. If this process of keeping an optimal balance between coagulation
<br>
and anticoagulation fails, our lives can be in danger in a matter of
<br>
minutes.  What we need for optimal function is to keep blood flowing well in
<br>
all our vessels, whether small or big. When a leak (or damage) occurs in a
<br>
vessel, we need to encourage the coagulation aspect of this balance in order
<br>
to seal the leakage.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, whenever there is a significant disturbance in the blood
<br>
flow, the consequences are often lethal.
<br>
<p>People who take vitamin supplements are getting some protection against
<br>
thrombosis. Published studies show that people taking vitamin supplements
<br>
have reduced incidence of heart disease, stroke, and a host of other
<br>
diseases related to thrombosis.
<br>
<p>Prevention of blood clots is a complex task that involves keeping a fine
<br>
balance in place between the process of coagulation and anticoagulation.
<br>
Patients on prescription medication as well as any combination of these with
<br>
over-the-counter anti-inflammatories or aspirin need close monitoring by
<br>
periodic laboratory testing of their blood. Patients on supplements (such as
<br>
vitamins, herbs, or oils) need their risk factors (fibrinogen and
<br>
homocysteine) evaluated in the same way. However, a close monitoring of the
<br>
coagulation balance is not usually necessary in otherwise healthy people.

<p>Healthprin
<br>
<p>Numerous studies document the multiple health benefits of daily low dose
<br>
aspirin. Abnormal platelet aggregation, which induces clot formation within
<br>
blood vessels, can be inhibited by vitamins C and E, fish oil and herbal
<br>
extracts such as ginkgo biloba and bilberry. Aspirin, however, not only
<br>
provides similar protection from this major cause of heart attack and
<br>
stroke, but also inhibits the production of prostaglandin E2 and C-reactive
<br>
protein, which have been linked to many chronic inflammatory conditions.
<br>
Published studies indicate that only 81 mg daily is sufficient to prevent
<br>
heart attacks, and possibly, to prevent some forms of cancer.
<br>
<p>Consult with your physician if you are on anticoagulants, if you have a
<br>
blood clotting disorder, or if you have experienced hemorrhagic stroke.
<br>
Discontinue taking this product before surgery. For those at high risk for
<br>
hemorrhagic stroke, any amount of aspirin is contraindicated.
