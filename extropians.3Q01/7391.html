Forget what you thought:
<br>
&nbsp;Memory about to change, fast

by Rabiya S. Tuma, BioMedNet News
<br>
<p>Researchers have been slowly developing an image of how humans establish
<br>
memories, but that pace will likely accelerate this fall, with new work from
<br>
Susumu Tonegawa's lab. A groundbreaking study released today is just the first
<br>
of several due to appear in coming months.
<br>
Using standard approaches, but with an elegance not always achieved in
<br>
experimental design, Tonegawa's lab is set to unveil results illuminating how
<br>
short-term memories are turned into long-term ones via a process called
<br>
consolidation, how different types of learning occurs in unexpected ways, and
<br>
how memory recall occurs.
<br>
<p>The work is extremely important, says Alcino Silva, an associate professor of
<br>
neurobiology at the University of California-Los Angeles. He says he knows the
<br>
work intimately through discussions with Tonegawa. &quot;Many of the studies before
<br>
did not bridge what this study does,&quot; he told BioMedNet News in a telephone
<br>
interview.
<br>
<p>In his view, and in Tonegawa's as well, what stands out in this work is the
<br>
ability to connect what is happening at different levels of physiology, from
<br>
molecular pathways to cells, to cell circuits, and finally to behavior.
<br>
<p>In each of the studies, the first of which is published in today's issue of
<br>
Cell, the researchers combine the relatively new technology of transgenic mice
<br>
with older techniques like electrophysiology and behavioral studies.
<br>
<p>Significantly, in each study the transgenic animals carry conditional
<br>
knock-out mutations, so that only the part of the brain under study is
<br>
altered. The rest of the animal is unaffected, which helps to minimize
<br>
confounding effects.
<br>
<p>&quot;This new thrust, this new approach is flourishing,&quot; said Tonegawa today.
<br>
&quot;Before, people could not do this. The method of studying the underlying
<br>
mechanism for memory was rather restricted. People studied learning and memory
<br>
at certain levels of complexity: psychologists studied behavior,
<br>
pharmacologists studied the effect of drugs on behaviors...&quot;
<br>
<p>But this approach in combination with the more traditional ones allows
<br>
scientists to connect the levels, and that is what makes it so powerful.
<br>
<p>For example, in today's Cell paper Tonegawa's group shows that
<br>
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) is required for the
<br>
consolidation of short-term memories into long-term stable ones. Previously,
<br>
there was evidence that protein kinase A (PKA) was involved in the process,
<br>
but with the new data, it is clear that &quot;they work hand-in-hand,&quot; said
<br>
Tonegawa. And perhaps most importantly, he says, they can distinguish what is
<br>
happening at these different levels of complexity when CaMKIV is missing from
<br>
the forebrain.
<br>
<p>The current study involves memories which are learned by repeated exposure,
<br>
like one might learn a piece of music. But a second study, which will be out
<br>
later this fall in Cell, describes how memories from a one-time event, such as
<br>
when one meets a friend for a special dinner, are established. Finally,
<br>
Tonegawa says the third body of work, which has been discussed at scientific
<br>
meetings but which he declined to discuss until it is in press, involves the
<br>
mechanism of memory recall.
<br>
<p>&quot;This will be a very exciting period in the next two years,&quot; predicted
<br>
Tonegawa. &quot;The field of learning and memory will advance very fast.&quot;

analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
