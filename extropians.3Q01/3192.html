<p><em>&gt; Just out of curiosity, I'm wondering how many on this list feel they came up

<p>I've been reading science fiction since about 1960, when I was ten
<br>
years old. There were singularity precursors of many types, but
<br>
most science fiction writers missed the computer revolution and
<br>
therefore the most likely path to the Singularity. I read
<br>
Vinge's &quot;True Names&quot; in 1980, and immediately started thinking
<br>
in those terms. I read Vinge's &quot;Marooned in Realtime,&quot; with
<br>
its essay on the singularity, the year it was published.
<br>
<p>I did not actually begin thinking about the timescales until
<br>
I got my home network connection, started surfing, and found
<br>
Anders' site, in 1995. At that point I realized that the
<br>
singularity is the maximum-liklihood future and that it may
<br>
arrive essentially at any time: highly likely before 2006,
<br>
almost certainly before 2015, and only a civilization-wide
<br>
catastrophe can stop it before 2020. This is no longer an
<br>
abstract, far-future philosophical event, but is well within
<br>
my personal planning horizon.
