<p><em>&gt; The USA doesn't have the highest standard of living in the western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world because of the way the rich feed off the poor there.
</em><br>
<p>I'd rather hear a couple of concise paragraphs that had an
<br>
argument in them, rather that just a throw-away line like
<br>
that looks like it's designed to incite some flames.  (If I
<br>
got on to a list dominated by socialists, and I wanted to
<br>
challenge their beliefs, I'd try to get them to examine some
<br>
deep seated value that they held differently from me.)
<br>
<p>The difference between the richest and poorest Austrialians is
<br>
a factor in wealth of perhaps a hundred thousand to one.  You 
<br>
could start by explaining why the rich aren't feeding off the
<br>
poor in the countries that you approve of.  Another short paragraph
<br>
could describe a potential solution, how some vanguard of the
<br>
people could cause wealth to be equally distributed, perhaps
<br>
along the lines of &quot;from each according to his ability, and to
<br>
each according to his need&quot;.
<br>
<p>It would, of course, be asking a lot to wonder if you'd be
<br>
interested in perusing Hayek and trying to spot the flaws.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Reagan, with his heavily pro-market-economy stance gave USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the distinction of the highest infant mortality rate in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed world. [Maybe this is a good time to don my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asbestos suit.]
</em><br>
<p>Another declaration completely bereft of evidence, explanation,
<br>
or argument.  Is this the sort of flame that you were hoping for?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nature, red in tooth and claw is a 19th century concept. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is only half of the picture. Altruism is the other half.
</em><br>
<p>That is exactly correct.  In the last two decades, anthropologists
<br>
and ethologists have pretty well established that human altruism
<br>
is genetic.  The mechanisms are described at length in Matt Ridley's
<br>
&quot;The Origins of Virtue&quot;, and Sarah Hrdy's &quot;Mother Nature&quot;, among
<br>
several other books that I could name.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The really cool thing about humans is this incredible brain we possess. We 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know where the next brilliant mind will come from. The little kid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose mother is barely scraping by on welfare may be the one who solves the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem of non-destructively scanning the human brain for uploading.
</em><br>
<p>Anything is possible.  That same little kid could turn out to be
<br>
a drug kingpin.  What do you think the respective chances are?
<br>
Then consider the oldest child of the youngest man and wife 
<br>
research team at the Mayo Clinic.  Their kid too could turn out
<br>
to be either the problem solver you alluded to or the drug kingpin
<br>
that I mentioned.  The chances, as you know, are not the same,
<br>
doubtless because the evil capitalists are grinding people down :-)
