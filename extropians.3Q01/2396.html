<em>&gt; &gt; For me &quot;immortality&quot; doesn't necessarily mean living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unto infinity.  I have a hunch that after a few billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; years my curiosity will be pretty much satiated, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'll be ready to &quot;give up the ghost.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Fat chance.  If you get on any decent path of personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolution at all, you'll come to love living more and more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This &quot;boredom&quot; that worries you --- curiosity satiation---
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remember, is a highly specific processes evolved by our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;primitive brains to aid survival.  We are speaking here
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of *millions* of years from now.  And sorry to be blunt,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but it's pretty dumb to go about supposing that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fantastically enhanced &quot;you&quot; of the far future would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experience the same &quot;hunches&quot; you do now.
</em><br>
<p>I don't discount the possibility that a &quot;fantastically enhanced&quot; me would 
<br>
feel differently than I do.  But then a &quot;fantastically enhanced&quot; me would 
<br>
not be *me*.  I don't doubt that human curiosity was a great asset essential 
<br>
to our survival and domination of the planet.  However, I don't foresee that 
<br>
curiosity will ever be evolved out of us.  If you're not curious, what's the 
<br>
point?  *You* might want to live just for the sake of living, but for me its 
<br>
learning answers to new questions and experiencing something new.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying that's how everyone is, or should be, but that's how I am.  I 
<br>
was once big into motocross, loved it.  Did it for a few years and 
<br>
eventually sold my bike.  Then I was big into mountain biking, still am but 
<br>
I can only get to the top of the mountain so many times before my motivation 
<br>
to keep doing it over and over starts to peter out.  Now its inline skating. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love it, but once I master it I'm sure it'll only be so many times up and 
<br>
back the bike path before the thrill starts to fade.  Call me fickle, but 
<br>
that's me.
<br>
<p>At some point in time, whether its a hundred, a thousand, or a trillion 
<br>
years into the future, I am bound to run out of new experiences, interesting 
<br>
questions, new frontiers.  I don't imagine any of us will ever be 
<br>
omniscient, so I suppose there will always be *something* new to learn or 
<br>
some ultimate theory to disprove.  But once it starts getting to the point 
<br>
where it takes 99.9% of effort to make a 0.1% advance, no doubt about 
<br>
it...I'm bored.
<br>
<p>&quot;Are you sure you want to move Zero to the Recycle Bin?  This file cannot be 
<br>
recovered.&quot;  Yes - delete.

<p>Life is good.  Refuse to die.
