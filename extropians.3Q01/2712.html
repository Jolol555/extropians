From: Alex F. Bokov 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The toughest one for me is:
</em><br>
<p>&quot;How do you know that only the rich and powerful won't be the ones to
<br>
benefit, thus worsening the lock-in effect?&quot;
<br>
<p>Don't have a good general-case answer for that. It certainly scares
<br>
me.&lt;
<br>
<p>I explain this by referencing other technologies such as the telephone, television, computers and cell phones.  At first, only those with money or connections had them.  Today, in downtown Los Angeles, there are more Mexicans using cell phones than executives.  Currently, most everyone has a TV, or access to one.  Remember when a well-known scientist (name intentionally left out) asked, &quot;Why would anyone want a computer in their homes?&quot;  (paraphrasing).  Today, almost everyone has a computer in his home, or access to one.  
<br>
<p>If the rich and powerful get the benefits first soon others will be getting it too.  The irony to this concern is that maybe it is beneficial for the poor if the wealthy and well-connected people do get it first and pass it along as a tax write-off.
<br>
<p>I'm not scared about this issue at all. I don't see the rich and powerful as frightening.  I rather enjoy many of them. :-)
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
Natasha
