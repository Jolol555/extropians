Purely speculative and anecdotal on my part. However, the _range_ of stuff
<br>
on offer is increasing, and that's a market that is highly price-sensitive
<br>
and very competitive. I doubt supermarkets would be so full of Indian-
<br>
restaurant-in-a-bag-ready-to-microwave packaged meals if there wasn't a 
<br>
growing market for them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; And what are the implications for
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Potentially important. Medical improvements are also problematic in much the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same way that software improvements are. Antibiotics are clearly a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolutionary technology. Techniques like telesurgery or focused radiation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatments are harder to call out as their own revolutions, though they may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the potential to become as important as antibiotics.
</em><br>
<p>I missed out microsurgery. Thirty years ago, if you lost a finger or 
<br>
a hand -- tough. These days, pack it in ice and take it along and there's
<br>
a good chance that not only can they re-attach it, but they can even save
<br>
some neural connections.
<br>
<p>Organ transplants: in 1971, heart transplants were -- publicity aside --
<br>
grand-standing experimentation. Today, thanks to much better immunosupressant
<br>
agents, many people can run for years or decades on replacement organs. We
<br>
wouldn't have the Chinese government harvesting organs from executed felons
<br>
(a la Larry Niven) if it wasn't a technology that had arrived.
<br>
<p>Again: the laser. In 1960 it was a miracle of quantum mechanics
<br>
that required expensive synthetic rubies and demonstrated a physical
<br>
principle. By 1970, some expensive military applications had shown up --
<br>
rangefingers, for example -- and holography was becoming a curiosity. By
<br>
1980, there was suddenly a market, with the advent of the CD player. By
<br>
1990, holography was becoming commercialised as something you can make
<br>
prints of, and CD players were everywhere. Today, I have a £5 laser
<br>
pointer for playing with my cat, and dentists use 'em for de-scaling
<br>
teeth and drilling out dental caries.
<br>
<p>Yes, it was there before 1970. But the mass production and commercialisation
<br>
wasn't.
