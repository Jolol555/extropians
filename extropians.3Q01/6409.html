</em><br>
<p>Until the rise of muslim fundamentalism in the 1400s. The popular
<br>
revisionist claims are that muslims never hurt jews, yet there were
<br>
persistent campaigns to force conversion, and the 'second class citizen'
<br>
discrmination is the same thing that the muslims have generally claimed
<br>
is Israels treatment of palestinians. Why put an expiration date on
<br>
injustice?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; I don't think you can brush over the history of these peoples.  Afghanistan is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a poor, violent, country, which got abused by the Soviets.  The Palestinians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were among the most well-off and educated of the Arabs, before they got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invaded by the Jews and then crushed between them and the Arab armies.
</em><br>
<p>Most palestinians are generally descended from jews forced to convert to
<br>
islam in order to escape second class citizenship to rise in the Ottoman
<br>
Empire.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole region's poor, resource-poor, and colonialized enough to develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grievances and not enough to pick up good habits.  Except maybe for Iraq,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Only demonstrating that religious fanatics don't have a monopoly on
<br>
extremism. I would hardly call the Baathist party a 'good' secular
<br>
movement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; with sanctions, come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poverty; with poverty, comes religion, and veils on women...  The revolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Iran has something to do with with our support of the oppressive Shah.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet, Iran seems to have the most democratic structure of any Arab country (not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Iran is Arabic); it's just that the democratic decisions get overruled by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the clerics.  But there's movement toward moderation.
</em><br>
<p>The persians were always the elite in the Ottoman world up until the
<br>
ascendancy of the Turks. The Shah provided western freedoms, which
<br>
offended the clerics, but the 'elected' prime minister we ousted was a
<br>
Soviet pawn as well. The Shiite idea of freedom was the freedom to
<br>
oppress anyone who isn't a cleric. The Pahlavis at least had a
<br>
historical record of leadership and stability. They weren't created out
<br>
of thin air.
