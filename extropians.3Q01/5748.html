Doyne Farmer Looks Back
<br>
By Nina Mehta

<br>
Starting a financial trading firm was anything but easy for physicists Doyne
<br>
Farmer and Norman Packard. Even agreeing on a suitable name was difficult. But
<br>
after dismissing Infinite Regress, Nostradamus, The Vision Thing and Dukes of
<br>
Destiny, they settled on Prediction Company-a name that calmly summed up the
<br>
firm's intention to foretell the future of the markets.
<br>
<p>The story of the company's tumultuous evolution roars through Thomas Bass' The
<br>
Predictors: How a Band of Maverick Physicists Used Chaos Theory to Trade Their
<br>
Way to A Fortune on Wall Street.
<br>
<p>Did the firm make money? Yes, indeed, and lots of it. Did it take money from
<br>
the capital markets like candy from a child? Not exactly.
<br>
<p>Farmer, Packard and a motley crew of five other physicists, plus one
<br>
non-physicist, launched Prediction Company in 1991, determined to use chaos
<br>
theory to split the markets open and extract valuable patterns of information
<br>
from the murky soup of bond and stock prices. Farmer and Packard, the company'
<br>
s globetrotting stars, were two of the five physicists who, in the late 1970s,
<br>
had formed the Chaos Cabal in the graduate physics department at the
<br>
University of California at Santa Cruz-a ragtag group that helped launch the
<br>
field that launched a thousand dissertations and now feeds academic
<br>
departments around the world.
<br>
<p>&quot;We started out assuming that simply using sophisticated time-series
<br>
techniques would give us a clear advantage that would allow us to make
<br>
profits,&quot; Farmer says now. &quot;But we found there were no magic bullets. We had
<br>
to think harder about how the markets worked and structure our models to make
<br>
the data speak to us. The data didn't speak to us automatically.&quot;
<br>
<p>There were discouraging times. The firm didn't get off the ground immediately,
<br>
and it was three years after the firm settled into its offices, within sight
<br>
of the Sangre de Cristos (Blood of Christ) mountains, that it was trading in
<br>
earnest-and several years after that &quot;before we were really trading in a way
<br>
that was profitable,&quot; says Farmer. Along the way, there were several false
<br>
starts, and the company went for months without making a profit. The
<br>
Predictors swings through the highs and lows of the company, from paying for
<br>
office furniture to hauling the company dog-and-pony show to the kingpins of
<br>
Wall Street in search of a funding partner. (The Chicago-based O'Connor &amp;
<br>
Associates wound up spouse.)
<br>
<p>There were also surprises. &quot;It was easier to get Wall Street interested than
<br>
we had thought,&quot; recalls Farmer. &quot;Perhaps the timing was right, or they just
<br>
liked our sales pitch. Also, I think Norman and I underestimated the value of
<br>
our credentials-they were taken seriously.&quot; One thing that wasn't so easy,
<br>
however, was the day-to-day logistics of production-&quot;actually running the
<br>
models in live trading proved to be harder than we imagined,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>Management also proved to be something of a briar patch for Packard and
<br>
Farmer, who had previously run a small company that tried to beat the roulette
<br>
wheel in Las Vegas with a toe-operated computer. (Bass recounted that
<br>
hardscrabble effort in an earlier book,The Eudaemonic Pie.) &quot;It was difficult
<br>
learning to listen to other people, and learning to understand other people's
<br>
psychology well enough to keep them happy and get them to work hard,&quot; says
<br>
Farmer. &quot;Frankly, I had assumed that since I was outgoing and liked people
<br>
that would have been easier.&quot;
<br>
<p>So what are the Dukes of Destiny doing now?
<br>
<p>Packard remains at Prediction, modeling the future as CEO of the 24-person
<br>
firm, which now advises UBS on how to use Prediction Company models to control
<br>
a proprietary fund (O'Connor wound up in the kitty of the Swiss bank). Farmer
<br>
is at the Santa Fe Institute, developing a nonequilibrium theory for price
<br>
formation based on likening the financial strategies developed by &quot;agents&quot; in
<br>
the markets to the evolution of biological species. &quot;If patterns in the market
<br>
are equivalent to food sources, for instance, speculators can formulate
<br>
strategies to exploit those patterns for profit, just as animals fight for
<br>
sources of food,&quot; he explains.
<br>
<p>In the offing: If not another book, then at least a mathematical food-fight
<br>
theory to make sense of the ever-dyspeptic financial markets.

<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most

regressive force now operating in society.
