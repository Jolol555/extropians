</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question of whether you're financially better off flooding the Caspian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or converting to a non-fossil-fuel economy is an empirical question.  $5
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trillion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounds reasonable to me - on very weak information - for the cost of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are the refs on the conversion cost?  And how does it change if you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it incrementally ( ie new equipment is hydrogen economy; old equipment is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retained for its economic lifespan).
</em><br>
<p>Lemme re-search. Its been a while since I delved into the economic
<br>
reports. The problem with incremental is that you wind up with very poor
<br>
market penetration until the infrastructure is nearly complete, since
<br>
people already have gas stations everywhere, the hydrogen distribution
<br>
system can't compete until it has similar coverage because the
<br>
difference in coverage is a disincentive against individuals purchasing
<br>
new hydrogen cars, and until there are enough hydrogen cars, hydrogen
<br>
sales volume is very low, so overhead costs are distributed among fewer
<br>
gallons so its per gallon cost is higher, which is another disincentive
<br>
against buying hydrogen cars. You'd have to heavily tax gasoline to pay
<br>
for the hydrogen infrastructure, and until it is built you have a severe
<br>
drag on the economy that wastes and pollutes more than a fit economy.
<br>
Hydrogen can't use conventional gas lines or tanks because it's so
<br>
corrosive, power plants need to be built to produce hydrogen gas from
<br>
nuclear energy (a 10-20 year process in itself), every gas station needs
<br>
to be outfitted with hydrogen tanks and pumps (which are also much
<br>
larger and less safe than gasoline tanks and pumps due to the
<br>
pressure/cryogenic details), all new tanks on fuel tankers (ships, train
<br>
cars, and trucks) need to be built.
<br>
<p>Conversely, digging a channel from the Black Sea to the Caspian is
<br>
simply a matter of operating several large tunnel boring machines boring
<br>
on a level, building the penstock behind them, installing turbines and
<br>
gates. I'd say each Caspian channel would equal the cost of the Chunnel.
<br>
Those would work fine for the first stage of filling: up to sea level.
<br>
Then you'd need a similar set at, say, 50 or 100 meter intervals of
<br>
altitude, and sealed off and filled with concrete when they are too low
<br>
to be efficiently used for pumping. I'd estimate that the Caspian
<br>
project could be built for less than $100 billion. As for land sales,
<br>
buying the new waterfront property ahead of time and selling it to the
<br>
displaced persons would help out immeasurably, not to mention that there
<br>
should be at least 10 years in which to move as much valuable indutrial
<br>
or other property as possible.
