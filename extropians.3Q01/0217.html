</em><br>
<p>Depressingly stupid, isn't it? The fact that Dr Hayflick is prominent in
<br>
speaking for this view is even more depressing. Here's what I said about
<br>
that claim in THE LAST MORTAL GENERATION:
<br>
<p>&lt; A youthful 300-year-old with a fresh body and undamaged brain will
<br>
presumably be wiser, perhaps more set in his or her ways than an
<br>
adolescent, but nonetheless without the crotchety traits the old exhibit
<br>
due to their physical deterioration, and the frustrations and sourness that
<br>
can entail. On the contrary - we will have time to learn and attempt all
<br>
things - especially, as the optimistic novelist Robert Heinlein wrote, time
<br>
enough for love.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall that editorial I quoted earlier. It ended, to my horrified
<br>
disbelief: `Dying (we think) is not all that bad.' Frankly, I can't think
<br>
of anything to be said in its favour. I was no less taken aback to find
<br>
similar opinions expressed in a 1997 Scientific American review by the
<br>
fabled Leonard Hayflick, one of the world's premier biogerontologists and
<br>
pioneer in cell replication work. When an expert of Hayflick's standing
<br>
speaks, one must listen with due respect - but in this case I disagree
<br>
powerfully with his conventional opinion:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have always worried about the enormous power that humans will have if
<br>
we ever learn how either to tamper with the aging process or to extend our
<br>
longevity - it is unclear whether people could cope with the psychological,
<br>
economic, medical and cultural changes that would accompany vastly extended
<br>
life spans, even should they prove physiologically possible... Although
<br>
aging and death put an end to the lives of good citizens, they also make
<br>
finite the lives of tyrants, murderers and a broad spectrum of other
<br>
undesirables. Much of the continuing massive destruction of this planet and
<br>
the consequent ills that this destruction produces for humans can be traced
<br>
to overpopulation, a phenomenon that appears to show no sign of abating.
<br>
Extending the life of a population that already strains global resources
<br>
is, in the view of many, unconscionable. If the price to be paid for the
<br>
beneficial results of aging and death is its universal applicability, we
<br>
should all pay that price - as we always have.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is a confused, sadly short-sighted estimate, in my view. True, society
<br>
will convulse, in one way or another, as we learn to cope with extended and
<br>
then indefinite life. That is no reason to prohibit the technology, or slow
<br>
its development. Civilisation has already undergone shocking changes in
<br>
mortality with the introduction of clean water and air, antiseptic
<br>
childbirth, medicine and surgery, and plentiful nutritious food in the
<br>
advanced sectors of the world. Would we be better off electing a kind of
<br>
mad social amnesia, burning our medical books, closing all the hospitals,
<br>
banning pharmaceuticals? Some say yes - well, let them retreat to their
<br>
backward redoubts and live that way, but don't allow them to set society's
<br>
health agendas. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, Hayflick's premises are erroneous. Why should extending the
<br>
life of a population, even one that already strains global resources, be
<br>
`unconscionable'? Buried in that critique is an indefensible
<br>
generalisation: that longer life necessarily means more offspring. In
<br>
rabbits or squid, perhaps that would be so. Human have intelligence and
<br>
foresight, when they care to use it. As Anders Sandberg, a Swedish
<br>
transhumanist and neuroscientist, observes: `This is another of the
<br>
&quot;classic arguments&quot;, and quite wrong (lifespan only changes the size of the
<br>
population, not the rate of increase; if overpopulation is a problem then
<br>
it has to be managed by family planning anyway).' We shall return to this
<br>
issue of population dynamics at the end of this book.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a more poignant objection: would it not be morally preferable to
<br>
spend research money helping the sick and undernourished in the Third
<br>
World, rather than expending a fortune extending the lives of the
<br>
already-rich? Geneticist Michael Rose, at the University of California,
<br>
Irvine, has nearly doubled Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) life spans
<br>
by breeding a hardy variety with improved superoxide dismutase genes, and
<br>
argues that we can do the same for humans. Still, Rose has remarked that
<br>
while prolonging life is preferable to such audacious scientific feats as
<br>
manned landings on the moon, it's `not better than vaccinating all the
<br>
children of the Third World'. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This apparent conflict of interests, I believe, is rhetorical only. Must
<br>
health efforts in one place necessarily be at the expense of those in
<br>
another, when both could be funded? True, society's resources are limited
<br>
(although immense), and need to be allocated with a due sense of
<br>
proportion, but is there a more reasonable and satisfying way to spend part
<br>
of them than in defeating death? Universal vaccination will save many
<br>
millions of lives, and certainly should be funded - but each of those lives
<br>
will only be saved for a maximum of a century or so. Life extension has the
<br>
potential to save them, and us, for millennia.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of Hayflick's cost-benefit analysis based on the prevalence and
<br>
persistence of tyrants? Is it a strong argument for throttling the new
<br>
science in its cradle? Surely not. Let us all die, to save a few from the
<br>
heinous attacks of murderers? Kill everyone, by inattention, to spare us
<br>
from the malevolence of dictators? In 1997, cryonics commentator Tim
<br>
Freeman made the retort apposite: 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Suppose all reasonably free people got an aging prevention treatment
<br>
tomorrow. So we'd eliminate the meaningless deaths of millions of talented
<br>
and productive people in the US, Europe, places like that, but let's
<br>
suppose for the purposes of argument that Saddam Hussein and the like would
<br>
stay in power indefinitely, and the conditions of their subjects would be
<br>
unchanged forever. Would that be a net win? In my opinion, it would be,
<br>
even from a global utilitarian viewpoint instead of the obvious selfish
<br>
viewpoint of a US resident.&quot;
<br>
<p>But is it even likely that the conditions of the oppressed could remain
<br>
unchanged forever?  Dictators and other bullies are always with us, for new
<br>
monsters readily spring up to replace the old - who are often slain by the
<br>
new, in any case. The remedy for death by terror and war is not involuntary
<br>
`natural' death for everyone, however peaceful. It is not universal,
<br>
DNA-programmed mortality, but political awareness and action. Freeman
<br>
added, astutely, `Hayflick wasn't properly weighing the ordinary horror of
<br>
aging that strikes the large populations that are not affected by tyrants.
<br>
This is a common psychological error ? people undervalue ordinary dangers,
<br>
and overvalue unusual dangers.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're stuck, at the moment, with death's pain, loss and grief, and must
<br>
make as decent a fist of it as we can. But in the longest term of the
<br>
history of intelligent life in the universe, it will surely be the case -
<br>
tragic, but blessedly brief in comparative duration - that the routine and
<br>
inevitable death of conscious beings was a temporary error, quickly
<br>
corrected. &gt;
