<p>
Robert started this fine thread with a number of very
<br>
interesting remarks, such as
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What happens is a country comes to the IMF for a loan.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMF says ok, but the conditions are that you have to lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any barriers to imports (because free trade is a good thing).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The country says ok.  So what happens is in comes a flood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of foreign goods, esp. U.S. food, produced by corporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agri-business.
</em><br>
<p>While it is very important and vital to wonder (as some have)
<br>
whether the exporting countries are &quot;dumping&quot;, i.e., selling
<br>
produce at below market prices for various kinds of evil 
<br>
advantages, I am curious about the case that might obtain
<br>
even if there were no dumping.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These come in at prices lower than foods can be produced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domestically and as a result the Jamaican farmers are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driven out of business.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, they're driven out of business---perhaps even in the
<br>
case where some technologically advanced country simply
<br>
*can* produce the goods more cheaply.  But someone in 
<br>
Jamaica still has money to buy the foreign goods.  How
<br>
is that money made?  Why can't the farmers do whatever
<br>
those people are doing?  If there is a reason that the
<br>
farmers can't do *that*, then what else can the farmers
<br>
productively do?
<br>
<p>I seem to recall that even if country A can make X more
<br>
cheaply than country Y can, then (under some circumstance
<br>
that I can't recall), country Y should still produce X.
<br>
