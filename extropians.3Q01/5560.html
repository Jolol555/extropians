<p>Seems the road to hell is paved with bad intentions too... and ignorance, 
<br>
and neglect. We could choose those roads... or we could try to work out 
<br>
what is damaging things when things do get broken. I intend to have my own 
<br>
company shortly (instead of being freelance as I am at present). If I am to 
<br>
run a company it is in my interests to know how to avoid doing a shitty job.
<br>
<p>It is the business of shareholders to know that some exec is ferreting away 
<br>
millions of their money while driving the company into the wall.
<br>
<p>The little old lady who has sunk her life's savings into the company might 
<br>
feel it is her business.
<br>
<p>The employee who has sweated and slaved to make the company work has a good 
<br>
reason to want to know if the CEO is blindly destroying the company for the 
<br>
sake of his pleasure trips and mistresses.
<br>
<p>When we impact other people with our actions then our actions become their 
<br>
business. If we do well by them then they won't impede our progress and may 
<br>
even help us, but if we screw them over badly then we should not be 
<br>
surprised when they want to slap us down. Right? Wrong? It's kinda 
<br>
irrelevant isn't it? It is just how it is.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
