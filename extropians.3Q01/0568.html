<p><em>&gt;I will eventually share some of the actuality of what I do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spirituality in my life if you wish. But it is not easy as there has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;long been a tension inside of me between various parts of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spirituality and science and scientific or perhaps scientistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worldview.
</em><br>
<p>It is rare to find people who have integrated (and I mean
<br>
*integrated*) the scientific and 'spiritual' (ok, using quotes)
<br>
aspects of oneself because it's *hard*. Usually I've seen in
<br>
scientists, who are also religious, some peculiar blinders set
<br>
around their spriritual world. I'm not sure how integrated my own
<br>
process is, but it's been going on more than 10 years now,
<br>
re-working and refining and re-living. The only person who I know,
<br>
for sure, that has accomplished an integration of their spiritual
<br>
and scientific world is a very good friend, who is an atmospheric
<br>
chemist, and a Zen Budhhist teacher, and she is currently advising
<br>
congress-critters about environmental policy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To be honest I am afraid of being shunned from conversations I care
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about by people I respect and care about where my views and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;practices are too much at odds with what some may believe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reasonable and respectable. It doesn't feel very safe.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not afraid, because it's already happened to me :-(
<br>
<p>Try explaining 'synchronicity', for example, to someone who has not
<br>
spent much time with their inner world, and so then, see how
<br>
far you can go.
<br>
<p>[My definition of synchronicity: Consciously or unconsciously you
<br>
*know* the things that you like/want/need/good-for-you, therefore your
<br>
senses are highly tuned and sensitive to that item in your
<br>
environment. So then, some event that might be considered a
<br>
coincidence to someone else, takes on a special meaning to you: a
<br>
&quot;meaningful coincidence&quot;, i.e. synchronicity. Often it turns out
<br>
that that particular occurrence was exacly what you needed, whether
<br>
or not you were aware of its importance at the time. Hopefully you
<br>
_were_ aware and hopefully you _did_ notice and _act_ on it.
<br>
Awareness. The more aware that you are of the workings of your inner
<br>
world, the more synchronous events in your outer world will occur.]
<br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Neat. But I still have very little sense at all of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you're trying to convey when &quot;spirituality&quot; or &quot;religiousity&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; pops up in your sentences.
</em><br>
(Samantha:)
<br>
<em>&gt;I am not very sure I wish to try to convey much of what it is to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here. Partially because my own attempting to find a balance that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fits is a delicate process. Partially because I don't feel this is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very safe environment for simply sharing much of what I deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outside of more common mutual grounds of interaction. I will have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consider how much I want to say at this time and get back to you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Also, there is the matter of the generality of spirituality vs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the specifics of my spirituality. I don't want the generality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the question and the issues to be lost in the specifics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;directly relevant to me.
</em><br>
<p>I think that a definition about 'spirituality' is highly individual
<br>
because it _must_ emerge out of one's own inner explorations, and
<br>
therefore it is almost impossible to separate the individual's
<br>
belief/philosophical system and the individual's practices.
<br>
<p>Shall I try to describe some aspects of what _I_ mean by
<br>
'spirituality'? (I don't know how close Samantha and I are on this,
<br>
but I suspect that we have a little overlap) Maybe this will help
<br>
facilitate some understanding in this conversation.
<br>
<p>_Some_ aspects of _my_ spirituality:
<br>
<p>I believe that there is a deep wisdom in my environment, it only
<br>
requires me to be aware of it, to look, to probe, to see, to
<br>
understand. It's like recognizing a god in ourselves and in every
<br>
human and every thing, but without the concept of a supernatural
<br>
creator. In addition, the environment present around me is also a
<br>
result of processes in the past, and there is a deep wisdom there,
<br>
as well. My own peculiar bent on this 'recognition' results in being
<br>
in awe of all things *living*; for me it's the most divine thing
<br>
that I can think of, that is,  that I am alive and that other things
<br>
are alive and this world and Universe exists. I don't know what
<br>
better word than 'awe', at the fact that we exist. A psychological
<br>
effect of my awe, is that often the smallest, most inconsequential
<br>
things in my environment seem to me to be the most profound:
<br>
footsteps in sand, the smell of garlic and onion, hearing children
<br>
laughing (or crying), and so on.
<br>
<p>A corollary to the above arises from my physics knowledge plus some
<br>
very basic level of trust (and naivte): I am deeply connected to my
<br>
environment. One can trace the physics, biology, etc. to show these
<br>
relationships hold, but I'm convinced. The result of that
<br>
connectedness for me has a profound psychological effect too: I can
<br>
make it through rough times when I 'feel' my connectedness. My
<br>
connectedness knowledge seeps in my morals and value system, as
<br>
well. Usually that's good, but the result is that I'm highly
<br>
sensitive, with almost no boundaries, so my personal struggles lie in
<br>
that direction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From my spiritual view, I believe that the answers (to any questions
</em><br>
that we have) are *in us* and *around us*. This is one place where
<br>
cultural history and mythology can play an important role. Humans
<br>
have experienced and worked out amazing things, and their intellectual
<br>
and emotional paths are in front of us, if we *only pay attention*.
<br>
I.e., The symbols are in front of us in the stories of the lives of
<br>
our human ancestors, if we know how to read and understand the
<br>
systems and symbols and then know how to apply those systems and
<br>
symbols to our own (present) lives.
