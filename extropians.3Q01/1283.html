<p>Ever heard of Losec? Exactly why was that a huge commercial success for
<br>
Astra, if they could have gone on selling palliatives for ulcers instead?
<br>
Now the market for ulcer treatments is much smaller.
<br>

You are likely thinking of why so little is spent on malaria vaccines and
<br>
cures for other tropical diseases. That is a real problem, but the issue
<br>
isn't that cures are unprofitable (they aren't) but that it is hard to make
<br>
any profit commensurable with the investment in the current regulatory
<br>
climate. The base costs of pharmaceutical development are high, and if you
<br>
try to get FDA approval or something like it they will be even greater.
<br>
That will make the potential market in the developing countries small, and
<br>
given the latest anti-patent moves on pharmaceuticals you might end up
<br>
funding competitors instead. If you just sell something less well tested
<br>
cheaply or do the tests in the developing nations you will be crucified in
<br>
the media as a ruthless profiteer exploiting the poor. It is a lose-lose
<br>
situation which any sensible corporation will try to stay out from, leaving
<br>
it to far less well funded organisations. Too bad. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I just hope you become head of a huge medical corporation Anders. The world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit enormously. It would do capitalism's cause a great service.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks. I'll try that after solving the problem of memory and turning
<br>
transhumanism into the next big thing (only half joking :-).
