I'm still fiddling with bylaws for the Longevity Meme. I've read more
<br>
Section 2s in the last month than I care to read again for a while...so time
<br>
to ask for (non-legal) commentary. I'm a big fan of general statements over
<br>
specific statements, but the IRS looks at you funny if you don't get at
<br>
least a little way into specifics.
<br>
<p>The relevant excerpt is below; the crude summary would be that the Longevity
<br>
Meme will be attempting to educate the masses and inspire a significant
<br>
fraction of them to want to extend their lives. This differs from the
<br>
admirable goals of existing organizations by the emphasis on media,
<br>
community building, and the level of cultural sophistication of the target
<br>
demographics. I think I need a better way of clearly defining that
<br>
demographic beyond &quot;general public&quot;...
<br>
<p>But anyway, comments, suggestions, catcalls, additions please. The comments
<br>
of those on the list who have already done the whole 501(c)(3) thing
<br>
(multiple times in some cases) are especially welcome.
