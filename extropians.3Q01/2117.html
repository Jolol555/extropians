<p><em>    &gt; No. A conical shape will deflect a much greater amount of radar energy
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; when it is coming from head on than from the side, while a balloon will
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; have the exact same radar signature during the entire trajectory. Thus,
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; the sig of the warhead will increase in strength as its angle of
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; incidence to the radar signal increases, and decoys will be filtered out
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; as that occurs.
</em><br>
<p>A trivial problem that can be solved very cheaply of course as I pointed out more than
<br>
once, but you don't want it solved, star wars wouldn't work then,  that's why you don't put
<br>
the real conical warhead in a round balloon in your scenario. The trouble is, an enemy
<br>
might do things differently, unlike you he just might want to do things that make it hard
<br>
for star wars not easy.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; the ephemerides of a heavy warhead versus a light decoy will show
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; themselves by midcourse. [...] mass differences will show the greatest effect
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; at the apogee point in the trajectory, long before it hits air.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps in some parallel universe things work that way but not in this one,
<br>
as any high school physics student would tell you, if not an eighth grade
<br>
science class.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;A Missile doesn't follow a circular orbit, it  is elliptical [...]
</em><br>
<p>Planets and most satellites are in elliptical orbits, missiles aren't in orbit at all and
<br>
their trajectory is not elliptical, it's parabolic.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Again: What is the point of using decoys?
</em><br>
<p>Again: They weigh almost nothing, they take up almost no room in the rocket,
<br>
they move just like the real warhead in a vacuum and are as cheap as toy balloons.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;you need to remove a  real warhead to put in one or more decoys
</em><br>
<p>Right, I'm sure it would never occur to an enemy to wait until the rocket was
<br>
in space to inflate the decoy balloons, the decoys would be at full size even
<br>
as the rocket sat on the launch pad.
<br>
&nbsp;I will concede the a perfect ICBM defense is possible provided the enemy is
<br>
a gang of imbeciles.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; This was dealing with John's inane notion of having all IRV be spherical.
</em><br>
<p>BALLOONS!! I NEVER SAID ONE WORD ABOUT A SPHERICAL REENTRY WARHEAD!
<br>
Not one fucking word.
