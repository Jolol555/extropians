<p>Okay, here are comments from people with more knowledge. I have no direct
<br>
personal knowledge of US aid to Israel, only what I've read or heard. I do
<br>
have direct personal knowledge that some expenditures of the US government
<br>
don't appear in official budget statements, so I don't find it difficult to
<br>
believe the sources below that say aid to Israel has been even higher than
<br>
reflected in official reports.
<br>
<p>I've used several sources here to minimize error. I think I've used a fairly
<br>
comprehensive range of viewpoints, and they all seem to agree on the basic
<br>
point that Israel has always received aid from the US government.
<br>

<p>=======================
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/010201/0101015.html">http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/010201/0101015.html</a>
<br>
<p>Unquestionably, Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. aid since
<br>
World War II. Estimates for total U.S. aid to Israel vary, however, because
<br>
of the uncertainties and ambiguities described above. An Oct. 27, 2000
<br>
Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, using available and verifiable
<br>
numbers, gives cumulative aid to Israel from 1949 through FY 2000 (which
<br>
ended Sept. 30, 2000) at $81.38 billion. On the other hand, last year the
<br>
Washington Report on Middle East Affairs estimated total aid to Israel
<br>
through FY 2000 at $91.82 billion.
<br>
<p>The CRS number surely is too low, because, although it does include such
<br>
things as the old food-for-peace program, the $1.2 billion from the Wye
<br>
agreement, and the current subsidy for “refugee resettlement,” it does not
<br>
include money from the DOD budget, on the grounds that those funds are for
<br>
joint research and development projects. Nor does the CRS figure include
<br>
estimated interest on the early disbursement of aid funds. Last year’s
<br>
Washington Report estimate imputes an amount for “other aid” (including the
<br>
DOD) that may no longer be valid, based as it is on a thorough study of
<br>
three representative years. While this year’s estimate is more conservative,
<br>
the results are still shockingly high.
<br>
<p>To the CRS number of $81.38 billion through FY 2000 can be added (with
<br>
details to follow):
<br>
<p>• $4.28 billion from the DOD; and
<br>
<p>• $1.72 billion in interest from early disbursement of aid, for a total of
<br>
$87.38 billion through Sept. 30, 2000. To that can be added the $3.22
<br>
billion detailed above, giving a grand total of $90.6 billion total aid to
<br>
Israel through FY 2001. Approval of Clinton’s special request for $450
<br>
million more in military aid would push the number over $91 billion

<br>
<p>Unshakeable commitment to Israel’s security:  Despite the Oslo peace
<br>
process, Israel today faces severe existential threats, in addition to daily
<br>
security problems that affect the lives of every Israeli. The violent
<br>
Palestinian uprising, instability on Israel’s border with Lebanon as a
<br>
result of Hezbollah’s growing military presence, vocal threats by Iran and
<br>
Iraq, in addition to the very real dangers posed by their acquisition of
<br>
weapons of mass destruction, create a dangerous instability that could
<br>
easily lead to a rapidly escalating conflict. U.S. military assistance
<br>
provides Israel the wherewithal to meet these growing threats and
<br>
symbolizes, more than anything else, the unshakeable commitment the United
<br>
States has to Israel’s security.

<a href="http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/US-Israel/foreign_aid.html">http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/US-Israel/foreign_aid.html</a>
<br>
<p>Truman's commitment was quickly tested after Israel's victory in its War of
<br>
Independence when she applied to the U.S. for economic aid to help absorb
<br>
immigrants. President Truman responded by approving a $135 million
<br>
Export-Import Bank loan and the sale of surplus commodities to Israel. In
<br>
those early years of Israel's statehood (also today), U.S. aid was seen as a
<br>
means of promoting peace.
<br>
<p>In 1951, Congress voted to help Israel cope with the economic burdens
<br>
imposed by the influx of Jewish refugees from the displaced persons camps in
<br>
Europe and from the ghettos of the Arab countries. Arabs then complained the
<br>
U.S. was neglecting them, though they had no interest in or use for American
<br>
aid then. In 1951, Syria rejected offers of U.S. aid. Oil-rich Iraq and
<br>
Saudi Arabia did not need U.S. economic assistance, and Jordan was, until
<br>
the late 1950s, the ward of Great Britain. After 1957, when the United
<br>
States assumed responsibility for supporting Jordan and resumed economic aid
<br>
to Egypt, assistance to the Arab states soared. Also, the United States was
<br>
by far the biggest contributor of aid to the Palestinians through UNRWA, a
<br>
status that continues to the present.
<br>
<p>U.S. economic grants to Israel ended in 1959. U.S. aid to Israel from then
<br>
until 1985 consisted largely of loans, which Israel repaid, and surplus
<br>
commodities, which Israel bought. Israel began buying arms from the United
<br>
States in 1962, but did not receive any grant military assistance until
<br>
after the 1973 Yom Kippur War. As a result, Israel had to go deeply into
<br>
debt to finance its economic development and arms procurement. The decision
<br>
to convert military aid to grants that year was based on the prevailing view
<br>
in Congress that without a strong Israel, war in the Middle East was more
<br>
likely, and that the U.S. would face higher direct expenditures in such an
<br>
eventuality.
<br>
<p>Israel has received more direct aid from the United States since World War
<br>
II than any other country, but the amounts for the first half of this period
<br>
were relatively small. Between 1949 and 1973, the U.S. provided Israel with
<br>
an average of about $122 million a year, a total of $3.1 billion (and
<br>
actually more than $1 billion of that was loans for military equipment in
<br>
1971-73) . Prior to 1971, Israel received a total of only $277 million in
<br>
military aid, all in the form of loans as credit sales. The bulk of the
<br>
economic aid was also lent to Israel. By comparison, the Arab states
<br>
received nearly three times as much aid before 1971, $4.4 billion, or $170
<br>
million per year. Moreover, unlike Israel, which receives nearly all its aid
<br>
from the United States, Arab nations have gotten assistance from Asia,
<br>
Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and the European Community. Congress first
<br>
designated a specific amount of aid for Israel (an  &quot;earmark&quot;) in 1971.
<br>
<p>========================
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.hotpolitics.com/tax4israel.htm">http://www.hotpolitics.com/tax4israel.htm</a>
<br>
<p>The common argument that the United States gives Israel $3 billion per
<br>
year-$1.2 billion in economic aid and $1.8 billion in military aid-is
<br>
misleading. This figure is impressive enough, since it represents about
<br>
one-sixth of total U.S. foreign aid. Yet the true figure is even more
<br>
remarkable, with estimates ranging as high as $5.5 billion per year.
<br>
Calculating the exact amount of U.S. aid to Israel, however, is difficult.
<br>
One has to make estimates because much of the aid is buried in the budgets
<br>
of other government agencies, mostly the Department of Defense (DOD). Aid is
<br>
also allotted in a form that is not easily quantifiable, such as the early
<br>
disbursement of financial aid which allows Israel to gain (and the U.S.
<br>
taxpayer to lose) the interest on the funds that have not yet been spent.
<br>
<p>Aid to Israel from 1949 to 2001:
<br>
According to an October 27 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report,
<br>
cumulative aid to Israel from 1949 through fiscal year (FY) 2000 was $81.38
<br>
billion. This number is too low because it omits &quot;hidden&quot; funds. While it
<br>
includes the $1.2 billion promised to Israel in the Wye River Memorandum,
<br>
the old Food for Peace program, and the current subsidy for &quot;refugee
<br>
resettlement,&quot; it omits money from the DOD budget on the grounds that those
<br>
funds are for research and development projects that benefit both the United
<br>
States and Israel-a questionable premise. The CRS total also excludes
<br>
estimated interest on the early disbursement of aid.
<br>
<p>Building up from the amount listed in the CRS, I have included-with details
<br>
to follow-$4.28 billion from the DOD and $1.72 billion from interest accrued
<br>
due to early aid disbursement. This comes to a total of $87.38 billion
<br>
through September 30 of this year (the end of FY 2000). Add to this amount
<br>
the $3.98 billion for FY 2001: This number includes $840 million in economic
<br>
aid, $1.98 billion in military aid, $60 million for refugee resettlement,
<br>
$250 million from the DOD budget, and $85 million in interest. The resulting
<br>
grand total of the above calculations is $91.36 billion in aid to Israel
<br>
through FY 2001.
