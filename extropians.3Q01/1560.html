</em><br>
<p><p>I wasn't going to explain it in detail, but why not.  Inflatable decoys have
<br>
a number of bang-for-the-buck issues that make spherical decoys the obvious
<br>
choice.  Note that these days balloon decoys primarily serve to generate an
<br>
illusion for optical sensors.
<br>
<p>The reason spherical decoys work is that from many aspects, the cone shaped
<br>
warhead looks essentially identical to the spherical decoy to the optical
<br>
sensor.  Therefore, a sphere always takes on a theoretically valid profile
<br>
of a real warhead, thereby serving its purpose.
<br>
<p>A cone shaped decoy balloon *could* work, but there are a lot of practical
<br>
reasons why it doesn't.  The biggest reason is that it is difficult to make
<br>
a cone-shaped decoy balloon act like a real warhead on the sensors without
<br>
it becoming heavy and expensive.  A real warhead has a stable aspect with
<br>
respect to its trajectory.  With a cone-shaped decoy, a sensor can detect
<br>
any rotation of the decoy that is inconsistent with a real warhead because
<br>
the asymmetry of the shape makes it possible to do this optically.  Not so
<br>
with a sphere.  Since the balloons are released and then inflate while
<br>
floating freely, it would require the addition of an inertial guidance
<br>
package to the cone-shaped balloon to make sure that it was actually stably
<br>
oriented in the right direction to fool the sensors.
<br>
<p>Of course, if your sensor systems can discriminate between balloons and
<br>
warheads regardless of shape, then it doesn't really matter what you do with
<br>
the balloons.  This is frequently the case with current technology, so in
<br>
that respect the decoy WAS a dog and pony show for the most part.
<br>
<p>In any case, the decoy was largely irrelevant to the test.  The
<br>
discrimination and sensor technologies are well-proven and most are
<br>
deployed, at least in part, in other military systems.  The decoy was
<br>
probably added to make the test look spiffier than it was.  What they are
<br>
really testing is the physical engineering of the vehicle, as that is the
<br>
unproven part.
<br>
<p>I'm not a big cheerleader for SDI, but you are grossly mischaracterizing the
<br>
technology.  Let us at least keep that part of the discussion reasonably
<br>
grounded.
