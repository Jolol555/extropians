For some reason this failed the first time I sent it. I'll try again:
<br>
<p>===================================
<br>
Merriss quoted
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; If a strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and seemingly reasonable message is getting out in numerous local forums, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and in wider forums whenever one of us has the clout to be heard there, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this must have a gradual effect in countering the anti-life-extension.
</em><br>
<p><p>then said
<br>
<p><p>These things are true. But, are there local chapters
<br>
of Extropians? Are there other orgnizations like it?
<br>
If so, do they compete too much (a house divided and
<br>
all that)? Do you have a printed newsletter (my
<br>
graphic arts background is clamoring to be heard)? Do
<br>
we have anyone pestering drug companies and the
<br>
government besides Pearson and Shaw? I truly don't
<br>
know, and am not asking just to make a point or two.
<br>
<p><p>I'm not the person to answer these questions, being new to the list myself.
<br>
<p>However, I do know that it is possible for individuals to make an
<br>
incremental difference to such political debates. Moreover, there is some
<br>
virtue to different individuals putting slightly different positions rather
<br>
than a lot of carbon-copy activism.
<br>
<p>One line of attack is this. Democratic governments will seldom pass sweeping
<br>
new laws without some process of consultation with the public. Okay, so we
<br>
can make submissions.
<br>
<p>Here in Australia, a parliamentary committee was set up to look at the issue
<br>
of human cloning and it called for submissions. Lobby groups, research
<br>
organisations, and many individuals made submissions. They are listed
<br>
here...
<br>
<p><p><a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/laca/humancloning/Submiss.htm">http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/laca/humancloning/Submiss.htm</a>
<br>
<p><p>... and many of them can be downloaded. My own submission can be found there
<br>
at the top of the list, coz I was quick to get it in and they appear to be
<br>
in date order. It is downloadable.
<br>
<p>Now, my submission is a fairly simple one, and you may not agree with all,
<br>
or any of my analysis. However, a few points:
<br>
<p>(1) I have considerable professional experience in writing such submissions.
<br>
<p>(2) It is a sufficiently good model that I was later approached by one
<br>
(reputable)  university asking if I minded them using it as a model in a
<br>
course where students are introduced, among other things, to what is
<br>
involved in writing submissions to government on ethical issues, etc.
<br>
<p>(3) It seems to have had *some* impact on the minds of the committee members
<br>
in that, when I read the transcript of one of the two public hearings
<br>
conducted after submissions were received, some of the questions being asked
<br>
suggest that my analysis was at least being absorbed.
<br>
<p>None of this means it's a perfect submission or that it will ultimately have
<br>
any significant impact in itself. The relevant government committee has now
<br>
been stalled for a long time but is expected to produce a compromise report
<br>
in the next few weeks. Meanwhile, the Australian parliament passed a crude
<br>
anti-cloning law last year - it probably has the effect of banning only
<br>
reproductive cloning and it may even fail to do that, for technical reasons
<br>
that I won't bother you with.
<br>
<p>What I can say confidently is that it is possible for individuals to make
<br>
*some* impression on the public consultation process and that I have offered
<br>
you a reasonably good formal model of how a simple submission to government
<br>
can be structured. I haven't tried to work out how the issues relating to
<br>
other forms of research bans might be analysed, and some of the issues in
<br>
this case were purely local, in that we were all reacting to a particular
<br>
Australian report. But it would not be difficult for individuals to do their
<br>
own analysis of almost any issue along similar lines.
<br>
<p>In this process, it is better if individuals do their own analyses and final
<br>
formulations. Government officials pay scant regard to anything that looks
<br>
like multiple copies of a single, organised template. OTOH, a forum like
<br>
this certainly provides a resource for ideas and drafts.
<br>
<p>In addition, it is possible to get out material in the print media taking a
<br>
pro-technology position. I have written a number of articles of 4000 to 6000
<br>
words on such subjects in a prominent intellectual journal here. One of
<br>
these was on life extension - in homage to Karl Popper and Virginia Postrel,
<br>
I called it &quot;Life Extension and its Enemies&quot;. Last week, I posted some
<br>
fairly daunting material on the list, which was in answer to an anti-cloning
<br>
article I came across in _The Journal of Law and Medicine_. The material I
<br>
posted was a short extract, dealing with &quot;human dignity&quot;, from an 8500-word
<br>
philosophical article that I wrote in reply. My latest good news is that the
<br>
Journal has now accepted this for publication. All such activities help
<br>
break down the impression of an anti-technology consensus. Damien has
<br>
managed to get material published here in places with much larger audiences
<br>
than any of these.
<br>
<p>The moral is that if we are all doing these sorts of things (and there are
<br>
apparently over 300 of us on this list) it will have a significant overall
<br>
impact. We *do* need to sound reasonable and fairly likeable, bracketing off
<br>
issues as we go so as not to create unnecessary side issues. Of course, I
<br>
can't expect literally all 300+ of us to do all this. Not all of us have
<br>
professional writing skills; conversely, many of us doubtless have other
<br>
creative talents and skills that could be deployed against the
<br>
irrationalists and luddites. Or we may be able to persuade others with
<br>
skills and clout to be active in this cause.
<br>
<p>I am happy to mail any of my material to any individuals who may wish to use
<br>
it as a resource, with appropriate attribution if it is quoted or relied on
<br>
in close detail.
<br>
<p>And, all that said, I'm not suggesting that other people are on the list are
<br>
not doing these things already. Many of us are, no doubt, and if so it's not
<br>
up to me to teach you how to suck eggs. I am, however, happy to share
<br>
resources and ideas.
<br>
<p>I'll think separately about Reason's proposals and reply to them later.
<br>
<p>Ascend!
<br>

<br>
<p>=====================
<br>
<p>PS If anyone goes to the site I posted, have a look at Professor Julian 
<br>
Savulescu's submission, number 254 on the list. I recommend this *highly* as 
<br>
a resource for those interested in stem cell research etc.
