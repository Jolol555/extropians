</em><br>
<p>To tell you the truth, I don't understand your question.  When was dinging a
<br>
worthwhile practice, and why would it make extropians endearing?  (I plead
<br>
ignorance about something it seems I should &quot;get&quot; here, but I don't.  I
<br>
confess I'm at a total loss with this question ...)
<br>
<p>I did conclude, after reading about dinging dinging, being dinged,
<br>
dingees, dingers, compulsive dingers and compulsive dingees, dedinging
<br>
yourself, having regular
<br>
dedinging sessions, and many phrases on the order of, &quot;[h]e seemed to live
<br>
in a world full of dingers determined to ding him at every opportunity,&quot; and
<br>
[a]bandoning external control psychology and adopting Choice Theory [going]
<br>
a long way toward eliminating dinging,&quot; that it made me less than
<br>
endearing - in fact, it made me cranky.  And I'm sorry about that - I
<br>
apologize for being insensitive.  To read several thousand words that
<br>
essentially boiled down to, &quot;we should all attempt to follow the Golden
<br>
Rule&quot;; &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;; don't forget to say &quot;thank you&quot;; and &quot;I'm
<br>
okay because I've got the power ... AND YOU CAN'T HURT ME,&quot; seemed
<br>
unnecessary.   I clicked onto the &quot;slavespeak&quot; article, too, and understood
<br>
it essentially to mean, &quot;We all have put our pants on one leg at a time,&quot;
<br>
but, again, &quot;millions and millions&quot; of words seemed unnecessary to point
<br>
this out.
<br>
<p>It's probably just me.  I'm a big booster myself (speaking of Big Booster)
<br>
of plain English, and while I know some disciplines cannot limit themselves
<br>
to just plain English, I believe psychology, insurance, politics, management
<br>
theory, law, to name a few (and those damned instruction manuals - you know
<br>
which they are!) - all could use an overhaul into plain English.
<br>
<p>I'm a &quot;ding&quot;bat (what else can I say?),
<br>
Olga
