<P>In the area of technology and science the one big thing linking the two to the literary world is SF. In SF you've got the great battle of subjectivity and objectivity - the fact of science and the fiction of literature. Now perhaps this is where Hayles finds her problem - she looks for the posthuman in literature and science and has a hard time concretising her theories.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Perhaps&nbsp;another problem is found in the contradictions of postmodern thought. The postmodernists seems to&nbsp;be grounded in subjectivity - the idea that there is no reality bar that which the person sees - hence their love of cyberspace.&nbsp;They love the idea of fractured and multiple identities and the idea of simulcra. Now these seem to go against many of the&nbsp;positivistic beleifs found in science in the last hundred years, it argues agianst rationalism, reason,&nbsp;objective fact and empirical proof. Whether postmodernism can ever be allied with science is something I'm unsure of - perhaps the technology of VR and cyberspace is the only way. The postmodernists are right at home here, and so it seems, are many of the&nbsp;extropians. Perhaps this is were the bridge will be&nbsp;made?</P>
<P>Any thoughts.....perhaps I'm way out of my league here, but at the very least it helps to keep my brain ticking over so it doesn't become reminscent of mush!</P>
