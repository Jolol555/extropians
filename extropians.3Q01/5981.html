<p>Unfortunately, I have the impression that the majority is not Getting It,
<br>
and, further, has not interest in Starting Getting It. Geek activism as
<br>
e.g. demonstrated in the DMCA/Sklyarov case thus must necessarily remain a
<br>
flash in the pan.
<br>
<p>There is no political basis for such activism. Ask around; I did in the
<br>
last days. I very much discourage coders and potential coders and
<br>
architects to join the rallies, but rather focus forces on their core area
<br>
of expertise: creating the infrastructure which will be extremely
<br>
difficult to screen for, censor and block. If the political activists will
<br>
be successful, there's no need in this. However, if they are not, it is
<br>
impossible to establish such an infrastructure overnight, especially under
<br>
draconic persecution and a witch hunt atmosphere. Hence, please allocate
<br>
your priorities according to your skill set.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; political action and protests.  Some of us are old enough to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grown up in the Vietnam era and we learned a bit about these things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We who are of the aging baby boomer generation need to learn to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protest and to demonstrate all over again side by side with our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; younger counterparts. We need to learn how to do it smarter than we
</em><br>
<p>The age histogram shifts, and you will find many of the younger to be
<br>
preoccupied with other things, and hence largely unresponsive. As I said,
<br>
there is no political basis, nor is there an easy way to establish such. I
<br>
might be wrong, but there's little lost if I'm proven wrong, but plenty in
<br>
the opposite case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; did back then and smarter than a lot of the protests of today.  But we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need just as much dedication and passion and just as much of a counter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture identity as in the sixties and seventies.  And all of us,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of our ages, need to make our voices heard, heard now and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard LOUD. We need to become revolutionaries and to teach the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what this revolution is about, what we all stand to gain or lose, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to fight for it.  We need first to recognize it and dedicate to it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves.  Or are we going to simply whine and dream up some gee-whiz
</em><br>
<em>&gt; garage &quot;technological solution&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Hey, the microcomputer revolution started out as garage operations. And
<br>
software piggybacking on existing infrastructure is a &quot;technological
<br>
solution&quot; that is mostly working, already. Just please start using the
<br>
darn things, okay?
<br>
<p>I consider it is rather pathetic that there is no visible use of
<br>
cryptography and steganography amongst the Extropian and Transhumanist
<br>
communities, that there is not even a web of trust, and that open source
<br>
solutions are considered suspicious. I think this totally blows any claims
<br>
to technological leadership.&lt;/flame&gt;
<br>
<p>I strongy suggest a key generation and mutual signing session during the
<br>
next Extro conference. Similiar, ExI should publish an official statement
<br>
on current trends in IP. A thread of discussions should be allocated to
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is easier to stop the State from going totalitarian in disasterous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways while you still have enough rights to organize and protest than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is to survive and manage to sneak by it once it has done so.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may think you are smart enough to escape or to to work around it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But how much pain, lost years and lost lives might you avoid if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used that wonderful brain to organize, oppose and protest now or at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least support those who do?
</em><br>
<p>Organisation skills are not coding skills. If you have political skills
<br>
and connections, use them. If not, put your other talents to good use.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what will it take?  Memetic engineering yes.  But also more active
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff that gives notice right now that we will not stand for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonsense comming in SSSCA.  We must go viral and flood the congress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critters with mail and phone calls and infect everyone we can with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importance of doing likewise.  We need marches and demonstrations in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Washington and throughout the country as soon as we can organize them.
</em><br>
<p>I don't expect SSSCA to pass. At least not at first. But, I would be
<br>
surprised not to see SSSCA implemented in spirit if not letter in most
<br>
industrialized countries.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We needed them already for DMCA and its early victims but it is better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; late than never.  We need lawyers and legal entanglements for bringing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the IP police state policies down.  We need legal protests and test
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases, editorials, letter to editors.  We need teach-ins. Can we reach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a broad enough coalition to force the politicians to take notice?  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know.  But we must try in all ways that make sense to try.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We must start asap.  Preferably the protests should begin even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before this gross legislative miscarriage is even officially a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bill before Congress.
</em><br>
<p>Good luck.
