<p>It sure made Extro4 more memorable.  {8^D

</em><br>
<p>This one Im sure of.
<br>
<p>The swimming statue of liberty would not happen in a greenhouse situation,
<br>
since there is no reason why they would leave the statue in place if the seas
<br>
start to rise.  Even the most wild-eyed greenhouse theorist would
<br>
estimate the sea rise would take a few thousand years.  How long
<br>
would it take to disassemble and move the statue of liberty?  5 years?
<br>
<p>Secondly, it is made of copper, so how long would that survive in
<br>
seawater?  10 years?  The A.I movie had buildings toppling for some strange
<br>
reason, but the statue of liberty survived to be submerged?  Absurd.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, when I first heard of the scenario of an 80 meter rise in
<br>
the sea, (around 1970, about 4th grade) my question was &quot;How
<br>
long would the transition take?&quot;  They fumbled around for
<br>
a while then admitted it would take a long time, at least thousands of
<br>
years.  My attitude then is pretty close to what it is now: why is that
<br>
such a problem?  We can build new cities inland.  Hell, New York
<br>
City is only 300 years old.  The new cities would be a lot better
<br>
than the old ones.  Sure, we would lose some major tracts of land,
<br>
Holland, Venice, Florida, etc, but the transition would be slow enough
<br>
that humans would scarcely notice.  Sure we would lose historical
<br>
information, but in a runaway greenhouse earth, we would gain a
<br>
bunch of new land that is currently nearly useless.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, if we thought it over, there are ways of storing water
<br>
inland on Antarctica, even in a runaway greenhouse scenario.  Also
<br>
we could cool the earth if necessary by artificially increasing the planet's
<br>
albedo, again with plenty of time to react.
<br>
<p>If the greenhouse transition is over thousands of years, it
<br>
all seems irrelevant, for our terraforming technology will long be in
<br>
place before we lowlanders start needing to swim.
<br>
<p>Movie scenes of a drowning statue of liberty are memorable but
<br>
place incorrect and harmful memes in the minds of the masses. spike
