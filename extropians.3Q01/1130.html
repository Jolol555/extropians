Samantha writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To me spirituality is about the apprehension and the actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creation of the deepest and most truly glorious potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible.
</em><br>
<p>A lot of confusion has arisen over nothing if this is all
<br>
that you and others mean when defending spirituality.
<br>
<p>Samantha had also written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Religions are great tools for weaving visions.  For good and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ill.  They are also quite good for cohering societies devoted at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; different levels to common goals.  And I believe some of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; systems have quite a lot to say about letting go of your current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; mental/emotional lockstep and redefining and reintegrating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; yourself.  This is a very important skill for what most of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; contemplate doing and becoming.
</em><br>
<p>and Eliezer responded
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Again, I use rationality for that.
</em><br>
<p>to which Samantha replies
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You use rationality and again, something that you include in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality that is beyond what I think many mean by the term.  
</em><br>
<p>I think that this is true.  Most people here, I believe, who are
<br>
the great exponents of rationality would probably speak like
<br>
this:  &quot;it is rational, and rationally advances your goals, to
<br>
redefine and reintegrate yourself, but the values that lie
<br>
behind the act aren't neccessarily rational or irrational---
<br>
they just are.&quot;   That is, most of us still believe in the 
<br>
is/ought barrier.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I disagree that saying there is something deeper than reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself is solely to protect wrong thinking.  There are simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; places in the fabric of truth and of deep value that cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reached by reason alone.
</em><br>
<p>About &quot;deep value&quot; I agree.  But it might be helpful to the
<br>
whole debate if you gave some examples of places in the
<br>
fabric of truth that cannot be reached by reason.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Scientists are not the only source of healthy and necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discomfort.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely true.
<br>
