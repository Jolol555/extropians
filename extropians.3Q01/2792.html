<p>
(See press release below)
<br>
<p>I've known Ed Wright for a few years now, and he's been threatening to
<br>
start a rocket racing association since 1999.  We've leased the EZrocket
<br>
to X-Rocket (pity the names are so similar) for the 2002 season, not so
<br>
much to raise revenue to XCOR but mostly to raise the public
<br>
conciousness, build investor confidence, and gain experience.  If
<br>
multiple teams emerge in the next year or two, XCOR would of course be
<br>
happy to sell propulsion systems and safety training to all of them...
<br>
<p>Ed's goal of 100,000 feet for the drag race might be a bit too much in
<br>
the first season, but I can see 10 kft, 20 kft, 40 kft, and 100 kft in
<br>
succeeding seasons.  It's a sexy idea.
<br>
<p>Have I mentioned lately that I love my job?  (I'd better, it's ruined my
<br>
social life.)

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<p>Rocketship Will Tour Airshow Circuit in 2002
<p>Oshkosh, WI ‹ (July 28, 2001) ‹ X-Rocket, LLC announced today that the
world¹s first rocketship act is now available for airshow booking and
sponsorship. &quot;The XCOR EZ-Rocket will tour the airshow circuit during
2002,
giving millions of Americans their first chance to see a fully reusable,
piloted rocketship in action,&quot; said X-Rocket president Edward Wright.
&quot;X-Rocket is proud to bring this act to the American public during the
2002
airshow season.&quot; 
<p>The EZ-Rocket, built by Mojave, CA-based XCOR Aerospace, made its first
test
flight on July 21, 2001, under the command of test pilot Dick Rutan.
Rutan,
who won aviation¹s highest honors by piloting the Voyager on its
historic
round-the-world flight in 1986, said the EZ-Rocket performed smoothly
and the
first test flight was a resounding success. Flight testing will continue
when the rocketship returns to Mojave from Oshkosh, WI, where it is
currently on static display at one of the nation¹s largest airshows,
AirVenture 2001. 
<p>Speaking at an AirVenture press conference, Wright congratulated Dick
Rutan
and XCOR Aerospace on their accomplishment. &quot;X-Rocket is proud to have
contributed to this project, and we are pleased to see our investment
begin
to pay off.&quot; 
<p>Wright said that a number of major airshows have already indicated their
interest in presenting a rocketship act. Wright urged interested shows
and
businesses to contact X-Rocket as soon as possible. &quot;We provide one-stop
shopping for all your EZ-Rocket performance, sponsorship, and
merchandise
needs.&quot; 
<p>X-Rocket, LLC believes that rocket racing can become a major driver for
the
development of reusable rocket technology and sees the XCOR EZ-Rocket as
the
first step toward that goal. &quot;Prior to World War II, air racing was the
major driver for the development of aviation technology,&quot; Wright said.
<p>X-Rocket would like to see rocket racing beginning with a vertical drag
race
to 100,000 feet. &quot;The 100,000-foot time to climb record has been held by
a
Russian MiG-25 variant since the 1970¹s,&quot; Wright said. &quot;We think it¹s
time
to bring that record home to the United States. The XCOR EZ-Rocket is
the
first step toward the development of such racers- racers which, in turn,
will
develop the technology that enables a new era of routine, affordable
space
travel for science, business, and personal leisure.&quot;
