<em>&gt; Wow... a genuine conspiracy.  So why didn't you take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal action? Or did you?  If so, what were the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; findings?
</em><br>
<p>Its even better: my family pediatrician who knew of this asthmatic
<br>
reaction called up their medical people and exposed the rig. They said,
<br>
&quot;fine, do the test without the inhalation.&quot; So we did, and I passed with
<br>
flying colors, and we submitted the results, whereupon they replied,&quot;Oh
<br>
great you are OK, but we finished appointing the class this year, why
<br>
don't you try again next year?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b) lost out on financial aid in college, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; biased to provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more aid to people of the same economic level if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they were minorities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Did you get your education anyway... despite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; losing
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; some of those black students might not have gotten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; their educations at all if they had lost out?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My parents had to pay full boat for my education,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which I did not and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could not afford to finish due to the expenses of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; back injury. With
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; three other siblings, they could only afford to send
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me for a year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unless I obtained financial aid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That wasn't a yes or no.  Do you have a college degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not?
</em><br>
<p>I did not finish my college degree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have 5 other siblings.  I also have an AA degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which I paid for myself, no financial aid or help from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my parents and one of my brothers has an BS in EE,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also paid for by himself.
</em><br>
<p>I suppose I could have moved elsewhere in the country from New England
<br>
(even public colleges charge $5k+ in tuition here). Oh, yeah, I did
<br>
that, and got defrauded of my GI Bill benefits when I went back to
<br>
school after leaving the Air Force. I was working three minimum wage
<br>
jobs at the time while going to school, with my wages barely paying my
<br>
rent and minimal food in Seattle, and certainly couldn't afford to go to
<br>
school otherwise, and the state wouldn't offer financial assistance to
<br>
an able bodied white male. I looked at doing the electricians
<br>
apprenticeship program, since I had been an electrician for three years
<br>
in the Air Force, but they didn't offer any advanced placement for prior
<br>
experience and only paid $7/hr to apprentices for the two years of the
<br>
program.
<br>
<p>Then I got a chance to start a business with two other fellows,
<br>
designing and developing new energy efficient lighting products, and
<br>
said to myself,&quot;Hmmm.... slave away at little pay or make decent money
<br>
doing what I like to do? Well.... DUH.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c) am constantly accused of being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; racist/sexist/'rich elite' simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because I am a white male.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think it's simply because you are a white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; male... But more because you say things like &quot;am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; constantly accused of being a racist/sexist/'rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; elite' simply because I am a white male.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Like I said, I was a white male... and I never got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; accused of being racist (or sexist, for that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; matter).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you are constantly being accused of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; racist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; maybe you should take a look at your words and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; actions.  It isn't just because you are a white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; male.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Irrespective of my words and actions, which anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; objective enough on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this list would understand are not racist, sexist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and I have certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; never been part of the 'rich elite'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But accusations of racism and sexism are based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words and actions (rich elite was thrown in by you...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; red herring).  Even if you feel your words and actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't racist or sexist, some people DO feel they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are... because as you say you are being constantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accused.
</em><br>
<p>I suppose 'constantly' is a bit of an overstatement, except in relation
<br>
to the liberals on this list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People seem to be objective enough to recognize that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am neither racist or sexist, why do you think they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't be objective when dealing with you?
</em><br>
<p>Because people of a liberal bent automatically assume that a fellow who
<br>
is adamantly pro gun rights and individual liberty must be an ignorant
<br>
red-necked neo-nazi KKK skinhead Aryan Nations nut-job, because they are
<br>
so blinded by their own hoplophobia and/or citified left wing
<br>
programming, as we have seen so evidently here on this list recently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, the only lack of opportunity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blacks I've known have had has been produced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their own memetic programming, and not by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the system. When you are programmed to expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; racism, that is exactly what you will get.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Racism is caused by the people being discriminated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; against, simply becuase they believe it exists?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You didn't really just say that, did you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No, that is NOT what I said, so stop putting words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in my mouth like you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; folks usually do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;When you are programmed to expect racism, that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly what you will get&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seems pretty clear to me.  Expectations of racism, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the part of the victims, is the cause of racism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In what way is my restatement wrong?
</em><br>
<p>Because you made a logical fallacy to assume that the perceptions of
<br>
some explain the actions of all. My statement was merely illustrating
<br>
that a person who is programmed to distrust and expect hostility
<br>
generally acts in such a way that they generate that sort of behavior in
<br>
people, regardless of whether there is similar behavior toward others
<br>
that is completely unprovoked.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have met my share of bigots.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I said this before, let me say it again... I DO NOT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think you would ever consciously commit a racist act.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I DO think you make unintentionally racist remarks.
</em><br>
<p>That is a possibility. It is also possible that I've generally become so
<br>
tired of dealing with the ignorance and prejudices of liberals (who
<br>
refuse to acknowledge that they are in fact ignorant and prejudiced)
<br>
toward myself and my opinions and that which I hold dear that I frankly
<br>
don't give a damn.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike... I have no trouble at all believing you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; good person who would never engage in overt acts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; discrimination... but you have deluded yourself if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; think that blacks bring it all on themselves...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is statements like that which result in you being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; called racist... it has nothing to do with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; color
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of your skin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; When I was in basic training, every black fellow who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dropped out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; training did so claiming 'racism', despite our three
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; DI's being black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and hispanic and female, respectively. Those fellows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who stuck with it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; laughed at such insinuations as cop outs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm... and yet I know many white males who worked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their way through school, receiving their education by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own efforts rather than using grants or their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents and didn't complain about AA being reverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discrimination.  In fact they laugh at the idea.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strikes them as a cop out.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. But frankly, unless those individuals are working as strippers or
<br>
gigolos, or have some 'in' someplace to make a decent living, they are
<br>
either on financial aid of some sort, or have a sugar daddy. It is
<br>
impossible for a person without an education to get one without some
<br>
sort of assistance from some quarter. By specifically excepting white
<br>
males from the system of financial aid, racism against white males is
<br>
institutionalized.
<br>
<p>Moreover, I NEVER said that racism alone prevented me from getting an
<br>
education. I broke my back in a skiing accident, which, because my
<br>
mother never notified the insurance company I was still on the family
<br>
insurance after turning 18, was not covered by insurance, thus I had to
<br>
drop out of WPI. Later when I left the USAF, I was defrauded of my GI
<br>
Bill benefits, which had nothing to do with racism.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A large amount of the poor opinion of blacks that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have seen in whites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is that far too many blacks live down to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stereotypes that whites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have, and thereby hurt all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A lot of the poor opinion of whites that I have seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in blacks is due to far too many whites engaging in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual discrimination, some subtle, some not so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtle.  Some intentional, some unintentional.
</em><br>
<p>You must accept the fact that unintentional discrimination will happen,
<br>
and is comitted by EVERYONE, white or black. Blacks get a pass on being
<br>
racist by the liberals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I do not say that discrimination against blacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doesn't exist. I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fought against it myself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good.  Now maybe fight it IN yourself.
</em><br>
<p>There is none in myself that is not present in everyone else. Mine is
<br>
illuminated because I am specifically a white male, I am part of the
<br>
only segment of the population that is not allowed to even
<br>
unintentionally have discriminatory behavior or opinions, while
<br>
discriminatory behavior by women and minorities is celebrated as
<br>
'diversity'.
