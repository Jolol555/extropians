Christian quoted Charlie
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Let me go further: the FASTEST way to build public support for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; draconian legislation of this type in the UK would be to somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; link DRM circumvention tools to handguns in the public mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I agree completely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We should keep in mind: the extreme position of the politicians
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against cloning has mainly one reason: a book called &quot;Brave New World&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No politician can afford to be associatad with a negative utopia. More
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concretely: no politican can afford to be associated with something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which is FEARED.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, exactly.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It does not matter whether it is well found or not.
</em><br>
<p>Quite so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Therefore, I think the best way to get support against this legislation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;associate it with Orwells 1984.
</em><br>
<p>Well yes. Good point.
<br>
<p>Now please someone actually dissect the proposed legislation for us so we
<br>
can appreciate its *precise* effects (and intentions). I may be the only one
<br>
here whose impression is very
<br>
blurred at the moment, but humour me. If I understand an issue properly and
<br>
can be convinced that it is a priority, I will do my little bit of activism.
<br>
<p>I realise I could research it for myself but I have a lot of
<br>
other projects on the go at the moment, and part of the reason for being on
<br>
this list is to
<br>
save some duplication of effort.
<br>
