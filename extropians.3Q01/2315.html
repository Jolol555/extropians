<p>Yes. But I think it is a fallacy that we all need to move in the same
<br>
direction or that consensus is always the best thing. If we can instead set
<br>
up things so that people largely can pursue their projects - regardless of
<br>
how wrong they might be - we will get both freedom, diversity and more
<br>
tested solutions. Sure, there will be people getting into serious trouble
<br>
by following erroneous or misguided ideas, but that will at least help
<br>
others to learn.  This will of course not solve all problems, since some
<br>
views are truly incompatible and adherents to them *have to* stop people of
<br>
other views, but creating institutions and legal structures enabling
<br>
competing ideas to exist in parallel with as little friction as possible is
<br>
still going to be very beneficial. Getting everybody just to try out a
<br>
single expert-devised solution is often going to be suboptimal compared to
<br>
exploiting the parallel creative power of diversity, not to mention has all
<br>
the risks of coercion and politicking for getting one's own favorite idea
<br>
declared as the true one.
