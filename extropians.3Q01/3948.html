<br>
<p>Eric, if you go back and dig through the archives, you will find
<br>
a message from me about how a MEMS probe (or eventually a nano-probe)
<br>
could be used to colonize near Earth asteroids and turn them into
<br>
powered rockets to be delivered to high altitude orbits.  Further
<br>
it discusses exponentially growing this effort and a role the
<br>
space station could play in actually doing some &quot;real work&quot;.
<br>
(The Javien search engine might be better at finding the message
<br>
than the Lucifer engine but I'm unsure).
<br>
<p>You *could* start work on it *today* using computer aided design
<br>
of such a probe.  Once designed, something that small doesn't
<br>
cost much to manufacture and I'm sure you could get one of
<br>
the public space societies to launch it.  It isn't a small
<br>
undertaking though.  You would need a core group of good
<br>
engineers that really wanted to work on it.  Spike or Doug
<br>
might be able to comment on how many are needed but I'd
<br>
guess perhaps 50-100 people.
<br>
<p>You may have also missed the discussions on why interstellar
<br>
colonization is a stupid idea (though opinion is divided on
<br>
this).  You are trying to apply anthropocentric views of
<br>
travel, colonization, property ownership, etc. without taking
<br>
into account the self-evolution that will occur once robust
<br>
nanotechnology is developed.  You are not taking into account
<br>
the high costs and diminished value (due to time 'aging')
<br>
of information transmitted over light-year distances or
<br>
the very high costs of navigating solar systems.  I do agree
<br>
with your comments that claiming space resources is a
<br>
valuable strategy for individuals to pursue (within a
<br>
solar system) but believe that as we go through the
<br>
singularity, individuals will develop approaches for creating
<br>
trust relationships and guaranteeing one another's security
<br>
that eliminate the need for wars and weapons.  If you go way
<br>
back in the archives you will also find discussions about
<br>
why &quot;berzerker bots&quot; make aggressive acts a very risky strategy.
<br>
<p>You and others having this discussion should read my papers
<br>
on planetary dismantlement and Matrioshka Brains as well
<br>
as some of the large body of referenced material.
