</em><br>
<p>True. I think the virus part might be too complex to have in the main
<br>
argument. 
<br>
<p>But didn't some forms of antibiotics resistance develop in hospitals rather
<br>
than due to agribusiness? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What they are is, by definition, *bacteria resistant to a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antibiotic*, or perhaps a family of similar antibiotics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That means that their evolution, at worst, has reverted the balance of play
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the way it was originally.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and this is worth stressing. And as you point out, the advances in
<br>
genomics, proteomics and similar areas increase the rate new methods of
<br>
dealing with them can be invented as well as totally new approaches
<br>
(ranging from bacteriophages to antisense DNA).  The solution to bacteria
<br>
developing resistance is continous change and development, something I
<br>
guess enemies of progress conveniently forget.
<br>
<p>The only thing that is far slower these days than before antibiotics is
<br>
getting the new drugs approved. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; *Except* that, in the meantime, monocultural agribiz has reduced the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic diversity of crops, making widespread variants especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vulnerable to the rebound diseases. That's not the fault of antibiotics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *per se*, though. It might be a very good reason to worry about excessively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; centralized and massively advertised corporate food production.
</em><br>
<p>True. It also seems that there might be benefits in more niched markets in
<br>
order to encourage diversity. Once we are rich enough, benefits of scale in
<br>
food production may be less worth than the subjective benefits of
<br>
specialisation.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; My feeling is that one needs to be very careful in describing the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem(s), and allocating blame. As far as I can see, *nobody* has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harmed by applying antibiotics to ill humans. I and many others are now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alive because of them. If we now face, at worst, reversion to a condition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where resistant bacterial diseases roam the world unchecked, that's very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sad--not because of the brief, blessed epoch of cheap, effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antibiotics, but because it's at an end. 
</em><br>
<p>Good point. 
<br>
<p>I liked your metaphor in the other post of plucking the easy low-hanging
<br>
antibiotics fruits from the tree; it might be worth pointing out that we
<br>
can not just pick high-hanging fruit but also make the tree grow new
<br>
fruits.
