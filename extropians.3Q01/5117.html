<p>Me too, but your shelters would be of no use in such an attack.

</em><br>
<p>Actually they did an aerosol deployment of anthrax spores around
<br>
the parliment building, I think you're refering to the Sarin
<br>
attack. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;They could have achieved two orders of magnitude more victims

</em><br>
<em>&gt;it out there alive.
</em><br>
<p>I believe you're refering to their Sarin attack on the subway,
<br>
rather than anthrax.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, I'm not willing the take the risk rogue nations are that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stupid. Besides, I'm not sure it makes sense to differentiate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rogue nations from terrorists, because a dictator has far too much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to lose than an anonymous group that is not in control.
</em><br>
<p>I was only refering to the resources a dictator has versus the
<br>
basement labs of your average terrorist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Very well, I've stated a number of times that the umbrella will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cause other superpowers to increase their arsenal, and modify that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arsenal, resulting in more more difficult to intercept nukes. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is not a neutral side effect, and needs to be taken into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;calculation. Even if you're not directly protecting yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against other superpowers.
</em><br>
<p>China is going to increase it's arsenal regardless, smaller nations
<br>
won't have the resources.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I very much hope that my attack will remain theoretical. And you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seem not to understand that you're thinking rationally, but no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rational person will nuke you. These is not the folks you have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be wary of.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, that's what goobvarmint is for, to create regulations that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;every new built house needs to have a shelter of an approved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;design. These are incremental costs, and as a side effect you get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shelters with very short average distances, so that you can react
</em><br>
<em>&gt;within a few minutes forewarning.
</em><br>
<p>No U.S. government is going to do this, by the way this is the ICBM
<br>
scenario. ;)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Small portable devices will be weak, dirty fission, maybe boosted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fission. State of the art nuclear devices should not be on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;free market. Rogue states don't do fusion, for the same reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they don't do ICBMs. Good physicists and technicians are a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scarcer and much less expendable than fanatics.
</em><br>
<p>Let me try to restate our positions.
<br>
<p>In the event of an ICBM attack you think shelters are more
<br>
effective/ less expensive while I think that ABM's are the better
<br>
choice. (actually I'd like both but can't afford it).
<br>
<p>You think a suitcase nuke or megatruck bomb is more likely, but in
<br>
this case I think shelters are useless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Since shelters are distributed (well, they have be, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;otherwise the mean average distance would be too long), and he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would have to detonate his weak nuke underground, the amounts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;survivors would be maximum in this case. If you have limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resources, you go for an airburst, which will profit from the nuke
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being dirty, if not salted. Much nastier than a high flux, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they won't get, anyway.
</em><br>
<p>In a non-ICBM attack there is no warning so shelters are
<br>
ineffective.
