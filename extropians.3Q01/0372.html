</em><br>
<p>Why would you need to destroy the original?
<br>
<p>There are scanning techniques that can resolve down to individual neurons 
<br>
in insects non-destructively now. They require pretty intense magnetic 
<br>
fields and only work on small things so far, but I imagine scaling it up is 
<br>
not an insoluble problem. We would also need to scan at a fair bit below 
<br>
the level of detail of neurons so that you make out receptor sites and 
<br>
synaptic vesicles. That may be enough to automate recording of a human 
<br>
brain so that a model of its operation could be accurately be recreated.
<br>
<p>This way you could have a copy of yourself made so as insurance against a 
<br>
calamity. You would periodically &quot;backup&quot; your brain to record all the more 
<br>
recent memories and thought patterns, and choose at which model contains 
<br>
the happiest and healthiest version of yourself to be used as your final 
<br>
self upon biological death.
<br>
<p>The model would operate inside a computer (likely not the kind of computer 
<br>
we have at the moment), and would play inside virtual worlds. There would 
<br>
be windows out onto the &quot;real&quot; world too.
<br>
<p>I like very much the idea that I could keep a backup version of myself 
<br>
without endangering my biological self in the process. I hope it is not too 
<br>
far away. I figure maybe 20 years from now...
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
