<p>BIOLOGY
<br>
<p>UNEXPECTED SIGNALS WITHIN LIFE FORMS
<br>
<p>Multicellular organisms are information networks.  They have to be because
<br>
life is conferred by the flow of information.  We all learn how the nervous
<br>
system carries a heavy traffic of electrical signals, but we hear less
<br>
about chemical signals, and they are more important.  Chemical signalling
<br>
molecules help cells learn what is going on around them so that they can
<br>
make decisions concerning metabolism, division, and even whether to die
<br>
not not [or not die].  This is mainstream biochemistry, although there is
<br>
much here yet to be learned.  A signalling medium that *still* survives
<br>
well off the mainstream is the old idea that information is carried from
<br>
cell to cell via electromagnetic radiation.
<br>
<p>Yes, we mean *mitogenetic* radiation--the infamous M-rays of the 1920s and
<br>
1930s.  During this period about a thousand technical papers were published
<br>
on mitogenetic radiation---mostly in Russian.  The champion of mitogenetic
<br>
radiation was A.G. Gurwitsch.  He claimed that fundamental biological
<br>
functions, such as cell division, were communicated via ultraviolet light.
<br>
Although a few other researchers said they detected mitogenetic radiation,
<br>
most could not replicate Gurwitsch's work.  Mitogentic radiation was
<br>
thereafter subjected to the &quot;cold-fusion&quot; treatment; it was one of those
<br>
things that &quot;wasn't so&quot;!
<br>
<p>In a recent article in the *Journal of Scientific Exploration*, R. Van Wijk
<br>
tries to reignite interest in &quot;bio-photons&quot; that carry &quot;bio-information.&quot;
<br>
First, he assures us that mitogenetic radiation *is* real, that bio-photons
<br>
truly exist.  To thus swim against the scientific mainstream, he reviews
<br>
recent experiments and provides us with a huge bibliography.  Apparently,
<br>
mitogenetic radiation is not &quot;pathological science,&quot; as physicist I.
<br>
Langmuir called it back in 1953.  Second, Van Wijk advances some
<br>
mechanisms by which cells can generate bio-photons via their metabolic
<br>
and enzymatic processes.  Finally, he comes to the crux of the matter:
<br>
Do bio-photons really transmit information to neighboring cells and
<br>
thereby affect their functions?  Bolstering his claims, Van Wijk cites
<br>
confirming modern experiments with seeds, neotrophil cells, dinoflagellates,
<br>
and fireflies.  (Fireflies employ bio-photons internally in addition to
<br>
their external flashes.)
<br>
<p>(Van Wijk, R.; &quot;Bio-Photons and Bio-Communication,&quot; *Journal of Scientific
<br>
Exploration*, 15:183, 2001.)
<br>
<p>Comments.  Most of Van Wijk's references are European.  He was apparently
<br>
unaware of V.B. Shirley's positive review of the subject in a 1990 issue
<br>
of *Physics Today*.  (See SF#73 for our digest.)  For a mainstream review
<br>
of the complexities of intercell chemical signalling, see: Downard,
<br>
Julian; &quot;The Ins and Outs of Signalling,&quot; *Nature*, 411:759, 2001.
