<p>Yes. How about &quot;a racist is someone who believes in the inherent
<br>
superiority of one's own race over others outside of merely social or
<br>
cultural phenomena, and/or is dependent on the belief that there are
<br>
genetic differences between races that cause those phenomena&quot;. A racist
<br>
may or may not act on that opinion, that merely determines whether the
<br>
racist is polite or not. My definition does exclude social phenomena,
<br>
like the trust issues I've been illustrating, which are not genetically
<br>
based, so far as I can tell.
