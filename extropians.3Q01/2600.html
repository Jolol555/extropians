<p>I have committed no crime egregious or otherwise against anyone,

including americans of recent African decent (All americans are of

African decent).

</em><br>
<p>On the contrary it sound exactly like you are trying to induce some
<br>
sort of guilt.
<br>
<p>Most of the institutions, and the government, i.e., confederacy,
<br>
that profited from slavery were destroyed in the war it took to
<br>
eliminate it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;After all, the USA has given reparations for Jews, and to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Japanese.  But slavery - which existed for so much longer and was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unprecedented in its cruelty, dealing with selling human beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like chattel - no talk of reparations, no memorials, hardly any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;acknowledgment.  Of course, all the people who dealt directly with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;slavery are gone, but we are still a prosperous nation, and we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;afford to say &quot;thank you,&quot; and &quot;we're sorry for what was done to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you,&quot; and acknowledge the contributions made by slaves.
</em><br>
<p>I am unaware of the U.S paying reparations to Jews, please provide
<br>
a referrence, along with a referrence to slaves building the white
<br>
house.
<br>
<p>The reparations paid to Japanese Americans for the terrible mistake
<br>
they suffered were overdue and very appropriate.
<br>
<p>Like most reparation supporters you continue to ignore the fact
<br>
that slavery was a southern institution and the institutions that
<br>
supported it, and most if not all profits, were destroyed, at very
<br>
great expense I might add.
<br>
<p>We have been paying &quot;guilt&quot; reparations for generations, in the
<br>
form of welfare, public housing, and minority set asides, not
<br>
counting the actual cost of the war itself.
<br>
<p>Bottom line: I think all debts have been paid, and I personnaly owe
<br>
no debt for the actions of others.
