<p>It means earthquakes don't affect seismographs 4 hours before the earthquake happens,
<br>
at least not in a way anybody knows how to interpret.
<br>
<p>If not fraud I can almost guarantee what happened, after the disaster a huge effort was
<br>
made to examine the data, it was &quot;corrected&quot; and analyzed statistically in all sorts of
<br>
ingenious ways until they got something they liked; no similar effort was made at other
<br>
times when nothing special was happening. Computing power is dirt cheap so if
<br>
BEFORE  the event there was a clear criteria as to what was anomalous and what
<br>
was not as claimed then there was no reason on earth the experiment didn't ring a big
<br>
bell 4 hours before the first airplane hit. A bell did not ring, I am not impressed, it's just
<br>
too easy to fool yourself.
