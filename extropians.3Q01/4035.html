Wow! This is brilliant! It doesn't take much imagination to see these 
<br>
stacked many, many stories high (or down under the ground) producing tens 
<br>
of times the amount an acreage normally could. No other form of agriculture 
<br>
could match this level of productivity.
<br>
<p>Maybe it will go retail too. I would buy one or a few if I had the money.
<br>
<p>The concept of isolating the crops from pests is very cool. I eliminates 
<br>
complex, expensive, poisonous pest management.
<br>
<p>Lovely!
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>

<em>&gt;Robot &quot;Farmers&quot; Revolutionize Agriculture?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by Judy Siegel, The Jerusalem Post, September 29, 1999
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Israeli-developed robots that tirelessly tend hydroponically grown organic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vegetables cultivated in standard metal shipping containers promise to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;revolutionize agriculture from Africa to Alaska. Called Grow-Tech 2000, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;integrated systems are stackable and self-contained, and they can replace
</em><br>
<em>&gt;open-field frames, says their inventor, Lior Hessel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The 31-year-old Technion graduate in Agricultural Engineering and Management
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has filed for patents in the US and Israel and expects the first Grow-Tech
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2000 to be on the market within a year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;His prototype, at the OrganiTECH Technion entrepreneurial incubator, has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shown that 500 heads of lettuce can be produced in a single container.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The system is environmentally friendly, using an absolute minimum of water,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;producing oxygen instead of toxic gases from pesticides, and needing merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be plugged into a power source.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The robots monitor the environment, keeping the oxygen, artificial light,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;carbon dioxide, humidity, temperature, mineral levels, and other factors at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;optimum levels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Dozens of lettuce varieties, plus innumerable other vegetables, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, onion, garlic, and herbs can be cultivated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in Grow-Tech 2000. The next step is to grow hormone and chemical-free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strawberries, tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers,&quot; Hessel said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bushes and even trees laden with fruit could follow. The demand for organic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;produce has skyrocketed in the developed world. In the US alone, the market
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for naturally grown products jumped by 30 percent between 1996 and 1997. Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;7.5 billion heads of lettuce eaten in the US each year, 10 percent are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organically grown.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;I predict that conventional agriculture will be finished in Israel in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decade. There just isn't enough water, and fields will be covered over with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;housing. What could remain are organic farms like these systems and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;export of know-how like ours,&quot; said Hessel. He first conceived the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt;several years ago, but has been working on the project since last summer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Technion industrial incubator received seed money from the Chief
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Scientist's Office of the Ministry of Industry and Trade and is now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;considering offers for investors and strategic partners from Israel and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;abroad. Hessel expects the company, which now has six professional staffers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to have hundreds of workers within a year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;The applications are endless,&quot; Hessel said. &quot;We believe we can grow highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pure raw materials for the pharmaceutical industry. We also can solve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem of insects in leafy vegetables for religious Jews whose glatt kosher
</em><br>
<em>&gt;standards demand a complete absence of pests. Also, today large amounts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pesticides are used, but this is not healthy.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hessel doesn't envisage many ordinary people having a self-contained farm in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their garden, but he does believe that the &quot;growing machines&quot; could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;located at retail establishments, such as supermarkets, restaurants, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fast-food places, as well as at distribution commissaries for chain stores.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
