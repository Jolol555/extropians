Oh gods, where to start with this mess? Let me just say in starting that I
<br>
am an astrophysicist (among my other sins, astrophysicist turned
<br>
commerce-tech)...
<br>
<p>.
<br>
.
<br>
.
<br>
<p>after a few minutes of looking at this, I've decided not to even try.
<br>
There's a lot of very good literature out there, but very little of it is in
<br>
date. Cosmology is evolving very, very fast at the moment, and has been for
<br>
the past ten years or so. It's a good example of a field in flux, data
<br>
coming in faster than it can be digested.
<br>
<p>So in brief: cosmic expansion and various modified big bang theories fit
<br>
observed data and other tested models and theories somewhat better than the
<br>
non-expanding universe theories (for example, the cosmic microwave
<br>
background anisotropies come from where?) You shouldn't need anything else
<br>
to say &quot;ok, this theory fits better, let's run with it and see where we
<br>
get.&quot; It's certainly way too soon to be casting opinions on the shape and
<br>
evolution of the universe in anything but the most general terms.
<br>
<p>[And especially not because something feels better. I mean, how many
<br>
generations of astronomers and astrophysicists have slaved away so modern
<br>
humanity can read horoscopes? Sheesh].
<br>
<p>For example, there's a bunch of scientists tackling the sticky problem of
<br>
looking for duplicate galaxies -- if they can find matching galaxies that
<br>
are in fact the same galaxy at different stages of its life, then that
<br>
indicates we're in a very interestly shaped universe. Not much to rule it
<br>
out as an option, either, short of looking hard for a long time and not
<br>
turning anything up.
<br>
<p>After a certain stage, it all begins to seem pretty strange. Ask any
<br>
astrophysicist about measurements and accuracy and oddball things that crop
<br>
up in the wide field views. You just go with the data. (Ions of the same
<br>
charge attract each other in a neutron star magnetosphere. Strange but
<br>
true).
<br>
<p>Reason
<br>
<a href="http://www.exratio.com/">http://www.exratio.com/</a>
<br>
<p>(being bad and quoting the whole damn thing below)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I actually think the steady-state theory makes a LOT more sense than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entire universe popping into existence in one instant,...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd agree that the Big Bang is bunk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Big Bang rests on the hypothesis that the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expanding, and in the end the plausibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of its claims will depend on whether the universe is expanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it’s expanding, it was smaller in the past.  If you reverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the expansion far enough, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; originates at one point.  The Big Bang.  The BB is an immediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequence of the idea that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe is expanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idea that the universe is expanding is built on an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation of the observations of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American astronomer Edwin Hubble, which, when codified, became
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known as “Hubble’s Law.”
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the 1920's Hubble was conducting the first systematic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investigation into our neighboring galaxies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Using a spectrometer to analyze the light emitted from galaxies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he observed a shift to the red end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the spectrum in the light coming from distant galaxies.  Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should galactic light be shifted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the red and not the blue portions of the spectrum? Why, for that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter, should it be shifted at all?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An invigorating stab in the dark now followed. The pitch of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; siren is altered as a police car
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disappears down the street, the sound waves carrying the noise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stretched by the speed of the car
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself. This is the familiar Doppler effect. Something similar,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hubble entertained, might explain the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redshift of the galaxies, with the distortions in their spectral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signature arising as a reflection of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their recessional velocity as they disappeared into the depths.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The redshift of a galaxy, cosmologists affirm, and so its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recessional velocity, is proportional to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its distance and inversely proportional to its apparent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brightness or flux. The relationship is known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Hubble's law, even though Hubble himself even initially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarded the facts at his disposal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skepticism.  [Hubble's original paper carried the footnote: &quot;It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not at all certain that the large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; red shifts in the spectra are to be interpreted as a Doppler
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect, but for convenience they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressed in terms of velocity and referred to as apparent velocities.&quot;]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hubble realized that it was possible, in theory, to further test
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the idea that the redshift
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represented recessional velocity. He already had some preliminary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data from the 100-inch telescope:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot; … redshifts are evidence either of an expanding universe or of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some hitherto unknown principle of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature … Attempt have been made to attain the necessary precision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the 100-inch, and the results
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appear to be significant. If they are valid, it seems likely that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redshifts may not be due to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expanding Universe, and much of the current speculation on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure of the Universe may require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-examination. The significant data, however, were necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obtained at the very limit of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single instrument … therefore the results must be accepted for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the present as suggestive rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitive. The problem is essentially one for the 200-inch.”
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The new 200-inch telescope at Mt Palomar would give him the tools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to carry out that test.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; “We may predict with confidence that the 200-inch will tell us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether the redshifts must be accepted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as evidence of a rapidly expanding Universe, or attributed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some new principle of Nature. Whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the answer may be, the result will be welcomed as another major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribution to the exploration of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Universe.&quot;  He carried out the test, and got a definitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result, but it was not welcomed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In [the aptly named] “The Problem of the Expanding Universe,” in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the section “The Interpretation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Red Shifts,” Hubble writes:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; “The investigations were designed to determine whether or not red
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shifts represent actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recession.   In principle, the problem can be solved; a rapidly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receding light source appears fainter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a similar but stationary source at the same momentary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distance.... For velocities of a few miles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a few hundred miles per second, the dimming factor is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negligible. But for the extremely distant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nebulae, where the apparent recessions reach tens of thousands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miles per second, the effects are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large enough to be readily observed and measured…Since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intrinsic luminosities of nebulae are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known, their apparent faintness furnishes two scales of distance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depending upon whether we assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nebulae to be stationary or receding. If, then, we analyze
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our data, if we map the observable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; region, using first one scale and then the other, we may find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the wrong scale leads to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradictions or at least to grave difficulties.”
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; “Such attempts have been made and one scale does lead to trouble.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It is the scale which includes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dimming factors of recession, which assumes that the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expanding…All of these data lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the very simple conception of a sensibly infinite, homogeneous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe of which the observable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; region is an insignificant sample.” [Edwin Hubble, “The Problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Expanding Universe,” American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientist, Vol. 30, No. 2, April 1942, (p.111), pp. 99-115.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So Hubble, from the outset, doubted that the redshift he observed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represented recessional velocity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He devised a way to further test whether redshifts are evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either of an expanding universe or of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some hitherto unknown principle of nature.  His observations led
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him to conclude these redshifts he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observed were NOT caused by recessional velocity, but by some other cause.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While a receding source will cause emitted light to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redshifted, there are other possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretations of this redshift, the main one being the &quot;tired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light&quot; hypothesis, according to which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the redshift is produced by light losing energy as it travels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through space. Hubble came to accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that cosmological redshifts for the most part are indicators of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distance, not velocity. He felt that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the data was in better agreement with light having a loss of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy to the intervening medium
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proportional to the distance it travels through space by what he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called &quot;a new principle of nature.”
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But a few months later, on 28th September, 1953, Hubble died in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; San Marino, California; and his new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research was buried with him.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So much so that a few years later Hubble's work was summarized in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; epitaphs such as the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;More than ten years were to pass (after the expanding hypothesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had been put forward by De Sitter)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before the observations made by the American astronomer Edwin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hubble were to establish beyond all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable doubt that the Universe was expanding&quot; [W. Bonnor, The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mystery of the expanding universe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Boringhieri, 1967, p. 2.] .
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Hubble's Law. The most serious blow to the stationary state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe … came from Hubble's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measurements of the velocity of the galaxies … after a series of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; painstaking measurements, Hubble
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discovered that on average a galaxy recedes from us at a velocity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proportional to the distance …
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hubble's discovery immediately destroys the idea of a stationary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unchanging universe, Aristotelian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one might say … So, as is indicated by Hubble's Law, 20 thousand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million years ago the galaxies were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presumeably all amassed at the same point&quot;, etc. [T. Regge,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cronache dell'universo, Boringhieri,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1981, p. 44] .
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hubble's law anchors Big Bang cosmology to the real world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But Hubble did not observe the galaxies zooming off into the far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distance. Their recessional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; velocity, and their distance represents a complicated inference,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an intellectual leap.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For more than a decade, the American astronomer Halton Arp has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drawn the attention of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astronomical community to places in the sky where the expected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship between redshift and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distance simply fails. Embarrassingly enough, many quasars seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bound to nearby galaxies. The results
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are in plain sight: there on the photographic plate is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smudged record of a galaxy, and there next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to it is a quasar, the points of light lined up and looking for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the world as if they were equally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; luminous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These observations do not comport with standard Big Bang
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cosmology. If quasars have very large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redshifts, they must (according to Hubble's law) be very far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away; so if they seem nearby, then they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must be FANTASTICALLY luminous! As bright as 1000 simultaneous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supernovas! Yet their temperature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remains that of ordinary stars as exhibited by emission spectra
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of metallic ions that can only exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at a limited range of temperature. They are known to be about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stellar size since they vary in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brightness on a scale of a few minutes to seconds. By insisting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on interpreting quasar red-shifts as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicating great velocity and great distance, cosmologists have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created a monster. How can they stay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so bright at such a low temperature in such a small volume? They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't. They must be nearby, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their redshift is NOT due to their velocity. The tight tidy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; series of inferences that has gone into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Big Bang cosmology, like leverage in commodity trading, works
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beautifully in reverse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The American mathematician I.E. Segal and his associates have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studied the evidence for galactic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recessional velocity over the course of twenty years, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results that are sharply at odds with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictions of Big Bang cosmology. Segal is a distinguished
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematician, one of the creators of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modern function theory and a member of the National Academy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sciences. He has incurred the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indignation of the astrophysical community by suggesting broadly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that their standards of statistical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rigor would shame a sociologist.[!] “Big Bang cosmology,” he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writes, “owes its acceptance as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical principle primarily to the uncritical and premature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representation of [the redshift-distance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship] as an empirical fact.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hubble's law embodies a general hypothesis of Big Bang
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cosmology--namely, that the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expanding--and while the law cannot be established by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observation, observation can establish that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be false. A catalogue of 780 references to redshift
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observations inexplicable by the Doppler
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect was published in 1981 by K. J. Reboul under the title,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Untrivial Redshifts: A Bibliographical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Catalogue.&quot; Many other papers indicate that non-velocity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redshifts have been observed, for example a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lengthy 1989 review article by the Indian astrophysicist J. V.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Narlikar. [J. V. Narlikar, 1989,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Noncosmological Redshifts&quot;, Space Science Reviews, Vol: 50.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Recent astronomical discoveries pose an additional and very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious problem for the Big  Bang theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Larger and larger structures are being found to exist at greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and greater redshifts, indicating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their existence in the increasingly distant past.  In 1988, Simon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lilly of the university of Hawaii
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reported the discovery of a mature galaxy at the enormous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redshift of 3.4; that is, the amount of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redshift for any spectral line from the galaxy is 340 per cent of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the line's proper wavelength (Lilly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1988). This puts the galaxy so far in time that the Big Bang
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scheme does not allow sufficient time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for its formation! At a news report on Lilly's work in Sky &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Telescope expressed it, &quot;The appearance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a mature galaxy so soon after the Big Bang poses a serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat . . .&quot; (Aug. 1988, p. 124).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In 1989 came the discovery of the &quot;Great Wall&quot; of galaxies, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sheet of Galaxies 500 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light-years long, 200 million light-years wide, and approximately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 15 million light-years thick, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dimensions of the structure being limited only by the scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the survey (Geller and Huchra
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1989). It is located between 200 and 300 million light-years from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth. In an interview with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Boston Globe (Nov. 17 1989), Margaret Geller of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offered some frank comments on the implications of her discovery:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; “The size of the structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicates that in present theories of the formation of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe something is really wrong that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes a big difference,…No known force could produce a structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this big in the time since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe was formed&quot;, She said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other interesting observations regarding the reshift are the so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called K-effect, and our sun’s excess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; red-shift.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMHO, the universe is infinite in space and time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hubble was right, the redshifts he observed were due to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other factor than recessional velocity.
