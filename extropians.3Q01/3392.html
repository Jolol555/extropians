<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think your mixing issues here, slavery and its end is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely different issue then as you put it &quot;de jure segregation&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is.
</em><br>
<p>I know what the issues are and how they are different.  I did not mention
<br>
anything about reparations.  I was talking about bigotry, and how it neither
<br>
ended with slavery nor magically go away &quot;7 generations&quot; ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about voluntary segregation?
</em><br>
<p>It's your right to hang around with anyone you want.  But public schools
<br>
should not bar children of a certain color from attending.  And hospitals
<br>
shouldn't have a policy of barring people of a certain color from receiving
<br>
treatment.  And public pools should not be for &quot;whites only.&quot;  Etcetera.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the attempt to correct past and current issues about race,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise well meaning individuals have created new ones as any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; white male can tell you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is current discrimination against white males, which we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not going to ignore as we address these issues.
</em><br>
<p>Hey, I've read Warren Farrell, myself.  Certain biases against men, women,
<br>
ugly people, short people, fat people, poor people (and on and on and on)
<br>
exist, and those are all different subjects in their own right (but cannot
<br>
BEGIN to touch the subject of &quot;white on black&quot; racism that has existed in
<br>
our country).  As to the &quot;any white male can tell you&quot; - all right, let's
<br>
start with the white alpha male currently residing in the White (no pun
<br>
intended) House - can he tell me the terrible trials and tribulations he's
<br>
gone through on his road to recove...eh, I mean, on his road to the White
<br>
House?  I wonder.  Wouldn't he qualify as an &quot;any&quot; male?  Any white male,
<br>
you say, huh?  (Get serious!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One of the problems is that we have not agreed on what &quot;racism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Racist&quot; mean on this list. There are for example those who claim it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has only to do with genetics.
</em><br>
<p>It has to do with history, primarily.  &quot;Race&quot; is not a scientific reality,
<br>
but a social enigma.
<br>
