</em><br>
<p>Lush Bimbeau (AKA Rush Limbaugh) _does_ claim to have truth as his number one
<br>
priority. However, the level of truth that he broadcasts is appropriate for
<br>
eighth grade school children, and for no one more sophisticated. The truth of,
<br>
for example Lao Tzu, is beyond him and his audience. But that's OK, because
<br>
even eighth graders can understand that socialism is flawed, and that's one of
<br>
his favorite themes. (It gets slightly complicated when one appears to side
<br>
with religionists in pointing out the fallacies of socialism.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If religiosity provides the cognitive crutch that some people need in

order to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do their best, then that's fine. Debunking religiosity doesn't require us
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; demean those who need and use religion in private.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not?  Yes, if people are going to entertain false beliefs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd of course prefer that they do it in solitude.  But it still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has to be stated that not only is what they believe false, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is something very wrong with how they think.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but there's something wrong with how near-sighted people see, and that
<br>
doesn't require us to demean them (or deprive them of their eyeglasses).
<br>
Likewise, religiosity is a crutch for &quot;weak-minded&quot; people, which means people
<br>
who can't understand (or who undervalue) the scientific method. So, we can
<br>
agree that there's something very wrong with how they think, but we'll never
<br>
convince _them_ of it (as a few extropians have already mentioned).
<br>
<p>I think this thread (and the &quot;Debunk All Religiosity Equitably&quot; thread) has
<br>
identified some useful URL links and pointed out some excellent books which do
<br>
in fact debunk religiosity -- at least to the satisfaction of anyone who has
<br>
what it takes to appreciate debunking when they see it.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
