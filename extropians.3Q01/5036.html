Dear Hannah:
<br>
<p>I enjoyed your interview with Chris Langdan, said to be the smartest man
<br>
in the USA with an IQ of ~200. Chris has spent most of his adult life
<br>
working as a bouncer and has the bruises to prove it. I would like you to
<br>
ask Chris if his Stupidity Quotient exceeds his Intelligence Quotient.
<br>
Credits have their corresponding debits. Intelligent behaviours have
<br>
corresponding stupid behaviours. It is the NET that counts. Ask Chris if
<br>
his net is in the red. Speaking of &quot;red&quot;, I would like you to interview
<br>
Vladimir Zhirinovsky again to find out if he has mellowed. Just before 
<br>
your last interview he was filmed as he grabbed a fellow Duma member, got
<br>
her in a headlock and dragged her across the floor of the Duma. If you
<br>
want to see red ask Vlad if he is a misogynist; then quickly follow it up
<br>
by asking him if there is anything wrong with him which a lobotomy could
<br>
not cure. You will also understand how I have used my Stupidity Test
<br>
(patent pending) in field situations.
