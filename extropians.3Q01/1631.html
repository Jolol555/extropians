<p><em>&gt; Well, for example, a porn site says that it won't release your identity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to law enforcement when you register as a member, but sells your id and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all your browsing activity to ad and porn marketing companies. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconsistent.
</em><br>
<p>It's worse than inconsistent, isn't it!?  Isn't this an example
<br>
of false advertizing, and weren't we saying that we should make
<br>
such lying illegal?
<br>
<p>If we had freedom---an archaic seventeenth century concept fallen
<br>
into disuse over the last century or so---some sites would offer
<br>
guarantees that they wouldn't sell or distribute information in
<br>
any way, and some sites wouldn't.  After a while, I'd notice when
<br>
sites *didn't* say that, and I'd learn to be wary.  No laws are
<br>
needed here; except, of course, that contracts be honored.
<br>
<p>But today we must have &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot;:  an august body sitting
<br>
on benches in Washington will decide what is good for everybody,
<br>
no matter where they live or who they are, or what they care about
<br>
the matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A consistent application would be that either they provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data to law enforcement under warrant but do not sell to just anybody,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or they sell to anybody and wilfully give to law enforcement, or they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't give any information to anybody.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not getting it, sorry.  As I said before, consistency is
<br>
very admirable, but it pales in comparison to the desirability
<br>
of having just laws, and having just laws obeyed.  I favor sites
<br>
being able to exercise freedom and sell to whomever they please
<br>
for whatever reason they please, so long as they are abiding
<br>
by their contracts, explicit or implicit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Uh, no. Since a minor child is the ward of their parents or other legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guardians, performing medical procedures without their authorization on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their child is highly unethical.
</em><br>
<p>It needs to be determined by law at what age medical
<br>
procedures can be performed on children by doctors.
<br>
You or I may find it unethical regardless, but doctors
<br>
have absolutely no legal right to attend to children
<br>
without their guardian's permission.  (I realize that
<br>
it freaks some people out, but if religious extremists
<br>
don't want their children to receive medical treatment,
<br>
it's NOBODY ELSE'S business.)
