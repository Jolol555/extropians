</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;players who could launch such an attack.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can see a *very* positive effect of not hitting back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the US follow the trail to the culprits and bring them to justice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legally USA would be seen as impeccably just and even-handed. They would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remain the victim in the tragedy. Sympathy would be with USA and the poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilians who suffered (and continue to suffer) from this terrible act.
</em><br>
<p>And of course, according to left wing victimology, it is better to
<br>
continue looking like a victim than to prevent future victimization.
<br>
<p>Get this straight: we don't want your pity. Our freinds respect us
<br>
because we treat each other like freinds, and allies know their own.
<br>
Those who perpetrated this act have seen the US refuse to act against
<br>
them for eight years with measured responses and as a result see us as
<br>
weak wimps who do not respond to attacks. These are people who only
<br>
understand force. They see your victimology as the pathetic capitulation
<br>
of the moral coward (which is what it is) to the predator. We refuse to
<br>
live in a world of predators and prey, we refuse to be victims, serfs,
<br>
slaves, or cowards. Mercy is for one's creator to grant. We have no
<br>
reason to ever expect any from them, they will get none from us. We know
<br>
that there is real, objective, concrete, solid, distinguishable good and
<br>
evil in the world. We refuse to accept rationalizations in place of
<br>
reason, excuses for irresponsibility in place of acceptance of
<br>
responsibility. 
<br>
<p>Relativity is for photons, not morals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If, however, USA goes off half-cocked firing blindly at all comers then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain of the people in the WTC will be overshadowed and, worldwide, less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people will feel sympathy. Worse, those who get struck but were innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be the next round of terrorists to kill more US citizens.
</em><br>
<p>Societies get the governments they deserve, and societies that choose
<br>
the governments they have, through democratic or other means (what is
<br>
more democratic than a civil war, winner takes all). Thus societies are
<br>
collectively responsible for the acts of those governments, and those
<br>
who support, rationalize, recruit, excuse, shelter, succor, aid,
<br>
promote, or lionize these individuals are collectively responsible for
<br>
the acts the terrorists have committed.
<br>
<p>This is not just my standard, this is the standard that bin Laden, the
<br>
palestinians, the iraqis, and other radical groups have imposed on us in
<br>
justifying this attack. They claim that we are reaping what we sowed. I
<br>
say 'turnabout is fair play'. It is our responsibility to do so. In the
<br>
world of force which these people ascribe to, he who has the biggest
<br>
stick is responsible for determining the rules, whether he does so or
<br>
not. If you don't set the rules, they will be set for you. Bin Laden is
<br>
setting the rules right now because we haver refused to act. Our only
<br>
move now is ejecting him from the game.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To avoid over-reaction would be to help defuse the whole thing, make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everybody feel safer, and turn world opinion massively against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists. The bad guys would lose in a big way. But it would have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; followed up with softening foreign policy. USA has done some despicable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things around the world. Australia is no angel here either (Bougainville
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes me moan).
</em><br>
<p>No, they would not. This wimp attitude has been the rule for the last 8
<br>
years. It turns out that Clinton, for example, had very explicit
<br>
information last year he could have used to rid the world of bin Laden,
<br>
but did not do so because his namby pamby liberal advisors didn't want
<br>
the risks.
<br>
<p>There is no such thing as moral equivalency. It is an excuse of the
<br>
moral coward.
