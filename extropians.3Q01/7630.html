I agree with Harvey that the security goal of steganography is to embed
<br>
a message in a picture such that an attacker can't tell if there is a
<br>
message there.  That is the point of steganography.  Being able to tell
<br>
means breaking the security.
<br>
<p>Further asking the attacker to extract the message is meaningless, because
<br>
the message can be encrypted such that it looks equivalent to random noise,
<br>
and extracting such a message is of no value.
<br>
<p>If all you wanted was to keep your messages from being read, ordinary
<br>
encryption will suffice.  You use steganography because you want to hide
<br>
the very fact that you are sending messages.  Hence if the attacker can
<br>
tell that you are sending something, the steganography is broken.
<br>
<p>However I think the tests which have been offered here are not good,
<br>
because the same cover image is used in each one.  In practice an attacker
<br>
generally does not have access to a reference image with no (or little)
<br>
embedded data to compare with the modified version.
<br>
<p>What you should do is to use a variety of different images, of different
<br>
sizes, numbers of colors, and qualities, and embed messages in some of
<br>
them and not in others.  This would be a more meaningful test in being
<br>
similar to the actual task facing a steganographic attacker.
