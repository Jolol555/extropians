<p>I wouldn't say that. I would say that they only focus on health problems
<br>
for which there is a significant market, generally, and when they find a
<br>
drug treats a rather rare disease, with lets say only a few hundred
<br>
cases in the entire world, they have to not only divide the cost of
<br>
tooling up, producing, and distributing the few doses of the drug to
<br>
such a small market, that market has to absorb the huge amounts of
<br>
research that went into discovering that drug. If, say, one dose costs
<br>
many thousands of dollars, the drug company generally won't even put it
<br>
through FDA trials (which is necessary to make it coverable by
<br>
insurance), because such trials would require the company to treat the
<br>
entire population that is sick, which kills the market, and you can't
<br>
get paid for it after the fact by the insurance company.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many of the great success stories in clobbering diseases are publicly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funded. They drive such things as health and sanitation education, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vaccination programs. Of course these then provide the market and incentive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for corporations to refine and supply the vaccines, etc. Both sides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (capitalist and publicly funded organisations) need each other to create a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balanced environment.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we had just capitalism managing medicine then we would see incredibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive medicine that would serve the rich (that's where the money is),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not much else.
</em><br>
<p>You are improperly assuming that no capitalist would engage in
<br>
philanthropic activities, which is actually how much of the non-profit
<br>
research is funded.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we had only publicly managed medicine then we would see medicine ossify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and become more and more entrenched in tradition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neither is the whole solution. Diversity, as in most things, is important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I worry when the economic rationalist religion is propagated as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimate truth. It isn't. The world just isn't that simple.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did you know that many people who travel to USA worry about getting ill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while over there and accruing massive and crippling medical bills for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatment that in Australia or UK or Europe would be relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconsequential? Your medical system is heavily privatised and the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive on the planet.
</em><br>
<p>Part of the reason it is so expensive is because socialist health
<br>
systems externalize their highest costs onto our market, which drives up
<br>
demand and therefore prices. How is this done? By purposely rationing
<br>
expensive treatements such that the waiting lines for these treatments
<br>
are longer than the life expectancy of the patients, so they instead
<br>
come here to the US, pay out of their own pocket to get treated, and
<br>
their buying that treatment here drives up the price here for our sick
<br>
people to get the same treatment. 
<br>
<p>If socialized health care systems provided the same access to care that
<br>
we provide here, then our system would not be so expensive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't get me wrong. I am not saying the US medical system is crap. It has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its uses -- its advantages and disadvantages... but that doesn't make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better than other systems. In fact American medicine is becoming irrelevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to large parts of its own society thru its inability to attend to the needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the great numbers of poor.
</em><br>
<p>Because the health market is being distorted by the externalities of
<br>
socialized medicine in other countries.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Darn... I have this horrible, sinking feeling I have just started a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patriotic, capitalist, flame war... oops.  :-)
</em><br>
<p>Nope, not at all. I think that hospitals themselves are also to blame.
<br>
For example, the largest local hospital here has lost its non-profit
<br>
status with respect to local property taxes because it only provides
<br>
2.5% of its services for free to poor people, which is less than the
<br>
average for for-profit hospitals in this state, and less than half that
<br>
of other non-profit hospitals in this state (which still means that
<br>
non-profits in this state on average only provide 5% of their services
<br>
for free). At the same time, this local hospital generates $2.5 million
<br>
in 'profits' each year that are funnelled into an umbrella fund raising
<br>
organization that owns everything, which has no employees, and which
<br>
spends $5 million a year in order to 'raise' $2.5 million (the other
<br>
$2.5 million comes from the profits of its subsidiary corporations). Of
<br>
the funds it spends, this includes $2.5 million that organization pays
<br>
out to the five trustees of the hospital for being trustees....
<br>
<p>This is a hospital that claims to be 'non-profit'....
