<p>Yes, it is far more a matter of a fraction who feed off of the
<br>
resentment and dissappointment of members of a culture that was once the
<br>
most sophisticated in the world (or at least thought itself so) that
<br>
spanned from Polynesia to Morocco, and was the trade crossroads of the
<br>
world. It has fallen from that point to a bunch of divisive countries,
<br>
many of which are now in Third World status economically and otherwise,
<br>
and the general cultural consensus among most is that it is the fault of
<br>
the Crusaders and the countries/cultures which spawned them. Of course,
<br>
the fact that most of them picked the wrong side in two european wars
<br>
(WWI and the Cold War) doesn't seem to get much recognition, and they
<br>
don't consider the idea that despite sitting on  the greatest wealth in
<br>
the world, many of them act more like spoiled brats than a mature
<br>
sophisticated society.
