<em>&gt; If anyone believes the former, I can't help you. We are getting into these

</em><br>
<p>A public school system CAN be economically efficient if it is subject to
<br>
the same competetive pressures of the free market, and if all of the
<br>
people are given their freedom to choose (why is it left wingers seem to
<br>
think we should have freedom of choice in some things, but not in
<br>
others?).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, arguments based on economics are another story. I'm as fiscally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative and as alert to the practical advantages of competition and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual decision making as most people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, is there a way to redistribute money to the poorer people in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community to pay for a good education for their kids, while keeping the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantages of competition, decentralisation, etc, which Lee has extolled so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persuasively?
</em><br>
<p>Yes. Do as I've been describing: all the state needs to do is to state
<br>
that all schools must provide financial aid based on a family's
<br>
disposable income, and graduates contract to pay a percent of future
<br>
earnings for a specified period. This reinstitutes the sort of
<br>
'apprentice' system that has worked so well for thousands of years.
<br>
Another proper function of the state is to protect children: to ensure
<br>
that parents don't put their personal addictions ahead of the welfare of
<br>
their children, whether they be drugs, booze, smokes, or lottery
<br>
tickets.
