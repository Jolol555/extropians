<p>Your submission to the parliamentary enquiry is indeed a good, crisp model
<br>
for others to emulate. I hope people feel encouraged to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Last week, I posted some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fairly daunting material on the list, which was in answer to an anti-cloning
</em><br>
<em>&gt;article I came across in _The Journal of Law and Medicine_. The material I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;posted was a short extract, dealing with &quot;human dignity&quot;, from an 8500-word
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophical article that I wrote in reply. My latest good news is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Journal has now accepted this for publication. 
</em><br>
<p>Congratulations! It'd be nice to see a lot more of this from others on the
<br>
list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Damien has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;managed to get material published here in places with much larger audiences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than any of these.
</em><br>
<p>Last night, Emlyn appeared on the national Aussie TV program AFTERSHOCK, on
<br>
the topic of `Cyborgs', under the Extropian banner. His contributions seem
<br>
to have been slightly cut&amp;pasted. How'd you feel about it, Emmers?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;PS If anyone goes to the site I posted, have a look at Professor Julian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Savulescu's submission
</em><br>
<p>Julian is a rare example of a rational and articulate contributor to
<br>
ethicism debates on hitech issues. He appeared with me and a couple of
<br>
others in taping the final ep of AFTERSHOCK, scheduled for the last
<br>
Thursday in July. 
<br>
<p>Oh, and next month I've been invited to give the keynote address to a big
<br>
four-day dog &amp; pony show in Brisbane, `Ideas at the Powerhouse', where my
<br>
speech has been entitled (not by me) `The world will get weirder - the end
<br>
of the human era'. They're even paying me decently to be there, mixing with
<br>
the Nobel Prize laureates and all... :)
