<br>
<p>Facts about Kennewick Man
<br>
<p>* He was 45 to 50 years old at the time of death.
<br>
<p>* He stood 5 feet 9 to 5 feet 10 inches tall and had a slender build.
<br>
<p>* He had all his teeth except for two molars; teeth showed only light wear
<br>
<p>* DNA testing showed he ate mostly fish
<br>
<p>* He had at least six fractured ribs that had healed, and damage to his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;left shoulder muscle
<br>
<p>* A segment of stone projectile embedded in a pelvic bone -- a wound likely
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sustained when he was a teen-ager
<br>
<p>* Completeness of the skeleton indicates the body was placed in a grave
<br>
<p>* His cranium is unlike that of any modern population, but is closest to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;people of the South Pacific (Moriori, Easter Island), and the Ainu of Japan
<br>
<p>Scientists tussle with U.S. over early North America
<br>
<p>By Paul L. Allen
<br>
Citizen Staff Writer
<br>
<p>Vance Haynes loves nothing better than a puzzle, and he's frustrated at not
<br>
being able to help solve a 9,500-year-old mystery known as Kennewick Man.
<br>
<p>That's why he and seven other top-level scientists are suing the federal
<br>
government to gain access to the ancient skeletal remains discovered in
<br>
1996 in Washington state.
<br>
<p>Haynes and colleagues believe the bones -- a nearly complete skeleton of a
<br>
slender, middle-aged man -- could radically change our view of the first
<br>
Americans.
<br>
<p>Haynes, regents' professor emeritus of geoarchaeology at University of
<br>
Arizona, and the others are contesting a decision by Bruce Babbitt,
<br>
secretary of the interior under the Clinton administration and a former
<br>
governor of Arizona, to hand the remains to one or more Native American
<br>
groups for reburial.
<br>
<p>When Haynes first heard about the issue, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
<br>
was about to transfer the remains to the Indians.
<br>
<p>&quot;My first thought was, well, they shouldn't do that until it's studied.
<br>
The study itself could help determine which tribe it should be repatriated
<br>
to,&quot; Haynes said.
<br>
<p>&quot;By studying it, we might be able to make a DNA connection to an existing
<br>
tribe,&quot; he added.
<br>
<p>Haynes tried to share his concern in a letter to the corps.
<br>
<p>&quot;I never got an answer,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>While discussing the matter with a friend, Dennis Stanford, the head of
<br>
archaeology at the Smithsonian Institution, Haynes learned of the lawsuit.
<br>
<p>Stanford invited him to join those suing.  Haynes agreed.
<br>
<p>Last month, another scientist suing with Haynes, C. Loring Brace of the
<br>
Museum of Anthropology at the University of Michigan, released results
<br>
of a new study that examined and measured nearly 10,000 ancient human
<br>
skulls collected from around the world.
<br>
<p>The study indicated the first Americans were most closely related to the
<br>
Jomon, who lived in Japan thousands of years ago.
<br>
<p>Evidence suggests the Jomon and a later group, the Ainu, crossed what now
<br>
is the Bering Strait about 15,000 years ago and migrated from Alaska to
<br>
the tip of South America.
<br>
<p>The Jomon-Ainu were not the people who now live in Japan, Bruce said, but
<br>
had some characteristics of Europeans.
<br>
<p>The study indicated that during the first migration, ice covered much of
<br>
the northern world, causing sea levels to drop several hundred feet,
<br>
opening land bridges from Alaska to Siberia.
<br>
<p>A second migration occurred between 3,000 and 4,000 years ago, this time
<br>
by boat.
<br>
<p>It involved people who were a mix of Chinese, Southeast Asian and
<br>
Mongolian, people who became what we know as the Eskimo and Aleut.
<br>
<p>Some of these people migrated south to what would become the American
<br>
Southwest, evolving as Navajo and Apache.
<br>
<p>Kennewick Man is one of more than a half-dozen of the earliest known
<br>
skeletal remains that pose a perplexing problem to a scientific community
<br>
that, with some exceptions, has accepted the premise that the earliest
<br>
settlers in North America were direct forebears of modern-day Native
<br>
Americans.
<br>
<p>The problem is that Kennewick Man's cranium is distinctly unlike those of
<br>
Native Americans, and displays what archaeologists describe as &quot;caucasoid&quot;
<br>
characteristics.
<br>
<p>That does not mean Kennewick Man was Caucasian, they noted, but that his
<br>
skull measurements differ markedly from those accepted as typical of Native
<br>
Americans.
<br>
<p>Kennewick's cranium is not as broad as those of modern Native Americans.
<br>
He has a longer and narrower brain case, or cranial vault, and is less
<br>
heavily built in the facial area.
<br>
<p>Haynes said his interest in the case would be investigating the provenance
<br>
-- the earth strata from which the skeletal remains were washed out -- for
<br>
other clues to Kennwick Man's era and culture.
<br>
<p>&quot;I would want to determine if the geologic position of it is consistent
<br>
with the carbon 14 dates.  If the carbon 14 dates aren't right, then
<br>
people need to understand that.&quot;
<br>
<p>One tool in dating remains, he said, is Mazama ash layer, the result of a
<br>
volcanic eruption that occurred about 6,800 years ago, blanketing much of
<br>
the Northwest United States in a blanket of white ash.
<br>
<p>&quot;We think the remains came from below that, but you've got to keep in mind,
<br>
no one saw the bones when they were in the bank of the creek,&quot; Haynes said.
<br>
<p>And that, he added, is why it is important for scientists to be able to
<br>
examine the terrace from which the bones came.  Unfortunately, the site is
<br>
on federal property, and the government, after a brief geologic study, has
<br>
halted continued examination or trenching.  And the government has covered
<br>
part of the site with tons of rip-rap.
<br>
<p>&quot;The federal government spent over $100,000 to bury it and plant trees,&quot;
<br>
Haynes said.  &quot;If you plant trees, you're going to have roots going down
<br>
and disturbing any archaeological remains still at the site.  And the
<br>
organic matter will make radiocarbon dating more difficult.&quot;
<br>
<p>The government considers the rip-rap a way to protect the site.  Haynes
<br>
and the other scientists see it as an obstruction.
<br>
<p>&quot;Was it a burial?  We don't know.  That's why it is so important to examine
<br>
the site and maybe even conduct excavations on that terrace,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>In general, Haynes said, he doesn't have a problem with &quot;repatriating&quot; the
<br>
remains for reburial after they have been thoroughly studied.  But that
<br>
position could change.
<br>
<p>&quot;The one hesitation is that, what if five years from now we have some new
<br>
technology that is just leaps and bounds ahead of what we know now?  It
<br>
would be unfortunate if there was no longer any access.  That's strictly
<br>
my own opinion.&quot;
<br>
<p>Haynes said he discussed Kennewick Man with a Native American colleague,
<br>
a Hopi who is a faculty member with American Indian Studies at UA.
<br>
<p>&quot;I talked with Emory Sekaquaptewa and he said, 'We're not all one Indian.
<br>
I am just as anxious to learn about it as you are, where he came from
<br>
and all of that.'&quot;
<br>
<p>But, Haynes added, Sekaquaptewa warned that the effort would run into
<br>
problems with the Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act.
<br>
<p>The legal wars have proven that true.  But for Haynes, analyzing the
<br>
bones is more about science than winning.
<br>
<p>&quot;We're studying to find out what the heck happened.  I'm not interested in
<br>
winning any arguments.  I just want a reason for why this guy died, where
<br>
he came from and how he relates to the people, both earlier and later,
<br>
that we know of from archaeology.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>[INSET] OTHERS INVOLVED IN LAWSUIT
<br>
<p>C. Vance Haynes, a University of Arizona professor emeritus, is one of
<br>
eight scientists who are suing to force the government to allow more
<br>
study of Kennewick Man remains before they ultimately are reburied.
<br>
The others are:
<br>
<p>* Robson Bonnichsen, director of the Center for the Study of First
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Americans, and an anthropology professor at Oregon State University.
<br>
<p>* C. Loring Bruce, curator of biological anthropology and a professor of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;anthropology at the University of Michigan.
<br>
<p>* George W. Gill, a professor of anthropology at the University of Wyoming.
<br>
<p>* Richard L. Jantz, a physical anthropologist at the University of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tennessee at Knoxville.
<br>
<p>* Douglas W. Owsley, a physical anthropologist for the Smithsonian
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Institution.
<br>
<p>* Dennis J. Stanford, director of archaeology at the Smithsonian.
<br>
<p>* D. Gentry Steele, associate head of the Anthropology Department, Texas
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A&amp;M University.
<br>
<p>Among those who believe they have kinship with Kennewick Man, and are
<br>
laying claim to the remains, are:
<br>
<p>* Colville tribal group.
<br>
<p>* An alliance of tribal groups including Colville, Umatilla, Nes Pearce
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and Wanapum.
<br>
<p>* Asutru Folk Assembly, a traditional European religion.
<br>
<p>* Joseph P. Siofele of Manu'a, American Samoa.
<br>
<p><p>[INSET] OPINIONS IN KENNEWICK SUIT
<br>
<p>Alan L. Schneider, Portland, Ore., attorney representing plaintiffs:
<br>
<p>* &quot;If an individual (like Kennewick Man) is 440 generations old, if he has,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in fact, living descendants, they could be living anywhere in the world.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The time span between us and the Revolutionary War is only about 11
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;generations.  Kennewick Man is 40 times that.&quot;
<br>
<p>* &quot;The court is aware that whatever it decides is likely to be viewed as a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;precedent, and it will be extremely cautious to try to reach as thorough
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and well-thought-out a result as a court can reach.  We're figuring there
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;will be an appeal one way or the other.&quot;
<br>
<p>* &quot;We don't know all the reasons the government is leaning toward the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Native Americans.  I believe they made it for political, rather than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;legal and scientific, reasons.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Francis &quot;Frank&quot; P. McManamon, archeologist, National Park Service:
<br>
<p>* &quot;It's not a secret that there was considerable debate over the issue of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cultural affiliation within the Department of the Interior.  Even the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;secretary at the time, Bruce Babbitt, said he felt there was cultural
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;affiliation, and the secretary, after weighing the evidence, felt there
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;was a reasonable connection between modern man and ancient.&quot;
<br>
<p>* &quot;The Department of Interior did a great deal of investigation themselves.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It employed between 15 and 20 internationally recognized scientists ... .
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They did scientific examinations of the remains on two different
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;occasions -- a physical examination of the remains, extensive recordings
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of various features of the remains, several radiocarbon tests to try to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;date the remains, and an attempt to do a DNA analysis.  That ultimately
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;proved unsuccessful.&quot;
<br>
<p>* &quot;They (Corps of Engineers) put riprap, a preservation technique, put a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lot of heavy stones along the edge of the river (where the bones were
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;discovered), something the Corps felt was important . . . they (the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;scientists suing the government) may view it as a hindrance.  We view
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it as protection.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>James L. Chatters, physical anthropologist, owner of Applied Paleoscience,
<br>
Kirkland, Wash.:
<br>
<p>* &quot;We heard that the final word on the (National Park Service) internal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;staff report was that there was no (tribal) affiliation (with Kennewick
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Man), but that they were told to take that out... .  I've never seen
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;this level of vehemence at getting to a skeleton before.  At the time,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;we had two other skeletons that had been in a locker for two years, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;they (tribal officials) waited another two years to pick them up.&quot;
<br>
<p>* &quot;I don't agree that the DNA testing went far enough.  DNA experts have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;requested teeth, which are very dense.  They (federal officials) refused
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;both, and they had to do with fragments of rib and hand bones, where
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(DNA) survivability is very low.&quot;
<br>
<p>* &quot;Racial groups we now know didn't even exist that far back (9,500 years
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ago).  Race is more of a political statement . . . to try to fit something
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;from 9,000 years ago into one of those pigeonholes is inappropriate.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Armand Minthorn, chairman, Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian
<br>
Reservation's cultural resources commission:
<br>
<p>* &quot;It gives me a tremendous feeling knowing that this Ancient One has been
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reaffirmed as one of our ancestors.  As tribal people who have lived on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the Columbia Plateau for thousands of years, we are eager to rebury our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ancestor and give him back to the earth.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>[INSET] DISCOVERING KENNEWICK MAN
<br>
<p>Skeletal remains now called Kennewick Man were discovered July 28, 1996, on
<br>
federal property outside Kennewick, Wash., by two young men watching a boat
<br>
race on the Columbia River.
<br>
<p>The skull and other bones had washed out of an embankment nd ended up in
<br>
shallow water at the edge of the river.  A coroner was called to the scene,
<br>
and noting that the remains appeared old, he asked James C. Chatters, a
<br>
physical anthropologist and owner of Applied Paleoscience in nearby
<br>
Kirkland, Wash., to examine the bones.
<br>
<p>It was initially thought the bones might have been the remains of a trapper
<br>
or &quot;mountain man,&quot; but close examination showed the tip of a flaked stone
<br>
spear point embedded in the pelvic bone.  The bone had healed over the
<br>
spear point.
<br>
<p>Carbon-14 dating tests were performed on the bones, and results showed the
<br>
remains to be 9,500 years old -- one of the earliest human remains
<br>
discovered in North America.
<br>
<p>Chatters, who had suspected from the shape of the cranium that the remains
<br>
came from someone of European descent, realized the significance of the
<br>
find.  He and other researchers then began a closer examination of the
<br>
bones, including starting a DNA testing procedure.
<br>
<p>However, tribal groups learned of the discovery and told Army Corps of
<br>
Engineers officials that they wanted the bones repatriated, because their
<br>
oral tradition told them they had lived in the area of discovery &quot;forever&quot;
<br>
and therefore had a kinship claim to the remains.
<br>
<p>The Corps offered researchers to stop their testing, seized the remains
<br>
and locked them in a vault.  Apparently realizing the find was a political
<br>
hot potato, the Corps quickly turned them over to the Department of the
<br>
Interior, which assigned them to the National Park Service.
<br>
<p>Before this was done, however, Native American representatives were allowed
<br>
to view the bones and to perform ritual ceremonies with them -- some of
<br>
which included placing tree boughs on them.
<br>
<p>Attorneys representing Haynes and the other scientists objected, saying
<br>
the government was playing favorites in allowing some to view the bones
<br>
and not others.
<br>
<p>By the time the National Park Service had the remains curated at Burke
<br>
Museum in Washington state, two pieces of leg bone were missing.  They
<br>
since have been found, according to a National Park Service spokesman,
<br>
but how they came to be missing isn't known.
<br>
<p>Today, the bones remain in the Burke Museum, awaiting a court decision
<br>
on their fate.
