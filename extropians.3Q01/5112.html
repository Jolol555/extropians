Not neccessarily.

<p>If I was Saddam Hussein circa 1990, smarting from the Iran/Iraq war
<br>
and wanting to get my own back on the Ayatollah, I couldn't think of a
<br>
better way than by mounting a botched A-bomb attack on New York using
<br>
confused Iranian expatriates as &quot;useful idiots&quot;.
<br>
<p>(Talk about leveraging one A-bomb into a strategic nuclear strike ..!)
<br>
<p>The problem with the logic of retribution is that it hands any terrorist
<br>
group with a single A-bomb a tremendous force multiplier -- as long as
<br>
they're smart enough to use it as a tool of misdirection rather than a
<br>
blunt instrument.
<br>
<p>(Luckily for us most violent terrorists are bloodthirsty idiots rather
<br>
than subtle thinkers.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;Why would a terrorist want to use ICBMs? Tell me why this is

</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
What's a &quot;rogue nation&quot; when it's at home?
<br>
<p>Seems to me that it's a country with diplomatic goals different
<br>
from and incompatible with your own, and which isn't willing to
<br>
restrict its pursuit of them to those channels you deem to be 
<br>
acceptable. 
<br>
<p>However, _no_ &quot;rogue nation&quot; has a goal that boils down to (a) whack
<br>
the United States with a nuke, and (b) sit around waiting to die.
<br>
It would basically require a collective leadership that is suicidal --
<br>
even North Korea doesn't meet that criterion. (Witness their rather
<br>
carefully stage-managed &quot;we're lunatics and we're going to test IRBMs
<br>
until you give us some food aid&quot; tactics in the late nineties.)
<br>
<p>I figure the most likely _use_ of an A-bomb by a &quot;rogue nation&quot; (as
<br>
defined above) would be either to join the nuclear club -- seeking
<br>
legitimization by going public (and by the same token, not actually
<br>
shooting at anyone -- see India/Pakistan for recent example of this),
<br>
or to provoke a US retalliation against their own worst regional enemy.
<br>
<p>In which case, their goal will be to have US security people _capture_
<br>
a nuke, in the hands of people who can convincingly be portrayed as
<br>
belonging to The Other Side, rather than actually setting such a nuke
<br>
off on US soil. (If they did that, and were found out later, they'd
<br>
get more than a slap over the wrist.)
<br>
<p>This being the case, I have a strong suspicion that this very gambit
<br>
has actually happened more than once -- indeed, that it might be a
<br>
standard part of covert diplomacy. It's an intriguing explanation 
<br>
for the way that Libya became a total Public Enemy #1 in the 1980's
<br>
without actually doing a hell of a lot (certainly not compared to
<br>
Syria) in the terrorism stakes. Mossad arranges for the FBI to capture
<br>
an A-bomb with &quot;to Ronnie, with love from Muammar&quot; painted on it in 
<br>
1981? Something like that.
<br>
<p>I guess the moral of the story is: don't believe what they tell you.
<br>
Nobody is dumb enough to think that setting off an A-bomb at a ball
<br>
game in the USA is going to do anything other than bring down the
<br>
full force -- in anger -- of the US government on them. So if any
<br>
such event occurs, look for the man busily pulling levers behind the 
<br>
curtain.
