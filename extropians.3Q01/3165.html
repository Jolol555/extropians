<p>
Just out of curiosity, I'm wondering how many on this list feel they came up 
<br>
with the idea of the singularity on their own. I feel like I did, and was 
<br>
surprised to find an organization based, in large part, on the concept.
<br>
<p>That brings me to a broader issue: I wonder to what extent important ideas in 
<br>
humanity's development owe their geneses to individuals versus the zeitgeist 
<br>
of the times. Evolution by natural selection would almost surely have been 
<br>
discovered without Darwin and Wallace. Discovery of the structure of DNA 
<br>
really didn't need Francis and Crick. General relativity? I dunno. 
<br>
<p>And if we could settle this question, would that have any important 
<br>
consequences for how we should try to acheive an extropian future? For 
<br>
example, if we could convince ourselves that the ideas and technologies that 
<br>
will foster the kind of future we want will owe their origins, in large part, 
<br>
to the general intellectual climate of the times, then we might see 
<br>
augmenting intelligence as a less important means than influencing societal 
<br>
views. 
<br>
<p>On another topic entirely, I'd like to confess sympathy with a very 
<br>
anti-extropian idea: Civilization and technology are bad and unnatural. Hehe..
<br>
I'm no longer certain that people have &quot;better&quot; lives today than they did in 
<br>
prehistoric times. We are not biologically adapted to the worry-prone, 
<br>
insecure, estranged lives that are part and parcel of American society today. 
<br>
Chronic stress, anorexia, depression, obesity--these are a few maladies that 
<br>
are likely much more prevalent today than in prehistoric times. Maybe the 
<br>
anarchists are onto something. 
<br>
I suppose my rejoinder to the above (yes, I argue with myself) is that these 
<br>
are objections to a particular society and particular uses of technology, not 
<br>
to civilization and technology themselves, which have majestic *potential*.
<br>
<p>By the way, I really wish I hadn't seen Ayn Rand's works featured so 
<br>
prominently in the Extropy Institute's reading list. Objectivism, insofar as 
<br>
it's not coextensive with laissez-faire political and economic thought, does 
<br>
not seem to me to be a natural fit with the extropian worldview. Nor did I 
<br>
care for the favored interpretation of consciousness that was evident in the 
<br>
listing of Churchland's book, which again, doesn't seem necessarily consonant 
<br>
with an extropian outlook. But maybe I'm reading too much into the reading 
<br>
list.
