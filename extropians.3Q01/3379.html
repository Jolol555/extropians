<p>Did you really see, or only think you saw? Please see below.

<p><em>&gt; Now in the case of some information (usually discomforting information) I

<p>I suggest you re-read what he wrote. Notice &quot;...sometimes registered more vividly...&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Does this sound like a disadvantage to you? Does it sound like something that is totally value-neutral?
<br>
<p>What is the advantage in not thinking while reading?
<br>
<p>I know some advantages in not thinking about walking while walking, or a host of other conditioned responses/patterns
<br>
such as virtuoso musicianship. Was what you just did anything like that?
<br>
<p>Is it evidence of some kind of virtuosity? Are you practicing to get good at something? If so, what?
