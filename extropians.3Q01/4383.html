In your opinion, is this stealing DNA? (my apologies if this case has already been posted - I accidentally deleted a few emails about the &quot;stealing DNA&quot; discussion):

<p>Rapist snared with a sleight of straw - and his DNA 
<br>
<p>By Christine Hanley
<br>
Los Angeles Times
<br>
SANTA ANA, Calif. - A suspect who was tricked by a police detective into leaving his saliva on a straw at a Taco Bell pleaded guilty to two rape charges Monday in a case that even his lawyer said represented a legitimate yet unusual use of DNA evidence. 
<br>
<p>Brea, Calif., police Detective Susan Hanna had been working on the case for months and thought Robert William Bradford Jr. was the culprit when she invited him to a Taco Bell, saying she wanted to pick his brain about the case. 
<br>
<p>After Bradford finished his soda, Hanna got him a refill, replacing his straw and, on her way out, handing the old straw to a detective disguised as an employee. 
<br>
<p>The straw was sent to a crime lab for DNA testing, which connected Bradford to the rapes. 
<br>
<p>&quot;It was a shot in the dark,&quot; Hanna said. &quot;It paid off.&quot; 
<br>
<p>And despite the detective's ploy, Bradford's attorney said Monday he thinks the evidence was gathered legally. 
<br>
<p>Police &quot;did not unreasonably seize or delay Mr. Bradford. He voluntarily had the soda with the cops. They were tricky. But they weren't illegal,&quot; Donald Barkemeyer said. 
<br>
<p>Bradford was sentenced Monday to two life terms in prison plus 52 years for attacking a 24-year-old woman at her Brea home in 1998 and a 19-year-old woman at an apartment complex in 2000. In each case, he slipped through an unlocked door at night. 
<br>
<p>Hanna said she linked the two rapes after the second victim said her attacker reeked of smoke and also recalled how a chain-smoker who lived in the same apartment complex frequently stared in the direction of her home. 
<br>
<p>After identifying Bradford as the suspect, Hanna discovered he used to live in the neighborhood where the other attack took place. That woman confirmed her attacker was a smoker.
