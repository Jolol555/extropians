<em>&gt;&gt; Can you explain more what you mean by direct experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in the absence of thought?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When the brain observes, listens, and feels without commenting...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By direct experience in the absence of thought I mean first hand, in person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience.  For example, the first time one bites into a tomato, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience is direct and may occur without any thought happening at the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time. Driving a car 200 MPH, some drivers report that the experience displaces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ordinary stream of thought. It is direct and unfiltered by thinking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. So direct experience in the absence of thought is nevertheless registered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the brain, and sometimes registered more vividly than would be the case if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accompanied or diluted by thinking.
</em><br>
<p>I see.  Korzybski sometimes described this as &quot;delaying the semantic reflex&quot;.
<br>
Now in the case of some information (usually discomforting information) I
<br>
can see a role for this process.  What is the advantage in not thinking while
<br>
eating a tomato or driving a car?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Who is it that seeks this control if not the old brain?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Yes, it is the old mind---that is, our present minds---which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; seek this control.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps the word &quot;mind&quot; obscures the issue, because this word can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpreted in more than one way.  So I say parts of the brain seek
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control, and as the brain comes to recognize and acknowledge the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unity of reality, it understands that control is an illusion.
</em><br>
<p>It is *no* illusion.  Our brains are already in great control of our
<br>
lives, and this control must be increased.  Already we (admirably)
<br>
try to control more and more of our physical environment (just think
<br>
how comfortable your present surroundings are at this very moment).
<br>
Now *this* control will be ultimately unnecessary; we have to do it
<br>
now, otherwise we would be constantly bothered by our sensors indicating
<br>
that it is too hot or too cold, etc.  Eventually we will control instead
<br>
our own *reactions* to that sensory information; there may be many
<br>
times when we want to be in a cold or hot environment because we possess
<br>
a powerful theory that says that the temperature won't really be disabling.
<br>
<p>Our minds must also strive to achieve ever greater control over their
<br>
disparate parts.  One friend of mine is having his life destroyed by
<br>
his &quot;moodiness&quot; or, and he and I say, by his lack of integrity.  In
<br>
this context, of course, the term &quot;integrity&quot; means wholeness.  His
<br>
life is unraveling just because he has no control over what he wants
<br>
on significant issues, and the inconsistencies (he says) drive to despair
<br>
the people closest to him.  I wish to have greater control over my own
<br>
tendency to over-react.  I wish to have greater control over my moods
<br>
(when I want to work and when I want to play).  And the list goes on
<br>
and on.  Which is one reason that the future beckons so brightly.
