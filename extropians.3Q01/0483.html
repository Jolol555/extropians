<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would also point out, once again, that a believe it is

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; implications, you would demean others who believe something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this is possible on different grounds than you do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't see how this says anything about what I was speaking of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If the essence of you can be not only preserved but uploaded and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; partially or wholly downloaded into other bodies then this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very much like the notion of a &quot;soul&quot; that inhabits this body and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that can survive the end of this body.  It is a technological means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by which this old dream/vision/wish can be made real.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point is that &quot;soul&quot; is probably the most famous of all the suitcase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms.  I once proposed that it should be dissected, at least, into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;immortal soul&quot;, &quot;extraphysical soul&quot;, &quot;weird-physics neurology&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;morally-valent soul&quot; (atomic game-theoretical unit of moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility; &quot;free will&quot;), &quot;qualia&quot;, &quot;mind-state preservation&quot;, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;self-continuity&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough but dissection is only one of the useful operations
<br>
on any concept/symbol.  Dissection into parts or a list of
<br>
things covered is also not necessarily sufficient to understand
<br>
a whole.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The issues involved on uploading bear on mind-state preservation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-continuity, qualia, and possibly weird-physics neurology.  It would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be both unjustified and sloppy to, by importing the suitcase term &quot;soul&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflate the postulation of extraphysical immortality and religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgement with the idea of technological transference of self-continuity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of an informational pattern to a new substrate.  Essentially the 
</em><br>
<p>What does judgement have to do with anything?  The term &quot;soul&quot;
<br>
does not necessarily imply judgement at all as witness many of
<br>
the world's major religions.  You are conflating the term with
<br>
some other notions here.  What is not &quot;extraphysical&quot; about
<br>
being stored as a pattern of information in some fairly rarefied
<br>
computational matrix?  Just because religion and spirituality is
<br>
often portrayed as if it excludes all physicality does not mean
<br>
it does so or need do so.  And just what is this matter stuff
<br>
anyway?  Increasingly it is pretty tenuous as far as we can
<br>
tell.  Where mind/consciousness/observer ends and
<br>
matter/observed begins is a bit of a sticky question.  It will
<br>
not be greatly clarified when mind/consciousness gains nanotech
<br>
enabled ability to control matter on a very fine basis.   It
<br>
will become even less clear when we consciously inhabit
<br>
cyber-worlds.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue of pattern continuity versus material continuity is raised by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; molecular replacement in the human body.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I tend to be confident about my ability to handle what goes on in my head,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; but I don't mess with social group polarization, I don't mess with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; attaching moral valency to predictions (learned that the hard way), and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; don't mess with religious analogies.  I tend to regard these things as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; cognitive equivalent of sticking your head in a microwave oven.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I tend to regard disowning hard questions using absurd analogies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as the equivalent of sticking your head in the oven and lighting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a match. &lt;g&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not disowning the hard questions, but yes, I am suggesting that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should give absolutely no a-priori confidence to past attempts at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answering them; if there are any relevant ideas they should be considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a case-by-case basis rather than as part of a category.  Current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience has shown (a) that past ideas are usually wrong and (b) that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people have a tendency to become sentimentally attached to past ideas.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would therefore argue either for complete neutrality (if confident of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality) or the use of a small corrective bias against ideas to which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you fear you may have become sentimentally attached (meta-rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correction for estimates of self-fallibility).
</em><br>
<p><p>This sounds perfectly reasonable.  Especially applied to all
<br>
one's ideational/belief context.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think that anything is gained by dragging soulism into this and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am not inclined to grant it the benefit of the doubt.
</em><br>
<p>I think continuity with the rest of the human enterprise is
<br>
something that makes it quite worth exploring points of
<br>
similarity to religions and religious ideas.   It is difficult
<br>
to believe that we have broken into the clear where all former
<br>
notions can be discarded.  Sure we should examine carefully
<br>
though.   
<br>
<p>But I question whether we are the type of beings who can or even
<br>
should attempt to release all our &quot;sentimentality&quot; though.  A
<br>
&quot;sentimental&quot; attachment to ending suffering and acheiving
<br>
greater and more abundant life is at the heart of much that we
<br>
do here.  Perhaps a dissection of &quot;sentimental&quot; or a
<br>
clarification of what is and isn't meant is in order.
