<p>
The notion of outloading an uploaded mind may sound
<br>
like retrograde technology in a sense, but perhaps not.
<br>
Reminder: outloading is where nanomachines ride along
<br>
with a developing human embryo and arrange the developing
<br>
neurons and interconnections in such a way that the infant
<br>
is born with certain brain structures already in place, so it
<br>
would be born knowing some things as if by instinct.
<br>
<p>Envision a post-singularity universe where the uploaded
<br>
minds can do all the things we would expect: they calculate
<br>
all manner of awe-inspiring things, play chess like demons,
<br>
arrange knowledge in new and wonderful ways.
<br>
<p>But suppose we don't have the process perfected.  Suppose
<br>
uploaded minds do not laugh and do not weep?  Suppose the
<br>
uploads discover they do not fall in love?  Then suppose they
<br>
want to.  Outloading would be an attempt by a mechanical
<br>
mind to create a mortal flesh-world analog of itself, completely
<br>
non-destructively.  It doesn't harm the upload to have an
<br>
outload of itself in existence, eh?  The outloaded mind would
<br>
serve as a content provider, to help the uploaded mind try
<br>
to understand those mysterious feelings we humans get.
<br>
<p>Remember the last time you developed a wild crush on another
<br>
person?  Perhaps you didn't even know why.  She [or he] just
<br>
did it to you for some strange reason, she simply knew how to
<br>
tweak your knobs, she caused your testosterometer to peg.
<br>
You may have behaved in odd ways that you yourself did
<br>
not understand.  I can easily imagine an uploaded mind
<br>
missing that feeling, discovering that it couldnt go there, and
<br>
wanting to.  spike
