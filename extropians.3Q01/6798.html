<em>&gt;&gt; One thing I have not seen mentioned by anyone is insurance.  All of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; insurance policies I have seen specifically exclude war and acts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; terrorism.  As far as I know, none of the damage is covered by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; insurance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; none of the equipment or losses will be reimbursed, and none of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; insurance policies will be honored.  Does anybody have more specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; information about the insurance industry's response to this?
</em><br>
<p>During times of WAR casino's remain open and honor winnings. Casino's 
<br>
have always provided better policies, ethics and payouts than insurance 
<br>
companies so you're better off gambling with a casino than an insurance 
<br>
company.
<br>
<p>I've never understood why people find it unusual that insurance 
<br>
companies won't honor anything that they don't feel like at the time. 
<br>
When you pay someone because you're scared (ie. blackmail, protection 
<br>
money, insurance) you'd have to be a complete moron to believe the 
<br>
people you're giving it to have your interests at heart.
<br>
<p>Next time an insurance salesscum drops by your house tell him: &quot;Have I 
<br>
got a deal for you! If you give me money every day and I get robbed, 
<br>
I'll assess what I want to replace and take case of it myself... What do 
<br>
you mean that's stupid... what deal are you offering me?&quot;
