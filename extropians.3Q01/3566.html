<p>So here is the challenge: suppose we wish to design a college
<br>
admissions test that would *not* favor one subset of the above
<br>
any other.  The design constraints are as follows:
<br>
<p>1.  The test must be performed in a single day.
<br>
<p>2.  The test must not require a test administrator to assist
<br>
the test takers in any way.
<br>
<p>3.  The test scoring must be completely objective, i.e, no
<br>
judges or subjective anything.
<br>
<p>4.  The test must scorable by machine.
<br>
<p>Under these design constraints, what would the test
<br>
look like?  Would it not look a lot like the SAT?
<br>
If the blame for uneven scoring is put on differing
<br>
reading skills, is there in theory any way to design
<br>
a legitimate test that does away with reading?  These
<br>
are important questions, for Taxifornia is struggling to
<br>
do away with the SAT, claiming that it unfairly favors
<br>
a subgroup.  They have moved to replace it with a test
<br>
that includes a foreign language.  This improves the
<br>
scores of those who grow up hearing Spanish in the
<br>
home for instance, but further reduces the scores of
<br>
the poor scorers which have no foreign language skills.
<br>
How can colleges legitimately measure and select the
<br>
smartest?  Can they?  spike
