<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;It occurs to me that the experiences of quadriplegics 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;may provide some information... 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; There is quite a good book on this very topic written by Wendy Seymour, Its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called Remaking the Body (Routledge) and is an ethnographic study of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quadraplegics and how they have had to redefine their self to cope with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spinal injury and its effects. It's a good read and shows clearly how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's sense of self is intimately connected with one's body. When these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people lost particular abilities and functions, they had to reevaluate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their selfs, both in the way they now saw themsleves, and how others saw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them. 
</em><br>
<p>Good, this is choice information.  I would next like to know
<br>
if they in retrospect considered the transformation into a 
<br>
quadraplegic to be a form of death.  My prediction would be
<br>
that they'd answer &quot;no&quot;, no more than a rascally teen might
<br>
say of his induction into boot camp; just a strange transformation,
<br>
but not a real threat to existence or identity.  But I could be wrong.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Something that hasn't been mentioned particularly is the importance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other people to our sense of self. We define who we by what we look like,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we do, from experience and from our interactions with others -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modifying our bodies will obviously have a profound effect on our sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self, not just becuase of how we know we look and feel, but others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions are also important to us. Some may say that they don't care what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others think....but I think the majority of us do...maybe not.
</em><br>
<p>Evidently some of us will be more affected than others by changes
<br>
in what we look like.  I suggest that we consult the very elderly
<br>
on this matter, who no longer resemble themselves at age 20 at all.
<br>
Moreover, they now have much differently functioning bodies.
<br>
<p>However, again, my personal experience suggests that far from 
<br>
thinking that their selfs have changed, they regard themselves
<br>
as being trapped in strangely old and non-functioning bodies.
<br>
At least that's what my father said; and at age 53, that's the
<br>
way it's starting to seem to me too.  One is reminded of the
<br>
obese person who shrieked, &quot;Help!  I am a thin person trapped
<br>
in this enormous fat body.  Someone must help me!&quot;.
<br>
<p>If I am correct in the above paragraphs, then the next question
<br>
must arise for me and those who agree with me, is, where are
<br>
people getting all these strange ideas about body image?  Has
<br>
something in our culture recently changed?
