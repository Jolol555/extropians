<em>&gt; Now, what is the point of trying to define racism as genetic?  If I were to
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No, we would not pre-judge blacks as being de facto posessors of
<br>
characteristics which predominate a racial culture. We would say they
<br>
have a given probability, if no other factors are taken into account, of
<br>
having those characteristics typical of the culture (not race) to which
<br>
they belong. Since most people never make a judgement about an
<br>
individual solely on a single prejudicial factor like that (and they
<br>
never make any decision without SOME prejudicial factors occuring,
<br>
racial or not in nature) we would merely adjust or weight a prejudicial
<br>
factor by how close to the norm the individual is. 
<br>
<p>For example, take someone like Colin Powell. While a few racist people
<br>
would be completely prejudicial about his blackness defining his total
<br>
character, most people who are normally less trustful of blacks than
<br>
whites (even most blacks) tend to trust someone like Powell because of
<br>
one or more of the following individual characteristics he has:
<br>
<p>a) he is a military veteran, decorated and high ranking
<br>
b) he speaks like an average american, with no slang or accent more
<br>
typical of an 'average' stereotypical American black person, and is
<br>
highly educated.
<br>
c) his exposure in the media to the public, as an individual
<br>
personality, engenders trust.
<br>
<p>Thus, despite the cultural probabilities, he has mitigated those by his
<br>
own individual actions and characteristics, just as ANY individual does
<br>
to attain personal achievement in life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where does this lead us?  Are we now free to practice racial prejudice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discrimination and profiling because it is not racist?  Should we start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluating people on the basis of racial groupings instead of individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merits?  Should any policy, strategy, law, or philosophy treat people of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different races differently?  Ignoring the terminology of whether these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions are &quot;racist&quot; or not, are you arguing that they represent good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science, good politics, good strategy?
</em><br>
<p>No. As I said before, if you were paying attention, is that
<br>
acknowledging actual cultural differences is a completely separate issue
<br>
from the moral/ethical aspect of taking action based on those
<br>
differences.
<br>
<p>This is EXACTLY like the issue of genetic screening by health insurers.
<br>
Does an insurer have the right to be biased against you in charging you
<br>
more for health insurace just because you have a genetic predisposition
<br>
toward certain ailments? In my opinion, they don't. Similarly, you
<br>
should not take actions to discriminate actively against a person solely
<br>
on the basis of the racial culture they belong to to one degree or
<br>
another. Acknowledging cultural difference is okay. Acting in a way to
<br>
help positively mitigate negative differences, without negatively
<br>
impacting others, is okay. Acting in an unequal negative manner toward
<br>
someone due to cultural differences is not.
