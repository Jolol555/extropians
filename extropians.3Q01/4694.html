</em><br>
<p>Beleive it. The literacy rate here in the US has gone down markedly
<br>
since the institution of widespread public education, and especially
<br>
since the institution of Departments of Education in our universities as
<br>
academic disciplines in their own right. They've taken a discipline that
<br>
has worked very well for thousands of years and destroyed it in a
<br>
century.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I doubt that the situation in UK is much different to Oz. I know a number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of public school teachers and they work incredibly hard.
</em><br>
<p>But they don't work very smart. I frankly find it rather indicative that
<br>
teachers, as a profession requiring a four year degree, has the lowest
<br>
average SAT scores in its practitioners of all such professions, AND
<br>
teachers seem to be the ones who protest the loudest that IQ doesn't
<br>
mean anything.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A while ago there were some truly stupid &quot;surveys&quot; done here in Oz in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempt to &quot;prove&quot; that kids here are illiterate. They came up with figures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the conservatives used to do a lot of chest thumping, but it really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasn't true. All the kids I have met are bright as buttons. I wish that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I was their age I had learned some of the things these kids are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning now.
</em><br>
<p>Kids may be bright, but that doesn't make them literate. They need to
<br>
learn literacy no matter how bright they are. It's not genetic to come
<br>
out of the womb literate. The difference between my own education and
<br>
kids of today is noticable, and I'm not that old.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to be fashionable to heap shit on public schools these days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Not on schools alone. Parents are at least as much to blame, but then,
<br>
they have to work two full time jobs today in order to live under a
<br>
system that confiscates nearly half of their productive output. Back in
<br>
the day when taxation was far more fair, and were nearly non-existent
<br>
when wars were not in evidence, a family could afford to have only one
<br>
parent working, and one staying home.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It makes me feel sad that some people feel so unconcerned at the thought of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wiping away a whole segment of society. Don't they remember why public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school exists? There is this waving of arms and saying &quot;Leave it to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magic of the free market -- that will fix it.&quot; But all it will fix is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rich will have less tax to pay and the poor will go without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education... and backwards we march to the bad old days.
</em><br>
<p>Even in those days, the poorest who dropped out of school typically did
<br>
so with an education gained by the 6th grade that is roughly equivalent
<br>
to the sort of education our teachers empart to our kids today by the
<br>
12th grade. Nor do those who are destined for non-degree jobs need to be
<br>
able to quote Dostoyevsky or Homer. One of the big problems with
<br>
education today is that vocational training has been removed from many
<br>
high schools, it is treated as a post-secondary educational course, when
<br>
prior to public education, kids could drop out of high school with more
<br>
skills as machinists or draftsmen than many vocational graduates today.
<br>
Not every kid needs a college prep education, but teachers seem to think
<br>
they do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am no fan of school (I was lucky enough to be born into a family where I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was well-off and basically taught myself), but that doesn't mean I am blind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to how it can bring opportunity to those who would otherwise miss out. Sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school can improve... it can *always* improve. But next time you feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tempted to dump on public school just have a look at what they *are*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; managing to teach kids these days.
</em><br>
<p>Pretty much nothing but how to be a social darwinist with cliquism,
<br>
brand name awareness, and an ability to recognise that evolution and
<br>
creationism are allegedly equivalent theories....
