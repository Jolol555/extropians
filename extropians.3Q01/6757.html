</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The single most effective way to unite the Afghan people behind the
<br>
Taliban would be to support or invite a Russian invasion. The
<br>
next-best way would be to support or invite an Iranian invasion.
<br>
An action originating in Pakistan against bin Laden and the Taliban
<br>
would probably be in Pakistan's interest and is likely to be supported
<br>
by the Afghan people.
<br>
<p>Also, the last thing the Russians need internally is a fight with
<br>
another bunch of Muslims. They are already in a mess in Chechnia.
<br>
<p>I really, really hope our objective is to crush the pan-islamic
<br>
terrorist movement and its supporters. That's bin Laden, al-queda,
<br>
and a whole bunch of folks in a whole bunch of countries that have
<br>
supported them. The Taliban is one bunch of such people. The Afghan
<br>
people as a whole apparently are not. I'd guess that our best move
<br>
is to work through Pakistan, and Pakistan appears to be about to help.
<br>
I strongly suspect that Pakistan is willing to help because Pakistan's
<br>
prior help for bin Laden and the Taliban will otherwise blow up in
<br>
their face. As I understand it, al-Queda's single largest current
<br>
activity is supporting the islamic kashmiris against India on the
<br>
disputed border between India and Pakistan. Pakistan has really good
<br>
reasons to help us in Afghanistan in order to keep us from noticing
<br>
Kashmir.
