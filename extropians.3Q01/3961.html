<p>OK, I guess this discussion is over.  You made a lot of good points in your
<br>
post (which I conveniently snipped :-).  I don't have time or inclination to
<br>
discard the dictionary and debate new meanings for words.
<br>
<p>I think we are agreed on what your definition is, what my definition is, and
<br>
what the dictionary's dictionary is.  I don't think there is much value in
<br>
going further on that track.
<br>
<p>I think we have wasted too much time on this.  Let's assume that I concede
<br>
your definition for the sake of argument.
<br>
<p>Now, what is the point of trying to define racism as genetic?  If I were to
<br>
concede to your definition, what purpose would it serve?  Under your
<br>
definition, we can now pre-judge blacks as having characteristics because of
<br>
their race.  It would not be racist under your definition because it is not
<br>
genetically based.  Under your definition, we can no discriminate blacks by
<br>
reference to their race.  It would not be racist under your definition
<br>
because it is not genetically based.
<br>
<p>Where does this lead us?  Are we now free to practice racial prejudice,
<br>
discrimination and profiling because it is not racist?  Should we start
<br>
evaluating people on the basis of racial groupings instead of individual
<br>
merits?  Should any policy, strategy, law, or philosophy treat people of
<br>
different races differently?  Ignoring the terminology of whether these
<br>
actions are &quot;racist&quot; or not, are you arguing that they represent good
<br>
science, good politics, good strategy?
