<em>&gt; Any potential John Galts out there are politely requested to wait on their

<p>Sounds like you need to replace John Galt with John Koza.

Creative computer can invent to order
<br>
William Peakin
<br>
<p>SCIENTISTS have built an &quot;intelligent&quot; computer that may soon be able
<br>
to invent and design products of its own.
<br>
<p>In recent tests the machine has come up with designs for hi-fi
<br>
equipment, cruise control systems and electrical circuits which are
<br>
close to those designed and patented by humans but which the machine
<br>
produced in a fraction of the time. In one case it recreated in just
<br>
three days a chip-based radio tuner that was patented by IBM last
<br>
April after months of development.
<br>
<p>The computer's designers intend to get it to solve problems for which
<br>
answers have yet to be found. The aim is to create an &quot;invention
<br>
machine&quot; that after being set a specific task will design the solution
<br>
without further human intervention.
<br>
<p>The computer's creator John Koza, a consulting professor in medicine
<br>
and electrical engineering at Stanford University, California, has
<br>
called the machine GP after the special form of &quot;genetic programming&quot;
<br>
it uses. &quot;It uses the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest
<br>
to produce and then sift through new ideas or solutions,&quot; Koza said.
<br>
<p>Conventional computers calculate their answers using a set of
<br>
instructions fed into them by humans. GP, by contrast, mimics nature.
<br>
It is fed thousands of sets of instructions - which are akin to the
<br>
genetic codes contained in DNA - in the form of randomly generated
<br>
computer programs. Provided only with its goal, to design a radio
<br>
tuner for example, it breeds and cross-breeds these programs thousands
<br>
of times until they yield a solution.
<br>
<p>The development brings the world a step closer to fulfilling the
<br>
prophecy of Alan Turing, the British mathematician whose early
<br>
computers helped break the Germans' Enigma code in the second world
<br>
war. Turing believed machines would one day acquire artificial
<br>
intelligence rivalling the abilities of humans.
<br>
<p>He suggested that artificial intelligence could occur through a
<br>
&quot;cultural search&quot; whereby a computer would learn everything there is
<br>
to know in the world.
<br>
<p>Wising up: computers are creeping closer to the condition of the
<br>
intelligent robots of AI
<br>
<p>Turing believed another route to artificial intelligence was
<br>
&quot;genetical evolution&quot;. This is similar to the Steven Spielberg film AI
<br>
Artificial Intelligence, to be released in Britain in September, in
<br>
which the main character is a robot designed as a substitute child for
<br>
infertile couples. After being abandoned, the robot meets Gigolo Joe,
<br>
a robotic version of a male escort played by Jude Law.
<br>
<p>Evolution is also the path chosen by Koza, who has tested his computer
<br>
by pitching it against some of the biggest technological breakthroughs
<br>
of the past 100 years to see if it can duplicate or infringe
<br>
inventors' patents. So far it has succeeded in infringing more than 20
<br>
key patents. &quot;We give it a piece of wire - the embryo - and 400,000
<br>
sets of instructions - the primordial stew that would be used in
<br>
creating something,&quot; said Koza. &quot;We tell it what we want and run the
<br>
program. It's magical to watch it invent something in a few days that
<br>
probably took someone several years.&quot;
<br>
<p>In separate experiments scientists at Southampton University used a
<br>
similar program to redesign a girder built by Nasa for an experiment
<br>
on the space shuttle.
