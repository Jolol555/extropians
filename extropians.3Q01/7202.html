<p>####How about using high-level manipulation of the picture (before
<br>
compression) - e.g bending blades of grass, shifting the shape of clouds,
<br>
done with a graphics program. Such modifications would not (if skillfully
<br>
done) produce statistical aberrations at the level where compression occurs.
<br>
By comparing the modified picture to an unmodified original (initially
<br>
transmitted by a secure channel - a courier with CD-ROM) you could read the
<br>
message, according to some predefined rules.

<p>If you did not PGP encode the string which told the positions in the
picture where the desired objects were found, it would be a variation
on a book cipher.  In the old days the spy and his home base would share
a book, and send messages which were the positions of the desired words
in the book.  You have done the same thing with a picture.
<p>### At last I know the name of this trick (which I reinvented when I was
musing about unbreakable codes).
<p>With a CD-ROM of pictures and the high-level modifications this (call it the
wedding-album cipher ;-) ), would be not only unbreakable but also
undetectable.

<p>Based on the above, there is no way the governement could prevent terrorists
from communicating, short of physically destroying the Internet. And yet 72%
of the (so uninformed) public opinion apparently believe encryption controls
could help detect the evil ones. 
<p>It's so sad that so many people think so little and do so much.
