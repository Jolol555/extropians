</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think I'm proposing something different to James, which is that I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the public school system should probably be privatised, while government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding remains intact. But what we are both saying is that the decision to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fund only a single style of school, &quot;public schools&quot;, makes it very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult for alternatives to exist, unless the target market of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternatives are not sensitive to price (or in fact use the price as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; status symbol). 
</em><br>
<p><p>I find this perfectly acceptable, actually; I wasn't really proposing
<br>
anything.  When you consider that most good private schools spend far less
<br>
than the ~$10,000 per student that the government does in many places, I
<br>
would be delighted to see private institutions vying for the opportunity to
<br>
get that same amount of money to teach children.  With this kind of profit
<br>
at stake, private schools would be falling all over themselves trying to
<br>
find ways to encourage parents to send children to their schools.
<br>
<p>It would fix the absurd situation where what private schools would classify
<br>
as &quot;obscenely profitable&quot;, government schools classify as &quot;underfunded&quot;.
