<em>&gt;                    -- men (9%) than for women (1.1%) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                    -- blacks (16.2%) and Hispanics (9.4%) than for whites
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(2.5%) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Based on current rates of first incarceration, an estimated 28% of black
</em><br>
<em>&gt;males will enter State or Federal prison during their lifetime, compared to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;16% of Hispanic males and 4.4% of white males.

<em>&gt;Blacks: % of U.S. population	12
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Whites: % of U.S. population	74

and then commented:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this information, If I were to posit that &quot;Blacks commit WAY more crimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than Whites.&quot; Would that be a racist statement?  And If so, why?
</em><br>
<p>It would certainly be a non-sequitur, unless you think that everyone who
<br>
commits a crime goes to jail, or even that the same proportions hold among
<br>
those committing crimes, those caught and charged, and those who serve
<br>
time. Is it just possible that proportionately more rich or middleclass
<br>
whites get away with more crime, violent and otherwise, than poor blacks
<br>
(or poor whites)?
<br>
<p>The figures above suggest that a statistical black has 40 times as many
<br>
chances as a statistical white of committing a crime leading to a prison
<br>
sentence. (Many of those, of course, being `victimless' drug crimes.) Is
<br>
the racism of US society such that this disproportion results from
<br>
differential levels of pursuit, prosecution, defense and sentencing? Some
<br>
of it, surely; presumably not all. But then that's hardly surprising. The
<br>
racist heritage of the nation plainly conduces to crime becoming a viable
<br>
profession among black Americans (as among wretched poor and culturally
<br>
suppressed British and Irish whites in the 17th and 18th centuries);
<br>
addictions to neurotoxic drugs probably impairs the impulse control of a
<br>
lot of poor and desperate and already fucked up people. Those are not
<br>
racist observations, in my view; they're a tragic acknowledgement of past
<br>
and present injustices. What's to be done? I wouldn't go asking Fred Reed
<br>
for any pointers.
