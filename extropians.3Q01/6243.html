<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 47'th update of my fly longevity experiments. All bottles
<br>
except those with vinegar contain 1/4 tsp citric acid as a standard
<br>
additive. Here I examine elderberry juice again, as well it's major
<br>
components such as apple and grape juice. Balsalmic vinegar is made from
<br>
grape juice.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in Run #36 freeze concentrated elderberry juice greatly increased
<br>
average longevity from 40 days (control) to about 80 days. Maximum
<br>
survival increased from 73 days (control) to a record 118 days. The
<br>
current experiment was done in the summer, and average temperature had
<br>
increased to about 25.5 C. Higher temperatures are known to accelerate
<br>
motor neuron disease in flies, but also may greatly increase the
<br>
confounding effect of viral infections.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balsalmic vinegar turned out to be a dud this time, but my failure to
<br>
add extra potassium to counter the potassium depleting effect of acetic
<br>
acid may have biased the result.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few flies in my recent experiments lost the ability to fly before
<br>
perishing. In is interesting that at the day 49 census the surviving 32%
<br>
of flies in the freeze concentrated elderberry juice bottle had ALL lost
<br>
their ability to fly. This strongly suggested that this concentrated juice
<br>
was successful in blocking many of the pathogen associated deaths. At the
<br>
day 54 census the surviving 21% had even lost the ability to walk. These
<br>
extremely decrepit flies could barely move even when the bottle was
<br>
greatly agitated. Under magnification they exhibited only slight signs of
<br>
movement. They were literally on their last legs.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reluctant to make freeze concentrated elderberry juice a standard
<br>
additive to all my bottles because the colour it imparts to the fly food
<br>
makes a census difficult. Therfore I will continue to look for other
<br>
additives that are effective in allowing flies to live long enough to die
<br>
of motor neuron diease. In my next experiment I look at the effect of
<br>
removing all dead fly corpses from bottles at each census.
<br>
<p>Note: Below FC means freeze concentrated.
