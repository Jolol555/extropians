<em>&gt;   Bums in the street would vanish, because begging is a harder way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquire funds, than working a job. Crime would plummet, because in the
</em><br>
<p>Reality disconnect: most panhandlers have made a very educated decision to
<br>
remain panhandlers, because they make more money that way than they would in
<br>
any job they are qualified to be hired for (== minimum wage or near minimum
<br>
wage). A good panhandler can clear $50-80/day in tax-free money in cities in
<br>
which there isn't so much competition in the panhandling ecosystem (such as
<br>
Houston, TX, or New Orleans, LA, to name two examples in which I've known
<br>
people who panhandled). Here in San Francisco, the competition is way more
<br>
Darwinian; there's quite an arms race, and any human front to the
<br>
pandhandlers that you're likely to see has been subsumed by the tricks and
<br>
falsehoods necessary to compete for dollars. As a consequence of that, I
<br>
don't know anyone here who does this for a living, so can't speak to the
<br>
income.
<br>
<p>But anyway, back to the point: most of these people have made a sensible,
<br>
informed capitalist decision to do what they do. Don't insult their
<br>
intelligence.
