Hi Barbara,

<p>You are changing the meaning of my the question  :-)  You had used yourself
<br>
as an illustration, and now you're back to talking about other people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and there's no one around to help. I could give a number of examples, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's difficult to believe you've lived such a sheltered life that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't realize that sometimes people simply don't have enough resources.
</em><br>
<p>Of course I've seen that.  There's no arguing that many people are
<br>
in real need.  In fact, don't forget about all the rest of the
<br>
people in the world, not just in your society and mine.  Who's going
<br>
to see to it that the people of India have enough food and clothing?
<br>
Even next door in Mexico, there are some unbelievably poor people
<br>
(especially in Mexico city), and it does indeed seem unfair that
<br>
rich people here like Bill Gates have so much money, and the starving
<br>
of Mexico City have so little.  Those poor people need Gates' money
<br>
much, much more than he does.  You might favor a world government
<br>
that would rectify this situation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's right, but I like the idea of minimizing suffering where possible. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't consider suffering particularly beautiful or noble. I've been through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough of it personally to know that it sucks.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry to say this, but I don't find such comments helpful.  Can
<br>
you not suppose that I too, and many other people with whom you 
<br>
disagree, are extreme opponents of suffering?  You even go so far
<br>
as to imply (by comparison) that other people do consider suffering
<br>
&quot;beautiful or noble&quot;.  If you are really serious about what should
<br>
be done about suffering, please read David Pearce's &quot;The Hedonistic
<br>
Imerative&quot; (don't be put off by the title) at www.hedweb.com   It's
<br>
constituted the most important moral revolution in my life since
<br>
I became a cryonicist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But theoretically, yes, I'd like to live in a world where every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person was guaranteed basic food, shelter, and medical care.
</em><br>
<p>So would we all.  It's frankly a question of how high a price
<br>
we have to pay, whether it would work, and whose rights we have
<br>
to trample on to get there.
<br>
<p>Lee
