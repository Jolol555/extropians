<p>AHOOGA! AHOOGA! Groupthink warning!
<br>
<p>It has been considered here on this list and in Extropy, perhaps in a
<br>
few sf novels, but thats it. It is 'well accepted' by a very small group
<br>
of people, who of course spend much time talking to each other. So to
<br>
them it seems that many more people hold that view than really do. 
<br>
<p>If you ask a representative cross section of (say) american citizens or
<br>
intellectuals about the scenario, you will get mainly blank stares,
<br>
quite a few laughs and some explaining to you that it must be wrong
<br>
because computers cannot think or similar arguments. To most people a
<br>
future just like today but with a few more toys is a well accepted
<br>
scenario, anything else is out.
<br>
<p>Basing one's interactions with the public on what one believes to be
<br>
rational or likely rather than what *they* consider to be rational and
<br>
likely (even if you think they are utterly wrong) will simply not work.
<br>
To communicate you need to understand how to express things in other
<br>
people's realities.
