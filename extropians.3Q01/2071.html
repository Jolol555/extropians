<em>&gt;Carlos,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       Is it okay to address you as Carlos or do you prefer &quot;C&quot; as you sign 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yourself that way?
</em><br>
<p>Ah, that's just a (bad?) habit of signing off my e-mails. Sorry if it
<br>
is bothersome and address me as Carlos of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;       Please allow me to nit pick or quibble with your conclusions.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe if you read The Bell Curve by Herrnstein and Murray you will find out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they contend that another force is at play.  Our world wide economy is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increasingly high tech and pays a premium for excellence and intelligence.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think you will find much the same conclusions in The Lexus and the Olive Tree 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;although the author may lean more toward excellence that intelligence.  In 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;addition, Richard Epstein the Dean of the University of Chicago's School of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Law argues that we must simplify the law so the underclass can once again 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;under stand the law and take their position in society knowing they are both 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fitting in and being respected.  Perhaps I under simplify but as this is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussion I am sure someone will straighten me out if I am wrong -- and I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be thankful.
</em><br>
<p>And I agree heartily with what you say. All I've been trying to carry through
<br>
with my last e-mails can be boiled down to this: the Argentine political and
<br>
business class misused, bungled and wasted the chance they had during the
<br>
past 10 years to let the market forces and privatizations put our country
<br>
on the right path. The rich have grown richer, the poor poorer, the security
<br>
forces utterly corrupt, and the politicians and unions fossilized in ideas
<br>
and programs that are ridiculously hopeless. The local oligarchy gladly
<br>
joined the looting, twisting the market process to their own benefits,
<br>
piggybacking the Menem administration's shameless plunders. I'm all for
<br>
free markets and global economy. My only serious complaint to the
<br>
free markets and global economy actors is they were and are utterly naive
<br>
if they thought our local establishment wasn't going to shove the cost of
<br>
the transition to the lower classes and the public state, all the while
<br>
using the process to gain an even stronger hold on the country's economy
<br>
and politics. My fear is that the chance has been really wasted by now,
<br>
and we will face long years of stagnation and petty miseries before any
<br>
of the benefits of modernization and technology actually affect the bigger
<br>
part of our population instead of the self-anointed few.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;       But none of the above is intended to contradict what you are saying.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rather I am saying that if you are right then the poor are getting it from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;both ends of the stick.
</em><br>
<p>That is my impression in the case of Argentina, yes. As my knowledge of
<br>
other developing countries is not good enough, I can't say if this is
<br>
an exceptional case or a common phenomenon. Probably something in the middle,
<br>
though...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;       The practical difference between us is that I will argue that we have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be aware of both forces if we wish to improve the situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ron h.
</em><br>
<p>Well not really a difference. I'm aware of both forces, it's just that
<br>
the damage caused by the complete misuse of the free markets idea by the
<br>
local establishment overshadows anything else for now. I don't see my
<br>
country going anywhere until the establishment actually lets markets act
<br>
instead of just pretending they do.
