It appears as if Zero Powers &lt;<a href="mailto:zero_powers@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Enoughness,%20was%20Re:%20Vicious%20Racism&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108110653.IAA23834@color.sics.se&gt;">zero_powers@hotmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:

<p>In this day and age, when a human can change its physical appearance
<br>
as well as skin and hair colours, it seems rather irrelevant to have
<br>
a hang-up on any of these properties of any human, except for those
<br>
who lack the monetary means to change them, as they only can use the
<br>
builtin methods of creating a scion, and thus must consider the colour
<br>
information in their mates' genes (if they wish to exercise any control
<br>
over the colour of their scions, of course).
<br>
<p>Summary: Yawn.

Here at the HAL-2001 (Hackers At Large &lt;URL:<a href="http://www.hal2001.org/">http://www.hal2001.org/</a>&gt;),
<br>
Vaughan Bell &lt;<a href="mailto:vaughan@backspace.org?Subject=Re:%20Enoughness,%20was%20Re:%20Vicious%20Racism&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108110653.IAA23834@color.sics.se&gt;">vaughan@backspace.org</a>&gt; held yesterday a talk on &quot;Hacking
<br>
the Brain: From Reverse Engineerng to Optimisation&quot;. Slides available
<br>
at &lt;URL:<a href="http://delerium.spc.org/tha/HALTalk.sdd">http://delerium.spc.org/tha/HALTalk.sdd</a>&gt;.
<br>
<p>He concentrated on the input of glucose, oxygene, and B-vitamins to
<br>
optimise the cognitive circuits of the brain, after first introducing
<br>
the field of cognitive neuroscience.
<br>
<p>A 50g glucose drink increased the cognitive throughput after a delay
<br>
of 30 minutes, and panned out after approximately one hour.
<br>
<p>Oxygene 30s to one minute before learning something increased the
<br>
learning, but not the retrieval of the learned information.
<br>
<p>I believe the exact scientific references exist in the slides.
<br>
<p>Many Extropians would surely have felt much of the talk to been old hat,
<br>
but introduced the field nicely to newcomers.
<br>
<p>[Tech: This report comes to you from &lt;wireless-folk-34-14.campsite.hal2001.org&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comes to you via a wireless network connection (11 Mbps WaveLAN) and an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encrypted Kerberos telnet connection. Network congestion is rather low
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at this time (Saturday, August 11, 2001, 08:23:34 +0200).]
<br>
<p>[Weather: It has rained every day since we arrived here Monday, with sun now
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then. It becomes rather cold at 04-05 (in the morning) when you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;live in a tent, around here. Brr...]
<br>
<p>[Misc: I have seen one guy with wearable setup (LiquidImage M1 and Twiddler),
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and another with a wearable web camera on his head. Standard setup
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seems to be a laptop, and a number of traditional tower PCs and CRTs.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lots of folk pack various mobile hardware, phones and PDAs.]
<br>
<p>Cheers,
