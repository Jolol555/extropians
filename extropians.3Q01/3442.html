<p>While I can sympathize to some extent with anyone who feels that they
<br>
were denied a deserved place in the educational system, it seems like
<br>
focusing on this particular process (college admission/financial aid)
<br>
out of its social context is bound to make one feel cheated. It reminds
<br>
me of something from Tom Wolfe's &quot;The Right Stuff.&quot; In discussing the
<br>
original astronaut selection process, he proclaimed it to be totally
<br>
free of racial bias. Bull. The astronaut selection wasn't just what
<br>
happened in Houston. It is really our whole society, especially
<br>
educational and military institutions. Black candidates where diverted
<br>
long before they got the chance to fill out astronaut applications.
<br>
Likewise, the selection of black students based upon different criteria
<br>
makes perfect sense when one considers the vastly different experiences
<br>
that faced most black people as opposed to what whites encountered. Even
<br>
most relatively affluent black families can easily recount losses
<br>
attributable to prejudice and discrimination in our society. These tales
<br>
go back generations and only begin to trail off recently. So I have no
<br>
problem, considering that the aftershocks of these generations of
<br>
turmoil still echo through our society, with black students not always
<br>
being measured in the same way as whites. The recent thread on the
<br>
subject of IQ versus real world smarts  highlighted the problem with
<br>
measuring intelligence. It is not difficult for me to believe that
<br>
college admissions testing is substantially flawed in measuring a
<br>
students' merit. 
<br>
<p>But beyond any question of whites being cheated, let us return to the
<br>
position of blacks in colleges. What percentage of college admissions
<br>
are blacks taking? Is there any chance of blacks suddenly becoming
<br>
over-represented in student bodies? I don't think so. You'd probably
<br>
have to enroll twice as many black students before you achieved
<br>
proportionality with the general population. Complaints by whites that
<br>
they are unfairly excluded to benefit blacks would have much more merit
<br>
if there weren't so few blacks admitted to college to begin with. Whites
<br>
hardly seem the victims of &quot;institutional racism.&quot;
<br>
<p>I don't think there is any denying that society has systematically
<br>
denied much of the black population equal educational opportunities, as
<br>
well as the opportunity to fully enjoy the benefits of any education
<br>
that was achieved. I believe this is still being done today, the systems
<br>
that effected this discrimination being largely intact. But even if that
<br>
were not the case, the effects are still present. The legacy of this
<br>
discrimination lives on today not just in the decrepit and impoverished
<br>
inner city schools, but also in the absence of a strong tradition of
<br>
learning in some large segments of African-American society. Certainly
<br>
this fault cannot be corrected merely by attempts to recalibrate
<br>
entrance criteria, but such efforts certainly couldn't hurt. For any
<br>
whites that feel victimized by this effort to inject some equity, I'd
<br>
suggest taking a closer look at the big picture. Look at the entire
<br>
system and its history. Ask yourself if you can really say that history
<br>
doesn't matter, that whites as a race are at a disadvantage, and that an
<br>
SAT score is really the final determinant of what is fair. 
<br>
