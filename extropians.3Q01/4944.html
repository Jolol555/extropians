<em>&gt; Huh?  You have distorted the argument Mike.  What I said the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program indicated was that the IMF would *not* allow Jamaica
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to loan the money to its farmers at interest rates lower than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the IMF was charging.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, how will the Jamaican gov't raise the money to pay for the
<br>
difference in interest? Raise taxes?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I said *nothing* about &quot;social welfare&quot; programs unless you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider building hospitals or schools &quot;social welfare&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know precisely what the money was spent on, it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take a detailed investigation of Jamaican government budgets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to determine that.  There are certainly many cases where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the money most likely was spent in building palaces for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictators or dachas for the loan administrators.  However
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Jamaica's case the money may have been spent on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the police force to keep relative order with large numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of unemployed individuals as a result of the trade policies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I simply suggested hospitals or schools as infrastructure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects that 3rd world countries might construct in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort to uplift themsevles -- however the use of the funds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for such projects is problematic if it is going to force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to go back to the IMF for larger loans because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot repay the loans they already have.  If you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use the funds in ways that directly serve to increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your ability to repay the loans *during* the term of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loan, then it looks to me like you are screwed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A bank would get mighty pissed if I took out an auto loan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and used the money on a vacation to Fiji.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huh?  American banks are *more* than happy to lend you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money to take a vacation to Fiji.  They will even send
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you checks to do so that carry a 9.9% interest rate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They just assume you will pay it back and penalize you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you miss payments.
</em><br>
<p>But if I cannot demonstrate an *ability to pay* represented by *gainful
<br>
employment* or other accounts receivables, they will not loan me any
<br>
money for any reason. If I can make a business case that going to Fiji
<br>
is going to make me X amount of money, then they are far more likely to
<br>
loan me the money, and at a lower rate, than if I say &quot;I just lost my
<br>
job, have no savings, am already in debt, and I want to go on vacation.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now in the case of IMF &amp; Jamaica, it looks like coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the door, they are assuming it isn't going to get paid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back *and* try to arrange the loan conditions so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can't become competitive enough in world markets that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would have the income (presumably from taxes on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; banana producers) to repay the loan.
</em><br>
<p>Which is all evidence that the loan is structured in a way to force the
<br>
Jamaicans to refuse to borrow until they've paid down their existing
<br>
debt (which is at lower interest rates, btw).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't. I see it as &quot;You're not allowed to use this money on heroin, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; food stamps, but only on buying a car so you can get your ass to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; each day.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike, that isn't the case here.  If there are no jobs then it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't matter if you have a car or not.  If you want to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the case that Jamaica mis-spent the money on social welfare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs GO FIND SOME EVIDENCE FOR IT!
</em><br>
<p>The loans require that the Jamaicans buy manufactured goods from
<br>
industrialized countries with the loan money, which can include
<br>
industrial equipment, infrastructure building equipment (tractors,
<br>
cement plants, etc), etc., all of which can be used to increase Jamaican
<br>
GNP. The IMF has determined that the banana farms in Jamaica are at a
<br>
comparative disadvantage with other banana growing regions, and thus
<br>
have little hope of competing favorably in the future in that market.
<br>
Using loan policies that discourage Jamaicans from investing in losing
<br>
propositions is not a dumb idea. Granted that from a libertarian
<br>
perspective, it does seem to be the IMF doing a typical 'big brother'
<br>
&quot;We know what's best for you&quot; sort of paternalism, which can't help but
<br>
breed resentment, no matter how well intended it is, and irrespective of
<br>
whether the IMF actually knows what the hell it's talking about.
<br>
<p>The problem is the equation of the IMF with the US in the minds of third
<br>
worlders. I am of the opinion that the best thing we could do for our
<br>
long term reputation in the world is to kick the UN out of New York. We
<br>
are painted as guilty by association because the UN is based in the US.
<br>
Let some other country deal with the headaches and resentment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks to Charlie for filling in some of the pieces by providing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some &quot;data&quot; on how the situation has changed from his perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That suggests that &quot;non-free trade&quot;, i.e. of the type where presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the government and the people &quot;accepted&quot; an &quot;arranged&quot; trade situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (perhaps because the British felt it appropriate to &quot;repay&quot; some past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperialistic policies) is not, at least in this special instance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly objectionable.
</em><br>
<p>Of course not, especially when it is British subjects who own the
<br>
Jamaican banana plantations. It's more an extension of british
<br>
imperialism under the Commonwealth system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I notice that nobody seemed to comment on my comments about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather hefty increases in subsidies the U.S. farmers seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting now.
</em><br>
<p>Uh, as I just read in the paper, there was a $5 billion farm subsidy
<br>
bill just passed, most of which goes to cotton farmers, which actually
<br>
helps Jamaicans working in Jamaican clothing mills. The dems wanted a
<br>
$7.5 billion bill, most of which would go to corn farmers in Democrat
<br>
congressional districts, and Bush refused it.
