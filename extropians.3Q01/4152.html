<em>&gt;Yes, there are a certain, though limited number of examples where

</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I believe there is a wide variety of questions for which the benefits
<br>
of thinking in ways that your acquantances are comfortable with
<br>
exceed the benefits of searching for the truth. There are many issues
<br>
where my knowledge of the truth has virtually no effect on my fitness
<br>
(e.g. the death penalty, the number of angels who can fit on the tip
<br>
of a pin, and maybe even whether humans evolved from single-celled
<br>
organisms), except to the extent it can demonstrate my intelligence,
<br>
morality, etc. to other people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That would only work if you had some confidence or faith in those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who liked the other candidate.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Yes, if those people are behaving no better than random number generators,
<br>
then Robin's advice isn't useful. I don't think this is the case often
<br>
enough to be important.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  As an example, suppose that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do not believe in God, but wish to be as truth-seeking as possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It does not follow that you should &quot;move your beliefs in the direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of beliefs favored&quot; by those who are religious. 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I believe it normally does follow that you should do so (i.e. increase
<br>
your estimate of the probability that God exists).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You may have concluded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that they are simply out to lunch for some reason (explanation).
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Concluded that you can be certain they are &quot;out to lunch&quot;? Or merely that
<br>
they probably are?
<br>
&nbsp;If you mean probably, then Robin's analysis appears to imply that you
<br>
should believe there is some chance that they know something you don't,
<br>
and adjust your beliefs to acount for this chance.
<br>
&nbsp;If you are truly certain, then I would be very interested how you acquired
<br>
this certainty. Not just that many of them are &quot;out to lunch&quot;, but that the
<br>
best are.
