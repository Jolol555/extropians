<p><em>&gt; &gt;If it's a separate backup, then it isn't you -- it's a copy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you. Back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;suicide again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend consulting the archives (if they be working), this is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; recurring thread.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Such as: <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.4Q00/3644.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.4Q00/3644.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for the link to some of the relevant discussion in the archives. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appreciate it. Wow! There sure is a lot of it. I still haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it (already used up a lot of my day with it :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An odd thing though... all the stuff I read kept making, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seemed to me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a surprisingly simple mistake. You mention it again above: the idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the backup is a copy and is somehow distinct from a continuous &quot;genuine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you&quot;. The mistake is in thinking that we are continuous. We aren't. We
</em><br>
<p>There is a difference -- see below:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; exist in short, daily bursts. We lose consciousness each night -- more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often if we happen to drink to excess or have surgical operations or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receive traumatic blows to the head. There is no continuous me --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just the illusion of it maintained by my memories of what I did and felt
</em><br>
on the
<br>
<em>&gt; preceding day.
</em><br>
<p>Continuity is provided by association with the same body that you went to
<br>
sleep
<br>
in. Given the ephemeral nature of intelligence, you have to place the burden
<br>
of
<br>
continuity on the corpus.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If my biological self died in her sleep one night and next day my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downloaded self awoke, then in what way have I not continued? I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would still remember what went before in exactly the same way I do each
</em><br>
morning of my
<br>
<em>&gt; biological life.
</em><br>
<p>But it wouldn't be you -- it would be a copy of you; a separate person
<br>
associated with a different corpus who just happens to be very similar to
<br>
the (now extinct) you. [Corpus in this case can just as easily refer to the
<br>
specific memory hardware that an uploaded self is running on -- don't get me
<br>
started on how to kill an uploaded intelligence through use of the mv
<br>
command :)].
<br>
<p>I find belief in the indentity of two copies to be a risky hypothesis. It's
<br>
like a belief in an afterlife -- there's no verifiable way to prove that
<br>
that the essential you will continue if you peform some sort of radical
<br>
cut-and-paste operation like the one described above. The only way to see is
<br>
to try it -- which will either kill you or not. I'd much rather stick with
<br>
continuity through association with a given chunk of (slowly changing)
<br>
matter -- at least I know I'm not doing anything there that will wind up
<br>
causing me to cease to exist.
<br>
<p>--&gt; J. R. Molloy
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Inloading (and similar gently-gently techniques) mean that the patterns
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; data that are you never actually stop being physically identified with
</em><br>
one
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; distinct set of matter -- you're just extending that set. You will
</em><br>
change,
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but you won't cease to exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, that's the idea, and it closely parallels the process of ordinary,
</em><br>
normal
<br>
<em>&gt;human cognitive development, except that it extends that expansion to
</em><br>
include
<br>
<em>&gt;augmentation with machine intelligence, which is an entire new semiotic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system. The first research group that successfully demonstrates such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;learning technique can initiate the heralded evolutionary phase transition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Brain/machine interface still presents the greatest problem.
</em><br>
<p>So what do we all think about management of the expansion process? What
<br>
limits are there to throwing a bunch of extra material at a grown human
<br>
brain and seeing what results?
