We need a non-WTC story, so here:
<br>
<p>Cool star chills stellar theories
<br>
By Richard Stenger CNN
<br>
from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/09/10/cool.star/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/09/10/cool.star/index.html</a>
<br>
<p>(CNN) -- A star besieged by unbelievably hot waves of nuclear explosions is
<br>
ten times cooler than expected, forcing astronomers to rethink their ideas
<br>
about stellar physics.
<br>
<p>For more than a decade, the energy of billions of hydrogen bombs per second
<br>
battered a neutron star near the center of our galaxy.
<br>
<p>Months after the assault ended, an astrophysicist used the Chandra X-ray
<br>
Observatory to take the temperature of the beleaguered star, only to find
<br>
that it burned no hotter than nearby stars that escaped the energy
<br>
onslaught.
<br>
<p>&quot;Twelve years of constant thermonuclear explosions. One would think that
<br>
would heat things up,&quot; said Rudi Wijnands of the Massachusetts Institute of
<br>
Technology.
<br>
<p>&quot;This leaves us wondering whether some neutron stars are in the freezer for
<br>
a much longer time than previously thought ... or whether they cool down
<br>
incredibly fast.&quot;
<br>
<p>Neutron stars are the remnants of massive stars that explode in supernova.
<br>
The dying stars shed their outer layers while their interiors implode and
<br>
collapse into dense cores, which exert intense gravitational force.
<br>
<p>Like other neutron stars, this particular one, known as KS 1731-260, draws
<br>
gaseous material or fuel from a healthy companion star.
<br>
<p>The swirling material from the donor star collides into the neutron star,
<br>
setting off glowing explosions of intense X-ray energy.
<br>
<p>Such gas siphoning periods can last for weeks or years. Astronomers expected
<br>
KS 1731-260 to be particularly hot at the end of a 12-year episode, but it
<br>
turned out to be only about the same temperature as neutron stars that
<br>
consumed fuel from a neighbor for a week or month.
<br>
<p>Astronomers have few clues as to why. Perhaps the neutron star was in a deep
<br>
freeze for much longer than astronomers imagined.
<br>
<p>&quot;We may have identified a new type of neutron star system that can lie
<br>
dormant for thousands of years,&quot; said fellow MIT astronomer Walter Lewin.
<br>
<p>Wijnands announced his findings last week at a conference marking the second
<br>
anniversary of Chandra, the most powerful X-ray telescope in orbit.
