<p>Mike Lorrey commented:
<br>
<p>You are confusing extreme motivations (i.e. profound) with extreme
<br>
actions. Europeans do, in fact, get radically extreme maybe not over
<br>
silly things, but with silly solutions to profound problems: i.e.: a)
<br>
Crime is rising, so we need to disarm all the law abiding people, b)
<br>
Jews are prosperous business people and well educated and generally
<br>
smart, which contradicts our Odinist tradition of teutonic superiority,
<br>
so we need to kill them all to set things right, c) Serbs, Croats, and
<br>
Muslims are generally disagreeable people, so obviously they need to
<br>
kill each other off until there is no more disagreement, d) The US's
<br>
free market economy makes products more efficiently and cheaper than we
<br>
do, so obviously we need to shame and trick them into ratifying an
<br>
economy crippling 'Global Warming' treaty that we ourselves won't ratify
<br>
because we know it will REALLY cripple our socialist economies, e)
<br>
people tend to dislike oppressive, overbearing government, so obviously
<br>
we need to construct a nationwide surveillance system to keep an eye on
<br>
every citizen 24 hours a day.
<br>
<p>------------------------------------
<br>
<p>You should note that a &quot;nationwide surveillance system&quot; is probably
<br>
mooted
<br>
in the United Kingdom  but does not form a political goal of most
<br>
polities
<br>
within the European Union. Recently, the European Parliament recommended
<br>
that all corporate and private messages over the Internet should be
<br>
encrypted so that they could not be analysed by the Echelon system to
<br>
the
<br>
advantage of the US/Old Commonwealth intelligence network. If social
<br>
democratic and socialist parties within the European Union were focused
<br>
upon
<br>
overcoming a resistant populace by curbing their privacy, such a
<br>
recommendation would appear to be counterproductive.
<br>
<p>You are correct in pointing out that European countries have politicians
<br>
from the radical right and the post-communist left in both legislatures
<br>
and
<br>
government but the system of proportional representation used in these
<br>
countries would give a greater voice to these extremes. have you taken
<br>
this
<br>
into account?
<br>
<p>You also accuse the European powers of allowing the Balkan wars to
<br>
proceed
<br>
so that genocide and ethnic cleansing would provide a solution to these
<br>
regional problems. Certainly, the apathy of western states and the
<br>
disastrous recognition of Croatia by Germany exacerbated the break-up of
<br>
Yugoslavia but politicians are wary of committing their armies and
<br>
prospective casualties to an area from which they would derive little
<br>
electoral advantage. This was at the same time as the US deaths in
<br>
Somalia
<br>
and led all western governments to view the deployment of peacekeepers
<br>
with
<br>
horror.
<br>
<p>Your libertarian principles are worthy of support but you should strive
<br>
to
<br>
understand the peculiarities of the European nations, peoples and states
<br>
before making such broad brush comments which simplify very complex
<br>
associations. After all, I have to read commentary and listen to many
<br>
who
<br>
focus upon the deep ties between the United States and the United
<br>
Kingdom
<br>
when history demonstrates that the intellectual and educational culture
<br>
of
<br>
the US has probably been more deeply influenced by Germany. 'Special
<br>
Relationship' - an important political myth based upon invented
<br>
traditions.
