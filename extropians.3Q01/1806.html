</em><br>
<p>Not sure what you mean by 'ban,' but given that people naturally function in
<br>
groups, and that large-scale projects require the joint effort of hundreds
<br>
or thousands of people, would you not need, at a minimum, a constitution?
<br>
Surely the constitution would allow laws that 'ban' certain types of
<br>
behavior, such as stealing, murdering, fraudulently misrepresenting?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Any company may seek to purchase such liability protection from its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;insurance provider.
</em><br>
<p>This sort of liability protection is very different from the liability
<br>
protection granted by the state to corporate shareholders, limited partners,
<br>
members of limited liability companies, etc. Presumably, the insurance
<br>
company will pay the person wrongfully harmed, at least in some cases.
<br>
Futhermore, in cases where the insured shareholders' carrier didn't provide
<br>
adequate payment to the victim, the victim could seek recovery from the
<br>
shareholders themselves.
<br>
With state-granted limited liability, the victim is SOL. Even if he carries
<br>
his own insurance, his premium rates will go up when he files a claim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, I'm not sure what it means to say that they &quot;undermine free
</em><br>
markets&quot;.
<br>
<p>Okay, here's an example: I decide to start a business selling a diet aid
<br>
that consists of tapeworm eggs in a capsule. The diet is quite successful
<br>
over the first few months it's used by the consumer, and my business, which
<br>
I call Svelte Belt, does very well. I decide to bring in some investors so I
<br>
can expand the business. Because shareholders in a corporation have no
<br>
liability (beyond their investment in the corporation) for anything the
<br>
corporation does, I'm able to persuade many people to invest in Svelte Belt,
<br>
Inc. by showing them my p&amp;l statement for the first year. They have no real
<br>
need to examine my product closely, since all they stand to lose is their
<br>
investment. It's another year before the earlier users of Svelte Belt,
<br>
Inc.'s product begin experiencing health problems such as anemia. Several of
<br>
the pregnant users find that their babies' health has been affected by the
<br>
product. When they discover that Svelte Belt's product is actually tape worm
<br>
eggs, they sue the company. But meanwhile, many of the shareholders of
<br>
Svelte Belt have taken their gains on their Svelte Belt stock. Maybe I, as
<br>
director and officer of Svelte Belt, Inc. will be held liable; but then,
<br>
again, maybe not--it's pretty difficult to pierce the corporate veil.
<br>
<p>At the very least, this distorts the capital market, since absent limited
<br>
liability, companies such as Svelte Belt would not attract as many
<br>
investors. I'd predict that companies would tend to be smaller where
<br>
shareholders were responsible for the activities of their corporations.
<br>
Investors would want to personally know, or at least know about, the
<br>
corporate decision makers; would want to know in detail about the products
<br>
or services being sold.
<br>
<p>Of course, far greater damage is done to the free market when corporations
<br>
form &quot;partnerships&quot; with government. All too often that's what happens, but
<br>
one could presumably prevent that sort of situation, at least for a while,
<br>
by adhering to a properly drafted constitution. I say &quot;at least for a while&quot;
<br>
because in practice, whenever a small group of people controls a significant
<br>
per cent of the resources available to a population, the small group tends
<br>
to either collude with a government or to function as a government itself.
<br>
(by government, I mean a group of people exerting political power--that is
<br>
to say, power via force or the threat thereof--over the population as a
<br>
whole).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Someone who has proven exceptional skills at managing capital should be
</em><br>
given
<br>
<em>&gt;control of that capital.
</em><br>
<p>This is one of the problems of the perpetual duration aspect of the
<br>
corporation. The founder of a company may be very good at managing capital.
<br>
Her successors may be incompetent scoundrels. Well, okay, you might say,
<br>
then someone else who's a better manager will come along and compete with
<br>
the first corporation and drive it out of business. This won't always
<br>
happen, though, when the first corporation is already firmly established.
<br>
This would be an example of an economic law you might call &quot;those who have,
<br>
get.&quot; The companies that prosper aren't always the best--in fact they
<br>
usually aren't the best. Again, this problem is exacerbated by collusion
<br>
between corporations and governments, but I don't believe such collusion is
<br>
required in order for the &quot;those who have, get&quot; law to hold.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;Furthermore, I have yet to see anyone, still,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contest my assertions about the individual's right to the product of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their labor being the basis of capital accumulation
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how this is relevant to whether or not corporations are
<br>
desirable. Surely you'd want the individual's right to the product of their
<br>
labor to be bounded at the point where the individual's use of the product
<br>
of their labor is harmful to innocent people? If I send a not-so-good driver
<br>
out in my corporation's delivery truck, which happens to have badly worn
<br>
brake pads (due to the fact that my corporation's broke and doesn't have
<br>
enough money to pay for a brake job), and the truck smashes into your car,
<br>
totaling your car and severing your spinal chord at the neck, wouldn't you
<br>
want me to be responsible? Well, too bad. You can sue my corporation, but
<br>
it's broke. What a shame that you'll now be unable to pursue any gainful
<br>
employment and your savings together with your unemployment and medical
<br>
insurance don't provide enough to pay for the latest technology that would
<br>
have allowed you to rebuild your body. And there's no gov't assistance
<br>
available, so you linger on in a cheap nursing home, in constant pain from
<br>
oozing bed sores, reeking of urine until, mercifully, you die. Meanwhile,
<br>
I've started a new corporation to sell my self-improvement video that I call
<br>
&quot;It's Your Choice.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;confiscation of saved labor by the state is slavery.
</em><br>
<p>I take it you mean labor saved because of machinery, better methods of
<br>
production or service provision, etc. I don't see how this, either, is
<br>
relevant to whether or not corporations are desirable. Could you please
<br>
elaborate?
