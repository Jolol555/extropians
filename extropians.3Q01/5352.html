<em>&gt; But in the last chapter Kuhn tentatively attacked the view that science makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress toward objective truths: &quot;We may, to be more precise, have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relinquish the notion, explicit or implicit, that changes of paradigm carry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists and those who learn from them closer and closer to the truth.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kuhn's book lately seems to have become read (or at least quoted) as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manifesto for a general attack on the presumed objectivity of science.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Note Weinberg's correct observation that this is a tentative observation,
<br>
reinforced by Kuhn's &quot;we may&quot;. It's anything but a strident or definite
<br>
conclusion -- it's part of a section mulling over various ways to look at
<br>
the implications of the contrasts Kuhn noted between science's
<br>
self-description and its actual history. Is anyone suggesting that we should
<br>
never even consider the idea that scientific paradigm shifts form a
<br>
successive approximation to truth?
