</em><br>
<p>Integrity, autonomy, and vulnerability are definitely less fuzzy, to me,
<br>
than dignity here.  See my last paragraph.
<br>
<p>I don't necessarily think it's a major reason, but I think it can be a
<br>
motivating reason for some.  After all, the more fuzzy a term, the less
<br>
commitments one has to make, the less restrictions one has to put up with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It may be more of an European culture thing, where highly complex concepts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are fairly clear after 10 years of scholarly study are preferred in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the debate to strictly defined and narrow concepts. Also, the stuff we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to debate in ethics or the privacy discussion is very complex - it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might turn out that even the natural categories needed for this kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion are very complex and fuzzy.
</em><br>
<p>That's probably the major reason for usage.  Another is that these are
<br>
probably common points of a lot of different legal and ethical systems.  One
<br>
can talk about integrity in the context of JudeoChristianity as well as,
<br>
say, Objectivism or Kantianism.
<br>
<p>Not to be against scholarly study -- my mode of life anyhow:) -- but don't
<br>
you think that after X years of such, the fuzziness of the term will become
<br>
less?  The problem, too, is one of context.  A term or model used in a
<br>
scholarly context is often used with much mroe qualification than outside
<br>
it.  For instance, the notion of rights are much more clearly delineated --
<br>
even if there are disagreements -- among academics.  Most of them know the
<br>
difference between positive and negative rights.  (Of course, some argue for
<br>
both and some argue for one or the other, but they're aware of the
<br>
distinctions.)  The general public seems to lump all this together.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That said, it is clear that the fuzziness of these termes does lend itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to being stretched/squeezed to fit political aims. But this might be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of politicals exploiting lack of understanding of the concepts in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general public than a promotion of bendable concepts in academia. That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promotion likely have other causes.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, though this still brings up the matter of whether the &quot;bendable&quot;
<br>
concept is better.  If it's more likely to be abused, then, all other things
<br>
being equal, it might not be so good.  Maybe all other things aren't equal
<br>
and the payoff is higher, but this remains to be proved, don't you think?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Exactly. I might have a right to say whatever I want, but you don't have
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; listen to it and you definitely do not have to believe it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, privacy as it is generally used seems to deal more with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the more external aspects of ones self and life than integrity.
</em><br>
<p>I've always thought of integrity in two ways.  One is the more physical
<br>
usage of the term.  A container has integrity when it's not been breached.
<br>
The other is more ethical.  A person has integrity when he or she practices
<br>
what he or she preaches.  This second form obviously doesn't meld with the
<br>
first all that well.  They don't contradict.
<br>
<p>I tend to think a general right to privacy would include something like your
<br>
concept of integrity anyway.  After all, if we think of a private space, we
<br>
generally don't mean one that just others can't peek into, but also one
<br>
where the world does not impinge on.  You know, one's private home is
<br>
thought of as a place where one controls not only who can look in, but who
<br>
or what can disturb the interior or yard.
<br>
<p>I'm not willing to go to the barricades over which term we use, but I fear
<br>
some might sneak in other things by using integrity instead of privacy here.
<br>
This seems to be the case with dignity.  When people use that term it can
<br>
mean things like choosing who to marry or not to be harassed by the
<br>
government, but it can also mean things like the right to an education, job,
<br>
healthcare, unemployment insurance, housing, culture, a certain living
<br>
standard, and the like.  These can be smuggled into other concepts too.
<br>
<p>What might be smuggled into the idea of integrity here?
<br>
<p>Cheers!
