Aren't books by Heinlein and Asimov going to seem slow and dated to
<br>
a young reader today?  They were mostly written in the 40s and 50s.
<br>
Larry Niven's earlier books would be more accessible hard science fiction,
<br>
Ringworld and such.  Also the Niven and Pournelle novels, Mote in God's
<br>
Eye and Footfall.
<br>
<p>David Gerrold has had some success with his recent juveniles, Jumping Off
<br>
the Planet, and Bouncing Off the Moon.  I haven't read them but these are
<br>
&quot;in the tradition of the classic Heinlein juveniles&quot;.
<br>
<p>I'd suggest Harry Potter, but I'm sure he's already read them.
<br>
The latest Potter book won the Hugo this year, a change from the hard
<br>
sci-fi of Vinge which won last year.  But I liked the line on slashdot:
<br>
&quot;Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology.&quot;
<br>
<p>David Brin's Startide Rising is popular.  It's got a young character,
<br>
plus dolphins and interesting aliens.  Then there are a lot of sequels
<br>
if he likes it.
