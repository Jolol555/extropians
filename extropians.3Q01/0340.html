Excerpted from
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.mtsinai.org/pulmonary/books/scuba/sectionl.htm">http://www.mtsinai.org/pulmonary/books/scuba/sectionl.htm</a> :
<br>
<p><p>WHAT IS HELIOX?
<br>
Heliox is a mixture of helium and oxygen used for very deep diving, usually to greater than 200 feet. 
<br>
Helium's great advantage is that it does not lead to nitrogen narcosis. Helium diving requires as much 
<br>
or more decompression time as nitrogen, so there is no saving there. Beyond 300 feet heliox may cause 
<br>
the 'high pressure nervous syndrome', a shaking sensation that can be incapacitating. Another 
<br>
disadvantage of helium is that it conducts heat about six times faster than nitrogen, so divers get colder 
<br>
than with air diving. A third problem is caused by the fact that helium is much less dense than
<br>
nitrogen or air; as a result, the vocal cords vibrate much faster and divers sound like Donald Duck. 
<br>
Professional divers can use voice unscramblers to make their speech intelligible. 
<br>

<br>
WHAT IS TRIMIX?
<br>
Trimix is a mixture of oxygen, helium and nitrogen. Nitrogen, usually in a small percentage (e.g., 15%), 
<br>
is added back to heliox to create trimix, in order to lessen the risk of the high pressure nervous syndrome seen with
<br>
helium breathing. Nitrogen slows down nerve conduction.
