I must say that the the terror attacks agains the US are very tragic and I
<br>
was appalled. However, I don't see that this list should be a discussion
<br>
forum for it, since it's not the aim of this list to discuss such current
<br>
affairs.

<em>&gt; century&quot;. It may remind you of a remote peaceful hippy resistance and

sound
<br>

they

left.
<br>

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This analysis seems to proceed as if THE LUCIFER PRINCIPLE was never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;written; such largesse, reminding the recipients about who is currently
</em><br>
on
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;top in the pecking order, engenders jealousy, resentment and envy, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;gratitude.  It is likely that such a move could be counterproductive, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cause even more children (even if the same percentage indulged in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;practice but more survived) to be programmed, by their parents, mullahs
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;teachers, to become faith-based missiles of sui/homicidal martyrdom,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;directed against those who, by means of such largesse, had incindiarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;humiliated the programmers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if it seems counterproductive right now and even if more children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might develop the way you describe it, there should be a force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who shows mercy first. You cannot expect anything from a people that is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; badly suppressed like the Afghan poor. A couple of days ago I saw a BBC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; report by an Afghan born British journalist. She secretly filmed daily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live in Afghanistan in June 2001. It`s breaking your heart. Besides
</em><br>
children
<br>
<em>&gt; dying of starvation, men, women and children being slaughtered in villages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where bases of the Northern alliance fighters are suspected, it is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permanent suppression that makes you sick. No woman is allowed to work and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every girl at the age of 12 must definitely quit classes in school. Friday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afternoon a blood thirsty crowd gathers in a football stadium, built from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international funds, and watches thiefs being hanged on the goal posts and
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; woman accused of adultery being shot kneeling down at the penalty line of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the footbal field, men whose throats are cut, kneeling down there, too.
</em><br>
And
<br>
<em>&gt; the people are watching - it`s Friday afternoon - and yelling with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approval. And all these scenes were secretely filmed. This is real. What a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brutalization. They must see some signs that man can feel and act
</em><br>
different.
