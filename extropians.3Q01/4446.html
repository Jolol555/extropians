</em><br>
<p>Very true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note that where the individual is armed, confiscatory forces that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my state, we have the second highest per capita income, with the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and one of the highest economic growth rates. These are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coincidences.
</em><br>
<p>You appear to imply that the high gun ownership rate, low crime
<br>
rate, and low tax rates are sufficient for a prosperous society.
<br>
(Of those, only a low crime rate is actually *necessary*, although
<br>
Europe's high tax rates don't help any.)  I'm sure that you realize
<br>
a number of other factors are necessary.  No one has really pinned
<br>
down what they all are, but I'm afraid that it's inescapably true
<br>
that culture and the basic traditions of a society are very important.
<br>
Rather that what many misguided sociologists do---which is to attempt
<br>
to focus on the causes of poverty---they should direct their effort
<br>
instead towards explaining how prosperous and wealthy societies
<br>
come into being.
<br>
<p>Another way to look at it is this:  New Hampshire society may one
<br>
day devolve into a society that gets loses its ability to generate
<br>
wealth, even if everyone carried an Uzi, and government became even
<br>
more minimal.  What would suffice for this horrible transformation
<br>
would be that the citizens stop trusting one another to behave
<br>
non-violently, ethically, and industriously.  But these qualities
<br>
are deeply embedded in the culture and traditions of the people,
<br>
although it's always possible that they can be lost over time,
<br>
especially if damaging government policies that punish wealth
<br>
creation and reward sloth are enacted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problems of Brazil and Argentina are not of an armed populace,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but a failure of an attempt to privatize their economies.
</em><br>
<p>Yes; many of the citizens having to go about in armored vehicles
<br>
is a *symptom*, not a cause, of the problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Instead, they have become just two more petty mercantilist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economies, which treat social programs as merely bribes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep the masses at bay.  Only by arming the population as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole can a just resolution to these crises be developed.
</em><br>
<p>I would *not* be confident that this alone will be the entire
<br>
answer, though I think that you make a good point that it might
<br>
be a step in the right direction---odd as it does at first
<br>
appear.
