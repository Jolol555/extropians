<p>&lt;&lt; On the day, no-one from the BNP turned up (the home secretary banned them) 
<br>
but over 1000 asian youths (Pakistani and Indian) came out and had themselves 
<br>
a good old riot.  The police tried to break it up but were overwhealmed by 
<br>
the superior numbers of the rioters.  Only clever tactical skills by the 
<br>
commander of the cops allowed them to clear the streets but by that time the 
<br>
riots had raged for hours and had caused a great deal of damage. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>My guess is, or question is, whether the youth from India were Hindu or not, 
<br>
because my guess in no-and therein hangs your answer, in part, to why this 
<br>
riot happened?
