Would this be reasonable? I don't know, I'm just speculating here. Also,
<br>
I'm trying to gear the writing toward the general public (U.S.
<br>
specifically), so please keep that in mind. I welcome edits and/or
<br>
complete rewrites.
<br>
<p>No doubt there are 100's of thousands of computer programmers really
<br>
pissed off right now, rallying around the flag in a big way, perhaps
<br>
even for the first time in their lives. Many of whom have hacker skills,
<br>
and more importantly, many of whom have *international* contacts via
<br>
their work. Contacts in which race/religion/nationality are ignored in
<br>
favor of shared interests and expertise. Contacts that often use pen
<br>
names, and aren't necessarily compromised if appropriate information is
<br>
passed to authorities. Despite the probable desires of the intelligence
<br>
community to have sole responsibilities for anti terrorist intelligence
<br>
gathering in the U.S., this -- the geeks, nerds, and hackers making up
<br>
the computer community -- is a resource which should be nurtured.
<br>
<p>Yesterday, we lived in a different world. A world where legislation like
<br>
the DMCA, and subsequent events including the 2600/DeCSS case, the
<br>
cancellation due to threat of lawsuit of a presentation relating to
<br>
security defects in SDMI, the arrest of a Norwegian teenager linked to
<br>
DeCSS, the Skylarov arrest, and, most ominously, the proposed SSSCA
<br>
bill, was really causing a lot of anger among this community. Anger not
<br>
just against the MPAA and RIAA, but also the government. It may not be
<br>
very visible, since demonstrations against such things often consist of
<br>
only a couple dozen people, but the simmering resentment is there.
<br>
(Consider that many in this community are too busy to take time off to
<br>
demonstrate, and many are geeks and nerds who prefer the glow of
<br>
computer screens in a darkened room to daylight). This resentment is
<br>
leading to serious discussions of which free country to emigrate to.
<br>
(Russia is a recent candidate, being probably furthest from the reach of
<br>
the MPAA and RIAA, with the possible exception of China). If it
<br>
continues we may well see a major brain drain from the U.S.
<br>
<p>The discussion coming from some congressmen about re-examining civil
<br>
liberties, and computer community discussion about how this day will
<br>
lead to further repression of (for example) encryption technology (since
<br>
that could be used by terrorists), isn't helping. It's time to think
<br>
differently. It's time to get the hackers on our side. (They always
<br>
were, in most respects anyway, and especially so in this country, where
<br>
there is plenty of opportunity for talented people).
<br>
<p>The choice is really fairly simple. Do we want to make every electronic
<br>
networked device a tool of copyright law enforcement, as Hollywood and
<br>
the music industry desire and legislation like the DMCA and upcomming
<br>
SSSCA would enforce, and anger almost every hacker in the country? Or
<br>
can we ease up a little, restore some rights instead of eroding them
<br>
further, (recognizing that yes, a few Hollywood films or Brittany Spears
<br>
albums are gonna find their way onto the Internet) and turn this
<br>
community into an ally?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Mike
