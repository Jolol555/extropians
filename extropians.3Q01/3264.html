From: &quot;Lee Corbin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20New%20Ways%20of%20Thinking&In-Reply-To=&lt;129601c11ea9$4c5304e0$cf5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Can you explain more what you mean by direct experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the absense of thought?
</em><br>
<p>When the brain observes, listens, and feels without commenting...
<br>
By direct experience in the absence of thought I mean first hand, in person
<br>
experience. For example, the first time one bites into a tomato, the
<br>
experience is direct and may occur without any thought happening at the same
<br>
time. Driving a car 200 MPH, some drivers report that the experience displaces
<br>
the ordinary stream of thought. It is direct and unfiltered by thinking about
<br>
it. So direct experience in the absence of thought is nevertheless registered
<br>
in the brain, and sometimes registered more vividly than would be the case if
<br>
accompanied or diluted by thinking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It was forgotten long ago, and it can be remembered right now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What evidence do you have for this claim?  I.e., how do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that there was something &quot;long ago&quot; that existed, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is presently lost, but which can be &quot;remembered&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>If one remembers it, then that one will not ask for evidence, right? And if
<br>
one persists in forgetting, then evidence is not possible. The kind of memory
<br>
referred to here is the kind that one experiences when one &quot;remembers
<br>
oneself.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Who is it that seeks this control if not the old brain?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it is the old mind---that is, our present minds---which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seek this control.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps the word &quot;mind&quot; obscures the issue, because this word can be
<br>
interpreted in more than one way. So I say parts of the brain seek control,
<br>
and as the brain comes to recognize and acknowledge the unity of reality, it
<br>
understands that control is an illusion.
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, and ego.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
