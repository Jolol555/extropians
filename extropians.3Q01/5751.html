<p><em>&gt; What worries me, however, is that I've seen on this list an
</em><br>
extraordinarily
<br>
<em>&gt; high level of impatience with, and lack of imaginative identification
</em><br>
with,
<br>
<em>&gt; other people's current and historical sufferings. It's higher than I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encountered in any other forum.
</em><br>
<p>This message has continued to trouble me since I read it, and has caused me
<br>
to think deep and hard about &quot;other people's current and historical
<br>
sufferings.&quot;  The truth is I think about these things a lot and on bad days,
<br>
I despair.  But, even on bad days, I tend to bring an analytical approach to
<br>
the subject and, ultimately look for solutions.
<br>
<p>So my recent musings - prompted by Russell's comments - first sparked a
<br>
mental exercise in which I simply started making a list of all the
<br>
situations in the world today that are instances of human suffering that I
<br>
care about (some of which are included below).  This led me to try to
<br>
synthesize as clearly as possible what I think the causes of human suffering
<br>
are.  I've come up with a list of three root causes:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; disease
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; ignorance
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; injustice
<br>
<p>The more I've thought about it, the more it seems to me that all suffering
<br>
boils down to an instance of one or more of these three things.  As a
<br>
rational humanist, I take a broad view of &quot;ignorance,&quot; so that it includes
<br>
superstition.  As a transhumanist, I take a broad view of &quot;disease,&quot; so that
<br>
it includes aging. As a libertarian, I take a broad view of &quot;injustice,&quot; so
<br>
that it includes many more infringements of individual liberty that are
<br>
tolerated by the mainstream contemporary ideologies.
<br>
<p>If I apply these categories to the world I see around me, I see a LOT of
<br>
suffering.  Right now, we're all of us condemned to die from the aging
<br>
process, so we're all sick.  But of course, far short of that, a huge
<br>
portion of the human race stands exposed to death by disease, especially if
<br>
we include malnutrition in that category.
<br>
<p>Most of the world lives in thrall to some kind of irrational superstition,
<br>
so again, there's plenty of suffering out there.  Again, though, short of
<br>
this, large numbers of human beings are illiterate.  Even among those who
<br>
can read, knowledge of even the most basic outlines of the workings of the
<br>
natural world and of human culture and history is pretty thinly distributed.
<br>
<p>Based on my social and political values, the part of the world suffering
<br>
from basic injustice is far the largest.  This is such an overwhelming
<br>
problem that I do sometimes despair that any kind of rational and fair life
<br>
will ever be possible for most of humanity.
<br>
<p>So, selections from the catalogue of horrors:
<br>
<p>Geographic:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; Africa - so messed up in so many ways that just saying the word causes
<br>
heartache.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; Latin America - barely better than Africa.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; Southeast Asia - only slightly better than Latin America.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; The Middle East - I get more angry than sad, but the depth of hatred and
<br>
injustice there is a tragedy nonetheless.
<br>
<p>Political:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; The majority of the human race that lives without basic civil liberties.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; Shallow ideological caricatures that pass for &quot;policy&quot; in the &quot;advanced
<br>
democracies&quot;
<br>
<p>Social and cultural:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; Racism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; Sexism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; Superstition
<br>
<p>As I thought of my list of root causes of suffering, I could see them at
<br>
play in each of these &quot;sad spots&quot; in the world and each of the items on my
<br>
list of political and social ills that plague humanity.  Consider Africa:
<br>
Tens of millions will die from curable diseases, after living shortened
<br>
lives full of pain and loss.  Many of the problems could be solved by the
<br>
simple spread of knowledge - simple knowledge of better farming and hygiene
<br>
techniques, for instance.  Beyond this, the tribalism and ethnic hatred that
<br>
drive the current meltdown of the post-colonial civic order in Africa derive
<br>
from basic injustice; the injustice of judging people on the basis of
<br>
imagined group characteristics, the injustice of kleptocratic, militarized
<br>
state organizations and the injustice that naturally occurs in the absence
<br>
of the rule of law.
<br>
<p>I do believe that this suffering can be ameliorated, and I happen to think
<br>
that the technological advances we as transhumanists advocate will help to
<br>
do so greatly.  I also think that application of extropian values of
<br>
openness and toleration, based on the intrinsic value of the individual as
<br>
the prime locus of moral rights and duties is the ONLY solution to the
<br>
social and political aspects of these problems.
