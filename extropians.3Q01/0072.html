<em>&gt; &gt; I consider the issues at the basis of european extremism to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather simple, while their solutions are hilariously ludicrous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; American examples of extremism (slavery, civil rights, taxation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without representation, the desire to not live under the threat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of nuclear annihilation, the desire to not live in a police state)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are all rather profound issues of the human condition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those don't sound extreme to me; but perhaps that's your point. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, they are extreme measures to settle profound issues, rather than
<br>
extreme measures to settle minor issues with nutty solutions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You'd have to LIKE living like a lemming in a fishbowl in a house
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; full of hungry cats to enjoy the sort of extremism that occurs in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Europe.  I'm sure that such is just fine for some people, but we

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, your being born here may have had more to do with it :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, as all the do-gooders used to say about U.S. and Soviet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tendencies, &quot;they are becoming more like us, and we are becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more like them&quot;, a prospect I'm sure that you dread.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it was a matter of the family being forcibly transported way
<br>
back when...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amara adds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; So there is something going on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Europe is made of many many very different cultures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Your subject line reveals your bias, Lee.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can only infer from this that you believe that the fanaticism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exhibited historically by Germany, Italy, Russia, France (in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolution) and Yugoslavia (recently) have no common denominator.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suspect that they do; or rather, that there is an explanation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as to why America has been spared.  Further, I still think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Americans were fanatical about waging World War II (commendably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so, I should say), and are equally fanatical about anti-smoking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that possibly there is a common denominator (maybe Puritanism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Mitch and Tiberius suggested).
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'd add the British, in their hellbound rush to institute Orwell's
<br>
dystopia these days, to the list of nutty european countries. Moreover,
<br>
I'd say we were rather not fanatical about waging WWII: We resisted
<br>
entering the war for two years, we refused to carpet bomb blindly at
<br>
night as the British gleefully did, and unlike the Russians, we captured
<br>
far more German prisoners than we killed, rather than the reverse. Our
<br>
only 'extremism' was in dropping two nukes on Japan, which was more a
<br>
matter of a lack of desire to sustain 1-2 million casualties in trying
<br>
to take the Japanese home islands than any sort of actual extremism. An
<br>
extremist would have gladly sustained such casualties (as the Russians,
<br>
Japanese, and Germans all did in battle, and as the Jews did in their
<br>
extreme dedication to their wrong headed pacifism and personal
<br>
disarmament.)
