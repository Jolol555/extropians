<em>&gt; That's hard to refute because they don't listen, only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fight with nonproofs. It is based on irrationality for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most part. Talking snakes and magic apples?
</em><br>
<p>What a great line!
<br>
&quot;Talking snakes and magic apples?&quot;
<br>
That cracked me up. Thanks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mushrooms, maybe. Yet we are encouraged to believe in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Santa CLause and Easter Bunnies and Great Pumpkins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until we reach a &quot;certain age&quot; and then it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;debunked&quot; for us by adults. These same adults tell us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to believe in a god we can't see and in results we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't see. At least we could see Santa and the Easter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bunny, regardless that they were actors. No one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dresses up and masquerades as god that I know of, only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satan for halloween.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, who hasn't thought that Santa, the Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunnies, et al.,
<br>
were not training exercises for us to unlearn slightly more cosmic tales such
<br>
as Greek and Roman mythology, Bible, Koran, Gita, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Other parents have a handy answer--the Bible--and I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not. My road has been very tough, especially trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintain peace with other parents. My daughter's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boyfriend's parents always hate her because she is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;christian&quot;. I would feel sorry for her except that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know she is fortunate in many ways. She will join
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list or one like it someday and know she is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alone.
</em><br>
<p>I think she's lucky to have a Mom like you. Maybe she'll _own_ a list like
<br>
this someday.
<br>

<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
