<p>No personal offense intended, Eli, since I realize you fit this description
<br>
to a &quot;T&quot;.  And do note the rest of my post, in which I said that the folks
<br>
who are steeped in history haven't acquitted themselves significantly
<br>
better.
<br>
<p>But I would let the point stand: The fact is that meaningful knowlege of
<br>
history and culture is built up in a slow, painstaking manner over a long
<br>
period of time, and real wisdom takes even longer.  Please understand that
<br>
there should be no doubt about the deep reverence I hold for science and
<br>
engineering and the real respect and affection I have for the people who
<br>
pursue them.  I'm a &quot;science groupie&quot;.
<br>
<p>There are certainly scientific and mathematical tools that can enhace and
<br>
amplify an understanding of history, culture and society, from game theory
<br>
to evolutionary psychology.  But much of the core methodology of good
<br>
reasoning about these subjects is based on analogy and pattern-matching,
<br>
which can only be done successfully with a very large database.
<br>
<p>Finally, as for science fiction, well, I love it, too, but the fact is that
<br>
the vast majority of it contains the shallowest thinking about social
<br>
issues.  I recently weeded out the hundreds of SF books in my library when
<br>
we remodeled my study.  There was an unbelievable amount of garbage in there
<br>
