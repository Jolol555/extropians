<p><em>&gt; I believe that [Fred Reed's essay] violates many of the list

</em><br>
<em>&gt; was not aimed at specific list members has prevented me from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeking a ban on this topic and the posters who distributed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this garbage.
</em><br>
<p>Oh great.  Here we have an issue that taxes the emotional
<br>
control and objectivity even of extropians and... sure
<br>
enough, someone wants to ban it.  Do you not wonder then,
<br>
that people want to ban cloning and everything else that
<br>
makes them feel uncomfortable?
<br>
<p>The worst thing that I can say about the act of *posting*
<br>
such an  article is that it is in poor taste insofar as
<br>
many of the lurkers are concerned.  (I'll defend that thesis
<br>
some other time.)  But for extropians, it is obviously
<br>
exactly what is needed, and the 800 lurkers have to gear
<br>
up to the level of perspicacious analysis plain speaking
<br>
that often occurs here.
<br>
<p>If we cannot learn how to be objective and calm with 
<br>
ideas that disturb *us*, then how are we to approach
<br>
telling others about Jupiter brains, uploading, and
<br>
the singularity?
<br>
<p>Michael Butler writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given the number of reposts, I'd simply argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it has constituted something akin to IRC &quot;flooding&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Nonsense.  This is yet another symptom of the fact that
<br>
you are made very uncomfortable by the possibility that
<br>
while not literally correct, the essay delves into &quot;areas
<br>
that people were not meant to discuss&quot;.   One instance
<br>
of the reposting was done as a rather humorous comeback
<br>
to someone who had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh, by all means, let's RE-POST the entire article. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The other repost that I'm aware of occurred when someone commented
<br>
that he'd thrown his away already.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd make the same argument if it were a repeatedly posted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article about Central Europeans and their tendency to eat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flatulence-fostering foods.
</em><br>
<p>By no means would such a post make people so uncomfortable.
<br>
Now, what *would*  *I* complain about in like wise?  If a
<br>
post were exceedingly vulgar or moronic, I suppose. But
<br>
then, you probably consider the Fred Reed piece vulgar
<br>
and moronic, or do I miss my guess?   If so, you have to
<br>
explain how it is that a number of intelligent people do
<br>
not find it either vulgar or stupid.
