<em> &gt; Just out of curiosity, I'm wondering how many on this list feel
</em><br>
<em> &gt; they came up
</em><br>
<em> &gt; with the idea of the singularity on their own. I feel like I did, and was
</em><br>
<em> &gt; surprised to find an organization based, in large part, on the concept.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot; I believe H.G. Wells' Shape of Things to Come, Orwell's 1984, and similar
<br>
&nbsp;stories have predicted the basic concept of future-shock for a long time.
<br>
&nbsp;In the '70's there was a book called Future Shock.  People thought computers
<br>
&nbsp;would make life so complicated that we wouldn't be able to cope or
<br>
&nbsp;understand reality.  They predicted that the future would be so alien that
<br>
&nbsp;we would not be able to comprehend it or cope.  The entire world would be
<br>
&nbsp;transformed.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;I think historically, every generation has had this fear.  The industrial
<br>
&nbsp;revolution made people fear that machines would do all the work and humans
<br>
&nbsp;would either live in utopia or wander around dazed without any purpose of
<br>
&nbsp;function.  When the New World was discovered, it was an planetary reshaping
<br>
&nbsp;event that changed the view of the planet.  Entire geographies, cultures and
<br>
&nbsp;histories changed.  People suddenly could leave the known world and go
<br>
&nbsp;somewhere else.  This was seen as a bizarre change with a new world which
<br>
&nbsp;was assumed to be so alien that people wondered if it were possible to
<br>
&nbsp;colonize.  People feared the idea that the earth wasn't in the center of the
<br>
&nbsp;universe.  They thought that this concept plus other scientific discoveries
<br>
&nbsp;would rock the foundations of the cosmos so much that the common man would
<br>
&nbsp;be lost and unable to cope with reality.  Socrates was coerced into drinking
<br>
&nbsp;hemlock because his basic philosophical ideas and thoughts were feared to
<br>
&nbsp;corrupt a whole generation of youth with a culture so radically different
<br>
&nbsp;and changed that it threatened to bring down empires.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;I believe every generation believes that they are on the cutting edge of
<br>
&nbsp;some cataclysmic change.  They always imagine that they are possibly the
<br>
&nbsp;last generation and that the world would be destroyed soon.  The apocalypse
<br>
&nbsp;is always seen as immanent.  Each generations imagines that their
<br>
&nbsp;accomplishments piled on top of all historical accomplishments have
<br>
&nbsp;accelerated so far that there is no turning back.  They also have trouble
<br>
&nbsp;conceptualizing the changes such that they cannot fathom what future changes
<br>
&nbsp;will bring.  As such, they always predict total destruction or total
<br>
&nbsp;incomprehensibility of the future.  This is the basis of ancient religious
<br>
&nbsp;apocalyptic writings and mystical  revelations.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;There is nothing new in the concept that we will finally reach the ultimate
<br>
&nbsp;acceleration into infinity.  I think each generation looks like it is
<br>
&nbsp;advancing exponentially when compared to all previous generations.  What
<br>
&nbsp;looks like a steep exponential curve to us will be relatively flat to our
<br>
&nbsp;descendants.  I not only think that the concept of a singularity is an old
<br>
&nbsp;concept.  I think it is a recurring concept that will keep repeating.  We
<br>
&nbsp;will keep having continuous improvement into the future with no sudden
<br>
&nbsp;changes in reality.  We will adapt to sudden changes as we have adapted to
<br>
&nbsp;guns, steam engines, computers, space travel, internet, genetic engineering,
<br>
&nbsp;etc.  Cloning, uploading, and nanotechnology will merely be the latest
<br>
&nbsp;products on the market and will  soon become boring.  The riots and battles
<br>
&nbsp;over future technology will be just like past battles over slavery, race
<br>
&nbsp;riots, energy crisis, gay rights, nuclear energy, etc.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;In many ways, the more things change, the more they stay the same.&quot;

<p>Thanks, I appreciate your thoughtful reply. I agree with your idea that 
<br>
worldview-rending information, cataclysmic thought, and the idea that 
<br>
societal and technological change are accelerating have a long history with 
<br>
humanity. But, if I interpret you correctly, then I think I don't view these 
<br>
perennial phenomena as quite as similar to the singularity as you do. But 
<br>
maybe I misinterpet the extropian singularity and its similarity to my own 
<br>
idea. My idea is simply that, once an AI is created that is more intelligent 
<br>
than its creators (specifically, is more proficient in creating AI), then it 
<br>
will be capable of creating an AI superior to itself, and a cycle will be 
<br>
initiated whereby godlike intelligence and powers will be created. I'm not 
<br>
particularly concerned with the rate or predictability of the cycle, but just 
<br>
awestruck by the potential. I think this is a new idea to humanity, as 
<br>
opposed to something that most generations have been preocuppied with.
