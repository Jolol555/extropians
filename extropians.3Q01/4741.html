<p><em>&gt; I agree, I tried this and went from 250lbs (I know... shhh) down to 200lbs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in about 3 months! I was almost never hungry and got to eat all the great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foods I love. My breakfast a lot of times was a nice bacon and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheese omelet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a bacon side (I LOVE bacon). My wife made some no carb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chocolate mousse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for when I got those sugar cravings. I cant rant or rave enough about how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great this works! I'm shooting for 180 where Ill hold.
</em><br>
<p>Extropian diet club, anyone? :)
<br>
<p>I switched to a vegetarian, no sugar, no dairy, high fibre diet six months
<br>
ago or so. I dropped from a BMI of approaching 26 down to 22 in a couple of
<br>
months. I have to sleep a couple of hours less every day and no more
<br>
sugar-inspired mood swings either.
<br>
<p>Unprocessed honey seems to work for sugar cravings when it just gets too
<br>
much. Doesn't take a lot of honey, and it does seem to be processed sugar
<br>
that really kills me.
<br>
<p>Funnily enough, now that I'm on calorie restriction as well and (currently)
<br>
aiming (with mixed success, damn those houseguests) at 1600kcal/day, I'm
<br>
staying at a BMI of 22. My body seems to like being there. Odd and strange
<br>
but apparently eminently natural behavior.
<br>
<p>But then the focus on weight is a distraction, I think. It's a useful
<br>
calibrating tool for finding out what level of calorie intake one should be
<br>
aiming for, but only up to a point. After that, you just keep refining the
<br>
menu and cutting down on the intake until you start losing too much. Bracket
<br>
the target :) Not that I'd advise attempting anything of the sort without
<br>
reading the literature first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; P.S. Oh, I DONT exercise even though I should. I am hoping that I will get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of work and into the gym more soon. Still, 50lbs in 3 months without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exercise is amazing! I calculate my target weight in a few more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weeks. Wish me luck.
</em><br>
<p>I get out and dance twice a week. Everyone should do that. Or bike to the
<br>
office every day. The benefits are too good not to.
<br>
<p>Obligatory Longevity Meme stuff: I'd really like to put together some
<br>
articles on the effects of various diets from people who have tried them.
<br>
This is really basic, basic life extension stuff (right after &quot;quit smoking,
<br>
you fool&quot;), but visitors to the Meme need to see this stuff. At some point I
<br>
have to answer the &quot;why should I eat this way&quot; question for someone who is
<br>
going to respond most positively to a collection of testimonials.
<br>
<p>Volunteers feel free to email me off-list on that topic. The same goes for
<br>
anyone who knows of such articles already online -- I know that there's one
<br>
buried in the Life Extension Foundation website, but damned if I can find
<br>
it. Now there's a group that needs Google to sort their site out.
