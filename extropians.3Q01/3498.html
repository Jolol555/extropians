<em>&gt; I can't quite parse all these statements together into a viewpoint, but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do seem consistent and somehow all related together.  It almost sounds like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think reality is one way and then people think about it too much and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk themselves into a different viewpoint than reality would originally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicate.  Is this part of your viewpoint?  Is this where your list of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useless hypothesis derive from, all the distracting theories that complicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct observation of reality?
</em><br>
<p>The list of useless hypotheses derives from reading a number of articles
<br>
referenced by other list participants, including Max More, together with
<br>
logical extensions of those readings and conclusions from them. In addition,
<br>
messages posted by a few list members have provided necessary material for
<br>
including certain items in the list of useless hypotheses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know I am expending a lot of words to say I don't understand your post.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am not questioning or attacking your position.  It sounds interesting, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that I have not grasped it.  I probably have missed previous relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posts, and am trying to understand a discussion in the middle.  I am trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to catch up.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps the idea is too simple, and you are trying to read too much into it.
<br>
Essentially, my position is that people demonstrate reluctance to actually
<br>
look where evidence can be found. For example, the Pope reportedly refused to
<br>
look into Galileo's telescope, saying that whatever he saw in it would surely
<br>
be the result of evil influences. Similarly, folks with whom I exchange email
<br>
often refuse to try the simple experiment that I've mentioned, preferring to
<br>
ignore it or label it according to their preference, then dismiss it. As
<br>
someone once said, &quot;Don't bite my finger; look where I'm pointing.&quot;
<br>
What is the advantage of direct experience of reality, Lee Corbin has asked.
<br>
To me this question looks frustratingly contrarian, because it's like someone
<br>
in a prison cell asking what is the advantage of looking out a window. It's
<br>
even more frustrating as I need to use words to try to seduce your attention
<br>
away from words in order to try the simple (but nevertheless arduous)
<br>
experiment of going beyond words, to catch a glimpse of the universe ineffably
<br>
abiding beyond symbology, semantics, semiotics... words.
<br>
This is not a new way of thinking, it's the way humans can experience
<br>
existence beyond thinking, and it changes forever the way one looks at life.
<br>
It is good to look at a flower scientifically. A more complete view of reality
<br>
includes the remembrance that one is looking at a flower scientifically.
<br>
Vernor Vinge has noted two explanations of Fermi's paradox: civilizations
<br>
exterminate themselves, and post-singularity civilizations &quot;are so weird
<br>
there's no way to interact with them.&quot; A third possibility is that the human
<br>
brain has the capability to understand the significance of self-aware
<br>
intelligence, the non-teleological approach to the numinous, the effortless
<br>
insight that this is it, and it really doesn't get any better than this.
<br>
Evolutionary phase transition occurs when ten or fifteen people know this and
<br>
successfully transmit the information to every healthy human brain.
<br>

<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, and ego.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
