<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As most of you probably know, the House just voted overwhelmingly
<br>
to ban all cloning, even for research purposes.  This, and the resultant
<br>
slowing of scientific progress, was probably inevitable.  However,
<br>
President Bush is currently trying to decide whether to allow federal
<br>
funds for embryonic stem cell research.  The Jerry Falwell crowd is, of
<br>
course, rabidly against it.  Several prominent anti-abortion Republicans
<br>
have recently expressed support for it.  The Holy See, in his infinite
<br>
medieval wisdom, just had a personal meeting in which he urged our most
<br>
wise leader not to fund this research.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it could easily be 50 years until we can live in simulation,
<br>
we should all write Bush urging him to support the biotech research that
<br>
might allow us to survive to that point.  Our eternal lives may depend on
<br>
it!

<br>
at 202-456-1414, or mail a letter to:

<br>
<p>Letters probably have the most effect (assuming that he doesn't make his
<br>
decision before the letters arrive).
<br>
<p><p>Dear Mr. President,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge you to support the use of federal funds for embryonic stem
<br>
cell research.  Fertility clinics destroy many embryos that could
<br>
otherwise be used for stem cells.  Also, there are embryonic stem cell
<br>
cultures already growing; researchers could experiment with samples from
<br>
these instead of using fresh embryos.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embryonic stem cells are the most versatile type of cell- even
<br>
more versatile than adult stem cells.  They have the potential for
<br>
treating degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.  It might also be
<br>
possible to transfer the nuclei of adult cells into embryonic stem cells
<br>
and create young, healthy transplant organs with the same DNA as the
<br>
recipient.  This would NOT be cloning, but it would be an excellent
<br>
solution to the deadly problems of transplant waits and rejection of
<br>
organs by the immune system.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many wonderful life-saving treatments could come from embryonic
<br>
stem cell research, all without destroying a single additional embryo.  To
<br>
continue throttling this research would be short-sighted, irresponsible,
<br>
and ultimately fatal for many Americans.  The deadly effects of slowed
<br>
research might also spread to other biotech fields.  A hostile,
<br>
over-reaching government is very effective at stifling scientific
<br>
creativity and driving business to foreign countries.  If the research
<br>
community feels threatened by the government, the results will be
<br>
disastrous.  Even if one considers an embryo to be a human life, it
<br>
is still obvious that stem cell research will save lives overall.  Please
<br>
consider these practical arguments instead of allowing more lives to be
<br>
lost for the sake of ideology.
<br>
<p><p>Sincerely,
<br>
<p>Nathan Currier
