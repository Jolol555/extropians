A quick response . . .
<br>
<p>----- Original Message -----

From: &quot;Adrian `Guru Zeb` Harper&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:guruzeb@blueyonder.co.uk?Subject=Re:%20TERRORISM:%20looking%20for%20solutions&In-Reply-To=&lt;043e01c13be8$824d73d0$9865fea9@D6ZCKK01&gt;">guruzeb@blueyonder.co.uk</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;My father's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;generation went through the years of World War II with their basic civil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;liberties intact, although temporarily and modestly curtailed during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;actual conflict.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmmmmm i know a few US citizens of Japanese origin who would seriously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question this assumption.
</em><br>
<p>This was a deplorable thing -- an over-reaction if ever there was one, I
<br>
agree.  The US gvt has issued a formal apoplogy and paid financial
<br>
reparation, neither of which &quot;make it alright&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Contrary to the claims of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Arab-Americans and others today, and in the days that follow, that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;9/11/01 attacks don't represent &quot;true Islam&quot;, in fact they do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hmmmm really think you should have had a &quot;IMHO&quot; attached to this, since as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far as i am aware the Koran does not really endorse in it's many of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acts committed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in it's name.
</em><br>
<p>I began re-reading the Koran carefully today.  I post below (at the end of
<br>
this post) excerpts from as far as I've gotten so far that mark the book as
<br>
a recipe for hatred and fanaticism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;On the other hand, the modern dogma of cultural relativism makes any kind
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;public judgment of one culture by another impossible.  Any condemnation
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Islam for the fertilizer of fanaticism that it is would be interpreted by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the shapers of our own culture as chauvinism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are various historic reason for this, not least the fact that so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called &quot;inferior cultures&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have in the past been hugely exploited and oppressed. The aftermath
</em><br>
leaving
<br>
<em>&gt; the world with many of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the enormous and varied problems seen in Africa, South America, and many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other parts of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developing world.
</em><br>
<p>Not all of the cultural problems in these areas are due to be opressed by
<br>
Europeans and Americans.  Africans sold slaves to Arabs before they sold
<br>
them to Europeans.  China was a deeply misogynistic culture before its
<br>
modern contact with the West.  And don't get me started on the bloody
<br>
savagery of Pre-conquest Mesoamerican culture.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; [snip fascinating autobigraphical material which I much appreciated.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Now am pretty sure that the process of socialization experienced by many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Muslim kids from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor and deeply religious backgrounds is similar yet more extreme, to that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experienced by many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my friends. Young Muslim kids in some communities are raised to expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American abuse, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such the slightest mistake of presentation or policy causes a far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extreme reaction than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable. Christianity was for want of a better term &quot;tamed&quot; we need a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-confrontational strategy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do the same thing with Islam.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps this is the area that could be addressed and where serious useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes could be made.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This kind of approach would perhaps have a long time scale since it's main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; targets would essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the next generation of bombers. But maybe not after all, how many times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could a Muslim father
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave his home to cause mayhem with the disapproving looks of his children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to comfort him.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What ways can be found to essentially indoctrinate Muslim kids &quot; most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely at risk&quot; in broad minded,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberal tolerance. ( maybe even Extropian values )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course am not advocating overt indoctrination, this would be seen as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threatening, am advocating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something much more subtle than that. :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We probably all remember Gregs post about the young Indian boys future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading habits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the broad response it brought. It seemed almost everyone wanted to
</em><br>
help
<br>
<em>&gt; make the kids
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literary experiences rich and positive. Maybe we can put our heads
</em><br>
together
<br>
<em>&gt; and come up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with suggestions that could have a real impact. After all what could be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater Extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project than the creation of an Extropian generation.
</em><br>
<p>I am in broad agreement with you, but feel that the project is doomed before
<br>
it begins.  More about which as soon as I can find more time.  In the
<br>
meanwhile, here are quotes from about the first 20% of the Q'ran that I
<br>
found particularly chavinistic and inciteful to bigotry and violence:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
<br>
<p><p>&quot;2.190&quot;:    And fight in the way of Allah with those who fight with you, and
<br>
do not exceed the limits, surely Allah does not love those who exceed the
<br>
limits.
<br>
<p>&quot;2.191&quot;:    And kill them wherever you find them, and drive them out from
<br>
whence they drove you out, and persecution is severer than slaughter, and do
<br>
not fight with them at the Sacred Mosque until they fight with you in it,
<br>
but if they do fight you, then slay them; such is the recompense of the
<br>
unbelievers.
<br>
<p>&quot;2.192&quot;:    But if they desist, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
<br>
<p>&quot;2.193&quot;:    And fight with them until there is no persecution, and religion
<br>
should be only for Allah, but if they desist, then there should be no
<br>
hostility except against the oppressors.
<br>
<p>&quot;2.217&quot;:    They ask you concerning the sacred month about fighting in it.
<br>
Say: Fighting in it is a grave matter, and hindering (men) from Allah's way
<br>
and denying Him, and (hindering men from) the Sacred Mosque and turning its
<br>
people out of it, are still graver with Allah, and persecution is graver
<br>
than slaughter; and they will not cease fighting with you until they turn
<br>
you back from your religion, if they can; and whoever of you turns back from
<br>
his religion, then he dies while an unbeliever -- these it is whose works
<br>
shall go for nothing in this world and the hereafter, and they are the
<br>
inmates of the fire; therein they shall abide.
<br>
<p>&quot;3.12&quot;:    Say to those who disbelieve: You shall be vanquished, and driven
<br>
together to hell; and evil is the resting-place.
<br>
<p>&quot;3.28&quot;:    Let not the believers take the unbelievers for friends rather
<br>
than believers; and whoever does this, he shall have nothing of (the
<br>
guardianship of) Allah, but you should guard yourselves against them,
<br>
guarding carefully; and Allah makes you cautious of (retribution from)
<br>
Himself; and to Allah is the eventual coming.
<br>
<p><p><p>&quot;3.118&quot;:    O you who believe! do not take for intimate friends from among
<br>
others than your own people; they do not fall short of inflicting loss upon
<br>
you; they love what distresses you; vehement hatred has already appeared
<br>
from out of their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater still;
<br>
indeed, We have made the communications clear to you, if you will
<br>
understand.
<br>
<p>&quot;3.119&quot;:    Lo! you are they who will love them while they do not love you,
<br>
and you believe in the Book (in) the whole of it; and when they meet you
<br>
they say: We believe, and when they are alone, they bite the ends of their
<br>
fingers in rage against you. Say: Die in your rage; surely Allah knows what
<br>
is in the breasts.
<br>
<p>&quot;3.120&quot;:    If good befalls you, it grieves them, and if an evil afflicts
<br>
you, they rejoice at it; and if you are patient and guard yourselves, their
<br>
scheme will not injure you in any way; surely Allah comprehends what they
<br>
do.
<br>
<p>&quot;3.145&quot;:    And a soul will not die but with the permission of Allah the
<br>
term is fixed; and whoever desires the reward of this world, I shall give
<br>
him of it, and whoever desires the reward of the hereafter I shall give him
<br>
of it, and I will reward the grateful.
<br>
<p>&quot;3.146&quot;:    And how many a prophet has fought with whom were many worshipers
<br>
of the Lord; so they did not become weak-hearted on account of what befell
<br>
them in Allah's way, nor did they weaken, nor did they abase themselves; and
<br>
Allah loves the patient.
<br>
<p><p><p>&quot;3.157&quot;:    And if you are slain in the way of Allah or you die, certainly
<br>
forgiveness from Allah and mercy is better than what they amass.
<br>
<p>&quot;3.158&quot;:    And if indeed you die or you are slain, certainly to Allah shall
<br>
you be gathered together.
