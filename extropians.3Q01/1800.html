Jerry Mitchell writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;an economic system characterized by private or corporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by private decision rather than by state control, and by prices,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production, and the distribution of goods that are determined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainly by competition in a free market.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>That definition was supplied by Barbara, Jerry, not me :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nature imposes Capitalism, man imposes all other forms.
</em><br>
<p>Too many libertarians, in my opinion, forget the importance
<br>
of culture.  Actually, a hunter-gatherer communism is probably
<br>
more &quot;natural&quot; than capitalism.  But even very developed societies,
<br>
such as the Inca, might very well somehow make some form of 
<br>
communism work (lots of things are possible when your leader
<br>
really is God).
<br>
<p>We can probably safely state, however, that for human beings
<br>
capitalism is &quot;natural&quot; if
<br>
<p>1.  there is a sufficient tradition of liberty in a culture
<br>
2.  the ruling government or state is not overly powerful
<br>
3.  no existing religion has absolute control, unless it's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fairly mild and isn't antithetical to profit
<br>
<p>I think that I see why you wish to describe capitalism as
<br>
&quot;natural&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Capitalism is after all is what happens when one quits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to impose systems on man.
</em><br>
<p>While I can't agree with that for the aforesaid reasons, it's
<br>
true that in comparison, systems that arise from the concentration
<br>
of power at a central focus seem artificial in comparison.
<br>
