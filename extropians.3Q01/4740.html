I was just talking to one of my Asian friends about this and his thoughts
<br>
were that the Asian schools and American were exactly opposite in one
<br>
aspect. He told me that all the way up in grades through high school, kids
<br>
in his country busted their ass, stayed at school from 9AM to 9PM and
<br>
generally excelled. In college, the pace wasnt NEAR as rough. His view of us
<br>
was one where we coast up to the college level and thats where we start
<br>
kicking it in high gear. He even addmitted that the reason that most the
<br>
innovation and excellence from college level education in the US was because
<br>
he knew his buddies back in Korea were slacking and partying. Keep in mind,
<br>
this isnt my view, just my Korean friend. I have no clue of the accuracy as
<br>
I have no experience with foreign school systems.
