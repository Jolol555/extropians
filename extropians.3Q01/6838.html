<p><em>&gt;In reference to your comment:

<p>It's not necessary to wait for that, Mitch. You think we don't feel it too?
<br>
It's possible that more people per capita in Australia watched the
<br>
unfolding horror in real time than in the States, because it happened here
<br>
late at night and all our broadcast TV channels immediately went saturation
<br>
with feeds from CNN, ABC etc. You think we don't care? I do more business
<br>
with people, some of them old friends, in New York than in Melbourne or
<br>
Sydney. The world might not yet be a global village (I don't shed many
<br>
tears when a million people die in Bangladesh during a flood, and I doubt
<br>
you do either), but Australia is in effect an offshore island of the USA.
<br>
We watch your television, eat your junk food, dress in your clothing, read
<br>
your books... And the reaction in Melbourne as well as Sydney, to judge
<br>
from the vox pop of radio talkback programs, was every bit as furious and
<br>
unreflective as the worst I'd expect to hear from the USA. `Nuke the filthy
<br>
towelheads, bomb them back to the stone age, those dirty moslems, they
<br>
cause trouble everywhere they go...' So far, however, the worst that I
<br>
expected to hear from the USA has appeared in several posts on this list of
<br>
people avowedly devoted to reason and enhanced future--since in my view
<br>
it's worse, for example, to ponder genocide as a policy option than to
<br>
believe in the Face of Satan in the smoke of the burning towers, worse than
<br>
explaining the tragedy as God's wrath on the homosexuals and abortionists,
<br>
loathsome though those were.
