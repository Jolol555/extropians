----- Original Message -----
<br>
From: &quot;Samantha Atkins&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I agree with Anders that you seem to run together the concepts of Omega
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; point and singularity--and the concept of singularity is often used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ambigously. But nevertheless, perhaps you might say something about how
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conceive of 'eudaimonia'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Singularity doesn't require saying a lot about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfectability of individual humans (or posthumans).  However, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree that the abilities we will possess and many of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions along the road to Singularity require a great deal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious ethical thought and development.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as producing happiness, happiness is a somewhat slippery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept.  At the really &quot;happy&quot; end of what is possible I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picture all human beings being able to live long enough (with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backups, longevity treatments, uploads, whatever) and with such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an outstanding degree of freedom to get to choose how far they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will develop and in what directions and to decide what they wish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do, learn and be.  I cannot think of anything offhand that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would produce more potential for happiness than creating and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living such a possibility for oneself and all humans and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentients.
</em><br>
I agree (with the usual caveats of course). My question was to Waldemar
<br>
Ingdahl  whose original post suggested that there is some antagonism between
<br>
the notions of 'singularity' and 'eudamonia'. I was hoping that he might
<br>
explain this antagonism further. Just to be clear: most of your post was
<br>
directed to Waldemar Ingdahl. Unfortunately, when I quoted him I used
<br>
quotation marks rather than &gt; which makes this thread a bit confusing.  I
<br>
have responded here for all that I am responsible for.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; philosophical life is attainable only be a few humans and indeed is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unintelligible to the mass of humanity, &quot;the many&quot;. That the
</em><br>
philosophical
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; life will remain unknowable to the many certainly seems to have the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; epistemological slant as some understandings of the singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given time and technology enough it is understandable by all who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wish or will wish eventually to understand what of it can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understood.  Aristotle is limited by the perspective of inborn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capabilities and a fixed short lifespan.  There is no need for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these to be permanent limits even well before Singularity.  Thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no need to divide humans into those who get it and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who never will.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I agree with what you say: the malleabiity of human nature throws into
<br>
question much of our philosophical heritage, right from the Greeks to most
<br>
contemporary discussions. However, you miss my point. Waldemar Ingdahl
<br>
suggested that there is some antagonism between eudamonia and the
<br>
singularity. My response is that there is at least some connection, for at
<br>
least some of the Greek philosophers thought that philosophy was
<br>
incomprehensible to the many in just the same way that postsingularity
<br>
beings are often said to be incomprehensible to (at least) presingularity
<br>
human beings. The most vivid description of this is Plato's myth of the cave
<br>
(in the Republic) where he contrasts the wisdom of the philosopher king as
<br>
being analogous to a free person enjoying the sunlight; while the vast
<br>
majority of humanity are like slaves who live there whole life shackled to a
<br>
cave wall forever cut-off from seeing things as they truly are.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The unmoved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mover is not Christian, so so much for your &quot;companions in guilt&quot;
</em><br>
argument.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Indeed, one might think of the unmoved mover as the country cousin of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Omega point. Perhaps you could help by saying what you think the content
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;human flourishing&quot; is. As Aristotle points out, there are many theories
</em><br>
on
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this, when people are poor they say it consists in having wealth, when
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are sick it consists in health, and so on. How do you concieve of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relation between virtues and human flourishing? How should we invoke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Aristotle name if we give up what many commentators call his
</em><br>
metaphysical
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; biology?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why invoke anyone's name in particular?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Again just to be clear: it was Waldmar Ingdahl who raised Aristotle's name
<br>
not me. I also would like to see some clarification from Waldmar Ingdahl.
<br>
Mark.
