<br>
<p><em>&gt; Two assumptions that would be sufficient to recover the private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life of dead individuals would be:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; a) that it is possible to scan the complete brain/consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at some point in the future;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; b) that it is possible to time-travel under closure (without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spawning off some alternate universe).
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't all this just plain old &quot;history&quot;?  Every day historians
<br>
find out a bit more information about the past.  When we have powerful
<br>
enough computers - they will calculate and keep track of every
<br>
possible internal brain state that would fit within the constraints of
<br>
currently known data/history.  Sure there will initially be trillions
<br>
and trillions of diverse possibilities.  (Was there a single gunman
<br>
that killed Kennedy or was there more?  We still don't know for sure
<br>
so we must still keep track of both possibilities at the same time.)
<br>
But some day our ability to observe the ever increasing chaos and
<br>
entropy with greater detail, and with our increased ability to find
<br>
and keep track of historical data... there will be a continual stream
<br>
of data which will continually eliminate more and more of the
<br>
trillions of possible pasts that could explain the present we now know
<br>
about.  (Some day we'll likely discover a piece of evidence that will
<br>
either prove or disprove the lone gunman theory, eliminating all other
<br>
possibilities, right?)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people are attempting to extrapolate the future, they get
<br>
bitten by chaos theory right?  As in a single butterfly wing flap, or
<br>
not, could drastically change the weather on the other side of the
<br>
world.  But does this not work to our advantage when looking back to
<br>
the past, given large amounts of data tracking ability?  If the
<br>
weather is one way, then the butterfly must have flapped it's wings
<br>
right?  There is only one possible mental version of our great great
<br>
grandmother that could account for precisely our lives and environment
<br>
right?  If they had had any slightly different thought, at any moment
<br>
in their lives than the true past, we and our entire world would be
<br>
drastically different right?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate goal of historians is to eliminate all but one
<br>
possible past and thereby achieve a perfect history of everything
<br>
right?  So that we know the location and state of all particles at any
<br>
given time in the past.  If this is ever achieved, the historian's job
<br>
will be perfectly complete.  There will be no more history to do.  We
<br>
are certainly moving in the right direction and there is no reason
<br>
for us to think that we might some day hit a point beyond which it
<br>
will be eternally impossible for us to find out any more information
<br>
about the past.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sure, it'd be great if we discovered some cosmic quantum
<br>
recorder that could give us the location and state of any particle at
<br>
any arbitrary time in the past.  For then the historians work would be
<br>
completed that much sooner right?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achieving a perfect history/memory is no different than
<br>
&quot;time-travel under closure (without spawning off some alternate
<br>
universes&quot; right?  But for sure we'll also have fun trying and
<br>
simulating billions of - what would have happened had I done something
<br>
different - like had another child, or been able to go back in time
<br>
and talked to myself...  right?
