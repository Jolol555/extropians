<em>&gt; Part of the reason I've classified philosophy as useless has to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way pancritical rationalism makes it obsolete and irrelevant.
</em><br>
<p>This is not an answer to the logic of my argument.
<br>
<p>Also, my point is that pancritical rationalism relies on things outside
<br>
itself, despite the fact that some believe it a complete substitute for
<br>
epistemology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter that &quot;doctors&quot; of philosophy have made philosophy ineffectual (not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many suffer from that particular disease anyway).
</em><br>
<p>It depends on the philosophy and the philosopher, but this getting off
<br>
topic.  Pancritical rationalism is not only a philosophy, it's one built on
<br>
a contradiction.  It fails in the same way many other philosophies fail --
<br>
by assuming too much and undercutting what it assumes.  Rand called this the
<br>
fallacy of the stolen concept.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Essentially, PCR goes beyond the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; love of sophistry (aka, philosophy), to engage an attitude of discovery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on critical observation and the connection of reason to empirical everyday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life. IOW, it embraces the scientific method, which allows thinkers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supercede pure reason by opening their eyes to the infinite reality beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word games, to know existence directly, and to communicate that knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in terms that evolve as science evolves, which means learning from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience.
</em><br>
<p>I don't knock pancritical rationalists for admiring the scientific method,
<br>
but they cannot provide a justification for it.  They can't even, by their
<br>
own standards accept it, because to them there should be no reason to use
<br>
science over reading tea leaves or prayer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; <a href="http://www.extropy.org/pcr2.htm">http://www.extropy.org/pcr2.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;By replacing justificationism with fallibilism, and by encouraging the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practice of opening to, welcoming, and respecting criticism, pancritical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationalism maximizes the pursuit of truth, accelerating the death of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poorly-supported views and ineffective practices. It immunizes against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dogmatization, fostering critical thought and an anti-fideistic culture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opens every area of thought and practice to unlimited, perpetual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its critical procedures are precisely those embodied in science and, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope, in practicing scientists.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>But all of this finds it's base in a rational empiricism.  Just using pretty
<br>
words and phrases -- pretty for us, such as &quot;pursuit of truth,&quot; &quot;respecting
<br>
criticism,&quot; &quot;fostering critical thought&quot; -- doesn't make a position
<br>
defensible.  My argument is NOT that the methods of pancritical rationalism
<br>
are wrong, just that they are not enough.  They can't even underpin
<br>
themselves.
<br>
<p>I also argued in my piece -- did you read it? -- that &quot;One of these &quot;primary
<br>
criticisms,&quot; not &quot;contradict[ing] reproducible pieces of sensory data&quot; is
<br>
foundational! What's more, it is &quot;nonpropositionally justified&quot;! As I wrote
<br>
above, the pancritical rationalist sneaks her groundings in through the back
<br>
door - or, here, the front door when nobody is looking.&quot;  Using scientific
<br>
empiricism is foundational!  Pancritical rationalists claim to have a system
<br>
without foundations!  Yet pointing to experience to back beliefs is a form
<br>
of foundationalism.  It is experience as foundations and there's a huge
<br>
tradition in philosophy of relying on the evidence of the senses -- e.g.,
<br>
see David Kelley's _The Evidence of the Senses_.  (My review of the last is
<br>
at <a href="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Percept.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Percept.html</a>)
<br>
<p>Anyhow, thanks for commenting on my &quot;Comments on Pancritical Rationalism.&quot;
<br>
Finally, after two years, someone has.
<br>
<p>Later!
