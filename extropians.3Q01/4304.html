<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; I agree with Robin that it sounds like the last gasps 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; of those who don't want to admit that once we know 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; how to fly, the blood of billions will be on our 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; hands for not doing it sooner. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;[Note, I don't think this is an accurate paraphrase of Robin's posting.] 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;One thing that does come through in the on-line articles is the damage 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to the Drexlerian nanotech vision done by its association with cryonics. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;We had some discussion last year about a similar article in Nature that 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;made the same connection (might have been by one of the same guys). 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Where cryonicists see nanotech as lending credibility to their field, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the rest of the world sees nanotech's credibility as being destroyed by 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the connection to cryonics. Most people seem to have an strong prejudice 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;that cryonics cannot (or should not?) work, and any technology that 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;could supposedly make it work becomes instantly suspect. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Much of the criticism of nanotech in the sciam articles brings in its 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;supposed utility for cryonics, as though that is a sort of reductio ad 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;absurdum that proves the vision is false. Super computers, ultra strong 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;materials, even self replication may be acceptable dreams. But raising 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the dead is beyond the pale. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I tend to agree with Robert above that ultimately this is due to the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;understanding that if cryonics works, if currently dead people are some 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;day brought back to life, then we are all responsible for a holocaust 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;beyond imagining. Every person allowed to die today without suspension 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;is an unnecessary and preventable death. As Robert says, the blood of 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;billions is on our hands. Most people are not able to deal emotionally 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;with the horror of this possibility. 
<DIV></DIV>
<P>&gt; </P>
<P>I have to disagree with you on the reason why people are uncomfortable around cryonics.&nbsp; In conversations with strangers at the bus stop, I often manage to work in the fact that I am signed up for cryonics. I like to do this when there are several people involved in the conversation.&nbsp; They are disbelieving at first, and then the discomfort sets in. But I don't think they have time to think about the possibility that by not doing cryonics, their loved ones are dead. It seems to be a visceral feeling that the idea is essentially &quot;wrong.&quot; I think it has something to do with universal societal taboos dealing with the dead. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;(Of course, even most of us signed up for cryonics aren't doing anything 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;about it either, and we are the ones who are most likely to have to face 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;consequences eventually for our inaction.)
