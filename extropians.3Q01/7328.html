<p>No doubt, but how telegenic are they? Wouldn't they be seen by the
<br>
american television-watching audience as just more nondescript
<br>
un-uniformed towel-heads running around with AK47s? Would sincere media
<br>
interviews with these people provide insights into the nature of god,
<br>
religion and how society be structured that would be in-line with
<br>
western ideals? I think not.
<br>
<p>Maybe providing clean uniforms, a shave and a haircut would help here.
<br>
Ooops, maybe not :-/
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think strikes on the Taliban's remaining military assets: it's Sukhoi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fighters, Tu-54 and 55 tanks, etc would also help tip the tactical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balance. 
</em><br>
<p>Tactical balance aside, showing downing of enemy fighters -- especially
<br>
if accomplished by america's islamic allies, as televised during the
<br>
gulf war -- would be a big ratings hit. Tu-54's and 55's are getting a
<br>
little old and don't look anywhere near as formidable as our own M-1
<br>
tanks, thus perhaps not the most photogenic of targets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I thought of something like this, but more along the lines of a bounty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Taliban: $100 US for each rifle and Taliban head brought in.
</em><br>
<p>It would be interesting to know the average cost per dead enemy soldier
<br>
for the various wars of the 20th century. I think $100 may be a
<br>
pittance, perhaps $1000/taliban head is doable. I dunno how well
<br>
bounty-induced killings would fare on the evening news, however,
<br>
especially if it looks iffy that this dead guy in a turban with a long
<br>
beard is actually an enemy combatant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Producing fake bodies is not needed, the real thing is all to prevalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already in that country.
</em><br>
<p>Sad but true. As this continues the corpses will pile up in great
<br>
numbers.
