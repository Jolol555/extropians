</em><br>
<p>I think the main reason is that a lot of people know less aboiut
<br>
economics than California governors. 
<br>
<p>Imagine that you believe economics is not a science or field or research
<br>
but just a rationalization for the rich to get richer. Imagine that you
<br>
do not know how to interpret or get statistics to check your opinions
<br>
and frankly don't care. Imagine that you have this self-consistent
<br>
belief system that tells you things are in general run by small selfish
<br>
elites oppressing you and everybody else, that the market is the tool
<br>
for these elites and that trade and globalization, being apparently what
<br>
these selfish elites like, makes you worse off. If you held this belief
<br>
system you would of course see evidence for it in all news - if people
<br>
buy coffee at Starbucks, then they have been suckered by advertisment
<br>
manipulations, if the Argentinian economy is not doing well then it must
<br>
be the will of the Powers That Be showing how cruel they are, and so on.
<br>
<p>Then add in a number of groups with strong self-interest: farmers that
<br>
do not wish to see any outside competition or decrease in agricultural
<br>
support, unions that do not wish to encounter restructuring of their own
<br>
industries and foreign competition, xenophobes that do not like the idea
<br>
of open borders and intellectuals (of whatever stated party color) that
<br>
have again found a forum where they can be taken seriously. These groups
<br>
will of course argue for the above belief system - sometimes knowing the
<br>
flaws of the model, more often even making themselves believe it. They
<br>
also employ whatever channels will produce results, both lobbying
<br>
politicians and supporting friendly demagogues. 
<br>
<p>There is no need to assume secret cabals of ex-stasi or KGB agents
<br>
behind the scenes. It is more a matter of a lot of well-meaning people
<br>
who have a faulty model of how world economy works being partially
<br>
influenced by some self-serving groups with compelling arguments. 
<br>
<p>If you add in a couple of &quot;professional&quot; rioters and anarchists (whose
<br>
allegiance seems to be to experiencing the heady mixture of community,
<br>
danger and fighting, with the above belief system sometimes just thrown
<br>
in as a justification) you will have a recipe for riot. But even without
<br>
the violence the above memeset is destructive; in many ways the
<br>
peaceful majority of the anti-globalisation movement is more dangerous.
<br>
<p>Remember Greg's Extro talk - if you look at the protesters and the
<br>
organisations represented, you will see a strong predominance of the
<br>
guardians, romantics and mystics.
