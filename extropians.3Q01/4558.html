<em>&gt; In reality, of course, all these proposals---including yours
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too, unfortunately---cannot, in the old phrase, &quot;turn a sow's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ear into a silk purse&quot;.  Two things will always be missing---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pace Singularity---namely:  (1) the native talent, intelligence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and temperament that distinguish thoughtful, productive, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent people the world over from the criminal, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid, and the insane, and, (2) the traditions, cultural mores,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and memes that prosperous and technologically advanced segments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of societies all around the world always exhibit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eugenics (or genetic engineering) could accomplish (1), but for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2), only time and the incremental processes of economic advance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fostered by freedom and liberty will help.
</em><br>

<p>It would be extremely surprising to find that Eugenics could accomplish what
<br>
you claim. More sarcasm, perhaps?
