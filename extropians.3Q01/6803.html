This whole scenario involving ground troops imho could become extremely 
<br>
protracted and costly
<br>
for the US.
<br>
============================
<br>
A ground war in Afghanistan would be extremely protracted and costly for
<br>
the US, unequivocably, and Powell and Rumsfeld both know this.  The most
<br>
effective way to eliminate Bin Laden would be reinforcement and 
<br>
reorganization of the CIA to go back into the business of assasination
<br>
and militant-hunting in the Middle East.  The theory is that this would
<br>
cause fewer civilian casualties - but, of course, it has its own set of
<br>
potential problems, including lack of support from allies and repercussions
<br>
for the very freedoms that allegedly we'd be fighting for.  The US is in
<br>
a bit of a quandry - everyone wants Bin Laden and his associates to be
<br>
flushed-out and arrested, but nobody knows HOW they want this done in 
<br>
order to minimize civilian casualties and maintain the principles of
<br>
international law, justice, and the humane aspects of Western civilization.
<br>
I can't imagine that the people who did this didn't take this quandry into
<br>
account to use to their advantage... wish THEY were so humanistic in their
<br>
thinking about the whole situation... 
<br>
<p>Holy Wars are hard to win.  Never mind the realpolitik background reasons
<br>
for the support, bad US foreign policies, etc... now that people believe
<br>
in a Holy War, it's going to be pretty difficult to just turn it off, and
<br>
Western Democracy is doubly encumbered if we want to advance our program
<br>
of moving away from barbarism and towards a humane regieme of law, justice,
<br>
compassion, freedom, and, someday, peace... 
<br>
<p>I hope someone figures out a good solution (I'm trying to, but even if I
<br>
did, who'd listen?), because so far ALL the options look pretty bad...
