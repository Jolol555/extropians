<em>&gt; &gt; I frankly oppose living near individuals who think its fine to outsource

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm puzzled by this. I'm not sure what's bad with delegation, certainly not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independence, as you still need to rely on your local weapon dealer. True,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government monopolies tend to produce inefficient or bad service, and surely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the police force is probably no exception. But in a free market, you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to delegate wisely.
</em><br>
<p>The problem, of course, is with concentrations of force and dependencies
<br>
on large concentrations feeding a tendency toward monopolization of the
<br>
market of force.
<br>
<p>Governments come about specifically because of this blind spot.
<br>
Individuals too squeamish to do their own dirty work empower
<br>
amalgamations of force through security subcontracting that can
<br>
overwhelm other individuals who are not so inclined.
<br>
<p>In a purely economic transaction, there is no force involved in the
<br>
transaction, so both parties can walk away without fear of recrimination
<br>
impacting their ability to continue existence. In force transactions,
<br>
those without means equal to the opposing party will always lose if the
<br>
opponent calculates a positive benefit to using force to violate the
<br>
free market. As soon as a person hires a large group to exert force for
<br>
them, all parties the person deals with are no longer operating in a
<br>
free market, nor is the person operating in a free market with respect
<br>
to the large group they have hired. If the large group mandates that its
<br>
clients be unarmed, then they are totally at the mercy of the large
<br>
group.
<br>
<p>Vinge dealt with some of these issues in his story &quot;The Ungoverned&quot;, but
<br>
I don't think that he represented them properly or accurately, but a
<br>
better treatment, IMHO, is H. Beam Piper's novella &quot;Lone Star Planet&quot;
<br>
(also serialized as &quot;A Planet for Texans&quot;), and to a lesser degree, its
<br>
accompanying novella, &quot;Four Day Planet&quot;.
<br>
<p>Because the libertarian system revolves around self ownership, and self
<br>
responsibility, the defense of the self, by the self, is of greater
<br>
importance than any other imperative in society. Without it, a
<br>
libertarian society will generally evolve toward greater concentrations
<br>
of power in force monopolies, as has occured here in the US.
