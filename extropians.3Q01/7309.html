<em>&gt; &gt; I am more concerned by claims that since we are in a state of war, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is permissible to suspend various guarantees of our rights and freedoms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If we are not actually &quot;in a state of war&quot; then these claims are bogus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and should be opposed as false.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If so this seems to be a big gaping hole in Constitutional checks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and balances.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the &quot;clear and present danger&quot; clause.  The government has to follow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the constitution unless there is a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; that requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more desperate action.  The government has always had the ability to bypass,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignore or suspend any constitutional restrictions whenever it deems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary.  Luckily, we have three separate branches of government.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less likely that those who make the rules, those who enforce the rules, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who judge the rules will all abuse their authority at the same time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the same agenda.
</em><br>
<p>Except that those who enforce the rules are trying to rush through changes 
<br>
to the rules whithout those who make the rules having their normal due 
<br>
process and these changes would bypass largely those who judge the rules.  
<br>
I refer to the MATA proposals fromt he Attorney General's office.  Of course 
<br>
his office and the FBI assure us they will protect our rights.  Which is nice 
<br>
to know since, if this goes through, we will have little  protection other 
<br>
than their assurances in areas that can easily be broadened.  
<br>
<p>Parts of what is  proposed include being able to forget about due process, 
<br>
search and seizure, judicial review and so on for foreign nationals engaged 
<br>
in or even thought to be engaged in terrorism or anything anyone later 
<br>
labels as terrorism (like cyber &quot;terrorism&quot; if you break copyright perhaps?) 
<br>
and all who aid and abett them.  The latter probably could be stretched to 
<br>
where being a member of a group actively protesting such things or standing 
<br>
up for the rights of the accussed and those detained without any sort of 
<br>
due process could itself be seen as support of terrorism and subject you 
<br>
to such measures yourself.  
<br>
<p>This stuff is deadly dangerous.  I would sooner take my changes with being a 
<br>
victim of the terrorists than have that kind of sword hanging over my head.  
<br>
But it is all for our own &quot;protection&quot;.
