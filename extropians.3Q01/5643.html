<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; From: Spike Jones:  No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;self respecting executive would work for 140k (or 400k).  spike

<em>&gt; Tiberius Gracchus wrote: The people who run for president (and get the Dem/GOP
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nominations) are *driven* to acheive. These people have inculcated in them by their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents a drive to perform public service and/or achieve greatly.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money...not a real concern. I offer Gore &amp; Bush as PERFECT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples....
</em><br>
<p>Does the current occupant of the White House fit this theory?  {8^D
<br>
History may well remember him as the accidental president.
<br>
<p>I have had personal contact with two presidents of Lockhee.dMartin,
<br>
either of which would surely have faaaar outperformed either of the
<br>
candidates for US president in 2000.  I have had personal
<br>
contact with three flag rank military officers, any one of which
<br>
would have been a faaar better choice for that office.  Lets face
<br>
it Americans, last time around we had a choice between two
<br>
losers.  Of course the presidency would have been a major
<br>
pay cut for the LM officers, but a raise for the general/admirals.
<br>
<p>Your point is noted, Tiberius, that salary isnt a major consideration
<br>
for those running for the top offices.  spike
