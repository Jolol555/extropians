<em>&gt; &gt; SDI is the only moral option for a libertarian society based on the

</em><br>
<p>Theres an intercept test this evening.  Ive been away on a camping
<br>
trip in the Sierras, so I havent heard if it is still on.  Everybody
<br>
pick a side {targets or interceptors} and cheer for your team.
<br>
<p>GO GET EM, INTERCEPTORS!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At this point it is still mostly a massive costly boondoggle in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the making.
</em><br>
<p>The SJ Mercury News would certainly agree with you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The research done by Dave Redell of CPSR on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (in)feasibility of building software that would achieve the necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims of the SDI project are still the best reference on this subject...
</em><br>
<p>...that you know of.  {8-]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not being able to shoot a single missle out of the air in a fair trial is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one problem,
</em><br>
<p>Solved.  The Block 2 THAAD missile is 2 for 2 now.  The only 2
<br>
firings of that version has hit both times.  Of course the Merc didnt
<br>
tell you that, and they *continue* to insist that no intercepts have
<br>
been successful.
<br>
<p>You did say &quot;fair.&quot;  If the intercept is successful, the Merc can
<br>
always report that the test was rigged.  If unsuccessful, its an
<br>
unworkable boondoggle.  Tomorrow's newpaper will tell.  If it
<br>
is on the front page, we missed.  If we hit, it will be buried on
<br>
p.17, a half a paragraph reporting a rigged test.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but they also have to get their software to work correctly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every time in the first battle, without any reasonable arena for evolving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it into robustness beforehand.
</em><br>
<p>Have we not done exactly this with the fleet ballistic missile?
<br>
We randomly choose one out of the fleet and fire it, usually 2 or
<br>
3 times a year.  The last 91 consecutive firings have been
<br>
successful.  Why is not the FBM analogous to the SDI?  Could
<br>
we not test the software repeatedly?  Could we not have
<br>
redundancy by firing several interceptors at an incoming
<br>
missile?
<br>
<p>Lets see how this evenings test goes.  Im cheering for the interceptors.
