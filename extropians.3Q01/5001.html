Lee said
<br>
&nbsp;I believe that there really are such
<br>
<em>&gt;things as bigotry, authoritarianism, harmful condescension,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;collectivism, racism, inconsistency, lack of compassion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arrogance, and unfairness, and that they should be exposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and demonized.  &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I can't agree that we should agree to say that morality
<br>
<em>&gt;exists---that's really going too far.  It clearly all comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;down to what people approve of and what they don't approve of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If we attempt to get precisely factual, we simply cannot appeal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to &quot;moral laws&quot;, or &quot;rights&quot; (except legal ones), or any of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that stuff unless it's clearly shorthand for &quot;I approve&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;I disapprove&quot;.  The purpose of showing someone that he or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;she is arrogant, or lacks compassion, or is a fascist is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make him or her feel bad.  By **their** own semantic links
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and real connection to the world and to other individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the world, and their own conscious (and unconscious) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unavoidable judgments of others, if one can show a sufficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt;real similarity, his or her own conscience will be activated.
</em><br>
<p><p>I go along with this to a very considerable extent (I don't know that I'd
<br>
think of &quot;inconsistency&quot; as being in the same class as the others on the
<br>
list, and I don't think collectivism is *always* a bad thing, just very
<br>
often a bad thing). However, I'd be wary of the word &quot;relativist&quot; and its
<br>
cognates.
<br>
<p>I'd rather save that term, in the meta-ethical context, for someone who
<br>
takes the following kind of &quot;cultural relativist&quot; position, supposed to be
<br>
an argument for inter-cultural tolerance: what is &quot;morally right&quot; means what
<br>
is considered so by the particular culture concerned; this reflects what is
<br>
functionally valuable for that culture; it is &quot;therefore&quot; wrong for one
<br>
culture to impose its moral values on another.
<br>
<p>As Bernard Williams pointed out many years ago, these propositions are
<br>
internally inconsistent, since it may be functionally valuable to culture A
<br>
(and hence &quot;morally right&quot; within that culture) for it to develop
<br>
institutions for imposing its will, including its views of moral right and
<br>
wrong, on culture B.  These institutions may include armadas and armies,
<br>
colonising expeditions, aggressively proselytising religions, etc.
<br>
<p>This might be called &quot;the New Age theory of morality&quot;. A variation of it is
<br>
to relativise with respect to individuals rather than (or as well as) with
<br>
respect to cultures, so that whatever is valuable for me is morally right
<br>
for me and &quot;therefore&quot; no one should impose his/her moral values on me.
<br>
<p>It is not a theory I hold, in either form.
<br>
<p>However, Lee is using terms such as &quot;ethical relativist&quot; more broadly, where
<br>
I would use the term &quot;ethical subjectivist&quot; and its cognates, and I don't
<br>
think there's a lot that's different in our approaches. At least, I think
<br>
our approaches to investigating and discussing moral issues could largely be
<br>
translated into each other.
