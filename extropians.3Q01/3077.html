<em>&gt; &gt; A while ago I reponded to Barbara Lamar's comment of

<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you're non-white, when, to the best of my knowledge, whites

<em>&gt; &gt; commit at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as many crimes per 100 people as do non-whites. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   I insted found a summary of that document here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If recent incarceration rates remain unchanged, an estimated 1 of every 20
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; persons (5.1%) will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; serve time in a prison during their lifetime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;                 Lifetime chances of a person going to prison are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; higher for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;

<em>&gt; &gt;                     -- men (9%) than for women (1.1%)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;                     -- blacks (16.2%) and Hispanics (9.4%) than for whites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Al, I stated that whites and non-whites commit about the same number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crimes per 100 people but that non-whites have a much higher chance of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrested and convicted of crimes. Please be aware that the statistics you've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quoted are based on people who've been arrested and formally accused of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crimes. Even if they're true, they don't refute what I wrote. I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally observed that whites commit at least as many crimes as non-whites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per 100 people (naturally, this is estimated--I haven't kept formal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; records). It's true that whites are more likely to commit white collar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crimes than non-whites, because white-collar work is what they DO more of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your average white person's going to be more skilled at embezzling money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from her employer and writing hot checks than at armed robbery.
</em><br>
<p>I have to take significant exception to this, Barbara. Crime studies
<br>
don't only look at arrest and conviction data. Some deal with surveys of
<br>
victims for a more victim-centric view of crime as it is committed, not
<br>
as it is enforced. For example, the FBI claims that there are only
<br>
around 90,000 defensive gun uses per year, yet surveys show that the
<br>
actual number is somewhere around 2.5 million per year. (Google up the
<br>
work of Gary Kleck) Similarly, victim reports of the race of
<br>
perpetrators (and the race of their victims) shows that blacks commit
<br>
90% of the crime perpetrated against other blacks, but a majority of the
<br>
crime perpetrated against whites.
<br>
<p>Of course, this could likely leave out victimless crimes, but other
<br>
studies of white collar crime, and its prevalence, should shed some
<br>
light on this. I would buy the fact that whites likely commit more white
<br>
collar crime than blacks, that being their more likely environment, but
<br>
what are the actual numbers?
