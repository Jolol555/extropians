<p>Thank you Samantha for some lucid thinking on this thread.  I agree with
<br>
almost all posts except those whose aim is to chastise religion,
<br>
spirituality or the church.  (How many is that? -:))
<br>
<p>I didn't understand why the word &quot;war&quot; was used by L.B., but I have read
<br>
past of _The Art of War_, so I backed off, giving some leeway.  
<br>
<p>When Tiberius Gracchus wrote on a parallel thread  &quot;...the churches are
<br>
typically packed with the elderly and sick superstitious, trying to get to
<br>
the next world....&quot; I realized it was his/her personal view, however it
<br>
makes me wonder why.  People who go to church, people who value ideas other
<br>
than extropian ideas, people who have a desire or need for spirituality are
<br>
not backward and unintelligent.  Many are creative and highly intelligent
<br>
and who simply see things a different way because of deeply ingrained
<br>
belief systems, early imprinting, fear of the unknown, social conditioning,
<br>
professional affiliation, or simply like the music, atmosphere and wine.
<br>
<p>Unless and until those who petition their particular religions views to
<br>
impede the direction, progress and accomplishments of extropian
<br>
transhumanist views, the only war is within the domain of rigidity. 
<br>
