</em><br>
<p>Regardless of whether your theory is correct or not, the result will be the
<br>
same.  This tragedy is being used by the administration to justify their own
<br>
policies.  Bush believes we need a capital gains tax, we need more tax cuts,
<br>
we need to borrow from social security, we need to make wiretaps easier to
<br>
get, we need to reduce the need for search warrants, etc.  He is pushing the
<br>
same agenda as before, but this time as a response to terrorism.  I also
<br>
have seen Republicans insisting that we were not heading for a recession
<br>
before this attack, and that Bush had turned to economy around.  They say
<br>
that the terrorists have put us into a recession.
<br>
<p>I also note that nobody has changed their agenda on either side of the
<br>
aisle.  The pro-gun people think this is obvious proof that we need to allow
<br>
guns on planes, while the anti-gun people think this is obvious proof that
<br>
we need to restrict even more weapons.  The pro-Bush people say this is
<br>
obvious proof that we need to pull away from Israel as Bush is doing, while
<br>
the anti-Bush people say this is obvious proof that Bush's strategy isn't
<br>
working.  The globalists say this is obvious proof that we need to become
<br>
more involved with world affairs, while the isolationists say this is
<br>
obvious proof that we need to get out of world affairs.  The pro-religious
<br>
see this as proof that we need to become more religious, while the
<br>
anti-religious see this as proof that we need to stamp out religion.
<br>
<p>Nobody is going to stand up and say that this event has changed their minds.
<br>
Everybody is even more determined that their viewpoints are right.
<br>
Everybody assumes that this proves their point as everyone else should see.
