About E. Shaun Russell's &quot;Reality Is Leaking Again&quot; mp3,
<br>
&nbsp;Hi-ya!
<br>
&lt;posh scenester mode&gt;
<br>
I have a comment about drum n' bass in general: it is, like, so '95, isn'it?
<br>
:-)
<br>
&lt;/posh scenester mode&gt;
<br>
More seriously, you are talented: this track made me think of photec
<br>
quality, what I liked best about it is the tabla-tamtam thing that sounded
<br>
like it was straight out of a roman gay disco song from '82! This to me it
<br>
is le dernier mot de chic, and it will soon be present in the work of a
<br>
couple of haute-pop designers,  bravo.
<br>
<p>In my opinion, Intelligent Dance Music (IDM) seems the closest aural
<br>
equivalent of extropy-transhumanist thinking for it reflects the cutting
<br>
edge of technological progress and boundless creativity.  If you know about
<br>
this cultural object E. Shaun Russell,  please excuse the redundance and
<br>
allow me to share my enthusiasm to the rest of the community.
<br>
<p>On IDM: the quantity and quality of these releases is incredible!  Can't
<br>
really dance to it, but it keeps one interested regarding to its complex
<br>
cognitive plays, innovativity, sophisticatedness, otherness aesthetic. This
<br>
scene of new electronic sounds searchers enjoy the work of extropic-at-heart
<br>
people like Autechre who are writing wares that compose their ground
<br>
breaking creative music.  BTW, IDM and hemisphere sync is the perfect
<br>
background sound to do some serious reaserch :-D
<br>
<p>This is my personnal &quot;short best of the best the 01 summer&quot;, get yourself
<br>
morpheus at cnet
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://download.cnet.com/downloads/0-1896420-100-5590701.html">http://download.cnet.com/downloads/0-1896420-100-5590701.html</a>  Playfully
<br>
expand your mind
<br>
<p>www.mouseonmars.com/  actual new sounds of quality! They are the super-group
<br>
on earth right now.
<br>
&nbsp;(my fave songs: presence, subsequence, doit)
<br>
www.peachfuzz.net/lexaunculpt/  Angular and different.
<br>
&nbsp;(enjoy their site,the design is very inspiring. Songs: Tell Me you love me,
<br>
Metroid, My Peach and My Pear )
<br>
www.marumari.com/  lusher, fancier, he have these impossible nostalgic
<br>
anthems about loving life in a future yet to come.
<br>
(fave songs: baby m, indigo florist, rocket summer)
<br>
<p>p.s. I suggest to listen first... and then buy if you like, usually the CD
<br>
artwork is as intelligent
<br>
<p>Amicably, Chikara
