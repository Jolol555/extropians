<em>&gt; &gt; How old am I?  Old enough to vote.  Anything else is on a need-to-know

<em>&gt; I really don't see this; really, really not. It just doesn't sound plausible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be so absolute about this; it begins to seem like an issue of faith in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; error is-this-working timescales...
</em><br>
<p>I also tend to be very nervous about making possibly mistaken
<br>
predictions.  But the above reflects my current belief that the idea of
<br>
the Singularity taking until 2030 is simply too far out for me to assign
<br>
it any real probability.  If something unexpected leaves us out in the
<br>
cold, it'll mean a Singularity delayed until 2020.  Not 2030.  There's
<br>
simply too many hammer-blows due to hit our world in the next ten years,
<br>
never mind the next twenty.  They may kill us.  They may save us.  But
<br>
it'll be all over, one way or the other, before 2030.
<br>
<p>It's not a question of &quot;I predict all these totally different new
<br>
technologies will be created sometime in the next fifty years, based on an
<br>
extrapolation of exponential trends.&quot;  Predictions like that sometimes do
<br>
go wrong.  But when I put my ear to the ground, right now, what I hear is
<br>
a world that is already trembling.  My feel for these technologies says
<br>
that almost all of the race has already been run.  The human condition is
<br>
drawing to a close.
<br>
<p>If I turn out to be wrong, if there's much more distance left to be
<br>
covered or if those last few yards are covered very slowly, then that
<br>
would mean delaying until 2020, instead of everything being settled over
<br>
the next decade.  That's a real possibility.  But to suppose that things
<br>
will not have been settled by 2030 is such a low probability that I don't
<br>
feel any worry at all over using the phrase &quot;cast-iron guarantee&quot;.  I find
<br>
myself completely lacking in any emotional anxiety that I will look like
<br>
an idiot in thirty years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyone want to roll out some numerical- and factual- based arguments on one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side or the other?
</em><br>
<p>What good would those do?  If there's enough slack in the numbers and
<br>
structure that you can &quot;prove&quot; anything you like by picking your
<br>
arguments, then mathematical projection is the wrong way to make
<br>
predictions for that question.
