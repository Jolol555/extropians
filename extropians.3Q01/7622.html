<p>Oh I dunno. I've been reading stuff like:
<br>
<p>The Clash of Civilizations, by Samuel P. Huntington
<br>
<a href="http://www.alamut.com/subj/economics/misc/clash.html">http://www.alamut.com/subj/economics/misc/clash.html</a>
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>The Roots of Muslim Rage
<br>
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/90sep/rage.htm">http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/90sep/rage.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Which, as you can tell by the titles, postulate deep deep differences
<br>
that are not gonna go away anytime soon. It's almost enough to make one
<br>
long for the communist era and a return to the cold war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that a strategy worth trying is memetic warfare in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conjunction with economic aid. Give them some secular nonsense to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occupy their brains so there's less room for religious nonsense. Give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them something to lose and they won't be so in love with carnage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Call it moderation if you want. I've thought of a catchier name--
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         The Porkrinds, Porn, and Pilsner Campaign
</em><br>
<p>I agree that memetic warfare can be very much a useful potential
<br>
strategy, but I would hope extropians can come up with something better
<br>
than dropping pork rinds on muslims. While some starving Afghanis,
<br>
perhaps especially women begging in the streets to secure food for their
<br>
children, might appreciate crunchy pork snacks, the price of getting
<br>
caught doing so might well be immediate execution.
<br>
<p>Here are some possible strategies:
<br>
<p>1) Convert to Islam. Why not? I've been arguing anyway that a
<br>
people-centered security state is quite possibly better than a
<br>
technology-centered security state, and at least Allah never came out
<br>
against many specific extropian and futurist goals like nanotechnology
<br>
or space travel (as far as I know). I'd much rather live in a state
<br>
where many things are forbidden than one in which everything is
<br>
forbidden but that which is specifically allowed, which I see as the
<br>
endpoint of the technological security state (my new term for what has
<br>
previously been called ubiquitous law enforcement). In any case
<br>
education has historically been a good thing in Islam. Perhaps we can
<br>
get Bill Gates to explain that nothing works right till version 3.0 with
<br>
Old Testament = v. 1, New = v. 2, Koran = v. 3. At least american office
<br>
workers can appreciate that logic.  Once we get off-planet we can start
<br>
reasonably discussing atheist societies.
<br>
<p>2) Move all Israelis to New York, make NY state the new Israel, then
<br>
nuke Jerusalem. At least this puts the center of controversy within a
<br>
relatively much safer christian civilization and should defuse the whole
<br>
middle eastern issue. Nuking Jerusalem is just an end-point to prevent
<br>
future war over it. Nobody would want it if it was highly radioactive.
<br>
The Israelis could take the Wailing Wall with them and reassemble it in
<br>
some empty space in Manhatten. Hmmm.....
<br>
<p>3) Think a generation ahead. Offer muslim women free immigration to the
<br>
US, along with young kids, but no males older than maybe 10. And of
<br>
course they leave their husbands behind. Perhaps they might convert to
<br>
christianity if free to do so. Of course announcing such a policy might
<br>
lead to millions dead in a bloodbath but imho we're heading there anyway
<br>
might as well do it now and get it over with. In any case the only part
<br>
of Dubya's most impressive speech announcing war on terrorism that is
<br>
actually maybe working at all is the turn-them-against-each-other
<br>
strategy, except of course that it applies to all islam not just the
<br>
terrorists. I mean, didn't he give a clear-cut ultimatum to the Taliban
<br>
to a cheering congress? Good thing he didn't specify a time frame,
<br>
though the 'tone' of the ultimatum I at least interpreted as 'a.s.a.p'
<br>
if not 'immediately'. Not 'if and when you find time to get around to
<br>
it'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Where reason and basic human decency fail, perhaps the adversary's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic human greed and hedonism can still offer a ray of hope.
</em><br>
<p>I think you may be projecting western values here.
