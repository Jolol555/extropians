<em>&gt; P.S. Standing challenge to any of you liberals out there ....  Confess how

you have articulated to yourself something as explosive as &quot;Fred Reed's
<br>
piece is racist&quot; but with the shoe on the other foot, and how you, even
<br>
though it was exceedingly painful, had to give huge aid and comfort to your
<br>
ideological opponents.
<br>
<p>I not only fought, I switched.  The &quot;huge aid and comfort to my ideological
<br>
opponents&quot; in my case was already given, when, as a young adult (having
<br>
grown up in a Republican, White Russian monarchist, religious family) I
<br>
evolved into an nontheist and liberal.   There was purpose and reason behind
<br>
that decision, and liberalism is where I feel at home, and where I hear my
<br>
&quot;sweet voice of reason.&quot;
<br>
<p>But, as the old Bob Dylan song goes, I'm a liberal, but to a degree.  I am
<br>
not
<br>
an advocate of bi-lingual education, for instance, although teaching
<br>
languages in school (which is a different animal altogether), and the
<br>
earlier the better, is commendable IMO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (P.P.S.  I don't think any of them will.)
</em><br>
<p>Lee, Lee, Lee ... and you accuse other people of being arrogant, sometimes,
<br>
tsk,
<br>
tsk.  Don't put all liberals into the same box.  We all lead complicated
<br>
adult lives, and I have hardly ever met anyone who is &quot;100% this&quot; or &quot;100%
<br>
that.&quot;  I have liberal friends with whom I disagree (about environmental
<br>
issues - I think ecoterrorists are criminals; about the rights of animals -
<br>
I eat 'em; about certain feminist issues - I believe in gender equality,
<br>
period; and, furthermore, I'm not a post-modernist).  I don't read something
<br>
or hear about something and then figure out if I'm for it or against it
<br>
after consulting the crystal ball of my ideological inclinations.  There are
<br>
often gray areas.  There are inconsistencies, sometimes.  But I'd rather be
<br>
inconsistent, at times, than inhuman at any time.  When in doubt, do the
<br>
loving thing, if  possible.
