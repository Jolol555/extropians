<em>&gt; &gt; I see no really good reason for a continuing large force in

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relative to our ability to quickly move in forces when necessary

<em>&gt; &gt; region.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That may be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But what seems clear to me (and makes the previous point not very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important in the frame of this discussion) is that some of what you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will keep provoking the rage of some islamists, even if you don't want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, and don't understand why. For them to be &quot;ruled&quot; by you, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever conceivable sense and indirect way, is just totally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unacceptable ; justice is that it be the other way around. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infidels should be ruled by the faithfull, not the other way around.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I have no interest in ruling in any of these countries, even
<br>
indirectly.  There is no &quot;justice&quot; when people of any kind are
<br>
forced
<br>
to live by rules of other people they do not agree with.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; See for example Lewis' &quot;The Roots of Muslim Rage&quot;, already mentionned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/90sep/rage.htm">http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/90sep/rage.htm</a>

<em>&gt; &gt; I don't see why it is the business of the US to practice world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; domination nor do I see us really doing that.  If it is our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; business then we should do it honestly imho and establish a true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one-world government and mono-culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not speaking of an actual domination, something that is concretely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present everywhere all the time, but a potential domination, that is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; checking at any given point in time that you can regain control, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if at a cost.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It depends on what you mean by &quot;control&quot; then.  If you mean
<br>
keeping some regime from doing much what was done by Germany at
<br>
the start of WWII then I can see some point in that level of
<br>
&quot;control&quot;.  If you mean keeping that extra 25% of our energy
<br>
budget being supplied by MidEast oil then I think it would be
<br>
far more logical to find other ways of supplying our energy
<br>
needs. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't dismiss it easily but I don't believe the fault is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Islam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Read sourate 9 (sorry I didn't find the English for sourate, that's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;chapter&quot;) of the Coran and tell me about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is hardly relevant.  You can find sections of the Bible
<br>
that are pretty bloodthirsty.  This hardly means that Judaism or
<br>
Christianity are inherently bloodthirsty religions.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I know of course that many muslims don't follow this blindly. But if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you take it as it is (not by some strange fanatic reading ; just as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is), then you should fight against and kill all non-muslim, whithout
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even thinking of your own life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Would you call anyone who would take some scriptural exhortation
<br>
to kill all unbelievers literally as being a sane follower of
<br>
Islam?  No?  Then why belabor it?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  If you want terrorists and mad crusades look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Christianity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about 500 years ago and some of the continuing extremism to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; day. Yet there is no real support for such methods in the New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Testament.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this is not a good argument. Atheists made slaughters, too, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that. It doesn't entail that some religious content cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes provoke violent action. Sometimes the cause is not there ;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes it may be. In this instance, the terrorists actions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistant with sourate 9. And if you listen to one of these people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (violent islamists), you discover that they are not vile nor mad, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loyal and consistant with their beliefs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>They are both vile and mad by their actions.  Their opinions are 
<br>
irrelevant to the judgement.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is not a yes/no problem. Imagine that your friend is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; badly hurt, and asks help from you to counter. Depending on the kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of help she asks, what really happened, what might happen next, who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the attacker, etc., you will have a tension between various desires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and fears. It's a matter of nuance and quantity, and to make the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; choice you need to limitate the amount of blindness and cowardness that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; you put in the resolution of the problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Where did cowardice entere into this?  How does any blindness at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all help?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was talking about France. What I meant is that refusing support to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US is a decision in which cowardice (sorry for awkward English and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thanks for your patience) and blindness can play a role, not only the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitimate auto-determination and own vision of things. Cowardice, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoid fighting of course, but more to avoid possible later retaliation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from terrorists ; blindness, to consider that this is a USA problem,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we are not concerned by it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>When you throw in &quot;cowardice&quot; you make the entire discussion
<br>
more emotional and further from the point I was attempting to
<br>
get across.  That point is that nearly automatic support of the
<br>
&quot;war against terrorism&quot;, no matter what its form, is every bit
<br>
as much the enemy of freedom and security as terrorism itself
<br>
is.  Of the two I would
<br>
feel less in danger from terrorism than from the lack of
<br>
freedom, squandering of resources, unlimited government and
<br>
persecution likely to be made part of this &quot;war&quot;. 
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; But I don't want to insist on this last point : first it is &quot;our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business&quot; ; second, I agree with what you said initially : that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposing the alternative &quot;you support us blindly or you support the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists&quot; would not be nice.
</em><br>
<p><p>OK.
