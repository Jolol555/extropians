<p><em>&gt; Why does society consider a person who can memorize words and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulas, or discern problems presented in a written test be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to &quot;think&quot; than someone whose cognizance is highly skilled
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;in dealing with life's varied problems and applying knowledge to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;clear-headed analysis?  I don't.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I think most people would agree with you, Natasha, that common sense is as
</em><br>
important as IQ. The two kinds of intelligence aren't mutually exclusive,
<br>
though. I haven't followed the discussion about Mensa on Cryonet, but the
<br>
people I met at the Mensa dinner meetings seemed quite ordinary; some seemed
<br>
to be well endowed with common sense and others didn't, as with any other
<br>
gathering of people.&lt;
<br>
<p>I think this is true of everyone.  If we dig deeper into each person, regardless of IQ, we will find something of interest.  I'm not into  criticizing &quot;mensa&quot; social skills. I am very interested in understanding why *any* highly thinking-skilled person is able to understand the formula for being healthy but not practice it.  I wonder at my own ability to understand complex ideas, but not able to augment them into my life. It may be laziness or preoccupation with something else.  But with a group such as mensa, for example, if members take pride in being highly skilled thinkers but don't internalize the information or apply the info, were's the log jam?
