<em>&gt;Helen writes
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Perhaps I should mention that I'm writing a masters paper on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attitudes to the modification of the body - grounded in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sociology of the body - hence why I'm trying to understand the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;various strains of thought regarding the body by those on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;list. There is a definite obsession with the body in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particular discipline - something that I'm hoping to challenge in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this paper - it seem to be based on modern to postmodern
</em><br>
<em>&gt;values of subjectivity versus objectivity, knowledge versus
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expression...and the like.It stems from Satre and even a Romantic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;notion that the body and self are a whole, and that happiness can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be found by disciplining and shaping the body to an ideal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perfection - here the media comes in and does its stuff!
</em><br>
<p>This notion is much older than this, I get it from the ancient
<br>
Greeks and their notion of &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; later picked up by the
<br>
Romans and Leonardo De Vinci, and perhaps epitomized by
<br>
Michelangelo's David.
<br>
<p>This is rooted in the idea that a sound mind in a sound body is
<br>
perhaps the most useful of combinations, and in fact support each
<br>
other.
<br>
<p>Sound wisdom in my book.
<br>
<p>The Olympics being the current tip of this metaphorical iceberg
<br>
with professional sports in a close tie.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Now the problem that I'm getting though is that extropians want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;modify and enhance themselves through science and technology -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their goal is immortality or at least longivity.  Now this goal is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;based on being able to create/design a better body, one that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does not have the fraility and limitations of the present
</em><br>
<em>&gt;biological one  so aren't you just as obsessed with the body as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those people who go down the gym everyday and bust a gut also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trying to create the ideal body? So you're question below about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strange ideas about the body doesn't make sense to me.
</em><br>
<p>As a matter of fact I am in the gym 6 days a week pursuing the
<br>
ideas indicated above, but I also study 7 days a week as part of
<br>
the same program.
<br>
<p>Enhancement falls right into this line, I'm convinced the ancient
<br>
Greeks/Romans would have engaged in it had they had the technology.
<br>
<p>Extropians spend a great deal of time talking and thinking about
<br>
thinks other than themselves, since we want to live in a better
<br>
world or worlds, so I don't think obsessive fits.
<br>
<p>Is it obsessive to want to better yourself?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Of course it could all come down to self confidence and if one has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a strong sense of identity - if you're particularly subject to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;others remarks and opinions of you, then of course you will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;affected more than someone who has a definite sense of who they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are...and more importantly who they want to be.
</em><br>
<p>I think we have a definite sense of who we are and who/what we want
<br>
to be, but rather than just sitting around talking about it, we're
<br>
actively out trying to do something about it.
