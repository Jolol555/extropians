This is a post I sent originally to Cryonet.  It involves Trygve Bauge who 
<br>
has been overflowing the list there with his frequent emails about his 
<br>
fledging cryonics storage company in Norway.  I kind of feel for the guy and 
<br>
so wrote this.
<br>
<p>John :)
<br>
<p>My 4th of July plans fell through and so I spent part of the day in a 
<br>
college computer lab getting updated with cryonet.  Damn, I wanted to eat 
<br>
BBQ today!  I laughed so hard at some of the posts I read regarding poor 
<br>
Trygve that I caused people to wonder what the heck was so funny!

On the other hand, perhaps the cure IS worse than the

(end)
<br>
<p>Hmmm... yes, it could be very scary.
<br>
1. Overly friendly Raellians who want to clone Trygve and Louis Epstein!
<br>
2. Friends of the man who wrote _Battlefield Earth_
<br>
3. Me(when I finally get my own computer!) Writing even a few posts does 
<br>
tucker me out though...

<p>Doug Skrecky's &quot;diet for stress&quot; is a masterpiece!  It can't be worse then 
<br>
the &quot;eat only oranges&quot; diet an elementary schoolteacher of mine went on 
<br>
years ago.  I do think Trygve needs a diet which will not provide him with 
<br>
even more empty calories to burn typing at his computer in a vain attempt to 
<br>
respond to every query which comes his way! :)

Imagine the possibilities... If you visit the forum, you'll see what I
<br>
mean. You can create virtually unlimited numbers of new threads! And
<br>
it's a much more powerful way to communicate your valuable ideas because
<br>
you can EVEN get a search engine installed.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>Trygve, you have a real friend in this man. He has created for you a place 
<br>
on the net to post to your heart's desire!  I am touched that Rick would 
<br>
take the time to set all this up for you.  The problem of course is that 
<br>
with cryonet you have a much wider captive audience... ;)
<br>
<p>I think on Cryonet you still have many friends.  You just need to take into 
<br>
account what they are trying to share with you.  My dad's side of the family 
<br>
came largely from Norway so maybe that will help me a bit! lol
<br>
<p>To be honest, I find Swedes to be generally very friendly but Norwegians to 
<br>
be cold fish tempermentally(not to say you are!).  Of course, this is my own 
<br>
unscientific opinion.  We do get alot of tourists in Alaska!  I tend to be 
<br>
reserved and even very shy in the real world so it made me wonder if being 
<br>
part Norwegian were part of it.
<br>
<p>I had a friend who spent two years in Norway.  He said the women were very 
<br>
beautiful and not too attached to their clothes while on the beaches.  I 
<br>
think this made concentrating on his missionary duties somewhat difficult 
<br>
while near the coastline... lol
<br>
<p>You need to pay more attention to your girlfriend!  Is she someone you would 
<br>
want to spend the next several centuries with?  Focus less time on the 
<br>
cryonet and more time on your fledging organization and HER!
<br>
<p>Create an elitest email message list where only key people are allowed to 
<br>
know of your cryonics plans.  Make people feel special for having been 
<br>
allowed on it.  Believe me, Alcor and CI have alot of online business done 
<br>
which we never hear of on Cryonet.

As far as your nightly sleep is concerned, now that I know it is a problem: 
<br>
Couldn't you just set the digest to automatically go out twice a day e.g. 
<br>
every 12 hours rather than just every night? If that is impossible, then 
<br>
what about changing the clock forward 12 hours or so in the morning  so that 
<br>
the digest goes out automatically around noon, then set it right again in 
<br>
the afternoon, so that the digest goes out automatically again at night?
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>HAHAHAHA!!  This is too damn funny!  Yes, some of us must schedule our lives 
<br>
around your frequent posts!
<br>
<p>Trygve wrote:
<br>
Maybe there is a letter circle managing software that automatically creates 
<br>
such a content list and digest. If not, maybe some of the computer 
<br>
programmers reading cryonet would be interested in creating such a 
<br>
software,it could come in handy for other letter circles that experience 
<br>
high traffic as well. A programmer could probably make some bucks on 
<br>
developing such a software.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>Aha, so instead of mending your ways you want to change the format we 
<br>
presently have!  Well, there is already plenty of software out there to do 
<br>
what you suggest.  To be honest, I like the current format and don't want to 
<br>
change it for you.  I peruse cryonet by routinely scanning the archives.

Conclusion is:
<br>
Individual websites are fine,
<br>
and each person their own forum is o.k.
<br>
Put still there should be a place for large forums
<br>
that are dedicated to specific topics, and seen by many people,and where 
<br>
anyone can post anything that is on topic.
<br>
The challenge is just to make it easier for such forums to handle large 
<br>
traffic, and make it easier for people to navigate within such forums.
<br>
e.g. make it easier for the subscribers to such forums
<br>
to navigate within a lot of traffic.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I understand how you want to get the word out on what your are doing, in 
<br>
part due to the need for guidance and encouragement from more experienced 
<br>
people.  Perhaps sending out private emails to target specific individuals 
<br>
would be better to gain the counsel you need as you build your organization.

While abhorring censorship, I add my voice to that of Mike Darwin and others 
<br>
kindly but firmly requesting that these astonishingly verbose gentlemen 
<br>
consider shorter and more pointed postings.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, it has been interesting following Trygve's exploits with 
<br>
a cryonics startup...and his sincerity and willingness to work seem clear 
<br>
enough, although his stability is certainly open to question.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I agree with Rudi's sympathetic sentiments here.   You do not want to 
<br>
alienate the very people whose help you need.  I actually feel sorry for you 
<br>
because I sense your desire to be accepted, helped and encouraged.  And we 
<br>
all need that.
<br>
<p>It's just with your past history(town outlaws cryonics due to you) and less 
<br>
then ideal character recommendations(from Mike Darwin and Charles Platt) 
<br>
which make things hard for yourself.

<br>
It is not organizing cryonics improvements or dealing with the government 
<br>
that takes so much time,
<br>
but having to  rebut all the attacks from other cryonicists.
<br>
<p>I have over the years never seen such attacks on cryonics or my cryonics 
<br>
involvement by the regular media as I have experienced from a few other 
<br>
cryonicists. Are the latter paid to sabotage the movement or what?  ):
<br>
What about tolerance, and letting others do it their way?
<br>
As long as there is full openness, then anyone that sees something they 
<br>
don't like, can of course point this out, but what about doing so in a 
<br>
cultivated manner???
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>Trygve, you have obviously not gone way back in the cryonet archives to read 
<br>
the flame wars of olden days!  Contention, division and cryonics sadly seem 
<br>
to often go together.  Maybe there is something darwinian going on here 
<br>
which is good for us in the long run...  Medieval and renaissance europeans 
<br>
constantly squabbled and look what they eventually accomplished!
<br>
<p>I agree that tolerance is very important and that criticism should be done 
<br>
in a cultivated manner where possible.   I really empathize for you and 
<br>
think people have been in some ways harsh to your feelings and good 
<br>
intentions.  I feel like you are a well-meaning dog which has tried to be 
<br>
good but still gets yelled at anyway.  That is the best way I can put it.
<br>
<p>Despite everything, I still think if you tone things down a little and 
<br>
continue working diligently your goals may be realized.  You need to be 
<br>
physically and emotionally healthy to not burn out and have things fall 
<br>
apart.  The people of Norway and Scandinavia need what you may soon have to 
<br>
offer them!  So, don't let them down by burning bridges here.

<p>Trygve wrote:
<br>
I still think that by providing inexpensive temporary cold storage in
<br>
separate facilities while the built in problems get resolved, we would end 
<br>
up with more long run storage cases, and better quality on these as well. We 
<br>
would also set a precedence, so that it might be easier for relatives to 
<br>
freeze their relatives locally until longrun storage somewhere else can be 
<br>
worked out.
<br>
<p>And by having separate temporary short run storage facilities handle such
<br>
cases, no long run storage provider would be threatened by lawsuits etc.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I like your idea, but I wonder how many people have relatives who at the 
<br>
last minute could gather together the hefty funding necessary for a 
<br>
suspension and longterm storage contract?  I realize if only a few lives are 
<br>
eventually &quot;saved&quot; by your company then it will have all been worth it.  
<br>
Just remember, procrastination and cryonics do not mix well as Fred 
<br>
Chamberlain and Robert Ettinger could tell us with countless stories...
<br>
<p>Trygve, do you plan eventually to go beyond storage and actually carry out 
<br>
suspensions?  I would be curious to know.  A learned friend of mine, Robert 
<br>
Bradbury, says he is so confident mature nanotech will work that he would be 
<br>
willing to have his just cut off head dropped into a vat of liquid nitrogen 
<br>
and then taken straight to storage!  I hope I'm not giving you ideas here... 
<br>
;)
<br>
<p>Ettinger shared:
<br>
CI does routinely in fact, in appropriate cases, suggest preparation (when 
<br>
feasible) and temporary storage in dry ice at a funeral home. That is 
<br>
relatively cheap, and allows the family time to think it over and get 
<br>
advice.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>Aha!  A very practical man, I should have known Robert Ettinger would be 
<br>
doing this.  But, I can still conceive of a intermediate care storage 
<br>
facility for potential cryonics clients.
<br>
<p>Trygve in summation to us wrote:
<br>
My massive postings can also be seen as my attempt to wake up the cryonics 
<br>
movement to the the fact that our service to the many post mortem requests 
<br>
for cryonic suspensions have been dismal, and that cryonics would stand much 
<br>
stronger if we can find better ways to assist and utilize all the postmortem 
<br>
requests that so far for the most part have been turned down. Too many 
<br>
requests have been turned down without any publicity what so ever to support 
<br>
those who's interest in cryonics thereby have been crushed.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>Trygve, do you read Alcor's _Cryonics_ magazine?  I somehow doubt you do! 
<br>
lol  Fred and Linda Chamberlain have many times pleaded with readers to get 
<br>
their affairs in order in regards to having a cryonics policy.  And like 
<br>
most old testament prophets, their pleadings go sadly unheeded.
<br>
<p>And yet, maybe you are on to something.  As the saying goes, &quot;where there is 
<br>
a niche, go fill it.&quot;  You seem to be trying to do just that and it may have 
<br>
some interesting results.
<br>
<p>If you go to creating a full-service cryonics organization, perhaps you 
<br>
could do it on a Cryonics Institute like model.  But even on a simpler and 
<br>
cheaper scale by using crude but possibly still effective methods for 
<br>
suspension as I earlier mentioned.  You could charge let's say the 
<br>
equivalent of ten-thousand American dollars(or less?)...
<br>
<p>I know some will say only an Alcor level suspension is adequate.  But 
<br>
realistically, many people cannot afford it and so a much cheaper 
<br>
alternative could save lives.  This of course is only true if such a 
<br>
procedure preserves the body well enough that future technologies could 
<br>
successfully reanimate it.  This is a huge debate in and of itself on many 
<br>
levels...
<br>
<p>Anyway, I wish you luck in your endeavors and hope goodwill can be restored 
<br>
between you and the denizens of Cryonet.  And I hope you can live down the 
<br>
negatives of your past to prove my friend Charles Platt wrong.  Trygve, the 
<br>
people of Norway need you so do not let them down in terms of the good 
<br>
public relations, sound financing, general solid planning and personal 
<br>
health you will need to succeed in your storage venture.
<br>
<p>Time for me to go see the fireworks!  God bless America!
<br>
<p>very best wishes to you,
<br>
<p>John
