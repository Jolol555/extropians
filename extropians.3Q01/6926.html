<em>&gt; It is based on two big mistakes, one logical, one ethical. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical is most serious: you assume that human lives can have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative value, and do an essentially utilitarian calculation not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of happiness, but simply of utility towards a certain goal. Humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not promoting this goal are a vaste of resources and a potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat, so eliminate them. Hmm, sounds an awful lot like Skynet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and other evil Hollywood AIs. But why are you striving in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first place towards singularity? Clearly, it must be valuable in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some way.
</em><br>
<p>Though it is worse, and more difficult than this, Anders. Humans
<br>
actively fighting against this goal do have a negative value when their
<br>
actions cause the deaths of other humans.
<br>
<p>For instance, you know a person is a serial murderer, and is likely to
<br>
kill again, but there is no way to bring them to a court of law, or to
<br>
convict them if you do manage to get them that far.
<br>
<p>Is their death worth the risk to your own by taking responsibility for
<br>
killing them? Does their life not have a 'negative value'?
<br>
<p>The problem is whether an entire people can be considered to be 'serial
<br>
murderers'. In my opinion, the whole luddite/anti-globalist movement is
<br>
a mass of serial mass murderers. I cannot, however, get them convicted
<br>
for the everyday deaths of people which have not happened yet.
<br>
<p>There is also the problem that these murderers are mixed in with
<br>
millions and billions of completely innocent people who may or may not
<br>
sympathize to a greater or lesser degree with the overt claims and
<br>
rationalizations of the murderers, who do not even consider the lives of
<br>
people yet unconcieved to be worth defending at this point in time.
<br>
<p>This is a significant problem, because humans are generally evolved to
<br>
be stasist creatures, who are now living in a dynamist world. Most are
<br>
not equipped to rationally consider future lives lost against the
<br>
actions of those in the present, yet we all have 20/20 hindsight. How
<br>
many of us would refuse to try to kill Hitler in the trenches of WWI?
<br>
Yet back in the day, hardly anybody saw him as anything but a quaint
<br>
madman of little danger to anybody, until it was far too late.
<br>
<p>There were far more people who correctly foresaw the risks of communism,
<br>
yet still many more millions were killed off by it than by the scourge
<br>
of Naziism.
<br>
<p>Yet if I were to go back and kill off Marx, Engels, and their followers,
<br>
I'd be seen as the serial killer that still others would theorize could
<br>
be killed by a time traveller to make the world a better place. This
<br>
dillema was written of by Orson Scott Card in his novel 'Pastwatch',
<br>
where future civilization with an ability to observe the past discovers
<br>
that their timeline was created by a time traveller (who killed off the
<br>
billions of his own timeline to do so) who convinced Christopher
<br>
Columbus to travel west to discover (and thus exterminate the Aztecs
<br>
with diseases) the new world, rather than to go on and start a new
<br>
Crusade to the middle east. In the original timeline, it was the Aztec's
<br>
cannibalistic culture that decimated european culture.
<br>
<p>We have nowhere near the computing capacity to make anything like an
<br>
accurate guess about what are the correct actions to take in this new
<br>
era. We can see the past, but are powerless to change it once it occurs.
<br>
We are all powerful in determining the future, but are completely blind
<br>
in determining to the nth degree what the most proper course is to
<br>
follow. 
<br>
<p>All we can do is continue to rely on what we think is right and wrong,
<br>
while others act on what they consider to be right and wrong, and the
<br>
game will play out to its conclusion. All that matters is how well we
<br>
play the game by our own rules. Half-assedness is the only true crime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The core idea of transhumanism is human development, so that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can extend our potential immensely and become something new. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is based on the assumption that human life in whatever form it may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be (including potential successor beings) is valuable and worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something in itself. It must not be destroyed, because that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroys what transhumanism strives to preserve and enhance. Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if some humans are not helpful in achieving transhumanity doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean their existence is worthless, and if they are an active
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hindrance to your (or anybody elses) plans destroying their lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is always wrong as long as they do not initiate force against you.
</em><br>
<p>But given a situation where you have to choose, immediately, between the
<br>
life of a luddite and the life of an extrope, what do you choose?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This post is going to haunt us all - it is in the archives, it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been sent to hundreds of list participants. Be assured that in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few years, when the current uproar has settled down, somebody is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to drag it out and use it against extropianism in the media.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;So, Max More, is it true that *not all* extropians support the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plans for genocide you discussed on your internet list?&quot; After
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, I would be surprised if there are no representatives for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;luddites&quot; on this list.
</em><br>
<p>I think there are plenty of other posts that many of us would be
<br>
embarrassed about. I think that we do need to play out our thoughts,
<br>
support each other, and talk each other down to a semblance of sanity
<br>
again. I also think that history will likely be unable to distinguish
<br>
posts here from the frothing at the mouth that is occuring in far
<br>
greater vehemence elsewhere on the web. This is actually a rather tame
<br>
forum compared to many others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Frankly, I'm both scared and disgusted with much of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussions on this list over the last week. While the emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distress caused by the disaster is quite excusable, I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the behavior caused by it is excusable.
</em><br>
<p>In this case, you have millions of people watching a disaster who are
<br>
entirely powerless to do anything about it as it occurs, and in the
<br>
aftermath. Those of us who can do something do as much as we can, but in
<br>
most cases it still is not enough. I don't think that it has sunken in
<br>
enough what a greivous act this is, but perhaps this is one more
<br>
indication of how desensitized much of society has become to violence.
<br>
The rational evolved human animal reaction to such an event is to be
<br>
baying for the blood of the perpetrators, engaging in the pursuit and
<br>
execution, and holding their hide up to the world.
<br>
<p>I am frankly suprised that the reaction is as muted as it is. One might
<br>
therefore argue that video games make you less inclined to warmonger....
