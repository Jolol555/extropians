Terry W. Colvin fwded:
<br>
<em>&gt;If that's true, resistance will be, for the superbugs, futile. And even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's not true, the supposed `superbugs' provide no evidence at all that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have entered a new era of unprecedented malignancy--Gaia `fighting back',
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as some dopes like to think of it. It's just, at worst, a return to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ecological business as usual.
</em><br>
<p>Except ecological business as usual never used to include 
<br>
transcontinental flights, modern population densities and food 
<br>
monocultures. The bugs may be no more virulent than their ancestors, 
<br>
but they can spread far faster and infect far more. To put it simply, 
<br>
a plague in the Middle Ages might kill off a city, but would find it 
<br>
hard to spread beyond that - if it killed its hosts before they got 
<br>
to the next group of people it was pretty much done for. (OK, that's 
<br>
a LOT of simplification....)
<br>
<p>Also, in EBAU, the virulence of plagues is self-limiting. As noted 
<br>
above, if they're too virulent they'll kill their hosts before they 
<br>
spread too far. If they randomly mutate to a more virulent form, that 
<br>
form's not going to survive. But once you get into the high 
<br>
population densities and fast travel of the modern world, that 
<br>
doesn't apply anymore. If one does mutate that way it will still kill 
<br>
a lot faster, but it can spread fast and far enough to make up for it.
<br>
<p>Let's just hope the politicians don't get to ban genetic engineering.
<br>

<br>
ah-CHOO!
