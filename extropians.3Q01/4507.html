<p>Yes, its probably typical academic envy.  Its the same way many academics
<br>
treat Eric.  I don't know anything about Lord W. but I'd assume he and
<br>
most of the other &quot;peers&quot; he is talking about are 1-2 std. deviations
<br>
above average intelligence.  People like Michael and Eric are 3-4 std.
<br>
deviations above average intelligence and are so far ahead of their
<br>
&quot;peers&quot; that there isn't even any contest.  One of the things that
<br>
has become clearer and clearer to me over the last 5 or so years of
<br>
really digging into the work done by Eric, Ralph and Robert F. is
<br>
just how damn far ahead of the curve most of it really is.  We are
<br>
going to witness a number of people with their intelligence taking
<br>
these fields and moving them forward -- and all the while the bulk
<br>
of academia (and even the general population) will be going &quot;Oh no
<br>
that can't be done.&quot;.
<br>
<p>Its going to be really interesting -- I suspect we are going to end
<br>
up with a lot of engineers saying, &quot;Oh, I can build that&quot; all the
<br>
while a bunch of scientists are saying, &quot;Oh no you can't&quot; not on
<br>
the basis of any physical principles but simply because its never
<br>
been done before.
