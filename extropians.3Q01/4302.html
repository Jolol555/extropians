On 8/9/01 Lee Corbin responded to my comment of 8/7/01:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Once you realize that you are biased toward your candidate, you can correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your beliefs without elaborate use of reason.  Just move your beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the direction of beliefs favored by those who like the other candidate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you realize you have this option, and choose not to use it, I think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; admit to yourself that you are not really truth-seeking in this area.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That would only work if you had some confidence or faith in those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who liked the other candidate.  As an example, suppose that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do not believe in God, but wish to be as truth-seeking as possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It does not follow that you should &quot;move your beliefs in the direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of beliefs favored&quot; by those who are religious.  You may have concluded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that they are simply out to lunch for some reason (explanation).
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I had in mind the point you responded to that:
<br>
<em> &gt; maybe the fact that I wanted Gore to win was a much more important factor
</em><br>
<em> &gt; in determining my position on recounts.
</em><br>
<p>If you realize your position on recounts may be biased because you favor Gore,
<br>
you can correct for that by moving your position on recounts in the other
<br>
direction, even if you don't change your position on Gore at all.
<br>
<p>Of course I also want to argue that you should be very cautious in assuming
<br>
that people are out to lunch, and therefore hold uninformative opinions,
<br>
simply on the basis that they disagree with you on a particular point. Such
<br>
judgements, if made at all, should be based on a much wider consideration of
<br>
evidence of their rationality etc, and a similar analysis of how rational
<br>
you would look under such an analysis.
