<em>&gt; Hello everybody
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I' ve been pondering some questions about the concept of singularity
</em><br>
and its meaning in transhumanist philosophy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Certainly the term is a bit difficult to trace sometimes, since it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes from Teilhard de Chardins thoughts of the Omega- point (now that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a shaaaky fellow, but more on TDC some other time) and also from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tiplerite tradition, but I have seen also less &quot;mystical&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitions of the term.
</em><br>
<p>I think Teilhard never really proposed the singularity; his omega point
<br>
was simply the endpoint of history - a singular moment, but not linked
<br>
to any acceleration. Similarly, Frank Tipler's take on the omega point
<br>
is also the end of history (in this case literally, since it has to
<br>
occur at the last moment of the universe - there is an informal
<br>
&quot;theorem&quot; that says such infinite information states have to be at the
<br>
borders of the spacetime of the universe). Tipler does assume an
<br>
infinite acceleration of thought in his scenario, but it is very
<br>
different from the feedback process of improvement that Vernor Vinge
<br>
introduced.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, not all of us think that a singularity is possible- but is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desireable as a philosophical concept to be present in the discourse?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I ask my self: isn't the concept of a singularity the last grasp of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christian escathologism? That the concept of an unlimited development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; became a far too great leap, that you had to invent an end time? A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time after which progress would be so immense that discussion of it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be pointless, often with the discussion falling down into an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract paradise. But hasn't the introduction of escathology also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introduced the concept of immanentism in transhumanism, with all its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perils?
</em><br>
<p>I usually complain that people discussing the singularity often end up
<br>
sounding like theologicians or worse, millennialist believers. There is
<br>
a very real danger of the singularity acting as sticky fly paper in the
<br>
discussion, making everybody waste their energy in debating nanomachines
<br>
on a pin rather than how to get there. But at the same time the
<br>
singularity is a part of the large perspective of transhumanism, trying
<br>
to look at human history on the biggest scale and asking what long-range
<br>
possibilities there are. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Virtue is achieved through action, actions that may be very,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very, very much more complex than ours- but there is still action
</em><br>
<em>&gt;required to achieve virtue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Omega- point seen as inert, thus it is not virtuous. Thus the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Omega point is not a state of Eudaimonia.
</em><br>
<p>I think you mix up the singularity and the omega point quite a bit. Here
<br>
are the definitions from my terminology page: 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Omega Point: A possible future state when intelligence controls
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Universe totally, and the amount of information processed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stored goes asymptotically towards infinity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singularity: The postulated point or short period in our future
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when our self-guided evolutionary development accelerates
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enormously (powered by nanotechnology, neuroscience, AI, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps uploading) so that nothing beyond that time can reliably
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be conceived.
<br>
<p>Note that unless the singularity leads to some magical technology that
<br>
enables an omega point at once (and this is very unlikely for physical
<br>
reasons) the post-singularity state will not be omniscient. 
<br>
<p>The omega point is also a limit point rather than a state - properly
<br>
speaking the important thing is the growth of information towards
<br>
infinity. If you read Tipler's analysis of how to achieve this, you will
<br>
see that it involves tremendous action - the entire universe has to be
<br>
remade, and a literally infinite number of challenges at increasingly
<br>
higher energies have to be overcome. There is plenty of space for
<br>
eudaimonia in the approach to omega. 
<br>
<p>But you are right about the dangers of spending our time dreaming of
<br>
jupiter brains when there are real brains to use right here. Some far
<br>
range speculations have relevant consequences close at home - &quot;Is
<br>
nanotech so dangerous it has to be banned?&quot; , for example - and they can
<br>
and should be analysed with the best intellectual tools we have. But I
<br>
think more positive results can be achieved through applying the here
<br>
and now (and soon) knowledge, technology and ideas we have to create a
<br>
world where unbounded progress is possible.
