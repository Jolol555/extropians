<p>Possibly. But you might imagine that it would work the other way around:
<br>
the more vulnerable you are, the more you'd need to pump and puff up your
<br>
amour propre.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; But the idea of Americans as driven only by some crisp pragmatic

</em><br>
<p>I know. That's what I was saying.
<br>
<p>I can't argue this appropriately here, because it's such a massive task;
<br>
all I can do is gesture toward the corpora of, say, Noam Chomsky and
<br>
Fredric Jameson (especially the latter's THE POLITICAL UNCONSCIOUS, which
<br>
relentlessly explores the masked ideologemes in literary formations). Of
<br>
course Chomsky is a left anarchist, and Jameson is a [post?]marxist, so
<br>
perhaps their elaborate analyses can be dismissed unread. (That would
<br>
certainly be easier; they are difficult writers.)
