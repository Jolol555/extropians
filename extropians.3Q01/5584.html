Tim Maroney said (to me)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I guess you don't hang around in the science fiction community much. (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't any more, but I used to.) What I'm seeing here politically is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by-the-book fanboy libertarianism.
</em><br>
<p>Tim, I have a small but perfectly formed &lt;g&gt; body of professional work
<br>
published in the sf and fantasy field in Australia, the US, the UK and
<br>
Italy, and am an active member of SFWA. I am also a paid up member of SFRA
<br>
(the Science Fiction Research Association, for the academic study of the
<br>
genre). I count among my friends Joe Haldeman, William Gibson, Gregory
<br>
Benford, Kim Stanley Robinson, Ellen Datlow and various other people whom
<br>
you'd have heard of in the North American sf community. I have *a lot* of
<br>
friends in the local sf community including well-known writers such as
<br>
Damien Broderick. I ran a large chunk of the programming for the 1999 world
<br>
sf convention (held here in Melbourne) and later used the papers and
<br>
transcripts to co-edit a special Aussie issue of the British sf journal
<br>
_Foundation_. I've been to a number of worldcons overseas (hmmm, though
<br>
admittedly only one in the US - otherwise, I've been to worldcons in the Uk
<br>
and the Netherlands) as well as a large number of conventions here in
<br>
Australia, including two worldcons.
<br>
<p>I am very active in the sf community in Australia and have co-written a book
<br>
on the history of Australian sf (published in the US by Greenwood Press if
<br>
anyone wants to go out and buy a copy).
<br>
<p>And on and on...
<br>
<p>In short, I am actually very familiar with the international sf community.
<br>
What you are describing is a small sub-set of the sf community based around
<br>
the work of Jerry Pournelle and a few others. It may seem largish in the US,
<br>
but it is almost non-existent in Australia and I think you'd find the same
<br>
in Britain and any of the European countries. There is, admittedly, a
<br>
libertarian streak in the group of American hard sf writers led by Benford,
<br>
Greg Bear and David Brin - but it's only a streak. These people are far more
<br>
complex thinkers than that.
<br>
<p>So my question remains. Why does the extrolist show the same mentality as
<br>
one sub-set of sf fandom, whereas the sf-related lists I've been on have
<br>
shown a totally different mentality?
<br>
