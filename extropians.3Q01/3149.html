This is perhaps not the wisest attitude.  People generally have a 
<br>
finite amount of attention to devote to details ... whatever they 
<br>
choose to consider details.  Many of those don't have very much to 
<br>
do with (what I choose to consider) extropianism.  There are 
<br>
clearly reasonable definitions which would include all those 
<br>
factors, but any such group, in order to properly forcast it's 
<br>
focus area, would need to largely dismiss some of the others as 
<br>
&quot;inappropriate for this group&quot;.  There's just too much information 
<br>
available to consider large areas in detail.
<br>
<p>It was said earlier that &lt;plonk&gt;ing someone was a kind of self 
<br>
censorship.  And this is true.  It's also true, however, that any 
<br>
individual will need to restrict the focus of their awareness.  I 
<br>
have never read a complete copy of the London Times.  Not even the 
<br>
daily.  There are good arguments as to why it might be a good thing 
<br>
for me to do this occasionally, but I've always found something 
<br>
else that I would rather devote my attention to.
