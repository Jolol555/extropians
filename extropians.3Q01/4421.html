<p>A few years back it really looked liked we were getting an open source
<br>
virtual sandbox to study dynamics of small and not so small molecules and
<br>
assemblies of such interactively. Sadly, the efforts fizzled, so we're now
<br>
limited to the efforts of a few academic researchers, in toto a few warm
<br>
bodies, and with a biology, not nano bias.
<br>
<p>Computers are plenty fast now, even if you're not talking about a cluster.
<br>
We really need something painless, which lets people tweak atoms
<br>
interactively, and see what that stuff does, and interacts. Once we've
<br>
made a few interesting things in machina, we can start trying to make
<br>
them, and to see whether they would work in reality.
