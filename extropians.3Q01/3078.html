<em>&gt; Okay, no one is saying you're a white supremacist. However, all these

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Actually, according to FBI data, poverty IS a more accurate indicator of
<br>
crime propensity, however, doing some plotting of race vs income and
<br>
crime shows that blacks are more likely to commit crime at higher income
<br>
levels than whites as well. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, this is the beginning of the argument, not the end of it. What do we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do about social structures that contain such an underclass? What do we do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about its racial skewing? Also, there's an argument about what *can* we do
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, my personal opinion is that education is the prime problem, and
<br>
the prime solution. The common saying among black kids today is that
<br>
'books are for whites'. That sort of racial/cultural aversion to
<br>
knowledge and learning to me seems to be the prime contributor to the
<br>
vicious cycle of poverty, crime, and hate.
