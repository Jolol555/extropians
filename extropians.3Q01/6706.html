<em>&gt; about Falwell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Robertson, have we any secondary proof that they really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said those words?  I can see where someone could post disinfo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that could be innocently picked up and reposted.  Did anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually hear the broadcast or offer a major news org that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confirms it?
</em><br>
<p>That part of the speech by Falwell was broadcast on KGO yesterday (the 15th).
<br>
I
<br>
heard it, and it confirms that Falwell believes the atrocity of September 11,
<br>
2001 was god's way of punishing America for its sins. Falwell has been roundly
<br>
criticized by many journalists and commentators for his religious fanatic
<br>
remarks about this incident.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am surprised as hell that two players as politically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; savvy as these two clowns would say such a thing.
</em><br>
<p>Don't be surprised by anything religious fanatics say or do. Remember that it
<br>
was religious fanatics who committed the WTC and Pentagon attacks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hafta know it would blow up in their faces to use this tragedy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a chance to ride a political hobby horse.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Religionism is a brain disease which precludes concern about consequences in
<br>
the real world, as the suicidal hijacking zealots' actions prove.
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
