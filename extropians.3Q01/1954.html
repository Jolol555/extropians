<em>&gt; This is an article about, well, people believing odd things.  Superstitions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religions, etc.
</em><br>
<p>It's an excellent article, and Joel Garreau is correct in stating.
<br>
&quot;[...] rational, fact-based projections into the near future are
<br>
indistinguishable from science fiction. Steven Spielberg's new film, &quot;A.I.,&quot;
<br>
is based on the work of scientists like Ray Kurzweil, who has nine honorary
<br>
doctorates, has been awarded honors by two U.S. presidents, and was named
<br>
inventor of the year by MIT. He projects that machines will transcend mortal
<br>
brainpower within 20 years.&quot;
<br>
Although &quot;transcend&quot; is probably an unfortunate choice of terminology, it does
<br>
appear that machines will become smarter than people in a generation or two
<br>
(thus making uploaded personalities the property of alien intelligence).
<br>
<p>Where the Extropians list tends to go off the deep end is with threads like:
<br>
&quot;Subject: Re: Believe in God - add a decade to your life&quot; with choirs
<br>
(reminiscent of Planet of The Apes) singing reverent lyrics.
<br>
That's how people get the idea it's a cult.
<br>
<p>Garreau's article continues:
<br>
&quot;In my view, human civilization will come to accept that there's not much
<br>
difference between information processing in biological brains or
<br>
non-biological,&quot; Kurzweil says. &quot;That's a political prediction.&quot;
<br>
To which I'd add that machine intelligence which exceeds mortal brainpower is
<br>
biology conducted by other means. Just because a system uses inorganic
<br>
materials instead of organic ones doesn't make it non-biological. The really
<br>
savvy futurists are those who will transform themselves into something greater
<br>
than selfish brutes, instead of dreaming about immortalizing their petty egos
<br>
in uploaded personalities.
<br>
That's a non-political prediction.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, and ego.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
