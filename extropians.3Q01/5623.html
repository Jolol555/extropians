<p>I must say that I came by ExI by rather different means, albiet I did
<br>
find the group on the internet. I was doing a web search in 1994 or so
<br>
for a friend, of websites on Rome, as he wanted to take a vacation there
<br>
and wanted to find places to stay, visit, etc. Upon typing &quot;Rome&quot; into
<br>
the search engine, the top of the list was the &quot;Romana Machado World
<br>
Headquarters&quot;. Turns out that Romana was an early extrope, a programmer
<br>
at Apple, etc. and although the extropians list wasn't available to
<br>
non-members at the time, the transhumanist email list was, and
<br>
eventually I did join ExI and the list.
<br>
<p>Prior to that point, I had never gone to an SF convention, though I'd
<br>
read a goodly amount of SF as a teenager, nor was I into comic books at
<br>
all. Heinlein and Rand were some heavy philosophical influences for me
<br>
though, despite Rand's terrible literary style.
<br>
<p>Fanboy? No, nor a faaan, but I did find Niven's &quot;Falling Angels&quot;
<br>
entertaining. I still have never been to an SF convention (or a comic
<br>
book con, or other sort). Extro-5 is the first non-industrial convention
<br>
I've ever been to. I tend to not be a 'joiner', or a follower.
<br>
<p>I suppose the closest indictable offense is that I came from the
<br>
technology venture culture of Seattle, but I am not native to that area,
<br>
nor have I lived there for 6 years, and I was generally an outsider
<br>
while I was there.
