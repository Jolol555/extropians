<p><em>&gt; I liked this test much more that the WSPQ, as it is much more

<em>&gt; Authoritarian/Libertarian: -5.49; in other words, I am (as I knew) a

</em><br>
<p>I couldn't take this test!  I had to give up after only four questions!
<br>
Here they are:  (for each, your only choices are strongly agree, agree,
<br>
disagree, and strongly disagree)
<br>
<p>1. If globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity
<br>
rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.
<br>
<p>Well, Jesus!  The assumption is that the interests of the trans-national
<br>
corporations are antithetical to those of humanity!  Good grief!  Was
<br>
the WSPQ (World's Shortest Political Quiz) this loaded, and I simply
<br>
couldn't recognize it because I'm a libertarian?  This is scary!
<br>
<p>2. I'd always support my country, whether it was right or wrong. 
<br>
<p>And what does **support** mean?  Defend physically, or refuse to
<br>
criticize?  Clearly the answer that the test tries very, very hard
<br>
to get out of one is &quot;disagree&quot;, or &quot;disagree strongly&quot;.
<br>
<p>3. No one chooses their country of birth, so it's absurd to be
<br>
proud of it.
<br>
<p>Absurd?  While this question isn't as absurd as the first two,
<br>
this is hardly the right word here.
<br>
<p>4. Our nation has many unique virtues.
<br>
<p>Perhaps not such a bad question.
<br>
<p>5. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
<br>
<p>Okay
<br>
<p>6. Jews surely have to take some of the responsibility for
<br>
their persecution over the past 2000 years.
<br>
<p>So how can one possibly answer that if he or she believes
<br>
that Jews must take a small share of the responsibility,
<br>
say five or ten percent?  Why, one must then *agree*, because
<br>
that's what the word &quot;some&quot; means.  But then one is immediately
<br>
implicated, (or self-implicated, depending on one's temperament)
<br>
as an anti-Semite.
<br>
<p>6. The growing fusion between information and entertainment
<br>
is a worrying contribution to the public's shrinking attention span. 
<br>
<p>So does &quot;worrying&quot; mean that one wishes to regulate it?  Luckily,
<br>
I gave up on this quiz two questions back, and don't have to think
<br>
about it.
<br>
<p>Seriously:  I do *not* remember anyone complaining about the
<br>
tendentiousness of the questions on the former quizzes.  PLEASE
<br>
say so if you *did* have any problem with those earlier quizzes.
<br>
