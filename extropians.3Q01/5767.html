</em><br>

<p>Actually, the cell phone is a specific example of a more general
<br>
phenomenon: a great deal of recent innovation revolves around the
<br>
computer and the integrated circuit. These two related technologies
<br>
follow Moore's law. In the pre-computer era, identifiable innovations
<br>
were less dependent on a single driver, so there were many of them.
<br>
Since 1951, We have had the equivalent of a fundamental breakthrough
<br>
in computing and in semiconductors every two years, and each of these
<br>
breakthroughs is equivalent to e.g. the invention of the telephone
<br>
or the telegraph or the airplane in terms of societal impact.
<br>
<p><p>Before you disagree, please consider the relative improvement in
<br>
electronics today versus the improvement in automotive or airplane
<br>
technology during the most rapid portions of their respective
<br>
developments.  Basically I feel that the difference is that
<br>
inventors tend to exploit the areas of maximum potential or
<br>
innovation. Today, these areas are overwhelmingly driven
<br>
by electronics and computing, so most inventors are programmers
<br>
and EEs.
