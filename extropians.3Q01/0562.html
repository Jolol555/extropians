<em>&gt; &gt; Arrg. Where to start?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hi M. E.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, if you don't want to start at the beginning, we can start at the end:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is funny (to me) that this argument about religion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recurs on a yearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; basis on this list. &quot;Methinks he doth protest too much.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sounds like a personal problem (and probably not just to me), but not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly funny one. I protest that you do think too little. This argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about religiosity recurs annually (or more often) because religiosity is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perennial weed in the gardens of extropy and transhumanism. To prevent this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noxious weed taking over and strangling the useful plants, application of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industrial strength weed killer does not seem inappropriate.
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't plan to take weed killer to your ideas or even to your
<br>
obnoxious heavy-handedness and implied violence to what others
<br>
find important.  So I would appreciate it if you would consider
<br>
not making such blanket condemnations or threats. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I admit that the book in question (&quot;Why God Won't Go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Away&quot;) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; annoying in the sense that it frequently goes out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; its way to present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; its findings in the language of Western religion (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; title being an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; example of this), but I assume you actually did more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than read the title.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right, the dangerous and irresponsible nature of religiosity, causing (as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has) over five thousand wars in the last three thousand years, requires more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than reading. That's why &quot;drastic measures&quot; are appropriate. When dealing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain dysfunction, medication does a better job.
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me but there are many, many causes of wars.  They cannot
<br>
all or even mostly be laid at the feet of religion.  Often
<br>
religion is simply one of many excuses.  I would also point out
<br>
that religions have done quite a bit to promote peace and
<br>
coherent societies.  It is not a one-sided phenomenon by any
<br>
means.  But of course, it is your function to flame away rather
<br>
than really apprehending anything that causes you some ire.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Religious fanatics are dishonest if they are not mentally ill, because only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychologically disturbed people could believe the childish mythology of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miracles and fantasy that makes up religionism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Would you consider everyone who believes in God or find prayer
<br>
helpful for sorting themselves out at least to be &quot;mentally
<br>
ill&quot;? If so, please explicate your criteria for mental health. 
<br>
<p>Miracles?  Through science and technology we can or soon will be
<br>
able to do nearly every &quot;miracle&quot; listed.  Will we also have the
<br>
values in place, the ethics, the wisdom to use those abilities
<br>
reasonably?  Where exactly will we get these values and this
<br>
wisdom?  How will we create and spread memes that promote a
<br>
society we want to live in in the face of this increasing rate
<br>
of change and growth in both power and consequences?  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I put it to you that the findings of the authors of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; WGWGA support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this bit of &quot;religiosity&quot;. Therefore, your mentioning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of this book,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the context of &quot;Debunk All Religiosity Equally&quot;, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wierd to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I suppose dealing with reason does feel &quot;weird&quot; to religious fanatics. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be irrational to think that religiosity can be debunked sufficiently to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remove it from the ailing brain in which it resides. Therefore, one can even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagine brains addled by religion hallucinating that the authors of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _Why God Won't Go Away: Brain Science and the Biology of Belief_,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Andrew Newberg, Eugene D'Aquili, and Vince Rause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ballantine, New York, 2001. 234 pp. $24.95, C$37.95. ISBN: 0-345-44033-1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in any way &quot;support&quot; religiosity.
</em><br>
<p><p>Define this bogus term &quot;religiosity&quot; without bombastic rhetoric
<br>
please.  I will tell you this.  I find an incredible peace and
<br>
groundedness within meditation that makes a profound difference
<br>
in my balance and effectiveness in real life.  And that peace is
<br>
quite precious to me whether I can explain it away or catalog
<br>
its neuroligical correlates or not.  Whatever this is it also
<br>
increases my patience and opens up my heart to (generally) hear
<br>
others on a deeper level.  If you want to call that sort of
<br>
thing &quot;mental illness&quot; or label me a &quot;religious fanatic&quot; then go
<br>
right ahead.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is arguably a central premise of certain religions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nice to be rid of &quot;the whole darn tormenting thing&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that is our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sense of being a separate &quot;Self&quot;, and that furthermore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; freedom is possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unless you are arguing with your &quot;Self,&quot; the sense of separation is neither a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premise nor arguable. Anyone with enough courage and honesty can conduct this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment right now. It has _nothing_ to do with religionism. It has to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with direct experience of reality. Simply allow all imagination and words to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cease and desist, to fall out of view, to precipitate away from your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention, while you remain wide awake and alert, and suddenly it becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear that you are the world, all at once the constraints of dogma and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doctrine evaporate and you are free, and the walls that belief systems have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put together fall down to reveal endless liberation in all directions. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more a matter of seeing than of thinking. Religiosity, in stark contrast to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this, is the first and last psychological prison of humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ah.  The above is quite spiritual.  Very Zen or basically
<br>
Buddhist in flavor.  So you do have use for spirituality just
<br>
not for systems of dogma and doctrine.  I agree utterly. 
<br>
Spirituality is experiencing and standing in relation to, it is
<br>
not believing a bunch of things because they are the doctrine or
<br>
dogma.   Perhaps we have no argument after all.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's very wierd (to me) that you even brought up this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (excellent)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; book in this context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it is the context which matters most. In the context of a world mad with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious wars, where religionists are willing to die for the memes that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infected their brains, where the security of the entire planet is threatened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by zealouts who deliberately attempt to fulfill the apocalyptic prophecies of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their sacred scriptures (at the expense of anyone who gets in their way),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where Inquisitions and witchhunts seek to silence every voice of reason, where
</em><br>
<p>Some of the things you speak of above are antiques much like
<br>
other antiques from our past.  That some are still caught by
<br>
them is regrettable but is not a general condemnation of all
<br>
religion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; infallible popery masquerades as compassion, where innocent children are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taught to hate and kill anyone who does not embrace their parents pious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fanaticism, where parochialism and provincialism spawn divisiveness 
</em><br>
<p>Most religious people do not teach anything of the kind.
<br>
<p><p>in the
<br>
<em>&gt; name of diversity, where nearly the whole human race is cognitively crippled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and lives in fear of tyrants who threaten damnation and eternal hell for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disobeying asinine religious edicts, where ceremony and tradition stifle
</em><br>
<p>I think you are getting a bit carried away.  Many religions and
<br>
many people in even relgiions that do have hellfire and
<br>
damnation memes, don't believe in anything of the kind.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; original ideas and new solutions, it becomes clear why the phrase &quot;to make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion out of it&quot; means to alienate from freedom something that was once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beautiful and to deform it into an ugly form of psychological death.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Religion at its worse does this.  Religion at its best uncovers
<br>
the beauty and liberates it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The &quot;usual&quot; sense of self no doubt won out in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Darwinian sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because it drives us to actions which ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; result in more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; offspring, but then, obviously, so does the &quot;usual&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; state of our sex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; drives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, this is not at all &quot;obvious&quot; because our sex drives do not drive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Darwinism, Neo-Darwinian evolution, Deep Evolution, nor our sense of self. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best way to transcend biological drives is to indulge them to the point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satiety, when doing so harms no one. The anti-sex facet of 
</em><br>
<p>The indulgence to satiety has been tried on different drives and
<br>
emotions.  The results were not that good.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;religiosity results
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in repression, which leads to all sorts of perverse sexual behavior as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pent-up libido must find an outlet. That may explain why there are so many sex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perverts and pedophiles in monasteries, churches, temples, and mosques. Sexual
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me but you don't find any more perverts (whatever that is
<br>
and isn't) or pedohiles in these places than anywhere else. 
<br>
Much less on average.  But the ones who are there stand out much
<br>
more. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; liberation threatens religionists because their particular type of bigotry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denies sex and sexuality, and this denial is yet another indication of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dishonesty and irresponsibility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Without coming down for or against one view of the right sexual
<br>
stance for optimal well-being or another, the above is quite
<br>
one-sided.  I have been both libertine and celibate (and
<br>
everything in between) in my life and I have learned different
<br>
things from each possibility.  There were times in my life where
<br>
the entire sex-thing seemed to tie me to a lot of nonsense that
<br>
wasn't conducive to what I really cared about.   Sometimes in my
<br>
libertine period it seemd like the more I loved sexually the
<br>
more I learned to reach that place of wonderful openness with
<br>
the lover and the more I craved opening to that place with far
<br>
more people than I could ever be lovers with.  And the sex/love
<br>
tangle of this kind of mammal gets pretty messy sticky quite
<br>
quickly.  And sometimes the energy simply wants to express in
<br>
other ways and sex is a distraction.  I also know from
<br>
experience that sexual sublimation has some positive benefits
<br>
and is not at all the same as repression.
<br>
<p>Many religious paths argue for minimizing sexual activity
<br>
because they find it is one of the principle linchpins that hook
<br>
people into their fixed personalities and personal/societal
<br>
games.  They attempt to to some degree remove this linchpin. 
<br>
This is not that unreasonable a tactic from my own experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Thus, &quot;unusual&quot; brain states in which the boundaries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of our &quot;self&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are radically altered are not neccessarily &quot;less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; representations&quot; of reality. Perhaps they are like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equally valid reference frames involved when doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simple analyses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the kinematics of playing tennis on a moving train,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps you need to have a good orgasm to dispel these delusions. Sadly, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most &quot;unusual&quot; brain state in the world is one completely free of esoteric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speculation about reality. &quot;Different but equally valid reference frames&quot; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no substitute for the real thing, particularly when analyzing anything about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving trains. If you ever come to your senses, you'll find that it radically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alters your analyses, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What is the &quot;real thing&quot;?  It is experiential if I read what you
<br>
said above correctly.  Then is it communicable or only availabel
<br>
through experience, e.g. through a state of mind/consciousness?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An important thing to understand is that the brain is the part of reality that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has mistakenly considered itself a mystical essence instead of the organ of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perception. If it is not obvious to you why an accurate representation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality requires a dynamic and pancritical rationalism, it is thankfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understandble to those who have tried to make it more obvious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is not obvious to me what you mean by &quot;pancritical
<br>
rationalism&quot;. Your words don't often fit what that phrase
<br>
implies to me.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Meditation does _not_ mean the same thing as religiosity. It is religiosity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that needs debunking, not meditation. When neuroscience can pinpoint the area
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the brain that causes the dangerous and all too often violent behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associated with religious fanaticism, then it will have rendered a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beneficial service than locating areas of the brain which are active during
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed meditation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Wouldn't it be simpler to simply accentuate the memes that
<br>
eliminate this tendency toward violence or very effectively
<br>
control it?  Some of them are found in various spiritual
<br>
practices.  Some are found in various other practices and
<br>
trainings.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The book in question is in the same general genre as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Austin's &quot;Zen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the Brain&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The two books are in the same general category because they were both written
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by authors who did not themselves directly experience the epiphenomenon of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which they write. While this seems laudable in that it appears to preserve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific objectivity, it corresponds to someone who has never had an orgasm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing a book about love and sex.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In the case of Austin, you are quite mistaken.  He practiced Zen
<br>
for many years and became interested in the project to
<br>
understand what was happening to him and in other Zen
<br>
practictioners neurologically when various states and
<br>
experiences occurred in meditation.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please re-read the subject line. It reads &quot;Debunk All Religiosity...&quot; Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over-reaction and defensiveness shows how weak you must feel. It shows in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way you twist this into &quot;wiped out (through force?).&quot; To reiterate, &quot;mystical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences&quot; do not equate to religiosity. Debunk means &quot;to render ineffective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  by exposing the false pretensions of,&quot; according to my dictionary... which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I've done about you. Since you are a troll, go back to lurking. Welcome
