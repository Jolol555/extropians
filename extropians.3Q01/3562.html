<p><em>&gt;&gt; Yeah, anyone who doesn't support rent-a-riot

<em>&gt;&gt; they are Uncle Toms....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suppose this makes some kind of sense to someone,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The sarcasm did make sense to me, Loree.  But this is
<br>
very typical of the way that when executed without
<br>
any backup redundantcy, confusion results.  In other
<br>
words, they were no longer talking to you, but only
<br>
congratulating each other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems not only nonsensical (what the heck is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rent-a-riot?) but non sequitur and vicious well past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point of any possible provocation as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; thing is &quot;sequitur&quot;, but vicious, mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and indicative of poor debating skills.
</em><br>
<p>It was *not* vicious!  They were saying that it is a 
<br>
shame that black people are called &quot;Uncle Toms&quot; whenever
<br>
they fail to support liberal politics (which may or may
<br>
not be true, but is besides the point of your question).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I could also construe this to mean that you just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claimed I AM a supporter of rent-a-riot politics...
</em><br>
<p>You had in effect said, &quot;black cops can be racist towards
<br>
black people&quot;, and then Mike Lorrey sarcastically said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Yeah, anyone who doesn't support rent-a-riot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; politics must be racists, and if they are black,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; they are Uncle Toms....
</em><br>
<p>meaning that cops (who don't support rent-a-riot politics)
<br>
are merely a subset of all the people who don't support
<br>
rent-a-riot politics, and that these people are shamelessly
<br>
labelled &quot;racist&quot;.  This didn't *have to* logically include
<br>
you, but the confusion here follows exactly from his heavy
<br>
use of sarcasm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; which you make clear is a bad thing and thus meant to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a personal insult.  Add to that the defamation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherent by your implication that I would call any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>No, as I said, it turns out that he absolutely never meant
<br>
to say or imply that.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We were doing so good before this Mike.  Why did you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to bring it down to this level?
</em><br>
<p>Impatience, I think.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That effectively ends the discussion, at least from my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side.  Feel free to carry on by yourself.
</em><br>
<p>I hope that you resume.  You were very much helping by
<br>
disagreeing with Jerry and Mike.  But when you wrote
<br>
the one-line 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Not such a trick at all.  Happens constantly.
</em><br>
<p>you were setting up a scenario of some quick rather
<br>
thoughtless exchanges.  If you had fleshed this out
<br>
with even *two* complete sentences, very possibly
<br>
the misunderstanding would not have materialized.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So Lee?  You've been championing reasoned discourse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lately.  How do you feel about this post of Mike's?
</em><br>
<p>I've just said.  I hope that I was able to throw some
<br>
light on the exchange.
<br>
<p>Lee
