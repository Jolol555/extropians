<em>&gt; &gt; I've spent 4 years as lurker on this list and this is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most viciously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; racist comment I've ever seen, although I've seen a lot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is offensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from Mr Lorry this tops them all. I tend to agree with Alex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bokovs analysis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of how this list operates, what he misses is that so-called 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dogmatism and rigidity quickly descends into intolerance 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and bigotry as we
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suppose my taking great offense at you misspelling my last name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (typical freakin' englishman) would fall on deaf ears. I'd expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone who claims to have lurked on this list for 4 years would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some idea of how to spell my rather simple name.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also take great offense to you claiming this is a racist comment. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly is insensitive, and reflects stereotypes, but I doubt very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much you'd say it was racist if it was said by a black person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that a prominent black comedian said this very line in on of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skits on 'In Living Color').
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The truest test of whether a statement is racist is if it offends no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter who says it. If one person can say it as a joke and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get a pass on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, and another person says it and it offends, it's not racist.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly why I wrote of having clear definitions of the words we use... I can
<br>
see this degrading to the point where I say to my kids &quot;You children cant
<br>
clean your room... Could you be more racist!&quot;?!  Lets just start throwing
<br>
the term at every negative thing we can find just cause it sounds so cool
<br>
when we use it. Damn racists cant use their dictionaries....
