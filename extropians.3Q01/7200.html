Sorry, I can't see a rope being much better than jumping.  Do they make
<br>
fold-up pocket parachutes/paragliders?
<br>
================
<br>
a)  Good rope would be useful for going down the exterior of the building
<br>
as long as you didn't drop it on a side that was on fire...
<br>
and you were good at rapelling down tall cliffs quickly, without falling...
<br>
<p>b) Yes, they make small, easily portable parachutes.  Someone sent around
<br>
some info about them on some list...  I'll see if I can find it if anyone
<br>
is interested.  However, to land without risk of serious injury or death
<br>
you need some parachuting training / experience...
<br>
<p>Basically, regardless of HOW you plan to get out of an endangered high
<br>
rise building, you need to figure it out well in advance and practice
<br>
doing it quickly and safely.
<br>
<p>Many of the people who had done that after the previous WTC bombing did
<br>
get out, provided they were not trapped by fire.  Exterior escapes for
<br>
such a trapped-by-fire situation, though, would require more training.
<br>
<p>By the way, a guy named George Willig once climbed the WTC by hand
<br>
(using home-made handles that went into the window washing tracks, not
<br>
rope), and a guy named Owen J. Quinn parachuted from the top of the
<br>
building to the street.  (There's a brief article about this, and
<br>
Philippe Petit's tight rope walk between the towers, in Sports
<br>
Illustrated this week...)
<br>
<p>LL+P,
<br>
Stephan
