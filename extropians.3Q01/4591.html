<p><p>The timeline is relevant here, and in many cases the people in the Americas

were peaceful as an economic necessity.  Many of the vast and diverse
<br>
resources taken for granted in the U.S. today were not discovered/exploited
<br>
until the 19th century.  For the first two centuries of settlement in North
<br>
America, the economy was desperately dependent on foreign trade for many
<br>
essential goods and materials due to a lack of known domestic resources at
<br>
the time.  The development of a competent maritime trading tradition in the
<br>
U.S. was the result of dire necessity in the early years.
<br>
<p>Ironically, some of the biggest imports in early America were things
<br>
necessary to effectively wage war, such as gunpowder, gold, and silver (the
<br>
latter two leaving the U.S. in a constant currency crisis until the
<br>
discovery of vast quantities of these materials in the unpopulated West).
<br>
This put the U.S. in a position that is in some ways similar to Japan in the
<br>
first half of the 20th century, being forced to trade with countries for the
<br>
goods that would allow military opposition to the same countries.  However,
<br>
unlike Japan, we eventually *did* discover huge domestic resources that
<br>
allowed us to engage in warfare with far less risk to our economy.  (Japan
<br>
of course had to carefully acquire such resources through warfare.)
