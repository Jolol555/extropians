<p>We're getting a lot of stuff forwarded here lately.  It's interesting to
<br>
read the varied perspectives, but much of it is of questionable quality.
<br>
I wish people would add some commentary or something to put it into
<br>
perspective.  It was very helpful to learn that that one paranoid guy
<br>
was a believer in UFOs.
<br>
<p>I looked at this Chronicles magazine website.  It is published by a
<br>
religious, right-wing, Christian think tank.  They appear to be very
<br>
hostile to Islam.  I gather from the quoted article that they objected
<br>
to the U.S. support for Muslims and opposition to the Serbs in the
<br>
Balkan conflict.
<br>
<p>As I recall events, international aid organizations spent months trying
<br>
to build public awareness of the mistreatment by Muslims at the hands
<br>
of Bosnian Serbs.  I thought it was courageous for the U.S. to oppose
<br>
the European group that we have more cultural ties with and support the
<br>
more foreign Muslims.
<br>
<p>In any case, the story being presented doesn't hang together all that
<br>
well.  We were supporting bin Laden as recently as 1998?  Would he really
<br>
hate the U.S. so much if so?  Would he have been targeting car bombs at
<br>
American soldiers when they were fighting on his side against the Serbs?
<br>
<p>It's hard to pick out the nuggets of truth in an article which is
<br>
published by a magazine with an explicit anti-Muslim bias.
<br>
