[ Apologies in advance for not very extropian content ]
<br>
<p>Or should that be, &quot;Idiot-in-Chief&quot;?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I don't like Dubya, but up until today I've had the impression that he
<br>
was handling this crisis reasonably well -- not brilliantly, but
<br>
competently. (Which is all we can ask for of any president, really.)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Then he had to go and use the C-word in a public speech: &quot;crusade&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I'm speechless. Really, I am.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Hasn't he been paying *ANY* attention to what's going on? And why didn't
<br>
his minders stop him from using that fatal word? All you have to do is
<br>
read Osama bin Laden's original declaration of war on the west (which
<br>
you can find at <a href="http://www.emergency.com/bladen98.htm">http://www.emergency.com/bladen98.htm</a>)  to realise that
<br>
ObL's political position is that the west is waging a Crusade -- in the
<br>
historical sense of the word -- against Islam.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In that fatwa, Osama bin Laden wrote &quot;The Arabian Peninsula has never --
<br>
since God made it flat, created its desert, and encircled it with seas --
<br>
been stormed by any forces like the crusader armies spreading in it like
<br>
locusts, eating its riches and wiping out its plantations.&quot; Then he went
<br>
on to say, &quot;all these crimes and sins committed by the Americans are a
<br>
clear declaration of war on God, his messenger, and Muslims.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It's there, clear as day: Osama bin Laden's whole program is to accuse
<br>
the Americans of waging a Crusade -- a holy war against Islam, and to
<br>
call on moslems to rally round in a jihad against the crusaders. Now
<br>
Dubya has just stood up in front of a billion moslems and in effect
<br>
told them that Osama bin Laden is right; that this *is* a holy war
<br>
being waged by the christian nations against islam.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I have difficulty imagining a way he could have phrased it that would
<br>
have been more inflammatory or offensive to the islamic countries --
<br>
Pakistan, for example, but also all the Arab countries -- who he's trying
<br>
to drag into this coalition.  Here's a metaphor: imagine the response if
<br>
he'd announced his intention of sending troops to Somalia in terms like:
<br>
&quot;we're jes' goin' to pacify the niggers&quot;. _That_ is what pinning the
<br>
word &quot;crusade&quot; on America's response means to the islamic world.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
That's right, Dubya, you go on trying to build that coalition with Islamic
<br>
states as members. Don't you worry, they'll get the message. You've
<br>
probably just given bin Laden the first ray of hope since the 11th
<br>
of September.
