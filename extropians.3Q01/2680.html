Olga provided two links in reply to the links provided
<br>
by Al Villalobos.  The first of Olga's are
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;the journey to the Americas as made it, then the total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of victims of the Middle Passage climbs to between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20 and 30 million.&quot;
</em><br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.people.virginia.edu/~lrg4x/THEMIDDLEPASSAGE.html">http://www.people.virginia.edu/~lrg4x/THEMIDDLEPASSAGE.html</a>
<br>
<p>Note the word &quot;victims&quot;.  This figure is obtained by taking
<br>
the figures that are commonly agreed (from many sources),
<br>
namely 11-12 million, and *doubling* them to account for
<br>
all the ones who died during the voyage.  (I don't quite
<br>
understand this article---it says at one point that the
<br>
mortality rate was 10%-20% typically, but then implicitly
<br>
concludes that it was 50% later, when it says we should
<br>
double the number of arrivals in the Americas to obtain
<br>
the total that were taken from Africa towards the Americas.)
<br>
<p>The second URL that Olga provides,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;...The practice of slavery led to the deaths of at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 30 million people who died during transit in terrible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions on the slave ships. Many British businesses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and towns, such as Bristol, Liverpool and London,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prospered because of their involvement in the slave trade.&quot;

<br>
<p>does not look at all scholarly to me.  There is only this bland
<br>
assertion---that's it.

<p>Regarding the numbers of slaves dead on slave ships, my source was the book I mentioned
<br>
earlier by Randall Robinson (Harvard Law; founder and president of TransAmerica; he played
<br>
significant role in abolishing apartheid in South Africa - for whatever this is worth)
<br>
called The Debt.  I have done several Google searches myself, and have found many varying
<br>
numbers.  I don't know ... maybe we'll never know.  In any case, the &quot;gestalt&quot; of what I
<br>
wrote stands - whether 2 million slaves died en route, or 10 million, of more.  Below are
<br>
a couple of sites I found that hint at the &quot;millions&quot; dead on slave ships - I am more
<br>
interested in as close as we can get to the objective truth, in any case (and I feel this
<br>
way about everything).  The quotes below are taken from their respective links.  I'm done
<br>
with this subject, folks (I know I've said this before, but now I promise you - &quot;Yay! Yay!
<br>
Yay!&quot; ~ Peanut Gallery).  I thank you for your input.  Olga
<br>
<p>&quot;... It is extremely difficult to estimate the number of African that died during the
<br>
Middle Passage. Most historians do believe that nearly as many Africans died en route as
<br>
made it to the Americas. In the 1969 study, The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census, Philip
<br>
Curtin estimated the number of Africans transported across the ocean to have been 8
<br>
million. Most studies since then, however, have increased this number. In 1997, Hugh
<br>
Thomas’s The Slave Trade: The History of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440-1870 placed the
<br>
number of Africans that arrived in the Americas at 11 million. Other recent studies using
<br>
documented evidence have placed their estimates from 10-15 million. If it is to be assumed
<br>
that just as many Africans perished during the journey to the Americas as made it, then
<br>
the total number of victims of the Middle Passage climbs to between 20 and 30 million.&quot;
