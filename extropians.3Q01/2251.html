</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, miriam, BBT DOESN'T claim there was a central starting point.
<br>
Since the universe contains all points, at the moment of the monobloc,
<br>
all points were contained within it, there was nothing outside it, see?
<br>
I think that this is one of the big conceptual stumbling blocks that the
<br>
SST people can't seem to grasp.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you hear people talk about the big-bang theory you could be forgiven for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking that it is proven fact and not simply a theory. Even the microwave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; background radiation which is hailed as a great vidicator for big-bang was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a real problem for it in the early days. But theories get modified to fit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I kinda like the idea of old material getting squashed out of existence in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black holes and new material popping into existence in the great voids. Now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we know about vacuum energy (can't remember the proper term) it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't seem infeasible.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that zero point field energy can only be drawn out into
<br>
existence as matter in the presence of an event horizon. Without such a
<br>
boundary layer to separate particle pairs, the particle pairs cancel
<br>
each other out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have never understood the problem most people have with infinity. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems way more natural than a beginning or an end. As one who has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subscribed to an extropian way of thinking since early childhood the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prospect of a universe which never dies is infinitely more appealing.
</em><br>
<p>I have never understood why most people have a problem with the idea
<br>
that the end of the universe does not have to mean the end of
<br>
themselves. As one who has subscribed to an extropian way of thinking
<br>
isnce early childhood, the prospect of outliving the universe, and
<br>
experiencing infinite others, is infinitely more appealing. 
<br>
<p>There is, after all, a limit to how much you can know and experience in
<br>
this universe, and there is far greater possibility for experience in
<br>
traveling to other universes.
