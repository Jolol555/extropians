<p><em>&gt; My dear husband and I were recently talking, and something he said really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caught my attention.  He speculated that if past failures of statist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economies can often be attributed to mismanagement of faulty data, then with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the advent of advances such as artificial intelligence, comprehensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic data on both macro- and micro- levels, as well as more refined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modeling and forecasting techniques, there is no reason why centrally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlled economies may not turn out to be the more effective system,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after all, in the future.
</em><br>
<p>It's still very unlikely that centrally managed economies would *ever*
<br>
work as well as decentralized ones do.  I could never explain this as
<br>
well as Michael Friedman in &quot;The Machinery of Freedom&quot;, nor Thomas Sowell
<br>
in &quot;Knowledge and Decisions&quot;, nor of course, anything that Hayek wrote.
<br>
But thanks for the opportunity for me to describe in my own way how I
<br>
think one revealing instance works.
<br>
<p>There is no better or more familiar daily example of free-market 
<br>
cut-throat competition than supermarkets.  They want your business
<br>
so badly that they stop at almost nothing except physically man-handling
<br>
you into the stores from the parking lot.  They lower prices whenever
<br>
possible, and use ingenious jingles, advertisements, attractive
<br>
floor plans, proper lighting, and every other trick that the ingenuity
<br>
of humankind has come up with so far to get you to choose to patronize
<br>
their particular chain.
<br>
<p>Here is a funny anecdote.  A certain Russian spy had just defected to 
<br>
the West and was being interrogated in Washington D.C., but no one
<br>
was certain that he wasn't a double agent, and so the level of games
<br>
that he and his captors were playing was high.  At one point he needed
<br>
to be transported to another city, and so rode by car along with his
<br>
guards to the other locale.  On the way, they decided to stop and pick
<br>
up something at a supermarket, perhaps some snacks.  The agent was
<br>
led inside a typical supermarket, with goods piled high on all sides,
<br>
and everything done in as an attractive manner as could be thought of
<br>
after fifty years of cutthroat survival evolution.
<br>
<p>The Russian agent didn't believe that this could possibly be a typical
<br>
grocery store in America, and was even more convinced that his captors
<br>
were really going out of their way to play mind games with him.  Nothing
<br>
that they could say would convince him that the unbelievably elaborate
<br>
displays of food and other stocks were not specially arranged just for
<br>
him.
<br>
<p>Well, so what is the actual guiding principle behind the evolution of
<br>
the supermarket in the last fifty years?  My idea is that to a great
<br>
extent it's the doing of the store managers (or in the case of large
<br>
chains, perhaps some of the company psychologists).  But typically in
<br>
an American store---where there is freedom, and things have not yet
<br>
become too regulated---store managers lay awake at nights thinking
<br>
about how they can improve their facility, and how they can beat
<br>
the Safeway down the street.  Month in and month out, they study
<br>
their customers---their body language, their shopping patterns, and
<br>
most of all, their buying habits.  This immense concentration of
<br>
knowledge takes place in the minds of a few people who have an
<br>
enormous incentive to improve the quality of the stores.  The
<br>
immensity of this knowledge at present *cannot* be centralized.
<br>
(For just one reason why, the customers in Appalachia don't 
<br>
resemble the customers in Chicago at all, and even the customers
<br>
in Chicago's suburbs may not resemble each other if you travel
<br>
in some direction a couple of miles.)
<br>
<p>Of course, this is just one tiny aspect of capitalism, but I think
<br>
it is indicative of the power of freedom---because all of this fails
<br>
immediately if the customers aren't free to shop where they want,
<br>
or select any kinds of services they want (e.g., medicine).  Only
<br>
the free market, at present, has via Smith's invisible hand, the
<br>
true intelligence to do what is needed.  Stuffy bureaucrats hundreds
<br>
of miles away simply cannot compete.
<br>
<p>But your point is, of course, about the future.  What about the case
<br>
when AIs become so vast and so omniscient that they know all about
<br>
the clientele at Joe's liquor store, and can figure out (just like
<br>
Joe does) what will please his customers?  Well, I submit that by
<br>
that time, they'll be so smart that Joe will be completely unneeded.
<br>
Moreover, his customers will be unneeded too.
