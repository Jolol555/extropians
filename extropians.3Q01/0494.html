Harvey, Samantha, and Russell all report that poverty was never
<br>
a motivator for them.  That seems to be the usual explanation in
<br>
Silicon Valley, too.  I don't know about Spike, but poverty was
<br>
definitely my motivator.  With just a small guaranteed annual
<br>
income, I would have never abandoned playing chess, reading SF,
<br>
and carousing around with my friends discussing philosophy and
<br>
mathematics---which is mostly all I did in my twenties.  Spike
<br>
is right for at least some people when he writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How many of us would ever have bothered to learn programming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if not to advance our careers? ... Think of poverty as a drill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sergeant: in your face for sure, but he ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits you by teaching you to get with the program.
</em><br>
<p>We are all guilty, of course, of projecting our own motivations
<br>
and psychology onto too many others.  But it's pretty clear that
<br>
over the past several decades the hard work, creativity, and
<br>
economic contributions of a lot of people (even within something
<br>
as esoteric as computer programming) would have been lost without
<br>
the grim task master.  And this is probably true of even more
<br>
people than those willing to admit it.
<br>
<p>So I would suggest that *at the present time* a substantial
<br>
guaranteed income would have both serious economic consequences
<br>
and also deleterious psychological and educational consequences
<br>
for many people.
