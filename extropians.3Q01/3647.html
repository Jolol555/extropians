</em><br>
<p>Many years ago a friend persuaded me to join Mensa so I could go to the
<br>
monthly dinner meetings with him. Since I wasn't all that excited about
<br>
being a member, there's no way I would've spent time taking a special test,
<br>
but they accepted my GRE scores (The GRE is the graduate school equivalent
<br>
of the SAT).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why does society consider a person who can memorize words and

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think most people would agree with you, Natasha, that common sense is as
<br>
important as IQ. The two kinds of intelligence aren't mutually exclusive,
<br>
though. I haven't followed the discussion about Mensa on Cryonet, but the
<br>
people I met at the Mensa dinner meetings seemed quite ordinary; some seemed
<br>
to be well endowed with common sense and others didn't, as with any other
<br>
gathering of people.
<br>
<p>I agree with Eliezer that you don't see anything interesting until you go a
<br>
lot farther out on the scale, at least to the top .00001 per centile. I
<br>
haven't noticed that people at this level are less likely to possess common
<br>
sense than people lower down the scale, but I think they do tend to find it
<br>
difficult to socialize with &quot;normal&quot; people and thus might come across as
<br>
weird or deficient in common sense and social skills. This is due in part, I
<br>
think, to different interests. Even where there's a common topic of
<br>
interest, the high-IQ person will likely be interested in the topic at a
<br>
different level.
