<p>&lt;&lt; Once again, you show your true colors, Joe. Demonizing, again, your
<br>
&nbsp;opponents. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Wait long enough and everyone gets &quot;demonized.&quot;  Look at how Fox News and 
<br>
Russ Limbaugh (both run by Westwood Communications) is the Democratic Party 
<br>
lashers par excellance'.  On the other hand, we have had the Liberal Social 
<br>
agenda and the Political Agenda pimped on national TV for maybe 35 years.
<br>
<p>The problem is that so many issues are so complicated, that it would take a 
<br>
reasonable assessment by a commission of scholars whose goal was accuarate 
<br>
analysis of each and every issue. The trick, of course, is to make sure such 
<br>
commissions are as honest as possible. This may never happen because the News 
<br>
orgs pimp to Joe Six pack who doesn't give a shit about what is going on, or 
<br>
likes to see bad news, simply because they can say to themselves: &quot;Duh! I'm 
<br>
glad it ain't happend to me! Burp! &quot;  Call it the marching moron factor, and 
<br>
believe me, I ain't such a sharp tool either.
