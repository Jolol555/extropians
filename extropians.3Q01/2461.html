<em>&gt; &gt; My own view of the ultimate ends of the universe and the fate of

</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; If this is technologically feasible, why wouldn't we do it thirty physical

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Because time and therefore processing and therefore certainly
<br>
learning will not proceed instantaneously immediately upon
<br>
Singularity occurring.  Processing power can only be grown at
<br>
physically possible speeds.  Using that capacity fully and well
<br>
proceeds even more slowly.  Learning I expect proceeds more
<br>
slowly still.  I think it is a mistake to assume that all that
<br>
is knowable will be known almost immediately after reaching
<br>
Singularity.
<br>
<p>There is a cartoon from the series that I think was called &quot;Bob
<br>
the Angry Flower&quot; that shows instead an angry Galaxy Brain.  In
<br>
the cartoon the galaxy sized mind is complaining to others of
<br>
its kind that it has computed all possible things and finished
<br>
so many picoseconds ago and now there is nothing more to do
<br>
forever!  A small cluster brain responds, &quot;I told you not to
<br>
compute It all at once.  I told you you would be sorry!&quot;  :-)
<br>
<p><p>I don't think arriving at the point I spoke of is the Grand
<br>
Finale at all.  I don't think there is a &quot;Grand Finale&quot;;
<br>
especially if it is possible to transcend this space/time
<br>
continuum and its limitations completely.
