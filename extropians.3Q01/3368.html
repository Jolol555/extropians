To my mind the central truth of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is easily 
<br>
demonstrated.  Certain computer languages make certain kinds of program 
<br>
easy to write, and other kinds of program quite difficult.  Even while 
<br>
all of these languages are formally complete.
<br>
<p>The projects that one would tackle in ML are not the same as the ones 
<br>
that one would tackle in Fortran.  Or C.  Or C++.  Or Ada.  Or 
<br>
Smalltalk.  These are all different.  There is no technical reason why 
<br>
any particular project could not be done in any of them (e.g., most of 
<br>
them and be made to emit C code, or can use C as one step of their 
<br>
compilation process).  But the difficulty of a project can vary 
<br>
radically from language to language.  And the variation is 
<br>
systematically different for different kinds of project.
<br>
<p>So the hypothesis is testably true (and perhaps it should now be called 
<br>
a theory).  Assessing the degree to which (and areas on which) different 
<br>
human languages have this effect is, however, much more difficult.
