<em>&gt; Samantha, you are quite brilliant.  But a number of times you have

<p>I can see how you might get that.  But the rest of the post in
<br>
question does tell about how schools as they have been (public
<br>
anyway) tend to dumb down everyone, brilliant or not, as a
<br>
matter of policy.  
<br>
<p>On being &quot;brilliant&quot;, I think it is either something more people
<br>
can be trained to or that we will quite soon know how to make
<br>
everyone just as brilliant in terms of general intelligence
<br>
(whatever exactly that turns out to be) as could be wished.  Of
<br>
course, having them freely choose to get brighter is another
<br>
quesiton entirely.
