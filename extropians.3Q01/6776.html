</em><br>
<p>I, myself, have been disturbed at how often people try to link racism,
<br>
isolationism, initiation of force, sacrifice of innocents, benevolent
<br>
dictatorship, censorship, shutdown of unpopular ideas, and the like with the
<br>
Extropian Principals.  A lot of people seem to support freedom, but only for
<br>
their own ideas, not for someone else's ideas.
<br>
<p>Some recent postings seem to suggest that we should sacrifice innocents to
<br>
speed up the development of technology in the name of The Extropian
<br>
Principals.  I do not think these ideas derive from the principals at all.
<br>
Other postings have suggested that the principals are fine for academic
<br>
discussion, but we are at war and the principals no longer apply.  If this
<br>
is true, we need to adjust the principals.  Principals are statements of
<br>
truth for all time.  They cannot just be discarded when they become
<br>
inconvenient.
<br>
<p>This may be a good time to re-examine the principals and to clarify them.
<br>
Perhaps we can prioritize the principals, or place them in order of
<br>
preference.  Perhaps we can put more into the FAQ addressing some of these
<br>
presumptions, specifically stating that certain positions are not compatible
<br>
with the Extropian Principals.
