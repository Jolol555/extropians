Jeff, I suspect that there would be a lot of infection with the &quot;minor&quot; virus
<br>
such as EBV, CMV etc that on a large scale would not be good. Also major
<br>
virus or other disease vectors (BSV,HIV and who knows what else)could be spread.
<br>
There is enough problems with whole blood products as it is.
<br>
<p>One question I had was how long the immunity lasts. If you were vaccinated
<br>
as an 
<br>
infant and then re-vaccinated as a young adult and the second did not take
<br>
(no second scar) does that mean you had adequate protection from smallpox at
<br>
the time of the second vaccination? And does that provide any indication of
<br>
protection as an adult?
<br>
<p>Best Wishes
<br>
<p>Ralph
