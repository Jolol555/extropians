<p>I knew you'd say that.  I also stated reason and purpose were important to
<br>
me - so, obviously, I have found no reason and purpose to switch &quot;today.&quot;
<br>
Also, I'm not attracted to mean spiritedness.  And I find it useless to
<br>
argue about things I am not defending, like &quot;reparations&quot; in the way it's
<br>
been bandied about, like a joke.  Reparations is not about &quot;give me the
<br>
money.&quot;  The few reasonable posts about it were not addressed (and, here,
<br>
I'm not talking about anything I posted about this subject).  I personally
<br>
am not interested in discussing this any more, with people who claim to be
<br>
reasonable - but drown out any kernel of an idea with ridicule and hyperbole
<br>
and helpful suggestions to me about getting out and seeing the rest of the
<br>
world (actually, I've already had that privilege).

<br>
<p>Maybe for leftist-liberals there is no [or, not as much] &quot;there&quot; there to go
<br>
to (hail, Gertrude Stein).  While I applaud that you have made journeys out
<br>
of your comfort zone, it is arrogant for you to suppose that &quot;we&quot; [commie
<br>
pinko socialist statist leftists that we are] have not examined issues out
<br>
of our &quot;comfort zone.&quot;  I certainly have, and if I haven't switched my
<br>
position &quot;today,&quot; it is because I've found most issues from the libertarian
<br>
position ... wanting.  Libertarians oppose the minimum wage, for instance.
<br>
Get serious!  Minimum wage causes unemployment.  Get serious!  Give me some
<br>
good place to &quot;go&quot; to ... and then maybe I will.
<br>
<p>C'mon, libertarians don't have a monopoly on &quot;sweet reason.&quot;
