</em><br>
<p>You surprise me here. I was talking about the British situation primarily, where
<br>
nowadays it is pretty 
<br>
much as you describe. However in the past very strict and detailed controls
<br>
&nbsp;were enforced by 
<br>
covenants, often highly effectively. Did this not happen in North America? (I'm
<br>
a complete ignoramus 
<br>
about the history of planning law etc in that part of the world). There wasn't
<br>
a &quot;third party&quot; to enforce 
<br>
building codes here until 1909 or even 1948  (unless you count the original
<br>
landlord such as the 
<br>
Grosvenor or Russell Estate as playing that role - a possible benefit of feudal
<br>
survivals perhaps). The 
<br>
courts did allow third party action to deal with &quot;neighbourhood effects&quot; under
<br>
the common law ground 
<br>
of nuisance but this is now more difficult than it used to be. Of course there
<br>
is the big question of the 
<br>
trade-off between safety/quality and cost and how to strike the balance but
<br>
that's another story as 
<br>
they say. Steve Davies 
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As for fire safety measures, they do mandate the most obvious and long
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accepted measures: mandating smoke alarms, fire extinguishers, and clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fire lanes for evacuation, though most do so only due to the threat of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fines to themselves from quarterly or annual fire inspections if their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;community has them. Note the money thing there....
