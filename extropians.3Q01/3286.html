</em><br>
<p>It doesn't.  There is a whole history of research into biological factors of
<br>
human behavior, particularly hormones, and particularly estrogen and
<br>
testosterone.  Commonly held beliefs about testosterone and estrogen are
<br>
mostly false stereotypes.  Crime studies have not found any relationship
<br>
between testosterone and crime.  I think people here are assuming that most
<br>
men have more testosterone than most women, and that women in prison are
<br>
more masculine than most women.  These stereotypes are not true.
<br>
Testosterone might be a factor in anger or aggression, but most crimes are
<br>
not sudden crimes of passion.  Most crimes are drug-related in the US, or
<br>
money-related otherwise.  Even serial killers or rapists are usually not
<br>
spur-of-the-moment acts that happen out of a burst of uncontrolled emotion.
<br>
<p>The closest biological factor that has been linked with possible criminal
<br>
behavior is the presence of an extra Y chromosome.  Although this is the
<br>
male sex chromosome, and most people assumed that those who possess it would
<br>
be more masculine, this does not turn out to be the case.  Such men are
<br>
usually tall and skinny, possibly slightly higher intelligence, but often
<br>
disturbed.  They do not have increased testosterone, but have increased
<br>
mental problems and anti-social problems that contribute to crime.  Most of
<br>
these studies have been discredited due to poor statistical methods.  The
<br>
assumptions about testosterone or masculine-linked crime genes have since
<br>
been discarded.
<br>
<p>Other studies in testosterone in men and in women do not detect any relation
<br>
to testosterone and intelligence, achievement, social standing, etc.  While
<br>
there are social difference between men and women, studying testosterone
<br>
alone does not explain the differences.  Men with more testosterone are not
<br>
more likely to succeed, be intelligent, advance farther in business or
<br>
academics.  The same is true for women.  Testosterone regulates a lot of
<br>
biological functions in the body, but it does not have much to do with
<br>
mental processes or social behavior.  Even in sexual activity and behavior,
<br>
testosterone has not been found to have any affect.  Many studies on
<br>
straight and gay men have found no correlation between testosterone or
<br>
estrogen levels and sexual orientation, submissiveness/aggressiveness, or
<br>
sexual prowess.  Testosterone does not seem to even have much effect on
<br>
people's sex lives as most people think it would.
<br>
<p>This information comes from my memory of my college days when I minored in
<br>
Biology and Psychology.
