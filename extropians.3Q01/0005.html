<em>&gt; &gt; I disagree that it is a deathist movie. The big tragedy is that the

<em>&gt; &gt; android gets his meaning of life from loving somebody. He lives only for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; his love, making him fundamentally unable to be an independent being. He

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; belongs to the cynical gigolo androids :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Altho disappointing in many ways, A.I. has some redeeming qualities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I kinda see why Eliezer kinda liked it: in the end, when the humans were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone and everything was a machine, it was, well... OK.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was OK without the orgas.  It helps us see that we *are* machines,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mechas are machines, we are real, they are real.  We are machines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with some fascinating flaws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regarding cynical gigolo androids, if such a thing ever came to pass,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you know we nerds would be trying to pass ourselves off as machines,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by learning that head trick.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, that final scene was well done methinks, because of the mechas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking down thru that window creating the impression of ambiguity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between real and simulation.  Spielberg slightly defocussed the camera
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at Davids homecoming to emphasize that you really dont know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if this is the atom world or electron world.  I got the impression that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; David was in a sim for the last few minutes of the film.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Question: if all the ice on earth melted, how much would the seas rise?
</em><br>
<p>Allegedly 200 meters, 2 of which would be absorbed by the Caspian Sea
<br>
and other areas below sea level that are not filled with water
<br>
currently. This would require a temperature increase at a minimum of 15
<br>
degrees (since my cousin found that the Antarctic has been stable for
<br>
the last 22 million years, and that is the hottest temperature in that
<br>
period)
