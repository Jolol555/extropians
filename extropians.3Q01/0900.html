<p>We might try and open-source the development of tools, if they're tools
<br>
that can be useful to others.  In fact, that's currently the plan with
<br>
respect to at least one of the tools we might need.  But the AI itself
<br>
doesn't seem like the kind of thing that could be open-sourced.  I used to
<br>
plan that way, but later learned, on reading my Eric S. Raymond, that open
<br>
source is especially well suited to certain types of projects, and
<br>
generally intelligent AI is not one of them.  Characteristics that make AI
<br>
wrong for open-source include:  (1) Open-source works best when the
<br>
creation to be implemented is well-understood (Linux was not the first
<br>
Unix implementation); (2) Open-source is very hard to get started unless
<br>
there is running code that does something cool, and there may be a heckuva
<br>
lot of coding required before a true general intelligence can say &quot;Hello
<br>
world&quot; much less do cool stuff; (3) Open-source works best when code can
<br>
be developed by a loosely distributed team working in rough but not
<br>
perfect synchronization; an AI, *especially* in the initial phases, would
<br>
probably need to be developed by a very tightly knit team.
