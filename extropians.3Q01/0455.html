<em>&gt; &gt; While some may take peruile pleasure at seeing themselves as such,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Being a socialist has nothing to do with whether you consider yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a cyborg.  You seem to have gotten confused by the Star Trek name &quot;Borg&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and think that cyborgs are collective entities.  Instead, cyborgs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are cybernetic organisms, that is, organisms which have cybernetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhancements or implants.  It has nothing to do with socialism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cyborgs could be of any political party whatsoever.
</em><br>
<p>Yes they could, and I did not confuse the names. The Borg is a
<br>
collective mind of cyborg drones. The problem with the term cyborg is
<br>
that it is forever associated with a zombie-like, less than human
<br>
condition, arising from idealization of the unaltered, uninjured human
<br>
form: Robocop may be strong and smart and a good shot, but he is cripped
<br>
emotionally by the corporation programming and editing of his memories.
<br>
<p>Delightedly using the word as a self referent automatically triggers
<br>
emotional and preexisting reflexes in people's minds from cheap B movies
<br>
and bad TV scifi. Its just a bad move in the war of semantics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously today the opportunities for cybernetic enhancement are limited.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I took the thrust of Helen's question to be a matter of self-definition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some people may think of themselves as cyborgs, or proto-cyborgs, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they choose to take advantage of whatever cybernetic opportunities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are available.  To the maximum degree possible, they simulate the effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of having cybernetic implants.  Perhaps they carry a wireless Internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access device and/or wear a heads-up display.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some of these people may define themselves as cyborgs in order to direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and focus their thoughts towards future enhancements.  To some extent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are what you define yourself to be, what you choose to be.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these people that Helen is hoping to contact.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I understand her intent completely. However, I stand by my position
<br>
that to embrace the word cyborg as a self referent is to embrace
<br>
mundanes prejudices as accurate reflections of a transhumanists point of
<br>
view.
