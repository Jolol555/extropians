Mike and Samantha write that $10,000 would tempt very few
<br>
people to give up their jobs and retire.  (I did stipulate
<br>
somewhere that this was not to interfere with any other
<br>
benefits that the people are currently receiving.)
<br>
<p>Mike:
<br>
<p>&quot;With a GI of $10,000, it's enough to live in a crappy
<br>
little studio apartment, no kids, no pets, and no fun.&quot;
<br>
<p>What?  You must be thinking of a single adult in a high or
<br>
average price area.  Lots of people are already *retired*
<br>
on about that from the government (my mother is one).  Three
<br>
or four friends going together can live modestly, but adequately
<br>
on their $30K or $40K.
<br>
<p>Samantha:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Much too pessimisstic.  At least until recently you could get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the equivalent of that on welfare in the US (though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admittedly with a lot of hassle).  You sure didn't see any large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of people in a hurry to quit their jobs and live on such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an amount.  So why believe they would if you simply removed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; red tape?
</em><br>
<p>(a) the certainty and reliability of it (b) not having to prove
<br>
to anyone that you need it (c) the lack of self-consciousness
<br>
or guilt that sometimes affects people when they know that if
<br>
they only tried a lot harder they could get a job (no reflection
<br>
on them---I know that if I tried harder I could get a higher
<br>
paying job).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you hate what you do for a living enough to be tempted?
</em><br>
<p>Right now I have a very cushy job (I know what nail to hit
<br>
and am very well paid for it).  But it's not intellectually
<br>
stimulating (at least not compared to my private interests).
<br>
Yeah, sometimes I hate it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you think many people really do?  When only 25% of even major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lottery winners decide to not seek any gainful work why on earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would you think a whopping 25% would do it for something on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order of $10000/yr?
</em><br>
<p>Eight hundred dollars a month is a lot to many people.  Millions
<br>
of people, especially younger people, ALREADY live with little
<br>
visible means of support.  Take it from me, as one of those who
<br>
is not madly in love with how they earn their bread, and who at
<br>
age 30 didn't have a career---for those people who've never been
<br>
employed especially, preparing yourself mentally to change your
<br>
habits and punctually show up somewhere to work eight hours a day
<br>
is not easy.  Staggering numbers of people under 30 would simply
<br>
never enter the work force if they could just get $800 a month
<br>
for doing nothing.
<br>
<p>As for those who already have jobs, I'll defer to what the majority
<br>
here apparently intuits:  namely that only a small percentage (say
<br>
around 10 per cent?) would give up their jobs during the next five
<br>
years.
<br>
