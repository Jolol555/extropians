</em><br>
<p>This has been debunked, to a large degree.  I recall in 1969 doing a term
<br>
paper on Piaget and wondering, absently, if he was sure that the children
<br>
knew what he was talking about when he used the words &quot;more&quot; and &quot;less&quot;.
<br>
Finally someone much later repeated the experiments and, well, here is how
<br>
Keith Devlin tells it: (there is a similar, but not so graphic, account in
<br>
&quot;The Number Sense&quot; by Stanislas Dehaene)
<br>
<p>The Math Gene  pp. 27-31 &quot;The Rise and Fall of Piaget&quot;, by Keith Devlin
<br>
<p>Much of our current popular wisdom about small children's mental abilities originates in
<br>
the
<br>
work of the cognitive psychologist Jean Piaget fifty years ago.  Piaget's influence can be
<br>
found not only in many of our current beliefs about the way children learn, but also in
<br>
our
<br>
educational systems.  Unfortunately, as often happens with ground-braking research,
<br>
subsequent
<br>
investigations have show that many of Piaget's conclusions were almost certainly wrong. (I
<br>
say
<br>
&quot;almost certainly&quot; because some psychologists still maintain that Piaget was right, and
<br>
that
<br>
the experimental results I shall describe admit alternative conclusions.)
<br>
<p>In the 1940s and I950s, Piaget developed a &quot;constructivist&quot; view of child development.
<br>
According to this view, a newborn baby enters the world with a cognitive clean slate and,
<br>
by
<br>
observing the world around it, gradually pieces together a coherent and steadily
<br>
increasing
<br>
understanding of that world. In other words, the child constructs a mental model or
<br>
conceptualization of the world.
<br>
<p>Piaget did not arrive at his conclusions by armchair speculation. He was an
<br>
experimentalist,
<br>
and his experiments are one reason why his work was so influential.. It took great
<br>
ingenuity
<br>
and equipment not available in Piaget's time for subsequent generations to devise more
<br>
reliable
<br>
experiments. When they did so, they reached very different conclusions.
<br>
<p>For example, according to Piaget, children younger than ten months old have no proper
<br>
sense of
<br>
physical objects as things that endure in the world. Piaget based this conclusion on his
<br>
observation that, when an object such as a toy is hidden under a cloth, a baby ten months
<br>
old
<br>
or younger will fail to reach for it. According to Piaget, &quot;object permanency,&quot; as he
<br>
called
<br>
it, is not innate but is acquired sometime after ten months of age.
<br>
<p>Similarly, Piaget believed that children do not have a number sense until they acquire it
<br>
at
<br>
around four or five years of age. In one of Piaget's experiments, repeated many times by
<br>
different groups, a psychologist would show a four-year-old child two equally spaced rows
<br>
of
<br>
six glasses and six bottles and ask whether there were more glasses or more bottles. The
<br>
child
<br>
invariably answered that there were the same number. Presumably the child observed a
<br>
one-to-one
<br>
correspondence between the rows. The experimenter then spread out the glasses to form a
<br>
longer row and asked the child again whether there were more glasses or more bottles. Now
<br>
the child would answer that there were more glasses, apparently misled by the longer
<br>
length
<br>
of that row. &quot;Obviously,&quot; Piaget concluded, &quot;this shows that the child does not have a
<br>
properly developed number sense.&quot; In particular, Piaget claimed, four- and five-year-old
<br>
children have not yet grasped the idea of number conservation: the notion that rearranging
<br>
the
<br>
objects in a collection does not change their number.
<br>
<p>At the time, Piaget's experiments were held up as triumphs of experimental science in
<br>
psychology. As a pioneer, Piaget was blazing a trail for future generations. And that is
<br>
good
<br>
science. Unfortunately, his methods had serious flaws. He relied on the motor actions of
<br>
the
<br>
babies in the object permanency test and on a dialogue between the experimenter and the
<br>
subject
<br>
for the various number tests performed on older children.
<br>
<p>In the case of object permanency, a baby's failure to reach for an object hidden under a
<br>
blanket does not support the rather dramatic conclusion that the baby thinks the object
<br>
has
<br>
ceased to exist. Perhaps he simply does not yet have sufficient hand-arm coordination to
<br>
reach
<br>
for a hidden object. In fact, we now know that this explanation is correct. Recent
<br>
experiments,
<br>
more sophisticated than Piaget's, indicate that even very young babies have a
<br>
well-developed
<br>
sense of object permanency.
<br>
<p>Likewise, dialogue with a small child is highly unreliable. Communication via language is
<br>
never
<br>
100 percent objective and free of the influences of context, emotion, social factors, and
<br>
possibly several other things. Just how unreliable dialogue can be was demonstrated by
<br>
Jacques
<br>
Mehler and Tom Bever at MIT during the late 1960s.
<br>
<p>In one experiment, Mehler and Bever carried out the original Piaget experiment to test for
<br>
number conservation, but with two- and three-year old children instead of Piaget's four-
<br>
and
<br>
five-year-olds. The children succeeded perfectly. Consequently, unless we believe that
<br>
children
<br>
temporarily lose their sense of number conservation between the ages of four and six, we
<br>
clearly need some alternative explanation for Piaget's results. One is readily available.
<br>
<p>Around five years of age, children begin to develop the ability to reason about another
<br>
person's thought process (&quot;What Daddy means by this is . . . &quot;). This provides the most
<br>
likely
<br>
explanation of Piaget's observations. Remember the way the experiment was performed. First
<br>
the
<br>
experimenter arranges the glasses and bottles in two equally spaced rows and asks the
<br>
child
<br>
which row has more objects. Then the experimenter rearranges one of the rows, making it
<br>
longer,
<br>
and again asks the child, &quot;Which row has more objects?&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, by four or five years of age, a young child knows that adults are powerful and are
<br>
knowledgeable. Moreover, she has probably observed the respect her parent showed the
<br>
experimenter when they arrived at the laboratory. How is this child likely to react when
<br>
she
<br>
sees the experimenter rearrange the objects in one of the two rows and then ask the very
<br>
same
<br>
question as a moment earlier, &quot;Which row has more objects?&quot; She may well reason, &quot;Hmm.
<br>
That's
<br>
the same question she just asked me. Adults are not dumb, and this is a special kind of
<br>
adult
<br>
who knows a lot. We can both see that the number of objects hasn't changed. So I must have
<br>
misunderstood the question the last time. I thought she was asking me about the number of
<br>
objects in the row, but obviously she was really asking me about the length, since that's
<br>
what
<br>
she just changed.&quot; And so the child gives the answer she thinks is expected of her.
<br>
<p>Of course, we can't know for sure. Attempts to find out by interrogating the child are
<br>
unlikely
<br>
to yield conclusive evidence, for the same reason that the original Piaget experiment is
<br>
suspect! This is where the Mehler and Bever experiment came into its own. The kind of
<br>
&quot;what-does-she-really-want?&quot; reasoning just described is beyond two- or three-year olds.
<br>
Mehler
<br>
and Bever's younger subjects took the experimenters' questions literally, and counted
<br>
correctly.
<br>
<p>What Piaget's original experiment really showed is that four- and five year-old children
<br>
can
<br>
reason rationally about the motivations and expectations of another person. That's an
<br>
important
<br>
and useful discovery. But it's not the one Piaget thought he had made!
<br>
<p>To confirm that children from age two upward have a good sense of number, Mehler and Bever
<br>
redesigned the Piaget test to avoid the reliance on language. Their idea was
<br>
breathtakingly
<br>
simple. Instead of glasses and bottles they presented the child with two rows of M&amp;Ms. One
<br>
row
<br>
contained six M&amp;Ms, the other had four. Sometimes the rows were the same length; sometimes
<br>
the
<br>
row of six M&amp;Ms was longer; other times the row of four M&amp;Ms was longer. Instead of being
<br>
asked
<br>
to indicate which row had more candies, the child was simply told he could pick one row
<br>
and eat
<br>
them. The outcome was precisely what any parent would predict. The child invariably
<br>
plumped for
<br>
the row of six candies, regardless of its length. He knew full well which row had more
<br>
members,
<br>
and moreover realized that the number was not dependent on the arrangement. The result was
<br>
just
<br>
as conclusive with two-year-old children as with four year-olds.
<br>
<p>Another ingenious variation of the original Piaget experiment reached the same conclusion.
<br>
This
<br>
time, James McGarrigle and Margaret Donaldson of the University of Edinburgh carried out
<br>
their
<br>
experiment in a small puppet theater. Like Piaget, they started by aligning two rows of
<br>
the
<br>
same number of objects and asking the child which row had more objects. After the child
<br>
responded correctly, the experimenter pretended to look away while a teddy bear puppet
<br>
lengthened one of the rows. Turning back, the experimenter exclaimed, &quot;Oh dear, that silly
<br>
teddy has mixed up the rows. can you tell me which row has more objects again?&quot; Children
<br>
from
<br>
two to five invariably gave the correct answer. Since the teddy bear had rearranged one of
<br>
the
<br>
rows, unseen by the experimenter, the child presumably found it reasonable for the adult
<br>
to ask
<br>
the same question again. Yet when the experimenter repeated the process with the same
<br>
children
<br>
but rearranged the objects him- or herself, the four- and five-year-old children responded
<br>
exactly as they had for Piaget, basing their answer on length.
