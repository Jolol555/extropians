<em>&gt; The progress in dealing with the environment is encouraging and welcome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; news.  But those of us who favor individual rights must face the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this progress was generally achieved only through coercion.  People did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not clean the water and air, and begin protecting endangered species,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through voluntary actions.  The gains were made only by passing laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forbidding pollution and harming endangered animals.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not going to disagree that it was government action, only that it
<br>
was the sort of action that libertarians (or at least the minarchists,
<br>
among whom I sometimes include myself) should be willing to support.  
<br>
<p>Sometimes these laws achieved their effects by outright prohibition, but
<br>
the more effective of them were designed to reduce the impact of
<br>
externalities on third parties.  As such, they are supposed to make the
<br>
choices that individuals make take more account of the costs than if the
<br>
effects of pollution are passed on to society as a whole to take care of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Success in achieving protection goals doesn't mean that we can eliminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the laws that have brought those goals about.  When we support and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; celebrate this positive progress, we are supporting the laws which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brought us here, laws which infringe on individual freedom.
</em><br>
<p>If you read Julian Simon's &quot;The Ultimate Resource 2&quot;, you'll see lots of
<br>
arguments that many of these changes would likely have come about
<br>
without infringing on anyone's freedom.  One of Simon's arguments is
<br>
that as societies get richer, industry develops technologies that use
<br>
ever more of the inputs effectively, and that side effects are mitigated
<br>
because companies find it more cost effective to reuse and recycle. 
<br>
Another driver is that the public wants a cleaner environment for lots
<br>
of reasons, and finds ways to encourage their neighbors to not mess up
<br>
the neighborhood.
