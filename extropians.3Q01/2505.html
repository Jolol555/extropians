Wow, in an interesting mis-application of the &quot;intelligence&quot; of
<br>
the net the original message, attached below, got truncated
<br>
when inserted (even as &quot;source&quot;!) into the Javien database.
<br>
(No fingers being pointed here -- it could be a problem on my end.)
<br>
I don't know if the list subscribers got the truncated version
<br>
or not but I'm throwing it into the thread again (as well
<br>
as personal mailboxes) to make sure I'm not being misinterpreted.
<br>
<p>As a followup to Brian's comment regarding what Samantha was
<br>
pointing out -- I may have failed to follow the thread back
<br>
far enough to have understood the details in full.  If it is
<br>
true that post-singularity intelligences can significantly
<br>
rewrite the laws of physics as we now know them, then all bets
<br>
are clearly off.  However, I personally wish people wouldn't be so
<br>
willing to take the universe as we know it and think it is
<br>
something that can so easily be discarded.  I'd sooner
<br>
vote that its all a simulation (which can of course be
<br>
transcended if the simulation manager decides to resurrect
<br>
us in the &quot;real&quot; universe).  And nothing we &quot;know&quot; about this
<br>
universe need be any reflection of what the real universe
<br>
may be like if that is the case.

<p>Tsk, tsk, tsk, you folks need to read the literature...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Drexler, 1995 (emphasis mine):
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;The shortcomings of current fabrication processes, when considered from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the perspective of *ultimate* limits, are dramatic. The number of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinct covalent three-dimensional, highly polycyclic structures (here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; termed `diamondoid') that can occupy a volume of one **cubic nanometer**
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been estimated to be greater than 10^148 (Drexler 1992). This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volume can contain more than 100 atoms, each chosen from one of many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elements, and even a pure-carbon structure with exactly 100 atoms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could exist in many stable bonding patterns.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most of these structures are irregular and asymmetrical, and hence cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be made by techniques that produce crystals. Since 10^148 is **greater**
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the number of particles in the observable universe, random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generation processes would be ineffective. to say nothing of inefficient.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>If there is anything to be &quot;known&quot; about all the capabilities of
<br>
all the possible nanomachinery that you can assemble in a cubic nanometer
<br>
then I don't think you are going to know it even &quot;thirty physical
<br>
seconds&quot; after the Singularity (as Eliezer qualified).
<br>
<p>One thing I'm pretty clear of is that *if* we want to come even
<br>
close to exploring that phase space, then sub-atomic computing
<br>
*is* likely to be necessary.  If so, you have now crossed the
<br>
boundary into the realm of &quot;magic physics&quot;.
<br>
<p>Samantha is right in that &quot;optimizing&quot; the computronium takes
<br>
a very long time because of the requirements for moving materials
<br>
around the solar system, breeding the right element mix for all
<br>
the nanomachinery, etc.  Those things are going to take time even
<br>
when you have stars to burn.
