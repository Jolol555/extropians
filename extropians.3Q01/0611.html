Anybody who can prove &quot;spiritual healing&quot; by something as simple as a
<br>
research design with two comparison groups, will get James Randi's
<br>
$1,000,000 prize for &quot;The Psychic Challenge&quot;. I have corresponded with JR
<br>
on this matter and it seems such religionists have been well apprised of
<br>
the opportunity. Given that they don't take advantage of it, that is
<br>
enough in my mind, to prove fraud on the part of all those
<br>
tele-evangelical hucksters for whom so-called spiritual healing is
<br>
stock-in-trade.

<p><em>&gt; Some interesting tidbits from sunday's Washington Post outlook article

<em>&gt; 'Calling Dr God'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Researchers have found, for example, that religious people live, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average, about seven years longer than other Americans. Levin cites a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; study done by California's respected Human Population Laboratory that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tracked 5,000 people for 28 years and found that those who  frequently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attended church were 23 percent less likely to die during the study
</em><br>
<em>&gt; period than people who didn't regularly go to church. &quot;This holds true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even controlling for the fact that religious folks tend to avoid such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors as smoking and drinking that increase the risk of disease and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death,&quot; Levin reported.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other studies have found that for each of the three leading causes of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death in the United States -- heart disease, cancer and hypertension --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who report a religious affiliation have lower rates of illness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have reported that attending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious services at least once a month more than halved the risk of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death due to heart disease, emphysema, suicide and some kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cancers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, consider this: A 1988 study by San Francisco cardiologist Randolph
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Byrd in the Southern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Medical Journal reported that coronary care patients who, unknown to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, were prayed for by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strangers in Christian prayer groups outside the hospital fared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly better than patients who did not receive prayers -- a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding confirmed by another research team 10 years later and currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the subject of a large-scale study at Harvard Medical School. (*)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More generally, Levin says, a deeply held religious faith seems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly effective in warding off death among people who are already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ill or infirm and wish to return to good health. For example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researchers at Dartmouth Medical School examined the survival rates of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 232 post-surgical cardiac patients. &quot;Deaths in a six-month follow-up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; period after open-heart surgery were 11 percent in patients who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered themselves 'not at all,' 'slightly' or 'fairly' religious,' &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levin reported. &quot;In those who were 'deeply' religious, the death rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was zero&quot; -- findings similar to those from a study of 400 older adults
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Connecticut conducted by researchers at Harvard and Yale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universities.
