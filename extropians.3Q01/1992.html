Eliezer
<br>
<p>quoted...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I wish there was a good synonym for 'transhumanism' that did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sound quite so new-agey.  Does anyone know of any? Mark.
</em><br>
<p>... then commented:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Useful phrases:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Pro-technology movement&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Ultratechnology&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Future shock&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Extreme technology&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Exponential increase&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Asymptotic increase&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Intelligence enhancement&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Technological production of greater-than-human intelligence&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Recursively self-improving Artificial Intelligence&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Some of these phrases are useful in various contexts. Some of them are 
<br>
precise and are simply the *right* jargon for what they refer to, eg the 
<br>
last one. But others are more off-putting, I'd suggest, than 
<br>
&quot;transhumanism&quot;. For example, a lot of people would get a very negative 
<br>
connotation from &quot;ultratechnology&quot;.
<br>
<p>Mark etc could probably have got away with &quot;Future Studies&quot; for their 
<br>
journal even though &quot;X Studies&quot; always sounds a bit like an academic wank. 
<br>
Furthermore, the field already exists and a lot of people in that field 
<br>
would be opposed to transhumanist ideas. To use the title honestly would 
<br>
mean running a journal open to their viewpoints. Moreover, I believe there 
<br>
are already journals with similar titles (I mean to look into these, because 
<br>
we probably should all be thinking about publication there to ensure that 
<br>
they are not just another set of forums for neo-Luddite consensus).
<br>
<p>In most contexts, it is not necessary to identify yourself as &quot;a 
<br>
transhumanist&quot; or &quot;an extropian&quot; or whatever. I get by a lot of the time 
<br>
just talking about how I want to discuss &quot;postulated technologies&quot; or &quot;the 
<br>
implications of postulated technologies&quot; or &quot;the issue of resistance to 
<br>
postulated technologies&quot; and giving a few examples of what I mean: nanotech, 
<br>
high-level AI, full-immersion VR, radical life extension.
<br>
<p>All that said, &quot;transhumanism&quot; and its cognates are useful if you must put a 
<br>
label on yourself or on a body of ideas about the future. Moreover, it at 
<br>
least sounds like an obvious name for a philosophical position. After all, 
<br>
we already have both &quot;humanism&quot; and &quot;anti-humanism&quot;. I'm still not sure 
<br>
about &quot;extropian&quot;. I've dropped a lot of my reservations about it being 
<br>
applied to me, since I not only belong to this list but also have no 
<br>
problems with the current version of Max's Principles. However, I'd be very 
<br>
wary of actually using it of myself, since it probably sounds more cultish 
<br>
and jarring than &quot;transhuman&quot;.
<br>
<p>In some contexts, &quot;posthuman&quot; is probably more familiar than &quot;transhuman&quot;, 
<br>
but it is not necessarily used in quite the same way by writers, critics and 
<br>
academics interested in images of cyborgs etc, or in the projections of sf, 
<br>
as it is used by people on this list. Sometimes you can talk about 
<br>
&quot;cyberpunk&quot; or about &quot;post-cyberpunk&quot; if you're primarily talking about the 
<br>
way these ideas are handled in sf.
<br>
<p>All in all, I think the decision made by Mark and others is sensible PR. 
<br>
Does the journal retain some mechanism to narrow the sorts of contributions 
<br>
it wants to receive?
<br>
