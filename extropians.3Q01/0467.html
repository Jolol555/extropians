<br>
<em>&gt; Phogiston is obvious.  Consciousness, philosophy and mind, I think mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different things to different people.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly! One of the attributes that makes these terms useless is that no one
<br>
can pin discrete definitions on them. To function in a useful way, words need
<br>
to mean specific things. When no one can agree what they mean, they lose their
<br>
utility. The English language (and especially scientific language) can get
<br>
along just fine without meaningless words like these.
<br>
<p>Perhaps you read the article Max More posted about the phlogiston and
<br>
consciousness hypotheses?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why is analog computing on there?
</em><br>
<p>IIRC, it was John Clark who posted the definitive analysis of this oxymoronic
<br>
hypothetical dead end. In short, if it's analog, it can't be computed, and if
<br>
it's computable, the analog label doesn't apply. IOW, there's no such thing as
<br>
an analog computer, because information is digital. For example, a slide rule
<br>
is digital: See those little marks on the slider? Those represent digits. Look
<br>
closely enough at any apparently continuous surface and you'll find it's
<br>
composed of little bits of matter (and not-matter).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What does that mean?  Do you simply mean that digital is better, and can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplish everything analog so that we don't need it?
</em><br>
<p>No, I mean that truly analog computers do not in fact exist. Sufficiently
<br>
magnified, every vernier control becomes coarse and granular, hence digital.
<br>
Reality itself is atomistic and consequently digital. Some folks contend that
<br>
time is seamless and continuous. I say that time is an idea, a convenient way
<br>
to measure and track the way matter moves in space. In this respect, time is
<br>
the same kind of nonentity as the idea of a perfect circle or the numeral
<br>
three, because it exists only in relation to other facets of the real world,
<br>
and has no substance in and of itself. The so-called &quot;analog&quot; clock is really
<br>
digital because it divides the duration of an event (usually a day, the
<br>
frequency of a vibrating crystal, etc.) into specified segments: seconds,
<br>
milliseconds, nanoseconds, and so on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relativism?  Do you list it, because like communism, it doesn't seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work?
</em><br>
<p>I list cultural relativism on the advice of Eliezer S. Yudkowsky, who pointed
<br>
out to me that this particular term owes its invention to ideologues who deny
<br>
evolutionary psychology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  What about ELIZA?  Isn't that the stupid little program that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back?  What outrageous claims have been made for it that you would list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as useless?  As an amusing entertainment program, it does need much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uselessness.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, yes! We do need our uselessnesses, don't we? ô¿ô
<br>
Ultimately, existence itself is useless and without purpose. A
<br>
non-teleological approach to life yields the profoundest poetry, because it
<br>
appears to transcend human effort and intent (NB: &quot;appears&quot;). We enjoy those
<br>
silly things most which provide a break from the tedium of taking care of
<br>
business. ELIZA doesn't &quot;talk back&quot; it retrieves scripts as prompted by
<br>
distinct keystrokes -- just the opposite of talking back -- it obeys explicit
<br>
commands. The illusion is amusing... an entertaining diversion. I call it
<br>
useless because it masquerades as &quot;AI&quot; See:
<br>
<a href="http://www.spaceports.com/~sjlaven/eliza.htm">http://www.spaceports.com/~sjlaven/eliza.htm</a>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Eliza is the best known Artificial Intelligence program in the world. It is
<br>
also one of the oldest. Created in the early 1960's by MIT scientist Joseph
<br>
Weizenbaum and named after Eliza Doolittle, its mission was to attempt to
<br>
replicate the conversation between a psychoanalyst and a patient.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just curious about your list.  You should have a web page to explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list in more detail.  It would be interesting.  If you do have a web
</em><br>
<em>&gt; page,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you should include it in your sig.
</em><br>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion (really). I wonder if the usefulness of such a
<br>
web page could justify the time and resources required to produce and maintain
<br>
it.

<p>On Ignoring Useless Hypotheses

<br>
In the light of this, and since it is easier to ignore useless hypotheses than
<br>
to reconstruct useful ones, we now add them in when we generate the
<br>
elimination rule, which now looks like this:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;R_elim : {C_R:T1-&gt;..-&gt;Tn-&gt;UNIV} (* C_R does not depend on proofs of R *)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;({x1:t1}..{xk:tk}S1-&gt;..-&gt;Sn-&gt; (* rule1 case *)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(R p1 .. pn)-&gt;..-&gt;(R p'1 .. p'n)-&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C_R p1 .. pn)-&gt;..-&gt;(C_R p'1 .. p'n)-&gt;C_R c1 .. cn)-&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* more cases *)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{a1:T1}..{an:Tn}(R a1 .. an)-&gt;C_R a1 .. an

analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
