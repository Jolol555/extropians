<p>Hi Folks,
<br>
<p>I know time is a bit short on this, but it just occurred to me that the
<br>
people here would probably be interested because of the tech edge and
<br>
wearable computer involved.
<br>
<p>A Virtual Reality dance performance will be on at the Capitol theatre
<br>
tomorrow thru till the end of next week.
<br>
<p>The Capitol Theatre, 113 Swanston Street, Melbourne, Australia at 8pm.
<br>
On the 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15 September. Entry will be $22/$16.
<br>
<p>Company In Space are a dance group who have a reputation for doing very
<br>
technologically adventurous performances. This one is set inside virtual
<br>
worlds.
<br>
<p>The show is being calculated in real-time -- no image compositing. It is
<br>
experimental dance and music, so not everybody's cup of tea, but from a
<br>
technology point-of-view it is a geek's paradise. :-)
<br>
<p>Hellen, the dancer, will be dancing in the theatre before the audience and
<br>
will simultaneously be projected into virtual spaces on the big screen as
<br>
an avatar (the body you wear in a virtual world). She wears a special suit
<br>
that reads all her movements. She is also wearing a small single board
<br>
computer -- a Gene-4310 about the size of a CD case with a 233MHz Geode
<br>
processor -- which transmits all the movement data via a wireless network
<br>
to a group of other computers. At the moment the Gene-4310 is there simply
<br>
to relay data from the suit to the wireless LAN, but there are plans to
<br>
give Hellen a screen and a twiddler to let her control how her suit data is
<br>
used.
<br>
<p>One of those computers is a *very* fast laptop which uses the data to show
<br>
virtual environments and humanoids. Some aspects of the worlds and
<br>
humanoids (it changes a lot) are under Hellen's control, some aspects are
<br>
under the control of another computer in Florida, USA where a &quot;Flock of
<br>
Birds&quot; input system is being operated by someone else (in real time).
<br>
Sometimes Hellen's movement data causes the avatar being projected on the
<br>
screen of the theatre to mirror her movements, sometimes she operates
<br>
things like sound or light and the avatar (or something else) is controlled
<br>
from Florida.
<br>
<p>Expect the shows to evolve over the week and a half. If you want to come
<br>
along more than once John mentioned to me that a lower entry fee is
<br>
possible. This is such an extroadinary event -- way beyond anything I have
<br>
heard of here or anywhere else in the world.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Miriam

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
