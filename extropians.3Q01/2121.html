<em>&gt; Parallel universes are no longer a figment of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagination. They're so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real that we can reach out and touch them, and even use them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to change our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, says Marcus Chown
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Flicking through New Scientist, you stop at this page, think &quot;that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting&quot; and read these words. Another you thinks &quot;what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonsense&quot;, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moves on. Yet another lets out a cry, keels over and dies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is this an insane vision? Not according to David Deutsch of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the University
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Oxford. Deutsch believes that our Universe is part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiverse, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain of parallel universes that comprises ultimate reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Until now, the multiverse was a hazy, ill-defined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept-little more than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical trick. But in a paper yet to be published,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deutsch has worked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out the structure of the multiverse. With it, he claims, he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has answered the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last criticism of the sceptics. &quot;For 70 years physicists have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been hiding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from it, but they can hide no longer.&quot; If he's right, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiverse is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trick. It is real. So real that we can mould the fate of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploit them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why believe in something so extraordinary? Because it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatest mysteries of modern science: why the world of atoms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaves so very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differently from the everyday world of trees and tables.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The theory that describes atoms and their constituents is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum mechanics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is hugely successful. It has led to computers, lasers and nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reactors, and it tells us why the Sun shines and why the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ground beneath our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feet is solid. But quantum theory also tells us something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very disturbing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about atoms and their like: they can be in many places at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once. This isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just a crazy theory-it has observable consequences (see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Interfering with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the multiverse&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But how is it that atoms can be in many places at once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whereas big things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made out of atoms-tables, trees and pencils-apparently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot? Reconciling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the difference between the microscopic and the macroscopic is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the central
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem in quantum theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The many worlds interpretation is one way to do it. This idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was proposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Princeton graduate student Hugh Everett III in 1957.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worlds, quantum theory doesn't just apply to atoms, says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deutsch. &quot;The world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of tables is exactly the same as the world of atoms.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But surely this means tables can be in many places at once. Right. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nobody has ever seen such a schizophrenic table. So what gives?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idea is that if you observe a table that is in two places
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at once, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are also two versions of you-one that sees the table in one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place and one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that sees it in another place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The consequences are remarkable. A universe must exist for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility. There are Earths where the Nazis prevailed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Second World
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War, where Marilyn Monroe married Einstein, and where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dinosaurs survived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and evolved into intelligent beings who read New Scientist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, many worlds is not the only interpretation of quantum theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Physicists can choose between half a dozen interpretations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all of which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predict identical outcomes for all conceivable experiments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deutsch dismisses them all. &quot;Some are gibberish, like the Copenhagen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation,&quot; he says-and the rest are just variations on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the many worlds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theme.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, according to the Copenhagen interpretation, the act of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observing is crucial. Observation forces an atom to make up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its mind, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plump for being in only one place out of all the possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; places it could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be. But the Copenhagen interpretation is itself open to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitutes an observation? For some people, this only requires a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large-scale object such as a particle detector. For others it means an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interaction with some kind of conscious being.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Worse still, says Deutsch, is that in this type of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to abandon the idea of reality. Before observation, the atom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real position. To Deutsch, the whole thing is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mysticism-throwing up our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hands and saying there are some things we are not allowed to ask.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some interpretations do try to give the microscopic world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality, but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are all disguised versions of the many worlds idea, says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deutsch. &quot;Their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proponents have fallen over backwards to talk about the many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worlds in a way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that makes it appear as if they are not.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this category, Deutsch includes David Bohm's &quot;pilot-wave&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bohm's idea is that a quantum wave guides particles along their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trajectories. Then the strange shape of the pilot wave can be used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain all the odd quantum behaviours, such as interference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect, says Deutsch, Bohm's single universe occupies one groove in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immensely complicated multi-dimensional wave function.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The question that pilot-wave theorists must address is: what are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unoccupied grooves?&quot; says Deutsch. &quot;It is no good saying they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theoretical and do not exist physically, for they continually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jostle each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other and the occupied groove, affecting its trajectory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's really being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talked about here is parallel universes. Pilot-wave theories are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parallel-universe theories in a state of chronic denial.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Back and forth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another disguised many worlds theory, says Deutsch, is John Cramer's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;transactional&quot; interpretation in which information passes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backwards and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forwards through time. When you measure the position of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atom, it sends a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message back to its earlier self to change its trajectory accordingly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But as the system gets more complicated, the number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; messages explodes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soon, says Deutsch, it becomes vastly greater than the number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of particles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the Universe. The full quantum evolution of a system as big as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Universe consists of an exponentially large number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classical processes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each of which contains the information to describe a whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cramer's idea forces the multiverse on you, says Deutsch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So do other interpretations, according to Deutsch. &quot;Quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory leaves no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubt that other universes exist in exactly the same sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Universe that we see exists,&quot; he says. &quot;This is not a matter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation. It is a logical consequence of quantum theory.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet many physicists still refuse to accept the multiverse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;People say the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many worlds is simply too crazy, too wasteful, too mind-blowing,&quot; says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deutsch. &quot;But this is an emotional not a scientific reaction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take what nature gives us.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A much more legitimate objection is that many worlds is vague
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firm mathematical basis. Proponents talk of a multiverse that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stack of parallel universes. The critics point out that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple-quantum phenomena occur precisely because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universes interact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;What is needed is a precise mathematical model of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiverse,&quot; says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deutsch. And now he's made one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The key to Deutsch's model sounds peculiar. He treats the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiverse as if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it were a quantum computer. Quantum computers exploit the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strangeness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum systems-their ability to be in many states at once-to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kinds of calculation at ludicrously high speed. For example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly search huge databases that would take an ordinary computer the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lifetime of the Universe. Although the hardware is still at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stage, the theory of how quantum computers process information is well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In 1985, Deutsch proved that such a machine can simulate any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceivable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum system, and that includes the Universe itself. So to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic structure of the multiverse, all you need to do is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analyse a general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum calculation. &quot;The set of all programs that can be run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer includes programs that would simulate the multiverse,&quot; says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deutsch. &quot;So we don't have to include any details of stars
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and galaxies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the real Universe, we can just analyse quantum computers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look at how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information flows inside them.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If information could flow freely from one part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiverse to another,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we'd live in a chaotic world where all possibilities would overlap. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really would see two tables at once, and worse, everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imaginable would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be happening everywhere at the same time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deutsch found that, almost all the time, information flows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only within small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pieces of the quantum calculation, and not in between those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pieces. These
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pieces, he says, are separate universes. They feel separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and autonomous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because all the information we receive through our senses has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within one universe. As Oxford philosopher Michael Lockwood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put it, &quot;We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot look sideways, through the multiverse, any more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can look into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes universes in Deutsch's model peel apart only locally and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fleetingly, and then slap back together again. This is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause of quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interference, which is at the root of everything from the two-slit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment to the basic structure of atoms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other physicists are still digesting what Deutsch has to say. Anton
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Zeilinger of the University of Vienna remains unconvinced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The multiverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation is not the only possible one, and it is not even the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simplest,&quot; he says. Zeilinger instead uses information theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very different conclusions. He thinks that quantum theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes from limits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the information we get out of measurements (New Scientist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 17 February, p
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 26). As in the Copenhagen interpretation, there is no reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to what goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on before the measurement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But Deutsch insists that his picture is more profound than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Zeilinger's. &quot;I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope he'll come round, and realise that the many worlds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory explains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the information in his measurements comes from.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why are physicists reluctant to accept many worlds? Deutsch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blames logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positivism, the idea that science should concern itself only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with objects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can be observed. In the early 20th century, some logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positivists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even denied the existence of atoms-until the evidence became
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overwhelming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The evidence for the multiverse, according to Deutsch, is equally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overwhelming. &quot;Admittedly, it's indirect,&quot; he says. &quot;But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then, we can detect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pterodactyls and quarks only indirectly too. The evidence that other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universes exist is at least as strong as the evidence for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pterodactyls or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quarks.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps the sceptics will be convinced by a practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstration of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiverse. And Deutsch thinks he knows how. By building a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum computer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he says, we can reach out and mould the multiverse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;One day, a quantum computer will be built which does more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simultaneous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculations than there are particles in the Universe,&quot; says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deutsch. &quot;Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Universe as we see it lacks the computational resources to do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculations, where are they being done?&quot; It can only be in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other universes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he says. &quot;Quantum computers share information with huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers of versions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of themselves throughout the multiverse.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine that you have a quantum PC and you set it a problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What happens is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a huge number of versions of your PC split off from this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Universe into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own separate, local universes, and work on parallel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strands of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem. A split second later, the pocket universes recombine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into one, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those strands are pulled together to provide the answer that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pops up on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; screen. &quot;Quantum computers are the first machines humans have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever built to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploit the multiverse directly,&quot; says Deutsch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At the moment, even the biggest quantum computers can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work their magic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on about 6 bits of information, which in Deutsch's view means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they exploit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copies of themselves in 26 universes-that's just 64 of them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational feats of such computers are puny, people can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose to ignore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the multiverse. &quot;But something will happen when the number of parallel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculations becomes very large,&quot; says Deutsch. &quot;If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number is 64, people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can shut their eyes but if it's 1064, they will no longer be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretend.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What would it mean for you and me to know there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconceivably many yous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and mes living out all possible histories? Surely, there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no point in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making any choices for the better if all possible outcomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen? We might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well stay in bed or commit suicide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deutsch does not agree. In fact, he thinks it could make real choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible. In classical physics, he says, there is no such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing as &quot;if&quot;; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future is determined absolutely by the past. So there can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no free will.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the multiverse, however, there are alternatives; the quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibilities really happen. Free will might have a sensible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deutsch thinks, because the alternatives don't have to occur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within equally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large slices of the multiverse. &quot;By making good choices,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing, we thicken the stack of universes in which versions of us live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable lives,&quot; he says. &quot;When you succeed, all the copies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of you who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made the same decision succeed too. What you do for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better increases the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; portion of the multiverse where good things happen.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's hope that deciding to read this article was the right choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interfering with the multiverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can see the shadow of other universes using little more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source and two metal plates. This is the famous double-slit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; touchstone of quantum weirdness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Particles from the atomic realm such as photons, electrons or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atoms are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fired at the first plate, which has two vertical slits in it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The particles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that go through hit the second plate on the far side.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine the places that are hit show up black and that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; places that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not hit show up white. After the experiment has been running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a while,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and many particles have passed through the slits, the plate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be covered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in vertical stripes alternating black and white. That is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pattern.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To make it, particles that passed through one slit have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interfere with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particles that passed through the other slit. The pattern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form if you shut one slit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The strange thing is that the interference pattern forms even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if particles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come one at a time, with long periods in between. So what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affecting these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single particles?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to the many worlds interpretation, each particle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interferes with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another particle going through the other slit. What other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particle? &quot;Another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particle in a neighbouring universe,&quot; says David Deutsch. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believes this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a case where two universes split apart briefly, within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then come back together again. &quot;In my opinion, the argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worlds was won with the double-slit experiment. It reveals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between neighbouring universes, the root of all quantum phenomena.&quot;
</em><br>

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;May we all live in eternity's sunrise,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the seashore of endless worlds.&quot;
