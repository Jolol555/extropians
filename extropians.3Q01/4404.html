If the medics are getting so good at body mods they can
<br>
cause a penis to grow out of one's arm, then they should be able to make a vagina grow into the other arm.  Some sports would be out of the question, I suppose, however a plethora of new ones become possible. 
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I remember neither the title or author, but I once read an excellent(and very sad) short story of dark fantasy about a woman who has additional vaginas added to her body in an attempt to please her husband.  
<br>
<p>One by one they are added, but the husband always thinks another would be even better.  He likes having more and more men enjoy his wife while at the same time he does.
<br>
<p>In the end all she does is simply not enough.  The story ends on a very sad note.  I felt the author was making a point about sexual excess and the nature of co-dependance.
