I can confirm this phenomenon, but also that there is a different
<br>
relationship between robbers and their victims in those countries than
<br>
here. A business associate was in Rio visiting freinds when a robber
<br>
with a pistol entered the house (which was surrounded by a high wall and
<br>
alarmed gates) and robbed each person at gunpoint. Everyone quietly gave
<br>
the theif their money and jewelry, and the theif calmly left the
<br>
premises. Afterwards, my freind Andy asked why nobody defended
<br>
themselves, and they replied with shocked looks, &quot;We just give them what
<br>
they want and they go away, and nobody gets hurt.&quot; In reaction to his
<br>
dumbfounded look, they asked, &quot;How does it work in the US?&quot; 
<br>
Andy replied,&quot;In the US, if you give them your money, they then shoot
<br>
you anyways, so nobody can ID them to police.&quot;
