<p><em>&gt; Harvey writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However, I would be very curious to see any references that also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; claim such a thing.  Are there any studies or references to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your assertion that &quot;Cubans&quot; aren't as punctual as &quot;Mormons&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How Latin Americans view punctuality as opposed to Mormons can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be found in the works of Edward T. Hall, e.g., &quot;The Silent Language&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I've had that book for decades (maybe it is becoming outdated?).  A few
<br>
years ago I was in Spain and Portugal, and got the distinct impression that
<br>
the traditional &quot;siesta&quot; hour was on the wane.  Westernization, tourist
<br>
dollars, and (at the time of my visit) the advent of the Euro dollar were
<br>
all having an impact.  Books like Hall's have a short shelf life, IMO -
<br>
consider that it was written before all the technical advances we've gone
<br>
through in the last couple of decades (before CNN, even).  And in Italy
<br>
(which I visited just last October) Internet cafes are springing up in
<br>
medieval buildings - and Italy's shopping malls are indistinguishable from
<br>
the ones in the United States.   I'm not saying Hall's book is completely
<br>
irrelevant, but it has lost some of its relevancy through the years, and
<br>
will probably keep losing even more relevance (at an accelerated rate) in
<br>
the years to come.
