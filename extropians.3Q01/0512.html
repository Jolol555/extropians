<br>
<em>&gt; Arrg. Where to start?
</em><br>
<p>Hi M. E.,
<br>
<p>Well, if you don't want to start at the beginning, we can start at the end:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is funny (to me) that this argument about religion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recurs on a yearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basis on this list. &quot;Methinks he doth protest too much.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like a personal problem (and probably not just to me), but not a
<br>
particularly funny one. I protest that you do think too little. This argument
<br>
about religiosity recurs annually (or more often) because religiosity is a
<br>
perennial weed in the gardens of extropy and transhumanism. To prevent this
<br>
noxious weed taking over and strangling the useful plants, application of some
<br>
industrial strength weed killer does not seem inappropriate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I admit that the book in question (&quot;Why God Won't Go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Away&quot;) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annoying in the sense that it frequently goes out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its way to present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its findings in the language of Western religion (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; title being an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example of this), but I assume you actually did more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than read the title.
</em><br>
<p>Right, the dangerous and irresponsible nature of religiosity, causing (as it
<br>
has) over five thousand wars in the last three thousand years, requires more
<br>
than reading. That's why &quot;drastic measures&quot; are appropriate. When dealing with
<br>
brain dysfunction, medication does a better job.
<br>
<p>Religious fanatics are dishonest if they are not mentally ill, because only
<br>
psychologically disturbed people could believe the childish mythology of
<br>
miracles and fantasy that makes up religionism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I put it to you that the findings of the authors of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WGWGA support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this bit of &quot;religiosity&quot;. Therefore, your mentioning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this book,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the context of &quot;Debunk All Religiosity Equally&quot;, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wierd to me.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I suppose dealing with reason does feel &quot;weird&quot; to religious fanatics. It
<br>
would be irrational to think that religiosity can be debunked sufficiently to
<br>
remove it from the ailing brain in which it resides. Therefore, one can even
<br>
imagine brains addled by religion hallucinating that the authors of
<br>
_Why God Won't Go Away: Brain Science and the Biology of Belief_,
<br>
by Andrew Newberg, Eugene D'Aquili, and Vince Rause
<br>
Ballantine, New York, 2001. 234 pp. $24.95, C$37.95. ISBN: 0-345-44033-1
<br>
in any way &quot;support&quot; religiosity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is arguably a central premise of certain religions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nice to be rid of &quot;the whole darn tormenting thing&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of being a separate &quot;Self&quot;, and that furthermore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom is possible.
</em><br>
<p>Unless you are arguing with your &quot;Self,&quot; the sense of separation is neither a
<br>
premise nor arguable. Anyone with enough courage and honesty can conduct this
<br>
experiment right now. It has _nothing_ to do with religionism. It has to do
<br>
with direct experience of reality. Simply allow all imagination and words to
<br>
cease and desist, to fall out of view, to precipitate away from your
<br>
attention, while you remain wide awake and alert, and suddenly it becomes
<br>
clear that you are the world, all at once the constraints of dogma and
<br>
doctrine evaporate and you are free, and the walls that belief systems have
<br>
put together fall down to reveal endless liberation in all directions. It is
<br>
more a matter of seeing than of thinking. Religiosity, in stark contrast to
<br>
this, is the first and last psychological prison of humanity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's very wierd (to me) that you even brought up this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (excellent)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book in this context.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is the context which matters most. In the context of a world mad with
<br>
religious wars, where religionists are willing to die for the memes that have
<br>
infected their brains, where the security of the entire planet is threatened
<br>
by zealouts who deliberately attempt to fulfill the apocalyptic prophecies of
<br>
their sacred scriptures (at the expense of anyone who gets in their way),
<br>
where Inquisitions and witchhunts seek to silence every voice of reason, where
<br>
infallible popery masquerades as compassion, where innocent children are
<br>
taught to hate and kill anyone who does not embrace their parents pious
<br>
fanaticism, where parochialism and provincialism spawn divisiveness in the
<br>
name of diversity, where nearly the whole human race is cognitively crippled
<br>
and lives in fear of tyrants who threaten damnation and eternal hell for
<br>
disobeying asinine religious edicts, where ceremony and tradition stifle
<br>
original ideas and new solutions, it becomes clear why the phrase &quot;to make a
<br>
religion out of it&quot; means to alienate from freedom something that was once
<br>
beautiful and to deform it into an ugly form of psychological death.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, on this list, not less than Mr. Max More
</em><br>
<em>&gt; himself has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressed the desire to be able to temporarily turn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off his sex drive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a desire I fully understand. It would be nice to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole darn tormenting thing.
</em><br>
<p>Easily done. Try Paxil, Celexa, Zoloft, Prozac, or some other SSRI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The &quot;usual&quot; sense of self no doubt won out in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Darwinian sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it drives us to actions which ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result in more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offspring, but then, obviously, so does the &quot;usual&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state of our sex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drives.
</em><br>
<p>No, this is not at all &quot;obvious&quot; because our sex drives do not drive
<br>
Darwinism, Neo-Darwinian evolution, Deep Evolution, nor our sense of self. The
<br>
best way to transcend biological drives is to indulge them to the point of
<br>
satiety, when doing so harms no one. The anti-sex facet of religiosity results
<br>
in repression, which leads to all sorts of perverse sexual behavior as the
<br>
pent-up libido must find an outlet. That may explain why there are so many sex
<br>
perverts and pedophiles in monasteries, churches, temples, and mosques. Sexual
<br>
liberation threatens religionists because their particular type of bigotry
<br>
denies sex and sexuality, and this denial is yet another indication of their
<br>
dishonesty and irresponsibility.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus, &quot;unusual&quot; brain states in which the boundaries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our &quot;self&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are radically altered are not neccessarily &quot;less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representations&quot; of reality. Perhaps they are like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equally valid reference frames involved when doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple analyses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the kinematics of playing tennis on a moving train,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps you need to have a good orgasm to dispel these delusions. Sadly, the
<br>
most &quot;unusual&quot; brain state in the world is one completely free of esoteric
<br>
speculation about reality. &quot;Different but equally valid reference frames&quot; are
<br>
no substitute for the real thing, particularly when analyzing anything about
<br>
moving trains. If you ever come to your senses, you'll find that it radically
<br>
alters your analyses, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Perhaps you should add &quot;the Self&quot; to your list of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useless hypotheses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in your signature line.)
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion, but &quot;the Self&quot; doesn't qualify for this select
<br>
list, because no one really hypothesizes &quot;the Self.&quot; Instead, almost everyone
<br>
grows up inloading this delusion by cultural osmosis. IOW, it's a product of
<br>
evolutionary psychology and emotional conditioning rather than deliberate
<br>
hypothesis. Furthermore, you have demonstrated the usefulness of the mirage of
<br>
&quot;the Self&quot; in the presentation of your comments here. You have written, &quot;It is
<br>
funny (to me) that this argument about religion recurs...&quot; Who is this &quot;me&quot; if
<br>
not &quot;the Self&quot; that you pretend to disown? You are quite caught up in the
<br>
mirage of &quot;the Self,&quot; while admonishing everyone else to dispose of it. A
<br>
cunning move, and selfish to boot, but to no avail.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are our hearts part of our selves, when they can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replaced with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artifical pumps? Our lungs, are they part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves? We need them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to live, but then, we also need all the plants out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there that produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the oxygen our lungs breathe, and we don't usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of THEM as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of our &quot;self&quot;. We can't live without our local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; star, the sun,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (yet); is it part of our &quot;self&quot;? We can live without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our left hand; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it NOT part of our &quot;self&quot;? Just where does our &quot;self&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of the universe begin?
</em><br>
<p>Right. Everyone sing with the Beatles:
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;I-am-you-and-you-are-me-and-we-are-all-together&quot;
<br>
So, who is asking these questions, and to whom are they directed?
<br>
You've got the words down, but you've yet to act on them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fact that, in these same experiences, the sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Self&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radically altered does not obviously relegate such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain states to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the category of undesirable dementia. The notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;self&quot; is really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a problem logically, as this list frequently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrates, when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject of &quot;uploading&quot;, et cetera, come up.
</em><br>
<p>It's really no &quot;problem&quot; at all. It's merely an illusion that doesn't hurt
<br>
anyone else, because there's no one else to hurt. So... get over it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Obviously, SOME states can be argued &quot;a less accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representation&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than others (death; sleep, etc.); but the kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altered states that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are the focus of WGWGA involve heightened awareness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surroundings,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improved abilities, greater senses of well-being, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other things
</em><br>

<br>
&quot;This fascinating and thought-provoking book by two neurologists and a veteran
<br>
journalist reflects the two physicians' long-term interests in the role of
<br>
religious experience in the mind and its location in the brain. Their studies
<br>
were most often done with the aid of single photon emission computed
<br>
tomography (SPECT), a process in which the subject need not be in a machine
<br>
while it is working. SPECT allows all involved to work in an informal
<br>
atmosphere, which has undoubtedly made the results obtained more closely
<br>
reflect both religious and neurological reality. Early on, the authors assert
<br>
that &quot;biology, in some way, compels the spiritual urge.&quot; They know the
<br>
literature of their field and of religious experience, as well as the history
<br>
of the mind and brain. They write lucidly, analogize effectively and often
<br>
strikingly, and delightfully combine science and human interest. Their
<br>
arguments are cogent, and their observations and questions should keep readers
<br>
seriously involved.

<p>Book Description
<br>
Why have we humans always longed to connect with something larger than
<br>
ourselves? Why does consciousness inevitably involve us in a spiritual quest?
<br>
Why, in short, won't God go away? Theologians, philosophers, and psychologists
<br>
have debated this question through the ages, arriving at a range of
<br>
contradictory and ultimately unprovable answers. But in this brilliant,
<br>
groundbreaking new book, researchers Andrew Newberg and Eugene d'Aquili offer
<br>
an explanation that is at once profoundly simple and scientifically precise:
<br>
the religious impulse is rooted in the biology of the brain.
<br>
Newberg and d'Aquili base this revolutionary conclusion on a long-term
<br>
investigation of brain function and behavior as well as studies they conducted
<br>
using high-tech imaging techniques to examine the brains of meditating
<br>
Buddhists and Franciscan nuns at prayer. What they discovered was that
<br>
intensely focused spiritual contemplation triggers an alteration in the
<br>
activity of the brain that leads us to perceive transcendent religious
<br>
experiences as solid and tangibly real. In other words, the sensation that
<br>
Buddhists call &quot;oneness with the universe&quot; and the Franciscans attribute to
<br>
the palpable presence of God is not a delusion or a manifestation of wishful
<br>
thinking but rather a chain of neurological events that can be objectively
<br>
observed, recorded, and actually photographed.
<br>
The inescapable conclusion is that God is hard-wired into the human brain.
<br>
In Why God Won't Go Away, Newberg and d'Aquili document their pioneering
<br>
explorations in the field of neurotheology, an emerging discipline dedicated
<br>
to understanding the complex relationship between spirituality and the brain.
<br>
Along the way, they delve into such essential questions as whether humans are
<br>
biologically compelled to make myths; what is the evolutionary connection
<br>
between religious ecstasy and sexual orgasm; what do Near Death Experiences
<br>
reveal about the nature of spiritual phenomena; and how does ritual create its
<br>
own neurological environment. As their journey unfolds, Newberg and d'Aquili
<br>
realize that a single, overarching question lies at the heart of their
<br>
pursuit: Is religion merely a product of biology or has the human brain been
<br>
mysteriously endowed with the unique capacity to reach and know God?
<br>
Blending cutting-edge science with illuminating insights into the nature of
<br>
consciousness and spirituality, Why God Won't Go Away bridges faith and
<br>
reason, mysticism and empirical data. The neurological basis of how the brain
<br>
identifies the &quot;real&quot; is nothing short of miraculous. This fascinating,
<br>
eye-opening book dares to explore both the miracle and the biology of our
<br>
enduring relationship with God.

<br>
---------------------
<br>
Over the centuries, theories have abounded as to why human beings have a
<br>
seemingly irrational attraction to God and religious experiences. In Why God
<br>
Won't Go Away authors Andrew Newberg, M.D., Eugene D'Aquili, M.D., and Vince
<br>
Rause offer a startlingly simple, yet scientifically plausible opinion: humans
<br>
seek God because our brains are biologically programmed to do so.
<br>
Researchers Newberg and D'Aquili used high-tech imaging devices to peer into
<br>
the brains of meditating Buddhists and Franciscan nuns. As the data and brain
<br>
photographs flowed in, the researchers began to find solid evidence that the
<br>
mystical experiences of the subjects &quot;were not the result of some fabrication,
<br>
or simple wishful thinking, but were associated instead with a series of
<br>
observable neurological events,&quot; explains Newberg. &quot;In other words, mystical
<br>
experience is biologically, observably, and scientifically real.... Gradually,
<br>
we shaped a hypothesis that suggests that spiritual experience, at its very
<br>
root, is intimately interwoven with human biology.&quot; Lay readers should be
<br>
warned that although the topic is fascinating, the writing is geared toward
<br>
scientific documentation that defends the authors' hypothesis. For a more
<br>
palatable discussion, seek out Deepak Chopra's How to Know God, in which he
<br>
also explores this fascinating evidence of spiritual hard-wiring. --Gail
<br>

<br>
<p>So, my point is that if we can locate the area of the brain responsible for
<br>
religious ecstasy, perhaps we can also locate the area of the brain
<br>
responsible for violent religious zealotry... and remove it like a wart or a
<br>
tumor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is important to realize is that the brain, in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very real sense,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defines our experience of reality. All of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience with &quot;reality&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is mediated by the systems of the brain. That the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain can be in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different &quot;states&quot; at different times is obvious; what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is why one &quot;state&quot; should be considered &quot;a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accurate representation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of reality&quot; than another.
</em><br>
<p>An important thing to understand is that the brain is the part of reality that
<br>
has mistakenly considered itself a mystical essence instead of the organ of
<br>
perception. If it is not obvious to you why an accurate representation of
<br>
reality requires a dynamic and pancritical rationalism, it is thankfully
<br>
understandble to those who have tried to make it more obvious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The book in question (&quot;Why God Won't Go Away...&quot; =
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WGWGA) reveals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how under certain circumstances (meditation, etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain subsystems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the brain temporarily &quot;shut down&quot; (and some others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actively), and some of the subsystems that &quot;shut down&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are associated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with defining the border between &quot;the Self&quot; and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe. The authors propose that this explains why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the subject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences &quot;oneness with the universe&quot;, etc, yadda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yadda.
</em><br>
<p>Meditation does _not_ mean the same thing as religiosity. It is religiosity
<br>
that needs debunking, not meditation. When neuroscience can pinpoint the area
<br>
of the brain that causes the dangerous and all too often violent behavior
<br>
associated with religious fanaticism, then it will have rendered a more
<br>
beneficial service than locating areas of the brain which are active during
<br>
supposed meditation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This tends to &quot;debunk&quot; the premise of &quot;Debunk All
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Religiosity Equally&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but that should be obvious. (Would you propose to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophies equally? How about economic systems; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equally bad?)
</em><br>
<p>It may be &quot;obvious&quot; or seem that way to you, but I doubt it. I rather think
<br>
you know better, and that you're just trolling for a flame war. You are
<br>
probably not stupid enough to believe that I'd propose anything of the sort
<br>
you mention. Your implication that I would do so belies your dishonesty and
<br>
attempted deception.

<em>&gt; but it just as arguably ALSO does REINFORCE OTHER
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspects of OTHER
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;religious&quot; beliefs.
</em><br>
<p>Thank you for conceding that which is self-evident to any reasonable observer
<br>
(the first part of your rant), but this does not logically lead to the
<br>
conclusion of the last part of your rant. That fact that religious experience
<br>
resides in a part of the human brain in no way excuses the mass murders and
<br>
mayhem inflicted upon the human population by religious fanatics and zealots
<br>
(the Crusades and the Inquistion to mention just two). One might as well try
<br>
to excuse the actions of rapists on the grounds that sexual gratification
<br>
operates in a particular area of the brain. The real value of Newberg's and
<br>
d'Aquili's book is to demystify rather than to debunk the subject under
<br>
investigation. Debunking will, as I've mentioned, require stronger research
<br>
methods and correctional action. To conflate meditative experience with
<br>
religious fanaticism is a cheap trick of the lowest kind. Shame on you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The book in question is in the same general genre as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Austin's &quot;Zen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the Brain&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>The two books are in the same general category because they were both written
<br>
by authors who did not themselves directly experience the epiphenomenon of
<br>
which they write. While this seems laudable in that it appears to preserve
<br>
scientific objectivity, it corresponds to someone who has never had an orgasm
<br>
writing a book about love and sex.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You're argument has generally been that all religions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are bad and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be wiped out (through force?), and then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn around and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recommend a book which presents &quot;mystical experiences&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light, revealing how they have their basis in actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurrences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the brain.
</em><br>
<p>Please re-read the subject line. It reads &quot;Debunk All Religiosity...&quot; Your
<br>
over-reaction and defensiveness shows how weak you must feel. It shows in the
<br>
way you twist this into &quot;wiped out (through force?).&quot; To reiterate, &quot;mystical
<br>
experiences&quot; do not equate to religiosity. Debunk means &quot;to render ineffective
<br>
&nbsp;by exposing the false pretensions of,&quot; according to my dictionary... which is
<br>
what I've done about you. Since you are a troll, go back to lurking. Welcome
