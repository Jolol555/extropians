On Friday at 4:14 I had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I would approve of people seeking a middle-ground: we have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; publicly retain the traditions that created success and wealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in the first place, but also exercise charity in those local
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; situations about which we are very knowledgable, and judge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that it can do some good.
</em><br>
<p>and Jerry Mitchell retorted
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So once you are in this glorious middle ground, what principle do you use to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guide your decisions? If someone breaks in my house, do I ask their demands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and only give them half of that? Principles are there to guide you and yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they must be taken to logical extremes.
</em><br>
<p>The there are two non-conflicting principles at work here that
<br>
I uphold:  (1) government money should not be used at the present
<br>
time to support charity  (2) each person is free to be charitable
<br>
to whomever he pleases, and probably knows of private situations---
<br>
or even situations encountered on the street---which according to
<br>
his own judgment, his private charity would achieve good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So here we are having given up the principle that property cannot be taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and now we sit back and argue what is the proper amount to take, with no way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to answer that question... With the result being a slide into socialism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then communism, then dictatorship and death (unless the singularity saves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us!).
</em><br>
<p>I think that taking someone's property is sometimes a necessary
<br>
evil.  I do not think that it should be undertaken lightly, but
<br>
I have seen many cases in history where the only way that the
<br>
(relatively) good guys were going to win was to compromise their
<br>
principles.  These situations are outrageous, and no amount of
<br>
public apology (once the emergency is over) is sufficient.
<br>
<p>If your little tribe was under attack by cannibals, and you were
<br>
out of powder, and some rich old coot was discovered to have to
<br>
have a stash of it, which is better:  stealing his powder, at
<br>
gunpoint if need be, or being eaten by the cannibals?
<br>
<p>But you *may* be right.  Maybe the very first time, to
<br>
take the U.S. as an example, free men were drafted into armies,
<br>
the eventual slide into communism centuries later was inevitable.
<br>
Sometimes it seems that way.  But it remains to be seen.  Don't
<br>
give up yet!  We can still support the principle that &quot;that
<br>
government governs best which governs least&quot;.
<br>
