<p>Actually, the rationale for the Capital Gains Tax is to INCREASE tax
<br>
revinues by stimulating more market activity. They also, you didn't
<br>
mention, want to couple this with a rise in the minimum wage since the
<br>
past several increases in the minimum wage have proven to be
<br>
non-inflationary in impact. The Democrats are all for this, though a
<br>
side effect of this will be that more small businesses will be forced to
<br>
employ prisoners, who are not subject to minimum wage protections.
