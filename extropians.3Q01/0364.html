<em>&gt; &gt;He thinks old people are a burden on society,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;though, and is somewhat anti-life extension. Anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;who could provide me with links/info to combat that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;attitude, please do--he is incredibly intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmm. Funny, though, how even the incredibly intelligent seem unable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow the simple logic beyond the current parlous transitional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *Nobody* wants to live to 120 if that means 40 years as a vegetable, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slow physical and mental decay. The goal of life extension is *drastic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cellular repair and maintenance*, in the first instance, and *enhancement*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a likely next step from there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's like moaning, `Oh, what's the point of being cryonically preserved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after death? You'll never be able to move or talk again, all frozen stiff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like that!' Biostasis is intended a temporary condition, obviously. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current life extension methods, primitive as they are, should be regarded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a way to hang on (`like grim death', as they say) until genomics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proteomics and/or nanotech yield methods for (1) stalling and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repairing existing damage, and (2) maintaining [regained] youthful health
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perpetually, or until a better option comes along (such as, for example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading into a more fluent body or life-space).
</em><br>
<p>The (long, FAQ-like) front page of www.transhumanist.org has a very good,
<br>
short, punchy take on this (um...<a href="http://www.transhumanist.org/#longer">http://www.transhumanist.org/#longer</a>, I
<br>
think). Ideal for presenting as an argument to those not already in the
<br>
choir.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fear of Tithonus, who in myth grew ever older and more feeble, to his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrified despair, is a rudimentary failure of imagination. We'll get past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, just as we got over the fear of Icarus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (See Dr Chris Lawson's essay `The Tithonus Option is Not an Option' at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~claw/index.html">http://members.ozemail.com.au/~claw/index.html</a> )
</em><br>
<p>Good stuff. Can anyone point me to other essays on the same specific
<br>
topic -- the widespread myth/belief in new forms of longevity translating to
<br>
increasing enfeeblement with increasing age?
<br>
<p>I always used to worry about my brain, back in the day. Well, worry about it
<br>
degrading (as opposed to any of the other myriad things that are no doubt
<br>
wrong with it) even if various scenarios fixed the rest of the body. Five
<br>
years ago, I was pondering timelines for nanotech replacement of living
<br>
neurons with artificial neurons and whether that could happen before you
<br>
couldn't think anymore.
<br>
<p>So, since it's on my mind again: how fast and in what sized portions can you
<br>
replace parts of your living brain with artificial neurons and not have
<br>
discovered an extremely novel and expensive way of killing yourself? Take
<br>
out half the brain, destructively copy it, put the copy back in -- sounds
<br>
like killing yourself to me. You'll have left a copy behind, but the
<br>
essential you is dead. One neuron per minute sounds reasonable. It's an
<br>
interesting thing to think about -- how much of a system can you replace at
<br>
once with having been said to have destroyed the original system?
