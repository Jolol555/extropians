<p>So you reckon that people at the bottom of the economic ladder should get 
<br>
to send their kids to the same kind of school that they do now but pay for it?
<br>
<p>OK. :-) Do you remember why these people are called poor? It is because 
<br>
they don't have money. Given the choice between putting food on the table 
<br>
and getting their kids some kind of education, guess which will get dropped.
<br>
<p>If the upper classes don't want a poverty-stricken class that is self 
<br>
perpetuating, hates the rich vehemently, and is a breeding ground for 
<br>
disease and warped memes, then they need to do the sensible and humane 
<br>
thing and ensure that kids of the poor have a chance at a better life. 
<br>
Often the only way to do that is to give them a good education -- free.
<br>
<p>I have nothing against private education, but it is not the solution to all 
<br>
educational needs. Likewise free market economics can be extremely useful, 
<br>
but there are definite limits to its usefulness.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
