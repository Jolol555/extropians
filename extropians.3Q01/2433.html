<p><em>&gt; Are you saying that whites DIDN'T profit from slave labor?
</em><br>
<p>My God, for the record, in caps, 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT IS ENTIRELY TRUE, WITH NO QUALIFICATIONS WHATSOEVER,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THAT SLAVERY WAS A HIDEOUS EVIL, AND WHITES WERE THE
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ONES IN NORTH AMERICA WHO PROFITTED FROM IT AND 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ORCHESTRATED IT.
<br>
<p>Would you kindly *carefully* read people's posts?  I was debating
<br>
her assertion that this is not widely known in the U.S.  I'm sorry,
<br>
but my statement
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; You are quite wrong.  I don't think I've ever [met] anyone so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; so ignorant of history as to be unaware of slavery.
</em><br>
<p>is about as clear as I can make it.  If you aren't going to 
<br>
understand that---i.e., try to make it sound as if I didn't
<br>
know that whites profitted from slave labor, then we're doomed.
<br>
Why even try to write coherently about anything if blatant
<br>
misrepresentations like this are going to occur.
<br>
<p>And, poor me, I tried to be as inoffensive to all parties on
<br>
this list as I could be, without provoking a general rehash
<br>
of &quot;the causes of the civil war&quot; when I wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It's usually put forth as the reason that the Civil War
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; was fought, &quot;to free the slaves&quot;.  Abraham Lincoln is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; probably best known &quot;for freeing the slaves.&quot;  Okay :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; maybe you didn't hear this growing up because you weren't here.
</em><br>
<p>But I don't blame you so much (only a little) for finding that
<br>
confusing.  You weren't aware that I was talking about the
<br>
state of &quot;everyone's&quot; beliefs, not about what was true.  As
<br>
it happens, I agree with you that slavery was the root cause
<br>
of the civil war, the fundamental cause, and the main cause.
<br>
(There were also other causes.)  Happy?
<br>
<p>Lee Corbin
<br>
<p>P.S.  I can see why most of the time you only lurk.

<em>&gt; Lee - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Congratulations on getting me to de-lurk. That takes a lot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When you say that someone is &quot;quite wrong,&quot; a little specificity would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help. I can find nothing in Olga's statement that is untrue. Are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying that whites DIDN'T profit from slave labor? Or that slaves didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide much of the labor to build the White House? When you say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Civil War wasn't fought to free the slaves, you're just dancing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around the issue, which in any case is merely tangential, at best. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you next intend to suggest, as is popular in some circles, that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue of slavery wasn't the root cause of the Civil War, then it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become painfully obvious that you are the one who is &quot;ignorant of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history,&quot; or at least have exposed yourself only to the most biased and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atavistic sources. Rather than clutter up the list with a lengthy post
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on that tired subject I'll direct you to something I threw together on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this subject:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~pierres/opinions/opinion050800.html">http://www.eskimo.com/~pierres/opinions/opinion050800.html</a>. I was kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of hoping this would be cleared up by the close of the previous century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - now I'm shooting for 2100. The persistence of this type of BS is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself enough to disprove the myth of inevitable progress.
