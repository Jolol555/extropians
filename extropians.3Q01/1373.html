<p>
I'm getting the feeling that people haven't read my
<br>
papers in detail, or I'm not making myself clear in
<br>
my messages, so I'll make *one* more try:
<br>
<p>Eugene wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt; Not quite, it's a statistical argument. Out of a population of cultures,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only expansive ones will autoamplify for their signatures to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detectable over astronomical distances.
</em><br>
<p>Not if convergent evolution drives all *conscious* beings
<br>
to realize that *expansion* is pointless.
<br>
<p>(a) Life, of the non-conscious variety can expand only very
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slowly (panspermia via meteors).
<br>
(b) Life, of the non-technological variety can't expand any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faster than the non-conscious variety.
<br>
(c) Life, of the non-conscious &amp; non-technological varieties
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is subject to natural selection via planetary &amp; galactic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hazards that probably resets the clock relatively frequently.
<br>
(d) Rare life of the conscious technological variety rapidly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;makes it through the singularity transition.
<br>
(e) Natural selection *FAILS* when the S-curve of the singularity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flattens out at the top with the complete optimization of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all local matter at the atomic engineering scale.
<br>
<p>Just as humans have *almost* trumped natural selection on
<br>
the Earth (no more bears in Europe or tigers in India...),
<br>
JBrains &amp; MBrains will trump natural selection in the universe.
<br>
They &quot;FIX&quot; the hazard function so it is virtually nonexistant
<br>
(at least until the protons decay).  After you trump natural
<br>
selection, the logical game is self-directed conscious evolution
<br>
(which may rely on natural selection for internal development
<br>
strategies, but it isn't visible externally).
<br>
<p>The path of evolution is to drive complexification, but you cannot
<br>
complexify in an efficient manner unless you know what has been
<br>
tried and failed.  There is a huge cost to trying something that
<br>
has already been tried which doesn't work.  Nature doesn't care
<br>
about this (e.g. it will try &quot;failures&quot; again and again) because
<br>
it doesn't give a damn about the optimal allocation of limited
<br>
resources.  Advanced conscious technological civilizations *do* care
<br>
about such allocations because the cost of getting any more of them
<br>
is high.  Sure, there is lots around to grab, but once you have them,
<br>
they can't communicate to you what designs have been tried and fail due to
<br>
the speed of light delays and large-body-of-information communication costs.
<br>
<p>The bigger the wavefront, the slower you have to go unless
<br>
you consciously, intentionally want to waste the resources
<br>
(e.g. two MBrains on opposite sides of the wavefront are
<br>
trying the exact same sub-atomic engineering designs at
<br>
exactly the same time).
<br>
<p>For reasons, like the black hole engineering strategies
<br>
discussed by Mike &amp; Anders, there may be only certain
<br>
specific places in the galaxy where you can go, where
<br>
you may have the matter and energy resources that would
<br>
allow you to start the next S-curve of technological evolution.
<br>
JBrains &amp; MBrains *know* they don't want to get bigger.
<br>
They want to get &quot;smaller&quot;.  They will either know from
<br>
a theory of everything and/or having tried trillions of
<br>
possible designs that doing so is &quot;impossible&quot; or dedicate
<br>
the resources available in the most efficient way possible
<br>
to the exploration of the sub-atomic engineering phase space.
<br>
<p>For example, if as Frank points out, you can build reversible
<br>
computers that trump any non-reversible computer and you need
<br>
one of those to take the next steps in sub-atomic engineering
<br>
simulations *and* they require a saturn-mass of silicon to
<br>
do the engineering, then you are going to go to the location
<br>
where that much silicon is available for astroengineering.
<br>
You aren't going to run willy-nilly around your local region
<br>
of space terraforming every planet or JBraining &amp; MBraining
<br>
every star system because it isn't going to get you any
<br>
closer to having sub-atomic engineering capabilities or
<br>
knowing that they are not feasible.
<br>
<p>For Eugene's premises to be valid he has to make a strong
<br>
assertion that advanced technological civilizations do not
<br>
reach the conclusion that trying to ignore Malthus is doomed.
<br>
(Sooner or later you run out of stars or galaxies!)
<br>
Its assuming post-singularity technologies with pre-singularity
<br>
personal motivational systems and irrational thinking.
