&nbsp;&nbsp;Alright. Since the thread doesn't seem to be going away.
<br>
&nbsp;It's a statistical fact that the mean for persons who identify as
<br>
African-American on most (arguably virtually all) standardized
<br>
tests are aproximately one standard deviation below those
<br>
the mean of those who identify as white. Similarly East Asians
<br>
(Chinese, Koreans, Japanese) tend to do slightly better than white.
<br>
Everyone who has looked into this knows who is at the top of
<br>
the standardized test heap :) The reasons for this are factually
<br>
obscure. We don't know &quot;why&quot; this is so..but statistically it
<br>
is remarkably sure.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This &quot;discrepancy&quot; in test scores persists even after adjustment
<br>
for social status and parental income etc. Look at the mean
<br>
of middle class Black kids vs. mean middle class white kids.
<br>
Aproximately one standard deviation. Like clockwork.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are in the extremely high percentiles on tests like
<br>
the SATs or GREs or the like and are white it is unlikely affirmative
<br>
action will negatively affect their collegiate admissions opportunities.
<br>
Individuals who are marginal or borderline candidates for admissions
<br>
are the ones who are most affected by affirmative action. The number
<br>
of seats in a given class is limited. The ethnic admissions generally tend
<br>
to bump off marginal (white) candidates.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the record I got interested in this being a marginal candidate myself.
<br>
I had this awful (and well deserved GPA) during my first stint in college
<br>
and reality for grad schools being what it is...well regardless of test
<br>
scores
<br>
you need a certain GPA to get above the cutoffs for &quot;Secondary factors&quot;
<br>
(like essays, personability, neato life experience etc.) to be considered in
<br>
the admissions process.   It's a fact of life that there are spots on the
<br>
grad school classes that WILL be filled by candidates who are also marginal
<br>
(probably quite a bit more marginal than I am :) but who happen to have
<br>
a ethnicity card to play. I tend to view it as richly deserved rewards for
<br>
foolishness in my late teen years...but there are those who don't ace
<br>
standardized tests who have done everything right..and lost the brass ring
<br>
because they were edged out by an EO kid. Who will pass the bar at a lower
<br>
rate, who will likely hit lower quartiles on the Step 1 and 2, who will
<br>
rate lower in the Match etc. And as it happens honesty about performance
<br>
and merit goes the way of the dodo.  Granted it's great for the ethnics
<br>
who ARE star performers.. they are courted by all sides who wish to
<br>
demonstrate diversity (&quot; the cost of doing business&quot;). But the ethnics
<br>
who simply can't hit the performance standards just fall back down the
<br>
ladder....and place blame on the system. And then the blame game
<br>
and the cycle of hate starts all over.  And deep in the patchs of
<br>
hell that spot America deep troughs of dysfunctionality even
<br>
affirmative action can't begin to touch grow and fester. And sometimes
<br>
riot (like Cinncinnati recently). On the top of the heap though the
<br>
whites quietly practice segregation the american way...by lying.
<br>
You can walk the streets of Georgetown in DC and see a picture
<br>
perfect world, a rainbow of people hanging at Starbucks. But
<br>
it doesn't play well in Anacostia or the worst parts of Prince George
<br>
County. I don't even like to think about Cabrini-Green.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know what the answer is..but I think it starts with honesty.
<br>
and rigorous inquiry. Both of which can have my ass up in front
<br>
of the Old Lady for being a bigot, courtesy of the EO cohort.
<br>
Believe it!
