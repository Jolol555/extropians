<p>I got this from one of the SF newsgroups, posted by Jerry Pournelle 
<br>
<p>***begin quote*** 
<br>
<p><p>Following is a message which my one of my best friends passed along with
<br>
permission to distribute to those who might be interested. It fills in the
<br>
details that I missed in my original conversation with him and attempted to
<br>
relate to you. 
<br>
<p>Tom has given me permission to distribute the message - please feel free to
<br>
post it if you deem it appropriate. 
<br>
<p>Sincerely, 
<br>
<p>Art Russell Major, US Army (Retired)

<p>Today was a tragedy for all of America and to my family, a very personal
<br>
one.
<br>
Lynn and my Niece Liz's husband, Jeremy Glick was on United flight 93 this
<br>
morning. When the Hijackers took control of flight 93. Jeremy called my
<br>
niece
<br>
who in-turn conferenced him to 911. Jeremy relayed to the police what was
<br>
happening as the hijacking unfolded. As our niece Liz listened, Jeremy told
<br>
the
<br>
police there were three Arab terrorists with knives and a large red box that
<br>
they claimed contained a bomb. Jeremy tracked the second by second details
<br>
and
<br>
relayed them to the police by phone. After several minutes of describing the
<br>
scene, Jeremy and several other passengers decided there was nothing to lose
<br>
by
<br>
rushing the hijackers. Although United Flight 93 crashed outside of
<br>
Pittsburgh,
<br>
with the loss of all souls. Jeremy and the other patriotic heroes saved the
<br>
lives of many people on the ground that would have died if the Arab
<br>
terrorists
<br>
had been able to complete their heinous mission. 
<br>
<p>Please offer your prayers for all of those who perished or were injured in
<br>
this
<br>
tragic of all days and to our niece Liz Glick and her 2-month-old child,
<br>
Emerson, who are left without their loving Husband and Father. May we
<br>
remember
<br>
Jeremy and the other brave souls as heroes, soldiers and Americans' on
<br>
United
<br>
flight 93 whom so gallantry gave their lives to save many others. 
<br>
<p>Lynn, our four adult children and I are headed to New York to be with our
<br>
family during this time of great sadness 
<br>
<p>All of my best, 
<br>
<p>Tom
