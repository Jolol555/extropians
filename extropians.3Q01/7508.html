<p>I disagree, and on grounds that you should be familiar with: Ultra 
<br>
<p>Bletchley Park had to be very circumspect about how its decryption of
<br>
Enigma communications was used in battle, in some cases they had to
<br>
specifically let allied targets be attacked without warning. Similarly,
<br>
Nazi agents in Britain were turned into double agents in order to feed
<br>
bad data to the Nazis that enabled our eventual victory over the untruth
<br>
of Naziism.
<br>
<p>Similarly, we were able to use a lie, that Midway Island was running out
<br>
of water, to trick the Japanese into giving away what code names they
<br>
had assigned to it as a target leading up t to the battle of Midway.
<br>
<p>Lies can be used to further truth, if used circumspectly and properly.
<br>
They should not be used with impunity, though, else one side becomes
<br>
indistinguishable from the other.
