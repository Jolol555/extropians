<p><em>&gt; There *must* be hordes in Afganistan and other oppressed places
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would dance for joy if the Talibn is overthrown, like the munchkins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when Dorothy dropped the mortgage on the WW of the W.  For instance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what of all the Afgan gays?  They must be quietly terrified over there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waiting waiting waiting for *someone* to come along and end the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nightmare.  What about the women with some inkling of freedom?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about the intellects?  The nonreligious?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seems to me that the thing we do so very well today is information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; management.  There should be some way to use our information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handling skills to rip away the veil of ignorance and oppression.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just dont yet know how to get the message to them that there really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really are no houris waiting, that houris were invented by some cowardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cleric to convince the young men to lay down their lives for a political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause, while the clerics enjoy the *real* virgins at home in this life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do we break it to them?  spike
</em><br>
<p>Here's where *culture* is crucial.  There have been oppressed people
<br>
throughout history and before.  But the initiative to rebel effectively
<br>
against oppression seems to be deeply rooted in culture.  By contemporary
<br>
Western standards, in most places and times human females have been terribly
<br>
oppressed .  Why did it take until just yesterday by historical standards --
<br>
and only in the West -- for women to stand up and say &quot;we're mad as hell and
<br>
we're not going to take it anymore!&quot;?  I'm sure you know the old joke about
<br>
what women have half of and what they have all of, the point of which shows
<br>
all too clearly that huge numbers of people can be held in bondage to a
<br>
position of inferiority *if they believe that inferiority is their lot in
<br>
life*.
<br>
<p>It's a culture war.
