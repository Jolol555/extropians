<p>&lt;&lt; Huh? I believe in pattern identity theory and functionalism, but I don't
<br>
&nbsp;see any pattern as more or less valid than any other. What this thought
<br>
&nbsp;experiment was really about is how to tell whether the upload is
<br>
&nbsp;acceptable from the point of view of the person being uploaded. I'm not
<br>
&nbsp;getting into the issue of whether the upload is the original or not,
<br>
&nbsp;that is a completely separate issue with no real answer.  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>For me, if there is an original human personality, left behind, at the end of 
<br>
an upload process, it becomes unsatisfactory, since the subsequent persona, 
<br>
can be defined as merely, a clone. The original electron patterns that 
<br>
comprised the brain state are either conveyed to the network, or they are 
<br>
not. 
<br>
<p>This gives me pause to think of the experiments accomplished by Anton 
<br>
Zeilinger, and many others, regarding their Einstein Podolsky and Rosen 
<br>
experiments where entanglement becomes the means to the end. I wonder if this 
<br>
is a workable method, someday, to enable uploading to be workable?
<br>
<p>Getting back to the topic, we should seek to direct that the first uploads, 
<br>
at least, be sequential experiencers or continuers, rather then mere clones. 
<br>
Its better for our society, I believe, and more logical and appealing to most 
<br>
people. One reason for this is that the planet seems to small for many clones 
<br>
and their original, whereas the solar system or and interstellar journey, 
<br>
might be the best use of such clonnnings. I view uploads as &quot;viable&quot; only if 
<br>
they transfer a mind, or &quot;decant it&quot; as sci-fi writer Fred Pohl has offered 
<br>
up. The science, as we both see it, seems way beyond the current vector of 
<br>
technology.
