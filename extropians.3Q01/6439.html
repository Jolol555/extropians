I don't know if the links will come through on this, so here's the URL to
<br>
the entire story.

<p>&nbsp;For non-Americans, the Atlantic is a fairly left-leaning (by American
<br>
standards) journal.
<br>
<p><p>Coming to Grips with Jihad
<br>
<p>September 12, 2001
<br>
<p>&nbsp;s investigators attempt to trace yesterday's devastating terrorist acts to
<br>
their source, attention seems increasingly to be focusing on Osama bin Laden
<br>
and his militant followers-Islamic fundamentalists who consider themselves
<br>
engaged in a &quot;jihad&quot; (often translated as &quot;holy war&quot; but perhaps more
<br>
accurately rendered as &quot;righteous struggle&quot;) against the Western world. The
<br>
attacks on New York and Washington (if they are, indeed, the work of bin
<br>
Laden's men) represent the most audacious expression to date of
<br>
fundamentalist Islamic hatred for the West. But the jihad is not new. A
<br>
number of Atlantic articles from the early 1990s to the present have
<br>
considered the movement, addressing its origins and its consequences.
<br>
<p>In &quot;The Roots of Muslim Rage&quot; (September 1990), the historian of Islam
<br>
Bernard Lewis explored the reasons behind Islamic fundamentalists' antipathy
<br>
to the West. He contended that &quot;fundamentalist leaders are not mistaken in
<br>
seeing in Western civilization the greatest challenge to the way of life
<br>
that they wish to retain or restore for their people.&quot; Arguing that Islamic
<br>
fundamentalists are ultimately struggling against the dramatic changes
<br>
brought about by secularism and modernism, Lewis went on to write that
<br>
&quot;Islamic fundamentalism has given an aim and a form to the otherwise aimless
<br>
and formless resentment and anger of the Muslim masses at the forces that
<br>
have devalued their traditional values and, in the final analysis, robbed
<br>
them of their beliefs, their aspirations, their dignity, and to an
<br>
increasing extent even their livelihood.&quot; Lewis brought his piece to a close
<br>
with an admonition:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It should now be clear that we are facing a mood and a movement far
<br>
transcending the level of issues and policies and the governments that
<br>
pursue them. This is no less than a clash of civilizations-the perhaps
<br>
irrational but surely historic reaction of an ancient rival against our
<br>
Judeo-Christian heritage, our secular present, and the worldwide expansion
<br>
of both. It is crucially important that we on our side should not be
<br>
provoked into an equally historic but also equally irrational reaction
<br>
against that rival.... The movement nowadays called fundamentalism is not
<br>
the only Islamic tradition. There are others, more tolerant, more open, that
<br>
helped to inspire the great achievements of Islamic civilization in the
<br>
past, and we may hope that these other traditions will in time prevail.
<br>
In &quot;Blowback&quot; (May 1996), Mary Anne Weaver explained Osama bin Laden's rise
<br>
to power as an example of the manner in which the U.S. support for the
<br>
Afghan mujahideen-the loose coalition of fighters from all parts of the
<br>
Islamic world who doggedly resisted Soviet occupation during the 1980s-has
<br>
backfired on the United States. In essence, Weaver wrote, the CIA's training
<br>
of the mujahideen allowed for the creation and development of &quot;an informal
<br>
network of small, loosely organized underground cells, with support centers
<br>
scattered around the world: in the United States, the Persian Gulf
<br>
countries, Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavia, Sudan, Pakistan, and
<br>
Afghanistan.&quot; After describing the enduring relationships forged in this
<br>
network-between, among others, the Saudi Arabian bin Laden, the Afghan
<br>
leader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, the blind Egyptian cleric Sheikh Omar
<br>
Abdul-Rahman (convicted in 1996 of seditious conspiracy to wage a &quot;war of
<br>
urban terrorism against the United States&quot;), and the Palestinian Ramzi Ahmed
<br>
Youssef (considered to have been the mastermind of the 1993 terrorist attack
<br>
on the World Trade Center)- Weaver noted that such connections, the direct
<br>
result of U.S. intervention in Afghanistan more than a decade ago, have led
<br>
to the emergence of &quot;a new breed of terrorist&quot; whose energies are directed
<br>
against their former sponsors and trainers. The nature of terrorism has
<br>
changed, Weaver concluded-today, &quot;E-mail and faxes drive the jihad.&quot;
<br>
<p>More recently, Robert Kaplan visited the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and, in
<br>
&quot;The Lawless Frontier&quot; (September 2000), painted a disturbing picture of a
<br>
region dominated by tribalism, ignorance, violence, and rampant religious
<br>
fanaticism. The region's fundamentalist religious fervor crystallized in
<br>
1994 with the emergence of the Taliban, a militant group devoted to an
<br>
extremely inflexible version of Islam. In 1996, the Taliban seized control
<br>
of Afghanistan's government, and, as Kaplan observed during his April, 2000,
<br>
trip, it now continues to exert a powerful, destabilizing influence on the
<br>
border regions of Pakistan.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taliban embody a lethal combination: a primitive tribal creed, a
<br>
fierce religious ideology, and the sheer incompetence, naiveté, and cruelty
<br>
that are begot by isolation from the outside world and growing up amid war
<br>
without parents. They are also an example of globalization, influenced by
<br>
imported pan-Islamic ideologies and supported economically by both Osama bin
<br>
Laden's worldwide terrorist network (for whom they provide a base) and a
<br>
multibillion-dollar smuggling industry in which ships and trucks bring
<br>
consumer goods from the wealthy Arabian Gulf emirate of Dubai (less a state
<br>
than the world's largest shopping mall) through Iran and Afghanistan and on
<br>
to Quetta and Karachi.
<br>
In addition, we've included an Atlantic Unbound interview from August, 2000,
<br>
in which the Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid discussed his book, Taliban:
<br>
Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia, and shared insights
<br>
gained from his extraordinary access to Afghanistan and its radical Taliban
<br>
movement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the U.S. has a &quot;get Osama bin Laden policy&quot; but no effective Afghan
<br>
policy.... Afghanistan is now a major regional threat not just because the
<br>
Taliban are harboring Islamic extremists from more than twenty countries in
<br>
the Middle East, South Asia, and Central Asia but also because of the
<br>
proliferation of heroin exports, the sales of arms and other weapons, and
<br>
the cross-border smuggling which is destroying all the economies in the
<br>
region. Afghanistan is a black hole sucking in all its neighbors.
