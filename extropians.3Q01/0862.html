&quot;Crossing over&quot; to expose the tricks of
<br>
popular spirit mediums
<br>
<p>By Michael Shermer
<br>
<p>Like all other animals, we humans evolved to connect the dots between events
<br>
so as to discern patterns meaningful for our survival. Like no other animals,
<br>
we tell stories about the patterns we find. Sometimes the patterns are real;
<br>
sometimes they are illusions.
<br>
<p>A well-known illusion of a meaningful pattern is the alleged ability of
<br>
mediums to talk to the dead. The hottest medium today is former ballroom-dance
<br>
instructor John Edward, star of the cable television series Crossing Over and
<br>
author of the New York Times best-selling book One Last Time. His show is so
<br>
popular that he is about to be syndicated nationally on many broadcast
<br>
stations.
<br>
<p>How does Edward appear to talk to the dead? What he does seems
<br>
indistinguishable from tricks practiced by magicians. He starts by selecting a
<br>
section of the studio audience, saying something like &quot;I'm getting a George
<br>
over here. George could be someone who passed over, he could be someone here,
<br>
he could be someone you know,&quot; and so on. Of course, such generalizations lead
<br>
to a &quot;hit.&quot; Once he has targeted his subject, the &quot;reading&quot; begins, seemingly
<br>
using three techniques:
<br>
<p>1. Cold reading, in which he reads someone without initially knowing anything
<br>
about them. He throws out lots of questions and statements and sees what
<br>
sticks. &quot;I'm getting a 'P' name. Who is this, please?&quot; &quot;He's showing me
<br>
something red. What is this, please?&quot; And so on. Most statements are wrong. If
<br>
subjects have time, they visibly shake their heads &quot;no.&quot; But Edward is so fast
<br>
they usually have time to acknowledge only the hits. And as behaviorist B. F.
<br>
Skinner showed in his experiments on superstitious behavior, subjects need
<br>
only occasional reinforcement or reward to be convinced. In an expose I did
<br>
for WABC-TV in New York City, I counted about one statement a second in the
<br>
opening minute of Edward's show, as he riffled through names, dates, colors,
<br>
diseases, conditions, situations, relatives and the like. He goes from one to
<br>
the next so quickly you have to stop the tape and go back to catch them all.
<br>
<p>2. Warm reading, which exploits nearly universal principles of psychology.
<br>
Many grieving people wear a piece of jewelry that has a connection to a loved
<br>
one. Mediums know this and will say something like &quot;Do you have a ring or a
<br>
piece of jewelry on you, please?&quot; Edward is also facile at determining the
<br>
cause of death by focusing on either the chest or the head area and then
<br>
working rapid-fire through the half a dozen major causes of death. &quot;He's
<br>
telling me there was a pain in the chest.&quot; If he gets a positive nod, he
<br>
continues. &quot;Did he have cancer, please? Because I'm seeing a slow death here.&quot;
<br>
If the subject hesitates, Edward will immediately shift to heart attack.
<br>
<p>3. Hot reading, in which the medium obtains information ahead of time. One man
<br>
who got a reading on Edward's show reports that &quot;once in the studio, we had to
<br>
wait around for almost two hours before the show began. Throughout that time
<br>
everybody was talking about what dead relative of theirs might pop up.
<br>
Remember that all this occurred under microphones and with cameras already set
<br>
up.&quot;
<br>
<p>Whether or not Edward gathers information in this way, mediums generally
<br>
needn't. They are successful because they are dealing with the tragedy and
<br>
finality of death. Sooner or later we all will confront this inevitability,
<br>
and when we do, we may be at our most vulnerable.
<br>
<p>This is why mediums are unethical and dangerous: they prey on the emotions of
<br>
the grieving. As grief counselors know, death is best faced head-on as a part
<br>
of life. Pretending that the dead are gathering in a television studio in New
<br>
York to talk twaddle with a former ballroom-dance instructor is an insult to
<br>
the intelligence and humanity of the living.
