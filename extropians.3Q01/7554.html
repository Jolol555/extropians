<p>Either I've finally gotten on everybody's killfile, or my messages one this
<br>
topic have been too longwinded.
<br>
<p>The POINT is, we are not at war with a government. We are at war with
<br>
a transnational network of fanatics. This time, we are on the
<br>
centralized, top-heavy end of a conflict. This calls for new
<br>
strategies of warfare.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that a strategy worth trying is memetic warfare in
<br>
conjunction with economic aid. Give them some secular nonsense to
<br>
occupy their brains so there's less room for religious nonsense. Give
<br>
them something to lose and they won't be so in love with carnage.
<br>
<p>Call it moderation if you want. I've thought of a catchier name--
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Porkrinds, Porn, and Pilsner Campaign
<br>
<p>- --as in, the first things our bombers should airdrop over Towelstan.
<br>
Where reason and basic human decency fail, perhaps the adversary's
<br>
basic human greed and hedonism can still offer a ray of hope.
