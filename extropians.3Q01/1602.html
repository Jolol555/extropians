From: &quot;Lee Corbin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20capitalist%20religion&In-Reply-To=&lt;068201c1118a$2bf01d40$ed5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, I think that the rich can afford to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be much more irresponsible (at least for a while) than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the poor can.  When I was poor, I had, in order to escape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poverty, to be quite responsible in saving every dollar.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now that I'm no longer poor, it doesn't matter if I blow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hundred dollars on something.
</em><br>
<p>You're right, I hadn't thought of that angle. Of course it's the rich (more
<br>
than the poor) who get to define what's responsible. Economic responsibility
<br>
can enable one to become rich enough to scoff at responsibility of another
<br>
kind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is the difference between greed and self-interest?
</em><br>
<p>Self-interest recognizes the perils of greed better than greed understands
<br>
self-interest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll guess that we use the term &quot;greed&quot; to depict those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly self-interested individuals whose behavior goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond the confines of good taste and respectability;
</em><br>
<p>Greedy folks take more than is in their self-interest to take.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; e.g., the complete lack of charity and compassion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characterized the fictional Ebenezer Scrooge.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's a good example, I guess. Ebenezer let greed overtake his own
<br>
self-interest, which would have been better served by showing some concern for
<br>
people over money.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Self-interest, on the other hand, need have no such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative characteristics.
</em><br>
<p>That's how I see it too. Greed is not in one's best self-interest.
<br>
<p>Glad we got that squared away.
<br>
<p>BTW, the subject line &quot;capitalist religion&quot; seems like a self-contradiction to
<br>
me, because no one invented capitalism (unlike religion), it's the natural
<br>
order of things.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
