</em><br>
<p>This report bothers me on a couple of other points not mentioned directly in
<br>
the article.
<br>
<p>Firstly, a farmer is being sued because he only planted some of his fields
<br>
with GM crops.  The company refuses to believe it and wants to punish him
<br>
unless he uses 100% GM crops.  This directly contradicts the plans of using
<br>
fractional planting to avoid breeding resistant pests.  To avoid breeding
<br>
resistant pests, farmers use some percentage of non-GM crops to allow some
<br>
non-resistant pests to survive into the next generation.  This move by
<br>
Monsanto worsens the problem of resistant pests and prevents farmers from
<br>
trying to avoid the problem.
<br>
<p>Secondly, a farmer was sued for using GM crops even though he never planted
<br>
them.  The cross-pollination from nearby farms converted his crops to GM
<br>
crops according to Monsanto.  This directly contradicts claims that GM crops
<br>
can be controlled and won't escape or interfere with farmers who don't want
<br>
GM crops.  If GM crops (and their related legal patents) convert nearby
<br>
natural crops into GM crops, this implies that the Monsanto patent will
<br>
spread wider and wider until everybody has their genetic modifications
<br>
whether they want them or not.  Despite our best efforts, the modifications
<br>
are being released in the wild, and it is taking over so-called natural
<br>
farms.
<br>
<p>These two points seem to contradict the claims by Monsanto that methods can
<br>
be used to prevent the breeding of resistant pests and to prevent the
<br>
uncontrolled spreading of their genes into the wild.  Like the
<br>
cross-contamination of GM corn products into other products that weren't
<br>
supposed to contain any of the GM corn, these examples further demonstrate
<br>
that we cannot control the technology.  Although the science is sound, and
<br>
the benefits are clear, the infrastructure is not capable of controlling
<br>
these inventions.  It appears that they can't be kept out of food if
<br>
desired, they can't be kept out of the wild if desired, and they can't be
<br>
used in a manner that won't breed resistant pests.
<br>
<p>Although there is no scientific reason why this must be so, it appears that
<br>
some of the fears about GM foods are actually coming true.
