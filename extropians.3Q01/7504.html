<p>Blah blah. By the same logic, we should have been moderate with Japan,
<br>
since they claimed they were only 'defending' themselves against the
<br>
trade embargo we had imposed on them prior to Dec 7th, and we should
<br>
have been 'moderate' with the Nazis, since they claimed that they were
<br>
only regaining territory that had been taken from them unjustly in the
<br>
Versailles treaty, and were, according to them, dealing with 'criminal'
<br>
elements (jews and communists) that had contributed to Germany's defeat.
<br>
<p>See what happens to open minded people? Their brains fall out.
<br>
<p>Just because someone showers you with their counterclaims that they say
<br>
justifies their hatred of us doesn't mean you have to listen to them, or
<br>
that they are in any way right. No nation is innocent. You can always
<br>
come up with a laundry list of offenses that one nation has committed
<br>
against another to justify any action you wish to take.
