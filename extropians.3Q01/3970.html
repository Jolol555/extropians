Scientists hope to raise the neural curtain on sleep's virtual theater
<br>
Bruce Bower
<br>
<p>After his father's death in 1896, Viennese neurologist Sigmund Freud made a
<br>
momentous career change. He decided to study the mind instead of the brain.
<br>
Freud began by probing his own mind. Intrigued by his conflicted feelings
<br>
toward his late father, the scientist analyzed his own dreams, slips of the
<br>
tongue, childhood memories, and episodes of forgetfulness.
<br>
<p>Freud's efforts culminated in the 1900 publication of The Interpretation of
<br>
Dreams. In that book, he depicted dreams as symbolic stories in which
<br>
sleepers' unconscious sexual and aggressive desires play out in disguised
<br>
forms.
<br>
<p>Later in his life, Freud acknowledged that dreams don't always gratify wishes.
<br>
For instance, he noted that some dreams represent attempts to master a past
<br>
traumatic experience. Yet the father of psychoanalysis always held that dreams
<br>
contain both surface events and subterranean themes of great personal
<br>
importance. For that reason, he wrote, &quot;the interpretation of dreams is the
<br>
royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind.&quot;
<br>
<p>Freud's theory of how dreams work has had a huge cultural impact over the past
<br>
century, even as it attracted intense criticism. Now, brain scientists-members
<br>
of the discipline that Freud left behind-have stepped to the forefront of this
<br>
passionate dream dispute.
<br>
<p>One prominent group of scientists asserts that Freud profoundly misunderstood
<br>
dreams. In their view, the act of dreaming yields a guileless collage of
<br>
strange but heartfelt images that carry no hidden meanings.
<br>
<p>These scientists say that dreaming occurs when a primitive structure called
<br>
the brain stem stirs up strong emotions, especially anxiety, elation, and
<br>
anger. At the same time, neural gateways to the external world shut down, as
<br>
do centers of memory and rational thought. The brain then creates bizarre,
<br>
internal visions that strongly resonate for the dreamer.
<br>
<p>An opposing view corresponds in many ways to Freud's ideas. Its supporters
<br>
portray dreams as products of a complex frontal-brain system that seeks out
<br>
objects of intense interest or desire. When provoked during sleep, this brain
<br>
system depicts deep-seated goals in veiled ways so as not to rouse the
<br>
dreamer.
<br>
<p>A third group of investigators regards the brain data as intriguing but
<br>
inconclusive. Dreams may serve any of a variety of functions, they argue.
<br>
Depending on the society, these uses include simulating potential threats,
<br>
grappling with personal and community problems, sparking artistic creativity,
<br>
and diagnosing and healing physical illnesses.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is striking that 100 years after Freud [published The Interpretation of
<br>
Dreams], there is absolutely no agreement as to the nature of, function of, or
<br>
brain mechanism underlying dreaming,&quot; says neuroscientist Robert Stickgold of
<br>
Harvard Medical School in Boston.
<br>
<p>A broad consensus exists on one point, though. If neuroscientists hope to
<br>
understand the vexing relationship of brain and mind, they need to get a
<br>
handle on dreams.
<br>
<p>Dreams as an afterthought
<br>
<p>Freud's royal road to the unconscious looks like a scientific dead-end to
<br>
psychiatrist J. Allan Hobson. Neuroscientific evidence indicates that the
<br>
sleeping brain churns out dreams as an afterthought to its other duties, argue
<br>
Hobson, Stickgold, and Edward F. Pace-Schott, also of Harvard Medical School.
<br>
<p>&quot;Unconscious wishes play little or no part in dream instigation, dream emotion
<br>
is uncensored and undisguised, sleep is not protected by dreaming, and dream
<br>
interpretation has no scientific status,&quot; Hobson says.
<br>
<p>Hobson's assault on Freudian dream theory began more than a decade ago. At
<br>
that time, he proposed that dreams result from random bursts of activity in a
<br>
brain stem area that regulates breathing and other basic bodily functions.
<br>
These brain stem blasts zip to the frontal brain during periods of rapid eye
<br>
movement (REM) sleep, when the entire brain becomes nearly as active as when a
<br>
person is awake.
<br>
<p>Dreams most often occur during REM sleep. A slumbering individual enters REM
<br>
sleep about every 90 minutes.
<br>
<p>Hobson's group published a revision of this theory in the December 2000
<br>
Behavioral and Brain Sciences. Their new approach grants that dreams harbor
<br>
emotional significance, but not in the way Freud posited.
<br>
<p>Brain imaging and sleep-laboratory data clearly delineate among wakefulness,
<br>
REM sleep, and non-REM sleep, the Harvard scientists note.
<br>
<p>Three essential processes during REM sleep make it the prime time for
<br>
dreaming, they say. First, brain stem activity surges and sets off responses
<br>
in emotional and visual parts of the brain. Second, brain regions that handle
<br>
sensations from the outside world, control movement, and carry out logical
<br>
analysis shut down. Third, brain stem cells pump out acetylcholine, a chemical
<br>
messenger that jacks up activity in emotional centers.
<br>
<p>At the same time, two neurotransmitters essential for waking
<br>
activity-noradrenaline and serotonin-take a snooze.
<br>
<p>The result, in Hobson's view: a vivid hallucination, informed by strong
<br>
emotions, that takes bizarre twists and turns. REM sleep's biological makeup
<br>
fosters the mistaken belief that one is awake while dreaming, saps the ability
<br>
to reflect on the weirdness of dreams as they occur, and makes it difficult to
<br>
recall dreams after waking up.
<br>
<p>REM sleep conducts far more important business than dreaming, Hobson argues.
<br>
Its central functions may include supporting brain development, regulating
<br>
body temperature, fortifying the immune system, and fostering memories of
<br>
recently learned information. The last possibility evokes heated scientific
<br>
debate
