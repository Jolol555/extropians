<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;My point here is why doesnt everyone get the legislated minimum?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I make more then minimum wage and theres a reason. Supply and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;demand dictate this stuff, not government OR buisnesses OR unions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point was that before Unions came along everybody DID make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimum, and it was a much smaller minimum.
</em><br>
<p>No, not everybody made the minimum. The unskilled made the minimum.
<br>
Those with skills were sought after, and the unskilled only made the
<br>
minimum in areas where immigration had created labor surpluses. In most
<br>
of the country in the 19th century, for instance, there was a labor
<br>
shortage. Only in areas like Chicago and New York and other industrial
<br>
centers like Pittsburg, etc with high immigrant populations was there
<br>
such a labor surplus that a person could not live on an unskilled wage.
<br>
<p>This was exacerbated by the lack of transportation. Unless you lived
<br>
within walking distance of your place of employment, you needed to make
<br>
enough extra to pay for rail transportation to and from work each day.
<br>
Trolley's helped, but the end of the line still kept you a prisoner of
<br>
the local labor market. It wasn't until the advent of popular automobile
<br>
ownership arose that this problem of local labor imbalances evened out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This boils down to.. did the Unions distort the market. If they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;did, they created inefficiencies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What they did was create workers rights, which didn't exist before.
</em><br>
<p>They did exist before, but were treated as contractual issues in the
<br>
guild system. Industrialization broke this system down somewhat, and it
<br>
is evident that this early industrialization period was the true start
<br>
of the shift of the US from a libertarian free market to a more
<br>
mercantilist system of business colluding with government.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Worth $6 to whom? The company? Why are you worth more then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;everyone else? My supposition was the normal wage for a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;job was $3. Why cant I come in and offer to do the same job as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;union guys at a lower price?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the record I'm always worth alot more than I'm paid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because the Union guys have agreed to work only with other union
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guys.
</em><br>
<p>A reestablishment of the guild system, of course. 
<br>
<p>I have a personal ax to grind with unions though. When I left the US Air
<br>
Force, Boeing had dropped their job offer to me, and the IBEW refused to
<br>
recognise ANY of my military training as an aircraft electrician. They
<br>
demanded that I go through their two year apprenticeship school and
<br>
three years more after that working for $7 an hour (in Seattle) with no
<br>
advancement whatsoever from my military experience. I told them to stuff
<br>
it. I figured that if that was how unions 'protected' workers, they were
<br>
frauds. All they are is seniority protectionist rackets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Like someone else said in their post, the unions can bitch and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;whine all they want. End the end, Mexico will get the jobs and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;those union saps will be out of work. Thell learn they cant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;control market forces long without paying the piper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My job isn't going to Mexico Jerry, and never will.
</em><br>
<p>That's beacause you are a skilled laborer, Brian. However, don't be too
<br>
surprised to be replaced some time in the future with mexican temporary
<br>
workers.
