Barbara Lamar asks
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What meaning do people on this list give to the term &quot;capitalism&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>and she provides the handy dictionary definition
<br>
<p>&quot;an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital
<br>
goods, by investments that are determined by private decision rather than by
<br>
state control, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that
<br>
are determined mainly by competition in a free market.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I'll say that capitalism is the economic system that naturally
<br>
arises from the existence of free markets---and from liberty
<br>
itself, where also people are not prevented by their government
<br>
from accumulating capital goods (to almost any degree).  But
<br>
I'll admit to being ignorant as to why corporations require the
<br>
freedom from legal liability (someone else posed this question
<br>
earlier).  That such freedom may be necessary strikes me as
<br>
possible, given the historic economic boom in industrialized
<br>
countries following the creation of corporations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The [above] definition is not very useful without definitions for &quot;private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision&quot; and &quot;state control.&quot;  Clearly, this definition assumes that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practice of capitalism is consistent within the jurisdiction of a political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state, since the definition includes ownership of capital goods by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations, which are creations of the state.
</em><br>
<p>The essential difference between private control and state
<br>
control consists in the use of force.  The state may pass
<br>
laws (making it illegal, say, for you to offer mail service,
<br>
or to buy gasoline where it's cheap and sell it where it's
<br>
expensive, or to offer your embryos or children for sale).
<br>
<p>Private control can also issue decrees, &quot;no smoking&quot;, &quot;cut
<br>
your hair just so&quot;, or &quot;don't engage in scandalous behavior
<br>
even outside work&quot;, &quot;believe in God or else&quot;---but you *don't*
<br>
have to work there.  But if I break a government rule, I will
<br>
be punished (and even killed if I resist), unless I manage
<br>
to flee the entire country (into a worse situation, as happens
<br>
to be the case---though Keith Henson wouldn't agree).
