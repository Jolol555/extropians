I'm reading this book &quot;Future Noir: The making of Blade Runner&quot;. I just got 
<br>
to page 85, and it was talking about how Dustin Hoffman was originally 
<br>
considered for the role of Deckard. It goes off on a tangent for a paragraph 
<br>
and says this:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;'Hoffman was involved for a couple of months,' Fancher continues. 'But 
<br>
during that time I started seeing parts of the story veering into what I 
<br>
thought were overly familiar areas. Dustin was enamoured of cryogenics 
<br>
[SIC], for example. He began talking about how freezing people with deadly 
<br>
diseases before they died and then being able to successfully thaw them out 
<br>
was really going to happen someday. He was a big fan of that. [Blade Runner 
<br>
director Scott] Ridley got off on the idea, too.'&quot;
<br>
<p>So I'm wondering, is he signed up for it? Should he be? Anyone else have any 
<br>
quotes from him?

<p>&quot;What is this, some Three Stooges episode where everyone is armed with pies? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill Gates is supposed to walk through the airport with an armful of pies 
<br>
so that he can stoop to the level of his attackers?&quot; -Chris Russo
