</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Giving no brain examples that have nothing at all to do with the

<em>&gt; &gt; spiritual believes strikes me as a dishonest (intentionally or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not) tactic.  It belittles by the implication that spirituality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is equally as odious through and through as morons who think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; walking on the moon was faked.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha, J.R. and I were trying to describe each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separate category of religious attitude separately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when we wrote some of the things we did.  This was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in reference to people that you might consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious fundamentalists.  Please don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that it is implied that what is true of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some religious people is necessarily true of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all religious people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose that I have a computer program that gives what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; think is a 99.9% chance of being a wrong answer.  I simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; MUST entertain the hypothesis that there is something wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; with the program.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Another poor and off-topic analogy that obscures far more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it clarifies.  Why not just say you don't want to engage this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; question further?  Because you sure aren't really engaging it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with this type of response.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True!  I just don't have time, really.  I really do intend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to continue the discussion of spirituality and so forth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; There comes a point in disagreeing with people who seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; reality challenged that one cannot be blamed for inquiring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; as to why they are so bad at understanding the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is precisely because I am not reality challenged that I must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consider spirituality and in some ways embrace it.  Reality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; including those aspects most consider spiritual, has butted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; heads with me a few times to many to do otherwise.   Do you take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into account that I just might be just as deeply honest and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; every bit as much integrity as you do despite the fact I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some things differently than you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course you do!   This has just been a terrible miscommunication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evidently in our efforts at rather Aristotelian classification of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all people who claim religious beliefs---and hence our effort to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be as correct as possible---we, or at least I was having difficulty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about, as evolved in the discussion J.R. and I were having,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the case of people who, say, belief everything in the bible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>But you have not classified all people who claim religious
<br>
beliefs.  At one end you have turned spirituality into humanist
<br>
generalities that don't grasp the essence of the matter, at the
<br>
other end you have spoken a lot about utter cretins who happen
<br>
to be religious.  The middle was waved at by suggesting people
<br>
there were &quot;just being fashionable&quot;. (?!) The people on this
<br>
list and in the general world who are in no such categories were
<br>
never cataloged at all.  Not only that but their very existence
<br>
was called into question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If I am mistaken you have given me no grounds for seeing that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; am here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, exactly so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If anything you seem to be clinging harder to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; position that those who affirm some parts of religion or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spirituality are damaged in their thinking processes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My claim is vastly broader than that.  Anyone who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently reality challenged---again not anyone on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list---I simply begin at some point to wonder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is wrong or damaged in their ability to think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Your claim is broader than stating that anyone who affirms any
<br>
part of religion/spirituality is damaged in their thinking
<br>
processes? (!?)
<br>
<p>Since a large part of this conversation is hopefully engaging
<br>
people on this list who do have some use for spirituality I
<br>
don't see how comments supposedly about the subject that aren't
<br>
applicable to those you are in conversation with can not be seen
<br>
as either portraying a very negative view of all spirituality
<br>
including that exhibited by people on list or of pulling on only
<br>
extremes to make a point and again not engaging the subject or
<br>
the people here.   
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You also seem to have some difficulty seeing (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; admitting anyway) that this position is a tad extreme.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My examples were a tad extreme, because I was trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be comprehensive, that's all.
</em><br>
<p><p>Huh?  You can't be comprehensive by only giving examples from
<br>
one extreme end of the spectrum or by defining out of existences
<br>
people who don't fit your preferred categorization.
