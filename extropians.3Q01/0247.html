<em>&gt;I would not call such a contract robust. By way of comparison, if you

</em><br>
<p>A one-shot simultanious thing-for-cash exchange does not require a contract at all. We either agree and exchange, or don't.
<br>
<p>If things just get slightly more difficult we need a contract to cover the responsabilities. What should the interest be if I'm late with payment. Is it OK to do partial delivery, etc.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;You can't enforce a copyright without relying on a huge, global
</em><br>
<em>&gt;network of bureaucrats, politicians, and lawyers.
</em><br>
<p>That's true of any contract. How do you enforce me to pay back a loan to you?
<br>
<p><p>Alex F. Bokov:
<br>
<em>&gt;By the way, what if I take Symphony #5 by Felix, add some movements
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and call it Symphony #5 by Felix and Alex. Or even Symphony #5 by
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Samantha Atkins
<br>
<em>&gt;But there are huge questions in there of exactly what &quot;my&quot;

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>If it's a derivative work, you'll need my permission. Admittedly, it's sometimes tricky to determince wheter it's a derivative work or not. It's an sliding scale, it depends on the amount of information, or rather complexity of the work involved.
<br>
<p><p>Alex F. Bokov again:
<br>
<em>&gt;Certainly. I'd respect inherently *uncopyable* software far more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;software that somebody else's ethics or laws presume to restrict me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from copying.
</em><br>
<p>Do you have an online bank account? If it's possible to break in to that, would it be ethical? Should it be legal?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;That said, I will believe it when I see it. Users can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capture streaming content; they can use debuggers and disassemblers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crack any password or serial number; they can then use p2p networks or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anonymous online space to share the 'liberated' software.
</em><br>
<p>Yes I agree, there will always be harmful petty &quot;thievs&quot; thinkering with such things for fun. Then there are &quot;commercial&quot; pirates that duplicates anything that sell.
