<em>&gt; Just as today there are businesses that find an increasingly lucrative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market among women, immigrants, people of color, and gays. Now they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cater to traditionally oppressed groups not in some selfless do-gooder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crusade but simply because their money is as green as anybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else's. Everywhere and everyplace there are always merchants shrewd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to go after that money if governments don't interfere (with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws like the ones banning women from voting, banning gays from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marrying or enlisting in the regional security monopoly, aparteid,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This only happens in a political and legal environment where
<br>
going after these dollars is allowed and where the hatred and
<br>
animosity against these out groups is no so high that the
<br>
business believe they will lose more than the dollar gained. 
<br>
Good business is certainly not a cure-all.  Business alone did
<br>
not break open the civil rights abuses of the 60s nor did it
<br>
bring greater rights to women, gays and other groups.   Business
<br>
cashes in after the tide has begun to turn.  It seldom
<br>
instigates greater acceptance of out groups directly in
<br>
opposition to the surrounding climate.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The corollary of this is that if you want to advance the cause of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever group you belong to, the key is to become an economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force to be reckoned with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Jim Crow era was really a fight between the liberal Federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government and certain reactionary state governments. While it does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cast doubt on the Republican &quot;State's Rights&quot; doctrine it only lends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support to anarcho-libertarianism, because if there weren't any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments passing irrational laws in the first place, intervention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from an even higher level of government would not have been necessary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So.  Do you assume that people all by themselves do not nurse
<br>
and propagate vicious memes against groups they perceive as
<br>
different enough and/or a threat? 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Libertarians don't favor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; outlawing stupidity, but stupidity should have its costs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It does, by definition, except when some do-gooder authority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decides to redistribute these costs and protect the stupid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the consequences of their actions.
</em><br>
<p>The goal (wrongly implemented and executed as the means often
<br>
are) is to protect the victims of the nastiness and end as much
<br>
of the nastiness as possible.
