The rules of physics and nature of reality change all the time. Does
<br>
matter obey rules, as in obedience? What functionality is there to cause
<br>
that? What is inherent in any physical thing which causes it to do what
<br>
it is supposed to do? This view is one of both faith and authority. It
<br>
is faith in physical laws, that they are true, and belief in the
<br>
authority of those laws as if the universe is ruled by them.
<br>
<p>An alternative model is one of logical probabilities. For anything we
<br>
know, there exists the chance we will be wrong, however minute that
<br>
chance is. Certainty then is a special class of probability. Depending
<br>
on context we may allow 95% certainty to stand for certainty. Maybe the
<br>
situation demands 99.95%. Fuzzy logic scenarios may only demand 40% or
<br>
less.
<br>
<p>We do not have laws. We have observations which have been meticulously
<br>
written down. There is no guarantee anything will emulate past
<br>
observation. Al we can do is say it probably will.

<em>&gt;I imagine you are more than intelligent enough to know this is a

<em>&gt;&gt; Why do you say the nonrealist position is subjective? That doesn't make

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; result, that it be &quot;real&quot;. Seems to me realism is much more subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and you have it backwards.
