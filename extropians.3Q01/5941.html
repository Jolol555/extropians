Well, its finally happened, though perhaps fortunately on a show
<br>
that not many average people watch.  The central feature of the
<br>
Stargate episode tonight (Nemesis) was the grey goo scenario.
<br>
The TV Guide listing doesn't seem to match the Showtime listing
<br>
of &quot;current&quot; shows, so it is probably a repeat.
<br>
<p>Spoilers may follow....
<br>
<p>Plot summary -- Asgaard ship (the good guys from a foreign
<br>
galaxy who have preveiously assisted the Earthlings in dealing
<br>
with the evil species running around our galaxy) shows up above
<br>
Earth and beams up Captian O'Neill who finds out he is now on
<br>
a ship with a dying alien and an infestation of &quot;replicators&quot;
<br>
(roughly 6-inch mechanical spiders).  The Asgaard galaxy is
<br>
apparently being overrun by them, due to their thought that
<br>
their technology was better than anything they might bring
<br>
back on their ships for study.
<br>
<p>The &quot;replicators&quot; are slowly eating the ship and will
<br>
decend upon the Earth once there are enough of them.
<br>
Plans are developed to cause a failure during reentry
<br>
to melt the ship and with it the nasty swarm.  Problems are
<br>
encountered, fights between the SG1 team and the &quot;replicators&quot;
<br>
ensue.  But as fast as you blast one of the little spiders
<br>
to bits, they reassemble themselves.  The SG1 team manages
<br>
to escape through the ship's stargate (maybe) but one
<br>
of the &quot;replicators&quot; manages to survive the uncontrolled
<br>
reentry.  (To be continued).
<br>
<p>Even I, as much as I like nanotech, found myself being
<br>
a little worried about the problems it seemed to raise.
<br>
It points out however, a potential flaw in the friendly
<br>
AI scenario.  Even if humans become this nice benevolent
<br>
race, cared for by this friendly SysOp who make sure that
<br>
nobody within the system can do harmful things to the system,
<br>
that doesn't prevent someone from outside the system from
<br>
inventing the mindless entity that has no moral system
<br>
and whose sole purpose of being is to &quot;replicate&quot;.
<br>
The most telling point the alien made was that they had
<br>
never found the inventors of the &quot;replicators&quot;, presumably
<br>
because they themselves had been consumed.
<br>
<p>Does a relatively endless supply of creative mistakes doom
<br>
selected and evolved intelligence?
<br>
<p>Robert
