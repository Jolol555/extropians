<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm, do you mean that since some philosophers thought comprehension of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; eudaimonia was not possible for the many and the singularity is also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; incomprehensible, there is a link? That sounds rather far-fetched.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Really? What exactly do you find far-fetched? It seems to me that in both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cases there is said to be an epistemic gap between (t least some) humans and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those that are more godlike in their wisdom. If this epistemic similarity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not sufficient to constitute a link reflect on the fact that it seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; raise the same sorts of ethical and political consequences. If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; postsingularity beings are wiser than us then they may have a better idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what are eudaimonia consists in than we do; which is analogous to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; position Plato attributes to the philosopher-king as compared with the hoi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; polloi. Plato thought the philosopher-kings and the guardians would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; justified in bringing the many into line by force and deceit. Will the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; postsingularity beings be similarly justified?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you are mixing up the concept of the singularity with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putative properties of posthumans. Using this way of reasoning christian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theology is clearly linked to eudaimonism, since God ought to be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good at understanding eudaimonia. What Waldemar was originally pointing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out is that the singularity concept in our discourse tends to draw undue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention to highly hypothetical futures which are also implied to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unknowable and quite often appear static, and asking whether this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't limit our eudaimonic striving.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>There is nothing necessarily &quot;Christian&quot; about such
<br>
speculations.  Aristotle and Plato were certainly not
<br>
Christian.  Nor are such ideas foreign to many cultural
<br>
institutions, religious and secular.  The fundamental question
<br>
doesn't seem so unreasonable.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I agree with Charles that the idea of philosopher kings being justified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in using force to bring about their ideas is largely discredited. At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least I do not wish to support such behavior, neither of philosophers or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posthumans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What will you recommend when those who will oppose the very
<br>
existence of any trans/post-humans take up force to stop such
<br>
coming about?  Assuming adroit side-stepping of such blockage,
<br>
what will be your post-attitude toward various factions of
<br>
current level humans attempting endlessly to wipe each other out
<br>
largely from little more than some errors in their thinking
<br>
based in limited understanding, training, biology and so on? 
<br>
Will you sit and let them kill each other utterly?  Or might
<br>
you, given the power, back all of them up continuously with DNA
<br>
samples so that they can have another go until they grow up a
<br>
bit?  Or perhaps slap them in a Matrix like arrangement designed
<br>
for their eventual (at their own pace - no force) evolution into
<br>
more enlightened beings?  
<br>
<p>Honestly, what would you consider the most moral and ethical
<br>
course and why?
