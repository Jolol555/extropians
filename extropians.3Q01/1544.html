These discussions are far to simplistic.  They discuss
<br>
capitalism and economics in terms of the way the world was at
<br>
the time of Atlas Shrugged.  They do not account for a
<br>
technological abundance that will go off the scale as we near
<br>
singularity, nor for the real riches switching to an almost
<br>
infinitely divisible medium (information), nor for more and more
<br>
classes of people becoming economically superfluous as
<br>
technology advances.   They also do not account for the
<br>
potential of technology both for a level of liberation from
<br>
scarcity (which traditional economics is based on) on the one
<br>
hand, and for a system of totalitarian control by the few that
<br>
makes all previous attempts look like a free society in
<br>
comparison on the other.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; However, the real reason that I oppose government confiscation

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Seems as likely to me that government confiscates the meager wealth of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whose lives haven't worked out for some reason, and uses it to finance the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; needs of the prudent (who have managed to figure out how to gain access to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dollars, viz., politicians).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That depends on what you mean by prudent.  If stealing is prudent, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful thieves should be seen as exemplars of that virtue.  Of course,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you judge people by how well they get along in each system, then certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; types of people do well in a welfare state -- not necessarily the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who would do well under either a free market or full socialism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You should also ask what it is that taxation and redistribution achieves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimately -- e.g., what sort of changes it makes in society.  More people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will devote their efforts to trying to get at unearned wealth and less to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other, more productive activities.  (Before it can be taxed, wealth must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produced.  The more taxes there are, the less reason there is for many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to produce.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would also point out, this class of tax takers includes not only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politicians, but, in general, those who chase after government money or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favors.  I recall in the 1990s, the Cato Institute <a href="http://www.cato.org/">http://www.cato.org/</a> came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out with a report on corporate welfare in the US, finding that this was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huge part of the Federal budget.  (I.e., reducing it, would reduce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overall budget -- and the money saved could be given back to the taxpayers.)
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Cheers!
