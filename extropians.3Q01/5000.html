<p><em>&gt; Actually, the immigration of all those Mexican peasants does indeed matter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to us all, especially those of us who are planning to be frozen if old age 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ain't cured pretty soon.  The substantial MAJORITY of immigrants, Mexicans or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise, are &quot;peasants.&quot;  From my observations, peasants don't run much of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a country. Mainly, they live in kleptocracies. I don't want the USA to be a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kleptocracy. I doubt cryonics would be legal for the common man in the USA 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were uneducated peasants to abound in the USA.
</em><br>
<p>Everything hinges on the rate of cultural uptake.  My own ancestors came
<br>
from a variety of European countries most of which had no clue concerning
<br>
traditions of liberty.  Sometimes I suspect that the decline in the 
<br>
respect for those traditions may have been the fault of a number of
<br>
nineteenth century immigrants who tried, but who just didn't &quot;get it&quot;.
<br>
Then when opportunities to socialize a great many things in the 20th
<br>
century arose, they and their descendents embraced these &quot;naturally
<br>
appealing&quot; programs.
<br>
<p>Mexican culture (as is most of Latin American culture) deeply authoritarian,
<br>
militaristic, and corrupt.  Although the infusion of large numbers of 
<br>
people from such a culture is dangerous, it by no means renders the situation
<br>
hopeless.  New circumstances and new opportunites can have a great effect
<br>
on people, and isn't it commonly conceded that Mexicans in the U.S. are
<br>
hard-working and productive?  (Of course, I do *not* mean universally so---
<br>
no group is.)  This defies the stereotype of tropical nations (which,
<br>
due to geographical determinism has some truth to it, naturally).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another thing, most of the mexican immigrants are indians, and they are the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uneducated peasants who get the grunt work that would be going to US 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens otherwise.  I am part indian, so therefore by the current calculus 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of racial political correctness, I get to criticise them.
</em><br>
<p>Um..., I'm not sure about whether or not you get to criticize them.
<br>
Being Indian---oops, I mean Native American---may qualify you for
<br>
affirmative action or preferences, but I don't think that you get
<br>
to criticize your own group;  quite the opposite.  A number of
<br>
people came out of the racism thread still maintaining that it
<br>
was just as possible for black people to be racist against blacks
<br>
as it was for white people.  Recall the incomparable venom directed
<br>
against Judge Clarence Thomas, Thomas Sowell, and all the other
<br>
Uncle Toms who don't follow the party line on race or ethnicity.
