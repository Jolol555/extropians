The risk of skin cancer, the causes of global warming, the dangers of high
<br>
cholesterol - one expert says it's all bunk. Report by Robin McKie
<br>
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4213851,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4213851,00.html</a>

Sunday July 1, 2001
<br>
<p>Imagine a world where cholesterol is harmless, depression is beneficial and
<br>
only suntan lotions cause skin cancer. Or a planet on which the industrial
<br>
gases that pour from cars and factories are unconnected with increasing
<br>
temperatures and rising ocean levels... it may be far closer to reality than
<br>
we realise.
<br>
<p>Many of the medical and environmental horror stories that fill our newspapers
<br>
and TV documentaries on subjects ranging from global warming to GM foods may
<br>
be based on science that is 'so unreliable, so fragile, that it does not merit
<br>
our emotional energy', according to a controversial new analysis of science in
<br>
the modern world.
<br>
<p>In Fragile Science: The Reality Behind the Headlines, Dr Robin Baker, argues
<br>
that confusion over statistical analyses, pressure to provide speedy answers,
<br>
misguided belief in computer models and the desire to attract the attention of
<br>
journalists and broadcasters have misled the public to such a degree that 'we
<br>
can scarcely believe anything they tell us'.
<br>
<p>As a result, the public has been pressured into believing that
<br>
cholesterol-reducing diets will save their lives, that global warming is
<br>
mankind's fault, and that GM foods are threats to global well-being - although
<br>
evidence to back any of these claims is either absent or unconvincing.
<br>
<p>It is a damning indictment of pop-science. But is Baker - whose previous book,
<br>
Sperm Wars, was an international bestseller - correct?
<br>
<p>A good example of Baker's analysis is provided by skin cancer. Over the past
<br>
three decades, cases of malignant melanomas have soared and irrefutable
<br>
evidence has been gathered to show exposure to sunlight is a principal cause.
<br>
Making sure people block out such rays has therefore become a priority among
<br>
health education experts, with sun creams highlighted as key preventive
<br>
measures.
<br>
<p>But Baker says the evidence to back their efficacy is meagre and
<br>
contradictory. Some studies, on both humans and mice, have found that
<br>
sunscreens can increase the chances of getting skin cancer. As he points out,
<br>
plastering your body with chemicals is a risky business.
<br>
<p>'There are just as many grounds to blame skin cancer on chemicals as on
<br>
exposure to the sun.'
<br>
<p>In other words the 'cure' may be as dangerous as the complaint. 'The available
<br>
evidence simply isn't capable of telling us whether sunscreens are a
<br>
protection or a potential menace. With the best will in the world, the
<br>
sun-care industry cannot scientifically reassure its customers that this or
<br>
that product is safe.'
<br>
<p>These are startling, provocative words, yet they are supported by skin cancer
<br>
experts. Dermatologist Professor Rona Mackie of Glasgow University told The
<br>
Observer. 'There have been several studies which have indicated that melanoma
<br>
patients tend to use more sunscreens than people who do not get melanomas.'
<br>
<p>'Of course, this link may have a lot to do with the way individuals use such
<br>
creams. Most people spread sunscreen too thinly and so weaken its protective
<br>
powers. In other words, people are going out in the sun, using creams in the
<br>
mistaken belief they are protected against strong sunlight - and are getting
<br>
cancer. That would explain the correlation with sunscreen use and cancer
<br>
levels.'
<br>
<p>Skin cancer expert Dr Julie Newton Bishop, of the Imperial Cancer Research
<br>
Fund, also backed Baker.
<br>
<p>'Creams with a sun protection factor rating of up to 15-20 are OK. However,
<br>
those with higher ratings only achieve such protection by increasing
<br>
concentrations of their key chemical components, and these can cause
<br>
irritation. So, yes, one should be aware that sun screens are not a panacea.'
<br>
<p>Then there is the question of cholesterol. After researchers in the 1970s and
<br>
1980s found strong evidence that high levels of cholesterol were triggering
<br>
heart attacks, most Western nations introduced policies aimed at cutting fat
<br>
from diets - and have witnessed a corresponding drop in the incidence of
<br>
coronary disease. The link would seem undeniable.
<br>
<p>Baker disagrees. He points out that heart attack rates have also dropped in
<br>
Eastern countries, such as Japan, even though people there now eat more
<br>
hamburgers, chips and other fatty foods. He argues that it is far more likely
<br>
that improvements in diagnosis and treatment are responsible for the decline
<br>
in coronary disease.
<br>
<p>Baker believes that high cholesterol levels and a high risk of heart attack
<br>
are both caused by other factors. 'Unemployment, stress, high blood pressure,
<br>
general unrest and sleep disturbance are probably all involved,' he states.
<br>
<p>In other words, high cholesterol is just a symptom, not a cause of coronary
<br>
disease. Efforts to reduce levels in the blood are therefore a waste of time,
<br>
and are only being shored up by a multi-million-dollar food industry with too
<br>
much to lose.
<br>
<p>'Millions of healthy people have been cajoled into changing their diet to rid
<br>
them of a chemical they may even need,' he says.
<br>
<p>However, Baker's claims are not supported by coronary scientists. 'I find the
<br>
causative link between cholesterol and heart disease quite convincing,' said
<br>
Professor Godfrey Smith of Glasgow University's Institute of Biomedical and
<br>
Life Science.
<br>
<p>'When you give people drugs like statins, their cholesterol levels are lowered
<br>
and their risk of suffering heart attacks reduced. It seems perfectly clear to
<br>
me.'
<br>
<p>Other targets for Baker's wrath are GM foods, whose supporters and opponents
<br>
are both accused of using sloppy science to make their cases. On the issue of
<br>
global warming he says the evidence that our planet is heating up because of
<br>
mankind's industrial activities is unimpressive, most of it being based on
<br>
computer models whose outcomes are easy to manipulate.
<br>
<p>'Scientists haven't yet found enough consistent evidence or powerful enough
<br>
analytical tools to reach a consensus - even among themselves, let alone to
<br>
convince self-interested governments and industries.'
<br>
<p>As for depression, far from being a curse it may actually represent the risk
<br>
one pays for having a nature that is 'exceptionally appraising, empathetic,
<br>
introspective, romantic and imaginative as a result of its particular
<br>
structure, activity and chemistry'.
<br>
<p>In short, depressive people are more creative and artistic than the average
<br>
non-depressed person. This does not stop their suffering, of course, but in
<br>
most cases doing nothing turns out to be the best a psychiatrist can achieve
<br>
for a depressive. Baker states: 'Doing nothing produces an 80 per cent
<br>
recovery.'
<br>
<p>He adds: 'We need a way of identifying people with a genetic predisposition
<br>
without having to wait for them to become depressed.' Until these goals are
<br>
achieved, psychologists are merely stumbling around, Baker implies.
