<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - Racism is a belief system that non-physical attributes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; derive from race.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is getting close to my definition. &quot;The belief that a race is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherently superior or inferior based on genetics&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I don't like using &quot;genetics&quot; because it is too difficult to prove whether
<br>
something is 100% genetic, 100% environment, or somewhere in-between.  I
<br>
also think that the belief that environments makes &quot;all&quot; people of one race
<br>
behave one way while &quot;all&quot; people of another race behave a different way
<br>
would also be racist even if it is not genetically based.  I agree that
<br>
genetics is the probably the only reasonable explanation for any
<br>
characteristic to be spread to &quot;all&quot; members of one race, but I don't think
<br>
it is a required part of the definition.  Under this definition there could
<br>
have been no racism before DNA was discovered.  Or a person who is not
<br>
educated about genetics can't be racist.  I think the scientific theory of
<br>
genetics is not required to practice racism.  This would almost require that
<br>
only scientists could be racists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; - Prejudice is pre-judging an individual before evaluating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their individual merits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree to this as applied to people, but I think we can leave out &quot;before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluating their individual merits&quot; as extra verbiage not required.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; - Racial Prejudice is prejudice based on an individual's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; membership in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; racial group.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; - Discrimination is making choices between different options.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - Racial Discrimination is making choices between different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; options based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; race.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also agreed
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't see how someone can racially pre-judge someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without having the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; belief system of racism.  I don't see how someone can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; racially discriminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; against someone without having the belief system of racism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; These terms are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inextricably intertwined thusly:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Step 1:  Racism - holding certain beliefs about races
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Step 2:  Racial Prejudice - applying those beliefs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individuals based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; step 1
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Step 2 doesn't require step 1. Like we discussed before, Jesse may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that blacks cause more crime based on race (I don't either), but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still believe that blacks cause more crime because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environmental factors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and still make decisions based on race because of this.
</em><br>
<p>This is where your reference to &quot;genetics&quot; and my definition diverge.  You
<br>
seem to be saying that if behavior isn't genetic, it is not racism.  Under
<br>
your definition saying &quot;All blacks are lazy&quot; is racist if one thinks they
<br>
have a genetic predisposition to be lazy.  But the same statement is not
<br>
racist if one thinks they have a cultural predisposition to be lazy.  I
<br>
disagree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Step 3:  Racial Discrimination - taking actions against those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Taking actions &quot;against&quot; sounds a bit negative, when it could also be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applied in a positive light. i.e. Giving a race special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privileges over some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Norm&quot;. I would just say taking action on some race because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their race. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know, nitpicking again... but just trying to be clear.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  Taking any actions to treat one race differently than another is
<br>
racial discrimination.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This goes back to black cops and Jesse again. I think they are grouping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blacks together into a group based on environmental causes (same living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions, culture, neighborhoods?), not genetic heritage, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2 are very similar. The reason to nitpick this though is because without a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear understanding of this, a white person can not in fact point to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same issues that Jesse and black cops point to without being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labeled racist.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps.  But I was recently reminded that we can't redefine a word just
<br>
because we don't want to apply it the way it was intended.  I think that
<br>
there is an implied assumption that racism is defined as &quot;bad&quot;.  (I believe
<br>
that it bad, but not by definition.)  I think the tendency to show
<br>
statistical support for prejudice and discrimination as a justification that
<br>
it isn't racism is misguided.  It is racism.  It is a belief in &quot;justified&quot;
<br>
racism rather than &quot;unjustified&quot; racism, but the belief system, prejudiced
<br>
assumptions and resulting discrimination are the same.  Otherwise we end up
<br>
using different labels depending which side we are on, much as pro-Life and
<br>
pro-Choice factions do.  Those who believe in justified prejudice and
<br>
discrimination will argue that it's not racist because it's true, while
<br>
those that disbelieve will call it racism.
<br>
<p>(This is a similar definition problem with defining &quot;religion&quot; as a false
<br>
belief.  We then have religious people saying that their belief in God is
<br>
not a religion because it's true.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do thank you for the rational discussion on this though, I have to admit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this has been one of the more reasonable discussions I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; witnesses.
</em><br>
<p>I thank you too.  Sometimes this list can have rational discussions on
<br>
controversial issues.
