<em>&gt; God bless you Damien for wanting to offer some slack to the failures of life!  It's too bad you're not in a position to change the system. lol I'm one of those who f***** up, and now have the collection vultures circling overhead and driving me crazy.  The garnishment of my paycheck will be coming soon...

<em>&gt; This is somewhat like the system we currently use in Oz, with deferred payment--although wealthy parents can currently pay a smaller fee up front; presumably this reduces expensive paperwork and saves the institutions the risk of losing money on the kids who kill themselves, go mad or default.

<em>&gt; The aussie gal I used to know told me she went through a college system where only the better highschool students get to attend college(she was one).  And you paid back the cost of your education by paying a flat percentage of one's future salary.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, is Australia changing over to the American system?  Did the world banking system influence your gov't to go this route?  Are higher profits possible through the U.S. method of doing things? lol
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I think the &quot;new&quot; American method is to have young people pay for college by joining the military -the National Guard being the most likely form of it.  This has the advantage of allowing you to be a fulltime student while serving.  Folks even prefer the military over student debt! lol
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I realize obviously both methods have their pros and cons.  I look forward to your input.
