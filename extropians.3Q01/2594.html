</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In most historical circumstances in which a free society was

</em><br>
<p>Here in the US, the income tax, which was first instituted for the civil
<br>
war, then for WWI funding, was always, and is today, a voluntary system
<br>
for most people (with the exception of federal employees, officers, and
<br>
beneficiaries), only they don't know it only because a) so many have
<br>
been one of the three above for so long they have forgotten theirs is
<br>
not the default state, and b) the patriotic fervor effectively stamped
<br>
out any feeling of 'choice' in the matter, i.e. if you didn't pay, you
<br>
were disloyal, unpatriotic, etc.
<br>
<p>Now, the US has not been under serious threat of invasion since the 1812
<br>
war with Britain (the Japanese posession of a few Aleutian Islands
<br>
during the opening battles of our WWII involvement merely a diversionary
<br>
tactic), so we've really not had any real reason to be concerned about
<br>
our 'societies perishing'. Indeed, it can be very well argued that the
<br>
war with Japan was simply staged by the willful ignorance of the US
<br>
government of decoded transmissions of Japanese Naval and diplomatic
<br>
codes, the presence of Churchill at the White House at that time being
<br>
of interesting note as well, AND that Japan's attacks were instigated by
<br>
British disinformation that led the Japanese to believe we'd defend
<br>
British and Dutch colonies in the Pacific. I don't believe we ever had
<br>
any such sentiment. I'd be rather interested in war gaming a Japanese
<br>
attack in late 1941 that ignored Hawaii and the Phillipines in favor of
<br>
Singapore, Indonesia, etc. I doubt very much that the US would have been
<br>
at all interested in engaging the Japanese if the Japanese scrupulously
<br>
avoided US posessions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I claim that from 1870 to 1940, the United States was such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society, and had a sufficient but realistic threat from Japan,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Germany, and possibly the Soviet Union materialized, all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have been lost without the laudable capabilities that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S. did possess to coerce industry to make armaments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; draft soldiers into enormous armies, and tax people at whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the necessary rate would have been.  I am even considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlikely cases, such as some alliance of Germany, France, England
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Japan in 1905 deciding to conquer North America.  Those nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working together could only have been defeated by the U.S. in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way I've described.  Consideration of examples like this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warranted by our wishing to establish general principles here.
</em><br>
<p>Well, since in 1870 Japan had no navy worth mentioning, it was only in
<br>
1905 that they kicked Russia's Pacific Navy, and neither the Russians
<br>
nor Japan had a Navy at that time that could compete with the US Navy,
<br>
which was not funded by any confiscatory taxation at that point, I'd
<br>
have to say you are really BSing here.
<br>
<p>Despite being a trade ally of Germany in WWI, the Japanese scrupulously
<br>
avoided the US Navy in the Pacific throughout WWI. It was not until the
<br>
Japanese engaged in its Yamato/Musashi battleship program (which
<br>
destroyed the Washington Treaty limitations on battleship construction)
<br>
in the late 1930's, along with its aircraft carrier program, that Japan
<br>
offered any significant threat with its Navy, and advanced as its Navy
<br>
was at the time, its Army was still stuck in WWI, along with some of the
<br>
most ill conceived firearms designs of the era (as any firearms expert
<br>
will attest).
<br>
<p>Fantasy alliances of all the world powers against the US are rather
<br>
ludicrous, especially in respect to other english nations, and allying
<br>
Germany and France at that point in time is similarly ludicrous.
