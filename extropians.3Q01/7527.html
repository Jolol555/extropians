<p>Its far worse than that, as you go deeper it gets much warmer.
<br>
I believe the deepest mines now have problems with plastic
<br>
deformation of the rocks and explosions where the pressure
<br>
can expel weakly bonded rocks.  So you have to line the tunnel
<br>
with a strong material.  Your limit with even nanotechnology
<br>
will be the point at which relatively common materials hit
<br>
their property limits.  Titanium carbide melts at 3413K,
<br>
it probably starts losing its material strength at 60-70%
<br>
of that value (2000-2400K).  I don't know how fast the
<br>
temperature rises with depth, but this is going to set a
<br>
hard limit on how deep you can go without a requirement for
<br>
active cooling.  The tunnel cooling towers are going to make
<br>
nuclear reactor cooling towers look like midgets.  Though
<br>
if you do it right, you can produce a lot of energy this way.
<br>
Its nonrenewable over the long run of course.
<br>
<p>The other thing to consider is earthquake fault lines.
<br>
An fault line shift across a tunnel is going to be
<br>
very bad for trains approaching it.  It probably requires
<br>
a double shell tunnel that allows shifts in the alignment
<br>
of the outer shell without affecting the inner shell.
<br>
That is going to require active repair of the outer
<br>
shell following any earthquake.
<br>
<p>Bottom line -- I don't think this will work for the Earth
<br>
until it has cooled to a relatively solid mass.  It could
<br>
work for the moon however.
