Harvey Newstrom has finally done what some of us (e.g. Jerry Mitchell)
<br>
were fearing would never be done; namely to say specifically exactly
<br>
what was racist about Fred Reed's piece.  I, myself, have not made up
<br>
my mind about it (one of the difficulties being to determine what is
<br>
meant by &quot;racist&quot;).
<br>
<p>But thanks to Zero Powers for providing one concrete example (as I,
<br>
for one, had asked).  Zero wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OK, I suppose you expect me to try to pull out a sentence in that &quot;essay&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is either false or unduly disparaging of blacks.  Well I grant you the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post didn't contain anything on the order of: &quot;All niggers are shiftless, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lazy, criminals who have made no worthwhile contribution to society&quot; or &quot;The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only good nigger is a dead nigger.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; But, how about this:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; People in, say, Switzerland can walk their streets after dark. We can't. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Why?  What have we got that they don't, that might cause fear?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Elvis impersonators, Johnny. Yep. Switzerland doesn't have any Elvis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;impersonators. Check for yourself.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; The clear implication (granted while made with tongue in cheek) is that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Swiss are safe after dark because, unlike we woeful Americans, they don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have blacks to deal with.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  That's the implication.  And I think anyone is crazy who believes
<br>
that people of only one race in America commits crimes, or even that people
<br>
of any particular race don't commit crimes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The unspoken suggestion is that if we were to ship all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blacks back to Africa the good white folks of this great 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country could take all the locks off their doors and live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in peace and safety.
</em><br>
<p>Yes; but what would Fred Reed's response be?  I think that if he
<br>
is at all rational---which of course, he is, then he would have
<br>
to admit that he is exaggerating.  His real point, he'd contend,
<br>
is that black people commit a disproportionate amount of crime. 
<br>
He notes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What price do we put on looking over our shoulders?  On watching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be sure we don't go one subway stop too far?  Warning our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; girlfriends not to drive on certain streets?  Checking the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clientele of Seven-Eleven before going in at night?
</em><br>
<p>To me, it's an empirical question about whether people (of any race)
<br>
do express the worries that he cites here.  I don't live in New York,
<br>
but it wouldn't surprise me if caution about what subway stop you
<br>
take is real; and the mental imagery that attends the caution may
<br>
be not just tough neighborhoods, but black neighborhoods.  I don't
<br>
know.   Yes, I'd look over the clientele of a Seven-Eleven before
<br>
I went in.  THere are many people of many different races and
<br>
complexions (e.g. skin-heads) that would make me cautious.  But
<br>
I will honestly admit that race is a factor:  given everything else
<br>
being equal, I am more likely to be apprehensive about a store full
<br>
of black people than white people.  Moreover, this sentiment is not
<br>
confined only to whites:  I heard a young black woman on the radio
<br>
say one day that if she's walking down the street and sees four black
<br>
guys coming, she crosses the street, whereas, she felt less compelled
<br>
to take this action if she saw four white guys coming down the street.
<br>
<p>I would like to address the points that Harvey Newstrom made, but 
<br>
there isn't room in this email.  I wish to say that for a huge number
<br>
of otherwise rational thinkers, I am afraid, the statements that I
<br>
made above qualify and overqualify me as a racist.  Anyone who thinks so
<br>
please give me a careful analysis---not a one line emotionally driven
<br>
rejection or put-down.  (I hasten to point out that such stupid one-line
<br>
emotionally gratifying insults are hardly confined to those who accuse
<br>
others of being racist.)
<br>
<p>I cannot believe how charged and irrational a number of extropians
<br>
become on some issues.  Is there really *anything* that is not to
<br>
be logically and carefully analyzed?
<br>
<p>Lee
