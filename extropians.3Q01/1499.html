<p><p>C'mon John, you know better.  This is not 1960s technology.
<br>
<p>While ground radar does the work for the initial launch (e.g. Pointing it in
<br>
the right general direction), the guidance and control systems are *much*
<br>
more sophisticated than you suggested.  The terminal guidance systems of
<br>
choice these days for ABM work is broad spectrum IR, not radar, for a number
<br>
of technical reasons that I won't go into here.  Mid-trajectory guidance is
<br>
typically inertial.
<br>
<p>Spoofing state-of-the-art American guidance technology with decoys and
<br>
whatnot is very, very difficult.  Target discrimination is done by applying
<br>
close to a dozen different algorithms simultaneously to broad- or
<br>
multi-spectral sensor input, and analyzing the combined results of multiple
<br>
algorithms to find the money targets.  Current state-of-the-art
<br>
discrimination is sufficiently good that it easily exceeds the requirements
<br>
of economic reality.  The ABM systems will most certainly not be shooting
<br>
down beer cans.
<br>
<p>By &quot;exceeds the requirements of economic reality&quot; I mean that the kind of
<br>
decoy sophisticated enough to fool the discrimination technology would be
<br>
sufficiently heavy and complicated that one might as well just put another
<br>
warhead in place of the decoy.  The whole point of decoys is that they need
<br>
to be much lighter and cheaper than the warheads so that they can be
<br>
piggybacked with minimal cost.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Sure it does. Example: You spend a trillion dollars or so on a super powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LASER system to shoot things down. I paint my warheads white, now it needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundreds or thousands of times the intensity to do the same thing.
</em><br>
<p><p>If only it were actually that easy to defeat a high-powered laser...
<br>
