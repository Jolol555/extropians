<p>He actually went to college at a young age, and was the youngest bigshot

in the Manhattan Project. So young, in fact, that after the war, as a
<br>
newly minted professor at Cornell, when he was schmoozing some co-ed for
<br>
some horizontal tutoring, she declared him a liar when he said he had
<br>
worked on the Manhattan Project, assuming he was far too young to have
<br>
done anything so important.
