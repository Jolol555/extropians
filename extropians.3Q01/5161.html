<p>Please forgive me--I don't get the context here. 
<br>
* Which shelters are [Eugen*'s]?
<br>
* What, specifically, is &quot;such an attack&quot;?
<br>
I am guessing you are talking about nonballistic delivery.
<br>
<p>Fallout shelter tech has been dealt with in depth by Dean Ing,
<br>
Cresson Kearny and others. And they were working under the assumption
<br>
that you'd have a warning of a plume headed your way in the 30-120 
<br>
_minute_ range. This does include a lot of people not at ground zero,
<br>
especially of submegaton yield strikes, even if multiple.
<br>
<p>Shelters are hardly &quot;of no use&quot;--just no use to a poor sod out in the 
<br>
open, very nearby--since there'd be no air raid siren.
<br>
<p>But if somebody takes out (say) downtown San Jose, CA, and I am living
<br>
20 miles away, then hell, yes, a shelter is some use to me, depending on 
<br>
how the wind blows. It certainly beats dying in the exodus traffic jam.
<br>
<p>How about shelters 20 _blocks_ away? It depends.
