<em>&gt; &gt; Because of specialization, of course. You don't train people to be

<em>&gt; Good grief, what an insufferably elitist viewpoint.  Understanding how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science works or being familiar with its macro-concepts is not beyond the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual skills of people who &quot;pound nails all their lives.&quot;  One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't have to be a chemist in order to appreciate the integrity of the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking skills in our society.  Carl Sagan's &quot;Cosmos&quot; series did not appeal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primarily to scientists.  Science needs more and better PR, and certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the perpetuation of myths like &quot;science is too complicated to explain to

<em>&gt; dumb-asses like y'all ...&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Projecting again? 
<br>
<p>I recall in high school physics, where of the 35 people in the room, the
<br>
only two people that ever seemed to get the subject matter completely
<br>
were the teacher and myself. Often I wound up trying to translate and
<br>
analogize concepts for people when the teacher had exhausted their
<br>
toolkit.
<br>
<p>I don't think its impossible to teach nail pounders about science, but
<br>
the vast majority of them *have absolutely no interest* in it. By the
<br>
middle of high school, they are pretty much set on nail pounding as a
<br>
career (or the equivalent) and are of the opinion that &quot;I'll never use
<br>
this in real life&quot;. So long as their pappy was able to make a go of life
<br>
without an education, they really don't see a point in it.
