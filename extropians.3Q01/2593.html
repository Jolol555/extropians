<p><em>&gt; Haven't you ever awoken with a woozy feeling that something happened the night before, but you just

</em><br>
<em>&gt; back in the '70's that got the direct personal attention of the State Department, among others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Starting in the mi-80's, I had recurring dreams - at least remembered as dreams - of being
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Recently while I had a cold I had a wierd dream where my nostrils were
<br>
swollen and felt numb. At one point breathing was affected, and I
<br>
noticed a crack in the bridge of my nose where air was leeking out. I
<br>
was ok when I woke up, thank goodness.
<br>
<p>A day or so later I had a sudden flash of a hospital scene where people
<br>
were having large tubes stuffed up their nostrils.
<br>
<p>I had sinus surgery several years ago, maybe some dim memory of that?
<br>
<p>Wierd, huh...
