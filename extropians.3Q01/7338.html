<p><p>The U.S. and the British have the distinction of having some of the most
<br>
expensive soldiers in the world.  The cost of creating a soldier from a
<br>
civilian costs well in excess of US$60,000 for training and equipment.  When
<br>
you consider that large artillery shells and bombs cost less than $1,000 a
<br>
piece, you can see why the US military prefers to expend vast quantities of
<br>
ordnance rather than risk the life of a soldier -- soldiers are a lot more
<br>
expensive and take longer to replace.
<br>
<p>That said, the average third-world AK-series weapon is worth about $50.
<br>
Considering the relative lack of training and equipment spent per soldier in
<br>
those parts, I doubt that the average third-world soldier is worth more than
<br>
a thousand dollars, and probably much less when you are talking about an
<br>
impressed militia.  I would guess that when you consider the state of the
<br>
local economies in Afghanistan (per capita GDP: ~$178, one of the lowest in
<br>
the world according to several resources), US$20 would be a very adequate
<br>
bounty for an AK rifle.  I'm sure the influx of American dollars would be
<br>
good for the (underground) economy as well.
