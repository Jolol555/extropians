</em><br>
<em>&gt; be treated as foreigners by their government. As it stands, here in the
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; trusting fellow citizens too little, resulting in social strife and

</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks.
</em><br>
<p>I can see what you mean, but the more fundamental problem is Why would
<br>
someone want to exploit those weaknesses?  Granted, you'll always have a
<br>
random nut, but today's events were anything but random.  They seem aimed at
<br>
a deliberate result.
<br>
<p>That said, even if you beef up security, revise standards of trust, and the
<br>
like, you will have others going for the same deliberate result.  Recall,
<br>
airport security, as flawed as it is in the US, has, in the past, been
<br>
upgraded.
<br>
<p>I think the key here is US policy.  Granted, the ones who committed today's
<br>
mass killings and their backers deserve punishment.  Yet going forward, US
<br>
policy should be revised to only focus on areas of national interest.  Why
<br>
get involved, e.g., with people you [meaning you Michael] don't trust?  By
<br>
disengaging from regional conflicts, such as those in that cauldron known as
<br>
the Middle East, the ever balkanizing Balkans, Africa, and Latin America,
<br>
there would be less [foreign] people who would see the US as a party to
<br>
those conflicts and a potential target.
<br>
<p>The Swedes and the Swiss seem to have a very low incident of terrorism for
<br>
that very reason.  Note all the First World nations that do have high rates:
<br>
the US, Britain, France, and Italy.  Don't you see the connection?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the solution to this is to hold United and American Airlines, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well as the two security companies, and the airports from which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airplanes flew from, financially responsible for the damages of today's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks, for their negligence in ensuring the security of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airlines. The pressure of this financial impact will most certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force all other airlines to beef their security up to professional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels.
</em><br>
<p>As an interim measure, security should be revised, but I don't know if there
<br>
really was negligence.  Negligence implies some degree of foreknowledge.
<br>
<p>However, the long range solution involves disentangling the US from
<br>
conflicts that have little to do with the real interests or defense of the
<br>
US.  Maybe if some of that big aid package to Israel had gone to defending
<br>
the US's borders and airspace this wouldn't have happened.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
