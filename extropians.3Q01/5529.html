<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Yet another role for aspirin
<br>
<p>The inexpensive and widely available over the counter salicylates such as
<br>
aspirin have demonstrated a number of benefits over the last couple decades,
<br>
beyond their well known functions as fever and pain reliever.  Heart
<br>
disease, thrombotic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and some types of
<br>
cancer all have been found to be aided in their prevention by aspirin.
<br>
Researchers at Harvard Medical School's Joslin Diabetes Center and the
<br>
University of California, San Diego have uncovered yet another ability of
<br>
this wonder-drug, that of treating type-2 diabetes.
<br>
<p>Research published in the August 31 2001 issue of the journal Science
<br>
studied salicylates' effects on genetically obese mice and rats who are
<br>
prone to developing diabetes.  They found that the drug influenced a pathway
<br>
of cells known as the IKK-beta pathway that inhibits the effect of insulin.
<br>
Inhibiting IKK-beta threfore makes the body's own insulin more effective.
<br>
Salicylates were able to reverse the elevation in blood sugar, insulin and
<br>
fat levels in the mice and rats in this study.  Diabetes is believed to
<br>
occur when the body produces inadequate amounts of insulin, yet frequently
<br>
insulin levels are higher than normal in diabetics because the cells become
<br>
resistant to insulin, the hormone that converts glucose into energy.
<br>
<p>Next, the researchers bred mice to have lower levels of the IKK-beta
<br>
molecule, thought to be aspirin's target, and found that they were prevented
<br>
from developing obesity and insulin resistance when fed a high fat diet that
<br>
would normally induce this phenomenon.  The authors state, &quot;These findings
<br>
implicate an inflammatory process in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance
<br>
in obesity and type 2 diabetes and identify the IKKIB pathway as a target
<br>
for insulin sensitization.&quot;
<br>
<p>It has long been known that aspirin could lower blood sugar, but the six to
<br>
eight gram daily doses necessary to accomplish this can have side effects.
<br>
Harvard medical School associate professor of medicine and lead study
<br>
author, Steve Shoelson, MD predicted, &quot;If a drug could be developed with
<br>
this capacity to lower blood sugar, but without high-dose aspirin's side
<br>
effects,we could potentially have a potent new treatment for type 2
<br>
diabetes.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Neuropathy
<br>
<p>The majority of diabetics will eventually develop some degree of neuropathy.
<br>
Conventional medicine offers little in the prevention or treatment of
<br>
diabetic neuropathy, yet there is a great deal of published information
<br>
showing that the proper use of dietary supplements can be of significant
<br>
benefit.
<br>
<p>Diabetes is associated with a fatty acid imbalance. In experimental models,
<br>
essential fatty acid desaturation contributes to reductions in peripheral
<br>
nerve conduction velocity and blood flow. This fatty acid imbalance may be
<br>
corrected by dietary supplements that contain gamma-linolenic acid (GLA),
<br>
such as borage oil. In animal studies, significant improvements in blood
<br>
flow and nerve-conduction velocity were observed in response to GLA
<br>
supplementation.
<br>
<p>Nerve conduction and perfusion deficits in diabetic rats have been corrected
<br>
by a combination of antioxidant and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) supplements.
<br>
A deficit in sciatic nutritive endoneural blood flow was corrected by 34.8%
<br>
with GLA therapy, and by 24.8% with free radical scavenger therapy. When
<br>
both treatments were combined, a flow improvement of 72.5% was observed.
<br>
This study showed a synergistic effect of antioxidant and omega-6 essential
<br>
fatty acid (GLA) when used in combination against diabetic neuropathy.
<br>
<p>Deficient and toxic neuropathies can be alleviated by improving lifestyle
<br>
and dietary factors. The following combinations of nutritional supplements
<br>
might be particularly effective:
<br>
<p>Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), fish oil concentrate, and ascorbyl palmitate
<br>
offer a potential synergistic approach to correcting a fatty acid imbalance
<br>
by enhancing blood flow to the nerves, and protecting against free radicals.
<br>
A suggested regimen would be to take 3 capsules of Mega GLA (gamma-linolenic
<br>
acid supplement), along with 3 capsules of Mega EPA (fish oil concentrate),
<br>
and 500 mg of ascorbyl palmitate twice a day. If symptoms alleviate or
<br>
disappear, the dose of GLA and EPA could be reduced to 2 capsules twice a
<br>
day.
<br>
<p>Vitamin B12 in the form of methylcobalamin in the dose of 5 to 40 mg a day,
<br>
taken in lozenge form under the tongue, along with 2000 to 5000 mcg of folic
<br>
acid has been shown to correct many neurological diseases, including
<br>
neuropathy.
<br>
<p>Protect against free radicals and enhance neuronal energy metabolism by
<br>
taking 250 mg of alpha-lipoic acid twice a day, 1000 mg of
<br>
acetyl-L-carnitine twice a day, 600 mg of NAC (N-acetyl cysteine) twice a
<br>
day, and 3000 mg of vitamin C twice a day.
<br>
<p>Taking a broad-spectrum multinutrient formula can help suppress free radical
<br>
injury to the nerves, while supplying supplemental amounts of folic acid and
<br>
vitamin B12. Life Extension Mix (3 tablets 3 times a day) is a 67 ingredient
<br>
multivitamin, mineral, herbal, and amino acid supplement that provides a
<br>
concentrated dose of nutrients. Life Extension Mix also has a high level of
<br>
pantothenic acid, which has a synergistic benefit when used with
<br>
alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) common in diabetic protocols.

AGE breakers by Carmina Borek PhD
<br>
<p>The rate of advanced glycation endproducts' (AGEs)accumulation and the
<br>
degree of stiffness they produce are proportional to blood glucose levels
<br>
and the length of time these levels persist. Evidence that advanced
<br>
glycation endproducts are important contributors to a loss of elasticity is
<br>
provided by observations that high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) in young
<br>
diabetic rats accelerates the stiffening of the heart muscle (myocardium)
<br>
and that chemicals that inhibit the formation of advanced glycation
<br>
endproducts prevent the stiffening of the tissues. Additional supporting
<br>
evidence comes from human observations. People with diabetes, whose high
<br>
blood glucose is not readily restored to normal, show substantially larger
<br>
amounts of advanced glycation endproducts in their tissues. They also show
<br>
increased stiffness, compared to age matched nondiabetic individuals.
<br>
Age-related cardiovascular disorders that are linked to advanced glycation
<br>
endproducts-atherosclerosis, hypertension, stroke and heart failure-are
<br>
frequent complications in diabetes. In fact it has been suggested that
<br>
diabetes is an accelerated form of aging. Conversely, it is speculated that
<br>
increased longevity associated with reduced caloric intake may be due to
<br>
lower amounts of advanced glycation endproducts formed in the body.
