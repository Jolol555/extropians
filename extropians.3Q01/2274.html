<p>
In the business world, competitors are potential parters and partners are
<br>
potential competitors. Another business entity is either potentially both or
<br>
neither.
<br>
<p>Organised religions have a lot going for them in terms of getting things
<br>
done. Most of this occurs at the local level of organization -- high-level
<br>
goals for organized religions are fairly diffuse and open to interpretation.
<br>
<p>Building upon some earlier remarks made on this list about the futility of
<br>
attempting to remove religions from the human picture (just as futile as
<br>
attempting to remove all other corporations because they compete with yours;
<br>
you're attacking the &quot;symptom&quot; and the &quot;problem&quot; can't be dealt with -- it's
<br>
just human nature), is there any good reason not to attempt to found and
<br>
nurture a purposeful religion? By this I mean one dedicated to -- for
<br>
example -- either building or funding the building of God/a god (== true AI)
<br>
or achieving immortality. (Both very Gnostic goals, but Gnosticism had a
<br>
nice long run of things).
<br>
<p>Religions seem to be easy to start (on the absolute scale of human
<br>
endeavors). Easier than founding a government, for example. Or putting
<br>
people on the moon. Potentially achievable by two people in a basement with
<br>
access to a fax machine, to call to mind one example. It allows for tapping
<br>
into a wellspring of human motivation; promise(/suggest/hypothesise) later
<br>
happiness/other benefit in exchange for resouces now. A number of
<br>
extropianist projects fall nicely into that category, mine included.
<br>
<p>We have plenty of examples of cults and religions -- the only difference is
<br>
size, really -- founded in the last two centuries. Mormonism, Discordianism,
<br>
modern Wicca, the Church of Satan, etc, etc, etc. Some have done pretty well
<br>
for themselves, memetically speaking.
<br>
<p>So we have all these billions of people in the world expending their
<br>
religious impulses and a fraction of their disposable income and time on
<br>
religions that aren't really getting anything useful done. Looks just like
<br>
an established marketplace that's worth entering. Never compete when you can
<br>
co-opt.
