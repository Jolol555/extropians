Eugene forwards from

<em>&gt; <a href="http://newsreal.yellowbrix.com/pages/newsreal/Story.nsp?story_id=22959526&ID=newsreal&scategory=Internet">http://newsreal.yellowbrix.com/pages/newsreal/Story.nsp?story_id=22959526&ID=newsreal&scategory=Internet</a>&amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only way to cope with all this is to embrace the positive effects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - using embryos to overcome infertility as well as to coax cures for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alzheimer's and diabetes - and to criminalize such acts of despotism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as &quot;reproductive cloning,&quot; which is growing copies of people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The last thing we need is for biomedical researchers such as Zavos to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operate in secret and in other countries, without criteria or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regulations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, the only way to do that is for the federal government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fund the research and to fund it at levels substantially higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than President Bush proposed last week when he proposed that we limit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; federally funded research to the 60 stem-cell lines in existence.
</em><br>
<p>I'm confused by the apparent contradiction here.  The article says
<br>
that the &quot;only way to cope&quot; with cloning is to criminalize it.  Then it
<br>
turns around and seems to say that the federal government should fund
<br>
cloning research?  Am I reading this wrong?  Perhaps an editing problem?
<br>
What exactly is the writer trying to say should be done in terms of
<br>
cloning policy?
