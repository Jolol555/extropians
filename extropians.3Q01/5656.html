</em><br>
<p>Several options spring to mind.
<br>
<p>For starters, do they take insane people? Most armies don't. If you can
<br>
get yourself certified as a manic-depressive they'll probably avoid you
<br>
like crazy.
<br>
<p>Or you could do what my friend C. did when the Italian army conscripted
<br>
him for a year. (Italy has since abolished conscription -- probably as a
<br>
result of their experience with C.) Make it a struggle of personal
<br>
survival, and fuck the army.
<br>
<p>C. was midway through a PhD in computer science in Scotland when his draft
<br>
deferment ran out. So he went to do his 12 months' military service in,
<br>
shall we say, a spirit of open-minded enquiry. C. is an anarchist -- not
<br>
by ideology, but by attitude. He's also a computer language lawyer. That
<br>
combination is pure poison to a conscript army.
<br>
<p>Conscript armies rely on drafting a large intake of relatively young and
<br>
inexperienced men, teaching them to obey orders, and telling them what to
<br>
do. C. was seven years older than normal when his deferrments ran out, and
<br>
was perfectly capable of managing himself. So at first he hunkered down, did
<br>
as he was told, and read the rule book.
<br>
<p>(Note that last clause. All armies have rules and regulations, but most
<br>
soldiers don't read them. In fact, as C. discovered, most officers don't
<br>
read them either -- and can be embarrassed when this is demonstrated
<br>
under the right circumstances.)
<br>
<p>C. did have a bit of fun during basic training. He's got weird eye trouble
<br>
-- not enough to get out of the army, but enough to have generated a
<br>
very big caseload for an ophalmic surgeon when he was younger. That's
<br>
probably how he got away without being court-martialled when he threw
<br>
the practice grenades the wrong way (at the passing officers). But from
<br>
that point, he managed to convince the army that he was more use as a 
<br>
computer programmer than as cannon fodder.
<br>
<p>(Remember that. Armies need clerks. Clerks get to stay in comfortable
<br>
air conditioned barracks and not get shot at. Remember this, too: NEVER
<br>
trust a piece of software written by a conscripted programmer supervised
<br>
by officers who don't understand what he's doing.)
<br>
<p>When in barracks, C. read the rule books from cover to cover. He also
<br>
brushed up on his history of politics, reading various items -- Marx,
<br>
Hitler, that sort of thing -- and loudly explaining their views to the
<br>
naive 18-year-olds he was bunking with. (Do that successfully and you can
<br>
get a reputation as being a prize nuisance and politically unreliable,
<br>
without actually crossing the fine line into sedition. After all, all
<br>
you're doing is studying history, right?)
<br>
<p>They gave C. a call-up database to repair. It ran on a PC and had been 
<br>
written by an earlier conscript, but mysteriously stopped working a week
<br>
after he was mustered out. C. got the database working, but it took this 
<br>
expert in compiler architecture six months to fix two hundred lines of 
<br>
dBase code. In the process he Y2K-fixed it -- and made sure that nobody
<br>
with his family name would _ever_ be called up in time of war -- while
<br>
obfuscating the code to the point of unintelligibility.
<br>
<p>C.'s rule-book reading paid off in several ways. When he finally mustered
<br>
out, his was the only platoon on the base here all the conscripts had 
<br>
beards. He'd also discovered an interesting loophole that meant in his
<br>
second six months he spent eight days out of every two weeks on leave.
<br>
(He was assigned a weekend leave every two weeks, but allowed time off
<br>
in lieu for travel to and from his home town, by train and ferry. Only his
<br>
home town was down on his call-up papers as Edinburgh. Two days leave ...
<br>
and six days travel, because, as he pointed out to his commanding officer,
<br>
it said *by train and ferry* -- nothing about airports in there!)
<br>
<p>The final straw was when they put him on guard duty one Saturday night.
<br>
As the oldest private in his squad he was in charge. He announced that
<br>
they were going to enforce the rules, by the book -- and proceeded to
<br>
do so with gusto. With so much gusto that the next Monday the General
<br>
commanding the base dropped by to politely ask him to notify the general's
<br>
office next time he pulled that stunt. Then he was unaccountably sent
<br>
on unscheduled leave for two weeks, and discharged two weeks early when
<br>
he returned.
<br>
<p>(Regulations said that anyone entering the base after 10pm would be
<br>
arrested unless they had a pass signed by a certain senior officer. Said
<br>
senior officer was on home leave that weekend. This being the Italian army,
<br>
and it being a Saturday night, the rule was regularly flouted. C. managed
<br>
to legitimately arrest 50% of the officers on the base and hold them in an
<br>
unheated guardroom in winter for an entire weekend.)
<br>
<p>In fact, by obeying the rules, C. probably did more damage to the Italian
<br>
army than a deliberate saboteur could. He really didn't like the whole
<br>
idea of conscription, and while he thought having the government give
<br>
him hiking clothes and training him in how to shoot was cool, he wasn't
<br>
keen on the sillier aspects of military life. So he made sure he 
<br>
understood the rules, didn't do anything he could be court-martialled
<br>
for ... then had fun thinking up creative ways to fuck the army.
<br>
<p>It was to some extent the spread of this sort of attitude that forced them
<br>
to abolish conscription. If they're going to draft you in Singapore, you
<br>
might want to meditate on it. Think like a programmer. Remember, managing
<br>
programmers is like herding cats. You, too, can be a cat ...
