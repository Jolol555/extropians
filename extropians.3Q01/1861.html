I thought this might be of interest to you all...
<br>
<p>-----Original Message-----
<br>
<p>Hello-  
<br>
&nbsp;The last few days have been very intense and eye
<br>
opening. I am in Genova where many people from around
<br>
the world have shown up to peacefully demonstrate
<br>
against the Fascist G8. The news you will hear in the
<br>
US will most likely be very distorted and I think you
<br>
should know what really went on.  300,000 people from
<br>
drop the debt, anti globalization and socialist
<br>
support groups all began peacefully protesteing-  the
<br>
60,000 armed police were out of control: tear gass was
<br>
sprayed everywhere- for no purpose except to break up
<br>
the protesters, there was an information center where
<br>
people could go and get free water,food and info , the
<br>
police invaded and took 60 people away where they
<br>
violently beat them up for 2 hours, (this was after
<br>
the protest ended) they are all in the hospital now. A
<br>
23 year old Italian boy was shot point blank by a 20
<br>
year old police officer who basically panicked and
<br>
lost his mind. After the murder the other Assassini
<br>
police put their truck in reverse and deliberately ran
<br>
over the body, over 300 people are in the hospital. I
<br>
was at the demonstration noone had any type of weapons
<br>
but the police were fully equipped with battons tear
<br>
gas and guns which they unjustly used. Police were
<br>
even pulling other police off of people, it was the
<br>
most horrible thing I have ever seen- while this was
<br>
happening in the streets the members of the G8 were on
<br>
a cruise ship drinking wine eating pasta and watching
<br>
economically challenged naked African women parade
<br>
around them for entertainment (they called it &quot;art&quot;
<br>
but if you could have seen these pictures you would
<br>
have all flipped out)- The consumption of Bush, Blair
<br>
and Berlusconi alone with in the past 2 days has a
<br>
monetary value which could feed a small 3rd world
<br>
country I am sure. The last 2 days in Genova has been
<br>
a true war of the classes, Bush referred to the
<br>
protesters as an &quot;unrepresentative minority which will
<br>
have no effect&quot; and Berlusconi(Italian Prime minister
<br>
aka Fascist Bastarde) said he supported whatever the
<br>
police had to do to defend themselves. There was no
<br>
defense - just violence towards peaceful people
<br>
marching  for equality and rights of the working
<br>
class. I was so niave and now I am still a bit
<br>
shocked- i mean i know many police are violent,
<br>
ignorant and abuse their power- but what I saw, heard
<br>
and experienced in the past two days is completely
<br>
beyond what i could have imagined-They are like nazis-
<br>
they dont have to take any responsibility for their
<br>
violent actions because they are supported by the
<br>
government so they have no problem with tear gassing
<br>
and shooting rubber bulletts at innocent, elderly,
<br>
people in wheelchairs, anyone- I saw them and i
<br>
honestly believe they enjoyed it- they would totally
<br>
provoke people- it was so evil, and the people in
<br>
power dont care at all- it is like we are
<br>
peasants-Things really need to change- I am very glad
<br>
I was hear. The turn out was amazing awareness is
<br>
spreading- At one point the G8 even discussed
<br>
cancelling the conference (Bush was the one who was
<br>
completely against it of course)- despite the violence
<br>
I believe a lot of good came out of this weekend.
<br>
Change is a process and ironically enough the behavior
<br>
of the police has opened more peoples eyes to the
<br>
importance of a revolution.   I have been on an
<br>
emotional roller coaster the past 48 hours- the
<br>
collaboration and unity of people from numerous
<br>
organizations around the world coming together because
<br>
they care about our future was so beautiful, but then
<br>
the  ruthless violence of the police, and the apathy
<br>
of the G8 who were right there and could care less
<br>
made me so upset, and the boy, and the sweet old man
<br>
in front of me in a wheel chair that I lost sight of
<br>
when we haD  to run up the stairs-  . It was atrocious
<br>
- our world is a mess  My animosity towards police
<br>
brutality and imperialism has grown exponentially. I
<br>
am reading leave Genova and still processing
<br>
everything- I have a lot more info if anyone is
<br>
interested please let me know, and please let others
<br>
know what really happened if the media has produced
<br>
innacurate info. any way I am really tired, And
<br>
looking fowrd to going to Florence tonight- I hope all
<br>
of you are well- Spain was awesome I saw a great musiv
<br>
festivel, visited the alhambra and much more to tell
<br>
but not now- I miss you all and can not wait to see
<br>
you at burning man (maybe this year they can make the
<br>
man to model bush)- I love hearing from you all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;take care and be well
