Perhaps you should consider that economics is not now and has not 
<br>
been a science.  Any arguments made on an economic basis should be 
<br>
considered to have a large degree of uncertainty in them.  (I.e., 
<br>
are not worthy of *belief!*), no matter how appealing they are.
<br>
As a more practical matter, Minarchies and Anarchies have a 
<br>
distressing tendency to be unstable equilibria.  There have been a 
<br>
few small examples that remained stable until perturbed by external 
<br>
stresses, but I think that one needs to assume that there will be 
<br>
external stresses, if only of TV or Radio signals.  Unless one 
<br>
intends to run a pre-electric community, which, in fact, all of the 
<br>
successful - for - more - than - a -couple - of - decades examples 
<br>
that I can think of were.  Some of the were successful for multiple 
<br>
generations, but they were all small, isolated groups without 
<br>
complex internal structures (like corporations, insurance 
<br>
companies, security forces, etc.)
<br>
<p>I think it quite possible that as technology improves it will again 
<br>
become possible to create small, self-contained, communities, of 
<br>
the macro-life variety.  Possibly some of them will be extreme 
<br>
libertarian, of one flavor or another (but this implies that all 
<br>
life support is totally automated).
<br>
<p>What seems feasible now is to design systems to accomplish desired 
<br>
ends that don't have locally centralized controls.  It's somewhat 
<br>
interesting that we owe the best current example, the internet, to 
<br>
the US Army.  (They didn't wan an invading army to be able to sieze 
<br>
control.)  It's also noticable, however, and a bit sad, that as it 
<br>
becomes less regulated by the government it is increasingly siezed 
<br>
by monoplistic elements.  (Cable corporations, the Bell descendant 
<br>
companies, etc.)
<br>
<p>If you are libertarian, and have the appropriate skill set, you 
<br>
might want to consider becoming involved with the design of the 
<br>
next net, IPv6, I believe it's called.  This is happening now, and 
<br>
may well have a very strong influence on our lives in the near 
<br>
future.
<br>
<p>Private property is definitely a priority, but it happens only 
<br>
within an entire social context.  It is the social context that 
<br>
defines what is private, and what is property.  This isn't a given. 
<br>
&nbsp;We may be headed into an era when our very bodies are not 
<br>
considered our private property.  Or when they are considered 
<br>
disposable property.  And what about your children.  Are they 
<br>
property?  At what age?  These are social context questions.  
<br>
(Well, these days, legal questions.  But that's a subset of social 
<br>
context.)
