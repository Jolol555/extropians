<p><em>&gt; I agree.. that GI would most likely result in major economical

</em><br>
<em>&gt; upsetting, to say the least.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, calculating all the unintended consequences of acts
<br>
imposed by fiat isn't easy.  For a few people, this might tip
<br>
the balance about continuing to work. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How about providing a guaranteed 1500 kcal of cheapest food/day,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about 30sq.ft space in a shelter, and other necessities, no cash.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This would assure that only those who really need help would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take it (and only those who need it actually deserve it).  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I had earlier proposed that government money now used for 
<br>
even more onerous welfare schemes be reinvested in little rooms
<br>
in supermarkets, accessible from a back door, where people were
<br>
free to eat WWII C-rations, which aren't very delectable.
<br>
<p>But let's take a skeptical position about your plan, and imagine
<br>
a bad side-effect.  Every day there are poor people who face the
<br>
decision of whether or not to get serious and improve their lot.
<br>
I speak from experience.  One day as a chess bum, part-time
<br>
substitute teacher, I had to finally after many years make the
<br>
very painful decision to abandon southern California, and move
<br>
as far away as was practicable and study computers (which I did
<br>
not like).
<br>
<p>I think that there are many people who finally make a decision to
<br>
do something about their situation.  It may mean going back to
<br>
their home town and working for that uncle that they detest.  It
<br>
may mean moving to some other city to be free of their old gang,
<br>
and to get a fresh start.  It may mean owning up to the fact that
<br>
they just aren't making it, and going to night school.
<br>
<p>Everyone surely has to admit that for many people who are hovering
<br>
on the edge of hard choices, the advent of a GI would enable them
<br>
to keep postponing the taking of some difficult action.  But likewise,
<br>
so would the proposal of 1500 calories of free food and free shelter,
<br>
no strings attached.  Just so, all welfare that is *guaranteed* to
<br>
individuals has the same debilitating effect.  All of it.
<br>
<p>So what do I propose doing about those &quot;who for one reason or
<br>
another, many through no real fault of their own, become
<br>
economically unviable (the market literally has no need for
<br>
their labor sufficient to pay them a livable wage?&quot;  (Thanks
<br>
to Samantha for the wording.)  In another post, later.
