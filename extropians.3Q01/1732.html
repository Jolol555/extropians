<p><em>&gt; Yes.  I in good conscience advocate [a guaranteed minimal income].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do so because I believe it is essential to our long term wellbeing and
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>So I take it that you are in favor of your U.S. government right
<br>
now guaranteeing every adult a minimum income, no strings attached?
<br>
As there are about 200,000,000 of us presently, how much do you
<br>
think that we should all get?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In a society where all the physical necessities of life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are already present and where there are ample and open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunities to explore and grow there is nothing left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do but better yourself or simply hang out.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; latter eventually gets pretty boring.
</em><br>
<p>Well, some people will choose to better themselves by becoming
<br>
experts in the history of WWF wrestling, some will study
<br>
mathematics, some will hang out in gangs just as they do now,
<br>
and some will go hiking, mountaineering, and rock climbing
<br>
all the time.  How do you think that the Bush administration
<br>
should go about announcing that within a certain number of
<br>
years no one will need to work who doesn't want to?  Do you
<br>
think that taxes need to be raised much to support this?  Or
<br>
are you simply confident that the Singularity is so immanent
<br>
that all such questions are academic?
<br>
<p>Thanks in advance for your answers!  Meanwhile, to take a swing 
<br>
at your question,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, there is a question in such speculations.  And that is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do with the people who don't want to live in such relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradisical situations.   Should room be left virtually or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually for those who simply insist on living a life where most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their time and energy is spent anxiously maintaining a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;living&quot; and chasing after many things of the &quot;good life&quot; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are by design either not obtainable to all or that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disappear so easily as to keep up anxiety levels to make them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more productive and &quot;industrious&quot;?  Should we keep room for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who wish to &quot;make a living&quot; rather than living a life?  
</em><br>
<p>It worries me---and not a little---that you think that &quot;we&quot; could
<br>
or should &quot;keep room&quot; for those.  Providing for people is one thing,
<br>
but determining their conditions of life is another!  Can you sense
<br>
how this sounds a little totalitarian?  (Yes, I know you mean well,
<br>
but benevolent dictators from Caesar through Lenin and Castro really
<br>
did mean well also.)  Granted, after the big S, things will be a lot
<br>
different, but people should always be left as free as possible to
<br>
make whatever decisions they see best.
