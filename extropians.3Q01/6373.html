<em>&gt; &gt;My reaction, on the whole, is that people are trying to forcibly
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;history.  I don't think it is.  Not intrinsically.  I understand
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;course of history either.  It's just a lot of unnecessary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;pointless deaths.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have spoken to survivors of Pearl Harbor who say this is bigger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You seem to be missing the point. This is going to be a war against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organized terrorism, after this there may never be terrorism of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sort we know now. There may be isolated cases sure, but the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may come out from all this with the resolve to never let organized
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorism exist in the world again.
</em><br>
<p>Am baffled at how you can possible believe so passionately in a
<br>
such a blatantly simplistic idea.
<br>
The idea of a war on terrorism actually stamping major acts of terrorist
<br>
aggression is almost amusing. But the events of Tuesday make my
<br>
reaction more sad incredulity. Like world poverty and ignorance
<br>
the nature of terrorism is multifaceted and innately fluid.
<br>
Destroy one terrorist organization and i can guarantee that within
<br>
a year or so another will spring up with the sole mission of &quot;avenging it's
<br>
fallen martyrs&quot; particularly when dealing with Islamic terrorist.
<br>
<p>Am not advocating a non-armed response. Under the circumstance even
<br>
the most pacifistic natured probably understand the need for an armed 
<br>
retaliation.
<br>
But lets not fool ourselves into hallucinating that this will eradicate the 
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I'd call that significant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think people are missing part of the significance of shutting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;down air travel temporarily. Partly it is to prevent further acts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but it is also to trap any accomplices, so we can round them up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They are trapped here.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmmm the tiny cell that actually carried out this attack maybe trapped,
<br>
but if they organised in any way intelligently then no one of any 
<br>
consequence was
<br>
still within the US as the jets struck there targets.
<br>
<p>And when it comes to taking down Bin Ladden ( if he turns out to be guilty 
<br>
which looks likelier every day )
<br>
Unless the Taliban turn him over ( which is by no means guaranteed, even if 
<br>
the want too )  he will be extremely
<br>
difficult to locate. The Russians put significant numbers of both troops 
<br>
and hardware into the region admittedly
<br>
taking on a much larger nationally organized force, and got nowhere.
<br>
The terrain of Northern Afghanistan is full of saw backed mountain ranges 
<br>
full of caves and small communities,
<br>
which i image Bin Ladden and his followers know all too well. A small group 
<br>
could potentially hide out in there for years.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;If the US does do anything real, militarily, it will probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;involve more death and destruction than was caused by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;destruction of the World Trade Center, dozens or hundreds of bombs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;instead of two planes, dropped on some dirt-poor country far less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;capable of dealing with the disasters resulting from each and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;every bomb impact, and the only real end result will be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hatred of the United States.  I don't expect that will stop the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;United States from doing it anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We want the people who did this, plain and simple, and we will stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at nothing to get them. Anything or anybody who tries to stand in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the way will be destroyed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But that's not all there is to it, we want to eliminate organized
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorism forever, period.
</em><br>
Thats as nebulous and meaningless as saying you want to eradicate world
<br>
suffering. The world will ( probably for a few more decades ) contain 
<br>
disgruntled
<br>
groups or communities, who will resort to violence to attempt to further there
<br>
aims. As with personal violence it is the attitude and perspective that 
<br>
makes some
<br>
individuals willing to use violence that really need to be tackled head on. 
<br>
In order
<br>
to produce anything like a lasting peace.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;This is pretty much how I expected the future to go.  If we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;lucky, we'll make it to the Singularity inside the decade and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;won't see weapons of mass destruction used on major cities during
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that interval. But if we aren't that lucky, I won't be surprised.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If we eliminate organized terrorism we may never have to face these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scenarios.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;An idea worth dying, (and killing) for.
</em><br>
<p>Easily said when you can be pretty confident of your own safety during the 
<br>
ensuing conflict.
