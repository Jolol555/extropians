<em>&gt;From: Adrian `Guru Zeb` Harper &lt;<a href="mailto:guruzeb@blueyonder.co.uk?Subject=RE:%20WTC%20Insurance&In-Reply-To=&lt;F765ksqQFxnPagMamEW000170cb@hotmail.com&gt;">guruzeb@blueyonder.co.uk</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;Hmmmmm this brings me onto another topic, that many ppl on this list am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would instinctively react against. But does the situation with Bin Laden
</em><br>
<em>&gt;show that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it can be genuinely dangerous for too much financial power to be allowed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accrue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in one persons control.
</em><br>
<p>Of course it can.  Money is power.  If any one person has too much power 
<br>
than can mean danger for the rest of us.  I think that is at least some 
<br>
small part of the impetus for the national ganging up on Bill Gates.  He is 
<br>
arguably the most powerful man in the world.  Not only is he richer than 
<br>
anybody else, his influence is felt by virtually every computer user on the 
<br>
planet.
<br>
<p>Think about this:  He has the power to imbed in every copy of Windows or MS 
<br>
Office a &quot;back door&quot; that could let him monitor every computer using his 
<br>
software.  This could give him a bird's eye view of virtually every PC and 
<br>
laptop used by his business and legal competitors, not to mention those 
<br>
machines used by world-wide intelligence agencies.  Would he do it?  
<br>
Probably not.  If he were to be found out, he'd be massacred.  But could he? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he could.  That's scary.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
