<em>&gt; &gt; .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unlike Plato and Aristotle (Hegel, etc.) we do not believe that
</em><br>
there is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little divine element in us that needs to be nurtured. Darwin killed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; idea forever. &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Plato held that humans are composite creatures: bodies plus souls.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evolution does not conclusively show this view is false.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dualism is alive and well.
</em><br>
You are right on both accounts, I guess I overstated the Darwinian case when
<br>
I said it killed the soul hypothesis forever. The fact that empirical
<br>
theories are underdetermined by the evidence means that any theory might
<br>
rise from the ashes. The geocentric conception of the universe may yet turn
<br>
out to be true as well. What we need to discuss with empirical theories is
<br>
the probability that some view is false rather than it be conclusively shown
<br>
to be false. Furthermore, as the Damien Brodericks complex shows in another
<br>
post, our bodies might be the headquarters for multiple souls: the single
<br>
soul hypothesis is itself underdetermined by the evidence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some religious folks teach that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution was the means for perfecting a body for living in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of world but that the souls chose to enter these bodies.
</em><br>
Indeed, see my: <a href="http://207.150.192.12/temp/markal1/armsreligion.htm">http://207.150.192.12/temp/markal1/armsreligion.htm</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Before you jump all over that consider that many of us here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honestly expect to be able to upload the essence of ourselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or or progeny) into computers (astral plane anyone?) and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly download into bodies designed to our current needs in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole or part.  Dualism is still alive and well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Dualism is usually understood as an ontological doctrine, namely, that there
<br>
are two radical different sorts of stuff in the universe: soul stuff and
<br>
matter stuff. Is this your understanding? Are you saying that the only
<br>
possible (or plausible) explanation of human uploading requires appeal to
<br>
dualism in this sense? What would you say to matter-monists who believe that
<br>
this does not require dualism anymore than the fact that when say The Spike
<br>
comes out as a movie we might view it on VHS or DVD? Or do we need dualism
<br>
to explain VHS and DVD? Of course I am pulling your leg, but it does raise
<br>
the question of why a matter-monist cannot explain the soul being encoded as
<br>
information on different platforms. Mark
