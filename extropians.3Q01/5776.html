<p>
I had placed something in my garbage can that ants found
<br>
irresistable and so they did the traditional antic thing and
<br>
formed a trail from their hill to the food.  I carried my can
<br>
to the curb for collection, thereby interrupting their food-
<br>
gathering activities.  An hour later I noticed something
<br>
interesting.  The trail of ants was still there on the side of
<br>
the can.  There was a roughly circular anty area on the
<br>
sidewalk about 4 cm in diameter, perhaps 100 ants.  There
<br>
appeared to be no ants leaving the area.
<br>
<p>I studied what was happening there.  I watched and
<br>
estimated that an arbitrary line intersecting the ant trail
<br>
was crossed by about 10 ants per second in either direction.
<br>
The ants that were in the can when I move it crawled down
<br>
the side, reached the sidewalk, milled around for about
<br>
10 seconds, {perhaps wondering &quot;whaaaat in the hill?&quot;}
<br>
then evidently headed back the way she came.
<br>
<p>After an hour, then four hours later, the ants on the
<br>
side of the can showed no evidence of slowing down
<br>
or getting lost: their ant-flux remained about 10/sec
<br>
and there remained about 100 ants on the sidewalk.
<br>
This went on for hours.  I estimated the one-way
<br>
trip up or down the side took about 50 seconds.
<br>
So a round trip takes about 110 seconds plus
<br>
whatever time each ant spends inside the can.  So
<br>
if I estimate about a minute inside the can, then it
<br>
would take about three minutes for an ant to get some
<br>
food, walk down the can, wander in confusion on the
<br>
sidewalk, turn around and go back.  So they could
<br>
make perhaps 20 - 25 such round trips in an hour.
<br>
<p>Since this went on for hours.  Each of these ants walked
<br>
back and forth up and down that trash can probably
<br>
over a hundred times.  They didn't learn.  They simply
<br>
behaved in a sphexish manner, as described on page 360
<br>
in the Good Book by Hofstadter.  Conclusion: ants are
<br>
really stupid.  I haven't a clue what this story has to do
<br>
with extropianism, but my neighbors think Im some
<br>
kind of kook, outside with a flashlight watching ants
<br>
walk up and down my garbage can.  spike
