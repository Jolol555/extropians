<p>GLOBAL NETWORK STATEMENT ON HOUSE &amp; SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE
<br>
RECOMMENDATIONS ON STAR WARS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
<br>
<p>On September 7 the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 13-12, along party
<br>
lines, to recommend $7 billion in 2002 for Star Wars research and
<br>
development.  The recommendation would have the funds transfered to other
<br>
Pentagon priorities.
<br>
<p>While the Democrats on the committee stated that the $7 billion would be a
<br>
cut from Bush's requested amount of $8.3 billion, they also reassured the
<br>
public that it was still a 37% increase over Ballistic Missile Defense
<br>
Organization (BMDO) funding levels in 2001.
<br>
<p>Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) told a news conference that the $7 billion would still
<br>
provide large increases for both Theatre Missile Defense (TMD) and National
<br>
Missile Defense (NMD).
<br>
<p>The House Armed Services Committee, on August 1 recommended $8.2 billion for
<br>
BMDO in 2002.
<br>
<p>The full House and Senate still have to debate the 2002 funding levels in
<br>
the coming weeks and several amendments will be expected as opponents
<br>
attempt to seriously cut Star Wars funding.
<br>
<p>The Global Network maintains that research and development for all BMDO
<br>
programs must be zero funded if we are to prevent an arms race in space.
<br>
Just the process alone of Pentagon and aerospace corporation Star Wars
<br>
research and development is destabilizing as the message is sent to the rest
<br>
of the world that the U.S. intends to follow through with plans for &quot;control
<br>
and domination&quot; of space.
<br>
<p>History shows that with each advancement of weapons technology a new arms
<br>
race has always followed.  We urge all concerned citizens to do all they can
<br>
to oppose all BMDO funding for 2002 and beyond.
