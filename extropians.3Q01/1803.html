Jerry writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Ehrenbach is completely right (in her recent book _Nickled and Dimed_
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; which detailed her sojourns as a low paid worker) when she said that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we all exploit these low paid workers.  In fact, our own wealth and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; status depends upon their presence. If they were not poor and working
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to obtain the resources we possess, much of our wealth would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; worthless.... just pieces of green paper.
</em><br>
<p>(P.S. for all you newbies out there: the &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; means Jerry didn't write that)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why am I &quot;exploiting&quot; the guy at the drive through mcdonalds?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If he's a teen working there, I'd say its a great job for him.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it's a 30 year old man with a family working there, I'd say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he's made some REAL bad choices in his life. I guess you could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argue that our society exploits stupidity or lazyness...
</em><br>
<p>I doubt if you'd argue that  :-)   But in a free society, I don't
<br>
see what's wrong with exploitation.  Suppose that there is a great
<br>
labor surplus suddenly, and finally I can start a company that I've
<br>
dreamed about because labor is now so cheap.  What should we do with
<br>
the old Marxist term &quot;exploit&quot;?  Am I exploiting the labor shortage
<br>
and in particular the people I hire?
<br>
<p>Some will say 'yes' if it's also true that I'm making a killing.
<br>
Suppose that I'm raking in the bucks at an unbelievable rate.
<br>
Then the real signal that goes out through the economy is DO WHAT
<br>
THAT GUY DID!  THERE ARE OODLES OF MONEY IN IT!
<br>
<p>On the other hand, suppose that our culture is riddled with 
<br>
opponents of so-called exploitation, and I have to share all
<br>
my profits with them.  It now may (or may not be) worth it to
<br>
me to execute my plan, take the risks, and so on.  Besides, if
<br>
if I have yet further liberal &quot;compassion&quot;, and instead of
<br>
charging what the market will bear, I make as little profit
<br>
as possible.  The result:  the consumers stand in long lines
<br>
to get my widgits, and no one else has much incentive to 
<br>
&quot;exploit&quot; those customers!
<br>
<p>Why is the foregoing illustration unappreciated by many
<br>
who favor taxes on &quot;obscene&quot; profits?
<br>
<p>Lee
