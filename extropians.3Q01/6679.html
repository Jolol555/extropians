<p>Cool, now youre thinking.  Since we have them semi-autonomous,
<br>
we could do a ballon carry and deploy.

<p><em>&gt; A slow, silent electric-powered motor sailor could keep a camera

<p>Greg are you up to speed on the low-noise electric RCs?  The local
<br>
club has a couple guys experimenting with them.  Last I saw em they
<br>
were packing up, heading over to Mike Lorrey's place.

<p><em>&gt; I envision a clear dome on the plane's belly in which a pointable camera

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>For the first one.  4k apiece after that.  The DoD has access to
<br>
economies of scale that would blow your mind.  Their stuff is
<br>
no more expensive than commercial OTS, assuming it need not
<br>
have four 9s reliability, which these would not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I agree with Barbara that we have to worry about the people and weapons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the bad guys already have pre-positioned in autonomous action cells in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the West.
</em><br>
<p>Which is why we have the RC drones to start with: to find those
<br>
guys and guns before sending troops into harms way.  The war
<br>
gamers are all over these scenarios, and theyre about to wet their
<br>
pants with eagerness to try out all their toys developed over the last
<br>
few years.  spike
