<p><p>This seems to play into the popular mythis about cloning.  A
<br>
clone of you is NOT another you.  It is a separte individual
<br>
that happens to have the same genes.  A hundred clones would be
<br>
a hundred beings with the same genetic structure.  But in no way
<br>
would you then experience being alive in 100 different bodies. 
<br>
Is one hundred copies of your exact genetic structure worth
<br>
almost anything to you?  Why?
