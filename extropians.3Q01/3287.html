<em>&gt; Ever see the movie 'The Siege', with Denzel Washington? I thought it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty amazing since there was no reference whatsoever in the film to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fact that Denzel's character was black. As far as black/white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relations go, the film was raceless. Anybody know any other (American)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; films with such racelessness?

<p>Al Villalobos wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt; Wesley Snipes in Rising Sun (also a novel by Michael Crichton) with Sean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Connery?  I dont think the book made any reference at all to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charachter's (Snipes')race
</em><br>
<p>This is ironic.  It is true that there was little if any reference to the
<br>
black character's race.  But that is because the book was so busy discussing
<br>
Japanese racism.
<br>
<p>The Japanese felt that non-Japanese were inferior.  The Americans feared the
<br>
Japanese as different.  The American mentor who lived in Japan explained how
<br>
Japanese felt superior to Americans.  The past love affair between the
<br>
Mentor and a Japanese emphasized how she was outcast for being different,
<br>
and how he could never fit in because he was not Japanese.  In the book, the
<br>
American cops called the Japanese racist, the Japanese called the American
<br>
cops racist.  The race issue was a major concern in the book.  In real life,
<br>
Japan protested the publishing of this book.  They claimed it really was
<br>
racist against Japanese.  There was a lot of controversy about this book
<br>
either being racist itself or being about racism itself.  There was arguing
<br>
on both sides about whether it was really racist again the Japanese or
<br>
whether it was really truthful about Japanese being racist against
<br>
non-Japanese.  This argument occurred in real life about the book, and
<br>
within the book about the fictional case.
<br>
<p>(By the way, I loved this and almost anything written by Michael Crichton!)
