<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually it may be possible to escape this paradox via technology.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ever read about the Sysop Scenario?

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I personally much prefer the Santa scenario, reindeer, elves, sleigh, and

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; all.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Really, changing people's attitudes is hard work. By mentioning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; implausible magic fairy dust scenarios you're not helping.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't see what's implausible about it. It's a pretty well accepted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; future solar system scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AHOOGA! AHOOGA! Groupthink warning!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It has been considered here on this list and in Extropy, perhaps in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few sf novels, but thats it. It is 'well accepted' by a very small group
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of people, who of course spend much time talking to each other. So to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them it seems that many more people hold that view than really do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you ask a representative cross section of (say) american citizens or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectuals about the scenario, you will get mainly blank stares,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite a few laughs and some explaining to you that it must be wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because computers cannot think or similar arguments. To most people a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future just like today but with a few more toys is a well accepted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario, anything else is out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basing one's interactions with the public on what one believes to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational or likely rather than what *they* consider to be rational and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely (even if you think they are utterly wrong) will simply not work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To communicate you need to understand how to express things in other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people's realities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I understand what you're saying Anders but it seems irrelevant. If I
<br>
wait around until the general public understands what I'm talking about,
<br>
well that will be a long time most likely :-) I wasn't aware that we
<br>
were now restricted on the Extropians list to only discussing things
<br>
that the majority of the world agrees on :-) If I was talking in &quot;public&quot;
<br>
I would not of course say what I said.
<br>
<p>So, I still hold that it not implausible or wishful thinking as Eugene
<br>
would have everyone believe. It is a real possible scenario that can
<br>
be thoughtfully considered, and even worked towards.
