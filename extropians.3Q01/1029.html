<p>No, the most you can say is that you don't take seriously the claims of
<br>
those who do report finding flaws in the Matrix.
<br>
<p>The more testable, robust claims from the field of parapsychology can be so
<br>
interpreted. Obviously this science, parascience or `science' arose (like
<br>
science proper) from naive folk beliefs, many of them in retrospect
<br>
palpable misunderstandings of natural phenomena or counterintuitive
<br>
probability distributions. But the work I've occasionally cited here by,
<br>
say, the Princeton University anomalies researchers (invariably dismissed
<br>
cursorily and unread by Eliezer and others who know how the world is
<br>
*really* hinged) might be understood as evidence for a Matrix.
<br>
<p>Then there's creepy personal testimony. This is where the scientifically
<br>
minded reach for our face masks, and rightly so. Still, it was a very odd
<br>
experience when I got a lift home from a guest lecture I'd been giving and
<br>
the young woman at the wheel, who seemed to know nothing about me, casually
<br>
mentioned in response to an idle comment of mine that... well, when she was
<br>
a child/adolescent, her mother and their friends had regularly held Ouija
<br>
board seances, and following one of these events when all the ladies had
<br>
repaired to the other end of the room to take tea and scones she'd noticed
<br>
the inverted glass lift into the air from the table and hurl itself toward
<br>
the wall, where it had struck without breaking and slid down to the floor;
<br>
this was reportedly also seen by all the adults in attendance, something
<br>
her mother confirmed recently. No earthquake, no hands Ma. I dunno. If that
<br>
*is* the world we live in, things are not so simple. The Matrix or
<br>
something like it could still be Ockham's cut.
