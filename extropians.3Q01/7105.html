<em>&gt;   The New War-ld Order -  America's New War
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   By Richard Sauder, PhD

<p>Aside from the fact that the piece posted was internally inconsistent and
<br>
written in a style commonly seen on conspiracy theory web sites, I tend to
<br>
be skeptical of anything someone says if they claim to receive their
<br>
marching orders from mysterious voices (see below). Richard Saunders has
<br>
also written about UFO's, underground alien bases, and aliens (in cahoots
<br>
with the CIA no doubt) trying to control our minds.
<br>
<p>Stuff like this is unfortunate in that it makes the whole subject of
<br>
dangerous political trends appear ridiculous. Greg Burch recently posted a
<br>
message that referred derisively to &quot;the black helicopter crowd.&quot; A few
<br>
years ago I was actually visited by a BATF helicopter and several carloads
<br>
of police on the ground who entered my land without my permission and with
<br>
no search warrant. Their probable cause was that there were a couple of
<br>
shrubs growing on my land that looked like marijuana from the air; and that
<br>
I had a shed covered with a camouflage colored tarp (the reason for this was
<br>
that that particular tarp was the only one that was the size I needed when I
<br>
went to the store to buy a tarp). You don't need a conspiracy theory to
<br>
explain this. All you have to do is look at the statutes and the case law. I
<br>
think people need to be aware of the consequences of laws that give broad
<br>
powers to the police, but I hesitate to even bring up the topic for fear of
<br>
being classified with the &quot;black helicopter crowd.&quot;
<br>
<p>You don't need a CIA conspiracy theory to predict that there will be abuses
<br>
of laws that give broad powers to enforcement agencies and bureaus to
<br>
eavesdrop on private conversations. Statistically, each one of us is more
<br>
likely to suffer harm from a powerful central government with broad police
<br>
powers than from terrorists. Sadly, I don't think there's a lot any of us
<br>
can do to prevent this. The next question that comes to my mind is, what is
<br>
the best way to live under conditions where a central government has broad
<br>
police powers.

<br>
Why I wrote Underground Bases and Tunnels....
<br>
There are a number of reasons why I wrote &quot;Underground Bases and Tunnels.&quot;
<br>
To begin with, it is a book I wanted to read, but couldn't find in the
<br>
library or bookstore. So I wrote it myself! The entire subject of secret
<br>
underground bases has intrigued me ever since I first heard rumors about
<br>
them ten years ago. But I never thought I would write a book about them,
<br>
until late one night over the Holidays in 1992 I was awakened from a sound
<br>
sleep by a mysterious voice that matter-of-factly told me: &quot;The underground
<br>
bases are real....&quot; Imagine my surprise! I listened quietly as the voice
<br>
told me that indeed there are secret underground bases, with people living
<br>
and working in them, carrying out projects that the average person would be
<br>
very surprised to know about. And then the voice stopped speaking. I still
<br>
do not know whose voice I heard-- but I did subsequently go out and do a
<br>
methodical piece of research that resulted in &quot;Underground Bases and
<br>
Tunnels: What is the Government Trying to Hide?&quot;
