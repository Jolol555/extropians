I saw the Stossel program Friday night.  I always enjoy seeing the
<br>
conventional wisdom challenged, and Stossel was blazing away at most of
<br>
the environmental sacred cows.  Sometimes they have released transcripts
<br>
of Stossel's programs in the past, but this time all I could find was
<br>
a summary web page,
<br>
<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/onair/2020/stossel_010629_tamperingwithnature.html">http://abcnews.go.com/onair/2020/stossel_010629_tamperingwithnature.html</a>.
<br>
<p>As I have commented before, it's not clear to me that confrontational
<br>
tactics are that effective on these issues.  I can't help feeling that
<br>
Stossel will simply not be believed.  Even when he had scientists on
<br>
the show to back him up, viewers may assume that those experts are being
<br>
paid to take their positions.  He relied quite a bit on the former head
<br>
of Greenpeace, who now seems to have switched his views 180 degrees and
<br>
who was described as now being paid by timber companies.  This doesn't
<br>
make him look like an environmentalist who has seen the light, rather
<br>
he comes off as someone who completely lacks integrity and will say
<br>
whatever is most profitable for him at the moment.
<br>
<p>One area I thought worked well was when school kids all vehemently
<br>
insisted that air pollution was getting worse, and then Stossel showed
<br>
charts that showed major pollutants getting better.  However some of
<br>
his other charts did not work so well.
<br>
<p>In discussing global warming, he showed a chart with temperature increasing
<br>
over the past 100 years.  But then he pulled back to show it over a larger
<br>
span of several hundred years, and present temperatures were no longer
<br>
highest, things had been much higher a few hundred years ago.
<br>
<p>I don't think this is correct.  The chart's temperature axis read -32,
<br>
-34, -36 degrees down the vertical axis.  What was this a chart of?
<br>
I got the impression this was some polar region.  I think if you look at
<br>
worldwide average temperatures then the recent temperatures are unusually
<br>
high even over the past 1000 years.  This chart was up so briefly that
<br>
probably most viewers were unaware of the oddity.
<br>
<p>In another example, an activist complained about the use of recombinant
<br>
bovine growth hormone (RBGH).  She said that the U.S. was the only
<br>
industrialized country to allow its use.  Later she simplified that to say
<br>
that the U.S. was the only country which allowed it.  Stossel challenged
<br>
her and put up a quickly-scrolling list of other countries that allowed
<br>
the use of RGBH.  There were 20 or more and it made her look bad.
<br>
<p>But if you looked closely at the list, all were Third World countries.
<br>
Venezuela, Mexico, etc., all poor nations.  The United States was the only
<br>
First World country that I saw.  So in fact the activist was basically
<br>
correct in her initial statement, although the streamlined version of
<br>
the message was not right.  But I felt that Stossel was trying to snow
<br>
the viewers by putting up the list so fast that most people couldn't read
<br>
it carefully.  (I Tivo'd the show so was able to view it at my leisure.)
<br>
<p>I had a lot of other complaints too, as when Stossel would subtly
<br>
switch the question being discussed, starting from the question of
<br>
whether global warming is occuring and whether man is causing it, and
<br>
then saying no, many scientists don't agree that global warming will
<br>
be harmful.  Both statements are true: there is a consensus that warming
<br>
is occuring and that it is very likely due in part to human activities;
<br>
and there is much less consensus about the net effects of the warming,
<br>
because some will be good and some will be bad.  Stossel emphasized the
<br>
second point and let it be assumed that the disagreement covered the
<br>
other issue as well.
<br>
<p>All in all I don't know how well Stossel has helped his cause with the
<br>
show.  One interesting point is that probably a lot more people watched
<br>
it due to all the publicity gained by pulling the interviews with school
<br>
children at the last minute (interviews with other kids were substituted).
