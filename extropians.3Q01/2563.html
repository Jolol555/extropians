Today's Los Angeles Times has an editorial sounding a cautionary note
<br>
on germline engineering, and it mentions the Extropy Institute.
<br>
<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-000061697jul29.story?coll=la%2Dnews%2Dcomment">http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-000061697jul29.story?coll=la%2Dnews%2Dcomment</a>
<br>
(that link may not work after today):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Americans might be surprised to know that germline engineering is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supported not only by fringe think tanks like the Los Angeles-based
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extropy Institute (mission statement: &quot;Incubating Positive Futures&quot;)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but also by some top scientists. MIT economist Lester Thurow says
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;biotechnology is inevitably leading to a world in which plants,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animals and human beings are going to be partly man-made.&quot; James
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watson--the co-discoverer of DNA, the former head of the National
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Institutes of Health and a Nobel laureate--is the most blunt of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all. &quot;No one has the guts to say it,&quot; Watson says, but &quot;if we could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make better human beings by knowing how to add genes, why shouldn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we?&quot;
<br>
<p>It's great to see ExI rising in prominence enough to be mentioned as
<br>
one of the prominent advocates of technology, even though it is done in
<br>
a disparaging manner here.  It's also good to see respected names like
<br>
Thurow and Watson quoted as agreeing.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As another Nobel laureate, College de France genetics professor
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francois Jacob, said, techno-eugenics is troubling when its &quot;point
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is no longer to heal someone but to modify him, to mold him. ... on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no account is it for scientists to decide questions of this magnitude.&quot;
<br>
<p>I fully agree with this.  It is not for scientists to decide.  But it
<br>
is not for governments or societies to decide, either.
<br>
<p>It is for parents to decide.
<br>
<p>Only in extreme cases where the proposed changes would be clearly
<br>
detrimental to the child, tantamount to child abuse, would society be
<br>
justified in stepping in.
