This is a review from a friend.  He's given me leave to pass it along to
<br>

Subject: A.I. review - or, how Spielberg conned me out of 2.5 hours of my
<br>
life
<br>
<p><p>There is no need for a &quot;spoiler alert&quot; in this message.
<br>
<p>This is because after having seen A.I. this afternoon, Jessica and I are
<br>
finding it quite impossible to find any way to &quot;spoil&quot; this movie that
<br>
Spielberg did not do himself.  I promise you, I went into that theater not
<br>
as Stanley Kubrick's #1 fan looking to bash Spielberg, but as a movie fan
<br>
looking to enjoy a movie.  I am not a professional film critic and I stand
<br>
nothing to gain by bashing a movie.  But I decided that I had to see it in
<br>
order to give an honest review, and here it is.
<br>
<p>Put it this way - if you've seen Pinocchio, and you've seen E.T., then
<br>
imagine what the two merged together would look like and you get A.I.  For
<br>
those who wanted science fiction, it wasn't there.  For those, like me, who
<br>
wanted an exploration of the moral quandaries surrounding the development
<br>
of scientient robots, it was a serious letdown as the issue was not
<br>
explored in the least.
<br>
<p>Instead, the entire movie was about &quot;a robot boy who wanted to be made into
<br>
a real boy so his mommy would love him - and the Blue Fairy from the
<br>
Pinocchio story would make it happen.&quot;  I'm not kidding, I'm not
<br>
exaggerating.  Interspersed in the film are plenty of cheap &quot;Kodak moments&quot;
<br>
such as a silhouette against the moon a la E.T., and other ripoffs of other
<br>
movies which are not even remotely subtle.
<br>
<p>The score was awful - just plain awful.  I whispered to Jessica &quot;I wonder
<br>
who this is, it's cheesy like John Williams but it doesn't sound like his
<br>
stuff.&quot;  Sure enough, it was John Williams (though I did not know this
<br>
until the closing credits).  It was awful because of the complete lack of
<br>
seriousness in a film whose topic deserved at least a sliver of seriousness.
<br>
<p>Because the script (authored by Spielberg) was so simplistic, I imagine it
<br>
was difficult to get any serious actors to want to be in the film - for
<br>
this reason, other than Haley Joel Osment the only actors cast with any
<br>
kind of pre-existing established reputation were William Hurt and Jude
<br>
Law.  And Hurt's character was cast to the wind, leaving only Osment and
<br>
Law to carry the film.  Osment did as much as he could, but his shoulders
<br>
are not THAT broad (literally and metaphorically).
<br>
<p>The rest of the acting was as poor as the script would allow.  The mother
<br>
(Frances O'Connor) and father (Sam Robards), both previously unknown to me,
<br>
will soon vanish from my mind, for their performances were simply
<br>
incompetent.  Martin, played by some other child actor, was OK for a child
<br>
actor, which in this film made him stand out above the rest of the
<br>
supporting cast.  The surprise casting move of the movie was for a
<br>
cartoonish Einstein holograph called &quot;Dr. Know&quot;; the voiceover was done by
<br>
Robin Williams in much the same flavor as Gilbert Gottfried's annoying
<br>
voiceover in Disney's adaptation of Alladin.  And finally, the only other
<br>
character who appeared in more than one scene was the robotic teddybear
<br>
Teddy - who was essentially the Jar Jar Binks of this movie.
<br>
<p>The special effects were excellent - but as Mr. Ust says about The Phantom
<br>
Menace, &quot;See why money and lots of effects can't make a bad story
<br>
good.&quot;  All of the technical facets of the film were top-notch first-rate -
<br>
but the technicians are limited by the artistic vision of their director,
<br>
and in this movie special effects functioned as little more than eye candy.
<br>
<p>The reason why I love Kubrick films is because of the way he could make a
<br>
picture say a thousand words, and because of the way at 24 frames a second
<br>
he could give an audience a most intense catharsis (I won't say &quot;the most
<br>
intense&quot; because of my lack of knowledge of foreign film, but certainly
<br>
more intense than any other American director).  He didn't just tell a
<br>
story in his films; he taught us something important about ourselves or
<br>
about the world in which we live.  There was one reason why Kubrick had
<br>
never &quot;co-directed&quot; or given any kind of creative control of his projects
<br>
to anyone else; in the end, the finished product that was shipped out was
<br>
HIS vision - and though all of his movies are distinct, they are all
<br>
distinctly HIS.
<br>
<p>A.I. had Kubrick's name listed as a producer, and in my opinion this is a
<br>
grave blasphemy.  When Spielberg deigned to pick up where Kubrick left off,
<br>
he had a moral responsibility to the memory of Kubrick and to the body of
<br>
work that Kubrick left behind (including 2001: A Space Odyssey, which also
<br>
explores the moral issues surrounding artificial intelligence) to make the
<br>
most brilliant film of which he was capable.  At the very least, with Blade
<br>
Runner nearing its 20th anniversary I think that the least Spielberg could
<br>
have done was to try and outdo the depth that Ridley Scott provided to his
<br>
human characters as well as his replicants.
<br>
<p>On the contrary, I don't think there can be any doubt that Spielberg didn't
<br>
put the slightest effort into making a decent movie.  I haven't seen Saving
<br>
Private Ryan, but I have seen Schindler's List and Amistad and I know the
<br>
man is capable of better than this.  He was clearly coasting through the
<br>
project and looking to make a quick buck off of Kubrick's reputation.
<br>
<p>In short, on a 10 scale, Jessica rates the film a 2 and I rate it a 3.  Our
<br>
rationale for not giving it a 1 is the same: when the special effects
<br>
people put this job on their resumes we don't want anyone to think that
<br>
they did a poor job.
<br>
<p>We advise everyone to skip this at the theater, and if you have to see it -
<br>
borrow an illegal copy.  Spielberg must not make another dime off this film.
<br>
<p>Most sincerely,
<br>
<p>Dave
