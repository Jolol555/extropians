Charles &amp; Matt posted some questions regarding Bush's
<br>
authority to regulate research funding &amp; anti-cloning
<br>
legislation.
<br>
<p>I'll state my impressions from my following the discussions
<br>
in Science and some reading of the legislation.
<br>
<p>a) Someplace wrapped up in the legislation funding the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Institute of Health (or perhaps the executive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;branch powers) is some right of the President to regulate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether or not NIH gets to allocate funds to certain
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;research activities (esp. research involving the use
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of embryos).
<br>
<p>This is intertwined in the conservative agenda to not
<br>
use federal funds for abortions or any other government
<br>
activity that would involve taking a &quot;potential&quot; life,
<br>
so when the Republicans have enough power in Congress they
<br>
enact legislation allowing the imposition of such restrictions
<br>
in the hopes that when they happen to have the White House
<br>
the restrictions will be tightened.  You would have to
<br>
investigate the ammendments that get tacked onto the
<br>
appropriations bills in detail to follow the history of
<br>
this I think.
<br>
<p>b) The anti-cloning push also comes out of the conservative
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agenda, and Bush has stated that he supports this.  However,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it only recently got linked to stem cell research due to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;efforts of the Republicans in the House.  I've got
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;links to the legislation in this Nanodot article:
<br>
<p><a href="http://nanodot.org/article.pl?sid=01/08/01/1333227&mode=thread">http://nanodot.org/article.pl?sid=01/08/01/1333227&mode=thread</a>
<br>
particularly in:
<br>
<a href="http://nanodot.org/comments.pl?sid=01/08/01/1333227&pid=0#3">http://nanodot.org/comments.pl?sid=01/08/01/1333227&pid=0#3</a>
<br>
<p>Nanodot had a good reference here:
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://nanodot.org/article.pl?sid=01/04/17/1432244&mode=thread">http://nanodot.org/article.pl?sid=01/04/17/1432244&mode=thread</a>
<br>
to an article here:
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopelprint041601.html">http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopelprint041601.html</a>
<br>
which pointed out that there were significant questions as to whether
<br>
the Congress or the President had any authority to regulate reproductive
<br>
activities (and yes, it was tied into the rights to regulate
<br>
Interstate Commerce).
<br>
<p>Given how the courts seem to be leaning with the copyright and
<br>
DMCA legislation, there seems to be a slant against
<br>
&quot;individual&quot; rights.  So the likelyhood of significant
<br>
actions against clinics/scientists pursuing reproductive
<br>
cloning (and support potentially through several levels
<br>
of the judicial hierarchy) seems high.
<br>
<p>Reason Magazine has a good set of links related to the
<br>
Cloning debates here:
