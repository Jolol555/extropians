<p>Congratulations to those of you who just chased another person off of the 
<br>
extropians list.  Perhaps, if you're lucky, we'll wind up with only a few 
<br>
dozen with exact same ideas on everything.  That would be wonderful, 
<br>
wouldn't it?
<br>
<p>Frankly, I'm tired of seeing this happen.  True, it isn't often as explicit 
<br>
as this case, but I have been privy to seeing plenty of unsubscriptions 
<br>
after unnecessary verbal attacks.  And why is it...just because someone has 
<br>
a few disagreements with one aspect of your worldview?
<br>
<p>Personally, I have an opinion on virtually every thread on this list, but I 
<br>
try not to share those opinions unless I feel they add something to the 
<br>
discussion as a whole --usually they do not.  Unfortunately, I don't have a 
<br>
lot of workable ideas on changing the format of this list, or solutions to 
<br>
out and out rudeness.  I will mention, like many before me however, that I 
<br>
find such behavior juvenile, unwarranted and disgusting, and most of all, 
<br>
unnecessary.  This isn't the kind of behavior that will win us credibility 
<br>
on a public scale.  Please keep that in mind before you start posting 
<br>
vehemence.
