<em>&gt; Lets assume for the sake of argument your optimistic estimate is correct, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would mean there is one chance in 200,000 of it causing 10 trillion dollars of damage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next year, so on that basis alone we would be justified in spending 50 million every year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investigating it. Look at it another way, there is one chance in 200,000 of it killing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 200 million people next year. Thus your chances of this thing killing you next year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are better than your chances of dying in a airline crash even if you're a frequent flyer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Airline crashes don't kill anywhere near a thousand people a year yet we spend far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than 50 million a year trying to prevent them.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'M above 600 ft altitude and over 100 miles inland. I don't know
<br>
about YOU, but I expect to get through it just fine. People in glass
<br>
houses shouldn't ask others to pay for their window washing.
<br>
<p>Now, there has to be something signficantly wrong with using straight
<br>
statistics to analyse atypical events. I mean, people win the lottery
<br>
all the time, and those odds are far higher than those posited here.
<br>
<p>I think the problem is that the odds of catastrophic events like this
<br>
are predicting off of insufficient information. Some years the odds will
<br>
be higher than others, simply because events like this are not
<br>
completely random, they are systemic, so saying the odds this year are 1
<br>
in 200,000 and every year for the next million will be the same does not
<br>
reflect actual risk, but merely an ignorance of sufficient information
<br>
for accurate predictions.
