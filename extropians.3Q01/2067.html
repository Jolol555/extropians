</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; drifts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we package the warhead into identical aluminized baloon as the decoys.

</em><br>
<p>No. A conical shape will deflect a much greater amount of radar energy
<br>
when it is coming from head on than from the side, while a balloon will
<br>
have the exact same radar signature during the entire trajectory. Thus,
<br>
the sig of the warhead will increase in strength as its angle of
<br>
incidence to the radar signal increases, and decoys will be filtered out
<br>
as that occurs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The problem is that a) a balloon will have a different radar sig than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cones, and b) a balloon will have a different mass, and therefore will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, you engineer the decoys and the warhead envelope to resemble
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other as closely as possible.
</em><br>
<p>That is my point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; follow a different trajectory than the much heavier IRV. For this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not in vacuum. As soon as you see drag, it's too late to intercept,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway. Then, baloons are useless, admittedly. But they have served their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purpose, already.
</em><br>
<p>No, the ephemerides of a heavy warhead versus a light decoy will show
<br>
themselves by midcourse. A Missile doesn't follow a circular orbit, it
<br>
is elliptical, and thus mass differences will show the greatest effect
<br>
at the apogee point in the trajectory, long before it hits air.
<br>
<p>The only way to mask this inherent disadvantage of a decoy until as late
<br>
as possible is to delay deployment of warheads and decoys until after
<br>
apogee and shortly before reentry. This increases the vulnerability of
<br>
all warheads on the bus to being interdicted by a single laser pulse
<br>
(those that blow up will damage their fellows, and induce unrecoverable
<br>
spin/yaw/roll rates to the bus and its payload. Releasing the unstable
<br>
warheads from such a situation simply guarantees their debris as they
<br>
burn up will be dispersed over a wider area...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason, the best 'decoy' is another IRV. You might as well put a bomb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought the warheads were MIRVed already? Let's say 5% the real Mc Coy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 95% decoys?
</em><br>
<p>Again: What is the point of using decoys? A really effective decoy will
<br>
have all the same characteristics of a real IRV with a real warhead in
<br>
it. Especially if nukes are as cheap as John claims they are, there is
<br>
no economical reason why you should waste a good IRV with no warhead:
<br>
put a nuke in the damn thing.
<br>
<p>And: warheads are not MIRV'd, missiles are. A MIRV'd missile has
<br>
multiple warheads, each in its own IRV, all on a bus in the nose,
<br>
generally arranged in in circular clusters of either 3,5,7, or 10
<br>
warheads, depending on the missile. A fully armed missile can't carry
<br>
more mass than it's designed to throw in warheads without giving away
<br>
that it's carrying more mass in its trajectory, so you need to remove a
<br>
real warhead to put in one or more decoys, so you are cutting in on the
<br>
effectiveness of your missile immediately the first time you decide to
<br>
even use decoys. Then you are dealing with a 'minefield' type problem:
<br>
radars / IR devices can track x + d 'warheads' separating from the MIRV
<br>
bus, therefore, the system knows that of the total bogies, where d are
<br>
the number of decoys and x is the number of warheads, and where x + n
<br>
equals the actual carrying capacity of the bus. n * M(x) = d * M(d),
<br>
i.e. how many decoys mass as much as one warhead (as well as how many
<br>
can take up one warhead slot on the bus.
<br>
<p>It follows that the most effective decoy will occur when M(x) = M(d),
<br>
and therefore, since they are of equal mass, one must assess the
<br>
strategic value of that mass. An actual warhead has far more effective
<br>
utilization efficiency of that mass than a mere decoy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the round object is a poor reentry vehicle. It slows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You don't have to be spherical at/during reentry, you only have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spherical during the ballistic arc outside of the atmosphere.
</em><br>
<p>SO what if you put a round envelope around a conical IRV? It's the mass
<br>
that counts. 
<br>
<p>This isn't really difficult to understand: its why sabots are so
<br>
effective as projectiles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; down to subsonic too easily, the cone is designed to reenter and hit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the target at a high supersonic velocity, reducing airtime. If it goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; subsonic, then the IRV can be intercepted much easier with simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; machine guns.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What it shows is that decoys are irrelevant as a FUD strategy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think I'm giving up now.
</em><br>
<p>This was dealing with John's inane notion of having all IRV be
<br>
spherical.
