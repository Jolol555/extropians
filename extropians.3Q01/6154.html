<em>&gt; As some of my posts to the list over the years have shown one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; big problems I think we will face in the future is &quot;trustability&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do you trust that you will not be betrayed and/or damaged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by other entities whose inner workings you cannot verify.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, in memory of today's sad events I would like to challenge the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of the Extropian community to think long and hard about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what ways might be used to create innovative solutions to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism that would increase trustability and personal security
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without imposing restrictions on freedoms (in other words, please,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please lets not make it a debate about guns).
</em><br>
<p>One of the better solutions I've heard today is to train the stewards
<br>
in security.  Give them batons and tasers, normally concealed under
<br>
their uniforms (don't want to *look* threatening), and make sure they
<br>
know how to use them.  The number of ways a passenger-turned-terrorist
<br>
can try to take over a plane is limited; most of them can probably be
<br>
programmed into simulators for training against.  Main objective is to
<br>
prevent hijacking, but this might also be useful day-to-day in cases of
<br>
severe air rage.
<br>
<p>Once one airline does this, you wouldn't even have to legislate it.
<br>
Just run a few (probably tasteless) ads on this - say, &quot;As a special
<br>
offer to those brave souls flying our competition, we offer to pay for
<br>
one life insurance quote per flight.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But, people on the list have discussed before such things as ships
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with atomic bombs entering major harbors.  And of course I'm highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aware of the damage that can be done by small bioweapons that are capable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of spreading themselves.  Today's events apparently were in essence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predicted in a novel (perhaps by Tom Clancey?) a few years ago
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involving a plane being crashed into the capitol building.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why haven't we done anything about it?  Can we come up with good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological solutions?
</em><br>
<p>That orbital colony idea is looking better and better all the time...
