<em>&gt; For those of you who did not see it last night, PBS had a program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on P.O.V. titled &quot;Life and Debt&quot; about the havoc being caused in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jamaica by &quot;globalization&quot; and &quot;free trade&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I first started watching it I thought to myself --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;oh here we go, yet another green agenda program&quot; but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as time went by, I found myself re-thinking the issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What became apparent from the program is how a system seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have come into existence that is really set up to screw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the third world countries.
</em><br>
<p>It does seem that way, especially if you base your opinions only on the
<br>
arguments of one side.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What happens is a country comes to the IMF for a loan.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMF says ok, but the conditions are that you have to lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any barriers to imports (because free trade is a good thing).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The country says ok.  So what happens is in comes a flood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of foreign goods, esp. U.S. food, produced by corporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agri-business.  These come in at prices lower than foods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be produced domestically and as a result the Jamaican
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farmers are driven out of business.  At first I found myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking -- &quot;So what? The consumers are getting the benefits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of lower food prices.&quot; -- but then I realized the problem --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S. exports are being produced with very large government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsidies.
</em><br>
<p>US farm subsidies are actually quite low at the moment, only a few
<br>
billion for a multi-hundred billion dollar industry. They don't
<br>
subsidize low prices either, they are used to prop up prices. If we
<br>
ended subsidies entirely, US food prices would be far lower.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If that wasn't bad enough, the IMF loans to Jamaica are at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outrageous rates (19% was quoted) and there are clauses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the contracts that Jamaica cannot loan the money out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at a lower rate to its farmers (so they could in theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modernize their farms with machinery to compete effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against American imports).  So the system is setup to *keep*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a 3rd world country in that position.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this does seem inequitable, unless of course you consider the
<br>
record of third world countries in defaulting on loans, late in
<br>
payments, etc. Extending credit to such countries is like giving a
<br>
platinum card to a recovering shopaholic who lives on welfare: i.e. a
<br>
really really dumb idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then to top it all off, Jamaica had a preferential relationship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Britian with regard to the marketing of its banana crop.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apparently corporate banana growers who have large farms in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Latin/South America got President Clinton to challenge this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under the WTO rules and they won the case, so Britian had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to open up the market (perhaps some slight benefit for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; British consumers, terrible for Jamaican banana planation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workers and owners who see demand fall).  This change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't benefit any U.S. farmers, only the corporations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who own the offshore plantations.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but I don't seen anyone suing Jamaica in the WTO over the
<br>
marijuana crop, which is far higher in value than the banana crop. Keep
<br>
in mind also that native jamaicans don't own the banana plantations in
<br>
Jamaica either, they are owned by Brits.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, I'm sure there are other sides to the story but it sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made me wonder if the corporate Agribusiness interests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weren't influencing the IMF (and other bank) policies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently to slant the playing field in their direction.
</em><br>
<p>Frankly, nothing the IMF does surprises me. They seem to function with
<br>
an economic rule book that is far different from that used by anyone
<br>
else and is strictly written to benefit one group only: international
<br>
bankers. For instance, the US 1.35 trillion buck tax break, which will
<br>
actually cost us about 1.8 trillion due to synergistic effects, the IMF
<br>
projects is actually gonna cost us something like $3 trillion. Just how
<br>
they calculate that they do not say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For sure in my mind I don't think the IMF or the President
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be demanding that third world countries eliminate import tariffs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or that preferential trade relationships must be ended while the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Europe are subsidizing agriculture to the degree that they do.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly not europe, but the US really doesn't subsidize anywhere near
<br>
the level they do, and where we do, it is to prop prices up, not keep
<br>
them down.
