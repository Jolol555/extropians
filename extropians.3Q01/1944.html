<em>&gt; &gt; Here's the section relevant to lotteries:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;...The Imbens research reinforces an earlier study by H. Roy Kaplan, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sociologist now with the National Conference for Community &amp; Justice in Tampa,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Fla. In a 1985 paper in the Journal of the Institute of Socioeconomic Studies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Kaplan found that one-fourth of the big winners and their spouses stopped working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; within a year of their winning....&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; May we assume that right off in the United States, about one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fourth of the people would stop working within a year?  Are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the buyers of lottery tickets typical?  I'm guessing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It frankly surprises me that the answer is as low as one-fourth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps after a few years, the proportion becomes greater.  On
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other hand, some of those people will go start new businesses;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still the number that would is probably negligible.
</em><br>
<p>THese conclusions also discount the fact that managing a multi-million
<br>
dollar fortune can become a full time job if the individual owner wishes
<br>
to take charge of their own money.
<br>
<p>All of this is actually quite meaningless to the original point of
<br>
debate. Do people who inherit large fortunes or win them by lottery or
<br>
court judgement wind up producing a greater benefit to society? The
<br>
studies cited seem to put a value judgement on activity, asserting or
<br>
implying that one is only being a benefit to society when one is
<br>
exerting physical labor.
<br>
<p>Wealth is a big responsibility, and properly managing it can create a
<br>
greater good to society in the end very easily. For example, simply
<br>
looking at it from a tax perspective, lets say I'm a carpenter making
<br>
$35,000 a year when I win a $2 million lottery (after taxes are paid on
<br>
the prize). Making $35k, I am paying some $5-7k in income taxes. If I
<br>
simply stick my $2 mil in, say, bonds or rather secure mutual funds
<br>
which may yield between 7-18% annually, which results in $140k-360k
<br>
annually in capital gains income, which I'd pay something like $50k-120k
<br>
in taxes. All told, I'd be generating $55-127k in taxes for the
<br>
government. 
<br>
<p>If instead I quit my carpentry job and studied up on investing, I could
<br>
increase my annual return to between 20-40% annually, generating twice
<br>
as much money in taxes, and thus benefitting society twice as much by
<br>
'not working' as by 'working'.
