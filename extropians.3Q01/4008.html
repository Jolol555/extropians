I think I've mentioned on this list before that my ideal house would contain
<br>
a garden room capable of providing for most of the nutritional needs of the
<br>
occupants while recycling metabolic by-products as well as other organic
<br>
waste. Here's an interesting invention that's a step in the direction of
<br>
making this possible.

<p>Robot &quot;Farmers&quot; Revolutionize Agriculture?
<br>
by Judy Siegel, The Jerusalem Post, September 29, 1999
<br>
<p><p>Israeli-developed robots that tirelessly tend hydroponically grown organic
<br>
vegetables cultivated in standard metal shipping containers promise to
<br>
revolutionize agriculture from Africa to Alaska. Called Grow-Tech 2000, the
<br>
integrated systems are stackable and self-contained, and they can replace
<br>
open-field frames, says their inventor, Lior Hessel.
<br>
<p><p>The 31-year-old Technion graduate in Agricultural Engineering and Management
<br>
has filed for patents in the US and Israel and expects the first Grow-Tech
<br>
2000 to be on the market within a year.
<br>
<p>His prototype, at the OrganiTECH Technion entrepreneurial incubator, has
<br>
shown that 500 heads of lettuce can be produced in a single container.
<br>
<p>The system is environmentally friendly, using an absolute minimum of water,
<br>
producing oxygen instead of toxic gases from pesticides, and needing merely
<br>
to be plugged into a power source.
<br>
<p>The robots monitor the environment, keeping the oxygen, artificial light,
<br>
carbon dioxide, humidity, temperature, mineral levels, and other factors at
<br>
optimum levels.
<br>
<p>&quot;Dozens of lettuce varieties, plus innumerable other vegetables, like
<br>
cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, onion, garlic, and herbs can be cultivated
<br>
in Grow-Tech 2000. The next step is to grow hormone and chemical-free
<br>
strawberries, tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers,&quot; Hessel said.
<br>
<p>Bushes and even trees laden with fruit could follow. The demand for organic
<br>
produce has skyrocketed in the developed world. In the US alone, the market
<br>
for naturally grown products jumped by 30 percent between 1996 and 1997. Of
<br>
7.5 billion heads of lettuce eaten in the US each year, 10 percent are
<br>
organically grown.
<br>
<p>&quot;I predict that conventional agriculture will be finished in Israel in a
<br>
decade. There just isn't enough water, and fields will be covered over with
<br>
housing. What could remain are organic farms like these systems and the
<br>
export of know-how like ours,&quot; said Hessel. He first conceived the idea
<br>
several years ago, but has been working on the project since last summer.
<br>
<p>The Technion industrial incubator received seed money from the Chief
<br>
Scientist's Office of the Ministry of Industry and Trade and is now
<br>
considering offers for investors and strategic partners from Israel and
<br>
abroad. Hessel expects the company, which now has six professional staffers,
<br>
to have hundreds of workers within a year.
<br>
<p>&quot;The applications are endless,&quot; Hessel said. &quot;We believe we can grow highly
<br>
pure raw materials for the pharmaceutical industry. We also can solve the
<br>
problem of insects in leafy vegetables for religious Jews whose glatt kosher
<br>
standards demand a complete absence of pests. Also, today large amounts of
<br>
pesticides are used, but this is not healthy.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hessel doesn't envisage many ordinary people having a self-contained farm in
<br>
their garden, but he does believe that the &quot;growing machines&quot; could be
<br>
located at retail establishments, such as supermarkets, restaurants, and
<br>
fast-food places, as well as at distribution commissaries for chain stores.
