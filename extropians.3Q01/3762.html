<p>Though I think that this is more a matter of focus. I've known many high
<br>
IQ people, and generally they display very good sense about decisions
<br>
*when they are giving it attention*, but if they are distracted by
<br>
thinking about something else, there seems to be less so. My cousin
<br>
Catherine, for example, who went to Johns Hopkins University at age 16,
<br>
with an IQ higher than me, had a VERY poor driving record for a number
<br>
of years, totalled several cars simply from not paying attention to her
<br>
driving, distracted by abstract thoughts, but is today one of the most
<br>
sensible people I know.
<br>
<p>I don't know if several years of touring with the Dead that did it.
