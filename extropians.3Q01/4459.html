</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok, so fix that... end of problem. But one thing about that bothers me. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some of my best drawings have been done whilst in the grip of despair. It

</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminate its artistic benefits.
</em><br>
<p>But isn't the artistic benefits due to the detachedmind-set rather than
<br>
the depression? So it would be a good idea to try to find ways of
<br>
recreating the mindset without the depression, or perhaps have a
<br>
&quot;controlled depression&quot; that one deliberately indulges in. 
<br>
<p>(In a similar manner, but less dramatic, I get better at set theory when
<br>
I have a cold, for some odd reason. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How do we minimise the dangers, but allow for the benefits to be explored?
</em><br>
<p>I think that we need a deeper understanding of the mind in order to
<br>
truly reap the benefits of immortality. Being able to fix depression is
<br>
just a first order thing; we also want second order adjustments so that
<br>
the amount of emotions, creativity and unbalanced states become optimal
<br>
for human flourishing. I think that is a very complex problem, with many
<br>
individual solutions. Most likely there isn't any general solution, but
<br>
everybody has to design their own palette of mental states - it is
<br>
integral to the automorphing process we are performing as transhumans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The madness loop is harder to define, let alone solve. It is hard to see 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how circular memes could be solved for, but emotional frames of mind that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are brought about by certain mixes of hormones could be. I can imagine a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guardian angel program watching hormonal levels (the hormones would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated of course) and rebalancing them forcibly if they got stuck in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous loop that lasted too long.
</em><br>
<p>In one of my roleplaying settings  had a world where mental states could
<br>
be redefined fairly easily. Hence addictions and loops were a common
<br>
danger. The local society solved it by having &quot;The Psych Police&quot;, a
<br>
force of psychodesigners that regulary audition citizens, temporarily
<br>
putting them into a series of standardized rational mindsets so that
<br>
they can judge if they want to continue their lives as they did before
<br>
or switch to some more suitable mindset.
