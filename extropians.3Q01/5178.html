<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I liked this test much more that the WSPQ, as it is much more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; comprehensive.  I am a: Economic Left/Right: 2.50 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Authoritarian/Libertarian: -5.49; in other words, I am (as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I knew) a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; slightly right-wing libertarian --two points to the right, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and five up from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the bottom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I couldn't take this test!  I had to give up after only four 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here they are:  (for each, your only choices are strongly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree, agree,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree, and strongly disagree)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. If globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, Jesus!  The assumption is that the interests of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trans-national
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations are antithetical to those of humanity!  Good grief!  Was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the WSPQ (World's Shortest Political Quiz) this loaded, and I simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't recognize it because I'm a libertarian?  This is scary!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. I'd always support my country, whether it was right or wrong. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And what does **support** mean?  Defend physically, or refuse to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticize?  Clearly the answer that the test tries very, very hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get out of one is &quot;disagree&quot;, or &quot;disagree strongly&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. No one chooses their country of birth, so it's absurd to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proud of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absurd?  While this question isn't as absurd as the first two,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is hardly the right word here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. Our nation has many unique virtues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps not such a bad question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6. Jews surely have to take some of the responsibility for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their persecution over the past 2000 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So how can one possibly answer that if he or she believes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Jews must take a small share of the responsibility,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say five or ten percent?  Why, one must then *agree*, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's what the word &quot;some&quot; means.  But then one is immediately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implicated, (or self-implicated, depending on one's temperament)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as an anti-Semite.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6. The growing fusion between information and entertainment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a worrying contribution to the public's shrinking attention span. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So does &quot;worrying&quot; mean that one wishes to regulate it?  Luckily,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I gave up on this quiz two questions back, and don't have to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seriously:  I do *not* remember anyone complaining about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tendentiousness of the questions on the former quizzes.  PLEASE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say so if you *did* have any problem with those earlier quizzes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I agree, those questions were highly loaded. I was gritting my teeth the
<br>
whole time seeing what they were implicating behind the questions, but not
<br>
given a way to answer that I felt reflected my true beliefs.
