<em>&gt; Have you added science to your list of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useless hypotheses?
</em><br>
<p>Hi Harvey!
<br>
Nice to see you still contribute your special brand of incisive analysis to
<br>
the list.
<br>
<p>No, I have definitely NOT added science to the list of useless hypotheses, and
<br>
do not intend ever to do so. Science (besides being my first cognitive love)
<br>
appears to me the only real prospect humanity has of escaping impending
<br>
societal disintegration at the hands of those who oppose reason and resist
<br>
empirical evidence. Signs of this impending societal disintegration are the
<br>
popularity of preposterous &quot;reparations&quot; schemes and the irrational dismissal
<br>
of ubiquitous misandry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You seem to be finding more and more ways to come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusions while bypassing critical thinking, scientific method, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like.  You almost seem to have the mystical expectation that &quot;truth&quot; will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just be known to you, and that attempts to find the truth will fail.
</em><br>
<p>Operative word being &quot;seem.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You sometimes seem concerned that people miss your points.  I think this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because nobody can understand what you are talking about.  The above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentences seem to be more like a religious stream-of-consciousness rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a discussion with someone else.  You seem to be referencing implied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts with your words that only you seem to know about.  They are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explicitly included in your postings.
</em><br>
<p>Operative word being &quot;seem.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps the word &quot;mind&quot; obscures the issue, because this word can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interpreted in more than one way. So I say parts of the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seek control, and as the brain comes to recognize and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; acknowledge the unity of reality, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understands that control is an illusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To be honest, I cannot fathom your reality where you experience direct truth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without thought, consciousness or mind.  It is always interesting to read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your posts, but I have the constant feeling that I must be missing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something.  Do you have a reference for your belief system, or a webpage, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a name for the world-view you espouse?
</em><br>
<p>No, no, no... not &quot;direct truth&quot; -- rather direct _experience_. It has nothing
<br>
whatsoever to do with belief.
<br>
A name for it?? How 'bout existence. Yeah, that's it... The name of my
<br>
world-view is the scientific study of existence (with no capital &quot;e&quot;).
<br>
<p>©¿©¬
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, and ego.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
