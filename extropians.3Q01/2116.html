<br>
<p><em>&gt;I know that I some of my emails might seem to come off as a rant, sorry if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it seems that way. Im not trying to glue my feet on a soapbox, its just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really hard for me to divorce myself from these concepts and not have them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;affect me on a very primal level. I will say I am still refining my views
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and still have a lot of work to do on them, so I dont have answers to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the questions your stating quiet yet. They do point me into good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;directions to explore and get tied down and I thank you for that.
</em><br>
<p>Thank you for those kind words.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I do think law and morality are 2 different things. Law &quot;should&quot; embody
</em><br>
<em>&gt;morality perfectly (in a perfect world), but that people still would have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right to choose to do immoral things as long as it didnt violate others
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights (perfect definition to be defined some time in the future as well).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The science of law has the burden to uncover the structure that the law
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should take, but they cant very well do their job until the framework for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;objective morality is fleshed out. I think HUGE strides have been made in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;objective philosophy, but the prerequisites for building it wasnt availible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;till Rand nailed down some basic issues here recently. Now that some basics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can be discerned, the field will march forward and the proofs and answers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will come.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Im man enough to admit that I cant lay out the entire argument in detail, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Im
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not a philosophy major, but I can spot where philosophy crosses a few lines
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the sand that I have worked out. I can say with my present level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge that one principle that has yet to be proven wrong is: &quot;No force
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is to be initiated on another person&quot;. Keep in mind the context, force can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be used for defence. Fraud does count as an indirect use of force. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sounds to me like a wonderful concept. I can imagine such a world where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;force is banished. This is why taxes are wrong, and may be a very good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;boundary to put on a government.
</em><br>
<p>Look, Jerry, my head is spinning from reading from Daniel's posts... which 
<br>
is *good*. I've asked some deliberately hard questions and he's made a 
<br>
mighty effort at answering them. I also appreciate *your* efforts above. I'm 
<br>
tempted to come out with a whole new batch of questions such as about how 
<br>
moral properties can be &quot;objective&quot;. However, I'll stop here for now. I hope 
<br>
I've said enough to make the point that there are difficult issues 
<br>
underlying some of these Randian principles, etc, and more issues come up as 
<br>
you delve - and that the answers may not be obvious.
<br>
<p>For my own part, if people like you and Daniel are giving me their answers 
<br>
in good faith I'll naturally think about them, even if I think (as I do) 
<br>
that I can see some problems.
<br>
<p>Best wishes
<br>
<p>Russell
