<p>Huh?  Most humans rely on experience (so they don't have to think
<br>
about what they &quot;should&quot; do at the time when they need to do it).
<br>
Most experience comes from trying things yourself or being told
<br>
that thus and so works for someone else.  Rarely do people rely
<br>
on good scientific literature.  More likely they rely on the
<br>
popular press which is distilling what we have learned into
<br>
sound bites.
<br>
<p>Now, in the future, as scientific literature hopefully becomes freer
<br>
*and* as it becomes directly accessible by our brains, then we will
<br>
be able to think things out carefully backreferencing to the scientific
<br>
literature as nessary.  And that will be a marvelous day indeed.
