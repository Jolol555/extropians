<em>&gt; &gt;BTW, regarding the question of the historical burden of slavery, I like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;say that the current cost in the U.S. of slavery is the present value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;price of 40 acres and a mule in 1865.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which, at first glance, may seem like a decent-sized chunk of dough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However I assume that it was only freed black men living during 1865 who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were supposed to get that bounty.  Assuming that group numbered ~600,000 at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time, dividing their share amongst their millions of present day black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decendants would amount to about 40 cents and a pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game each.
</em><br>
<p>A couple food stamps and a bottle of ripple.
<br>
<p>Well, farmland runs between $20-$500 an acre, generally, and you can buy
<br>
a mule for about $200 or less, so this prices out at $1000-$20,200 in
<br>
current dollars.
<br>
<p>Why does this seem like so little? Well, slaves didn't necessarily get
<br>
paid 'nothing'. They did get free food and lodging, as well as health
<br>
care (the mastuh didn't wanna lose the value of his stock) and clothing.
<br>
In return, their productivity was generally worse than that of a paid
<br>
employee.
<br>
<p>The purpose of the '40 acres and a mule' settlement was an attempt to
<br>
make instant citizens out of the freed slaves, i.e. landed gentry, which
<br>
was naively thought to be all that was needed to make a man into a
<br>
thoughtful and concerned citizen.
<br>
<p>Now, there is still a group that DIDN'T get even this much
<br>
consideration: escaped and previously freed slaves didn't qualify under
<br>
this settlement, yet they certainly deserve a settlement as well.
