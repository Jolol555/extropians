From: &quot;Miriam English&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:miriam@werple.net.au?Subject=Re:%20life%20extension%20advocacy%20plans%20(fear%20of%20Tithonus)%20--&gt;%20%20%20worryingabout%20the%20brain&In-Reply-To=&lt;0bc901c10769$13d57000$965c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">miriam@werple.net.au</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; I am a regime of thought patterns and memories, a set of actions performed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My body (including the physical brain) has only the most tenuous and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coincidental connection with that. My body is one of the things that helps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide the illusion of continuity, but it has little to do with my feeling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I am me.
</em><br>
<p>Of course you can think of yourself any way you like (absurd for me to think
<br>
of meddling with your self-image), and to a cognitive neuroscientist, you are
<br>
also an enteric nervous system, without which you could not feel as you do. If
<br>
you want to know how it feels to really dissociate your thought patterns from
<br>
your body, eat a bunch of LSD and get back to me (assuming you haven't just
<br>
done that ô¿ô ). The illusion of continuity is one of the persistent thought
<br>
patterns interfering with the recognition and acknowledgment of the part
<br>
hormones (as one example of how bodily functions affect thinking) play in
<br>
deciding which actions you perform.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no continuous me -- just the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illusion of it maintained by my memories of what I did and felt on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preceding day.
</em><br>
<p>That is exactly the case, as pointed out over five thousand years ago in
<br>
ancient texts (Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, among others). Sometimes it does
<br>
help to consult the archives, in this case, some very old archives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If my biological self died in her sleep one night and next day my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downloaded self awoke, then in what way have I not continued? I would still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember what went before in exactly the same way I do each morning of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological life.
</em><br>
<p>Right, except that your biological life has a body attached to it, and that
<br>
body creates millions of sensory inputs. Without a body, you wouldn't need to
<br>
sleep, and so you'd not need to go through the routine of awakening each
<br>
morning. That feeling would be gone. In addition, most people can't stand more
<br>
than a few hours of sensory deprivation. If the &quot;copy&quot; does not have an
<br>
identically replicated body attached to it, you'll feel the difference. If the
<br>
&quot;copy&quot; has an identically replicated body attached to it, then it's more than
<br>
an &quot;upload&quot; -- it's an exact duplicate organism as well as a cognitive twin --
<br>
an extremely difficult item to create.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
