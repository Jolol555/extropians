<br>
<p>Good point, Damien, and I understood the friendly
<br>
spirit of the post, but I'll just emerge from lurking
<br>
to raise a few points, probably not worth raising:
<br>
<p>[] It's a **national anthem**, it's **supposed** to be
<br>
patriotic. Compare it to other anthems written more
<br>
than a hundred years ago.
<br>
<p>I particularly like England's:
<br>
<p>&quot;O Lord our God arise,
<br>
Scatter her enemies
<br>
And make them fall;
<br>
Confound their politics,
<br>
Frustrate their knavish tricks,
<br>
On Thee our hopes we fix,
<br>
God save us all!&quot;
<br>
<p>*Excellent!!*
<br>
<p>For the sake of this post, I looked up the lyrics to
<br>
&quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;, but couldn't find anything
<br>
quite so jingoistic there. (Rats!) Just stuff like
<br>
<p>&quot;Shou'd foreign foe e'er sight our coast, 
<br>
Or dare a foot to land, 
<br>
We'll rouse to arms like sires of yore 
<br>
To guard our native strand..&quot;
<br>
<p>Which is pretty tame compared to &quot;Confound their
<br>
politics; frustrate their knavish tricks...&quot;! I'll bet
<br>
&quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; was written much more
<br>
recently.
<br>
<p>[] Since I was a kid, there have been those who want
<br>
to change our national anthem to the less jingoistic
<br>
&quot;America&quot; (&quot;Oh beautiful, for spacious skies, for
<br>
amber waves of grain...&quot;), but most still like &quot;The
<br>
Star Spangled Banner&quot;, despite its flaws.
<br>
<p>[] As has been pointed out, most Americans only know
<br>
the first verse, and if it wasn't a tradition of
<br>
belting it out at baseball games, I doubt 10% of the
<br>
population would know even that much.
<br>
<p>[] Most of our &quot;patriotic&quot; activities are inevitably
<br>
accompanied by sly humor and irony. Once, while
<br>
watching Independence Day fireworks, I observed a
<br>
group of Americans belting out Bruce Springsteen's
<br>
&quot;Born in the USA&quot;; not just the refrain, but most of
<br>
the lyrics. The singers were clearly aware of the
<br>
irony, as were most of the people around, and everyone
<br>
thought it a great joke. This was not an isolated
<br>
occurance, but typical. Another example: every Fourth
<br>
of July parade I've seen in three years featured Elvis
<br>
impersonaters. What I'm saying is, although generally
<br>
patriotic, Americans are reluctant to let patriotic
<br>
displays go unaccompanied by self-effacing humor and
<br>
wierdness, almost as if they would be uncomfortable
<br>
otherwise. This is not recent, either. The custom of
<br>
having &quot;Shriners&quot; (a wacky fez-wearing American branch
<br>
of Freemasonry) ride around in little cars blowing
<br>
kazoos during Independence Day parades goes back many
<br>
decades. Compare this to Russian May Day parades, in
<br>
which tanks and ballistic missiles are common fare.
<br>
<p>[] Back to the issue of anthems, our State anthems are
<br>
often equally interesting. Quite a few of our state
<br>
anthems still harken back to the American Civil War,
<br>
referring to the valor of our troops in blue or gray,
<br>
depending on the state.
<br>
<p>A number of years ago, there was a movement in Oregon
<br>
to change it's anthem to the classic party song &quot;Louie
<br>
Louie&quot;. (The song is said to have originated there.)
<br>
The movement came close to succeeding, and the song is
<br>
still treated by many as an &quot;unofficial&quot; anthem of
<br>
Oregon.
<br>
<p>This reminds me a little of the status of &quot;Waltzing
<br>
Matilda&quot;, although you would be the expert on the real
<br>
status of that song in Australian culture. However, I
<br>
take that as a sign that we're all that different.
<br>
<p>When Canada created the new territory of Nunavut out
<br>
of what used to be the eastern Northwest Territories,
<br>
there was a referendum on what the *rest* of the
<br>
Northwest Territories should be called afterwards.
<br>
Keeping the name &quot;Northwest Territories&quot; won, but a
<br>
sizable contingent voted for the alternative of
<br>
renaming the area &quot;Bob&quot;. The Canadians aren't that
<br>
different, either.
<br>
<p>Alas, since we Americans have 270 million people, vast
<br>
resources, a remarkably successful economy, and the
<br>
power that comes with that, we must accept being a
<br>
target of ribbing by our philosophical cousins in more
<br>
sparsely populated parts of the English-speaking
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>I'm sure we deserve most of it, too.
