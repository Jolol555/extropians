I tend to believe that eventually an AI would need to swallow 
<br>
the OS of the system on which it was implemented.  That's why 
<br>
Linux is a better choice.  Or *BSD.  Or something else, nearly 
<br>
anything else, that had source code available AND mutable AND 
<br>
redistributable.  It would require a much higher level AI to 
<br>
swallow a binary OS, and the development would be much more 
<br>
difficult in the absence of any OS.  I really doubt that any 
<br>
general purpose AI will be developed on special purpose 
<br>
hardware.  After it has been developed, it may decide that for 
<br>
some functions specialized hardware is superior, despite the 
<br>
higher cost.  Or it might not (outside of sensory modules, etc). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since at the most recent Linux World conf. I saw a plug-in 
<br>
board with a plug in 25GB disk card (combined price ~ $700), and 
<br>
the cpu was a 2 GHz chip and the boards could be connected with 
<br>
a ethernet, and run as a Beowulf complex.  You could, in 
<br>
principle, fit as many into your computer as you had slots for 
<br>
(and your power supply would support).  That's NOW.  That's on 
<br>
the market today.  I feel relatively certain that when the 
<br>
software is ready, hardware won't be the problem.
<br>
<p>Of course, it would be a bit expensive... at today's prices.  To 
<br>
take a wild fling:  Say you have one tower box with four free 
<br>
slots, that you fill this way.  That's $2000 + 4 * $700 ~ 
<br>
$5,000.  Now this isn't really enough, so say you connect five 
<br>
of these together.  $25,000.  That's a good starter system.  And 
<br>
the OS for this would be Linux.  I couldn't put a good price 
<br>
estimate on what it would cost to do this with Windows, but 
<br>
since that's 25 separate cpu's I think it would probably about 
<br>
double the cost.  Or more.  And for a better system one would 
<br>
want to cluster five of these groups together... etc.
<br>
<p>Well, today's too early to start buying the hardware.  Moore's 
<br>
law says do as much as is feasible before buying the hardware. 
<br>
If I had gotten far enough, I'd spring for the basic Tower 
<br>
($5,000).  That would let me start working on the main thread 
<br>
dependency issues, etc.  By the time I was ready to proceed, 
<br>
hareware will probably have changed enough that it would be 
<br>
better to start over on new hardware.  But Linux ports easily, 
<br>
so that's no problem.  On the 5X5 the software would probably 
<br>
become sophisticated enough to swallow the OS, so one would need 
<br>
to be sufficiently convincing to cause it to hold off until one 
<br>
could add at least a second 5X5 module.  Then it should 
<br>
understand that 5X5's could be added or removed, and design 
<br>
itself accordingly.
<br>
<p>If I project this year's trends forwards (cpu speeds doubled, 
<br>
prices fell a tiny bit) then in a couple of years one should be 
<br>
able to get a 5X5 that was 4 times as powerful for around 
<br>
$15,000.  (Actually, it would do better than that.  Multiple 
<br>
CPUs don't scale nicely in capacity.  It depends on the problem 
<br>
mix, but generally you're doing quite well if you get a 50% 
<br>
bonus by adding the second one.  So you gain quite a lot more by 
<br>
using faster CPUs than by using more of them.)
<br>
<p>And do remember that an AI won't need to be as busy at the 
<br>
autonomic tasks as we are.  I've seen an estimate that 80% of 
<br>
our brain is devoted to tasks like maintaining muscle tension, 
<br>
processing food, monitoring sugar levels, etc.  I don't know how 
<br>
reliable the estimate was, but current hardware doesn't need 
<br>
much of that kind of effort.  So a much less computational 
<br>
intensive AI would be needed to achieve the same results.  And 
<br>
there's also the question of how efficient our thought processes 
<br>
are.  I don't know of any way to answer this, but there may be a 
<br>
lot of room for improvement.  In fact, we may have already 
<br>
designed a bunch of improvements that just don't happen to work 
<br>
very easily with a neural net.  (Symbolic logic, e.g.)  We can 
<br>
&quot;understand&quot; them, but they sure aren't native to us, so we &quot;run 
<br>
them under emulation&quot;.  That's always slow!
<br>
<p>So I don't see hardware as being the problem (though if it takes 
<br>
the 125 node cluster to do the job, affording it might be).  But 
<br>
notice that this scenario assumes that one is starting for here 
<br>
and now.  And it requires an OS be present that can BE swallowed 
<br>
by the AI, without it being dismembered by lawyers.  And it 
<br>
requires that the OS be copyable, without the AI being 
<br>
dismembered by lawyers.  Etc.  If you expect that the eventual 
<br>
software will be sold, then one of the BSD variations should 
<br>
probably be your starting platform, but that feels to me like 
<br>
slavery.  It's one thing to ask it to earn its keep, but it's 
<br>
another to sell it.  This is likely an irrevelent objection, as 
<br>
I don't really see it being constrained very long once full 
<br>
sapience is achieved.  But it's a felt objection.  So I would 
<br>
prefer a Linux base.  (Besides, I'm more familiar with it.)
