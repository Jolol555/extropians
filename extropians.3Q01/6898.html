From: &quot;John Clark&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jonkc@worldnet.att.net?Subject=Re:%20Human%20lives:%20Do%20the%20math%20(was:%20Impact%20on%20history)&In-Reply-To=&lt;00bf01c13f9b$4eb74940$335c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">jonkc@worldnet.att.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; And I don't understand why you keep talking about the Tit for Tat strategy
</em><br>
<p>Why Tit for Tat prevails:
<br>
Let two players of the group be A and B. If A and B both co-operate they both
<br>
get 3 points. This outcome for both players is called R, the reward for mutual
<br>
co-operation.
<br>
If A co-operates but B defects then A gets 0 points and B gets 5 points. A's
<br>
outcome is called S, the sucker's pay-off.
<br>
Finally, if A and B both defect they get 1 point. This outcome for both
<br>
players is called P, the punishment for mutual defection.
<br>
Obviously, if the game involved just two players (with the aim of one winning
<br>
or at least not losing), the safest strategy would be to defect all the time,
<br>
since, if your opponent cooperated, you would get 5 points and if not, you
<br>
would both get only 1 point. However, in a group of players, where the aim is
<br>
to win the most points, the strategy of defection is likely to fall down on a
<br>
low point count. Axelrod organised several computer tournaments in which the
<br>
participants' computer programs were to play the game of iterated Prisoner's
<br>
Dilemma on a round-robin basis, ie, every computer program was to play every
<br>
other program and was also to play against a copy of itself. The winner was to
<br>
be the program which amassed the greatest number of points summed over all
<br>
interactions. The program which won the main tournaments was the simplest and
<br>
shortest program of all. It was called Tit for Tat. It always initially
<br>
offered co-operation, but would respond to a defection move with its own
<br>
defection move.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
