<em>&gt; &gt;  That doesn't have to be the point of a population defense system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Stopping a single accidentally launched missile doesn't sound like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; frivolous goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While not frivolous, it doesn't remove the threat.  If someone tries for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear blackmail, (or wants to take vengence on civilians) being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stop 90% of their missiles won't stop them if they have a few.  And while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would reduce the casualties, it wouldn't reduce the value of the threat,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or significantly reduce the quality of the revenge.
</em><br>
<p>Yes it does. Terrorist groups and the rogue nations that support them
<br>
operate on limited resources. All they get from an attack that fails so
<br>
miserably is a local rally of support from fellow extremists who only
<br>
respect the fact that they tried an attack. They surely won't stick
<br>
around for round two, when we decide to strike back.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As you reinforce, the value does depend on what the goals of the defender
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are.  I'll admit that Redell &amp; Nelson's points (on which I base most of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments) were rooted in cold war strategies, which assumed that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opponents were armed, dangerous, and willing to fire if the value of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arsenal was threatened.  In that situation, working toward population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defense undercut the value of the the oponent's arsenal, moving him closer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to firing preemptively.  The current level of relative peace does change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the strategies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That said, there are still many cases in which having a not-perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defensive shield encourages attacks, and many in which it encourages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential attackers to invest in an arms race.  I haven't seen anything in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this discussion to make me think we're much closer than 20 years to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating a near perfect interdiction system given the approaches SDI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considers.  If we (the gov't) save the billions of dollars that SDI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposes to spend on deploying partially effective systems in the short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term, we (the people) will have more money to spend developing technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that may make this whole approach obsolete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Chris, what makes you think even a country like Russia, which went broke
<br>
once before trying to outspend us, could possibly succeed at the same
<br>
game?
