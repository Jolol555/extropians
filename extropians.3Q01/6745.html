<em>&gt; In a word: No.  It is essentially impossible to sustain a ground

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; nearby or the operation is tiny. &quot;Amateurs study tactics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Professionals study logistics.&quot; Take a look at a map. Notice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how far Afghanistan (and specifically Kabul and the Kandahar)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are from anywhere except Pakistan. Note that cargo aircraft
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot take off and land from aircraft carriers. Remember the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gulf war? The US spent six months building up the supply base.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Hello, Russia?  You're still on good terms with your Turkmen state,
<br>
right?  Well, we were wondering if we could use your already-
<br>
established bases on its southern border as our supply depot.  Oh, and
<br>
all those troops you have just sitting around, waiting for something to
<br>
do to prove Russian military might?  Well, we were wondering if they'd
<br>
mind being our main infantry.  We'll bring the air force, and armor to
<br>
suppliment what you have.  We'll also ask Iran if they want in, but
<br>
you're closer to Afghanistan's capital and a *lot* more reliable than
<br>
Pakistan - though we will offer Pakistan help sealing their borders,
<br>
since they do seem to want out of this fight as much as possible.  Or
<br>
maybe we'll ask India to help there: they could use an excuse to
<br>
improve diplomatic relations with Pakistan, and working shoulder-to-
<br>
shoulder to keep war from spilling over would certainly help.
<br>
<p>&quot;Oh, and if things turn to the worst...you *do* still have a few nukes
<br>
you can point at them, close enough that they'd hit before their
<br>
targets could be informed of the launch, right?  Yes, yes, we'll be
<br>
bringing what anti-missile defenses we have in case they have some
<br>
nukes too.&quot;
