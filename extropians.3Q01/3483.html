<p>
In the news yesterday, it was announced that the State of New Hampshire
<br>
has the lowest poverty rate in the entire US, of only 4.4%, versus the
<br>
national average of 9.6%, of families. The US average is at its lowest
<br>
level in 22 years, yet NH's rate is less than half that of the national
<br>
average. State by state breakdowns show that states with significant
<br>
degrees of socialism in the form of welfare, public health care, high
<br>
taxation, and heavy regulation of business have the highest poverty
<br>
rates among families.
<br>
<p>Also noted was older data of community level measurments of child
<br>
poverty, which ranges from 3 - 13% from town to town, with the higher
<br>
rates of child poverty occuring, interestingly enough, in those same
<br>
communities that are called 'property poor' towns, which have low
<br>
property valuations due to decades of poor local government at the hands
<br>
of Democrat politicians, and consequently are not able to sufficiently
<br>
fund their local school systems without significant state subsidies.
<br>
<p>I think this all pretty much confirms the arguments of libertarians and
<br>
other free market proponents: socialism creates poverty.
