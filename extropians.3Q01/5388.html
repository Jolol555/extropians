<em>&gt;Executive summary: population growth is slowing, people are living

<br>
<p>This article, the assumption made by its author, and your response to
<br>
it, exemplify very well common misconceptions about economics made by
<br>
the media. 
<br>
&nbsp;I don't have much time to make my arguments ( I have to go to work!),
<br>
but I'll simply point out that the assumptions made by the author make
<br>
perfect sense if the country of Japan were a business entity owned by
<br>
the author.  However, the company of Japan is a business owned by its
<br>
citizens. The same concept applies to all western democracies, and all
<br>
of us. 
<br>
This is a *crucial* difference!
