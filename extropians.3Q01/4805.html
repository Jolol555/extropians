<p>This is an interesting graph at the top.  I think I could agree with it
<br>
mostly, but I do have a couple of concerns about this graph.
<br>
<p>First, it only shows negative things, such as unemployment, divorce, etc.  I
<br>
guess the graphs prove that bad things happen to dumb people.  It doesn't
<br>
show that intelligent people actually produce good things.  I wish they had
<br>
shown the graph for positive measures such as grades, salary, etc.
<br>
<p>Second, the negative items are all binary events.  Unemployed or not?  I
<br>
wish they had shown graphs of unemployment time, salary rate, grades or some
<br>
other curves.  These would be easier to compare to the bell curve.  A single
<br>
binary point, such as &quot;poverty: yes/no&quot; are not as useful for analysis as a
<br>
complete curve would be.  Restricting the data to a single cut-off point,
<br>
and then graphing all those cut-off points on a curve is a very common way
<br>
to blur, distort or misinterpret data.  If the original curve of
<br>
unemployment rates, salary, number of divorces, etc. were graphed, we could
<br>
directly see whether the curves follow the same IQ curve.  The graph as
<br>
presented is very imprecise and may or may not support the conclusion as
<br>
given.  I wish they had shown all the data on a curve instead of just a
<br>
single cut-off point such as &quot;poverty: yes/no&quot;.
<br>
<p>I realize that this is more of a populist piece, but I wish the statistical
<br>
analysis and science were more precise in the article and more completely
<br>
disclosed.  I can't say it is wrong, but I can't say that it proves anything
<br>
either.
