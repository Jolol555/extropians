<p><em>&gt; I'd like to know more about this from your POV (point of view), Olga. &gt;
</em><br>
What do you mean? For instance, what's &quot;the best light&quot;, as far as you can
<br>
tell? &gt; I have my guesses, but rather than put words in your mouth, I'll
<br>
ask.
<br>
<p>I quoted myself from a couple of months ago in that &quot;Even in the best light&quot;
<br>
sentence.  Since then, I've been trying to learn about libertarianism but
<br>
have yet to read anything that impresses me.  For instance, I'm reading &quot;The
<br>
Origins of Virtue&quot; by Matt Ridley now (I'm only at Chapter 2).  You'd think
<br>
the author would have put his best foot forward in the Prologue, where
<br>
Ridley begins with the story of Prince Kropotkin's discovery that the world
<br>
really is a good place where -- not shit, but -- mutual aid happens.
<br>
Escaping from prison, Kropotkin was inspired by the courage and help he
<br>
received from several of his fellow human beings - and so was inspired to
<br>
develop his anarchistic ideas further.
<br>
<p>Well, I will continue reading the book with an open mind, but I have to
<br>
confess I feel as if the boat has sprung a leak at the outset of the voyage.
<br>
You see, I know Russians.  There are many things in the world I don't know -
<br>
but I know Russians.  Russians - even Russian Jews - in the 1800s may indeed
<br>
have helped Kropotkin.  But the problem with the story of Kropotkin is that
<br>
Kropotkin was not a Jew.  Had Kropotkin been a Jew, he may not have gotten
<br>
the kind of help he got back then - in Czarist Russia.  That's the missing
<br>
key, and that gives a subjective - not a real-world - perspective to
<br>
Kropotkin's story.  And that's why my boat is listing.
<br>
<p>Someone a week or so ago posted something to me about Ayn Rand, saying that
<br>
she was Russian, too.  Yes, I would have called her a Russian (let's not
<br>
bicker about whether she was really an American once she became an American
<br>
citizen), but most &quot;Russians&quot; (of the Christian variety) from the Russia she
<br>
came out of would have called her a Jew.  Even though Ayn was an atheist -
<br>
she would have been called a Jew.  Even during the &quot;Soviet Union&quot; phase of
<br>
Russia I've heard - I don't know if this is true - that Russian Jews had to
<br>
put down that they were Jews on their passports or something (even in
<br>
atheistic Russia ... interesting if true).  Maybe things have changed now in
<br>
Russia - I don't know.  But I know several Russian Jewish emigres now (who
<br>
came to the U.S. a few years ago), and they've told me stories that confirm
<br>
to me that most &quot;Russians&quot; are still up to their old tricks.
<br>
<p>I'll let you know how the book turns out, and maybe we'll talk further.
<br>
Throwback to me, of course, means &quot;been there, done that, didn't work out
<br>
too well the first time ...&quot;  I wish I knew of one glorious libertarian
<br>
&quot;victory&quot; that changed the U.S. society for the better, the way I've seen
<br>
some democratic victories change all our lives.
