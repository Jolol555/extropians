<em>&gt; &gt; So, in memory of today's sad events I would like to challenge the

<em>&gt; &gt; what ways might be used to create innovative solutions to

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know that there's anything particularly innovative about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these two ideas (and one involves guns, sort of), but anyway:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * Arm and train all flight crew in antiterrorism measures.  If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   entire crew has handguns, you'll need a large number of terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   to hijack a flight.  The political hurdles facing this policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   should be relatively low, as we're not talking about arming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   private individuals, rather airline employees, who would only be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   armed while on duty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * Make the cockpit, and perhaps the entire plane transparent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   the outside world in realtime:  audio and perhaps other feeds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   would be continuously be sent to the ground.  Any abnormality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   detected would immediately alert human monitors, who could take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   appropriate action, from negotiation to shooting the plane down.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   In the worst case, where the terrorists still succeded in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   fashion, we'd at least have a wealth of information about what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   happended and who did it, much more than we have now from a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   chance cell calls.  I'm not generally a fan of surveilance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   but I think privacy issues are of less concern on a plane since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   you're already identified and subject to search, and if applied
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   only to the cockpit, only the privacy of airline employees would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   be compromised, not that of private individuals/passengers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note:  although I fly somewhat regularly, I'm completely ignorant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of airline operations, so I suspect the above ideas are unworkable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for reasons I'm unaware of.
</em><br>
<p>We used to have armed Air Marshals here in the US, but the airlines
<br>
lobbied to get them disbanded because they didn't like not having a
<br>
paying customer in one seat on the plane.
<br>
<p>I think arming aircrews is a good idea, and we need to armor the
<br>
cockpits against armed intrusions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've also barley followed the transparency and gun debates here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the above made a &quot;solution&quot; to both pop into my head:  Everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a choice between being armed and privacy.  Anyone may be armed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (broadly speaking -- include guns, weapons of mass destruction)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but while armed, they must be completely transparent/monitorable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in realtime.  I don't advocate this policy and see many obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems, but it could make an interesting story.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, Mike, this is a rather illogical insistence to make. Making
<br>
those armed transparent only alerts potential hijackers as to who needs
<br>
to get whacked first. Concealed weapons policies are far more effective
<br>
deterrents than open carry policies.
<br>
<p>Transparency is a dumb idea, once again. El Al (the Israeli airline) has
<br>
had air marshals for decades, and they are typically the people you
<br>
would least expect: elderly men, teenage college students, pregnant
<br>
mothers, etc. Nobody on board has any idea who may be armed, and thus El
<br>
Al has not had a hijacking in decades.
<br>
<p>This whole disaster has once again proven the entire stupidity of the
<br>
idea of the 'gun free zone'. We've recently talked about opponents of
<br>
cryonics and other extropian technologies as having the 'blood of
<br>
billions' on their hands. Similarly, anti-gun fascists also bear
<br>
responsibility for this disaster. Note that not one hijacker that we
<br>
know of was armed with guns. They all had pocket knives and box cutter
<br>
utility razors. One armed citizen on each plane could have prevented
<br>
this entire fiasco. Thank Ghu that the three on the Newark flight had
<br>
the intestinal fortitude to charge the hijackers and crash the plane
<br>
before it hit a populated target. I salute the courage of those men, and
<br>
those who may have been wrestling for control of the flight that hit the
<br>
Pentagon, which they suspect was actually aimed toward the White House.
<br>
<p>I just wonder if the statisticians will be honest enough to classify the
<br>
tens of thousands of victims of this as victims of illegal use of
<br>
knives.
