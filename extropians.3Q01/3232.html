<em>&gt; &gt; Sorry, but I respectfully and completely disagree. Our current concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the singularity is grounded in science, not philosophy. It is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simple forward extrapolation of well-understood phenomena.
</em><br>
<p>The development of technology on the largest scale, the autocatalytic
<br>
aspects of intelligence amplification (which we only partially have today)
<br>
and how all this interacts with human culture, adaptability and economics
<br>
are hardly simple or well-understood.

<em>&gt; Let's work on the concept of transhumanism first, and then worry about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connection (if any) with a singularity. The understanding I offered above of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism has a teleological and an ethical component. Perhaps we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree on this. Your post emphasizes the predictive nature of science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps your understanding of transhumanism is similar to Robin Hansons:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Transhumanism is the idea that new technologies are likely to change the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world so much in the next century or two that our descendants will in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways no longer be &quot;human.&quot; &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (This quote is from Ander's site). This definition seems more in line with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your comments than the one I offered. For myself, I not sure how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enlightening it is to concentrate simply on the likelihood of various future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; histories. Suppose some Joyians (followers of Bill Joy) think that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very likely that our descendants may no longer be human, but see this as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrible catastrophe. Even though they understand that there is an extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low probability of stopping these changes, nevertheless they valiantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; struggle to stop the march of technology. On the other hand, suppose that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are some that think that we ought to use technology to perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves even though they think there is a low probabilty that we will do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so. (Perhaps because they think that the disparate elements of society that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are afraid of such changes will galvanize in opposition making progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible). Nevertheless, these heroic souls bravely struggle for &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause&quot;. It seems to me that the latter are the transhumanists, not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; former, even though they make rather bleak predictions. In other words, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the ethical imperative that seems to me to be more central to the concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of transhumanism, as opposed to any predictions (short of certainty) about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the likelihood of various future histories. Mark
</em><br>
<p>This seems related to the discussions we had during the writing of the
<br>
transhumanist FAQ. The same issues came up there. Maybe we could
<br>
distinguish between radical futurism - the idea that the future will not be
<br>
like the present in some relevant ways - and transhumanism - the idea that
<br>
it is good in some sense to strive for some of these futures. 
<br>
<p>Traditionally it has of course been the transhumanists who have been doing
<br>
most of the thinking and imagining of radical futures. Recently radical
<br>
futurism is becoming more common, and this actually poses an interesting
<br>
challenge for us transhumanists: how do we justify our striving to others?
<br>
Previously the radical futurism was hard enough to sell, and most of the
<br>
efforts went into convincing people that nanotech or cryonics was even
<br>
possible. These days it is more a question about showing that many popular
<br>
radical futures are *not* possible (no clone armies!) and arguing against
<br>
future shock/reaction.
