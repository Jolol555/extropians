I received the September issue of Scientific American today.  This is
<br>
the special issue on nanotech, with some of the articles available
<br>
online at <a href="http://www.sciam.com/2001/0901issue/0901quicksummary.html">http://www.sciam.com/2001/0901issue/0901quicksummary.html</a>.
<br>
<p>Here are some excerpts from the article by Richard Smalley.  Smalley is
<br>
a Nobel prize winning chemist (discoverer of buckminsterfullerene) and
<br>
nanotech researcher.  The article does not really have anything new for
<br>
those who are familiar with Smalley's criticisms of nanotech.

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Chemistry, Love and Nanobots
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Richard E. Smalley
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How soon will we see the nanometer-scale robots envisaged by K. Eric
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drexler and other molecular nanotechnologists?  The simple answer
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is never.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, it has become popular to imagine tiny robots
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(sometimes called assemblers) that can manipulate and build things
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;atom by atom.  Imagine a single assembler: working furiously, this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hypothetical nanorobot would make many new bonds as it went about
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its assigned task, placing perhaps up to a billion new atoms in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desired structure every second.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how realistic is this notion of a self-replicating nanobot?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's think about it.  Atoms are tiny and move in a defined and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circumscribed way - a chemist would say that they move so as to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minimize the free energy of their local surroundings.  The electronic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;glue&quot; that sticks them to one another is not local to each bond but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rather is sensitive to the exact position and identity of all the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;atoms in the near vicinity.  So when the nanomanipulator arm of our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nanobot picks up an atom and goes to insert it in the desired place,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it has a fundamental problem.  It also has to somehow control not only
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this new atom but all the existing atoms in the region.  No problem,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you say: our nanobot will have an additional manipulator arm for each
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of these atoms.  Then it would have complete control of all the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goings-on that occur at the reaction site.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But remember, this region where the chemistry is to be controlled
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the nanobot is very, very small - about one nanometer on a side.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That constraint leads to at least two basic difficulties.  I call
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one the fat fingers problem and the other the sticky fingers problem.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the fingers of a manipulator arm must themselves be made out
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of atoms, they have a certain irreducible size.  There just isn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough room in the nanometer-size reactive region to accomodate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the fingers of all the manipulators necessary to have complete
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;control of the chemistry.  In a famous 1959 talk that has inspired
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nanotechnologists everywhere, Nobel physicist Richard Feynman memorably
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;noted, &quot;There's plenty of room at the bottom.&quot;  But there's not *that*
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much room.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manipulator fingers on the hypothetical self-replicating nanobot
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are not only too fat; they are also too sticky: the atoms of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manipulator hands will adhere to the atom that is being moved.  So it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will often be impossible to release this miniscule building block in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;precisely the right spot.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both these problems are fundamental, and neither can be avoided.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-replicating, mechanical nanobots are simply not possible in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our world.  To put every atom in its place - the vision articulated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by some nanotechnologists - would require magic fingers.  Such a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nanobot will never become more than a futurist's daydream.
