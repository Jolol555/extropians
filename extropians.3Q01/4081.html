</em><br>
<em>&gt;                  Democrats back off on firearms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An interesting article on the front page of todays &quot;USA Today&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (www.usatoday.com).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to the article the NRA is now considered the nations most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerfull lobby, surpassing the AARP.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The rest of the article is your basic extremocrat tabloid anti-gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bias.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropian Angle? Grassroots organizations can be effective.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, they can, but they also need to have their arguments very well
<br>
grounded, beyond large membership and massive funding. The grassroots
<br>
groups on the anti-gun side have failed miserably despite greater
<br>
funding and greater media support simply because their ideology is bad.
<br>
Both the HCI, which has renamed itself to remove the 'handgun control'
<br>
label from itself. It's now camouflaged as the 'Brady Campaign'. Its
<br>
primary funder, Monster.com founder Andrew McKelvey, who was on its
<br>
board of directors, has gone off and started his own group, Americans
<br>
for Gun Safety, with an initial $16 million in funding... 
<br>
<p>Both have acknowledged in internal memos and surveys that their focus on
<br>
registration, gun bans, and restrictions against law abiding citizens
<br>
owning guns has badly backfired on them, and acknowledge that the vast
<br>
majority of the populace believes that there is an individual right to
<br>
keep and bear arms that these groups want to confiscate. Additionally,
<br>
the Democratic Party is removing gun control planks from its party
<br>
platform, and is trying to shake the reputation it has acquired that the
<br>
party is &quot;against religious people, gun owners, veterans and the
<br>
military, business people, and white people in general, especially white
<br>
males&quot;.
<br>
<p>All three groups are now refocusing on 'responsible use' policies, like
<br>
firearms safety training. At the same time they are pushing states to
<br>
eliminate century old NRA crafted safety courses as acceptable for
<br>
concealed carry license requirements, they are crafting their own safety
<br>
courses, that are essentially rip-offs of the NRA courses, and getting
<br>
states to require that their courses be taught for license requirements
<br>
(and charging far higher fees than the NRA ever did). This is part of a
<br>
'reclaiming the middle' strategy: by establishing their groups in the
<br>
eyes of the public as 'the authority' on gun safety, they can redefine
<br>
the middle ground and the terms of debate to a greater extent than they
<br>
have be able to in the past. Only then, they say, can they expect to
<br>
make headway with gun registration and licensing on a nationwide basis.
<br>
<p>Notice this strategy of claiming and redefining the middle. We
<br>
extropians should pay heed to this, because at this moment, we are
<br>
significantly behind in the media and public perceptions, despite a
<br>
majority being in support of things like stem cell research, there is
<br>
not such a majority of support for cloning, which would be necessary to
<br>
make stem cell cures for Parkinsons and other diseases work.
<br>
<p>Similarly, the movie AI seriously creeped out a significant percent of
<br>
the population. Anti-AI memes have been injected into the populace and
<br>
are now laying dormant. Furthermore, other anti-tech memes, like the
<br>
&quot;Moon landing hoax&quot; meme, are continually being promulgated even among
<br>
the major media. 
<br>
<p>I am very glad we have ProAct going, but we need to find some angel
<br>
donors to endow it with a multi-million dollar annual budget so it can
<br>
hire staff to operate as a real lobbying group, not just a hobby for a
<br>
few people. The longer we wait to get this going, the further behind in
<br>
the game we get. If we could get just a few hundred thousand dollars in
<br>
seed money, I could put together a fund raising mailing campaign to
<br>
raise millions from the science and technology community.
