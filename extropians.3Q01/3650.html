</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was 1994 to be exact,
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I have determined that this was at the end of 1993.  Most of the
<br>
articles criticizing this remark were published in 1994.  Since most of the
<br>
reference did not give a specific source person and date, most of the modern
<br>
references seem to quote the date on the articles they are reading not of
<br>
the original quote.  I also note a lot of variation in this quote, another
<br>
indication that people are not getting back to the original sources.
<br>
However, I have found enough sources to demonstrate that this seems to be
<br>
real.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; now can we get back an address the issue? Is Jesse Jackson a racist?
</em><br>
<p>This is almost a trick question.  Jackson's original quote said that he was
<br>
ashamed to have this distinction between blacks and whites in his mind.
<br>
Therefore, he seems to be giving an example of where even he has racial
<br>
prejudice and/or discrimination in his mind.  However, he gives this as an
<br>
example of what we need to stop doing.  So is he a racist?  No.  He seems to
<br>
be admitting that racism is a common and natural feeling that we all need to
<br>
fight to overcome.  He admits some racist thoughts, but is fighting to end
<br>
racism.
<br>
<p>There are different definitions for different words depending on who you
<br>
ask.  I don't know that racism requires genetic root causes.  Most people
<br>
haven't decided if they believe behavior is more caused by genetics or
<br>
culture.  It probably is a mixture of both.  If you insist that racism be
<br>
limited to genetic causes, then I think hardly anything would ever be
<br>
considered racist.
<br>
<p>Is he discriminating based on race?  In this example, yes he is.  Is it a
<br>
fair or accurate discrimination?  No, it is not.  Statistically speaking,
<br>
blacks may commit more crimes than whites.  Does that mean he should assume
<br>
the white guy is not going to assault him?  Does that mean he should assume
<br>
the black guy is going to assault him?  Neither assumption is valid.  Even
<br>
if one is statistically more likely to occur, it is not a scientific basis
<br>
for predicition.  The methodology that observing a person's race will help
<br>
predict their criminal behavior is wrong.
<br>
<p>More to the point, the race of the person is not indicative of future
<br>
behavior.  It is not statistically predictive.  It may be true that blacks
<br>
commit more crimes than whites.  However, most black people are law-abiding
<br>
citizens, as are most white people.  Poverty would be a more scientific
<br>
indicator.  A white street bum would probably be more dangerous than a rich
<br>
black businessman or a black preacher.  When we adjust for these better
<br>
factors, we would find that rich black business men are probably no more
<br>
likely to commit crime than rich white business men.  Likewise, a black
<br>
preacher is probably no more likely to commit a crime than a white preacher.
<br>
Therefore, the race is not a good indicator at all.  The relative wealth of
<br>
the person or religious value is a better indicator.
<br>
<p>Therefore, I don't really care if we call these attitudes racist, prejudice
<br>
or discrimination.  To link unrelated traits to race is racist.  To make
<br>
decisions based on race rather than people's individual merits is racist.  I
<br>
don't see much value in arguing whether something is racist, racially
<br>
prejudiced or racially discriminatory.  Let's just say that it is just plain
<br>
scientifically invalid, and leave it at that.
<br>
<p>Is there any good reason to split hairs with these terms, except to be able
<br>
to practice prejudice and discrimination while claiming not to be racist?
