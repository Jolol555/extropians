<em>&gt; [stuff snipped]
</em><br>
<p>You seem to have missed my original point.  Heston's speech clearly does not
<br>
say the things I list.  It seems to imply these things by references to
<br>
certain words or by listing certain groups or by describing unspecified
<br>
actions to be taken in the future.  I acknowledged in my very first post
<br>
that I couldn't *prove* these things by his words.  I felt that his words
<br>
may evoke additional ideas in the audience that were not specifically
<br>
stated.
<br>
<p>I can concede that this speech might have been intended to be against
<br>
political correctness and not imply any negativity toward blacks, women,
<br>
gays and other minorities.  I also can concede that this was given to a
<br>
group of predominately rich white males and spoke to their point of view,
<br>
and probably wasn't intended to be addressed to other groups.
<br>
<p>But, can you concede that all of his examples of bad situations and good
<br>
situations were not evenly distributed among minority groups?  Maybe that is
<br>
just a side-effect of how political correctness works, but all his &quot;bad&quot;
<br>
examples were about blacks, gays, feminists, transsexuals, transvestites,
<br>
people with AIDS, liberals, etc., while all of his &quot;good&quot; examples were
<br>
about white pride, gun-owners, conservatives, NRA members, etc.  Although he
<br>
may see all ethnic groups as equally good, his examples only showed one
<br>
group as good whereas all the others were shown as bad.  Even if this was
<br>
not intended, can you see where an implication might be derived from this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Laws which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seek to hire gays to achieve some sort of arbitrarily defined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiculturality are also special treatment.
</em><br>
<p>Please.  I will send you $100 if you can show me an actual enacted law that
<br>
mandates quotas for hiring gays.  I think this is just a straw-man argument.
<br>
(Not invented by you.)  I'm sure you heard about this from a friend of a
<br>
friend, but I think this is just another urban legend.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I support equal rights for gay/lesbians on marriage, cohabitation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insurance, joint tax returns, inheriting property, joint ownership
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of property etc, but not special treatment.
</em><br>
<p>I agree totally.  I wish Heston had said this as clearly.  He didn't mention
<br>
giving gays any of these equal rights.  He only mentioned blocking
<br>
unspecified special treatment.  It is not clear from his speech if he
<br>
supports any of these equal rights you list above.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Your right, he did not specifically say that patients had a right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to know, he said that a law which allowed dentists to conceal the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that they were HIV-positive was wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The opposite of conceal is to reveal.
</em><br>
<p>This is the exact parallel that he uses in all his statements.  I am
<br>
surprised that you see it here, but not elsewhere.  He gives an example of
<br>
something that is &quot;bad&quot;.  It is up to the audience to interpret what would
<br>
be good.  As you point out, they will usually interpret the opposite event
<br>
to be &quot;good&quot; because &quot;good&quot; is the opposite of &quot;bad&quot;.
<br>
<p>I fear that people will follow this same pattern when interpreting his other
<br>
examples.  When he says gays shouldn't be given more rights, someone might
<br>
decide that they should be given less rights.  When he says whites need more
<br>
pride, someone might decide that blacks need less pride.  When he says
<br>
liberals shouldn't teach liberal propaganda in school, someone might decide
<br>
that conservatives should teach conservative propaganda instead.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Busted! He was not giving a speech to the NRA, but to the Harvard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law school forum.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  I referenced the wrong group here.  It was not germane to my point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At no point does he argue against free speech for certain songs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teachers, or entertainers.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps, but his clearly brags about getting Ice-T's contract canceled
<br>
because of the bad lyrics.  Someone could easily think that improper speech
<br>
should be stopped.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; When he says you can accept but not celebrate homosexuality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; without being a homophobe, he implies that we can accept that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; it  exists but we don't have to like it or even cooperate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; He didn't say the second part but in this case  I think that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; a pretty good implication based on the facts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Again, he didn't say it, but it sure is implied.  Why did you feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;compelled to agree that it's a pretty good implication based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the facts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because he clearly said it? &quot;We don't have to like it or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooperate with it&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;We&quot; he has included himself.
</em><br>
<p>You are inadvertently proving my point again.  Heston did not clearly say
<br>
this.  The words you are insisting are a quote from Heston are actually my
<br>
words of what I thought he was implying.  If you read the original speech,
<br>
he doesn't say anything about not liking or cooperating with homosexuality.
<br>
I just said that some people might think this was implied.  You apparently
<br>
got confused with this same implication when you strongly asserted that
<br>
Heston clearly said it.  I think the implication would be clear in some
<br>
people's minds.  This is the exact kind of &quot;implied&quot; material that concerns
<br>
me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you saying there is a secret society of racists amongst the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of the Harvard Law School Forum? This is where he gave this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speech.
</em><br>
<p>No.  But there does seem to be an unspecified agenda among these
<br>
predominately rich white males that is causing them to prepare to fight a
<br>
culture war over differences in race (whatever that means).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So you do think there is a secret racist society at Harvard? ( ;)
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't call them secret, because they are well known.  I wouldn't call
<br>
them racist, because people here dispute what the word means.  I do question
<br>
the race-friendliness of a group of rich white males with white pride who
<br>
refuse to call African-Americans anything but &quot;negros&quot; and are preparing for
<br>
a cultural war over racial differences.  But you can use any term for this
<br>
that you see fit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But Harvey he WAS! He was arguing for the right of free speech, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against political correctness.
</em><br>
<p>I will even concede that he was arguing against political correctness.  But
<br>
I don't think he was arguing for blacks, gays and the like.  All his
<br>
references to these other groups were in terms of how they are unfair or
<br>
doing something wrong.  All his examples of white males were of how they
<br>
should have more pride, stand up for their rights, and get more freedom.
<br>
Even if they were all accurate examples, there was a pattern where only
<br>
white males were good and all other groups were dishonest, unfair or out of
<br>
control.  At best, this was a defense of white males against attacks from
<br>
these other groups.  I do not see it as a fight for the equal rights of
<br>
these other groups.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I understand that you don't see this as inclusive, it probably was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not intended that way,  he was arguing that political correctness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is wrong, that advocates of free speech need to take a tough stand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and his speech was a shot across the bow of those we fight.
</em><br>
<p>This I agree with totally.  There is racial discrimination in all
<br>
directions.  There is sexual prejudice and unfairness to all genders and
<br>
orientations.  I even agree with everything you claim the speech said.  I
<br>
was worried over possible implications that were not quite said, but
<br>
possibly alluded to.  If these implications were there, I think you would
<br>
condemn them as I have.
<br>
<p>So on basics, I think we agree.  On this specific, we do not agree on how
<br>
conservative or how liberal or exactly where Heston stands, or more
<br>
specifically exactly what this speech was intended to accomplish.  I still
<br>
fear the rhetoric calling for a cultural war over race, gender or sexual
<br>
orientation, but on equal rights for all I think we agree.
<br>
<p>Perhaps we can agree that the terminology relating to race, gender and
<br>
sexual orientation have been so politicized and distorted that we may not be
<br>
reading the same meaning when we reach the same words.  I'm not sure what
<br>
more can be gained by discussing Heston's individual speech.  I am more
<br>
heartened by the fact that we seem to agree on equal rights for all, and no
<br>
special rights for some.
