<p><em>&gt;&gt;I would say you are incorrect.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;#### The word &quot;incorrect&quot; is out of place here. What I voiced was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a moral statement, an expression of what I perceive as right,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proper, ethically imperative, as opposed to merely &quot;correct&quot;. Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opinion, obviously different, is not more &quot;correct&quot;, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indicative of a totally divergent attitude towards fellow humans.
</em><br>
<p>The statement &quot;I would say you are incorrect&quot; is clearly an
<br>
opinion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;We agree.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;### Are you using pluralis maiestatis?
</em><br>
<p>Merely agreeing on a point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;#### Some persons, through no fault of their own, cannot afford
</em><br>
<em>&gt;medical treatment (what if you have a stroke at age 16?). Kids or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no kids, they can't pay. Are you saying that they are useless,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discardable, by definition not worthy of being helped? Would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;let them starve amid plenty?
</em><br>
<p>There are provisions for such people, but I do not support
<br>
enlarging those provisions and creating a class of people who stop
<br>
striving to better themselves.
<br>
<p>I encourage and even insist on personnal responsibility.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Don't need to know.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;#### You don't want to know about the suffering of others, lest it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disturb your afternoon nap?
</em><br>
<p>I don't need to know about their personnal financial status since
<br>
in my eyes they are responsible for themselves.
<br>
<p>Sadly I'm always too busy at work during the week to enjoy an
<br>
afternoon nap. Probably because I'm paying for someone else's bad
<br>
decisions. 
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;I think that a workable and fair system would offer tiered,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;government-standardized but privately run insurance plans to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;citizens. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;You're not talking government standardized, you're talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;government subsidized.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;#### No, it's subsidized AND standardized
</em><br>
<p>I don't have a problem with standardized, but I do with the
<br>
subsidized part.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I vote no.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;#### Why should your idea of fairness be respected if you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;care about, literally, the life and death of innocent people? It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a heartfelt conviction of the vast majority of humans, that an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;innocent person (= who didn't get in trouble through his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stupidity, laziness, etc.) has to be helped when in need. Are we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all &quot;unfair&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Oldest debate tactic in the book, accuse the other side of
<br>
something and force them to defend.
<br>
<p>I do care about people and as I stated here in the U.S there are
<br>
provisions, but I do not support an enlarging of these provisions
<br>
when every piece of evidence we have says it will be to the long
<br>
term detriment of all involved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;With my help, administered with a gun to my head, no thanks.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;### Well, at least no innocent persons would die, except if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moved about too much and the jackbooted government thug, holding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the gun while taking the money, would decide to bump you off as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;precaution.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;(I am being sarcastic here)
</em><br>
<p>Obviously we part company on this note.
