<em>&gt; Mike, you are ignoring the fact that genetics is not part of the definition

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that groups, distinguishes, prejudices or discriminates based on race.  Any
</em><br>

</em><br>
snip many definition links...
<br>
<p>Frankly, I don't care what *current* dictionaries say a word means.
<br>
IMHO, one reason today's society is so screwed up is that everyone has
<br>
their own damn definition of things, so that people get pissed off at
<br>
other peoples statements over meanings that were not intended, among
<br>
other things.
<br>
<p>Today's dictionaries are as screwed up as today's society. Part of this
<br>
is from the propaganda and disinformation of demagogues, as I've
<br>
illustrated in past essays (if you haven't read them yet, Harvey, I
<br>
really suggest you read them).
<br>
<p>Some people may think a word means something, when by rational semantic
<br>
analysis one can determine that objectively, it does not. Dictionaries
<br>
only record what many people think are different meanings of words.
<br>
Dictionary people today generally do not make strict calls as to whether
<br>
words actually do mean what some people think they mean.
<br>
<p>For example, one can easily expose how non-genetic based statements
<br>
about cultural groups cannot be said to be racist when they are
<br>
describing cultural characteristics. 
<br>
<p>Races are not cultures, though in some geographical areas of the world,
<br>
most members of one race tend to share common cultural characteristics.
<br>
Thus making statements about those cultures are improperly misconstrued
<br>
to apply to the race in general when they are simply being applied to
<br>
the members of that culture to which most members are of one race.
<br>
<p>In the US, it is a fact that blacks do generally have an overall culture
<br>
which is different from that of whites. There are of course sub-cultures
<br>
within that culture, but it is not racist to describe characteristics of
<br>
that culture, and there are some whites which ascribe to that culture,
<br>
or subcultures of it (i.e. white rappers, rastafarians, etc). You would
<br>
have to invent a new term, like 'culturist', to describe such
<br>
characteristics. Delineating between culturism and racism is of
<br>
paramount importance, and being strict about not conflating the two is
<br>
doubly so.
