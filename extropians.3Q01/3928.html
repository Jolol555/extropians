Subject: Re: Mensa, was Re: IQ tests
<br>
<p>Yes, and apparently their primary real distinction in the world was an
<br>
ability to devise IQ tests to test very high intelligence..... talk
<br>
about self selection...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Mike,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Promethus and Mega do attempt to devise tests to quantify genius.
<br>
This is very much a good thing. But implying self-selection is a prime
<br>
motivating factor...well maybe you should read Gift of Fire...Prom/Mega
<br>
are trying to &quot;Reach&quot; as many people as they can.
<br>
Promethus and Mega have a big problem..there is very little interest
<br>
in the psychometric community in differentiating between the ultra-
<br>
high fractions of the top percentile on standard IQ tests. They are 
<br>
trying to do an end run around this... but there is still difficulties.
<br>
Once you've hit the apex of standard crystal g (or something
<br>
very very close to it) where do you work to grow next? This
<br>
is the sort of question the ultra-high IQ folks seem to be looking at.
<br>
AMong other things.  Promethus and Mega are solidly on
<br>
the right team ideologically. Transhumanist technology implies
<br>
trying to get smarter (I would say &quot;quantifiably smarter&quot;). But
<br>
to quantify we have to have testing with predictive power.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A question for the list.. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving aside the question of AI, what's the list impression
<br>
of what a superhuman mind might be like (yes I know this
<br>
is asking the gorillas about a super-silverback :).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I tend to think that superhuman intelligence might be best
<br>
classified as levels of intelligence quantifiably different from our own.
<br>
An individual with a 4 sigma IQ and a PerfectRecall chip in their 
<br>
cortex is smarter. But their baseline intel is the same just more
<br>
effeciently harnessed. What is everyone's favorites for a cohesive
<br>
theory of general intelligence? I dislike Multiple Intelligences/Gardner
<br>
because it lacks any evidence.   Triarchic Intelligence/Sternburg is
<br>
proposed in a much more scientific fashion (and it's author is actually
<br>
attempting to prove/disprove his hypothesis, unlike Gardner).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, I can see giving everyone in the human race a 140 IQ,
<br>
perfect recall, and a turbocharged cognition system. But what ELSE
<br>
can we try to do?  
<br>
<p>regards,
<br>
Brian
