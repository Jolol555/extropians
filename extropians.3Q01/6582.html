<p>Excellent. We're talking about ground troops, then. Because the sigint is
<br>
yet incapable of tracking small bands of people from high above, and tell
<br>
it apart from innocents, and you can't send in robotic fighters to
<br>
slaughter them. So, uniformed people have to do it.
<br>
<p>So, we're talking about more body bags. How many more body bags do you
<br>
think the U.S. will tolerate, especially after what has happened? I don't
<br>
have to ask to know that Germany as a member of NATO will get very cold
<br>
feet when we're talking about 10 dead young men. The European NATO as a
<br>
whole is similiarly constrained. If you can get Russians to cooperate you
<br>
will push the envelope further, but you might not like their methods.
<br>
<p>For obvious reasons purely technological warfare against a small group of
<br>
extremists hiding in what is one of the poorest, most abused nations in
<br>
the world (starting with the British involvement, as Charlie so helpfully
<br>
pointed out) is atrocious.
<br>
<p>You will get your war. There's no need asking for it extra, the people on
<br>
the street are clamoring for it loud enough. At this point every sane and
<br>
rational person should not only stop amplifying hate but try to spread
<br>
information and moderation amongst those who are willing to listen.
<br>
<p>Retaliation always overshoots, and this time it looks it will overshoot
<br>
very badly. Try to limit the damage.
