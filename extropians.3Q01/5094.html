</em><br>
<p>Okay, interesting. My initial reply to Waldemar was a bit flip, but had a
<br>
serious point: that a lot of modern philosophical ideas have classical
<br>
pedigrees, which may be useful information for some debates.
<br>
<p>There are different forms of Aristotelianism. I am concerned that
<br>
Aristotelian moral reasoning is not usually applied in our society merely by
<br>
analogy. Rather, it is applied quite directly in ways that suggest that the
<br>
ends of being &quot;human&quot; are unchanging and any efforts that will change our
<br>
nature are morally wrong. E.g. look at the Catholic Church's attitude to
<br>
such a seemingly small transhumanist step as employing contraception. This
<br>
attitude is supposedly backed up by Aristotelian ethical reasoning.
<br>
<p>Aristotle's view is surprisingly difficult to describe in detail, but I'll
<br>
try. Once you get a handle on it, it is also surprisingly commonsensical.
<br>
Aristotle is more concerned to give some structure to our moral thinking
<br>
than to develop bold new principles to reconstruct it, as the utilitarians
<br>
attempted, for example.
<br>
<p>He begins by suggesting that &quot;goods&quot; correspond to the ends or goals of
<br>
inquiries, activities and so on, e.g. the end of the &quot;good&quot; of &quot;medical art&quot;
<br>
is health. Some ends conduce to wider ends, e.g. trades aiming at making
<br>
equipment for horses conduce to riding, and so on. Master ends are to be
<br>
preferred to subordinate ends. To avoid an infinite regress, something must
<br>
be the highest end. Aristotle said that it is generally agreed that highest
<br>
end is happiness (eudaemonia), but the question then is: what is happiness?
<br>
<p>Aristotle said that, if a *function* could be found for human beings as
<br>
such, this might clarify the nature of human happiness. He said that the
<br>
uniquely human function is &quot;leading an active life of the element that has a
<br>
rational principle&quot;. He held that this entailed leading a life of &quot;virtuous
<br>
activity of the soul&quot;.
<br>
<p>Since the life of activity in accordance with virtue is happiness, Aristotle
<br>
then needed an account of virtue.  Since virtue is a feature of the soul, he
<br>
also needed an account of the soul.
<br>
<p>Aristotle says that the soul has irrational and rational elements. The
<br>
irrational includes the purely &quot;vegetative&quot; element that causes nutrition
<br>
and growth (which is not distinctively human), but also the element of
<br>
desire.  This can share in the rational principle insofar as desire is ruled
<br>
by reason. He said that some virtues are moral while some are intellectual,
<br>
and this reflects the distinctively human elements of the soul and their
<br>
excellences.
<br>
<p>Aristotle then explains what the virtues are. They are not passions such as
<br>
anger, fear, joy  etc.; nor are they faculties such as the capacity to feel
<br>
anger. Virtues are states of character, i.e. the things by which we stand
<br>
well or badly with reference to passions, such as standing badly with
<br>
respect to anger if we feel it too violently or too weakly.  The virtue of a
<br>
man is the state of character (essentially dispostions). At this point
<br>
Aristotle uses the Golden Mean idea: virtue consists in having neither
<br>
excess nor defect of the relevant passion but a correct amount which is the
<br>
mean relative to us and determined by a rational principle, namely by that
<br>
principle which would be adopted by a man of practical wisdom. This doesn't
<br>
mean moderation in everything but an *appropriate measure* in respect to
<br>
such things as feelings of fear and confidence, regard to pleasures and
<br>
pains, regard to money, regard to honour and dishonour, to anger, to truth,
<br>
to being pleasant etc.
<br>
<p>Aristotle goes through these in detail:
<br>
<p>*courage is a mean against excessive fearlessness or rashness, or cowardice;
<br>
<p>*temperance is the mean against self-indulgence or &quot;insensibility&quot;;
<br>
<p>*liberality is the mean against prodigality or meanness;
<br>
<p>*then there's &quot;magnificence&quot; with large sums of money, against
<br>
tastelessness/vulgarity or niggardliness (the meaning of which you all
<br>
know);
<br>
<p>*&quot;proper pride&quot; is the mean against empty vanity or undue humility;
<br>
<p>*there is a mean with no name against being ambitious or unambitious;
<br>
<p>*good temper is a mean against irascibility and &quot;inirascibility&quot;;
<br>
<p>*truthfulness is a mean against boastfulness or false modesty;
<br>
<p>*being &quot;ready-witted&quot; is a mean against buffoonery or boorishness;
<br>
<p>*friendliness is a mean against obsequiousness or flattery, or being
<br>
quarrelsome or surly (or divisive, perhaps, Lee).
<br>
<p>The difficulty with all this is that, although it is pretty commonsensical,
<br>
and seems more attractive to me than grand normative theories such as
<br>
utilitarianism or philosophical egalitarianism, it is also potentially very
<br>
conservative. It tends to leave things as they were - we already *know* what
<br>
the virtues are, but merely needed some analysis of the structure of our
<br>
knowledge. Aristotelianism corresponds, more than other formal ethical
<br>
systems, with commonsense ethics. As Anders suggests, however, this gives it
<br>
little chance of taking into account dispositions that might seem different
<br>
in other cultures or changed circumstances. Of course, we can apply
<br>
Aristotelian thinking to our own circumstances, but it is hard to see how we
<br>
can get out of it values different from those we put in. It just doesn't
<br>
work that way, tending to structure our ideas of what is good rather than
<br>
encouraging us to re-examine them.
<br>
<p>Transhumanism, by contrast, does not invoke common sense, or practical
<br>
reason, in the normal way (though its means of inquiry may well be
<br>
*continuous* with common sense methods of inquiry, as I explained of
<br>
scientific inquiry in an earlier post). To apply the Aristotelian concepts
<br>
of human functioning, eudaemonia, virtue (as disposition) and so on in a
<br>
transhumanist context may be quite a challenge. I cannot immediately see how
<br>
to do it, though there are aspects that seem more attractive than the rival
<br>
theories, particularly the emphasis on rationality and happiness.
<br>
<p>I suppose we might need to begin a few steps back with the function of
<br>
leading an active life in accordance with reason, and what this might now
<br>
involve. Certainly, the particular virtues (and vices) that Aristotle
<br>
identified don't take us very far, and I don't think they were meant to,
<br>
since Aristotle was not a thinker who was oriented to moral reform.
<br>
<p>Back to you. See if there's anything you can do with this analysis of the
<br>
theory and its possible problems.
