<em>&gt;&gt; I really hope this doesnt get out of hand, but Im gonna try to call
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this like I see it. Am I the only one picking up the message that men tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to be more drawn to the dynamic environment of Capitalism, where women tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to identify more with socialistic view? I think this may stem from some
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to potential gains from risk.
</em><br>
<p>I think it's important to paint the entire picture, so please allow me to
<br>
stretch the canvas.  Women have been a notch up from a slave to men in many
<br>
economic political environments.  In that as early as 100 years ago, women
<br>
were the property of their fathers or their husbands (&quot;Man and wife&quot;), they
<br>
had been trained to live off the male owner like any other animal.
<br>
Property moved from father to son, or husband to son.  This could help
<br>
clarify, at least to some degree, why a some women may have felt more
<br>
comfortable with socialism.  Today, is another picture.  Women preferring
<br>
socialism may have a nostalgia for the past, carry a bit of animosity for
<br>
the many years in slavery, or still harbor the broad consensus that the
<br>
government owes its people - male and female - something in return for the
<br>
heavy taxation.  Some have no moral issue with government grants and other
<br>
hand-outs which are not given without hard work and merit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And why not? The baby isn't gonna generate any profit this quarter. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guy who wants a family can be all the capitalist he wants, but he needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to give up some of his own earnings for the wife and kids.
</em><br>
<p>It makes sense to me that in a partnership where both parties want a
<br>
family, that both parties work and pay equally.  Producing and raising a
<br>
child is said to be one of the toughest jobs there is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Having to give up your own earnings to fund someone else's laziness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certainly unfair, and I'm sure the socialist system recipient
</em><br>
<em>&gt;acknowledges this as he/she cashes their government check.
</em><br>
<p>I agree totally.  If one partner (male or female) is out playing golf all
<br>
day while the other manages a high-end corporation, this is very unfair.
<br>
Unless this is the agreement of the partnership.
