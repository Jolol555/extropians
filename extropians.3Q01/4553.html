<em>&gt;&gt; I've got an even better idea!  We all know that education is the key.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; We should forthwith open up in every city in America a number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; places where people can come in and read almost any book for FREE.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Not only that, but after proper licensing, they might take any of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the materials home, and study to their hearts' content.  While perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it wouldn't be appropriate to fund this at the national level, I very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; much favor local municipalities getting behind this idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why is this a better idea than being able to read and study
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything you want, whenever you want, from the convenience of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own home?  All it would take is some sufficient room in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IP wars and a just a bit more cheap and ubiquitous hardware.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are almost there now.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, yes!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Education is all that the under class needs!  If each person were to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; take full advantage of what would be available under my proposal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; poverty and ignorance would be greatly reduced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree that education is all that is needed, unfortunately. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not sure about the malleability of adult brains and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general equality of brains as far as general intelligence goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't seem to exist.  SO how can education be all that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I was being sarcastic.  (This miscommunication is what
<br>
invariably happens to me when I'm not being literal-minded,
<br>
of which, it was complained, I am too wont to do.)
<br>
<p>In reality, of course, all these proposals---including yours
<br>
too, unfortunately---cannot, in the old phrase, &quot;turn a sow's
<br>
ear into a silk purse&quot;.  Two things will always be missing---
<br>
pace Singularity---namely:  (1) the native talent, intelligence,
<br>
and temperament that distinguish thoughtful, productive, and
<br>
intelligent people the world over from the criminal, the
<br>
stupid, and the insane, and, (2) the traditions, cultural mores,
<br>
and memes that prosperous and technologically advanced segments
<br>
of societies all around the world always exhibit.
<br>
<p>Eugenics (or genetic engineering) could accomplish (1), but for
<br>
(2), only time and the incremental processes of economic advance
<br>
fostered by freedom and liberty will help.
