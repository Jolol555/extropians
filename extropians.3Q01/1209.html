<p>If you can build an automated system that deals with them, then it does.
<br>
Equipping each soldier with a bullet backtrack system (which is, in
<br>
fact, a proven technology, just not portable at this time) allows them
<br>
to sight the source and take it out.

<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; I agree, I wish it were different but that's the way it is and I see no signs of that

<p>Says who? Nations who claim to have no desire to initiate attack against
<br>
others can demonstrate their word in deeds by eliminating their nuclear
<br>
stockpiles and only having defensive systems, thus setting a moral
<br>
example for other nations to follow. This is where public opinion can
<br>
and does have great impact, as much as it has for the land mine issue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;blowing one up is a big reduction in enemy asset
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not so, most H bombs would just shake the charred bones and rubble around anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If 99.9% fail to reach their target it doesn't matter, .1% is more than enough to kill a nation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any nation. The defense must be virtually 100% perfect or it's not worth building.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conclusion: it's not worth building.
</em><br>
<p>Not so, John. If an H-bomb costs $10 million, and a country has 10,000
<br>
of them, thats a $100 billion asset. Lets say an H bomb can cause $1
<br>
billion in damage, on average, then an attacker would have to get at
<br>
least 100 through a defensive system to break even on the cost/benefit
<br>
of the attack (this is assuming the defender doesn't reply with an
<br>
attack of its own). If the attacker throws all 10,000 bombs into the
<br>
attack, then with a 99.9% defensive rate, only 10 bombs get through,
<br>
doing $10 billion in damage, which is a return on investment of -90%.
<br>
<p>Now, lets say that the defensive system is only 90% effective, so that
<br>
1000 bombs get through, doing $1 trillion in damage, the immediate
<br>
return is 1000%, but the attacker doesn't have their own defensive
<br>
system, and the defender replies with their own attack of only 2000
<br>
bombs, at a cost of $20 billion, doing $2 trillion in damage to the
<br>
enemy, for a return of 10,000% on the investment, and doing double the
<br>
damage to the enemy for 1/10th of the cost. Thus, the deterrent value of
<br>
a smaller nuke force is amplified by a defensive system by a great
<br>
degree. Nations with defensive systems can afford to reduce their
<br>
nuclear arsenals.
<br>
<p>If every major power has the same or similar technology, then the
<br>
deterrent value of each remains the same, and each finds it more cost
<br>
effective to reduce their nuclear arsenals while beefing up their
<br>
defensive system to be more effective.
