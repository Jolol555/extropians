Mike Lorrey writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no doubt that people [on both sides] generally leap to opinions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on desires first, only later to be tempered, changed or confirmed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by reasoned argument, especially when people have made rather large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional investments in a given position over a protracted period like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an election cycle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is important to look at is what measures one is willing to consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to confirm their own emotionally vested opinion.
</em><br>
<p>[partisan remarks elided and reposted to the thread &quot;GOP standards
<br>
were higher than DEM standards]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This behavior demonstrates who is truly extreme and who is not...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; So the question is: how far are you willing to go to support your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs before you reconsider them? How much contradictory fact are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to ignore before you start to doubt the validity of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs?  These questions indicate the reasonableness or extremism of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but it's enormously difficult to objectively determine &quot;how
<br>
much contradictory fact you are willing to ignore&quot;.  It's almost
<br>
impossible, and there are extremely few occasions where I think
<br>
that I've succeeded (personally).  My best moments occur when I've
<br>
located some obscure contradictory memes on a subject, and can let
<br>
them fight it out.  Or after I'm able to (truthfully) decide that
<br>
I don't have enough information, and go looking for some.  You've
<br>
probably read Robin's suggestions in this thread; I will criticize
<br>
them shortly.
