<p>A lot of those people were drafted, so they really didn't go willingly.
<br>
Recall also the limitations of freedom at that time.  I'm not talking about
<br>
having lights on and stuff like that, but limits on criticizing the
<br>
government.
<br>
<p>Plus, it's quite clear FDR manipulated the nation into war and then made
<br>
that war a total one by calling for nothing less unconditional surrender.
<br>
<p>The result was not freedom but forty years of Cold War with the world
<br>
divided between two nuclear armed camps wherein fully one third of the
<br>
planet was under the sway of communist dictatorship and the rest was mostly
<br>
authoritarian.  Kind of like saving people from cholera by giving them
<br>
typhoid.
<br>
<p>War is the health of the state, as someone once said.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They know the price of freedom. The only way to make sure terrorist are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eradicated is to make sure theres no country for them to hide in. Those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries now hiding terrorist are as guilty as the people flying the
</em><br>
plane.
<br>
<em>&gt; Bomb their entire countries dust.
</em><br>
<p>With that logic, why not exterminate the species -- or lop a few asteroids
<br>
at the Earth.  Surely, if there's no life, there's no terrorism!  That's
<br>
thinking exactly like many of the terrorists and their bedfellows.
<br>
<p>Extropians, transhumanists, and freedom lovers should have a more sober,
<br>
rational response ready.  We should not become animals to fight off animals.
<br>
<p>Later!
