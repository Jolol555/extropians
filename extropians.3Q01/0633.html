Lee said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So are we homing in, by any chance at all, on a mutually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;useful meaning?  That is, it sounds to me that &quot;spirituality&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might be for many of us---certainly not all---the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Spirituality:  a deep appreciation of something so emotionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compelling that it becomes a form of reverance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now, I must also candidly say that there is one huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem with any such explanation or definition, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's this:  many people will ADAMANTLY resist any such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reduction to concrete words or concepts for these reasons:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1.  such an active reduction is itself rational/scientific,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     and therefore *itself* not emotionally compelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2.  any such description is &quot;third person&quot; instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &quot;first person&quot;---hence &quot;detached&quot;, &quot;analytic&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &quot;unfeeling&quot;, and so on.  (Those same people will,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     for example, frequently insist that first person
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     consciousness or pain can never be explained.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&lt;big snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So it comes down to this:  the people who claim to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spiritual in most cases (a) have a deep appreciation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of things, probably foremost among them the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;itself, to the point of reverance, and (b) feel inclined
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to talk about it, or to communicate it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;People who have no use for &quot;spirituality&quot; or &quot;religiosity&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;usually---although perhaps having equally deep appreciation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(or perhaps not, who can really say?)---hardly ever feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worshipful, reverent, or deeply respectful (of non-sentience).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Moreover, they feel awkward or even self-indulgent when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trying to communicate such appreciations or profound feelings.
</em><br>
<p>Although I kept out of the recent religion war, I seem to have sparked it 
<br>
off by my comments about &quot;sin&quot; and &quot;spirituality&quot;. Sorry about that (though 
<br>
I did say that I was prepared to bracket off the &quot;spirituality&quot; isssue &lt;g&gt;).
<br>
<p>What Lee has said here makes a fair bit of sense to me. I remain of the view 
<br>
that references to a spiritual domain (when made by people who are not 
<br>
religious believers, etc), refer to deep personal feelings, aesthetic 
<br>
values, etc. I also think that there is a tendency in our society not to 
<br>
wish to refer to issues or values as &quot;aesthetic&quot; because it somehow sounds 
<br>
too weak (as in &quot;mere aesthetic value&quot;). When we find value in art, beauty, 
<br>
culture or the awe- (or joy-) inspiring aspects of the physical world, we 
<br>
are tempted to refer to this as &quot;spiritual&quot; value. I see it as aesthetic 
<br>
value but add that aesthetic dimension of life is extremely important.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I should stop resisting this usage of &quot;spiritual&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;spirituality&quot;; I'll have to think about that. The posts from Samantha, 
<br>
Amara and now Lee make me feel much less dogmatic than when I first 
<br>
mentioned the point a few weeks ago. All the same, I remain uncomfortable 
<br>
with these words for reasons I have explained previously and which J.R. and 
<br>
others have elaborated.
<br>
<p>My other example of a word that should be dropped, &quot;sin&quot;, I have no doubts 
<br>
about (nor is it an original suggestion of mine). In the end, we *seem* to 
<br>
have a consensus that this word contains wrong implications of God's anger 
<br>
etc, etc and should be dropped.
<br>
<p>Cheers
<br>
<p>Russell
<br>
<p><p>(Now, adapting J.R.'s approach, here's a semi-random list of useful 
<br>
hypotheses, memes, etc:
<br>
<p>philosophy; science; intellectual adventure; science fiction; freedom of 
<br>
inquiry, thought, speech and expression; limited government; creativity; 
<br>
polyamory; self-development; atheism; evolutionary explanations; 
<br>
transhumanism...)
