<em>&gt; &gt; I would point out that U.S. support for Israel is not top

<em>&gt; &gt; of the complaints list for many Islamists, particularly the ones around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Osama Bin Laden. They're more bothered about the continuing war on Iraq and

</em><br>

<em>&gt; If they're bothered about the war on Iraq, they're nuts. If they're bothered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about Western support for the House of Saud, they should mind their own damned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business. But if they're bothered about US support for Israel, then I'd tend
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Debatable, JR. Many of the bin Laden types are Saudi citizens or
<br>
ex-citizens. Them being pissed at our support of the Saud family could
<br>
rationally be looked at in the same light as the degree to which many of
<br>
us looked at the Communist Chinese government support of the Clinton
<br>
Administration. I'm sure that there are many Saudi citizens that wish
<br>
they had a process like impeachment. Only a few are evidently willing to
<br>
resort to violence instead. What bothers me is that they attack us
<br>
rather than the Saudi family itself. Why do we not see more anti-Saud
<br>
terrorism in Arabia itself? Perhaps it is because violence against
<br>
infidels is far more acceptable than against other believers.
