<em>&gt;&gt; In Argentina,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  there is still a sad kind of institutional thinking inside security forces
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  that originates on the doctrines and methods of the last dictatorship.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That's odd.  Usually the collapse of dictatorial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regimes for democratic ones leaves regimes which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are hyper-touchy about authoritarian methods.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would think the methods of the Argentinian facist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regime of 76-83 would be thoroughly discredited, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between the Disappeared and the Falklands War.
</em><br>
<p>I think the explanation is to be found in the political strength the
<br>
army accumulated during the 50 years that they kept taking over the
<br>
government once and again, every time they didn't like the way
<br>
the democratic governments were acting. In spite of the discredit,
<br>
they managed to leave government in 83 with a big part of that strenght
<br>
intact (the backing up of the local landlords and their oligopolies
<br>
never weakened, as for them all the killings were all right). This
<br>
can be seen in the final destiny of the legal prosecution of Process
<br>
members for human right violations: after some covert threats and
<br>
numerous overt rebellions by army officers, the trials were silently
<br>
swept under the carpet and an amnesty law declared. Once that was
<br>
safe and sound, the army's political strength was emptied by the
<br>
natural retirement of the old dinosaurs, and the shift of the
<br>
landlords/oligopolies to use financial pressure with deadly effects
<br>
to get their points across in a cleaner way. The institutional culture,
<br>
however, has very much remained in place in the security forces. The
<br>
participation of high officers of the army and the federal police
<br>
in the bombing of jewish institutions in Buenos Aires is proof enough,
<br>
I think.
