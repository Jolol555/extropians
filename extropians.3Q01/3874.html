Today in Oz, the radio Science Show broadcast the final ep in a 6-part
<br>
series on innovation. 
<br>
<p><a href="http://abc.net.au/science/wings/episode6.htm">http://abc.net.au/science/wings/episode6.htm</a>
<br>
<p>The transcript isn't there yet, but you can check out the names of
<br>
dignitaries yacking on abt the ethics of it all. Guy Rundle, editor of the
<br>
[post?]marxist journal ARENA, explained how antibiotics were the classic
<br>
instance of global corporate science gone mad. First they helped us,
<br>
admittedly, by saving hundreds of thousands of lives. Then they were
<br>
reckless introduced into animal feedstocks, etc, which created the climate
<br>
for the evolution of... resistant superbugs! Case closed, game &amp; match!
<br>
<p>I'd been musing on this very example last night, wondering how to get
<br>
across to ordinary folks how ludicrous it seems to me. But my logic and
<br>
facts might be in error, so I'd like to run my riposte past the biologists
<br>
on the list:
<br>
<p>`Superbugs', so-called, are not some new and unheralded kind of omnipotent
<br>
monster bacterium. (And of course they can't be any kind of virus, because
<br>
antibiotics shouldn't affect those critters--unless altering the background
<br>
ecological mix does somehow skew the norm of reaction for viri.) 
<br>
<p>What they are is, by definition, *bacteria resistant to a particular
<br>
antibiotic*, or perhaps a family of similar antibiotics.
<br>
<p>That means that their evolution, at worst, has reverted the balance of play
<br>
to the way it was originally.
<br>
<p>*Except* that, in the meantime, monocultural agribiz has reduced the
<br>
genetic diversity of crops, making widespread variants especially
<br>
vulnerable to the rebound diseases. That's not the fault of antibiotics
<br>
*per se*, though. It might be a very good reason to worry about excessively
<br>
centralized and massively advertised corporate food production.
<br>
<p>My feeling is that one needs to be very careful in describing the real
<br>
problem(s), and allocating blame. As far as I can see, *nobody* has been
<br>
harmed by applying antibiotics to ill humans. I and many others are now
<br>
alive because of them. If we now face, at worst, reversion to a condition
<br>
where resistant bacterial diseases roam the world unchecked, that's very
<br>
sad--not because of the brief, blessed epoch of cheap, effective
<br>
antibiotics, but because it's at an end. 
<br>
<p>In fact, I doubt that it *is* at an end, because soon our medical knowledge
<br>
will be so far advanced by genomics, proteomics etc that we'll outdo even
<br>
the vast genetic algorithm factories of the natural world (i.e., our own
<br>
bodies and those of our livestock, where the bugs breed and mutate).
<br>
<p>If that's true, resistance will be, for the superbugs, futile. And even if
<br>
it's not true, the supposed `superbugs' provide no evidence at all that we
<br>
have entered a new era of unprecedented malignancy--Gaia `fighting back',
<br>
as some dopes like to think of it. It's just, at worst, a return to
<br>
ecological business as usual.
<br>
<p>Any comments, Robert, Curt, Carol, you-all?
<br>
