</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what's really going on here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had a friend over the course of a couple of decades who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did the same thing.  Despite having some of the deepest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversations of my life with him, I never did understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why.  Perhaps the answer will emerge in this medium.  Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an answer will emerge if we try.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To me the questions are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Why do some people gladly debunk what they see as clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    falsehoods where others, equally skeptical, don't want to?
</em><br>
<p>Because:
<br>
<p>a) we don't see them as clear falsehoods;
<br>
<p>b) perhaps we don't consider skepticism inherently and
<br>
unquestionably true or good for all purposes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Why do the latter embrace terms, e.g., &quot;spirituality&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &quot;synchronicity&quot; overwhelmingly used by people who mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    things completely different from them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I can point you to literature and people who mean by
<br>
spirituality a lot of what I mean by it.  There are levels of
<br>
spirituality and different aspects just as they are in many
<br>
other human enterprises ane conceptual systems.  The most common
<br>
views are not privileged to define what terms mean.   
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; About the latter question, there is no shortage of words and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phrases in English to distinguish shades of belief.  Articulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people (which these people invariably are) could easily always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find suitable substitution phrases---but they didn't do so, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mostly resist doing so.  Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Becaue what I am speaking of is spiritual in the truest sense I
<br>
know and to call it anything else is imho improper.  It is also
<br>
essential if one is to reclaim spirituality from the worse of
<br>
the luddites and from the conceptual shrinking it into something
<br>
easily dismissed that too easily misses and disowns what I
<br>
believe is important in it.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Now a semanticist might retort, &quot;because the term in question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has so many favorable semantic links, that it's very useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the purposes of communication&quot;.  But if this were the case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you'd see people who use terms like &quot;God&quot;, &quot;spirituality&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and &quot;synchronicity&quot; qualifying their remarks.  In other words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the terms would always be followed by words like &quot;in the sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of...&quot;, or &quot;-like&quot;, or surrounded by scare-quotes.  But it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't happen.  Why?  (Apologies to Samantha here: she has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made it clear that she does have a lot of beliefs that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty far away from materialism---beliefs not supported by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any scientific theories.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>True.  Fortunately, much of life runs along quite well without
<br>
being fully explained or even explainable by science.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; So can anyone explain what is going on?
</em><br>
<p>I try.  Or at least I do when I think a bit of signal can get
<br>
through.
