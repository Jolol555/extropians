<p>Agreed.  And can you imagine the impact when they manage to rig this
<br>
for grains (esp. wheat, corn, &amp; rice)?  Plug in a unit or two at your
<br>
local bakery, and it could become a completely self-sufficient food
<br>
producer (except for electricity - from solar panels, perhaps? - and
<br>
water, and presumably nitrogen from the air).  Even some large
<br>
residences, such as hotels or institutions (like military bases and
<br>
universities), might be able to consume 100% of the daily output of
<br>
such a grain producer themselves, even if they couldn't consume several
<br>
hundred heads of lettuce a day.
<br>
<p>Now, if only they could come up with a similar system for producing
<br>
meat and other animal products...say, take a cancerous muscle cell from
<br>
a cow's thigh, make sure its cancerous properties do not make it
<br>
dangerous to those who eat it, then immerse it in a nutrient bath to
<br>
get it to grow forever, applying electric stimulation to get the right
<br>
texture and harvesting off chunks every so often.  Or maybe engineer a
<br>
peanut (or other protein-producing vegetable or fruit) to grow large
<br>
and have a meat-like texture and flavor...
