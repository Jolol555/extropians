<p><em>&gt; &gt;P.S. Standing challenge to any of you liberals out there:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;top that!  Confess how you have articulated to yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;something as explosive as &quot;Fred Reed's piece is racist&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;but with the shoe on the other foot, and how you, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;though it was exceedingly painful, had to give huge aid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and comfort to your ideological opponents.  (P.P.S.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;don't think any of them will.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Um, Lee, who do you think of as a &quot;liberal&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>I apologize for my U.S. based coordinate system.  I
<br>
have read, but forget like many others, how slippery
<br>
the term is internationally.  Let me revise my 
<br>
challenge:  it's to U.S. liberals only.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You know a lot about my ethical and political views by now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do I count?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so, although my usual coordinates fail to 
<br>
entirely apply.  You have indeed made too many libertarian
<br>
assertions to be a U.S. liberal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The word &quot;liberal&quot; tends to mean something different over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here and it has many different nuances historically.
</em><br>
<p>Some of us need to stop using the word unqualifyingly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, who on this list counts as one of my ideological opponents? Daniel, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jerry and Mike because they are (I think) full-on libertarians whereas I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have some libertarian tendencies but also a lot of theoretical and practical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerns about formal libertarian systems of thought? Samantha, who has a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tendency to spirituality whereas I am a self-confessed ferocious atheist? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You because you seem to have a social conservative streak whereas I don't?
</em><br>
<p>You are too centrist to have perpetual ideological adversaries,
<br>
in my opinion.  (Again, this is probably from a U.S. perspective.)
<br>
But there is a marvelous reality to the political spectrum, which
<br>
I and my little liberal friend discovered when we were in 7th grade.
<br>
It's real, and in so amazingly many cases quite reliable.  Now, as
<br>
as libertarian-conservative---I am exactly on the midpoint between
<br>
the two on the Nolan chart---I acknowledge the Nolan chart as an
<br>
even better model of this landscape (for the U.S. people, at least)
<br>
Take the test yourself!  <a href="http://www.self-gov.org/quiz.html">http://www.self-gov.org/quiz.html</a>  Tell me
<br>
where you land.  It's quick and easy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have often defended people who are my &quot;opponents&quot;, in various senses, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone out of my way to give credit to them or their ideas where it is due. 
</em><br>
<p>I am not at all surprised, considering your tone, demeanor, reasonableness,
<br>
and open-mindedness.
<br>
<p>Lee
