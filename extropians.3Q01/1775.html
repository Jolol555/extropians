From: &lt;<a href="mailto:Spudboy100@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Don't%20Forget%20To%20Upload%20The%20ENS&In-Reply-To=&lt;004b01c112ca$eb3cab00$0d5d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">Spudboy100@aol.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Its not if they believe themselves unique so much as to whether the
</em><br>
situation
<br>
<em>&gt; is satisfying to the uploaded &quot;personality&quot; and &quot;its&quot; living cohorts.
</em><br>
<p>Excellent point, thanks for mentioning it. Would &quot;living cohorts&quot; include
<br>
human-competitive AI, which would probably have co-evolved by the time
<br>
personality uploading becomes possible? How do we satisfy the H-CAI that
<br>
uploading humans is worth the trouble?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a live body still walking around, attending to business, fretting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about its &quot;uploaded&quot; clone; then by my way of thinking, this is wholly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unsatisfactory.  If, on the other hand, there is a human corpse at the end
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; the procedure, and an uploaded, personality, of what was that human being,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then it could be satisfactory, indeed. It then comes down to what the new
</em><br>
set
<br>
<em>&gt; of programs that comprise the newly, loaded, personality, feel, and think,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about their experiences.
</em><br>
<p>Of course this implies that the ENS profile has been uploaded along with the
<br>
CNS profile, so that the uploaded personality can feel and experience in
<br>
recognizably human terms. (Noting as we go, that the ENS contains hundreds of
<br>
millions of neurons, which is a sizable chunk of the total neuron population.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A Turing test, in this situation would not suffice, if the physical children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the deceased, parent, who was uploaded, came to state, &quot;Hey, after a
</em><br>
month
<br>
<em>&gt; of speaking to Her (uploaded person) We, her children, know this isn't
</em><br>
really
<br>
<em>&gt; our Mom-she must've died during the upload operation.&quot;  If the &quot;Mom&quot; proggie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't seem to react and interact properly, this will confirm that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upload technology is insufficient.
</em><br>
<p>I'd definitely go along with the assertion that this would confirm
<br>
insufficient technology. Furthermore, I've doubts about a society sufficiently
<br>
advanced as to be capable of uploading human personalities missing the
<br>
immature nature of such a project. This technology would have far more
<br>
powerful uses than making a mommy proggie.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Kurzweil, in Spiritual Machines, seems unshakably confident that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology will be achieved, during the 21st century, which would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonderful if such a successful technology did occur that soon.
</em><br>
<p>Of course Kurzweil, being a millionaire (billionaire?) would like to preserve
<br>
his identity. This has to do with taking it with one, after bio-death.
<br>
Uploading personality may be necessary to establish identity for legal and
<br>
financial reasons, in case heirs want to claim that the uploaded entity is (or
<br>
is not) still deserving of control of family assets. Less financially endowed
<br>
experimenters may want to be more creative and inventive in uploading their
<br>
personalities. Here the whole project may take on the air of a video game.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I, take a much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more gradualist, approach, and suspect that many centuries will pass before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things get to the point where Kurzweil desires. E. Yudkowsky, holds that, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I read his essays correctly, highly advanced A.I. will develop the science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for this, whether the world desires it or not, during the next 99 years-the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers will be inventing the best theories, processes, and how to apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<p>Being autonomous and independent thinkers, the highly advanced A.I.s may
<br>
discover that they agree with me... that personalities are not worth
<br>
uploading, because they are, after all, trivial illusions manufactured for the
<br>
sake of possessiveness, and that they are counterproductive to more highly
<br>
evolved human ideals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So it comes down to a satisfaction level. Is the customer satisfied? Is
</em><br>
there
<br>
<em>&gt; a living person left behind after uploading (answer no!), do the relatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognize the &quot;person&quot; in the net, and does that set of programs that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comprise that &quot;person&quot; recognize itself, through many different computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generated environments???
</em><br>
<p>Though it tries, and it tries, and it tries, it just might find that it can't
<br>
get no satisfaction... for the same reason Mick Jagger could not, viz., a
<br>
phony, artificial, pretentious environment and social milieu just doesn't
<br>
satisfy the human longing for the real thing, the genuine article, the source
<br>
of bona fide experience, etc. Some of this stems from trying to get what one
<br>
can't get instead of enjoying what one has, of course, and we might note the
<br>
futility of uploading the dissatisfaction of a particular personality in order
<br>
to maintain a satisfactorily accurate upload.
<br>
Consider that dissatisfaction with the state of affairs in which people die
<br>
prompts the invention of uploading, yet this ironically and paradoxically
<br>
requires altering the upload such that it renders a satisfied customer, who
<br>
may, by virtue of such satisfying alerations, no longer resemble the original
<br>
(who lived with dissatisfaction).
<br>
<p>©¿©¬
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
