<em>&gt; It is direct and unfiltered by thinking about

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the case if accompanied or diluted by thinking.
</em><br>
<p>J.R., your writings are getting more and more mystical.  I have asked you
<br>
before, and I must ask you again:  Have you added science to your list of
<br>
useless hypotheses?  You seem to be finding more and more ways to come to
<br>
conclusions while bypassing critical thinking, scientific method, and the
<br>
like.  You almost seem to have the mystical expectation that &quot;truth&quot; will
<br>
just be known to you, and that attempts to find the truth will fail.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If one remembers it, then that one will not ask for evidence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right? And if one persists in forgetting, then evidence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not possible.  The kind of memory referred to here is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind that one experiences when one &quot;remembers oneself.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>You sometimes seem concerned that people miss your points.  I think this is
<br>
because nobody can understand what you are talking about.  The above
<br>
sentences seem to be more like a religious stream-of-consciousness rather
<br>
than a discussion with someone else.  You seem to be referencing implied
<br>
concepts with your words that only you seem to know about.  They are not
<br>
explicitly included in your postings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps the word &quot;mind&quot; obscures the issue, because this word can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpreted in more than one way. So I say parts of the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seek control, and as the brain comes to recognize and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acknowledge the unity of reality, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understands that control is an illusion.
</em><br>
<p>To be honest, I cannot fathom your reality where you experience direct truth
<br>
without thought, consciousness or mind.  It is always interesting to read
<br>
your posts, but I have the constant feeling that I must be missing
<br>
something.  Do you have a reference for your belief system, or a webpage, or
<br>
a name for the world-view you espouse?
