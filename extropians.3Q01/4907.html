<p>Aw, c'mon, Russell. If certain unnamed, self declared 'liberals' around
<br>
here are going to continue to claim that I, and others, are somehow
<br>
'racist', then there is no reason I cannot be as loose in my definitions
<br>
when I describe those who espouse authoritarian policies. Granted,
<br>
fascism is as much a subset of authoritarianism as Naziims is a subset
<br>
of fascism, but at least I can objectively tell the difference (and
<br>
similarity) between a national socialist and an international socialist,
<br>
as much as I can tell the differences (and the similarities) between
<br>
Nietche and Dhugashvili.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is incorrect to call them fascists. It is also not smart to dismiss
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this impatient way. 
</em><br>
<p>Whether their concerns are based on fascist political theory or not is
<br>
immaterial. How they wish to implement the prescriptions for their
<br>
concerns is, in fact, based on fascist political theory, and how they
<br>
conduct their campaigns in the streets with propaganda, disinformation,
<br>
and terror is, in fact, based on fascist political theory. Those who
<br>
insist you can only judge someone by their intent, and not their acts,
<br>
are simply espousing another form of justifying means by the ends.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I occasionally lose my patience and say they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational or superstitious. I'm going to try to cut down on this. I have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compunction in pointing out that they are illiberal. But we have to try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer them as reasonably and sweetly as we can bring ourselves to.
</em><br>
<p>Refusing to call a spade a spade aids in their disinformation and
<br>
propaganda, and lends them an undeserved legitimacy.
