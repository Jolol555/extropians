<em>&gt; Here's an interesting tidbit: a friend of mine who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studied 'pyramid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power' for a while told me that electron microscope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; photographs had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shown conclusively that putting razor blades in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pyramid had no effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatsoever or their sharpness (or subsequent dulling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when used).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nonetheless when he did this he used the same blade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for months.
</em><br>
<p>This happens to me on a regular basis with no pyramid.
<br>
Other than my head, the little bit of hair I have is
<br>
very thin, colorless, and  more like duck down. Some
<br>
of my razors have lasted a year. Maybe your friend is
<br>
this way?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or to put it another way: Randi's lab is deep in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'Slow Zone'. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't expect anything unusual to happen there.
</em><br>
<p>I would expect some phenomenal things to happen there
<br>
if anyone took him up on his offer. Actually, it would
<br>
be a fun thing to do--there are many claims of psychic
<br>
phenomenon that ought to be able to be reproduced
<br>
*easily* in a lab, hostile or not. Maybe in another
<br>
lab that is not so hostile, with a ton of observers.
<br>
<p>Maybe it is about time, once and for all. Any ideas?
<br>
