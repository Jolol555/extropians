<p>
I just got home from watching AI and all I can say is it's the best movie I've
<br>
seen in years, many years. It's visually beautiful, the kid is one incredible
<br>
actor, and most important of all it worked as a drama. As for the science,
<br>
well a movie, even a science fiction movie, is not a science treatise but
<br>
still it shouldn't have anything that would make an educated man groan;
<br>
I didn't groan, not once. Well, ok, there was something at the very end that
<br>
might be a bit doggy, but by then you're dealing with something so advanced,
<br>
so unfathomable, it didn't bother me much. Also a big corporation that's smart
<br>
enough to make a robot as sophisticated as David is unlikely to do a few things
<br>
depicted in the film that were sort of dumb, but I confess these objections didn't
<br>
occur to me until the movie was over and they did advance the plot so I'll cut
<br>
the movie people a little slack.
<br>
<p>I am certain time will be kind to this movie, I think this is the sort of film that
<br>
will improve each time you see it. I am also certain that the professional
<br>
movie reviewers who panned it in the year 2001 will be very embarrassed
<br>
by their negative articles 10 years from now.
