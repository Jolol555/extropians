<p>I'm pretty sure any black holes that size evaporate over times

much greater than the current age of the universe.
<br>
<p>The note:

<br>
seems to suggest that the evaporation time proportional
<br>
to the cube of the mass.  (I'm surpsised that Google
<br>
of &quot;Black Hole evaporation calculator&quot; didn't turn up
<br>
a java or javascript application for this -- what do
<br>
you know, something the net doesn't know yet...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, you are assuming that they use silicon/electron based computation.
</em><br>
<p>Michael Franks does, but I generally don't.  If you can keep them really
<br>
cold, you would use Lihharev's RSFQ logic elements that I believe are
<br>
made out of silicon.  For MBrains my calculations are based on Eric's
<br>
rod-logic computers which are built primarily out of carbon.  If you
<br>
used Eric &amp; Ralph's helical logic, you probably use sapphire so that's
<br>
aluminium &amp; oxygen.  Since you use up all the material in a solar
<br>
system, you probably have computers built out of &quot;almost&quot; everything
<br>
available.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If instead they use photon/quantum well based computation, they could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construct on any more populous substrate, from lithium and carbon, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Li is a fairly rare element (I assume you are talking about things
<br>
like lithium niobate crystals which are used for frequency doubling).
<br>
It isn't clear that you need that.  If you can build nanoscale lasers
<br>
you may be able to directly get the frequencies you desire.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd look for unusual concentrations of elements popular in laser
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms: fluoride, CO2, etc. which would be needed to supply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentred high power photons for computing nodes.
</em><br>
<p>Then you probably want GaAs or InP, those are the most common
<br>
materials for solid state laser devices.  But you are *never*
<br>
going to have the right ratios of any hetero-elemental material.
<br>
So you might as well dump the rest of the stuff back into your
<br>
star for recycling (if you don't feed it to a breeder reactor).

<p>I've sent an email note into the lead author of the Nature article
<br>
as to whether existing ground based spectroscopes (say on
<br>
the Keck) could provide this at M22's distance for red/white
<br>
dwarf stars.  He's on vacation for the rest of July unfortunately
<br>
so I don't expect an answer soon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How about a prediction about the motions of these objects?
</em><br>
<p>Scot Stride from JPL pointed out to me that the unresolved
<br>
observations, interpreted as planetary mass objects, are
<br>
making the transits at extremely high speeds.  I agreed with
<br>
him and suggested a couple of possible reasons:
<br>
(a) Perhaps the objects are orbiting around the outside
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the cluster itself (maybe Spike would comment on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether the velocity range 0.25 M_jupiter objects orbiting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around 10^5 - 10^6 M_sun objects is faster or slower than typical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planetary orbital velocities).
<br>
(b) If you are orbiting through a galactic cluster you may
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want to limit the length of time you are &quot;near&quot; the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stars to limit heat and/or radiation exposure.
<br>
(c) There is possibly an information transfer theoretic argument
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that says, if you are transfering densely packed information
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as internode &quot;probes&quot;, then the communication throughput is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not limited by the probe launch or receipt time, but instead
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the time it takes you to reach the next launch/receipt point
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the cluster.  If that argument has some merit, then the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;objects may select orbits that have relatively high velocities.
<br>
<p>(I'll freely admit these are weak arguments and that I need to
<br>
think about it some more.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would you not expect to find them not attached to stars?
</em><br>
<p>A classical Jupiter Brain, presumably has to get power
<br>
someplace, so I'd expect to find it around a star with
<br>
an array of solar collectors at its disposal.  A fusion
<br>
reactor powered Matrioshka Brain doesn't have that restriction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How close to a star would you expect to find them?
</em><br>
<p>The paper says the objects are at least several AU from the
<br>
nearest star.  One could make an argument that Jupiter
<br>
Brains utilizing a solar power source could optimize
<br>
their architecture by harvesting the solar power using
<br>
collectors close to the star, but beam the energy to a remote
<br>
location (Jupiter-to-Pluto orbit say) so that it isn't
<br>
receiving a lot of IR exposure from the star and has
<br>
an unpolluted region of space in which to setup large
<br>
telescope arrays.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If not attached, how fast would they be drifting between stars?
</em><br>
<p>If the information transfer argument above doesn't hold,
<br>
then you would probably adopt a speed that minimizes
<br>
the matter &amp; energy expense of orbital course corrections.
<br>
That means you are likely to do an N-body simulation of the
<br>
entire cluster, predict to the limits of chaos theory
<br>
what the least expensive (long term &quot;safest&quot;) orbits are
<br>
and then put yourself into one of those.  I suspect the
<br>
velocity varies significantly depending on how you got
<br>
to the cluster, how massive it is, whether you orbit
<br>
around it or through it, etc.
<br>
<p>In short, I don't think one can make &quot;good&quot; predictions
<br>
other than spectral characteristics at this point.
<br>
Its likely that the variety of astroengineered supercomputers
<br>
may have characteristics as different as the variety of stars.
<br>
<p>I'm going to resist getting dragged into the discussion between
<br>
Eugene &amp; Daniel regarding colonization, interstellar wars, etc.
<br>
because I believe its simply rehashing old material.
