<p><em>&gt; There is plenty of evidence to show that the racial structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of  poverty is the result of racism, not a result of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherent inferiority or superiority.
</em><br>
<p>Those are not the only possibilities.  The separate histories,
<br>
traditions, and cultures of groups have a tremendous effect on
<br>
their wealth or poverty.  See Thomas Sowell's &quot;Migrations and
<br>
Cultures&quot; for an extraordinarily complete list of examples.
<br>
<p>Additionally, it also depends on what you mean by &quot;inherent&quot;.
<br>
Do you mean inherent in the sense of an almost inescapable
<br>
attribute of something, such as &quot;depending on photosynthesis
<br>
for energy is an inherent characteristic of plants&quot;, or do
<br>
you mean inherent in the sense of a statistical attribute
<br>
that happens in fact to show up in some people of a particular
<br>
description or location, e.g., &quot;a greater incidence of sickle-cell
<br>
anemia is inherent in the U.S. black population than the population
<br>
at large&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am disappointed that a racist thread has turned up on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the extropians list.
</em><br>
<p>I have said repeatedly that this should be looked upon as a
<br>
welcome challenge to be met, but there has been no response to
<br>
my statement.  Of course, you don't mean &quot;racist thread&quot;, you
<br>
mean a discussion of racism.  I repeat, if extropians simply
<br>
cannot handle uncomfortable ideas, then how in the world can
<br>
we ever hope that non-extropians should come to grips with
<br>
cloning, uploading, immortality, or the Spike?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The denials of racism by some of the (plonked) individuals here 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remind me of a statement by someone I knew years ago: &quot;I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racist. I can't help that blacks are stupid.&quot; I was astonished,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but no amount of explanation could convince him of the absurdity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what he said.
</em><br>
<p>Wow!  First, do you know that &quot;plonked&quot; means that someone
<br>
has engaged an automatic process by which (roughly speaking)
<br>
a certain person's posts never even get to his mailbox?
<br>
If this isn't a frightened tactic of self-censorship, then
<br>
I don't know what is.  (I hasten to add, that quite often
<br>
experienced discussion list members employ plonking not to
<br>
prevent their eyes from meeting disagreeable points of view,
<br>
but rather because someone's posts over a great deal of time
<br>
have shown themselves to be without content, or too long, or
<br>
some other non-partisan cause.)
<br>
<p>Second, what that person said
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm not racist. I can't help that blacks are stupid.&quot;
<br>
<p>is *not* necessarily absurd, as you claim.  It may be entirely
<br>
wrong; it may be a gross over-generalization; it may be so
<br>
utterly an unqualified assertion that it absolutely demands
<br>
refutation---but it's not absurd.  As Jerry Mitchell has written,
<br>
we must very precisely face square-on those assertions with which
<br>
we disagree, if we are not to simply paper them over, and let
<br>
their inaccuracy fester.  Evidently, you did not dismiss that
<br>
person's claim out of hand, but tried to reason very closely
<br>
(in a hopefully open-minded way, where your sincere desire for
<br>
the truth did not display undue disdain on your part).  Good for you.
<br>
<p>Lee
