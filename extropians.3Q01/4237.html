</em><br>
<p><p>This is a rather prejudiced way to express certain strains in
<br>
transhumanism imo.  I think it is too early to assume much about
<br>
what is and is not a reasonable and workable view.  Brain/minds
<br>
at the current level are relatively inefficient and bound up by
<br>
evolutionary patterns that make them rather biased, although
<br>
&quot;impure&quot; is going too far.  If mind can be captured and
<br>
transferred from brain to upload &quot;brain&quot; in software and perhaps
<br>
downloaded into various vehicles then there is a degree of
<br>
support for a sort of mind/body dualism. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I see it, uploads are still going to be embodied. As I argued at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TransVision 00 in London, uploads might actually be more obsessed with their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bodies than we are currently! The reason is that an upload doesn't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lose his body when he is uploaded, but rather gains an extra body: a primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embodiment as computer hardware and associated electricity patterns, as well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the emulation of his original flesh body. 
</em><br>
<p>It is too early to assume that such an emulation will be always
<br>
a part of being an upload.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The emulation is necessary since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our brains are wired to interact with the world through the body and cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily do this without a very close analog to the original body. 
</em><br>
<p>But we will not have a &quot;brain&quot; in the old sense.  It remains to
<br>
be seen how much the mind requires such an emulation to stay
<br>
sane and functional.  It remains to be seen whether mind can
<br>
reprogram itself to not be as tied to such an emulation or not. 
<br>
If we cannot, then Moravec's argument that the true AI/AC will
<br>
always be more adept in cyberia seems unanswerable. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Also, many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our emotional states seem to be based not just in our brain neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; networks but use bodily states as markers (the somatic marker hypothesis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Antonio Damasio). Over time this emulation might be changed, outgrown and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually discarded, but that will take plenty of time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK.  Although I don't think we can make much of a guess about
<br>
how much realtime this will take yet.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In the meantime the upload - who is likely not directly aware of the primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational body - will have to come to terms with his new ontological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; status. I have a hard time imagining that uploads would not often try to feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if their thoughts or visceral feelings have become somehow different. If any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective difference is experienced, that will be felt as deeply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant, and different uploads might react very differently to it - some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might want to tune their bodies to fit their old selves, others might wear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the difference as a badge denoting their new status and others will begin to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; play around with the possibilities of changing their bodies. So in the end, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe uploads will be firmly embodied beings, it is just that their bodies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will likely be very different from anything we consider bodies today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how your conclusion follows from your exploration. 
<br>
Why &quot;firmly embodied&quot;?  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think transhumanism needs a good perspective of embodiment to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becoming dualist or cybergnostic. It is easy to say that one wants to change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's body, but implicit in that statement is the assumption that the change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will not change oneself. This is not true; any change of the body is a change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of oneself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't see why avoidance of mere labels adds anything at all of
<br>
value.  If the mind is separable from the body you immediately
<br>
have a form of real dualism.  If we can in fact function as
<br>
intelligent beings in a vastly expanded capacity once thus
<br>
separated from our original bodies (uploaded) then a form of
<br>
what is prejudicially labelled cybergnosticism in fact makes
<br>
sense and is seemingly inevitable.  Value judgements of the
<br>
pre-upload state as being &quot;impure&quot; are of course not necessary
<br>
either.
