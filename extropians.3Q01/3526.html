<p>Hmmm.  It looks like Mismeasure of Man&quot; came out in 1981.  The Bell Curve 
<br>
was 1995.  Was there a later edition by Gould that added to the anti-Bell 
<br>
curve flamage?
<br>
<p>When my reading group decided to read The Bell Curve, I said that I didn't 
<br>
want to read the book, because I feared that Murray would convince me that 
<br>
IQ was (at least partially) innate and (somewhat) related to race.  I was 
<br>
right.
<br>
<p>I've read some of the material attacking Murray and the book, and I didn't 
<br>
find any that attacked his methods or his data.  Mostly sound and fury 
<br>
against his results and against discriminating based on these statistics.  
<br>
If you read Murray, you'll find that he argues for public policies that are 
<br>
aware of the differences between groups, but don't use them as the basis 
<br>
for making distinctions between individuals.
<br>
<p>The main point of the book, of course, is completely unrelated to race.  
<br>
Murray and Herrenstein argued that modern industry is much more sensitive 
<br>
to the difference that smart, competent employees make,  and so the wage 
<br>
differential based on intelligence has increased.  This has the effect of 
<br>
encouraging a much higher percentage of smart people to go where they are 
<br>
most valued.  This means that other groups have fewer wise old hands 
<br>
around.  This is a problem for all of us.
