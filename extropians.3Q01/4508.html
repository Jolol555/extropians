<p>
I know that there are many people on the list that are pro-lifespan
<br>
extension but they don't have the expertise in various fields such
<br>
as biochemistry or molecular biology to make any contribution to
<br>
those areas even though they might like to.
<br>
<p>It occurred to me recently that there is something that all of us
<br>
could do to increase the body of knowledge needed to extend
<br>
lifespan.  What is it?  Well you probably guessed from the subject
<br>
line -- raise zebrafish.
<br>
<p>We are all familiar with Michael Rose's (and others) breeding
<br>
experiments to extend the lifespan of Drosophila.  That work is
<br>
being repeated, I believe, in mice, but the funding for that
<br>
effort is quite iffy IMO.  However, there is nothing
<br>
stopping many of us from going down to a local pet store and
<br>
finding the oldest zebrafish available and beginning our own
<br>
project in breeding zebrafish for extended longevity.
<br>
<p>Why would that be useful?  The more models we have, particularly
<br>
in vertebrates, of the genetic changes needed to extend longevity,
<br>
the more information scientists will have regarding the &quot;patches&quot;
<br>
that need to be applied to the human genome to extend our lifespans.
<br>
<p>The project to sequence the Zebrafish genome has recently been
<br>
started at the Sanger Center in England.  It is scheduled for
<br>
completion around 2003.  It might take us 10 or more years to
<br>
breed long-lived zebrafish but by the time we produce them
<br>
there will be robust tools to analyze the genome changes that
<br>
took place to extend their longevity.  That will in turn help
<br>
scientists understand what genome changes are likely to be required
<br>
for humans.
<br>
<p>Raising and breeding zebrafish need not be very expensive or time
<br>
consuming and you might even find it fun.  Having a number of people
<br>
do it would be useful because we would end up with a number of different
<br>
strains that might have independent genetic changes.
<br>
<p>What say you?
<br>
<p>Robert
