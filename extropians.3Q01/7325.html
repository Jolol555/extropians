Nice thoughts Eric. It is refreshing to look at something we see every day 
<br>
using a different, detached, more analytical point of view.
<br>
<p>One thing I thought of when you mentioned the rail guns firing bullet-like 
<br>
carriage/capsules into sub-orbital trajectories was that slight crosswinds 
<br>
would screw up the aim, but of course you could have some small control 
<br>
surfaces on the vehicles to ensure it manoeuvered into the correct landing 
<br>
point. If there was a hurricane taking place at the destination then the 
<br>
vehicle would not take that route anyway. As you said, the system would 
<br>
communicate info between its parts.
<br>
<p>I wonder if virtual reality might make travel less needed in the future. 
<br>
Perhaps people might travel not because they have to, but because they want 
<br>
to. In that case the speed of travel might not be so important anymore. 
<br>
Maybe people will come to enjoy the travel for its own sake. (Hmmm... maybe 
<br>
not -- most people will probably always want to jump quickly to their 
<br>
destination to maximise their holiday time.)
<br>
<p>VR would enable work to be done from home more. Using telepresence, even 
<br>
factory equipment could be operated, reducing the need for travel even 
<br>
further. That, of course depends on how expensive such equipment remains 
<br>
relative to the cost of human labor.
<br>
<p>All very interesting stuff... and part of the reason why I want *so* much 
<br>
to live to see the long-term future.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Miriam

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
