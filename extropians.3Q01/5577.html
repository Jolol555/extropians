<p><p>The numbers above are inexact.  The word &quot;bosses&quot; is misplaced
<br>
as most worker's boss is a low to mid-level manager.  These
<br>
people certainly do not make 419 times what their employees do. 
<br>
By the imprecise language quoted the statement is much more
<br>
inflammatory than is remotely justified.
<br>
<p>In the high tech world it is not that uncommon for senior
<br>
engineers to make as much or more than their manager or to be so
<br>
close in salary as to make little difference.
<br>

<em>&gt; Joking aside, the problem, as I see it, is that it is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unstable system. It will switch over one day, and it can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that gently or violently or somewhere between those extremes,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This stuff has been claimed since the beginning of the
<br>
industrial revolution and before in feudal states.  But unlike
<br>
in feudal states in a free economy the economy itself will
<br>
adjust compensation levels if the get too out-of-whack.  If I
<br>
can find top executives and deploy them at a tenth of what other
<br>
enterprises can then clearly I will win by doing so.  If
<br>
top-rate executives are actually rare enough and enough in
<br>
demand then their salaries are not out of line with supply and
<br>
demand.  It is no more complex or any more of a tragedy than
<br>
that.  I would also point out that for most start-ups the
<br>
compensation package is largely theoretical beyond a base-salary
<br>
which is certainly not astronomical.  The rest depends on making
<br>
it to IPO with a solid enough company to make the stock
<br>
incentives worth something real.
