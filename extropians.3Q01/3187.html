<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Whites also don't join the military in similar numbers because whites
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; tend to have a higher respect for higher education than blacks and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; better prepared for college than blacks. In the words of black comedian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Chris Rock: &quot;Cut the 'racism' bullshit, and get off your ass.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well that's intellectual rigour, quoting a comedian.
</em><br>
<p>This sarcasm is going to turn out to be symptomatic, I fear.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm not going to argue with you any more Mike, because, I've spent many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years listening to your vitriol and inability to understand the concepts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compassion or fairness, and watched many people I've admired on this list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waste countless hours on you. It's like talking to a brick wall - you never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer questions directly, you misquote, you take out of context, you set up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straw men, you come across as rude, bullying and aggressive, you have never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once been wrong about anything (irony again!).
</em><br>
<p>Mike Lorrey has written 18 posts in the last three days.  I would
<br>
appreciate very much if you would back up your claim.  I want to
<br>
see some examples in those 18 posts of
<br>
<p>* vitriol
<br>
* never [sic] answering questions directly
<br>
* misquoting
<br>
* setting up straw men
<br>
* coming across as rude or bullying
<br>
<p>I am committed to the truth.  If you can find instances of those,
<br>
and they are, as you imply, quite unambiguous, I will join you
<br>
in your assertions.  But if you cannot, then I would expect that
<br>
in the interests of fair play, you would admit that you had spoken
<br>
hastily, and retract your remarks.
<br>
<p>It's very simple.  Just back up your assertions.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee Corbin
