</em><br>
<p>Good point, but the example is odd (I say after the briefest visit to Dr
<br>
Plantinga's homepage). Regard this strange assertion:
<br>
<p>========================
<br>
A letter from Plantinga, a philosophy professor, and Huston Smith, a
<br>
religion professor at Berkeley, moved the National Association of Biology
<br>
Teachers to remove anti-religious language from its statement on evolution.
<br>
<p>For years, the association's official position read: &quot;The diversity of life
<br>
on earth is the outcome of evolution: an unsupervised, impersonal,
<br>
unpredictable and natural process.&quot;
<br>
<p>Recently, after Plantinga and Smith objected that &quot;unsupervised&quot; and
<br>
&quot;impersonal&quot; go beyond scientific  evidence, the association dropped those
<br>
words.
<br>
<p>&quot;I was a little surprised, actually, but I was very pleased,&quot; says
<br>
Plantinga, a member of South Bend Christian Reformed Church who came to
<br>
Notre Dame from Calvin College in Grand Rapids, 15 years ago. &quot;It's a small
<br>
but significant little thing in the whole debate.
<br>
<p>&quot;There is so much heat in this area -- people's faith, people's ideology is
<br>
involved-- that often straightforward, rational discussion doesn't work
<br>
well.&quot; Plantinga and Smith are among a growing number of Christian
<br>
scholars, including scientists, who challenge what they consider the
<br>
unscientific presuppositions of modern culture with respect to evolution. 
<br>
<p>&quot;I think the main thing to see about it is that it is by no means merely a
<br>
scientific doctrine at all,&quot; Plantinga says. &quot;It is about naturalism vs.
<br>
theism, naturalism vs. American religious belief, naturalism vs. Christianity.
<br>
<p>&quot;They think science has shown that human beings are not really created by
<br>
God. That's not true at all. That's not science. That's theology. It's bad
<br>
theology because it's theology confused with science.&quot;
<br>
<p>That's the point he and Smith argued successfully about the biology
<br>
association's position.
<br>
<p>&quot;A good bit of it was theology, not science,&quot; Plantinga says. &quot;There's no
<br>
way, simply on the basis of physical science, that you could have
<br>
discovered that the process is unsupervised or impersonal.
<br>
<p>&quot;That's not part of evolutionary theory as science at all. We wondered why
<br>
it was stated as a piece of science.&quot;
<br>
<p>Unlike those who object to evolutionary theories on religious grounds,
<br>
Plantinga and others do not insist that the Genesis account of creation
<br>
must be taken literally.
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm somebody who thinks God created the world,&quot; Plantinga says. &quot;I'm not
<br>
sure that's what the Lord intends to teach in that part of Genesis. I don't
<br>
know exactly how he did it. It's possible he did it by evolution.&quot;
<br>
<p>==================================
<br>
<p>So the bacteria changing rapidly in human bodies within the span of a few
<br>
decades might be doing so *under the personal supervision of a deity*? Or
<br>
is it under the personal supervision of the devil? Cf. his whimsical
<br>
definition: 
<br>
<p>&lt; alvinize, v. To stimulate protracted discussion by making a bizarre
<br>
claim. &quot;His contention that natural evil is due to Satanic agency alvinized
<br>
his listeners.&quot; &gt;
<br>
<p>I assume Dr Alvin P. does find this a bizarre assertion; I regard his own
<br>
assertion--that we might any longer regard stochastic evolutionary
<br>
processes as under
<br>
the guiding hand of a god--exactly as ridiculous. I'm ashamed that the
<br>
National Association of Biology Teachers caved in.
<br>
<p>But maybe Dr Plantinga has more intelligent things to say elsewhere. Got a
<br>
specific paper you'd recommend, Mark? (Or am I missing a meta-point, and
<br>
you're poking fun at this `luminary'?)
