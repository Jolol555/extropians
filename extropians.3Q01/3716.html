<p>
I have one big advantage in these discussions, at least in terms of tolerance, that goes
<br>
back to a day when I was twelve years old.  I moved to a new junior high school, and one
<br>
day at lunch witnessed this certain kid arguing with four other kids at the same time...,
<br>
and wiping them out!   Next to him, they sounded like children.
<br>
<p>It was 1960, and this boy was for Kennedy, &quot;the lesser of two evils&quot;, as he explained.  I
<br>
started to debate with him, and almost immediately he lost interest in what the other kids
<br>
were saying, and they wandered away.  He was the complete agnostic liberal, and I, the
<br>
complete Christian conservative.  But what I am most proud of was that we each almost
<br>
*instantaneously* perceived that the other was neither stupid, nor ignorant, nor evil.
<br>
Our arguments went on for five years, almost until the very last year of high school.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the very first sentences, our debates never descended to name-calling or real anger.
</em><br>
There was exasperation, &quot;how could you *possibly* believe that?&quot;, and even sarcasm.  But
<br>
the tone was always civil.  One thing that emerged after a few months was that we were
<br>
each being prepped nightly by our fathers, who were committed ideologues.  But we were
<br>
quite proud of the fact that because our fathers each was extremely excitable, emotional,
<br>
and intolerant, we were able to rationally discuss the issues in ways that we knew that
<br>
they would were incapable of.
<br>
<p>We became each other's model of what a pretty-far-left liberal or a pretty-far-right
<br>
conservative should be like.  In later years, I'd notice some inconsistency in what some
<br>
leftists were doing or saying, such as those who demanded amnesty after committing a
<br>
civil-rights type law violation, and say to myself, &quot;What?  Not even Davis would say
<br>
that!&quot;.
<br>
<p>Far from seeing each other as mean-spirited or stupid, instead---because of the obvious
<br>
symmetries of our positions---there arose the amazing platonic vision of the political
<br>
spectrum.  We knew of famous people to the left of him and to the right of me.  There was
<br>
obviously a deep difference in values or visions, but we never lost faith that we could
<br>
eventually get somewhere in our discussions.  Sometimes we did.
<br>
<p>I'm glad our debates finally ended.  I'd probably still be a Christian if they hadn't.
<br>
