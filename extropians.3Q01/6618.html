<p><em>&gt; It's an interesting idea, but bullets are a LOT cheaper than airplanes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no matter how great our manufacturing capabilities are. I don't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how you're going to keep them from being shot down.
</em><br>
<p>Well, these are &quot;moving&quot; targets, so presumably there isn't
<br>
a 1-to-1 bullet-to-kill ratio.  It would be interesting to know
<br>
what the air speed is that planes would have to be to make shooting by
<br>
human snipers highly inneffective.  Which of course would lead to robotic
<br>
anti-aircraft weapons, leading to all kinds of counter measures.
<br>
But it takes time for less technologically sophisticated countries
<br>
to develop and deploy these.
<br>
<p>In my mind it becomes a question of mass-production and efficiency
<br>
scales.  We are talking &quot;model&quot; airplanes with video cameras and
<br>
some communications chips as being the foot soldiers here.  If it
<br>
goes to the MEMS scale, we are talking &quot;flys&quot; on the wall.  At
<br>
some point the bullets *do* become more expensive than what is being
<br>
shot at.
<br>
<p>If you blanket a society in inexpensive surveillance equipment it simply
<br>
becomes pointless at some point to shoot them down.  One ought to be able
<br>
to calculate what the production capacity that would be needed to be such
<br>
that the Afgani population/bin Laden cells would become so preoccupied
<br>
with dealing with the mosquitos that their ability to launch terrorist
<br>
initiatives would be severely compromised.  The interesting thing is
<br>
that we know from internet protocols how to &quot;route around&quot; node
<br>
failures and certainly have the ability to arrange unit failures
<br>
such that they automatically call up replacements.  If our mass
<br>
delivery capability exceeds their mass removal capability, you can
<br>
simply bury the terrorists in the broken wreckage of the surveillance
<br>
units they have killed.
<br>
<p>If we assume that cruise missles cost $1M, and surveillance planes
<br>
could be manufactured for $500, then one gets ~2000 spies per cruise
<br>
missle.  Assuming we would be willing to spend $1B on locating
<br>
bin Laden, then you have ~2 million planes flying over Afganistan.
<br>
That is a *lot* of shooting one would have to do to negate the
<br>
observational capabilities.
