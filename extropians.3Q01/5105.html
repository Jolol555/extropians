<p><em>&gt;Do you have doubts that a Cessna or a lorry will be unable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deliver a 200 kg object? I'm pretty certain you can ship a piece
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of slightly subcritical Pu239 with UPS, and no one would give a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;damn. If it needs be, I'll just use a cartwheel.
</em><br>
<p>Why is it that international drug cartels don't ship their product
<br>
via UPS or FedX then?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why are there no instances of properly done WOMD terrorism, yet?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, you have to be evil, irrational, wealthy and reasonably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;competent, and marginally lucky. Such traits are more or less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;independently distributed, though some of them are correlated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There's a probability of such an event occurring, and with every
</em><br>
<em>&gt;passing year it is getting easier. So, this hasn't happened, yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Will this happen, eventually? It sure seems so.
</em><br>
<p>I tend to agree with you on this. Of course the first successful
<br>
terrorist attack with a weapon of mass destruction will probably be
<br>
it's last since undoubtably the retaliation will mean complete
<br>
elimination of said group.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;But I don't have to burn gigabucks on improbable scenarios, hein?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Would seem rather wasteful, if not entirely pointless.
</em><br>
<p>Since we know the current system is &quot;not ready for primetime&quot; I
<br>
agree that deployment at this time is inadvisable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Biological warfare is considerably more difficult than most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;people  believe.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, given a choice between aerosoling VX in the subway, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dumping MDR anthrax spores into air ducts of said subway, or doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;airburst during a large sports game, or obtaining fissibles and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;building a few kTon nuke I'd probably choose anthrax. VX would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;come a close second, nukes I wouldn't even consider, until someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;helpful would supply me with more or less useful Pu, and even then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I would have a hard time. I would be a lot more comfortable with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vacuuming off anthrax in a suit than trying to make a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;100 kg of VX with heavy protection in the desert somewhere. Have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you ever worn heavy protection for prolonged periods of time? It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not fun.
</em><br>
<p>Getting an airborne form of anthrax is not easy, the Japanese cult
<br>
Aum Shinrikyo despite being technically very sophisticated failed
<br>
in it's attempts. Good luck playing with VX.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Why would a terrorist want to use ICBMs? Tell me why this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likely.
</em><br>
<p>Terrorists no, rogue nations yes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;No, but if you're smart about it you apply your resources so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you get optimal ROI. Star wars rapidly gets ridiculously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expensive. You have to add a zero to the officially published
</em><br>
<em>&gt;numbers, then you're roughly in the ballpark of the real costs.
</em><br>
<p>I would once again argue that we are not talking Star Wars here,
<br>
but a limited number of ABMs.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;You mentioned China, for some strange reason, so I felt compelled
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to point out that such umbrella is useless against a superpower.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You keep harping that terrorists are nice enough to make it easy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for you, which is somehow unconvincing.
</em><br>
<p>I have stated a number of times that the system we were discussing
<br>
was not designed for either superpowers nor terrorists, but rogue
<br>
nations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Okay, tell me a few good arguments as to why you think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;umbrella will work against a sneaky terrorist type of attack which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;won't use ICBMs. Trust me, they won't. They won't advertise it on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prime time TV, either. In fact they won't even tell you afterwards
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who nuked you. They're crazy, but they're not that stupid.
</em><br>
<p>Again the system is not designed to thwart terrorists, except those
<br>
that head a rogue nation. Whether or not we successfully identify
<br>
the terrorists in you theoretical attack would remain to be seen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;18 minutes is a great long time, particularly if the average
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distance to the next shelter is short. Like, really short.
</em><br>
<p>You couldn't even begin to successfully alert a population in 18
<br>
minutes, much less get them to move anywhere unless they were
<br>
completely prepared.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, how many shelters can you build for 300 gigabucks, or so?
</em><br>
<p>Not enough by far.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Useless? Them are few nukes, we agreed, since this is a limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scale attack. You're not carpet bombing the target, and you're not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;laying one after another with some few min pause in between. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you want to get killed, you choose a clear day and stand in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;open exposing maximum amount of skin. The IR flash fries your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;skin, and if the shockwave doesn't finish you off the burns will,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eventually. If you stand behind something as flimsy as a white
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sheet of linen, and after the flash rapidly duck behind a sturdy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wall, the kill radius suddenly shrinks, a lot. If you sit in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simple cellar, the kill radius shrinks a lot farther. If you sit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;10 m underground, in a more or less intelligently designed bunker
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the typical weak terrorist nuke (which will be typically not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ground explosion, as you want to fry as many as possible) could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explode within few 100 m radius, and you should still survive it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;With enough material between you and the nuke, and if it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;couple to the ground the thing could explode on top of you, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you would be still fine.
</em><br>
<p>There you go, your attack by your terrorists, using your scenario
<br>
isn't even worth building a defense against.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, unless you explain the kill mechanism which is supposed to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the people in the bunkers I'm so far unconvinced.
</em><br>
<p>My mistake, when I think of ICBM I think fusion not fission, so we
<br>
don't even need to build bunkers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; underground shelters of the type you describe are far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; expensive and essentially useless.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Subways are expensive, but they're there. Underground parking lots
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are expensive, but they're there. Integrating bunkers into houses
</em><br>
<em>&gt;translates into extra reinforced concrete and more earthworks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's an incremental cost on existing houses. Few hundred gigabucks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can buy a lot of these.
</em><br>
<p>A smart terrorist would place his bomb in the largest shelter he
<br>
could find.
<br>
<p>But this is again besides the point, the system we were discussing
<br>
was to defend against a limited number of rogue state launched
<br>
ICBM's not a terrorist attack. This does not make it useless.
<br>
<p>Since the system in question does not currently function, the rest
<br>
is academic.
