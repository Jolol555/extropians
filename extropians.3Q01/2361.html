<p><em>&gt;I did not think you were a statist, though I did think you were a legal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;positivist -- in my use of the term.  (Perhaps my usage is a
</em><br>
misinterpretation.  I'll have to sleep on that.:)
<br>
<p><p>Well, I'd say I'm in the tradition of Hart and Raz, if that helps. I don't 
<br>
think either of them rules out moral critiques of the law - *I* certainly 
<br>
don't. While their views are highly complex, I think they'd essentially say 
<br>
that bad laws are (1) bad but (2) nonetheless laws. This strikes me as 
<br>
commonsense, but some natural law theorists would say that sufficiently bad 
<br>
laws are not laws at all, even if they have pretty compelling 
<br>
characteristics of legal norms such as appearing in
<br>
the statute books.
<br>
<p>The point I was trying to make was a simple one, that you have to have a 
<br>
*theory* of what makes laws good and bad before condemning particular laws, 
<br>
not just say, for example, that taxation looks awfully like theft in some 
<br>
ways, *therefore* &quot;taxation is theft&quot;. I'm not saying such moral critiques 
<br>
of the law can't be done, or that Jerry was necessarily making such an error 
<br>
as I just described. I just wanted to probe him a bit on what his theory 
<br>
was, including what political or legal philosophy he might have been using. 
<br>
He seems to be relying a lot on Ayn Rand. And he doesn't seem to have minded 
<br>
my gentle probing too much. (Right, Jerry? Jerry??)  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My point on political philosophy was not to belittle you (or anyone),
</em><br>
but just to show that the answers you want might require a wider net than 
<br>
the one you are casting.
<br>
<p><p>Okay. Good to have that cleared up.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>
<p>Russell
