</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not saying there isn't a common factor in the mindset behind the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I've often wondered which is a more effective political technique:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resisting something, with the result being that the resulting
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; push it so that it goes so far in the other direction that it is easily

</em><br>
<p>Looking at the UK, I really think it's better to fight it out than
<br>
to egg the bad law on.
<br>
<p>(NB: my reason for saying it would be _bad_ to link DRM circumvention
<br>
to guns in the UK is that the old syllogism &quot;when guns are outlawed,
<br>
only outlaws will have guns&quot; has sunk in; and if you say, in such
<br>
a situation, that &quot;X is like a gun&quot; you are by implication saying that 
<br>
&quot;only outlaws will have a reason to own X&quot;. At least, that's how the
<br>
message would be received over here: guilt by association would apply,
<br>
because guns are _not_ generally perceived as a civil rights issue. This
<br>
is purely a local argument and shouldn't dissuade you from using this
<br>
tactic in the US if you think it'll work; I just think you ought to
<br>
be careful what horses you couple your wagon to.)
