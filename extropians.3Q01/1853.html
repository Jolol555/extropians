<em>&gt;&gt; Yes, but (as [Damien] said in some text I deleted) it could take a while

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I just have a hard problem suggesting to them that they needn't do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; these things.  I'm pretty sure you feel the same way.  I think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people are simply better off if they follow the &quot;old&quot; maxims.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure.  I have a hard problem with that too.  But who is saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that? Certainly not I or anyone else I have heard here.
</em><br>
<p>With the Singularity so close, why would you tell someone to save
<br>
money, work hard (even when they don't feel like it), and educate
<br>
themselves (even when they don't want to)?  I'll bet that you have
<br>
reasons!  But they can retort &quot;now there is a GMI---so I don't
<br>
*have* to do any of those things, right?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Technically and economically we can feed everyone right now. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The main barriers are all political.  Waiting until after MNT is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bullshit.
</em><br>
<p>You still have not answer my earlier question:  how much money
<br>
do you think that your U.S. government will have to spend on the
<br>
200,000,000 adults in the U.S. to provide the GMI?  Remember also,
<br>
that we have now learned (thanks to Chris Rauch this morning 10:01am)
<br>
that about one-fourth of the populace would quit working within a
<br>
year, and that many more might have less incentive to work if they
<br>
**thought** that a lot of lazy people were getting a free ride?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; People like Bill Gates now have wealth that is on the order
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of 10^7 times as much as some poor person needs to sustain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; life.  Maybe it would be best to wait until that figure gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to 10^12 or 10^13, because then a number of compassionate rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people will simply fund a minimal standard of living for everyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This should occur as we approach the Singularity, and we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the onerous stealing from the rich to give to the poor (by force).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the meantime what?  Starvation?  
</em><br>
<p>Do you have any idea of how many people each year starve
<br>
to death in the U.S.?   Hint: do you think that it reaches
<br>
the newspapers when an elderly person trapped in their
<br>
apartment actually does?  About how many children in the
<br>
U.S. starve to death each year?  Is the GMI really needed
<br>
to prevent starvation?
