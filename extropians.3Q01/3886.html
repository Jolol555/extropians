<p><p><em>&gt;Whether past attempts of setting up colonies had failed have little 
</em><br>
relevance to a
<br>
<em>&gt; new attempt that uses radically different ideas and technology.
</em><br>
<p>I think you may mean that past attempts failing may have little relevance to 
<br>
the question of whether it is possible to set up a new colony.  But the 
<br>
experience and empirical data from previous attempts, both successful and 
<br>
unsuccessful, has a great deal of relevance to the any actual effort to start 
<br>
a new colony or society.  In scientific method, reason is used to evaluate 
<br>
empirical data from the real world, experience with reality gained by 
<br>
experiment.  Reason is not nearly so effective without data to analyze.  That 
<br>
is why the scientific method involves the use of reason (to develop 
<br>
hypotheses) followed by experiment, (to test a hypothesis) followed by more 
<br>
reason (to re-evaluate the hypothesis in light of experimental data) ad 
<br>
infinitum.  Therefore experience and the data provided by history are 
<br>
relevant.  Not as relevant is if the same technology were to be used, but 
<br>
relevant nonetheless.  Particularly with regard to the internal processes of 
<br>
the new society.  Those, after all, deal with people who have not changed 
<br>
much in the past few thousand years.
<br>
<p>Please recall that I have not asserted that starting a new colony or society 
<br>
is impossible, in fact I have pointed out which attempts succeeded and which 
<br>
ones failed and some possible reasons why.  My point in doing so is to bring 
<br>
to the discussion relevant data.  In developing theories about the real world 
<br>
using reason, it is necessary to check those theories against experience to 
<br>
determine whether the theories are valid.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; You and I have discussed these issues a lot without seeming to reach any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mutual conclusions.  The book &quot;Law's Order&quot; by David Friedman which I am 
</em><br>
now
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reading has some new thinking on this very subject.  I have found it very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; interesting.  I think you would too.  At the very least it is likely to 
</em><br>
change the
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; terms of the discussion between us on topics like this one.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I had downloaded the draft version of the book from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.best.com/~ddfr/laws_order/index.shtml">http://www.best.com/~ddfr/laws_order/index.shtml</a> and will read it soon. I 
</em><br>
had read &gt;another book by the same author entitled &quot;Hidden Order: The 
<br>
Economics of &gt;Everyday Life&quot;.
<br>
<p>Good.  Let me know what you think of the new book.  I haven't read Hidden 
<br>
Order yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do like the author's style and the concepts expounded, however, I find 
</em><br>
that the &gt;book relies on an incomplete theory.
<br>
<p>What's incomplete about his theory?  And by the way, if you want a more 
<br>
complete evaluation of the subject, that's where you might find &quot;Human 
<br>
Action&quot; by Ludwig von Mises to fill in a lot of the gaps in what Friedman 
<br>
says.  But being more complete, it's a very long book.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; An incomplete theory does not mean an invalid theory, but a theory that had 
</em><br>
left
<br>
<em>&gt; out some important factors and would thus distort reality. For instance, 
</em><br>
the theory
<br>
<em>&gt; that Earth had a flat topology would suffice for making small local maps, 
</em><br>
but not
<br>
<em>&gt; world maps. For the issue of using our knowledge of economics to design a 
</em><br>
better
<br>
<em>&gt; economical system, looking *only* through the confines of our textbooks only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seek to confine our minds and restrict us from arriving at a better 
</em><br>
solution.
<br>
<p>I hope you don't think of Friedman's writings, especially &quot;Law's Order&quot; as a 
<br>
dusty old textbook of conventional theory accepted by generation after 
<br>
generation.  It was published in the year 2000, and most of the ideas in it 
<br>
have never been published before.  I'm all for new thinking, even newer than 
<br>
last year's books.  I guess one of the reasons you might feel that I'm 
<br>
talking about &quot;restrictions&quot; is that I keep pointing out that new colonies 
<br>
I've studied which did not have private property and free market principles 
<br>
coincidentally all suffered more than 50% fatality rate in the first year as 
<br>
a direct result of economic problems.  You may find the implication that 
<br>
private property and free markets are essential to be confining or 
<br>
restricting, but it seems to me that they are a liberating tool which makes 
<br>
possible things (such as distant new colonies) which would otherwise be much 
<br>
more dangerous or difficult if not impossible.  Maybe you can find a better 
<br>
tool.  Good luck.  But you might find it less confining to look at the vast 
<br>
amount of things which can be done with these tools instead of trying for 
<br>
radical improvements in those particular economic tools.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actual economies, especially with governments intervening, do not always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correspond to the concepts based in the textbooks.
</em><br>
<p>If you can find a textbook with things like Friedman writes in it, let me 
<br>
know.  Every single textbook on economics I've ever read has drastically 
<br>
different (and in my opinion mostly wrong) economic ideas in it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Highly volatile stock markets wreak havoc with the theory of market 
</em><br>
equilibriums,
<br>
<p>What theory of market equilibriums?  Are you refering to the idea that at a 
<br>
given level of supply and demand that prices seek an equilibrium between the 
<br>
two?  Highly volatile stock markets are completely consistent with that 
<br>
theory.  In fact, that theory helps explain why markets are sometimes 
<br>
volatile.  It's simple.  If there is an equilibrium price at a particular 
<br>
level of supply and a particular level of demand, then what will happen if 
<br>
the amount of supply changes?  There will then be a different equilibrium 
<br>
price.  The market price will then move.  If the demand level changes what 
<br>
happens?  The price moves toward the new equilibrium.  The fact is that 
<br>
supply and demand of the stocks of actively traded companies change rapidly.  
<br>
Therefore prices change radically.  You can use the Yahoo.com finance section 
<br>
to get stock quotes and if you look you will find stocks which don't have 
<br>
much trading activity.  The supply and demand of the stock sometimes remains 
<br>
unchanged for the entire day.  In such cases the price usually also remains 
<br>
unchanged for the entire day.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; people behave in irrational manners such as by their purchasing of lottery 
</em><br>
tickets,
<br>
<em>&gt; our societies do not have free flow of information implicit in many 
</em><br>
economical
<br>
<em>&gt; theories, and people have an irritating tendency not to choose the best 
</em><br>
alternative
<br>
<em>&gt; but the best perceived one.
</em><br>
<p>People cannot do otherwise.  As you know, people can only base their 
<br>
decisions on the information they have.  They choose the alternative they 
<br>
perceive as best because they cannot base their decision on things they do 
<br>
not perceive.  There are economic theories dealing with situations (such as 
<br>
are common in the real world) where decisionmakers do not have all the 
<br>
necessary information.
<br>
<p>You might want to consider the role that prices and markets serve in 
<br>
processing information.  The price of something conveys in one number 
<br>
critical information about all the costs which went into the production of 
<br>
that thing.  The market price simultaneously signals producers how much to 
<br>
produce (based on whether it is higher or lower than their production costs) 
<br>
and it signals users on whether to increase or decrease use of such a product 
<br>
(depending on how expensive it is).  Profit margins signal entrepreneurs 
<br>
which industries to get into or out of.  Investment yields signal investors 
<br>
where to allocate capital.  Investment decisions signal businesses whether to 
<br>
invest in new production facilities or cut back and economize.  All these 
<br>
signals are based upon numbers which are produced by markets.  Those numbers 
<br>
and the vast number of market participants having the independent 
<br>
decisionmaking authority to react to them based upon their own desires, 
<br>
knowledge and abilities, is a method for processing economic information.  
<br>
Could it be done better by computer?  Much of it is done by computer.  The 
<br>
parts which are done by people are the parts which mostly cannot be done by 
<br>
computers of the current technology level.  Or in some cases it is not cost 
<br>
effective to computerize some functions even though it may be possible.
<br>
<p>You can criticize as unrealistic economists who set up economic models which 
<br>
assume everyone has perfect information.  But actual free markets (not 
<br>
economists) process economic information more effectively than any other 
<br>
method ever devised and they can do that only when there is private property 
<br>
and economic freedoms.  It is a self-organizing, decentralized system for 
<br>
accomplishing this.
<br>
<p>Is there a better way for the economy to operate?  Yes.  This is perhaps the 
<br>
most important thing about free markets.  They contain methods for automatic 
<br>
self-improvement.  Of course, government interventions are not so easy for 
<br>
the market to correct, but other factors involving poor education, bad 
<br>
engineering, management blunders, irrational acts, excessively high prices or 
<br>
obsolete technology and many other things are constantly being improved and 
<br>
corrected by market forces which provide incentives for such things to be 
<br>
corrected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;While the complexities involved here have such great magnitudes that certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people believe that we can never design an economy (and sometimes citing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution and chaos theory), however, if we confine ourselves to discussing 
</em><br>
how to
<br>
<em>&gt; create and design a rational society, then we may actually succeed.
</em><br>
<p>Is a free market and private property inconsistent with a rational society?  
<br>
Ludwig von  Mises builds a case in &quot;Human Action&quot; that these are consistent 
<br>
with a rational society and that elimination or infringement of private 
<br>
property and the end to the free market are not consistent with a society of 
<br>
rational people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not all people can and will join, but this has no relevance because we 
</em><br>
logically
<br>
<em>&gt; cannot find ourselves worst off by *voluntarily* experimenting with a new 
</em><br>
concept in
<br>
<em>&gt; isolation since we can always fall back to the old system easily.
</em><br>
<p>Go for it.  Just don't set it up too far from other settlements.  That was 
<br>
one of the mistakes some of the other colonies found.  Many made mistakes.  
<br>
The ones who died from them were the ones which were too far away from other 
<br>
settlements, old or new, to get help when things went wrong.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Keep in mind that government officials, police, judges, jailers, 
</em><br>
prosecutors and
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; legislators and even the people who design societies are also just as 
</em><br>
liable to
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; behave maliciously in order to benefit themselves.  The tool with which 
</em><br>
you seek &gt;&gt; to solve the problem has the same problem. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I disagree. The economical system of the proposed project would have an 
</em><br>
entirely
<br>
<em>&gt; different structure.
</em><br>
<p>Okay.  You were the one who spoke of people &quot;behaving maliciously in order to 
<br>
benefit themselves.&quot;  My point is that you cannot rely upon any group of 
<br>
people not to behave in their own self-interest.  Perhaps they will even do 
<br>
so in ways you consider to be malicious.  Even so-called altruism is 
<br>
motivated in all cases I've ever heard of by self-interest of some kind.  
<br>
Whether or not you have police or legislators it is important to take into 
<br>
account this feature of human behavior.  Even those who design societies tend 
<br>
to be motivated by self-interest and it affects the design of the society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of the many classes of economical systems, our current &quot;capitalist&quot; system 
</em><br>
has
<br>
<em>&gt; an orientation towards rewarding those who achieved the most.
</em><br>
<p>Is there a better alternative?  Should we reward those who achieve less?  
<br>
Those who achieve not at all?  Those whose actions are positively destructive 
<br>
of the achievements of others?  Rewarding achievement inspires more 
<br>
achievement.  Doing anything else is, among other things, inefficient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I hypothesize that the result of this orientation causes people to develop 
</em><br>
their
<br>
<em>&gt; greedy nature, even if originally nature predisposed these people in such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner. Greed (and its opposite, fear), as shown in game theory, clearly 
</em><br>
depletes
<br>
<em>&gt; the common good for the individual good.
</em><br>
<p>Greed and fear are not opposites.  In game theory they often motivate 
<br>
opposite actions, but greed and fear themselves are not opposites.  Greed, is 
<br>
generally defined as an unreasonable acquisitiveness.  This consists of two 
<br>
factors, unreasonableness, whose opposite is reasonableness, and 
<br>
acquisitiveness, whose opposite would be lack of acquisitiveness.  The 
<br>
opposite of fear is a feeling of security.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I hypothesise that *rational* people would prefer solutions that maximise the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common good because we usually don't play one-off zero-sum games in real 
</em><br>
life
<br>
<em>&gt; and we can gain immense benefits over the long run from such behavior.
</em><br>
<p>Why would rational peole prefer maximizing the common good?  If they are 
<br>
motivated by rational self-interest, and sane people are, then they would of 
<br>
course prefer to maximize the common good since some portion of it inures to 
<br>
them personally.  That is, assuming that there was no cost or inconvenience 
<br>
to them to maximize the common good.  If there is, then you will find people 
<br>
behaving in a manner to maximize the common good to the extent that their 
<br>
personal cost from such action is less than their personal gain from it 
<br>
(along with the gain of everyone else who benefits).
<br>
<p>On the other hand, would a rational person prefer to maximize the common good 
<br>
even if his share of that common good is less than the cost to him of such 
<br>
maximization?  Some people will say so, but that is because they derive a 
<br>
benefit from saying so.  You'll think better of people who say so, won't you? 
<br>
&nbsp;They know that, so they say so.  Their actions tend to differ from such 
<br>
statements although actions will sometimes be made which seem to be 
<br>
sacrifices for the common good if the benefits of being a &quot;good guy&quot; willing 
<br>
to make such sacrifices adds sufficient additional benefit.
<br>
<p>Perhaps that doesn't make the case well.  Take the principle beyond a small 
<br>
cost or inconvenience.  If it is a matter of life or death will people prefer 
<br>
to maximize the common good?  Sure.  Especially if they can increase the 
<br>
chances that the group which they are a part of will survive.  Will they 
<br>
volunteer to die so that the group will benefit?  Not usually unless they are 
<br>
either going to die either way, or unless the group which will be saved 
<br>
includes close relatives, especially the volunteer's own children.  This too, 
<br>
is self-interest, only it is behavior perhaps genetically motivated by genes 
<br>
in the self-interest of the genes.  &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; by Dawkins has some 
<br>
interesting things to say on that subject.
<br>
<p>But anyway, assume that no one in the group is a relative.  Would a rational 
<br>
person volunteer to die so that the group would benefit?  Why?  How is that 
<br>
rational?  It is certainly not rational self-interest.  Is self-interest 
<br>
rational?  For the self, yes.  For a group?  Well, if a group were capable of 
<br>
rational thought in any other manner than as individuals, maybe the 
<br>
group-mind would (in its own self-interest) favor the interest of the group 
<br>
(itself) rather than any individual.  But as long as individuals are the 
<br>
entities who engage in rational thought, self-interest is rational.  If a 
<br>
group (via mindlinking technology or some such thing) thinks for itself, its 
<br>
self-interest becomes rational for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To do this (or maximise it to above the chatic threshold), a few conditions 
</em><br>
must &gt;exist:
<br>
<em>&gt; 1) Perfect flow of information (with computer networks). From openness, 
</em><br>
comes &gt;trust.
<br>
<p>Computer networks do not result in perfect flow of information for purposes 
<br>
of economics.  For example, the personal preferences of every single person 
<br>
on Earth with regard to what they would like to have for their next meal and 
<br>
their order of preference of all the possible things they could eat and their 
<br>
preferences adjusted for price, convenience, location, ambiance, who else 
<br>
they might share the meal with, whether the food is hot or cold, etc.  Most 
<br>
people don't, for example, consider their relative preference for all the 
<br>
possible foods and all the possible companions they could have for a meal.  
<br>
But to have *perfect* information, *all* of this would have to be included.  
<br>
How could you, in a lifetime, ever rank even your own preferences for every 
<br>
human being on Earth as luncheon companions.  Or even your own preference for 
<br>
every possible food, cooked every possile way.  Yet these preferences change 
<br>
constantly for everyone on Earth.
<br>
<p>Maybe we can imagine that someday we'll have the bandwidth to transmit such a 
<br>
vast amount of data, but I doubt it is possible to *gather* the data in the 
<br>
first place.
<br>
<p>I propose the hypothesis that it is impossible to gather all economically 
<br>
relevant information.  It might not be possible to analyze it perfectly if it 
<br>
could be gathered, but that is irrelevant if my hypothesis is correct since 
<br>
it cannot be gathered.
<br>
<p>If the hypothesis is correct, all economic decisions must be made with 
<br>
imperfect information.  Of course, that is the way all economic decisions are 
<br>
in fact made.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) Empowered people (by virtue of skills, abilities, knowledge, wisdom 
</em><br>
etc.) must &gt;exist.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Thus, I infer that, in a society of rational people with this conditions, 
</em><br>
then these
<br>
<em>&gt; people will have prefer to contribute to the common good rather than hoard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources to maximise their own utility.
</em><br>
<p>Is it rational to hoard resources?  Wouldn't it be more rational to sell them 
<br>
if you have a surplus?  Isn't that in fact what people usually do?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This has one following condition: That the economical system must 
</em><br>
*compensate*
<br>
<em>&gt; these people, not reward or punish them, so that the amount of resources 
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; acquire and expend would eventually balance to zero.
</em><br>
<p>If you include all transfers of property, including those at death, you will 
<br>
find that that is true.  On the other hand, if at any point where a person is 
<br>
still alive he finds himself with absolutely zero resources, further survival 
<br>
may be difficult.  It is also not easy to predict exactly how many and what 
<br>
kind of resources will be needed.  This is why most rational people prefer to 
<br>
have some money saved up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These people would also most rationally do something they like to do to 
</em><br>
instead of
<br>
<em>&gt; having to take a job they dislike and work on their &quot;hobbies&quot; after work 
</em><br>
hours.
<br>
<p>All rational people prefer to work on something they like to do.  The only 
<br>
reason people work is when the rewards from working are preferable to not 
<br>
working.  Why is it that anyone works, ever?  Some are forced to do it, 
<br>
convicts, military personnel, children given tasks by their parents.  But 
<br>
what about all the others.  Why do they work?  Is it possible for them to 
<br>
live the way they want to without working on things they don't like?  I think 
<br>
it is clear that they haven't figured out a way to do it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The open source movement may support this hypothesis, for in spite of an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economical system that does not reward those who contribute to the common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good, some people do have the initiative to do so.
</em><br>
<p>A free market economic system (which is not the same thing as the current 
<br>
system in your country or mine) does not preclude reward of those who 
<br>
contribute to the common good.  It is important to keep in mind that it is 
<br>
not obvious to anyone exactly what does contribute to the common good, what 
<br>
contributes enough to be worth the effort, and what activity contributing to 
<br>
the common good is optimal as opposed to inefficient.  It is further not easy 
<br>
to determine whether time and resources spent on some particular activity to 
<br>
benefit everyone would not produce more overall benefit than using the same 
<br>
time and resources on some activity which may be more productive but benefits 
<br>
only the people in one city, or one family, or even just one person.  Who 
<br>
decides?  Unless there is plenty of &quot;reward&quot; for every activity to be 
<br>
rewarded regardless of its efficiency, then who decides which activities are 
<br>
rewarded and which more than others?
<br>
<p>If by reward you refer to material goods, those kinds of &quot;rewards&quot; serve to 
<br>
motivate (via self-interest) people to do more of whatever will obtain them.  
<br>
Only if such goods go to those who produce them is there full incentive to 
<br>
produce them.  Without such incentive, many or all of the goods in question 
<br>
will not exist.  They will not be produced.
<br>
<p>There are people who work to invent things which can benefit everyone, or to 
<br>
produce things which everyone has an opportunity to buy if they can give 
<br>
equal value in exchange.  They do get rewarded.  But if a new medicine helps 
<br>
only certain people (who have a hereditary disease) rather than everyone, it 
<br>
is not the &quot;common good&quot; that is helped, but only the good of the people who 
<br>
need it.  Yet that deserves reward too, doesn't it?  Helping just one person 
<br>
is good, isn't it?  Shouldn't that be rewarded?  If you see the point here, 
<br>
you will see that helping *only* the common good is not an optimal use of 
<br>
resources even if there were no other considerations.  And if you want a 
<br>
system which rewards people who help anyone, even one at a time, rather than 
<br>
all at once, you will find that a free market system does that.  Not only 
<br>
does it do it, it does it better than any other system and it has a few other 
<br>
features thrown in (such as requiring payment from the beneficiary of help) 
<br>
which motivate people to ask for only as much help as they need and to make 
<br>
sure that such help is rationed among those most able to help others in 
<br>
return.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You also imply that the person who designs societies may have more power in 
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt;society,
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily more power.  His design may be completely ignored and he may 
<br>
have no power at all.  But if we look at the design, we will almost certainly 
<br>
find that in creating it he was motivated by self-interest and that the 
<br>
motivation affected the design.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but this may not always apply (refer to Intellicracy) and even then, we may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not have a person but the entire society designing itself (as I intend).
</em><br>
<p>Good.  Because they all will try to do so to some extent whether you want 
<br>
them to or not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then, the founders would merely need to establish a set of &quot;seed&quot; 
</em><br>
principles that
<br>
<em>&gt; will allow such development and avoid any problems like power domination by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having &quot;checks and balances&quot; (such as by full disclosure of all information 
</em><br>
and &gt;limiting of society membership).
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that everyone else will have their own ideas about what are the 
<br>
right &quot;seed&quot; principles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Meanwhile, the implication that societies will always have a dedicated 
</em><br>
police,
<br>
<em>&gt; judiciary and other components may or may not apply to an actual society of 
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; different design to those existing today.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I must also debunk the incomplete theory that evolution would always 
</em><br>
produce the
<br>
<em>&gt; best solutions.
</em><br>
<p>Can you define an &quot;incomplete&quot; theory?  Theories are generally evaluated as 
<br>
being useful or not useful, valid or invalid or perhaps also untested.  They 
<br>
are sometimes referred to as right or wrong in more common terminology.  But 
<br>
incomplete?  How are we to evaluate a theory that is &quot;incomplete?&quot;  If 
<br>
Einstein wrote that E=MC and left off the final notation, it would be 
<br>
incomplete in the sense that an additional notation would make it correct.  
<br>
But more importantly, it would be wrong.
<br>
<p>So let us consider this theory that evolution always produces the best 
<br>
solutions.  I think it is wrong.  Not incomplete, wrong.  Biological 
<br>
evolution in nature involves much random chance.  There is no reason to 
<br>
consider it infallible.  It tends towards improvements.  That's not at all 
<br>
the same thing as saying it &quot;always&quot; produces the &quot;best&quot;.  I'm not sure who 
<br>
stated this theory, but as it has been written here it is clearly invalid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We can see that the design of our eyes, with its blind spot, had to do with 
</em><br>
a less
<br>
<em>&gt; than optimal design by nature. We can also see that the QWERTY computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keyboard we use now, that had resulted from &quot;free&quot; competition, actually 
</em><br>
*slows*
<br>
<em>&gt; down our typing speed.
</em><br>
<p>The evolution of ideas and technology also does not always produce the best 
<br>
solution from the point of view of engineering.  It may produce the best 
<br>
result when we include economic factors and the inability of various people 
<br>
to come up with different ideas at different times as well as the costs of 
<br>
fixing mistakes or making improvements to things which had already been built 
<br>
or even typists who had already been trained in a certain way.  Or maybe it 
<br>
does not produce the best effect even if we do consider economic factors.
<br>
<p>I don't see why you use the QWERTY keyboard as an argument against &quot;free&quot; 
<br>
competition or why you put &quot;free&quot; in quotes.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes, we need intelligent design to get from a good solution to an 
</em><br>
excellent
<br>
<em>&gt; one.
</em><br>
<p>Is this an argument between &quot;evolved&quot; solutions rather than designed ones?  
<br>
If so, it is a poor example.  The QWERTY keyboard was designed, not evolved.  
<br>
It was deliberately designed to cause the typist to type slower.  This was in 
<br>
order to solve a problem with early typewriters.  If there was not enough 
<br>
time delay between striking each key, the typewriter would jam.  I've used 
<br>
typewriters like that so I know it's no myth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The status quo knowledge may sound nice and comforting, but if one wishes to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transcend it to find a better solution, then one must look for new 
</em><br>
alternative 
<br>
<em>&gt;solutions.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
One must also convince people to pay any costs associated with a new 
<br>
solution.  If you can convince people who have already learned to type on a 
<br>
QWERTY keyboard that the extra speed is worth buying a new keyboard and 
<br>
learning how to type on it, (and not being able to type quickly on QWERTY 
<br>
keyboards anymore) you could get people to make the change now.  There are 
<br>
reasons the very highest technology is not used to solve every problem.  One 
<br>
of those reasons is cost.  Not just monetary cost, but cost in time, money, 
<br>
resources, inconvenience, etc.
