</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think that envy will always arise towards those considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more capable than oneself under economic and sociological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; systems based primarily upon scarcity models.  In such systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the premise is that there is not enough to go around so the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; able or in some sense best should get the most first, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; leaving too little for oneself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scarcity is a sufficient condition for envy, but, I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardly necessary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As we come into increasing abundance the basis for envy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should decrease if and only if our social, economic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even psychological systems adjust accordingly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you mean eventually providing people with the means to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-engineer themselves to suppress the kinds of envy that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're not fond of, only then do I agree.  But otherwise,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know what you mean by such an &quot;adjustment&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>What I mean is that many of the base level assumptions
<br>
that are formative to these institutions are highly in flux
<br>
as we approach Singularity and we need to make adjustments
<br>
accordingly if those institutions and aspects of ourselves are
<br>
remotedly going to be grounded in what is or helpful to us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, I suspect that you are here projecting your own healthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motives and psychological disposition.  Do you know that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huge number of people are so motivated by envy that it wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter how rich they were so long as someone else was vastly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; richer---and even more annoying---famous?  You should try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking to some of them some time; their hatred of the rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and powerful far exceeds any concerns they have for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor, and far exceeds any actual deprivement anyone has.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>But what did this psychological state grow out of and how
<br>
can it best be overcome in time?  Keeping the system as it
<br>
is far beyond the point where that makes any sense is not
<br>
likely to be helpful at all.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; If we truly want to reduce envy and simultaneously get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more of the people behind full progress then we need imho
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to find ways of sharing the increased wealth that are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For sure; ever since Engines of Creation, at least, only a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few die-hard followers of the old model have been upset by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the idea of free food, clothing, and shelter for everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once it becomes cheap enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>YAY!
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I do not believe that the market economy by itself is doing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sufficiently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you mean to imply that some re-distributive scheme could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been better applied in recent decades?  If not, you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly making it sound that way.  It definitely sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as though you have a better idea, at least for the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I mean that I am gradually coming to believe that something like
<br>
a guaranted income is logical and necessary. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; At the bottom end it is far too easy to fall into economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; destitution in the US today.  There are too many people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; working two or more jobs under poor conditions just to manage to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; survive at all for me to believe that the market alone leads to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the good life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd agree that &quot;the good life&quot; cannot flow from just the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market.  But I dispute that in the United States one even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs to work at all in order to survive.  Provided that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are willing to be institutionalized, or live in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; streets, one hardly *needs* to do anything at all.  (Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course, few people would have the psychological stamina
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to go all the way, and refuse all the inducements to at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least help out, or work a little---but thousands of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each year manage to do it.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In my late teens I was &quot;on the streets&quot;.  It was a different and
<br>
in many ways gentler time than this one.  It was very difficult
<br>
even with basic sanity and full determination and a good mind to
<br>
get off the street.  More so than I would have thought without
<br>
that experience.  Being institutionalized is hell and obviously
<br>
neither that or being homeless is any sort of solution or at all
<br>
conducive to the happiness and well-being of self and others. 
<br>
Nor
<br>
is the fact that one can sort of survive there any indication of
<br>
fundamental health of a society.  So I see little point in
<br>
including
<br>
this here.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Too many people that do have better lives are have more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; debt than savings and are only a few paychecks from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bankruptcy and perhaps homelessness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In every case, this is due to a lack of education---specifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the memes of thrift, prudence, and determination.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>BULLSHIT.  It is also due to a culture that has bought hook,
<br>
line and sinker that mass-consumerism is the only thing that
<br>
keeps us all from poverty and guarantees economic &quot;health&quot;.   
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Upstream their are too many of even the technologically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; elite who have no life but their work, not only or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; principally because of their love of the work, but due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the shape of the economy and the conditions of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unemployment within it.  Something is out of kilter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps their psychology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No.  It is not that simple.  Have you worked in software?  I've
<br>
seen the pace accelerate and re-accelerate not out of any joy in
<br>
creation or creative zeal but out of fear of falling behind, of
<br>
not delivering something/anything before the competitors did, of
<br>
scrabbling for something anything to sell rather than often
<br>
making any real dent in the real needs of the industry.  Every
<br>
year I have watched it get a bit worse and more pervasive.  
<br>
<p>Some of us even put in way more hours because it is our only
<br>
hope of &quot;getting ahead&quot; enough to squeeze in what we believe
<br>
really should be done.  
<br>
<p>This is much deeper than simply personal psychology.
