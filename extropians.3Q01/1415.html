<p>This is a very ambitious study, combining a climate model with an economic
<br>
model.  I can't help being skeptical about whether the researchers have
<br>
bitten off more than they can chew.
<br>
<p>Climate modelling itself is a highly active field with many different
<br>
models in use.  Nordhaus is an economist, not a physicist.  His &quot;three
<br>
box&quot; model (atmosphere, biosphere, ocean) is much simpler than the full
<br>
models being run.  He says that he gets about the same results, but if
<br>
so then that would suggest that the more complex models aren't really
<br>
necessary, wouldn't it?  That doesn't sound right.
<br>
<p>His economic model seems even more questionable.  From page 2-5:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is composed of several regions.  Some regions consist of a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;single sovereign country (such as the U.S.) while other regions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(like OECD Europe or the Low Income Region) contain many countries.
<br>
<p>Skipping to page 2-6:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each region is assumed to produce a single commodity which can be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used for either consumption or investment.  In the model, all changes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in welfare, including those due to climate change, are included in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our definition of consumption of this single commodity.  Thus, we will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sometimes refer to consumption of this all-inclusive commodity as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;generalized consumption&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no international trade in goods or capital except in exchange
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for carbon emissions permits.  That is, we allow regions to trade only
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the sake of paying other regions to lower their emissions or to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receive payment for lowering emissions.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each region is endowed with an initial stock of capital and labor and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an initial and region-specific level of technology.  Population growth
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and technological change are exogenous...
<br>
<p>(&quot;Exogenous&quot; means that these factors are built explicitly into the
<br>
model and aren't affected by the changes within it.)
<br>
<p>The authors comment about the fact that there aren't really any models
<br>
around that attempt to show economic growth through the course of the
<br>
21st century.  Hence they had to create one.  But how much credibility
<br>
does a model have which assumes only one commodity, no significant
<br>
international trade, and that technology and population growth are
<br>
independent of economic activity?
<br>
<p>Page 2-17 describes their model of technological growth.  Aj(t) is the
<br>
technology factor, also called &quot;total factor productivity&quot;:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major uncertainty in the model involves projecting the growth of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aj(t), or total factor productivity (TFP), into the future.  TFP
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;growth is assumed to slow gradually over the next three centuries
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until eventually stopping.
<br>
<p>You read it right.  Technology growth is assumed to slow and then stop.
<br>
This is a highly questionable assumption which of course would represent
<br>
a complete reversal of historical trends.  I stopped reading after
<br>
that point.
<br>
<p>For those interested in pursuing it, his model is available for
<br>
download as an Excel spreadsheet.  It would be interesting to plug in
<br>
some more aggressive growth scenarios and see if it alters his results
<br>
qualitatively.
