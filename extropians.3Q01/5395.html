<em>&gt; The thing that worries me is that if government is reduced to the point
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Who is 'they'? If you mean the government, powerful business interests
<br>
are not able to use the government to any extent because that government
<br>
is limited in what it can do. In such a situation, a union, for example,
<br>
would always overpower a corporation because the union membership will
<br>
always outnumber the corporation's lackeys, where both sides can arm or
<br>
disarm as much as they wish. The government would not be empowered to
<br>
step in on the corporations side to force the union to settle, or impede
<br>
the union membership from arming as they see fit.
<br>
<p>Liberals always see themselves, as individuals, as being entirely
<br>
powerless in all possible situations, reliant on the government patron
<br>
to protect them. This is part of the liberal victimological myth that
<br>
has evolved from common serf attitudes held by immigrants coming from
<br>
feudal and tyrannical systems. They don't see that if the power of the
<br>
government is reduced, not only is the ability of the corporations
<br>
reduced (since their power is given to them by government protections),
<br>
but the individuals regain great power as individuals, because that is
<br>
where the government got its power in the first place.
<br>
<p>Under libertarianism, laborers will gain far greater power than they
<br>
realize, and corporations will finally be fully exposed to the
<br>
retribution they earn by unjust actions.
