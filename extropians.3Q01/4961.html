Brian Phillips said to Miriam
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yeesh. I think your comment dragged down the average level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of discourse on the list a few percentage points.  I don't spend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;valuable time reading Extropian for the liberal schmaltz after all.
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, what do you read it for? I think that Miriam's &quot;liberal schmaltz: is
<br>
just as legitimate as all the other political discussion that goes on here.
<br>
<p>Speaking for myself, I read the list in the hope of obtaining clues and
<br>
making contacts in one of my personal projects, which consists of contesting
<br>
neo-Luddite ideas, developing an intellectual defence of transhumanism, and
<br>
arguing in public for the transhumanist cause. Most of what I read is just
<br>
noise from that viewpoint. However, it's pleasant chatting about all kinds
<br>
of things with a group of people who are broadly sympathetic to the above
<br>
aims. I don't expect them all to agree with my political views and I don't
<br>
get angry or impatient when I encounter disagreement. Indeed, there are
<br>
people on this list with very different political views from mine whom I'd
<br>
now like to think of as friends. Eg, take a bow, Lee and Reason.
<br>
<p>But I *am* getting impatient with the use of the word &quot;liberal&quot; (in the
<br>
sense of social democrat/ic) as one of abuse. The way this is done, day in
<br>
day out, suggests that some people here believe that liberal ideas in that
<br>
sense are somehow contrary to extropianism or to transhumanism or to the
<br>
list's traditions and are illegitimate on this list.
<br>
<p>*Is* that the feeling? Are any of you prepared to come right out and say
<br>
that people with Olga's political views, or Miriam's, or Damien's, or even
<br>
mine, are just not welcome here? Should we simply form our own transhumanist
<br>
list and avoid a lot of grief?
<br>
<p>Grumpily
<br>
<p>Russell
