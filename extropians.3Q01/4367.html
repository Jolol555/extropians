<br>
<em>&gt; I don't think DNA can be copyrighted, so this particular way to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oneself from being cloned probably wouldn't work. The story also mentions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that US courts have ruled against turning someone into a parent without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his or her consent
</em><br>
<p>Correction, US courts have ruled against turning someone into a parent without
<br>
her consent, but in the case of his consent, US courts have not ruled against
<br>
it, and men have indeed been turned into parents without their consent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; so copyright protection isn't really necessary. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this wouldn't prevent large-scale cloning of celebrities, since you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can create one illegal clone, get his consent, and then all subsequent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clones will be legal.
</em><br>
<p>Not according to US law, where otherwise lawful acts, dependent upon unlawful
<br>
acts, thereby become unlawful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (It does cause an 18-year delay though, or however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many years until the illegal clone reaches age of consent.)
</em><br>
<p>By that time the evolutionary phase transition will have rendered organic
<br>
carbon units obsolete, and biology will have transcended organic chemistry. As
<br>
a consequence, cloning will have become a moot issue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wonder if we might see anti-cloning technology that actually would work.
</em><br>
<p>Such technology already exists. It's called abortion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example a genetically engineered self-destruct mechanism that causes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a cell's DNA to be wiped as soon as it is detached from the body. How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feasible would this be?
</em><br>
<p>This would involve some type of sub-micro or nano sensing device which could
<br>
detect the cells' detachment from other cells. Living cells do respond to the
<br>
cells around them, which indicates some kind of mechanism for detecting (if
<br>
not actually sensing) the integrity of multicellular structure already
<br>
operates in biological systems. A retro-virus (or possibly a prion targeting
<br>
nucleic acid) which is activated upon detachment from surrounding cells, and
<br>
which is included in each and every cell of the body, could accomplish the DNA
<br>
destruction that you imagine. This technology might have the negative
<br>
epiphenomenon of making the subject unable to undergo organ transplant
<br>
surgery.
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, and ego.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
