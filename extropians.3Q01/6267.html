Subject: OWL: On Today's Events
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;From what I've heard so far, Mary McAleese, the Irish President, said it
</em><br>
best: &quot;It's not just a crime against the American people, it's not just a
<br>
crime against the American civilization. It's a crime against the very
<br>
foundations of all our humanity.&quot;
<br>
<p>As a New Yorker, I've always seen the architecture of New York City as the
<br>
physical manifestation of man's will; it is the intellectual achievement of
<br>
man captured in stone and steel. To attack these monuments and individuals
<br>
in
<br>
them is to declare we are nothing more than irrational, violent animals.
<br>
<p>The towers of the World Trade Center were pillars of civilization.
<br>
<p>For those of us who actually saw the towers fall live, it was a moment of
<br>
horror we will never forget. It was not simply the devastation to a city, or
<br>
the loss of lives, but an immediately obvious attack on our principals and
<br>
way of life. It shook not only the foundation of our city, but the
<br>
foundation
<br>
of our existence.
<br>
<p>Such events inspire incredible rage and bloodlust in even the most rational
<br>
of us. But it is in moments of crisis that we are truly tested. We should
<br>
act swiftly and forcefully but rationally; we must find the *individuals*
<br>
responsible for these acts and hold them accountable.
<br>
<p>It is imperative that we deal with this matter rationally, otherwise we will
<br>
be reduced to the level of the animals who attacked us. We must set an
<br>
example not only of justice, but how it is attained. This means through
<br>
rational, precise behavior, not blind violence.
<br>
<p>Also, we must not turn our anger inward and blame our own government for
<br>
these events. The events will speak for themselves. Our lives have been
<br>
permanently changed and our government will change to reflect this either by
<br>
its choice or ours. This is a democracy.
<br>
<p>I hope these events bring the rational among us closer together, and make us
<br>
stronger. Let the anger we feel strengthen our resolve, and help us
<br>
persevere. This perhaps more than any other event in history illustrates the
<br>
need for a rational, objective society.
<br>
<p>I am proud to be an American. No act of cowardly violence upon us will take
<br>
that from me.
