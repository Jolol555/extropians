<em>&gt; A rationalist cannot debunk religion with the scientific method any more

</em><br>
<p>But the religionists have placed themselves in the court of science when
<br>
they claim that their faith-based healings actually have medical
<br>
effectiveness. This faith-based healing is the claim of every tv preacher
<br>
I know of. Recently a leader of the &quot;Christian&quot; &quot;Science&quot; &quot;Church&quot; was on
<br>
Larry King Live and it was put forward that almost half of US medical
<br>
schools teach that some forms of spiritual or faith healings are
<br>
effective. So where is the scientific proof? And if this is true, will
<br>
they be lined up for grants under the president's faith-based public works
<br>
initiatives to practice faith-based healings?
