THis one has got me pretty freaked.  The DMCA is broken
<br>
legislation to start with.  But that isn't bad enough.  Now we
<br>
nab foreign nationals for supposedly violating its very loosely
<br>
worded strictures.  We grab them out of a conference and haul
<br>
them off to a foreign federal prison with no apparent access to
<br>
family, embassy or decent representation.  In a couple of weeks
<br>
the victim will reappear in SF so the court can decide whether
<br>
he should have a public defender ?!
<br>
<p>Is it just me or is this utter contemptible behavior on the part
<br>
of the US?  Am I just paranoid or does this mean that I can be
<br>
nabbed at any time either in my own country or in some other
<br>
country that happens to have laws on its books I never had a say
<br>
in or agreed to in any way if I should attend any event in that
<br>
country?
<br>
<p>Has it come to the point that laws can be declared and people
<br>
prosecuted without regard for nationality or what nation passed
<br>
the laws and with no guarantees at all of reasonable process or
<br>
room to address the merits of the case?
<br>
<p>What can be done to stop this madness?  No one is safe if this
<br>
is what the world has come to, and especially not if this is
<br>
what the US has come to.  
<br>
<p>- a smaller matter---
<br>
Adobe is also now on my boycott list.  Does anyone know of a
<br>
good PDF reader on Windoze?  I don't want to see their company
<br>
logo for a good long while on any machine I am on.  On Gnu/Linux
<br>
I use xpdf.  But it seems a bit of overkill to run an X server
<br>
on windoze just to view pdf files at work.

<em>&gt;    Russian Hacker Arrested by FBI Goes Missing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    posted by declan on Thursday July 19, @06:12PM
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    from the where-is-dmitry-sklyarov dept.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Dmitry Sklyarov is missing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    The 27-year old Russian programmer and hacker who was arrested after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Defcon was last spotted at 3 pm Monday, when he made a brief court
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    appearance in Las Vegas. He's charged with violating the 1998 Digital
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Millennium Copyright Act.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Now he's adrift inside the federal prison bureaucracy. A managing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    director of ElcomSoft, Sklyarov's employer, says he has no idea where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    his colleague is. Says ElcomSoft's Vladimir Katalov: &quot;Of course they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    really worry about him, because FBI/police didn't allow Dmit to talk
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    to his family.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    An informed source in the U.S. Attorney's office in San Francisco said
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    that after Sklyarov's court visit on Monday he was turned over to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    U.S. Marshals. The source said Sklyarov is likely out of contact since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    he's in transit to California. Typically prisoners are moved to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    holding facility in Oklahoma until there's a scheduled transport to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    San Francisco, much as FedEx routes packages through central hubs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    The government source said prosecutors receive almost no warning from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    the marshals when prisoners will appear -- sometimes they get a phone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    call, and sometimes the marshals simply take the prisoner to the court
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    with no notice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    The U.S. Marshals did not return phone calls. The U.S. Attorney's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    offices in San Francisco and Las Vegas said they did not know where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Sklyarov was.
