<em>&gt; Well, what I don't understand why, if restricting your ability to yell

</em><br>
<p>Not to disagree with you, but the answer is simple.  Republicans and
<br>
Democrats agree that yelling &quot;fire&quot; in a theater should be outlawed, so they
<br>
pass legislation to outlaw it.  They do not agree that the media biases
<br>
elections, so there is not enough consensus to pass a law on this.  You may
<br>
think both examples are equally obvious, but not all lawmakers would agree.
<br>
Hence, no law.
<br>
<p>I would have thought that events of the last election would prompt lawmakers
<br>
to block media polling of elections.  However, Democrats don't believe in
<br>
the bias of the media.  Republicans don't believe in more government
<br>
regulation.  The media put on a big campaign to self-regulate so that the
<br>
laws weren't needed.  In the end, nobody wanted to pass these laws.
