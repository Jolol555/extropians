<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; How much less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; likely do you think it will be when governments can no longer break up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; monopolies or unhealthy concentrations of power? Do you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; system of a free market offers any solution to consolidation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; power into fewer and fewer hands?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This only happens because of the government regulation that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raise the cost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of entry for small companies to the point where it doesn't happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am surprised. Do you really think that is the only reason power becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrated?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about when a small company tries to enter a market, the big players
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduce their prices to below cost so as to put the new entrant out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business? That is a tactic very often used.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How about this one: the big player buys the small startup.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are plenty of other tactics too, that are not so above-board.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes. None of which is particularly bad in my book. People will do
<br>
this. My only problem is with systems of regulation that stop people from
<br>
acting in the way in which they tend to -- it's wasteful of societal
<br>
resources.
<br>
<p>I should emphasise that the only yardstick that I care about is the rate of
<br>
technological advancement; a vigorous corporate environment in which
<br>
anything goes -- including all of the above mentioned tactics and many
<br>
others -- is par for the course and will lead to better and faster
<br>
advancement. What I don't like is an environment in which anything goes
<br>
except trying to compete with the incumbents -- this stops things from
<br>
advancing. Darwinism with healthy mutators, but regulation cuts down the
<br>
mutation rate.
<br>
<p>Companies that winge publicly about people having the temerity to compete
<br>
with them make me want to grind my teeth. Naming no names.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;All monopolies are unstable;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the long run, I agree with you. What I think worries most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incredible damage to the people and the economy that they can wreak along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way. Sure, they have to fall eventually, but they could last hundreds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of years... do you think the next generation should have to deal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with that legacy?
</em><br>
<p>What damage can a monopoly do if there's no regulation that prevents small
<br>
competitors from arising at a fairly rapid rate? Monopolies spur the
<br>
development of other companies and new technologies, because they
<br>
demonstrate the existance of a market. Sooner or later one of the newcomers
<br>
will take down the giant, and I think your timescale of centuries is way out
<br>
of proportion. Companies don't last much beyond decades in their chosen
<br>
market even with all the help of a friendly government to keep the
<br>
competition down.
<br>
<p>The damage that a monopoly causes when there is regulation to prevent new
<br>
companies arising in their space is to retard and slow down development
<br>
rates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am amazed that you would choose Microsoft here; they are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the kind of error that capitalism is prone to. They are corporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bullies that produce a substandard product, yet they have grown to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incredible riches through shrewd marketing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Have you read the Halloween documents?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween/index.html">http://www.opensource.org/halloween/index.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>Of course; I use and develop open source software.
<br>
<p>But going back to the above; nothing that Microsoft has done is particularly
<br>
wrong from the point of view of my technology advancement yardstick and the
<br>
way in which companies evolve. Microsoft tries all the tricks to keep power
<br>
and market share, other technologies and companies arise (constantly) to
<br>
challenge it, which means the advancement and new development has to go on
<br>
at a breakneck pace to keep ahead of the game. And in the end, MS of course
<br>
will lose large chunks of certain markets to open source concerns. Remains
<br>
to be seen where they'll be in a decade.
<br>
<p>My point being this is all fine; all par for the course. Things move
<br>
forward. Imagine a computer industry regulated like the telecommunications
<br>
industry...we'd all still be using 286s. If they'd even been invented.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I actually hope that somehow open-source will give us the model
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for moving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward into the future. I am not sure how yet, but it sure feels like it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combines the best of all worlds.
</em><br>
<p>It's a good philosophy for the development of software-like biological and
<br>
nanotechnological systems (wherein bugs can be really unpleasant), but I'm
<br>
sure this topic has been covered to death on this list. My take on open
<br>
source is more of an efficiency one: it's good because technology doesn't
<br>
end up lost in copyright when companies die, because it spurs growth by
<br>
making use of otherwise idle resources, because bugs are shallow. And a
<br>
million other reasons. Everything except documentation. When the open source
<br>
movement can figure a way to make documentation happen well and happen
<br>
early, without the intervention of a company, it'll conquer the world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Someone earlier said that power ends up in the hands of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of resources sooner or later in whatever system you're in. Very true. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;big advantage of capitalism over other forms of economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is doesn't attempt to get people to act in non-natural ways. Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fight the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;tide?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because of the abuse by those natural accumulations of power.
</em><br>
<p>People will always abuse power (for any definition of the word 'abuse').
<br>
They will also always seek to accumulate it. You cannot prevent this from
<br>
happening, so why try? It would be principled, but a waste of resources
<br>
better devoted to other causes that would have more beneficial effects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;And the reason decentralized control is good is above: it's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very good way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(indeed, probably the only way with the computing power available now) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;flow with the desires and actions of the governed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't argue with that. That's what I want too. What worries me is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism with its pricewars, mergers, and buyouts always ends up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; centralising power... just as all other systems do. It is a bit more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promising, and delivers a heck of a lot along the way, sure, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can see it ending up in the same place.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I think that this is a consequence of our inability to practice a
<br>
decent form of government. This leads to an inability to practice more than
<br>
a hobbled, protectionist form of capitalism. Now if we had a libertarian
<br>
participatory democracy of the form described in Enders Game (to save myself
<br>
some time typing here, damn I'm lazy), or at least some form of government
<br>
in which we did away with career politicians in favor of people who actually
<br>
know something about each issue that needs addressing....
<br>
<p>But that's a whole other thread to avoid getting into.
