I've thought long and hard about Greg Burch's responses to my e-mails on
<br>
this subject. I've refrained from responding so far because I don't want to
<br>
clutter the list with a simple expression of agreement. However, Greg has
<br>
produced two excellent posts.
<br>
<p>He concluded his most recent post
<br>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
--------------------------------------
<br>
I do believe that this suffering can be ameliorated, and I happen to think
<br>
that the technological advances we as transhumanists advocate will help to
<br>
do so greatly.  I also think that application of extropian values of
<br>
openness and toleration, based on the intrinsic value of the individual as
<br>
the prime locus of moral rights and duties is the ONLY solution to the
<br>
social and political aspects of these problems.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
---------------------------------------
<br>
<p>I certainly think that the values of openness and tolerance are enormously
<br>
important. The trouble is that these values are so often not being applied
<br>
by others. *We* can apply them all we like in our personal lives, and it has
<br>
a minimal impact on all this suffering and dislocation in the world.
<br>
Tanshuman technologies alone won't fix the problem. I urge everyone to read
<br>
Greg Egan's story &quot;Yeyuka&quot;.
<br>
<p>I don't have the solution but I do think it helps if we moderate our
<br>
transhumanist views by always thinking and writing out of an awareness of
<br>
what I was alluding to and what Greg has described. Otherwise, I don't see
<br>
how we can either be part of the solution or be intellectually credible in
<br>
the wider community.
<br>
<p>Sometimes I almost despair. The events of the past week certainly make me
<br>
feel helpless and frustrated.
<br>
<p>As I've said before, I *don't* support such ideas as reparations, though I
<br>
wonder where we would move in having something specific and constructive to
<br>
say about the same problems if we were motivated by a depth of compassion
<br>
together with our transhumanist philosophies.
<br>
<p>As it happens, I do have some specific views in the context of local debates
<br>
in my own country. These views put me somewhere in the political centre in
<br>
the debates, as it turns out. For example, I do not believe in Aboriginal
<br>
&quot;self determination&quot; but I do support the idea of a formal government
<br>
apology to the stolen generations, based on my view that an apology does
<br>
*not* mean you have to feel guilt - people seriously contributing to the
<br>
debate have moved beyond that simplistic and impatient argument, as I argued
<br>
at length in an earlier post.
<br>
<p>I don't presume to tell people from other countries what is best for them.
<br>
However, linking with some of the stuff Waldemar has been saying, if we are
<br>
going to be transhumanist public intellectuals we cannot simply be
<br>
dismissive of what is on the minds of the rest of the intellectual
<br>
community - that is so, even being pragmatic and leaving aside the sorrow in
<br>
our hearts at human suffering and the ideology-driven responses of left-wing
<br>
and right-wing fools.
<br>
<p>Sadly
<br>
<p>Russell
