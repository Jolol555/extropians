</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This is the essential idea of what I've called &quot;meta-rationality&quot;,
<br>
which I think is a key issue in economics, politics, and policy.
<br>
<p>Once upon a time, the main issue was: which is worse, &quot;market failure&quot;
<br>
or &quot;government failure&quot;?  That is, are rational people who know what
<br>
they want but may not know relevant facts better able to coordinate
<br>
actions and information aggregation through market or government
<br>
institutions?  In this approach there is little to complain about
<br>
independent individual choices - complaints only make sense when
<br>
choices are interdependent.
<br>
<p>Now the main issue seems to be turning to how various institutions
<br>
exacerbate or mitigate &quot;human failure&quot;, or the tendency of humans to
<br>
make bad choices even when those choices are not interdependent.
<br>
The rise of behavioral economics has highlighted various phenomena,
<br>
such as addiction and belief biases, which seem more easily explained
<br>
in terms of simple human irrationality.
<br>
<p>Often authors recommend the policies by which a wise and benevolent
<br>
power would seem to be able to counteract the biases produced by
<br>
typical irrationalities.  This approach, however, doesn't usually
<br>
deal seriously with the possibility of meta-rationality.  That is,
<br>
if people are capable of realizing that they have certain biases,
<br>
and have even a few simple ways to counter these biases, then it
<br>
can be enough to just tell them about their biases, or to give them
<br>
more ways to control themselves.
<br>
<p>For example, if people realize they might become addicted to
<br>
drugs, this can be enough to deter them from risking addiction.
<br>
If people realize that their future selves might &quot;live for the moment&quot;
<br>
and spend all their assets, they might choose savings plans that
<br>
do not allow all assets to be withdrawn at once.   If people realize
<br>
that they may irrationally sign certain kinds of contracts, they
<br>
can choose their contracts to be enforced by a legal regime where
<br>
arbitrators can void contracts based on such considerations.
<br>
<p>Of course it is also possible that most people are not meta-rational.
<br>
If so, benevolent paternalistic regulation might benefit most people.
<br>
Of course one might argue that the regulators are typically just as
<br>
irrational as the regulated.  Or that any excess rationality of
<br>
regulators is outweighed by harm from their divergent interests.
<br>
One might also argue that while regulation is good for those fools
<br>
over there, *you* should be exempt since you can see that you are
<br>
meta-rational.  But you may be self-deceived about this.
<br>
<p>We're hardly at a place where we can settle these issues.  But
<br>
maybe we have a better handle now on what the real issues are.
