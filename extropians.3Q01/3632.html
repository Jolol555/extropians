</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exit polls done by the media seem to match the actual computer counts in
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>And who does the exit polling? The media, which has a proven bias. The
<br>
fact is that exit pollsters have to correct exit poll data because
<br>
pollsters ALWAYS project more votes for democrats than what actually
<br>
occurs.
