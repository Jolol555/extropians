40,000 deaths annually in the U.S. driving cars, but depending on the

accounting, you would be shifting the loss somewhere else if you fixed this

problem.  Also, it is by no means the number three leading cause of death.

<br>
According to most sources, firearms accidents are *way* down the list of
<br>
causes of death; in the U.S. it is only a thousand or two annually.
<br>
<p>According to the U.S. government stats, accidents in aggregate are only the
<br>
fifth leading cause of death.  In fact, of the top ten leading causes of
<br>
death, only two are not medical/disease related -- accidents (including
<br>
vehicular) and suicide.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From everything I'm reading from the various government statistics, it would
</em><br>
seem that Jerry Mitchell is correct:  Every significant cause of death is
<br>
related to aging and limitations in medical technology.  Everything else in
<br>
aggregate is almost statistically insignificant in comparison.
