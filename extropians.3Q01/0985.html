We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity,
<br>
the most regressive force now operating in society.
<br>
ô¿ô
<br>
<p>Some folks just like The Unexplained, Mysteries, X-Files, Twilight Zone,
<br>
spooky kind of stuff because of its entertainment value. If religiosity is properly
<br>
and finally debunked, then spookiness just won't do, and we're left with
<br>
whatever awe-inspiring facets of the universe that real science can provide,
<br>
which seems rather dry in comparison.
<br>

<br>
<p><p>P.C.W. Davies asked: &quot;At one time people used to believe
<br>
that God explained the universe. It seems now that these laws
<br>
of physics are almost playing the role of God - that they're
<br>
omnipotent and omniscent&quot;.
<br>
<p>R. P. Feynman said: &quot;On the contrary. God was always invented
<br>
to explain mystery. God is always invented to explain those things
<br>
that you do not understand. Now when you finally discover how
<br>
something works, you get some laws which you're taking away
<br>
from God; you don't need him anymore. But you need him for the
<br>
other mysteries ... God is always associated with those things
<br>
that you do not understand. Therefore I don't think the laws can be
<br>
considered to be like God because they have been figured out.&quot;
<br>

<br>
<p>I like The Unexplained.
