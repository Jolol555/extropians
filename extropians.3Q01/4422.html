<p>Are you saying that they aren't thinking it through at a deep enough
<br>
level?  Sounds like they need to read Nanomedicine Section 3.5 on
<br>
Molecular Receptor Engineering, esp. 3.5.5 regarding the limits
<br>
of atomic positional accuracy.

<p><em>&gt; Yes, but you're not trying to make deep cages, and you're not trying to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>You can assemble deep cages from the inside out and sticking a methyl
<br>
group onto a molecule *is* sticking it on the surface.  I *will*
<br>
admit there are going to be some very difficult, perhaps even impossible
<br>
assembly problems without a programmable nanoassembler.  But the
<br>
phase space of what you can assemble by tacking things onto each
<br>
other or assembling things as nested hierarchies would seem to
<br>
be some reasonable subset of what you can assemble atom by atom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Chemists do random polymer libraries now, too.
</em><br>
<p>I was unaware of that.  Must make a pretty gooey mess.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They're molecules, not machines, though. Very different from biochemistry.
</em><br>
<p>Machines are subset of all the possible sets molecules.  Nature
<br>
has produced &quot;machines&quot;.  Polymerases, ion channels and the
<br>
proteosome are some that immediately come to mind.  I think
<br>
you are splitting hairs if you consider enzymes to not be machines.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not your typical computer scientist. They understand bits, but not atoms.
</em><br>
<p>I was thinking the A-life people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A few years back it really looked liked we were getting an open source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtual sandbox to study dynamics of small and not so small molecules and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assemblies of such interactively. Sadly, the efforts fizzled, so we're now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited to the efforts of a few academic researchers, in toto a few warm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bodies, and with a biology, not nano bias.
</em><br>
<p>I think that is because there is so much money in it due to the pharmaceutical
<br>
industry.  As soon as you develop some skill set in the area you get sucked
<br>
off into a commercial effort.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Computers are plenty fast now, even if you're not talking about a cluster.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We really need something painless, which lets people tweak atoms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interactively, and see what that stuff does, and interacts. Once we've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made a few interesting things in machina, we can start trying to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, and to see whether they would work in reality.
</em><br>
<p>I think Goddard is on the right track with this.  And if Nano@Home
<br>
picks up some steam and feeds into what Goddard et al are doing with
<br>
the simulations then I think your vision may be realized.  One thing
<br>
is for sure -- with a multi-teraflop machine coming online nanomachine
<br>
simulations will be doable.  If the simulations say they should work
<br>
thats going to up the pressure on the synthesists to actually build them
<br>
to confirm what the simulations predict.
