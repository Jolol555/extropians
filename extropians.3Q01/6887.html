<em>&gt; Parachutes or paragliders, rope bridges to nearby buildings...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I still favor the idea of building down instead of up. Tall buildings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always seemed a dumb idea since Towering Inferno. If you want a great view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put an eiffel tower kind of structure up there and make it twice the height
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the WTC buildings.
</em><br>
<p>The problem with building down is that they are not cost effective:
<br>
people won't pay hundreds or thousands of dollars per square foot for a
<br>
live panoramic view of a concrete wall.
<br>
<p>Nor is building down much safer: drop a fully fueled airliner straight
<br>
down on it, and unless it is hardened like a bunker, you will get top
<br>
level damage, and seal people at lower levels off to egress, while
<br>
barbecuing them with burning fuel that keeps leaking downward. Whoever
<br>
is in the bottom is dead.
<br>
<p>Towering inferno-like incidents have occured occasionally since that
<br>
movie was released in the late 70's. The strategies for dealing with
<br>
such a fire are well thought out, well established, and have saved many
<br>
lives already. The problem is that such strategies are are a bit
<br>
detrimental to the sort of situation we saw at the WTC.
<br>
<p>I think the best strategies for the current scenario are to add a
<br>
feature to current collision avoidance systems that recognises
<br>
building-mounted transponders as 'virtual mountains' to be avoided, and
<br>
that these systems cannot be turned off by crew without the proper code,
<br>
if at all.
