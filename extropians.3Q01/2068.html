<em>&gt; I think you're taking things too far. Like &quot;all property is theft&quot; you seem to argue that all association is guilt. I always thought individualists abhorred collective punishment. If responsability should be propagated to stock owners, what about funds?

&nbsp;Would my responsability go away if i sold my stock?
<br>
<p>Individualists abhor collective punishment in individualist systems. In
<br>
collectivist systems, responsibility IS collective, it is an inherent
<br>
function of the system. Having the power to delegate authority confers
<br>
the responsibility to delegate wisely, and consequences for not doing
<br>
so. Societies get the government they deserve.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And you don't seriosly mean that every single individual Swede is responsible for the highest taxation levels in the world (exept maybe for the person who shot Olof Palme). And that we deserve it! Come on, it's not that we're doing nothing about it eith
</em><br>
er. In fact, the second largest political party has always been Moderaterna, which is the most right-wing/liberal/&quot;libertarian&quot; one (the whatever to call it by US political nomenclatura) of the large ones.
<br>
<p>Those Swedes who are taking action to oppose injustice cannot be held
<br>
responsible, but those who continue to vote for any party that is in
<br>
collusion to the continuation of the injustice is responsible. The more
<br>
severe the injustice, the greater the responsibility and consequences to
<br>
those who acquiesced. I don't expect you to lead a violent insurgency
<br>
group to oppose generally non-violent actions of the state.
<br>
Proportionate use of force is mandated to maintain moral exculpability.
