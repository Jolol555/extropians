<p>
Maybe the government and megacorps have hundreds of 'public awareness'
<br>
specialists now at work, fine-tuning how current events will be spun to
<br>
support their agenda. Although I doubt the gov't is competent enough to
<br>
do that. One thing about people reeling in shock and grief, what you say
<br>
to them -- if you can know the proper words at the proper moment -- can
<br>
have a *huge* impact on the course of their future lives.
<br>
<p>How can we spin this moment to insert extropian memes into the
<br>
environment?
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems the left has the clear advantage in getting
<br>
people to open up and yak about their lives. The lack, as it seems to
<br>
me, of honest deep psychological discussion on the extropian list -- and
<br>
I emphasize, for clear reasons of personal liberty and respect for the
<br>
individual -- may hinder efforts to take advantage of this moment.
<br>
<p>One effect this tragedy seems to have generated is vastly increased
<br>
situational awareness in people. People are looking around. They are
<br>
looking out for themselves and each other. The number of distractions
<br>
seems to be less -- I've seen considerably fewer book readers on the
<br>
washington dc metro the last two days. I feel safer than ever, and much
<br>
safer than I ever did 'protected' by the police. Say something like this
<br>
to someone who seems frightened, see if it makes them feel better.
<br>
<p>(newsflash: just saw a network news report about stewardesses refusing
<br>
to board their aircraft because they're *not being searched*.)
<br>
<p>So, I've started buying up copies of Mark Steigler's _Earthweb_ and
<br>
giving them to friends. It's short, a quick, easy, and exciting read,
<br>
explaining a powerful idea, an idea that shows how spending effort to
<br>
really, really understand what's going on can not only make for a better
<br>
planet but also generate big bucks!
<br>
<p>It's a small token effort but I figure it's something. Anybody else?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Mike
