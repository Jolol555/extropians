Subject: Re: Is IQ usefully predictive? (and not in this case)
<br>
<p>&lt;The man with the highest IQ ever may have been a fellow by name of
<br>
William James Sidis (1898-1944). Sidis's IQ can only be approximately
<br>
known even though he took many IQ tests, the tests were just not up to
<br>
the task, he was off the charts. Abraham Sterling, director of New York
<br>
City's Aptitude Testing Institute said &quot; he easily had an IQ between 250
<br>
and 300, I have never heard of anybody with such an IQ. I would say
<br>
that he was the most prodigious intellect of our entire generation&quot;.
<br>
<p>So what did this &quot;prodigious intellect&quot; accomplish in his 46 years?
<br>
He wrote a book about streetcar transfers, that's about it.
<br>
It seems high IQ and genius are not quite synonymous.
<br>

<p>W.J. Sidis is an anomalous example.  You can be highly
<br>
intelligent but emotionally unstable..which is often the case
<br>
when you have no real friends, only detractors and sycophants.
<br>
I understand Sidis book on transfers is considered brilliant,
<br>
if rather..ahem..focused.  BTW While I wouldn't say this
<br>
about most superheavyweights in the IQ game... Sidis was
<br>
so brilliant I would have to ask... what did he do that he 
<br>
never wrote down or shared?  You're ignoring the substantial
<br>
possibility that he was just disinterested in interacting enough
<br>
to demonstrate what he had accomplished.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at all the problems Mr. Tesla had at the social level.
