</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Firstly, you're personalizing a nation of millions. Don't do that. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all you know, the average guy on the streets of Kingston is just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposed to the taking out of such loans as you are. (Do I need to read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you the standard libertarian &quot;the state is not the same as the sum of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its citizens&quot; speech at this point?)
</em><br>
<p>Depends on what context you want to give it.
<br>
<p>I think you are taking my point wrong, though. If you know that someone
<br>
is going to lose their job (i.e. lose their case in the WTO on
<br>
protectionism of banana exports), its a really really dumb idea to lend
<br>
them money, especially money to be spent on expanding banana
<br>
cultivation.
<br>
<p>The 19% rate is simply a disinscentive against borrowing for such a dumb
<br>
purpose. It's saying &quot;We don't want to be seen as discriminating against
<br>
you by refusing to lend to you, but if you are going to be dumb enough
<br>
to borrow money for this purpose, you are going to pay for it&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Secondly, there may well be circumstances which force current politicians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there to take out such loans, even against their better judgement. Such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as, say, the need to service interest payments on previous loans taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out by previous governments. (In other words, it's elephants all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way down -- at least, to the point where nobody now alive deserves to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be saddled with the blame for a bad decision.) Yes, taking these loans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a dumb idea, in the absence of other conditions. For all we know,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there may well be conditions that make _not_ taking the loans an even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse option in the short term.
</em><br>
<p>Whether it's turtles all the way down or not is irrelevant. Keep in mind
<br>
I'm not too sympathetic toward the IMF either, but at least they are
<br>
starting to get their act together. There are plenty of measures that a
<br>
country like Jamaica can take to pull itself out of the hole by the
<br>
bootstraps. For example, they can drastically revise their banking and
<br>
taxation laws to encourage an influx of deposits from overseas
<br>
investors, and structure their social welfare programs to encourage
<br>
people to obtain long term birth controls like Norplant.
<br>
<p>I understand completely that being in a situation where you have a large
<br>
percent of the population who are unskilled, unemployable, and unwilling
<br>
to fix that, you have a major mess on your hands, one that requires
<br>
either war, famine, epidemic, or other natural disaster to fix.
<br>
<p>The purpose of the 19% loan is to send a price signal to the rulers that
<br>
they can no longer fix today's problems by borrowing from the future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thirdly -- and this is the most important point -- conditions attached to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the loans are being used as instruments of state power. That is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real bad problem here; the recipient of the loan isn't free to use it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; productively.
</em><br>
<p>No, they are not free to spend it on social welfare programs. There is
<br>
nothing wrong with a person to attach stipulations on how THEIR money is
<br>
going to be used by those they lend it to. A bank would get mighty
<br>
pissed if I took out an auto loan and used the money on a vacation to
<br>
Fiji.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I hold a metaphorical gun to your head and say &quot;here's ten thousand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollars -- you must repay me at 19% interest within ten years or come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back for another loan to service the interest payments, and you're not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only allowed but required to spend this loan on heroin,&quot; you wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thank me, would you? Seems to me that this, in human terms, is pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much exactly what the IMF is doing.
</em><br>
<p>I don't. I see it as &quot;You're not allowed to use this money on heroin, or
<br>
food stamps, but only on buying a car so you can get your ass to work
<br>
each day.&quot;
