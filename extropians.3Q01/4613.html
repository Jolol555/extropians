<p>
For those of you who did not see it last night, PBS had a program
<br>
on P.O.V. titled &quot;Life and Debt&quot; about the havoc being caused in
<br>
Jamaica by &quot;globalization&quot; and &quot;free trade&quot;.
<br>
<p>It was done by filmmaker Stephanie Black and had an interesting
<br>
interweaving of Jamaican farmers, former prime minister Michael
<br>
Manley, IMF deputy director Stanley Fisher and foreign people
<br>
vacationing in Jamaica.
<br>
<p>When I first started watching it I thought to myself --
<br>
&quot;oh here we go, yet another green agenda program&quot; but
<br>
as time went by, I found myself re-thinking the issues.
<br>
<p>What became apparent from the program is how a system seems
<br>
to have come into existence that is really set up to screw
<br>
the third world countries.
<br>
<p>What happens is a country comes to the IMF for a loan.  The
<br>
IMF says ok, but the conditions are that you have to lower
<br>
any barriers to imports (because free trade is a good thing).
<br>
The country says ok.  So what happens is in comes a flood
<br>
of foreign goods, esp. U.S. food, produced by corporate
<br>
agri-business.  These come in at prices lower than foods
<br>
can be produced domestically and as a result the Jamaican
<br>
farmers are driven out of business.  At first I found myself
<br>
thinking -- &quot;So what? The consumers are getting the benefits
<br>
of lower food prices.&quot; -- but then I realized the problem --
<br>
the U.S. exports are being produced with very large government
<br>
subsidies.
<br>
<p>If that wasn't bad enough, the IMF loans to Jamaica are at
<br>
outrageous rates (19% was quoted) and there are clauses
<br>
in the contracts that Jamaica cannot loan the money out
<br>
at a lower rate to its farmers (so they could in theory
<br>
modernize their farms with machinery to compete effectively
<br>
against American imports).  So the system is setup to *keep*
<br>
a 3rd world country in that position.
<br>
<p>Then to top it all off, Jamaica had a preferential relationship
<br>
with Britian with regard to the marketing of its banana crop.
<br>
Apparently corporate banana growers who have large farms in
<br>
Latin/South America got President Clinton to challenge this
<br>
under the WTO rules and they won the case, so Britian had
<br>
to open up the market (perhaps some slight benefit for
<br>
British consumers, terrible for Jamaican banana planation
<br>
workers and owners who see demand fall).  This change
<br>
doesn't benefit any U.S. farmers, only the corporations
<br>
who own the offshore plantations.
<br>
<p>Now, I'm sure there are other sides to the story but it sure
<br>
made me wonder if the corporate Agribusiness interests
<br>
weren't influencing the IMF (and other bank) policies
<br>
sufficiently to slant the playing field in their direction.
<br>
<p>For sure in my mind I don't think the IMF or the President
<br>
should be demanding that third world countries eliminate import tariffs
<br>
or that preferential trade relationships must be ended while the U.S.
<br>
and Europe are subsidizing agriculture to the degree that they do.
<br>
<p>The show left me with the feeling that that the foxes have been
<br>
left in charge of the hen-house.  Try to see it if you get a
<br>
chance.  It may provide you with a good example of where things
<br>
Extropians would normally accept without thinking really require
<br>
a much more detailed analysis.
<br>
