</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;In 1999 (the last year available), total &quot;Farm marketings&quot; were $188.6B.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Government payments&quot; were $20.6B or almost 11% of the &quot;marketings&quot; value.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's quite a stretch to call subsidies amounting to 11% of &quot;marketings&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value low. In fact, in at least some individual cases (I suspect in MANY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such cases) the subsidies make the difference between a net loss and a net
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike Lorrey continues:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; They don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsidize low prices either, they are used to prop up prices. If we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ended subsidies entirely, US food prices would be far lower. &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I need to do some research on this, as I'm presently only aware of what's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening locally. I get a newsletter each month from my local Agricultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extension Service, a branch of the USDA. The subsidies currently being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offered are in the nature of &quot;disaster&quot; relief. Farmers go to their partners
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (maybe more accurate to say their bosses) the bankers, mortgage everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they own, and put the whole wad into a thousand acres of one or two verities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of corn. No diversification, and it's all planted at the same time, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accordance with the instructions from the seed and chemical companies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which, these days, is generally the same company). If the corn burns up in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a drought, it's considered a disaster rather than poor planning on the part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the farmer, and the federal gov't bails the farmer out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The real beneficiaries of this policy are the banks, the seed/chemical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies, and the politicians. I fail to see how this policy props up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices. Farm prices are currently artificially low, and if more realistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accounting methods were used by farmers, I don't think even the subsidies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would keep many farms from showing losses.
</em><br>
<p>Farmers get paid to keep land out of cultivation, and in the case of
<br>
situations like the Northeast Dairy Compact, farmers get paid if the
<br>
price of milk falls below a targeted price, and distributors/retailers
<br>
within the region must pay at least the target price.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Among other misleading items on the financial statements is this: today's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominant methods of farming rely on what you might call strip mining the top
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soil. In most cases where a natural resource is used up a bit each year, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business must annually book a fraction of the value of the resource as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depletion expense. This is not done by farmers, nor do farmers relying on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-rechargeable aquifers for irrigation (such as the Olalla) book depletion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expense for water consumed.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but most farmers run into big trouble if they try to utilize
<br>
sludge to fertilize and regenerate their soil. The NIMBY attitudes of
<br>
the ignorant keep the situation as it is.
