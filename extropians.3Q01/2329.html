<p><em>&gt; &gt; There is no need to put dykes around Florida, for if we hold

<em>&gt; &gt; Northern ice and make for more productive land.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You don't expect Florida voters to agree to that, do you?
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  They are among those who have the most to gain.  I am suggesting
<br>
we learn first how to take up excess water in order to hold the sea level
<br>
where it is currently, indefinitely.  Step 1 will be to buy up land around
<br>
the great inlands seas, such as the Caspian and Black, and divert water
<br>
into them, demonstrating that we *can* lower the sea level on demand.
<br>
Then we start the warming, reclaiming much of the north countries.
<br>
<p>If we put our minds to it, we could find many good ways to store
<br>
fresh water on what is currently wetlands or unused dry land.  We may
<br>
need to move some earth.  We can do that.  We can use the water as
<br>
a massive heat sink to moderate climates.
<br>
<p>Part of this vision is to stop the waste resulting from letting rivers dump into
<br>
<p>the sea.  Consider the salmon situation.  Looks to me like we could
<br>
build an artificial river of sorts, where we dump hatchery smolts into
<br>
the sea with a limited amount of water out of a pipe perhaps 4 meters
<br>
in diameter with a flow rate of perhaps 50-200 cubic meters per second
<br>
flowing into Puget Sound in place of the current Columbia River Waste
<br>
Site.  The Salmon go to sea, eat stuff, get big, then when they come
<br>
back, you catch em all, every last one of em.  Any that get upstream
<br>
are just wasted food.  Extract some roe, start the whole cycle again.
<br>
The wealth created in fish biomass alone would stagger the imagination.
<br>
<p>Then all that stored water can be piped all over the place, and vaaaast
<br>
stretches of land can be reclaimed.  One really needs to look down, next
<br>
time you fly over it.
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey suggested a problem with inadequate soils for trees.  We can
<br>
deal with this problem too, by establishing species that are water intensive
<br>
but not necessarily soil intensive, such as rain forest trees, which deal with
<br>
low soil quantities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I also don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think most Floridians would want to leave the country to move back north.
</em><br>
<p>Im not suggesting that they do, however in my vision, the north country
<br>
from whence most Floridians came would eventually get a climate
<br>
resembling the Sunshine State.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Besides, we have developed lands and infrastructure.  You are trading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive, devolped, popular land for undeveloped, remote wilderness.
</em><br>
<p>No trade necessary.  This whole scheme hinges upon our ability to
<br>
control water sufficiently to hold the sea level at its current level.  Note
<br>
that even this is &quot;unnatural&quot; for sea levels were rising before humans
<br>
did anything to affect them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of, course I am trying to retire down in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Florida.  (&quot;It's always about Florida, isn't it Harv?&quot;)
</em><br>
<p>Ive nothing against Florida.  I have many fond memories from there.
<br>
Its not just Florida.  There is a lot of valuable land close to the sea.
<br>
We can stop the sea rise and keep those places.  We can make a
<br>
bunch of new fresh water inland seas, creating a bunch of new
<br>
valuable waterfront property where now is wasteland, with nothing
<br>
but a bunch of weeds and unemployed wild animals on it that dont
<br>
pay taxes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I guess I agree with you in theory.  But I'm not quite ready to say that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can throw away safety and precautions now on the assumption that we'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figure out how to fix it later.
</em><br>
<p>So fix it first.  Demonstrate we can lower sea levels now.  Then get
<br>
serious about warming the planet.  One of the things we will need
<br>
is more people.  Come on, you extropians, get breeding.  The greens
<br>
claim we broke this planet by accident.  If so, then we can fix it on
<br>
purpose, and fix it better than it ever was.
