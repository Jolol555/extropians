<p>Peter!  I like your thinking, bud!  Why dont you say things like
<br>
this at the nanoschmoozes?  You are always so quiet there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  For stopping an all-out attack by a country like Russia, I don't forsee
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Totally agree.  I dont mind maintaining a MAD strategy
<br>
against those biggies that have demonstrated responsibility
<br>
with their nukes.  But without some form of SDI you know
<br>
eventually the world will be held hostage to some outfit like
<br>
Outer Butfukistan demanding equal say in world politics
<br>
because of their one shining nuclear missile.  spike
