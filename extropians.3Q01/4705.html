<p><em>&gt; Is there any reasonable chance that you are more or less then that?

<p>See above.

<p>This is not a problem of computer science but of biomodelers, mostly
<br>
computational neuroscience folks. The computer science folks are typically
<br>
less than instrumental, unless they're number crunchers, or hardware
<br>
people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; something people will need?
</em><br>
<p>If you want to remove certain aspects of you it is of course possible. The
<br>
word to google for is agnosia. You can do funky things with body image
<br>
edits. Some of them would even make sense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about hundreds of other minor sensations and habits that will

</em><br>
<p>Make a dumb brute force upload, then you don't need to worry about
<br>
anything. Then you can start tinkering, should you feel an irresistible
<br>
urge.

<p>You don't have to understand anything about the emergent properties. Just

model the physical layer with sufficient fidelity, and the emergent stuff

<br>
<p><em>&gt; understand the monkey. Please hand me a banana.

<p>I see that people still don't understand that you don't have to understand
<br>
anything but the physical layers to simulate monkeys. Or bananas, and
<br>
their interaction with monkeys.
