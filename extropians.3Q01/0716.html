<em>&gt; &gt;Do you think a few minor skirmishes of words are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;war&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>I am not referring to the minor skirmishes you are
<br>
talking about. I rahter enjoy a minor skirmish. But
<br>
there was som slashing going on and I don't know what
<br>
contact to take it in. Are you all just kidding when
<br>
you threaten to block someone's address just because
<br>
you don't want to hear what they have to say or to
<br>
punish them? I don't recall who did this--had to get
<br>
rid of a lot of these emails, getting very jammed. If
<br>
so, it did not come across that way, I repeat, did
<br>
not.
<br>
<p>So if it was all in jest, fine, but there was a lot of
<br>
fur flying.
<br>
<p>Extropian
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;righteousness?  
</em><br>
<p>This is very extreme, but I understand your point. My
<br>
point is we have better things to do.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It is this foolishness and needless polarization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I wished
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to bring to examination.
</em><br>
<p>I did not polarize. I think it was J.R. Malloy who was
<br>
so angry with ME Smith, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the
<br>
polarization began there. If we are going to make this
<br>
extropian life work, the hours we spent regarding this
<br>
issue with such heat could have been spent more
<br>
constructively.
<br>
<p>If I am mistaken, I apologize.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thank you Samantha for some lucid thinking on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thread.  I agree with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost all posts except those whose aim is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chastise religion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spirituality or the church.  (How many is that? -:))
</em><br>
<p>I am with you, although I do not agree with chastising
<br>
atheism or anti-theism. 
<br>
<p>People who go to church,
<br>
<em>&gt; people who value ideas other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than extropian ideas, people who have a desire or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need for spirituality are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not backward and unintelligent.  Many are creative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and highly intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and who simply see things a different way because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deeply ingrained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief systems, early imprinting, fear of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unknown, social conditioning,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professional affiliation, or simply like the music,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atmosphere and wine.
</em><br>
<p>So it doesn't matter if it is debunked or not,
<br>
perhaps.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unless and until those who petition their particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religions views to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impede the direction, progress and accomplishments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanist views, the only war is within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain of rigidity. 
</em><br>
<p>How true. This rigidity spills over into atheist
<br>
views, just in the opposite way. There is a rigid
<br>
following of almost any charismatic magnet, science,
<br>
rock and roll, satanism, politics and many other
<br>
subgroups of humanity also being attractive belief
<br>
systems.  
<br>
<p>Examination is wonderful. Let's do this instead of
<br>
fight and waste time. Time is what we are seeking more
<br>
of, and high quality time, if I am not mistaken. That
<br>
is what I got out of the extropian principles.
<br>
<p>If I am mistaken, again I apologize.
