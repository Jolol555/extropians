Yes, there were more than 3 Allied nations... 
<br>
<p>The UK forces included commonwealth armies from Australia and 
<br>
New Zealand (the Anzacs), Canada, India (the Ghurka Rifles), and
<br>
South Africa (as well as smaller colonies and ex-colonies)... and
<br>
the Russians certainly had contingents of Kazakh, Turkmen, Tadjik,
<br>
Uzbek, Yakutsk, Ukranian, etc. soldiers from all the Soviet regions.
<br>
<p>Next, we can move on to the fact that the Polish government in exile
<br>
and the organized partisan army which reported to Sikorski fielded more
<br>
troops in WWII than France (according to the book History of Polish
<br>
Forces in WWII), despite being sold up the river at Yalta and conveniently
<br>
forgotten...  so those who bring up France as the 4th ally need to bring
<br>
up Poland as the 5th.
<br>
<p>Next, we can move on to the fact that the Nationalist Chinese of Chiang
<br>
Kai-Shek were long involved with a war against Japan (this was actually
<br>
the beginning of WWII, prior even to the invasion of Poland in 1939...
<br>
prior even to the annexation of the Sudetenland and the Anschulss).  
<br>
<p>Next, we can move on to the fact that organized resistance in not only
<br>
Poland, but France, Norway, Holland, Greece, Yugoslavia, and several other 
<br>
occupied countries (including occupied areas of Russia) contributed 
<br>
substantially to intelligence gathering and disruption of supply and 
<br>
communications lines for Axis troops.  
<br>
<p>In Asia, Indonesia, Burma, and numerous smaller Southeast Asian and 
<br>
pacific island nations were involved in the war on both sides - but
<br>
mostly on the side of the allies.
<br>
<p>Note also that the Axis powers included not only Germany, Italy, and 
<br>
Japan, but also Romania, Finland, Hungary, Slovakia, Croatia, and 
<br>
collaborationist elements (which were very prevalent in fighting against
<br>
the Russians) in the Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and the lands
<br>
of the Cossacks and Tatars. 
<br>
<p>If you read the history, WWII really completely engulfed Europe and Asia
<br>
in war, and involved armies from every continent (though minimally so
<br>
from South America).  They called it a world war for a reason...
<br>
<p><p>The lesson for contemporary times is that a determined enemy requires a
<br>
determined fight.  I don't know if the US and its allies armies have 
<br>
sufficient morale to win a protracted ground war, or if the American
<br>
people and their Western compatriots truly feel justified in bringing
<br>
the horrors of another World War to either the enemy population or
<br>
their own... However, I do think that the Hitler parallels are correct
<br>
in terms of succeptability to appeasement and general lack of concern
<br>
for soldiers or civilians on either side as long as they get the power
<br>
they crave.  
<br>
<p><p>LL+P,
<br>

<p>Surely there were more than three allied countries in WWII. I can
<br>
understand that Russia or the U.S. could have beaten nazi germany on its
<br>
own given sufficient time, but presuming the 3rd ally is Britain, I
<br>
would think that would be much more iffy.
