<em>&gt; &gt; I think that the best option is secession of some small population US

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which seeks to get 20,000 libertarian minded people to move to one state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to tip its political balance toward libertarian policies if not outright
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; secession. Current top candidates are New Hampshire and Alaska, among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; others like Wyoming, etc. Note that the secessionist party in Alaska
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allegedly got 25% of the vote in the last election, and New Hampshire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has elected more libertarian state legistlators (25) in the last ten

<em>&gt; Hahahahaha hehehehe!  We can barely get 20,000 people to attend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a protest rally on these subjects and you want to get them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lay their lives, fortunes and citizenship on the line to

<em>&gt; actually seceed from the US?  It is a fun dream but I think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is really dreamland right now.  Assuming you can find these find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarian brave souls, do you think they will have the means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the will to develop a strong enough Defense to survive?  Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are we talking major technology breakthrough that throws a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forcefield around the entire state?
</em><br>
<p>a) NH's state constitution retains the right to secede, and has since
<br>
before it became the 9th and ratifying signor of the US Constitution.
<br>
<p>b) What makes you think a defense is needed beyond the existing state
<br>
Air Guard units?
<br>
<p>c) YOU can barely get 20 people to agree with your cynicism, but you
<br>
don't seem to be aware that the Free State Project has been done before.
<br>
The fellow who started the current incarnation is a Yale person who has
<br>
dug up evidence that there was a similar organization in the early 70's
<br>
at Yale whose purpose was to flood a small state with left wingers to
<br>
tip its political balance. The state they chose was Vermont, and they
<br>
did get the numbers they wanted to move there, and look at the result
<br>
today: socialized medicine, gay marriage, anti-logging laws, and a
<br>
confiscatory state education finance law, as well as anti-growth laws
<br>
and a ban on BGH in the state.
