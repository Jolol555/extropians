<br>
<p><em>&gt; Government was originally formed (if I remember my history correctly) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give the population some way to control the powerful individuals (lords,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kings, and barons) that oppressed people.
</em><br>
<p>In Western Civilization, governments evolved from feudal lords
<br>
who oppressed people as badly as any government since.  In
<br>
England and many other countries, royal power did not expand
<br>
to &quot;control powerful individuals&quot; EXCEPT as those individuals
<br>
posed a threat to royal power.  English royal power in turn
<br>
oppressed many people, especially in Ireland, Scotland, and
<br>
England.  The relatively mild oppression of people in the
<br>
American colonies---far less than the U.S. government's
<br>
taxes and restrictions today---brought about the first
<br>
serious, successful effort to enshrine rights and freedom
<br>
from government exploitation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have a new religion taking hold around the world at the moment that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convinces people to let the most powerful companies and individuals rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the planet unopposed in the name of &quot;market forces&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>This &quot;rule&quot; is a misnomer to the extent that companies offer people
<br>
free choices whether to buy their products or not.  But I agree
<br>
that by buying off governments, and thereby using government
<br>
power and regulation, corporations share the moral blame.  (The
<br>
solution, rather than to appeal to their high-mindedness or to
<br>
endlessly denounce them as interested only in themselves, is to
<br>
amputate this use of raw power by limiting the extent to which
<br>
governments control everything; thus buying off the government
<br>
would mean so much less and be much less tempting.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People are indoctrinated, perversely, to relinquish all control with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith that the invisible hand of the market will balance all things.
</em><br>
<p>Free-marketeers are asking people to relinquish forcible control
<br>
through government edicts and laws in favor of market forces,
<br>
which, yes, to many people are much worse.  Especially to idealists
<br>
who believe that if we can just get good, honest men and women to
<br>
run things (via central authority), then our chances will be maximized.
<br>
Opinions vary, of course, but the record seems to indicate that the more authoritarian
<br>
that societies become---i.e., the more they are under
<br>
centralized control---the worse they are.
