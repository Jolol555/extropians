Russell:
<br>
<p>Your post prompts me to put forward thoughts I've had for a LONG time.
<br>
Thus, a very LONG post:

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It's a major misconception that extropians and other transhumanists lack
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; empathy or even sympathy toward others.  Some on this list may feel that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way, but it's clearly a personal stance and not an extropian view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fair enough. I've never seen such a lack of empathy in you, personally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Natasha.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What worries me, however, is that I've seen on this list an
</em><br>
extraordinarily
<br>
<em>&gt; high level of impatience with, and lack of imaginative identification
</em><br>
with,
<br>
<em>&gt; other people's current and historical sufferings. It's higher than I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encountered in any other forum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The tentative conclusion I coming to is that the problem is the other way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around: that (economic) libertarianism - which has *some* links with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropianism, even if only of an historical nature - is attractive to,
</em><br>
among
<br>
<em>&gt; others, those who already have the emotional responses I've described.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps there is a sense in which none of this matters for the cause of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism. However, I'd like to think that transhumanism can be linked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to other values that intellectually engaged and emotionally decent people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take seriously. I dread to think what impression is being created in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds of any postgraduate students - the public intellectuals of
</em><br>
tomorrow -
<br>
<em>&gt; who might be poring over the list's archives trying to understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism from a sociological or similar perspective. If they do come
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; a misconception that transhumanism is linked to inhumane attitudes, I'd
</em><br>
say
<br>
<em>&gt; they'd have some justification for it.
</em><br>
<p>First, I offer some material (slightly edited) from a recent off-list
<br>
exchange with a long-time subscriber and ExI supporter, who shall remain
<br>
nameless:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

a

the

the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different styles of thought and discourse among &quot;the two cultures&quot;: In

the

<em>&gt; &gt; not.  In the humanities and politics, truth, testability and
</em><br>
fruitfulness
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are important, but they aren't the whole story.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your challenge to everyone to &quot;raise&quot; the level discussion by considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both viewpoints sounds good on paper, but I'm not sure if it has any
</em><br>
chance
<br>
<em>&gt; of working. You may very well end up with only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the set of people who are actually interested in discussing things both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways. Unfortunately they may end up being very unspecialized and unable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to really discuss the issues well either way. Sure you'll have a few
</em><br>
people
<br>
<em>&gt; like yourself who are so advanced that they can hold their own in either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place, but the vast majority of people can't. You'll end up with
</em><br>
half-assed
<br>
<em>&gt; discussions while the real experts on both sides bail out. We've seen that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think as the list has tilted recently more and more into cultural
</em><br>
issues.
<br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps your goal is to move into 100% cultural discussion? There are many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other lists that have sprung up for the science side of things, I guess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they could pick up the slack...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm concerned you're using your own experiences and abilities to hope for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a list that in reality just isn't very likely to happen. Perhaps if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list continues to drive itself further into the ground a year or two from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now you might finally consider reworking it to separate the two points of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view into their own lists, or come up with some other solution.
</em><br>
<p>I appreciate the compliment ( I think :-) .  I'm glad you made this point,
<br>
because it touches on something I've been thinking about since I sent
<br>
the earlier post upon which you comment.  I wasn't necessarily admonishing
<br>
the &quot;science types&quot; to &quot;consider both viewpoints&quot; (i.e. the
<br>
humanities/political way of looking at things and the scientific way).
<br>
Instead, I was simply suggesting that if people DO engage in discussions of
<br>
culture and politics, that they not confuse the two modes of thought and
<br>
discourse.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the &quot;science types&quot; are by no means the only offenders!  This
<br>
reminds me of a comment that Robin Hanson made some time ago, when he asked
<br>
why it was that few on the list would jump into a highly technical
<br>
scientific or engineering discussion to offer strong opinions when they
<br>
hadn't done their homework or engaged in the kind of basic background study
<br>
that would allow them to have an informed opinion, but in his area of deep
<br>
expertise -- economics and institutional design -- every &quot;Tom, Dick and
<br>
Harry&quot; feels like they have a perfect right to pop off with opinions about
<br>
the most fundamental concepts without studying the basic literature or
<br>
familiarizing themselves with the background material in the area.  (I'm
<br>
paraphrasing Robin, of course.)
<br>
<p>I often feel the same way about discussions I see here (and elsewhere, to be
<br>
sure) about history, law, politics and culture.  I've devoted a lifetime of
<br>
study to these areas and feel I'm barely able at this stage of my life to
<br>
begin to draw some (often quite tentative) conclusions.  Just as folks on
<br>
the technical side can quickly spot someone with whom they may have a
<br>
disagreement, but who clearly has the background knowledge to be a
<br>
worthwhile contributor, the same is true in the humanities.  For instance,
<br>
even before I looked into the bibliography of his work, I knew that Damien
<br>
Broderick was a &quot;heavyweight&quot; from his first few posts here.  Conversely,
<br>
while it's sometimes a rewarding experience to see people who don't have a
<br>
humanities background figuring out some of the basics for themselves, I
<br>
often have to squelch the urge to counsel that someone should read the basic
<br>
canon of philosophical and historical work before they undertake the job of
<br>
prescribing a &quot;new world order&quot;.
<br>
<p>Oh well, I guess I'm feeling a little curmudgeonly this afternoon . . .
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
<br>
<p>With those thoughts in mind, I'll give vent to some more.  Russell, as
<br>
attorneys, you and I are professional communicators, rhetoricians and
<br>
diplomats.  I'm sure you've experienced the same cringing reaction I often
<br>
have when I see a brash, undiplomatic post here that is the rhetorical
<br>
equivalent of flinging lit matches in a leaky refinery.  I've been a
<br>
subscriber to this list for many years now and I'm still not used to this
<br>
kind of verbal behavior and know that I never will become comfortable or
<br>
happy with it.  As the de facto &quot;list policeman&quot; I've thought long and hard
<br>
about what could be done to raise the levels of both civility and quality on
<br>
this list, which I value very highly as one of the best sources of ideas and
<br>
inspiration I've ever had in my life.  None of the many ideas that have been
<br>
considered have offered the promise of achieving those goals without
<br>
sacrificing the openness that we also value very highly.
<br>
<p>With all that said, what about the &quot;extraordinarily high level of impatience
<br>
with, and lack of imaginative identification with, other people's current
<br>
and historical sufferings&quot;?  First, I do believe there's truth in this
<br>
observation, although not by any means for all posters, much less the vast
<br>
majority of subscribers who never or rarely post.  Second, I think much of
<br>
it traces to the two factors I've identified above, i.e. 1) a lack of
<br>
familiarity with the basic canon of knowledge in the humanities; and 2) the
<br>
lack of rhetorical &quot;polish&quot; in many of the posts here.  The first factor is
<br>
substantive, the second formal, although nonetheless important.
<br>
<p>Taking the second factor first, I confess to having considered the
<br>
possibility of starting a &quot;charm school for techno-geeks&quot; before the
<br>
dot-bust.  Alas, with the reduction in disposable wealth in that community,
<br>
that little idea will have to await the next tech-boom.  Seriously, though,
<br>
I agree that the indelicate manner in which many transhumanists and
<br>
extropians express themselves in writing does no service to the cause of
<br>
spreading our shared ideas and values.  I do NOT advocate submission to any
<br>
kind of Orwellian &quot;PC Newspeak,&quot; but rather simple care in expressing our
<br>
already radical ideas and values in a way that doesn't immediately shut
<br>
minds to their merit.  Some may recall that my talk at Extro4 focused on
<br>
this.
<br>
<p>As for the first point, I certainly do see some fairly ham-fisted and
<br>
frankly ill-informed statements about social policy, law and economics here
<br>
that are sometimes of the &quot;fringe libertarian&quot; variety.  Strangely, this is
<br>
a more noticeable phenomenon (to me) now than it was, say five years ago
<br>
when the list composition did not include so many people who wouldn't
<br>
identify themselves as &quot;libertarian&quot; of some kind.  Wider notice of
<br>
extropianism specifically and transhumanism in general has brought folks
<br>
onto the list from outside its fairly narrow US West Coast techno-geek
<br>
original population.  (I remember in my early days on the list receiving an
<br>
offlist lunch invitation from one of the list &quot;originals&quot;, my correspondent
<br>
assuming that I must live in the Bay Area, a statistically safe assumption
<br>
at the time.)  What I've seen is that more recent subscribers whose politics
<br>
fit more comfortably within mainstream &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; categories make
<br>
posts assuming a common vocabulary and value set that in fact isn't shared
<br>
by many on the list.  This ignites a discussion of basic political and
<br>
social values which all too often is dominated by people who are not,
<br>
perhaps, the best spokespeople for the ideas and values they hold.  This
<br>
ends up producing a clash of fairly shallow, iconic verbal behavior that
<br>
decays into name-calling and hostility.  Meanwhile, those who might be
<br>
inclined to a more peaceful and in-depth discussion are put off by the sound
<br>
and fury of ideological posturing.  Or, as E.Shaun pointed out, some of the
<br>
most articulate and reflective within our community are often simply too
<br>
busy with other work to take the time to write an in-depth response every
<br>
time someone raises a social or political question.  This unfortunately
<br>
leaves the field open to others who may not do as good a job of explaining
<br>
an extropian position on a particular issue.
<br>
<p>For the record, I've seen as much failure to engage in productive discussion
<br>
among the non-libertarians as in the vocal libertarians.  The value we place
<br>
on critical questioning of all forms of dogma seems just as lacking among
<br>
some of the more recent subscribers, who bring a more mainstream ideological
<br>
mind-set to this forum.  Of course, as a couple of people have pointed out
<br>
recently, it's much easier to see the other fellow's dogma for what it is
<br>
than to be aware of one's own basic and unquestioned assumptions.
<br>
<p>Now, finally, let me say that I personally hope that it isn't perceived I
<br>
lack empathy or sympathy for those less fortunate than myself.  One of the
<br>
primary reasons I call myself a transhumanist is that I have concluded that
<br>
the technologies we advocate offer real hope to the great mass of humans to
<br>
improve their lot.  One of the primary reasons I call myself an extropian is
<br>
that I have concluded that the values and ideals that make up extropianism
<br>
offer the best path for the great mass of humans to break out of the
<br>
deplorable cultural traps in which they live.  If I need to say this more
<br>
often and in more detail, I'll try to do so . . .  At any rate, I know these
<br>
sentiments are shared by the vast majority of people who call themselves
<br>
transhumanists and extropians, including those who have any claim to
<br>
&quot;leadership&quot; in this group.
