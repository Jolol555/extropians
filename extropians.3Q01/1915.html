<p>
Leonardo,
<br>
This is the standard sort of manufactured propaganda message these
<br>
groups post, fabricating much and exaggerating even more, writing in a
<br>
semantically inflammatory way. I've attended protests here in the US by
<br>
these groups and seen these posts afterward, claiming all sorts of
<br>
police atrocities that never happened. In instances where police got
<br>
physical, it was only after some of the most vicious and violent baiting
<br>
I have ever seen done. What would you do if you had 1000 people yelling
<br>
and screaming in your face, calling you all sorts of things, insulting
<br>
everything about you and your family and your profession, spitting and
<br>
throwing rotten food at you from a few feet away, and you had to sit
<br>
there and take it for hours on end???? Frankly, I'm disgusted with the
<br>
protesters, they deserve whatever the police throw at them, the way they
<br>
behave.
<br>
<p>The behavior of the protesters as I've described is INTENTIONAL, btw. It
<br>
is a standard tactic taught at protest boot camps like those run by the
<br>
Ruckus Society and other groups. Their entire purpose is to push the
<br>
police to the point where the police strike back in self defense and
<br>
frustration. Once one incident occurs, they then run rumors down the
<br>
line of women getting beaten, raped, etc etc etc.
<br>
<p>Similarly, the protest organizers pass around drugs to protesters that
<br>
are mood altering: pot with high THC and low CBD levels, mushrooms and
<br>
other hallucinogens. Use of these substances is well documented to be
<br>
effective as battle drugs (they were used against the British
<br>
successfully at a key battle against the Zulu in the 19th century,
<br>
wiping out a superior force with nothing but clubs and spears, and drug
<br>
crazed warriors). The use of these drugs helps to raise up the battle
<br>
fever among protesters.
