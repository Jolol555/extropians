<p>
An ever-popular topic is whether evolutionary adaptation alone can account
<br>
for aging. Maybe not:
<br>
<p>Caleb E. Finch, Ph.D., 
<br>
ARCO and William F. Kieschnick Chair 
<br>
in the Neurobiology of Aging and Director of the
<br>
Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC)
<br>
Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Research Center
<br>
University of Southern California
<br>
Los Angeles, California
<br>
<p>Under the direction of Prof. Finch, the ADRC has represented the combined
<br>
efforts
<br>
of investigators form USC, CalTech, UCLA, and other Los Angeles-area
<br>
institutions.
<br>
The Clinical Core of this Center seeks to provide a comprehensive and
<br>
accurate diagnosis 
<br>
for Alzheimer's patients that will follow the progression of the disease
<br>
over time, and provide  
<br>
an extensive information database for the cross-fertilization of
<br>
interdisciplinary research.  
<br>
The center also provides outreach and educational programs for awareness and 
<br>
understanding within the community.
<br>
<p>Every year since 1997, Prof. Finch has organized a symposium that he hopes
<br>
will give rise to 
<br>
a brand new line biological research -- the study of species that can live
<br>
to great ages with no 
<br>
apparent decrease in fertility or vitality.  Such unusual species, that
<br>
appear to exhibit &quot;negligible 
<br>
senescence,&quot; remain a treasure-trove of information that is hidden in their
<br>
cells and habitats
<br>
waiting to be revealed by the newest technologies of genomics, proteomics,
<br>
and gene expression
<br>
chips.
<br>
<p>This year's Fourth Annual Symposium on Organisms with Slow Aging (SOSA) was  
<br>
largest yet with more than 60 biologists sharing data about an enormous
<br>
array of species --
<br>
ranging from insects to turtles, from trees to rockfish, and from sea birds
<br>
to primates.  
<br>
The evolutionary theory of senescence is being seriously challenged by this
<br>
data because 
<br>
there are now so many examples of warm-blooded and cold-blooded vertebrates
<br>
that just 
<br>
don't fit the standard pattern of aging and senescence.  Ancient
<br>
bristlecone pines still produce 
<br>
as much pollen as young trees and have been assessed at over 4,000 years
<br>
old.  Female turtles 
<br>
over 65 and Rockfish older than 200 have been documented to produce eggs
<br>
that are as 
<br>
numerous and viable as those produced by young adults.  Among the
<br>
honeybees, worker bees 
<br>
and queen bees share the same genome, but the queen bee goes on to live
<br>
more than 20 
<br>
times longer than a typical worker (she is the only one who eats royal
<br>
jelly)?  The disparity 
<br>
is even more dramatic between worker termites and their queen.  
<br>
<p>This data provides evidence that  is completely contrary to the theory that
<br>
&quot;aging is inevitable.&quot;  
<br>
It is therefore quite a remarkable time in the history of gerontology.
<br>
Much of this information 
<br>
was not available to biological researchers even two years ago.  Until now,
<br>
the task of tracking 
<br>
down the data, seeking out their common threads, and placing them into a
<br>
larger puzzle was 
<br>
taken up by a few pioneering biologists such as Finch.  &quot;We know a lot
<br>
about fruit flies, 
<br>
microscopic worms, and white mice in the lab, but we know relatively little
<br>
about these other 
<br>
longer-lived organisms, especially those whose rates of aging are so slow
<br>
that it may even 
<br>
approach the point of being non-measurable,&quot; said Finch.  As a result of
<br>
Prof. Finch's efforts, 
<br>
the National Insitute of Aging (NIA) is considering the formation of a new
<br>
Program on the 
<br>
Comparative Biology of Aging.
