It appears as if Miriam English &lt;<a href="mailto:miriam@werple.net.au?Subject=Re:%20Enoughness,%20was%20Re:%20Vicious%20Racism&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108111520.RAA02978@color.sics.se&gt;">miriam@werple.net.au</a>&gt; wrote:

|Actually, I don't think it does follow logically. It may possibly be an 
<br>
|accidental (and maladaptive) result of the desire for a &quot;normal&quot; healthy 
<br>
|mate, but I don't think it *has* to come from that, and I doubt that we 
<br>
|could ever prove that it comes from one or another factor, so we can 
<br>
|speculate but never really come to a conclusion on this.
<br>
<p>I believe, based on the empirical track record of science, that scientists
<br>
will find out what, if any, mechanism control human behaviour, down to how
<br>
to treat various societal ills, like racism and nationalism.
<br>
<p>|The danger of associating it with evolution is that many people think that 
<br>
|evolution is an infallible mechanism for creating better and better 
<br>
|organisms. But that isn't so. Evolution is a grand game of roulette. 
<br>
|Sometimes good designs get wiped out by trivial accidents and bad designs 
<br>
|flourish. On the whole evolution works, but only in a blind, stumbling way.
<br>
<p>Teach them the scientific facts: Evolution Is A Mindless God.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;SNIP&lt;
</em><br>
<p>|But I kinda doubt that this selection mechanism is genetic though. I think 
<br>
|it is more likely to be social. I, with my anglo genes, am most attracted 
<br>
|to Indian and Asian features in women... so I don't think an evolutionary 
<br>
|explanation is really compelling.
<br>
<p>I believe in a more complicated mechanism.  A simple radio-button behaviour
<br>
does not ring true, considering the weird nets of control DNA tends to result
<br>
in.
<br>
<p>|&gt;Racism and wish for longevity form the sides of he same coin, one of them
<br>
|&gt;collectivistic (racism), the other individualistic (wish for longevity).
<br>
|&gt;
<br>
|&gt;I believe one could say the problem lies with collectivism, of which
<br>
|&gt;racism forms just a small part.
<br>
|
<br>
|Your point here eludes me completely, I'm sorry.
<br>
|I don't understand the connection you are trying to find between racism and 
<br>
|collectivism, or even the opposition between those two and individualism 
<br>
|and longevity.
<br>
<p>Racism is a meme complex, a belief system, which binds its believers into a
<br>
single borganism just like other collectivis memes. It even contains the
<br>
virulent &quot;Thou should distribute the truth to the unbelievers.&quot; and &quot;Beware
<br>
of the Evil Wrongdoers!&quot; memes.
<br>
<p>Point: Collectivism tends to turn off rational thinking.
