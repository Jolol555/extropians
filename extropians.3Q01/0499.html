<em>&gt; This brings me to a question to Max, or anyone else who knows the answer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Damien may also have some clues. Is there much, or any, formal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literature around that examines, defines and/or critiques
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism? I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean such things as articles in academic journals devoted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jurisprudence. I have some familiarity with relevant web sites and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considerable familiarity with popular books, fiction and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-fiction, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explore the ideas that comprise transhumanism - those are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I mean.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not aware of what (if any) more academic work would have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be read and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cited if someone wanted to write about transhumanism in an academic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical context - in the sense that one must be familiar with and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cite, say, Robert Nozick's work (and, say, G.A. Cohen's criticisms) if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing about libertarianism for an academic audience. Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an appropriate URL.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Knowing the answer to this might help me and some others on the list with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future projects.
</em><br>
<p>If no such thing exists -- and even if it does -- this sounds like a very
<br>
useful awareness raising project for someone with the connections to get
<br>
material into journal. The more of this that can be done, the better...
<br>
<p>...and that goes across the spectrum. I think that there's something to be
<br>
said for forming an extropian media committee, pooling resources, and
<br>
setting targets for rates of getting appropriately aimed articles into the
<br>
media. Nothing quite like friendly competition and setting of deadlines to
<br>
get things done faster.
<br>
<p>Of course, I'm biased on this front, given my aims ;) But really, guys and
<br>
girls, I don't think we don't have so much time that we can sit around and
<br>
let pro-tech, life extension and transhumanist movements grow at their own
<br>
rate. Hell, I've wasted five years in getting to my current philosophical
<br>
state since realizing that I *really* didn't want to die. Not good. That's
<br>
five years worth of motivated people giving up on greenpeace and starting to
<br>
learn pseudoeconomics and burning biotech experiments instead.
