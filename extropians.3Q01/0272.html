<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Without fire safety regs, large dense cities frequently had a huge

untold

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; installation of fire safety equipment (like extinguishers, fire
</em><br>
escapes,
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; smoke alarms, and public education).

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;I would hazard to guess -- but confess ignorance here:) -- that, in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;past, most fires, too were small and contained.  It wasn't like London
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;burned done once a decade.  You make it sound as if it did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;What we would need to do is find out if government fire codes have had
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;impact you believe they have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; When towns were built mainly of wood large fires were common (ie up to
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 17th century). They became much less frequent as other materials were
</em><br>
more
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; widely used. However this didn't require government fire regulation
</em><br>
codes,
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the same effect was achieved by insurers and by the use of restrictive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; covenants in building leases which stipulated that materials such as
</em><br>
brick
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or stone be used in any construction. (The insurers also had their own
</em><br>
fire
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; engine sevices, interestingly). So this was achieved by voluntary
</em><br>
agreement,
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; as you say.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, there is far more to building codes than just fire prevention:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;earthquake, flood, hurricane, as well as simple accident prevention. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;building and fire codes that your local governments institute are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conjured out of thin air. In fact, the original fire codes were, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fact, instituted by insurance company fire chiefs and building
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inspectors.
</em><br>
<p>That's what I said - the change in practice (which was indeed about more
<br>
than fire hazard) was produced by purely private action - the other key
<br>
groups are landlords and developers, hence the use of covenants long before
<br>
any code is adopted, local or otherwise.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Today, non governmental groups like the ICBO (International
<br>
<em>&gt;Conference of Building Officials), BOCA, etc meet regularly to refine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their codes, which are called 'model codes': they have no weight of law,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but insurance companies rely on them, and most all state, county, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;local governments base their own building and fire codes on these model
</em><br>
<em>&gt;codes, revising their own codes every 4-12 years as the groups issue new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;versions with changes that have been debated and voted on by the members
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from all over the country and the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;These codes are not instituted by fiat, they are not promulgated out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thin air. They are typically studied with detailed scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experiments, with reports issued and significant peer review done before
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conclusions are drawn and proposed code changes are written based upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the newest research.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Indeed, in fact this happens much more widely. The commercial codes of most
<br>
states of the US have been largely drawn up this way, as I understant it.
