<p>I have heard arguments from those who wish to remain anonymous,

but my take is the opposite.  Everyone should be open and findable.

Here I stand, world!  That way, under the conditions of political
<br>
instability, few have the option of fleeing or hiding, and so they have

all the more motivation to STAND AND FIGHT for freedom.

Honest to god, freedom is something that really is worth fighting for.

Stand tall and STAND YOUR GROUND,  those who love

freedom, dont hide, FIGHT!  We are many, we will win!  spike
