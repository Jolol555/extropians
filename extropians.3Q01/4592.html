<em>&gt; &gt; Considering your earlier predeliction toward judging the information by

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; luddite website that, according to my browsing, embraces all sorts of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good question.  The source in this case is a London newspaper.  The reporter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seemed to report the news based on interviews.  There is no evidence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God told him how to rewrite the story to make it conform to the author's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious beliefs.  Therefore this article seems to be a more reliable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source than some previous articles.
</em><br>
<p>While the column (I can scarcely call it an article, since its content
<br>
is far more a matter of opinion, spin, and hyperbole) is published by
<br>
the Guardian, the website it is on is most certainly NOT the Guardian,
<br>
it is a website which is illegally using copyrighted material. Below are
<br>
its claims to use:

<br>
<p>So, Harvey, this is much like your complaints about the prior column on
<br>
race that happened to be hosted on a religious/supremacist sort of
<br>
website, but did not originate there....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not necessarily true. What Monsanto is saying is that genetic markers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the GMO crop is being found elsewhere on land not seeded with GMO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plants. They are not testing crops, they are testing the dirt, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; collects pollen from many sources.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't find this in the article.  Can you point to where it says this?
</em><br>
<p>In glancing through this:
<br>
&quot;In April, a Canadian farmer called Percy Schmeiser was forced to pay
<br>
Monsanto $85,000, after a court ruled that  he had stolen Monsanto's
<br>
genetic material. Schmeiser maintained that the thinly- spread  GM rape
<br>
plants on his farm were the result of pollen contamination from his
<br>
neighbor's  fields, and he had done all he could to get rid of them. But
<br>
Monsanto's proprietary genes  had been found on his land whether he
<br>
wanted them or not.&quot;
<br>
<p>I must have subconciously taken the 'on his land' literally.... Argh.
<br>
<p>What is the alleged advantage of the GM rape plants?
