It appears as if Barbara Lamar &lt;<a href="mailto:altamiratexas@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Transparency%20Rant%20(was%20Re:%20Enoughness,%20was%20Re:%20Vicious%20Racism)&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108161158.NAA27056@color.sics.se&gt;">altamiratexas@earthlink.net</a>&gt; wrote:

|&gt; I have, since I read John Brunner's &quot;The Shockwave Rider&quot; (ISBN
<br>
|&gt; 0-345-32431-5)
<br>
|&gt; made sure that my data shadow does not look like me:
<br>

<br>
|Some of the things you list, such as not having bank accounts or credit
<br>
|cards, not using ID cards, are inconvenient.
<br>
<p>I found it inconvenient in the beginning, too, but one learns with time to
<br>
care more about one's freedom than one's convenience.
<br>
<p>|The only reason I can think of not to allow oneself into various databases
<br>
|is that one might someday need to hide from someone who has access to such
<br>
|databases. But maybe there are other reasons I'm missing.
<br>
<p>My reason is a very simple one: I don't like to live in a prison.
<br>
<p>|If one wishes to maintain a degree of anonymity to leave open the option of
<br>
|hiding, it would seem to make more sense to develop one or more alternative
<br>
|identities one could step into if the need should arise. Refusing to produce
<br>
|ID cards, insisting on using cash for large purchases and so forth draw
<br>
|attention to a person rather than protecting their anonymity.
<br>
<p>If I did that, I certainly would not make it public in a public medium as
<br>
the Extropians Mailing List.
<br>
<p>|People I've known who've experienced life under conditions of political
<br>
|instability say it's wise to have passports from at least two nation-states.
<br>
<p>I have found political stability to be as much a pain, myself.
