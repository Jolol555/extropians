</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;universal purposes, in my opinion is the next level of integration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;for someone. That is what being filled with the divine is about...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems of course more reasonable to phrase factual claims in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning things from your unconscious, rather than from nature. But it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worries me when you talk about truth being less important, about requiring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deep trust, and concluding that your personal path is beneficial to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world.  I fear that your unconscious may be telling you comforting lies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It depends very much on what you mean by &quot;truth&quot;.  There are
<br>
truths that are really amenable to reason, logic and the
<br>
scientific method. Truths about the material universe.  There
<br>
are other truths about people and consciousness and lifes and
<br>
visions of what can be that are not so easy to touch with those
<br>
tools but they are crucially important also.  The first truth is
<br>
not less important necessarily but it is certainly not more
<br>
important than the second type of truth. There are other levels
<br>
of truth I believe but we will start with this.
<br>
<p><p>What was said about trusting the messages from the deep self, or
<br>
at any rate from beyond the range of the self-aware, conscious
<br>
intellectual mind is both very true and very difficult to learn
<br>
and to apply gracefully and in balance with the intellect.  
<br>
<p>Sychronizing the personal with the global is very much part of
<br>
being fully plugged in to one's life and time.  Without that
<br>
synchronization we are all just islands of me-ness flooding on
<br>
the river of history waiting for the Singularity or death.  
<br>
<p>We can be, if you will, tools of what is to come, acting in its
<br>
materialization, shaping it and being shaped by it even until we
<br>
experience our lives as It manifesting us.  This requires the
<br>
level of integration talked about above.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; You see, it seems that humans are not built to be truth-seekers, and so are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often happier, etc. when they allow other considerations to influence their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs.  People like to think they are more able than they are, for example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humans are built to be truth-seekers more in some areas than in others,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but in all areas must rely enormously on unconscious mental processing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the areas where people seek truth more, they are conscious of critical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes that check claims for various sorts of reasonableness.  In the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other areas, we tend to distract or disable these critical processes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to allow non-truth considerations to better influence beliefs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the essence of self-deception.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Believing that what is good for me is good for the world is exactly one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of those areas where we should expect people to be self-deceived. 
</em><br>
<p>Don't all of us here do precisely that?  We all believe that
<br>
augmenting ourselves and running technology all out to reach the
<br>
Singularity is good for us and for the world.  We believe it
<br>
regardless of what most of the world has to say.  We believe it
<br>
even though it is a meta-claim not at all verifiable by our
<br>
blessed rationality.  Actually, some of us seem to believe an
<br>
even stranger thing.  Some believe that the world and its people
<br>
can go jump and are relatively unimportant as long as a
<br>
hyper-intelligence is born out of this world.  If it turns and
<br>
eats us or otherwise destroys us then that is nothing to them. 
<br>
Now that is a level of belief and of space for self-deception
<br>
far beyond what might be involved in noting and being impressed
<br>
by synchronicities!
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt; If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the part of you that seems to claim this also seems to tell you that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must trust it without doubt or criticism, and that truth isn't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so important a goal, this seems a good candidate for self-deception.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I grant that you will probably be happier if you let yourself be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-deceived in such a way.  But perhaps you would rather be less happy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and believe truer things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I believe you are reading a lot into what was said that was
<br>
never said.  For me, that which draws me, that dream of a future
<br>
and how to get there with the most joy at every point along the
<br>
way, is certainly not about only &quot;trust it without doubt or
<br>
criticism&quot;.  Without all my years of doubt and continuing doubt
<br>
and without criticisms I could neither appreciate the
<br>
possibilities or emphasize with others with just as many doubts
<br>
or begin to find a way to proceed even with all the doubts and
<br>
criticism.  Doubts are part of the process.  There is no make
<br>
believe here.  It is deeply real and messy and wonderful.  
<br>
<p>But it is no cakewalk, no rose-colored glasses.  It is nothing
<br>
at all like you seem to believe it is.
