Hello everyone,
<br>
<p>I thought I would share with the list what kind of science instruction to the general public is available up here.  I have attended some of the presentations in past years and really enjoyed it.  What topics or speakers here should I not miss at any cost?
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
<br>
