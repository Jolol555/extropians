<em>&gt; Olga writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ...I pasted in something from Natasha's recent post:  &quot;At first,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only those with money or connections had them.  Today, in downtown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Los Angeles, there are more Mexicans using cell phones than executives.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What was the implication in that sentence?  That once upon a time when
</em><br>
cell &gt; &gt; phones were expensive they had a certain cachet as only rich
<br>
hoity-toity
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; CEOs could get their hands on them; but now these formerly exclusive
</em><br>
handy &gt; &gt; little gadgets have become so cheap and plentiful that &quot;Mexicans&quot;
<br>
have
<br>
them &gt; &gt; (Mexicans in this case standing for a catch-all word meaning
<br>
what? --
<br>
poor &gt; &gt; people? riff-raff? the hoi-polloi? illegal aliens?). [YOUR
<br>
IMPLICATIONS,
<br>
<em>&gt; not hers]
</em><br>
<p>Note the question marks.  I neither said the implications were Natasha's -
<br>
nor mine.  I was asking how they may be perceived by the general reader (and
<br>
I suggested a few ways they may be perceived).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, I think that there *is* an implication in that sentence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mexicans are poorer than business executives, and are poorer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than some other ethnic groups.  But Olga---this is a fact!
</em><br>
<p>Thank you, Harvey Newstrom, for saying exactly what I would have said to
<br>
this.  To reiterate, don't think it is helpful to use the term &quot;Mexicans&quot; in
<br>
such an instance - and I suggested a more accurate description may have been
<br>
&quot;poor people&quot; or something ...
<br>
<p>If &gt; I imagine that some small enclave of people of my racial persuasion
<br>
<em>&gt; were to have to flee to Japan, and for *whatever* reason were poorer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the Japanese, I would not be offended by such a sentence.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentence would only be alluding to a fact (or a widely-assumed fact).
</em><br>
<p>If there were no other people of your racial persuation in Japan other than
<br>
&quot;poor,&quot; this would work.  Otherwise, this example would have the same
<br>
problem of fallacy as the aforementioned one.  Being or not being offended
<br>
is a whole other subject which I did not bring up in my post.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The huge mistake that the left has made is this:  people are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only supposed to not allude to certain facts, but worse, they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not even supposed to *recognize* certain realities.
</em><br>
<p>There's nothing I like more than facts.  But give me facts.  People on the
<br>
right don't have a monopoly on recognizing realities, in any case.  Neither
<br>
do people on the left.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a little
<br>
<em>&gt; bit like thought-crime.  This puts a fiendish burden on everyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves included!  As we discussed before, any normally functioning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human being constantly generalizes; it's part of how one's nervous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system works, and if it didn't, we'd never have evolved to where we are.
</em><br>
<p>I will defend your right to say anything you like.  I only point out there
<br>
are consequences to some of our actions.  A particular consequence may
<br>
inspire a change in behavior, if that consequence is judged worthy of
<br>
modification.  Humans beings have the capacity to become more educated,
<br>
insightful, mature all their lives, in spite of how their nervous system
<br>
works.  It depends on what is important to you, personally (i.e., I am not
<br>
proposing that everyone will come to exactly the same conclusions as to what
<br>
constitutes education, insightfulness, maturity).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you happened to live in a country where those people who were dressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a certain way, or had some other distinguishing characteristic, were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more likely to harm you than others, you *could* *not* *help* but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notice.  To then pound yourself with criticism over your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stereotyping reminds me of nothing so much as Orwell's 1984.  Out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of sheer ideology---or because the party says so---facts are denied,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought is controlled.
</em><br>
<p>More likely to harm you?  While this subject has validity, it is a bit out
<br>
of the range of what we were discussing here.  I am not a person who
<br>
believes in things out of sheer ideology, in any case.  I wonder why I may
<br>
have given you that impression, if you are imputing some of the above to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Which is it you want?  For Natasha to not have such thoughts, i.e.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exercise such mental agility that thought-crime is impossible, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely for her never to *say* what she is thinking?  And if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; latter, then how do you think that she is going to *feel* about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her evil thoughts?  The Christians make it even a sin to lust,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so they're screwed, because humans will always lust, and it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same thing here.  (What should have been a sin is to *act*.)
</em><br>
<p>Again, we're back to thought crimes -- and I'm not sure what that's all
<br>
about.  Natasha is a smart lady, and will come to her own conclusions.  I
<br>
have a feeling Natasha is somewhat like me - she will &quot;never graduate&quot;
<br>
(i.e., keep evolving and learning).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm starting to think that you'd be happy with the Chinese self-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticism sessions that were on-going for a couple of decades.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Every week *everyone* would join a self-criticism group, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confess their bourgeois tendencies and lack of focus and failure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to more steadfastly incorporate Mao ZheDong thought.  Just think:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we had those here, then each week you could go confess the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way that you yourself had been unconsciously noticing patterns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and stereotyping.  Wouldn't that be great?
</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your political correctness even reached fever pitch when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysed Brian's perfectly innocent observation about Mexicans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (You even admitted that there were no implications at all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlike Natasha's transgression.)  What had Brian failed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do right?  I'll tell you!  He didn't qualify his sentence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the Mexicans with newspeak.  I mean, he didn't qualify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his sentence with indicators showing solidarity with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; masses.  Oops. Wrong country again.  I mean, he didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualify his sentence with politically correct panderings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to progressive forces, i.e., he could have said &quot;Latinos&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or he could have thrown in a phrase about exploitation, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something.  But he didn't, and you were on him in a flash.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I was asking a question.  Brian answered my question.  The background
<br>
of this for me was that this issue was percolating on a back burner since
<br>
Natasha's post at the end of July - and please observe I wasn't &quot;on [her]
<br>
like a flash&quot; (what you attributed to me in Brian's case).  It may have
<br>
seemed like I was on Brian &quot;like a flash,&quot; but the truth is that his post
<br>
brought up Natasha's (from the back burner), and so I thought maybe I would
<br>
address it.  I even thought it may do some good to explore this issue.
<br>
Maybe I was wrong.
