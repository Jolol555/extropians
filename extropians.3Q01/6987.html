<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senate OKs FBI Net Spying
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Declan McCullagh

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON -- FBI agents soon may be able to spy on Internet users
<br>
legally without a court order.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thursday evening, two days after the worst terrorist attack in U.S.
<br>
history, the Senate approved the &quot;Combating Terrorism Act of 2001,&quot; which
<br>
enhances police wiretap powers and permits monitoring in more situations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-Attack Feds Push Carnivore
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody's got issues in Politics
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep an eye on Privacy Matters
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress Mulls Stiff Crypto Laws
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measure, proposed by Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Dianne
<br>
Feinstein (D-California), says any U.S. attorney or state attorney general
<br>
can order the installation of the FBI's Carnivore surveillance system.
<br>
Previously, there were stiffer restrictions on Carnivore and other Internet
<br>
surveillance techniques.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its bipartisan sponsors argue that such laws are necessary to
<br>
thwart terrorism. &quot;It is essential that we give our law enforcement
<br>
authorities every possible tool to search out and bring to justice those
<br>
individuals who have brought such indiscriminate death into our backyard,&quot;
<br>
Hatch said during the debate on the Senate floor.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday's vote comes as the nation's capital is reeling from
<br>
the catastrophes at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and politicians
<br>
are vowing to do whatever is necessary to preserve the safety of Americans.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, Sen. Judd Gregg (R-New Hampshire) called for
<br>
restrictions on privacy-protecting encryption products, and Carnivore's use
<br>
appears on the rise. In England, government officials have asked phone
<br>
companies and Internet providers to collect and record all their users'
<br>
communications -- in case the massive accumulation of data might yield clues
<br>
about Tuesday's terrorist attacks.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Combating Terrorism Act, prosecutors could authorize
<br>
surveillance for 48-hour periods without a judge's approval.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warrantless surveillance appears to be limited to the addresses
<br>
of websites visited, the names and addresses of e-mail correspondents, and
<br>
so on, and is not intended to include the contents of communications. But
<br>
the legislation would cover URLs, which include information such as what Web
<br>
pages you're visiting and what terms you type in when visiting search
<br>
engines.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumstances that don't require court orders include an
<br>
&quot;immediate threat to the national security interests of the United States,
<br>
(an) immediate threat to public health or safety or an attack on the
<br>
integrity or availability of a protected computer.&quot; That covers most
<br>
computer hacking offenses.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Thursday's floor debate, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont),
<br>
head of the Judiciary committee, suggested that the bill went far beyond
<br>
merely thwarting terrorism and could endanger Americans' privacy. He also
<br>
said he had a chance to read the Combating Terrorism Act just 30 minutes
<br>
before the floor debate began.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe the Senate wants to just go ahead and adopt new abilities
<br>
to wiretap our citizens,&quot; Leahy said. &quot;Maybe they want to adopt new
<br>
abilities to go into people's computers. Maybe that will make us feel safer.
<br>
Maybe. And maybe what the terrorists have done made us a little bit less
<br>
safe. Maybe they have increased Big Brother in this country.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By voice vote, the Senate attached the Combating Terrorism Act
<br>
to an annual spending bill that funds the Commerce, Justice and State
<br>
departments for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, then unanimously approved
<br>
it. Since the House has not reviewed this version of the appropriations
<br>
bill, a conference committee will be created to work out the differences.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Arizona), one of the co-sponsors, said the
<br>
Combating Terrorism Act would give former FBI Director Louis Freeh what he
<br>
had lobbied for years ago: &quot;These are the kinds of things that law
<br>
enforcement has asked us for. This combination is relatively modest in
<br>
comparison with the kind of terrorist attack we have just suffered.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Experts in terrorism have been telling us for a long time and
<br>
the director of the FBI has been telling us (to make) a few changes in the
<br>
law that make it easier for our law enforcement people to do their job,&quot; Kyl
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's unclear what day-to-day effects the Combating Terrorism Act
<br>
would have on prosecutors and Internet users. Some Carnivore installations
<br>
apparently already take place under emergency wiretap authority, and some
<br>
civil liberties experts say part of this measure would give that practice
<br>
stronger legal footing.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One of the key issues that have surrounded the use of Carnivore
<br>
is being addressed by the Senate in a late-night session during a national
<br>
emergency,&quot; says David Sobel, general counsel of the Electronic Privacy
<br>
Information Center.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A source close to the Senate Judiciary committee pointed out
<br>
that the wording of the Combating Terrorism Act is so loose -- the
<br>
no-court-order-required language covers &quot;routing&quot; and &quot;addressing&quot; data --
<br>
that it's unclear what its drafters intended. The Justice Department had
<br>
requested similar legislation last year.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nobody really knows what routing and addressing information
<br>
is.... If you're putting in addressing information and routing information,
<br>
you may not just get (From: lines of e-mail messages), you might also get
<br>
content,&quot; the source said.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Combating Terrorism Act also expands the list of criminal
<br>
offenses for which traditional, court-ordered wiretaps can be sought to
<br>
explicitly include terrorism and computer hacking.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other portions include assessing how prepared the National Guard
<br>
is to respond to weapons of mass destruction, handing the CIA more
<br>
flexibility in recruiting informants and improving the storage of U.S.
<br>
&quot;biological pathogens.&quot;
