<p><em>&gt; MIT is in the process of putting the contents of almost all their classes onto 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the net.  I think this is a wonderful thing so people can not only explore the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topics, but &quot;wade in&quot; and see if they might ever handle the subject.
</em><br>
<p>I've got an even better idea!  We all know that education is the key.
<br>
We should forthwith open up in every city in America a number of 
<br>
places where people can come in and read almost any book for FREE.
<br>
Not only that, but after proper licensing, they might take any of
<br>
the materials home, and study to their hearts' content.  While perhaps
<br>
it wouldn't be appropriate to fund this at the national level, I very
<br>
much favor local municipalities getting behind this idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One thing to remember though, even having all this knowledge online, or even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offering free classes may not be enough.  As discussed here earlier, some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people just do not have the intellectual power to do &quot;top ten list&quot; jobs in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information age.  Which is not to say they could at least fulfill whatever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited potential they have.
</em><br>
<p>Education is all that the under class needs!  If each person were to
<br>
take full advantage of what would be available under my proposal,
<br>
poverty and ignorance would be greatly reduced.
