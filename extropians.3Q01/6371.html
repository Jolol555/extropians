<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;I'd like to add some ideas from here, down south.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;There's an important point in Nikos speech which appears to have been
</em><br>
<em> &gt;neglected: the power of press, specifically the power of CNN.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;All around the world we are subjected to 3 or 4 huge news distributors,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;and one of them - as you well know - is CNN. Very well, I guess all of
</em><br>
<em> &gt;you have been seeing (just as I've been) images from this company. In
</em><br>
<em> &gt;particular, one set of images called my attencion: the Palestinians
</em><br>
<em> &gt;celebrating the bombing, out on the streets, eating some cake and making
</em><br>
<em> &gt;funny faces for the camera.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;Well, THOSE IMAGES WERE SHOT BACK IN 1991!!! Those are images of
</em><br>
<em> &gt;Palestinians celebrating the invasion of Kuwait! It's simply
</em><br>
<em> &gt;unacceptable that a super-power of cumminications as CNN uses images
</em><br>
<em> &gt;which do not correspond to the reality in talking about so serious an
</em><br>
<em> &gt;issue.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;A teacher of mine, here in Brazil, has videotapes recorded in 1991, with
</em><br>
<em> &gt;the very same images; he's been sending emails to CNN, Globo (the major
</em><br>
<em> &gt;TV network in Brazil) and newspapers, denouncing what I myself classify
</em><br>
<em> &gt;as a crime against the public opinion. If anyone of you has access to
</em><br>
<em> &gt;this kind of files, serch for it. In the meanwhile, I'll try to 'put my
</em><br>
<em> &gt;hands' on a copy of this tape.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;But now, think for a moment about the impact of such images. Your people
</em><br>
<em> &gt;is hurt, emotionally fragile, and this kind broadcast have very high
</em><br>
<em> &gt;possibility of causing waves of anger and rage against Palestinians.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;It's simply irresponsible to show images such as those.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;Finally, I'd like to say that we all regret and condemn all that has
</em><br>
<em> &gt;happened in the last days; but Nikos has a point here. I really don't
</em><br>
<em> &gt;want to be misunderstood here, but the truth is that US government had
</em><br>
<em> &gt;shown no respect for other countries in the last decades. In the 60s and
</em><br>
<em> &gt;70s they had halped lots of military coups throughout the world
</em><br>
<em> &gt;(including Brazil in 64). Later, with Reagan and Bush Father, the
</em><br>
<em> &gt;Washington Consensus have been demolishing the bases of our economies,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;making us more and more dependant (and, many of us, prehocupied with
</em><br>
<em> &gt;this situation).
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;Your current president quickly made things worse: Kioto Protocol, Star
</em><br>
<em> &gt;Wars, Colombia Plan, the exchange of rain forest for pieces of external
</em><br>
<em> &gt;debt, tha abandonment of the position of third party in negotiations
</em><br>
<em> &gt;between IRA and England, and between Palestinians and Israel. All those
</em><br>
<em> &gt;mistakes in US external politics made your country more hatred than
</em><br>
<em> &gt;before, and, of course, more vulnerable.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;Listen, I'm NOT justifying the terrorist actions that took place in your
</em><br>
<em> &gt;country; but it seems to me that, if your leaders had come along another
</em><br>
<em> &gt;path of thoughts and actions, you wouldn't be suffering what you are
</em><br>
<em> &gt;now.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;Best regards, and the hope that everything is resolved for the best of
</em><br>
<em> &gt;all of us
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
