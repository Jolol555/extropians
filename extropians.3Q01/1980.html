<p>Is your very good friend willing to share his email with us so that we can
<br>
cross-examine him (or her; I'll assume him) directly?  Let's take a
<br>
specific example:  Did he see, with his own eyes, Bush drinking wine on a
<br>
cruise ship?  Or is he reporting the slogan that somebody else shouted? 
<br>
Did he personally see police deliberately running over people with cars? 
<br>
Or did he hear it from some other protestor and then go on to help spread
<br>
the rumor?  Was he personally sprayed with tear gas, and if so, what was
<br>
he doing at the time?  As far as I can see, this email is a report of the
<br>
rumors propagating through the protesters.  And, since I know that this
<br>
was not an angry mob of scientists, my guess is that it would have been
<br>
socially unacceptable for someone in the audience to stand up and shout &quot;I
<br>
haven't seen anyone hit by tear gas&quot; or &quot;I find it really hard to believe
<br>
that the police car would run over the body&quot; - and most of the people in
<br>
the mob simply wouldn't think that way.
<br>
<p>No, it's not a propaganda message from some group fabricating and
<br>
exaggerating events; it's a completely uncritical report of the rumors
<br>
passing through the crowd.  These rumors might have been generated by
<br>
emergent memetic forces and they might have been generated by deliberate
<br>
propaganda, but either way, the report doesn't tell us anything whatsoever
<br>
until we know what your very good friend *personally* witnessed.
