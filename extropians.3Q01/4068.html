<em>&gt;From: &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20GOP%20standards%20were%20higher%20than%20DEM%20standards&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108131526.IAA27591@well.com&gt;">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Not to disagree with you, but the answer is simple.  Republicans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and Democrats agree that yelling &quot;fire&quot; in a theater should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outlawed, so they pass legislation to outlaw it.  They do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agree that the media biases elections, so there is not enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consensus to pass a law on this.  You may think both examples are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equally obvious, but not all lawmakers would agree. Hence, no law.
</em><br>
<p>Why would the Democrats seek to interfere in the media when it is
<br>
heavily biased in their favor? That is the reason in my opinion,
<br>
not that they don't see a problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would have thought that events of the last election would prompt
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lawmakers to block media polling of elections.  However, Democrats
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't believe in the bias of the media.  Republicans don't believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in more government regulation.  The media put on a big campaign to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-regulate so that the laws weren't needed.  In the end, nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wanted to pass these laws.
</em><br>
<p>I respectfully disagree again.
<br>
<p>The media is heavily biased to favor Democrats. I agree with Mike
<br>
on this. There should be a law that prohibits the media from
<br>
talking about the election until after the polls are closed.
