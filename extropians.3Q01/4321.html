<p><em>&gt;You're completely right Brian, a good book on the body since greek
</em><br>
<em>&gt;times has been written by Anthony Synott, called The Body Social,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It charts various themes of the body like dualism, body as self,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;body as sin, body as machine and back again to body as self. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reason I didn't go back to the greeks in that message is because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm looking more directly at the modern self in the context of new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technologies, and furthermore related to both sexes. Although I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not up on my greek and roman history, I believe much of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fascination in the body was male orientated, though there were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obvious exceptions. I think female bodies have gone through more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;severe changes in conception than male bodies, particulrly in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;15 to 18th century - even later, where the female body was seen as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the site of transgression, evil sexuality, wondering wombs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;temptation, witchlike and devious. Where as the male body has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;largely been seen as atheletic, strong, dominant....o.k. perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;female bodies have also been seen as beautiful - usually by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;artists. But the medical profession have certainly given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;female body a hard time. Anyway, the reason I chose to begin later
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than the greeks was because not till the last couple of centuries
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have both females and males ben able to enhance their appearance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and bodily functions, and not since the last 40 or so years have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they been able to do it through technology. (Give or take those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who has the money to take potions and lotions before this)
</em><br>
<p>I may have missed your previous posts, I receive the list as ASCII
<br>
text and your html laden posts are difficult to read without
<br>
conversion, unless something interesting catches my eye I don't
<br>
usually bother.
<br>
<p>While women through the ages have been subject to the whims of men,
<br>
there were notable exceptions, including Hypatia. An interesting
<br>
idea for your paper might be the subject of female body builders.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But yes, you're right and I think I may have to revise the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;historical part of my paper to include the greek body and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;platonian mind. Thanks
</em><br>
<p>I just wanted to point out that for many of us, the original idea
<br>
came from ancient texts rather than modern media.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Is it obsessive to want to better yourself? 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I hate to say it but 'obsession' is a subjective idea, and one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;man rationality is another man's irrationality!, but yes, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obsession is the wrong word, maybe 'concern' of the body and mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be a better phrase? What do you suggest?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we are very concerned, focused is also a good word.
<br>
<p>Part of the problem is that we are not yet at the stage of
<br>
technology where the things we really need are available.
<br>
Being pragmatists, we need to focus on extending our current
<br>
lifespans and health for as long as possible. Our explorations to
<br>
date have yielded information on human health that is generally
<br>
more advanced than that possessed by many people.
<br>
<p>It is widely considered for example that the human body needs 30
<br>
minutes a day of exercise as a minimum requirement to stay healthy.
<br>
How many people do you know that accomplish this?
<br>
<p>Once you begin a program of exercise and begin to reap it's
<br>
benefits it's a simple extension to add a bit more for optimal
<br>
health. Many of us find from personnal experience that we think
<br>
better at this stage as well, plus we are less of a burden on an
<br>
overworked healthcare system. Naturally we share results/ideas with
<br>
the list.
<br>
<p>The Ancients were right.
