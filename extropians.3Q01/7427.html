Dear Extropes,
<br>
<p>Are you OK?
<br>
<p>So then, checking in, after being away during these last two
<br>
weeks. I was in the Canary Islands with my bicycle, exploring
<br>
Tenerife's coastal perimeter and El Teide volcano.
<br>
<p>Even on that island, the news was big. If I wasn't told the news (*),
<br>
I would have found out anyway- the flags in the larger towns on Tenerife
<br>
were flying half-mast, and I would asked questions about that, for sure.
<br>
<p>I want to say that I'm very sorry for those of you who lost someone
<br>
in that tragedy, and for all of the sorrow that you must have felt
<br>
(and no doubt, still feel) during these last two weeks. It still makes
<br>
me sick to think about it.

<p>(*) A stranger with a Spanish newspaper I met in a little coastal town's
<br>
cafe. He didn't understand Spanish either, but showed me his newspaper
<br>
nevertheless. At first, I thought that the Spanish newspaper was a
<br>
sick parody of a  US supermarket tabloid talking about a blockbuster
<br>
movie. I couldn't believe my eyes. It's been a surreal two weeks.
