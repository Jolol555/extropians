<p>None whatsoever.  Martin Luther King handled 90% of the problem.  Almost
<br>
all of the remainder will be wiped out by the Singularity.  Even ignoring
<br>
the Singularity factor, we're currently seen politically driven
<br>
overcompensations striving against politically driven backlashes, at which
<br>
point effort is worse than nothing and it's time to shut up and ignore the
<br>
problem out of existence.  Paying attention is only exacerbating the
<br>
continued perception of humanity as divided into groups by skin color. 
<br>
The glowing promise of the future consists of the next generation growing
<br>
up not knowing that racism ever existed until they reach high school,
<br>
followed by the Starbellied Sneech Scenario once the requisite level of
<br>
bodily modification becomes possible.
<br>
<p>And if discussion were necessary, it doesn't need to happen on
<br>
Extropians!  We're talking about infusing the body with respirocytes and
<br>
growing extra pairs of arms, not to mention transcending Homo sapiens the
<br>
species; it is BENEATH us to notice someone's skin color even for the sake
<br>
of discussing why we don't care about it!  We are finished!  Over!  Done
<br>
with!  We've walked over the hills and under the seas so far beyond the
<br>
realm where skin color is noticeable that it is backsliding even to notice
<br>
that we're not noticing it!
<br>
<p>So kill the thread and talk about Matrioshka Brains for a change, before
<br>
we get so far off-topic that the Powers couldn't find us with a radio
<br>
telescope.
