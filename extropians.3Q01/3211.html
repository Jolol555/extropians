<em>&gt; &gt;In our society, this happens too often and we find bloodbaths, brutal

<em>&gt; &gt;violence, and warfare occurring around the world when conflicts spiral out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of control. We can also find censorship, pretensions of a harmonious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;society and ambiguous doubletalk statements like &quot;everything has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;correct point in accordance to their perspective&quot; when people attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;minimize conflict and impose their way.

<em>&gt; &gt;You may wonder what if we all think rationally even when starting with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;irrational beliefs. In such a case, we will actively seek viewpoints
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;contrary to our own to minimize guilt (of learning about the truth too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;late) and in our quest for a more accurate personal theory about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;universe. Eventually, through the free exchange of incompatible views and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;from our seeking of more knowledge, we will come across a theory that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;satisfies all the logical prerequisites. Since this theory and our other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;theories will mutually exclude each other, so we can only believe in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;theory and only this theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think this theory is highly questionable.  We do not just look
<br>
for what satisfies all logical prerequisites.  We are not
<br>
Vulcans or logic machines.  It is very highly doubtful that the
<br>
multiplicity of viewpoints towards life and universe all reduce
<br>
to such a single core that there can be one right answer, with
<br>
only those in agreement with that answer and fully accepting it
<br>
being &quot;rational&quot;.  It is also false that theories of meaning and
<br>
signficance especially mutually exclude each other.
<br>
<p>Given the shakiness of the premise, all conclusions from it are
<br>
unlikely to be valid and certainly are unlikely to be universal
<br>
truths to be applied to the larger problem of societies in
<br>
general.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Hence, in a society with even one irrational member, we have to exercise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;censorship to prevent conflicts from occurring, or we will have to live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;outside each other's influence. However, in a society with only rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;members, we will eventually come to a common consensus while enjoying free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;speech. Hence, the paradox shows itself.
</em><br>
<p>Bad premises lead to erroneous conclusions.  There is no reason
<br>
to believe that all rational people will come to a common
<br>
consensus about a great many things.
