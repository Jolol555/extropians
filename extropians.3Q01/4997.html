My comments on this article:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;<a href="http://www.techreview.com/magazine/sep01/reviews.asp">http://www.techreview.com/magazine/sep01/reviews.asp</a>
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The United States by any conceivable measure has the finest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientists in the world. But the rest of the population, by any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rational standard, is abysmally ignorant of science, mathematics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all things technical.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but I'm not sure the U.S. is alone, in this respect.
<br>
(still observing, from this side of the Atlantic)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In the next century, we will need to be able to deal confidently with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technical issues, and a responsible electorate will need to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some reasonable mastery of how the world works.
</em><br>
<p>rather than &quot;mastery&quot;, I would use &quot;understanding&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In these circumstances, an undergraduate major in science should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the best possible preparation for any serious profession. Or, put
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another way, the science major today should be what classical Greek
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and Latin were in the 19th century, and the liberal-arts major was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the 20th:
</em><br>
<p>I find this statement odd. The Classical education is from where the
<br>
scientific critical thinking skills are derived. Scientists today
<br>
acquired them, not from anyone/anything recent, but from the Greeks
<br>
two thousand years ago. Starting with the classics gives basic
<br>
preparation for *anyone* today, entering *any* serious profession.
<br>
Focusing on the sciences comes after that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;the union card required to enter the professional world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Unfortunately, the science education we have in place to provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this union card could not be less suited to the task.
</em><br>
<p>which professional world? A PhD in a scientific field is the &quot;union
<br>
card&quot; for professional scientists, a BS and a MS in a sciences will
<br>
get you somewhere.  At the very least, the Classics can give you the
<br>
critical thinking skills (among many areas) to help you learn
<br>
technical concepts on your own.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Science education in the United States today exists as a kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mining and sorting operation, in which we, the existing scientists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cull through what comes our way, searching for diamonds in the rough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that can be cleaned and cut and polished into glittering gems just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like us.
</em><br>
<p>Also true in Europe
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And, it is said, many people major in elementary education for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;precisely that reason. Our elementary school teachers are therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not only ignorant of science; they are hostile to science. That
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hostility must, inevitably, rub off on the young people they teach.
</em><br>
<p>If this true, then it's very sad
<br>
<p>(this was not true of my experience, and I attended 6 elementary
<br>
schools in 3 different U.S. states. Perhaps things have changed from
<br>
35 years ago.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A few years ago, I was on a committee to look into how well the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;breadth&quot; requirement-that all students take at least one course in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;science-was working at one University of California campus.
</em><br>
<p>The University of California campuses is where I had my worst
<br>
educational experiences. Why? Those profs are mostly only interested
<br>
in their research, not in teaching. My best college educational
<br>
experiences were at the smaller schools: California State colleges
<br>
and junior colleges (with one exception: a private school: Colorado
<br>
School of Mines near Denver). Wherever I end up teaching, I will not
<br>
want it to be at a 'big-name' school.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But nowhere is the problem more vivid than in graduate school. [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What's lacking is a means to provide the rest of our population with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even the most basic understanding of science in an increasingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;science-driven world.
</em><br>
<p>Comparing U.S. and Europe:
<br>
<p>The U.S. system is more flexible to accomodate people entering
<br>
college at different stages of their life. That's a good start. (You
<br>
would never find a person in France breaking up their scientific
<br>
education into chunks, taking long breaks between the degrees, for
<br>
example.) However the costs can be prohibitive, which is where
<br>
European universities have an advantage. It is not unusual to finish
<br>
a PhD in the States being tens of thousands of dollars in debt.
<br>
Since post-doc salaries are also not particularly high, the debt can
<br>
be large crippling factor in someone's life with which to start a
<br>
scientific career.
<br>
<p>Flexibility and cost are two aspects to consider, which might
<br>
discourage people from seriously entering the scientific world.
<br>
<p>Now consider the social and personal aspects of a scientific career
<br>
with a newly-acquired PhD. This is the post-doc phase, where it's
<br>
normal (in the U.S as well as in Europe) to have two or three
<br>
two-year post-doc positions at different institutions before finding
<br>
a job that has some length. Would you want to up-root your family,
<br>
friends, loved ones every two-three years for some long period of
<br>
time? During the eight years I was working at NASA-Ames, I watched
<br>
three generations of post-docs pass through, starting new lives,
<br>
families, making friends, etc. etc, and then have to leave it all.
<br>
It was heartbreaking to watch. This was one factor among several why
<br>
I postponed my own PhD degree for seven years. (and now I'm one
<br>
of &quot;them&quot;.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My friends from around the country tell me that the number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;undergraduate physics majors is at its lowest point since Sputnik,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nearly 50 years ago.
</em><br>
<p>Also true in Europe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But imagine a world in which teaching in high school is such an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attractive profession that it would be worth the trouble of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doctoral level education to get the job. For that to happen, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would have to pay teachers more, at least as much as what graduating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doctoral students get.
</em><br>
<p>(which is not alot....)
<br>
<p>This is a nice dream, BTW. Something, that I would like to see
<br>
come true in my lifetime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Just as important, schools would have to learn to treat these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;teachers with professional respect, and society would have to afford
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them the honor and admiration that professionals expect. This is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unthinkable.
</em><br>
<p>Also a nice dream.
<br>
<p>However, the crux to me is how can a scientist balance in a good way
<br>
the teaching and research aspects of one's scientific life? If you
<br>
focus on being a good researcher, then it's very likely that you
<br>
will not be a good teacher, and vice-versa. The good researchers,
<br>
however, would have the best handle on presenting cutting edge
<br>
and interesting scientific topics to students, and helping them get
<br>
excited about science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Much more is needed, of course. The revolution would have to extend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right down to the first grade. Teachers would have to be literate in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;science, and kids would have to find learning science as cool as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;following the fortunes of rock groups. That's an awful lot to ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for. But then again, only our future depends on it.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, yes, and yes.
