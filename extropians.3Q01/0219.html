</em><br>
<p>Err, I don't know what 'Palestinians' think *now* but there's a massive
<br>
documentation of Arab collaboration with Nazis during WW II and subsequent
<br>
Arab praise -- some quite recent -- for Hitler and Nazism (from Nassar, 
<br>
Sadat, Assad, Arafat, etc.).
<br>
<p>As for the Torah and Das Kapital being viewed as 'balderdash', Islam
<br>
reveres some of the big names in Judaism, like Abraham, there were many 
<br>
years of Arab nations being client states for the Soviets, and some Arab 
<br>
dabbling in Marxism (as in the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen).
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, Israel had its own flirtation with socialism which they still 
<br>
haven't totally recovered from.  One of the reasons I'm a libertarian is 
<br>
having lived there; a small dose of socialism can have an innoculating 
<br>
effect.  (Anders:  what has your political evolution been?)
<br>
<p>Brian's preceding comments re Israel's behavior toward the 'Palestinians'
<br>
strike me as the sort of baiting that triggers our gun flamewars.  There
<br>
is some truth in what he said, but it's a misleading 5% of the total
<br>
story.  I won't get into detailed rebuttal though unless other people
<br>
want to discuss it.
