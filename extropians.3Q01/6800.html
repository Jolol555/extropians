</em><br>
<p>Now Harvey, I didn't say that.  What I *attempted* to do was set up
<br>
a reasonable extropic &quot;corollary&quot; in line with the Principals --
<br>
i.e. the ability to save the greatest number of lives in the shortest
<br>
amount of time is &quot;extropic&quot;.  (People should feel free to attack the
<br>
corollary *or* the means of achieving it.)
<br>
<p>I also object to the use of the term &quot;innocents&quot;, though I do not deny
<br>
that the use of nuclear weapons would of course kill children whom
<br>
one can reasonably consider &quot;innocent&quot;.  An unbiased observation
<br>
of the demonstrations in the streets of towns in Pakistan neighboring
<br>
Afganistan would not label the adults involved in these affairs
<br>
&quot;innocent&quot;.
<br>
<p>As Samantha pointed out, it may be necessary to prioritize the
<br>
Principals so that sentients have self-determination privileges
<br>
that supercede the other goals.
<br>
<p>Now that raises a *very* sticky issue as to what rights one assigns
<br>
to (a) irrational individuals; or (b) individuals who are rational but
<br>
operating from a fundamentally misinformed belief systems?  [Of course
<br>
one is free to question the degree to which all Americans or &quot;Western&quot;
<br>
individuals are operating from misinformed belief systems.]
<br>
<p>Given that individuals exist who have been indoctrinated with
<br>
fundamentally unextropic belief systems -- who have the power or the
<br>
will to intervene in the extropic directions of free societies -- the
<br>
question is &quot;How much are you willing to allow such individuals
<br>
to cost you in extropic productivity?&quot;
<br>
<p>I think this may be the fundamental question -- &quot;What is the value
<br>
of a human life whose read-only-memory is based fundamentally on
<br>
a set of synthetic fabrications?&quot;  *Particularly* if those
<br>
fabrications are likely to represent a threat to individuals
<br>
who base their reality on a more rational examination of the facts?
<br>
<p>How does one tradeoff &quot;human compassion&quot; against &quot;rational meme
<br>
triumph&quot;?

</em><br>
<p>Ok, Hal, can you present a reasonable argument that &quot;how we get
<br>
there&quot; is really important?  One of the difficulties associated
<br>
with being human are feelings such as guilt or empathy.  Those
<br>
feelings need not be propagated into an advanced society.  Moreover,
<br>
we can simply &quot;delete&quot; &quot;how we got there&quot;.  If the end justifies
<br>
the means and the means were unpleasant, then one cen simply
<br>
remove them from our collective memory.
<br>
<p>Alternatively, one can simply &quot;adjust&quot; the perspective that the
<br>
invocation of &quot;unpleasant&quot; methods to produce a result have a
<br>
high degree of value from the perspective of decreasing the time
<br>
and costs to obtain the desired results.
<br>
<p>Here is the challenge --
<br>
<p>How many lives are you willing to sacrifice to do it &quot;cleanly&quot;?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.e. following a logical progression of technological evolution)
<br>
vs. doing it with blood on ones hands?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(pointing to demonstrable numbers of individuals who have been
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;wasted&quot; because it is clear they are pre-programmed or likely
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be pre-programmed from an un-extropic perspective).
