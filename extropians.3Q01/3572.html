<p><em>&gt; The idea you [Loree] are putting forward is, I believe, that to treat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an individual member of a class as if a statistical tendency of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; class automatically applied to the individual... rather than to treat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a person AS an individual... is discrimination.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, I consider such treatment to be prejudice, as one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prejudging the individual based upon the tendencies of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; class, rather than judging him/her on his/her individual merits.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps discrimination is that action that is taken on the basis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of prejudice.
</em><br>
<p>It's even more complicated when we take into consideration the
<br>
particular *action* that is taken.  I heard a young black woman
<br>
on the radio relate that where she lived, if she saw four black 
<br>
men coming down the street, she'd go to the other side, but 
<br>
would not do so if she saw four white men coming.  (I don't
<br>
really wish to speculate what the reasons could be for this;
<br>
it's entirely possible, for example, that in her neighborhood
<br>
black women are considered fair game by black men, but not by
<br>
white men.)
<br>
<p>But it doesn't matter.  Was she discriminating in the sense of
<br>
definition 1?  Or merely prejudiced?  Or neither?   Does her
<br>
own race have a bearing?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From Random House Webster's College dictionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (copyright 1999):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Discriminate:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) to make a distinction in favor of or against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    a person on the basis of the group or class
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    to which that person belongs, rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    according to merit.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 2) to note or observe a difference.
</em><br>
