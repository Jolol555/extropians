Hi Extropes,
<br>
<p>A few weeks ago I wrote a post titled &quot;Encoding the Past&quot;, and I see
<br>
from comments and questions publically and privately by Mitch, that
<br>
I may not have been clear enough. In case others are similarly
<br>
craving clarification, here, I will try to describe in a little
<br>
more detail how dust can encode some parameters from the past.
<br>
<p>First his questions:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Is recovering information from planetary or interstellar, or intergalactic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dust potentially possible?
</em><br>
<p>It depends what you mean by 'recovering'. If you mean by recovering,
<br>
&quot;extract some information regarding the dust particle's source and
<br>
the environment through which the particle travels&quot;, the answer
<br>
is 'yes'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;by asking if its hypothetically conceivable, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;personalities and memories may be, indeed, recoverable, potentially, by some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vast, Matrioska-Brained technology, albeit, astronomically, distant time in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the future?
</em><br>
<p>No. Dust doesn't have DNA, i.e. it has no blueprint for making
<br>
a living entity.
<br>
<p>Think of dust like you would a photon. Physics tells you alot about
<br>
the source of that photon, as well as the environment through which
<br>
the photon travelled. My bias (but that's mostly because I'm a dusty
<br>
astronomer) is that dust carries more information than a photon. Dust
<br>
is a multidisciplinary topic, those fields include astronomy, plasma
<br>
physics, solid state physics, quantum physics, statistical physics,
<br>
electrodynamics, classical physics, fractal math, nonlinear physics,
<br>
and some chemistry, for starters. BTW, the physics involved is not
<br>
particularly new. Most of the physics in my simulations is directly
<br>
from Maxwell and Newton, and the other equations which depend on the
<br>
particle's optical properties and the currents generated, are about
<br>
20 years old.
<br>
<p>I said previously:
<br>
<p>&quot;Once detected, it's an inverse problem to determine what processes
<br>
brought that encoded object (dust) to the detector. The particle
<br>
wouldn't have reached the detector unless its initial motion,
<br>
material properties, the intervening plasma and magnetic field held
<br>
particular values. Slightly changing any of these parameters gives
<br>
drastically different dust dynamical behavior (via the charge in the
<br>
Lorentz force, which is, _by far_, the dominant force acting on
<br>
submicron circum/interplanetary and interstellar dust particles), so
<br>
then we know quickly about where that object came from, and what is
<br>
(in) the intervening medium.&quot;
<br>
<p>To clarify the above paragraph.
<br>
<p>Assume that a dust particle was detected at the detector. To bring
<br>
that particle to the detector, we need to assume Forces, so then
<br>
some ordinary physics enters here. The forces are, _at least_:
<br>
<p>* Planet(s)' gravitational force
<br>
* Light Pressure force
<br>
* Lorentz force
<br>
* Solar gravitational force
<br>
<p>Plus, the dynamics must have:
<br>
<p>* The initial conditions for the forces are position and velocity.
<br>
* The value of the magnetic field must be known/assumed (for B in the
<br>
Lorentz force).
<br>
<p>The other free parameters are, _at least_,
<br>
<p>1) dust particle's density and radius
<br>
2) radiation pressure scattering coefficient (this is essentially
<br>
the dust particle's optical property),
<br>
3) parameters for calculating currents:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) plasma parameters for the ion/electron collection current
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) photoelectric energy distribution and yield,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) secondary electron emission and yield.
<br>
<p>The items 2), 3) are coupled with the particle's density and
<br>
radius. I'm assuming spherical particles, which is not at all
<br>
accurate, but it's the best that we can do for now.
<br>
<p>The last item, (3), refers to the specific currents generated on the
<br>
particle's surface, and so then, here we need to know the (plasma
<br>
conditions+mag field) through which the particle is travelling.
<br>
<p>------------
<br>
Explanation of the Currents: (Gritty details, so skip if not interested).
<br>
<p>3a) The ion/electron collection current is simply the ions/electrons
<br>
that collect on the surface of the particle as it's sampling the
<br>
plasma. (depends on the charge potential already carried by the
<br>
particle and its velocity)
<br>
3b) The photoelectron current, which is positive, is when a photon
<br>
impacts onto the dust particle and releases electrons,
<br>
3c) The secondary electron emission current is when a high-energy
<br>
electron or ion from the plasma impacts onto the dust particle and
<br>
releases secondary electrons. The smaller the particle, the more
<br>
electrons that can be released because the electron can travel
<br>
quicker to the other side of the particle. The secondary electron
<br>
emission current is a positive current too, because electrons are
<br>
released.
<br>
<p>The secondary electron emission current is an interesting current,
<br>
and one of which many astronomers are not aware. I say
<br>
'interesting', because it depends directly on the dust's material
<br>
properties (similar to the photoelectron emission current). A SiO2
<br>
particle will require a higher energy electron or ion to release &quot;x&quot;
<br>
electrons than a SO particle. The values for the electron or ion
<br>
energy and number of released electrons are found in lab
<br>
experiments, and published in places like the _CRC Handbook of
<br>
Chemistry and Physics_. Apparently the lab experiments are diffcult
<br>
to repeat exactly and that is one reason why dust charging processes
<br>
are a &quot;rough&quot; science.
<br>
------------
<br>
<p>After we sum up all of the currents generated on the particle, these
<br>
currents go into the &quot;Q&quot; parameter of the Lorentz force. For
<br>
submicron particles, the Lorentz force is about 100 times larger
<br>
than the planetary gravity, therefore, knowing the charge Q of the
<br>
dust particle is important to determine a particle's trajectory.
<br>
<p>Now you know some of the physics details showing how the dust
<br>
particle's environment (plasma+mag field+radiation) and particle
<br>
properties (for optical, charging terms), and dust particle's source
<br>
(for initial position and velocity) enters into the inverse problem.
<br>
The particle wouldn't have reached the detector unless its initial
<br>
motion, material properties, the intervening plasma and magnetic
<br>
field held particular values.
<br>
<p>Frequency analysis can reveal information about the dust particle's
<br>
source, as well. For example, Io's frequency of orbital rotation is
<br>
~42 hours -- this period appears often in the Galileo dust detector
<br>
data from the last 5 years, while _inside_ of Jupiter's magnetosphere.
<br>
In addition, last summer, both Cassini and Galileo, while travelling
<br>
_outside_ of Jupiter's magnetosphere, detected a dust 'storm': my
<br>
frequency analysis showed that Io was the major source during this
<br>
storm too.
<br>
<p>Another example of how we can learn something of the dust particle's
<br>
source and environment is the detection of interstellar particles
<br>
coming into our Solar System. The particles impacting on the Galileo
<br>
and Ulysses dust detectors give us speed, mass, direction. How do we
<br>
know that the particles were coming from outside of the Solar
<br>
System? The interstellar dust particles' trajectories showed that
<br>
they were on unbound orbits to the Sun, moving with the flow of
<br>
interstellar gas. Their dynamics revealed a specific orientation of
<br>
the Sun's magnetic field (which flips over every 11 years), and
<br>
intervening plasma. Other instruments such as the radar station:
<br>
AMOR in New Zealand have even extrapolated thousands of interstellar
<br>
dust particle's trajectories towards a source: the star system: beta
<br>
Pic.
<br>
<p>So you see, Mitch, no magic physics and no Jupiter brain necessary.
<br>
And remember what I said to Robert: the lifetimes of the particles
<br>
are on the order of tens or hundreds of thousands of years, so it's
<br>
not really possible (yet) to extrapolate back in time before that.
<br>
Plus, once we figure out better how to handle fractal-shaped
<br>
particles, the problem gets considerably more complicated.
<br>
<p>Hope that this clarified things a bit.
<br>
