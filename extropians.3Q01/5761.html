<em>&gt; &gt; Going to the grocery store, I don't really see a revolution in frozen food
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; compared with what I saw thirty years ago, at least not yet. It seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; take up a comparable amount of shelf space, anyway. Do you have sources for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your assertion about falling cooking times?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Purely speculative and anecdotal on my part. However, the _range_ of stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on offer is increasing, and that's a market that is highly price-sensitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and very competitive. I doubt supermarkets would be so full of Indian-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restaurant-in-a-bag-ready-to-microwave packaged meals if there wasn't a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growing market for them.
</em><br>
<p>And it's not so much the quantity (although comparing western with
<br>
eastern bloc country grocery stores is a nice juxtaposition), but the
<br>
price. Food prices have dropped markedly over the past century such that
<br>
significant government intervention is generally required to stabilize
<br>
food prices upwards against selling panics on an annual basis. Without
<br>
this intervention, prices would be even lower than they are, and there
<br>
would be even greater variety.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; And what are the implications for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; teleoperator-controlled surgery in, say, a decade's time, when that same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; video generation begins graduating from medical school?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Potentially important. Medical improvements are also problematic in much the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same way that software improvements are. Antibiotics are clearly a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; revolutionary technology. Techniques like telesurgery or focused radiation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; treatments are harder to call out as their own revolutions, though they may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have the potential to become as important as antibiotics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I missed out microsurgery. Thirty years ago, if you lost a finger or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hand -- tough. These days, pack it in ice and take it along and there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good chance that not only can they re-attach it, but they can even save
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some neural connections.
</em><br>
<p>And even if they can't save it, they can frequently build robotic arms
<br>
that respond to nerve signals at ever greater levels of complexity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Organ transplants: in 1971, heart transplants were -- publicity aside --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grand-standing experimentation. Today, thanks to much better immunosupressant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agents, many people can run for years or decades on replacement organs. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't have the Chinese government harvesting organs from executed felons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a la Larry Niven) if it wasn't a technology that had arrived.
</em><br>
<p>Now they want to grow transplant organs for you on or in genetically
<br>
engineered farm animals. That photo of the mouse with the human ear
<br>
growing on its back was one of the coolest images I've seen. When this
<br>
becomes commonplace, expect human longevity to skyrocket. Today they
<br>
announced that they've successfully produced every type of human blood
<br>
cell from stem cells, leading to an end of the need for blood donation
<br>
drives and shortage caused deaths sometime in the next several years.
<br>
<em>&gt;From growing you new nerves, new spinal cords, and new brain lobes, we
</em><br>
are on the cusp of really fantastic things in health care.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again: the laser. In 1960 it was a miracle of quantum mechanics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that required expensive synthetic rubies and demonstrated a physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle. By 1970, some expensive military applications had shown up --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rangefingers, for example -- and holography was becoming a curiosity. By
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1980, there was suddenly a market, with the advent of the CD player. By
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1990, holography was becoming commercialised as something you can make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prints of, and CD players were everywhere. Today, I have a £5 laser
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointer for playing with my cat, and dentists use 'em for de-scaling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teeth and drilling out dental caries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it was there before 1970. But the mass production and commercialisation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasn't.
</em><br>
<p>Ayup, which is why you want to look at overall economic data as well.
<br>
Rates of invention don't mean squat if they are not applied to human
<br>
lives. Economics measures this.
