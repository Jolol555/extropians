<em>&gt;From: Miriam English &lt;<a href="mailto:miriam@werple.net.au?Subject=Re:%20Paying%20for%20Schools&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108241804.LAA26215@well.com&gt;">miriam@werple.net.au</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;So you reckon that people at the bottom of the economic ladder
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should get to send their kids to the same kind of school that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do now but pay for it?
</em><br>
<p>They can send their kids to any school they can afford.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;OK. :-) Do you remember why these people are called poor? It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because  they don't have money. Given the choice between putting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;food on the table and getting their kids some kind of education,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guess which will get dropped.
</em><br>
<p>The reason they are poor is because they make bad decisions, like
<br>
having a bunch of kids that they cannot afford. I used to be poor,
<br>
but I made the right decisions and now no longer am, they can too.
<br>
This is a social policy that needs to be changed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If the upper classes don't want a poverty-stricken class that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self perpetuating, hates the rich vehemently, and is a breeding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ground for disease and warped memes, then they need to do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sensible and humane thing and ensure that kids of the poor have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chance at a better life. Often the only way to do that is to give
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them a good education -- free.
</em><br>
<p>It's the middle classes that oppose this as well, and we'll start
<br>
by eliminating programs that make the problem worse, like welfare.
<br>
TANSTAAFL &quot;There ain't no such thing as a free lunch&quot;. Somebody has
<br>
been paying for it and is no longer interested. It's personnal
<br>
responsibility time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I have nothing against private education, but it is not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solution to all educational needs. Likewise free market economics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can be extremely useful, but there are definite limits to its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;usefulness.
</em><br>
<p>This isn't a private/public school issue alone, it's also about who
<br>
pays for it, I vote everybody pays a little, and the parents pay
<br>
most.
