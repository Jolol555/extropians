<em>&gt; Jerry Mitchell writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;an economic system characterized by private or corporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by private decision rather than by state control, and by prices,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; production, and the distribution of goods that are determined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mainly by competition in a free market.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That definition was supplied by Barbara, Jerry, not me :-)
</em><br>
<p>Woops, sorry ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nature imposes Capitalism, man imposes all other forms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Too many libertarians, in my opinion, forget the importance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of culture.  Actually, a hunter-gatherer communism is probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more &quot;natural&quot; than capitalism.  But even very developed societies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as the Inca, might very well somehow make some form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communism work (lots of things are possible when your leader
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really is God).
</em><br>
<p>A tribe commune already has its hands full making sure that the &quot;good and
<br>
services&quot; are equally divided. The chief would have to punish those who
<br>
didn't work as hard as the others, or make sure they got less. Imagine the
<br>
complexity of this situation magnified MILLIONS of times in a modern day
<br>
society. That's why I say its not natural per se.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can probably safely state, however, that for human beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism is &quot;natural&quot; if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  there is a sufficient tradition of liberty in a culture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.  the ruling government or state is not overly powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.  no existing religion has absolute control, unless it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     fairly mild and isn't antithetical to profit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that I see why you wish to describe capitalism as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;natural&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Capitalism is after all is what happens when one quits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trying to impose systems on man.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While I can't agree with that for the aforesaid reasons, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true that in comparison, systems that arise from the concentration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of power at a central focus seem artificial in comparison.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ok, maybe then we include that capitalism is the system that will be
<br>
obtained by removing all other systems while still keeping within a
<br>
framework of liberty, rights, and primarily &quot;reason&quot;. Chiefs couldn't
<br>
control people there like so much cattle. Details on how to obtain this
<br>
miraculous state, to be determined in the future by objective political
<br>
scientist cause I certainly don't have all the answers.
