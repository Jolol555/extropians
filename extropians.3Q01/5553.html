<p>
The problem, as I see it, is that these CEOs don't deserve a raise for these
<br>
layoffs.  The logic is that cost-cutting makes the company more efficient
<br>
and raises profits.  However, these layoffs aren't really cost-cutting.
<br>
<p>True cost-cutting occurs when a new efficient method is found to produce the
<br>
same services cheaper.  If a company were to announce some major
<br>
breakthrough technology that allows them to do more with less, this would be
<br>
true cost-cutting.  They then could cut jobs while maintaining productivity.
<br>
This would decrease the cost-to-benefit ration and product more profits.
<br>
<p>But when a company cannot compete in the market or spends more to produce
<br>
its services than they are worth, this company is failing.  Such a company
<br>
is destroying resources without adding value.  Simply laying off employees
<br>
without a new methodology won't change the cost-to-benefit ratio.  By
<br>
cutting resources and using the same methods, these companies are cutting
<br>
costs and benefits.  These CEOs are in effect saying that since they
<br>
destroying value rather than creating value, the best course is for them to
<br>
do as little as possible.  They aren't making more with less.  They are
<br>
making less with less to minimize the impacts of their value destruction.
<br>
<p>Such a company is destroying resources with no net benefits.  Such a CEO is
<br>
failing at the job.  Claiming that this course of action is &quot;cost-cutting&quot;
<br>
or &quot;profit-making&quot; is simply fraud.  Such a CEO is defrauding the
<br>
stock-holders and is driving up debt to line his own pockets.
