<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
<p>Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT)
<br>
<p>The National Cancer Institute and the Southwest Oncololgy Group, a research
<br>
organization, are recruiting volunteers for the largest prostate cancer
<br>
prevention trial to date.  The study will last twelve years and will test
<br>
the preventive benefits of selenium and vitamin E, separately and together,
<br>
against prostate cancer.  Both nutrients have shown preventive benefits
<br>
against cancer in other clinical trials.  The study will be known as the
<br>
Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial, or SELECT.
<br>
<p>Participants are being recruited from four hundred sites in the United
<br>
States including Puerto Rico, and Canada.  The trial's organizers are
<br>
seeking male volunteers aged fifty-five and over who have not been diagnosed
<br>
with any cancer (with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer).
<br>
African-American men may join at age fifty because of the younger average
<br>
age at which prostate cancer is diagnosed in this group.  There is no upper
<br>
age limit for volunteers.
<br>
<p>Southwest Oncology Group Chairman Charles A Coltman, Jr, MD, stated, &quot;We are
<br>
looking for quite a few good men to join SELECT because it is an incredibly
<br>
important prostate cancer prevention study. Previous research with vitamin E
<br>
and selenium -- in studies focused on other kinds of cancer -- suggested
<br>
that these nutrients might prevent prostate cancer. SELECT is focused on
<br>
prostate cancer and, when the study is finished, we will know for sure
<br>
whether these supplements can prevent the disease.&quot;
<br>
<p>The study will seek to confirm the benefits of the selenium and vitamin E
<br>
observed in previous trials.  One, in 1996, investigated the benefit of
<br>
selenium supplementation in the prevention of nonmelanoma skin cancer.
<br>
Although the mineral did not prevent skin cancer, male participants
<br>
experienced a 60% decrease in the incidence of prostate cancer compared to
<br>
the control population.  In another study involving 29,000 male smokers,
<br>
vitamin E supplementation was associated with a 32% reduction in prostate
<br>
cancer incidence.
<br>
<p>NCI Division of Cancer Prevention's associate director for clinical
<br>
research, Leslie Ford, MD, commented, &quot;SELECT is the critical next step for
<br>
pursuing the promising leads we saw for the prevention of prostate cancer.
<br>
The only way to determine the real value of these supplements for prostate
<br>
cancer is to do a large clinical trial focused specifically on this
<br>
disease.&quot;
<br>
<p>Although joining the study provides an excellent opportunity to aid the
<br>
progress of medical research, the possibility of receiving an inert placebo
<br>
and the prerequisite that one not take supplements containing either vitamin
<br>
E or selenium for the length of the trial could be unwise for men at risk of
<br>
the disease.  Because moderate doses of these nutrients have caused little
<br>
in the way of side effects for most people, we may all benefit from lifelong
<br>
supplementation to help prevent cancer and other diseases.
<br>

<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
<p>Prostate Cancer Overview
<br>
<p>The Life Extension Foundation has developed an extensive array of integrated
<br>
prostate cancer therapies based on published scientific findings and the
<br>
clinical experience of practicing oncologists. After reading the following
<br>
Overview, many lay people will require the assistance of their attending
<br>
oncologist, as some of the protocols are technically challenging. This
<br>
Overview should be read first by the patient and the physician, and then the
<br>
appropriate protocol(s) referred to depending upon the stage of the disease
<br>
and the therapies being considered. A complete listing of these specific
<br>
prostate cancer protocols is printed at the end of this Overview.
<br>
<p>Unlike most forms of cancer, early-stage prostate cancer is usually
<br>
controllable with hormone (testosterone)-blocking therapy. The drugs used to
<br>
contain early-stage prostate cancer are FDA-approved, yet only a small
<br>
percentage of urologists are using hormone-blocking therapy properly in
<br>
treating early-stage prostate cancer patients. The scientific literature
<br>
indicates that radical prostatectomy (surgical removal of the prostate) and
<br>
external beam radiation therapy fail to produce an acceptable percentage of
<br>
long-term, disease-free survival. The severe long-term side effects of these
<br>
conventional therapies (surgery and external-beam radiation) are well
<br>
documented.
<br>
<p>In lieu of radical surgery or external beam radiation, prostate cancer
<br>
patients may want to consider the Life Extension Foundation's early- stage
<br>
protocols that incorporate combined testosterone, 5-alpha-reductase, and
<br>
prolactin inhibition for temporary control of most prostate cancers.
<br>
Innovative natural therapies can be implemented upon the initiation of
<br>
hormone-blocking drug therapies.  The goal is to give these natural
<br>
therapies an opportunity to keep the PSA (prostate-specific antigen)
<br>
measurement at a nondetectable level after the discontinuation of 3 to 12
<br>
months of combined hormone blockade.
<br>
<p>Intermittent hormone-blockade drug therapy is advised for almost all
<br>
prostate cancer patients, since this greatly enhances the time before
<br>
prostate cancer cells become androgen-independent. Intermittent therapy
<br>
involves a prostate cancer patient only using hormone blockade for 3 to 12
<br>
months, and then waiting until the PSA score approaches 20 before resuming.
<br>
This of course is a general guideline for physicians and patients to
<br>
consider.

<br>
<p>Prostate cancer:  PSA parameters and hereditary factors
<br>
<p>Prostate cancer (PC) is now being linked to genetic abnormalities that
<br>
explain the familial occurrence of PC that we frequently see. An
<br>
understanding of why PC affects certain populations of men more than others
<br>
is now becoming better understood. We know that PC is equally as prevalent
<br>
in Asian men as in Western men, but that the frequency of biologically
<br>
aggressive PC is significantly greater in the non-Asian population. This
<br>
finding is felt to be possibly related to the lower amount of dietary fat in
<br>
the Asian diet as well as the frequent use of soy products and a higher
<br>
intake of green tea polyphenols (Aldercreutz et al., Proc. Annu. Meet.
<br>
Cancer Res.).
<br>
<p>In the United States, 74% of men with PC are considered to have &quot;sporadic&quot;
<br>
PC, while the remaining 26% demonstrate evidence of genetic clustering.
<br>
Within the 26%, 19% are cases of hereditary PC (HPC) versus 81% designated
<br>
as familial PC (FPC) (Bastacky et al., J. Urol., 1995). Familial prostate
<br>
cancer is defined as the simple clustering of the cancer in families,
<br>
whereas hereditary prostate cancer requires any of the following three
<br>
criteria: a family with three generations affected, three first-degree
<br>
(brother[s] or father) relatives affected, or three relatives affected
<br>
before the age of 55 years (Carter et al., J. Urol., 1993). Men with either
<br>
FPC or HPC are prime candidates for preventive approaches involving
<br>
nutritional adjuncts.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Super Selenium Complex
<br>
<p>As an essential cofactor of glutathione peroxidase, selenium is an important
<br>
antioxidant. It is also involved with iodine metabolism, pancreatic
<br>
function, DNA repair, immunity and the detoxification of heavy metals.
<br>
Studies have shown that selenium can help prevent some cancers and
<br>
cataracts.
<br>
<p>Super Selenium Complex contains the most advanced forms of selenium on the
<br>
market. Vitamin E has been added because it works synergistically with
<br>
selenium.

<p>Saw Palmetto/Nettle Root Extract
<br>
<p>Enlargement of the prostate gland occurs in most men with advancing age and
<br>
is accompanied by reduced urinary flow and increased residual urine volume.
<br>
Hormonal imbalances have previously been blamed for age related prostate
<br>
disorders, but other factors have been identified as causes of the benign
<br>
proliferation of prostate cells (BPH) and accompanying urinary impairment
<br>
caused by this condition. Men with severe BPH often use a combination of saw
<br>
palmetto and pygeum to improve urine flow and bladder voiding. These men
<br>
usually wake up less frequently at night to urinate.
<br>
<p>Newly published studies reveal evidence that men over age 50 should take
<br>
nettle root extract in addition to saw palmetto extract, for the purpose of
<br>
preventing prostate diseases. As men age, their ratio of estrogen to
<br>
testosterone increases, making it important to inhibit the effects of
<br>
estrogens, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and dihydrotestosterone
<br>
(DHT). While saw palmetto protects against prostate enlargement caused by
<br>
DHT, nettle root is required to inhibit the proliferation of prostate cells
<br>
in response to estrogen and SHBG. Since we now have a biochemical
<br>
understanding of how nettle functions in the body, it would appear that most
<br>
men could both prevent and effectively treat BPH by taking Super Saw
<br>
Palmetto/Nettle Root.
<br>
<p>Super Saw Palmetto/Nettle Root contains a methanolic nettle root extract
<br>
that is more effective than the former ethanol extract, as well as the
<br>
highly effective supercritical CO2 saw palmetto extract.
