Oy.

<p>True.

<p><em>&gt; Terrorists aren't roaming the streets shooting people.
</em><br>
<p>Not in the US, now. True.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If every single New Yorker was armed yesterday, that would

</em><br>
<p>Ah. Obviously. But what if every single (sane, adult) Bostonian, including 
<br>
all those nonterrorists that boarded the planes in Boston, had been armed? 
<br>
Or, say, just the flight crew?
<br>
<p>Not meaning to carp. Just saying, is all. 
<br>
<p>So let's skip to the meat of the matter.
<br>
<p>It started with boxcutters and the lower average level of terror that one can match 
<br>
up with the implicit &quot;rules&quot; for hijackings most people here have taken for given, viz. 
<br>
&quot;We can get out of this if we're careful; just take them where they want to go, 
<br>
and do what they say.&quot; &quot;We can negotiate.&quot; ...et pitiful cetera.
<br>
These mantras are no longer in effect; it has a certain clarifying effect.
<br>
<p>Everyone keeps saying this isn't a movie, but they're partly wrong.
<br>
The effectors of these sad events have put us in a Bruce Willis or Stephen Segall scenario.
<br>
<p>Or, maybe, Terminator. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Listen. And understand. That terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. 
<br>
It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. 
<br>
And it absolutely  will  not  stop,  ever,  until  you  are  dead.&quot;
<br>
<p>Which sucks. Sorry for the drama, but it's called for, for once. That level of focus, to
<br>
use a neutral word, is necessary for success. Going the extra five minutes.
<br>
<p>The ability to deal deadly force on an instant's notice just got epsilon more valuable here
<br>
in the ol' US of A. 
<br>
<p>That sucks, too. But that's what's at issue here, not guns per se. 
<br>
<p>MMB, who doesn't like vigilantes but likes terrorists just a skosh less...
