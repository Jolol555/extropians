</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I've been wading through the posts on this list for the last week,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most filled with the heady opinions of armchair warriors (dove and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hawk alike), while keeping my opinions on the matters of the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to myself.  But instead of offering my opinion on the terrorism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incident, I'm going to give my opinion of this list's opinions in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a general sort of way.
</em><br>
<p>Many of us are former soldiers, and as is well known there is no
<br>
such thing as an EX-Marine only former Marines.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This list has totally lost its perspective.  As extropians, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*do* have a long-term agenda last I checked, there are two ways to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;address this particular threat, a threat that is far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complicated than any simple analysis will solve anyway.  The first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way is to eliminate it in an offensive fashion, actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;destroying it so that it has minimal ability to damage us.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;second is a defensive mode, minimizing the ability of the threat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to harm us if it chooses to engage us.  But like in so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things, reality decides these things for us by and large.
</em><br>
<p>We have to insure a short term future in order to have a long term
<br>
agenda.
<br>
<p>So first your opinion is that there is no simple analysis, then you
<br>
proceed to give us one.
<br>
<p>Here's mine, first we neutralize the immediate threat, find and
<br>
destroy the perpetrators, then we look at long term prevention.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The reality is that extropians have no real business discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;offensive measures because, quite frankly, extropians have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;negligible impact on the massive engine of inertia that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government policy, particularly with issues like this.  The world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;turns as the world turns.  Offering platitudes as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who/what/when/where should be attacked in the Middle East is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing more than emotional masturbation, and offers nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;constructive that could be construed as defending an extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future.  I could get this on a dozen other sites, and the quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be better in some cases.  There *is* some causality at work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here; if extropians actually had something of substantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;value to add in this regard then they might also be in a position
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to influence it.  But from where I sit, we are often
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indistinguishable from a high-rise yuppie or a trailer park yokel,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;value-wise.
</em><br>
<p>Again you complain against platitudes then begin issuing your own.
<br>
<p>As extropians everything that goes on in the world is of interest
<br>
to us and therefore subject to discussion. Especially something of
<br>
this magnitude which could affect our very existence.
<br>
<p>Society is a non-linear dynamic, the action of individuals can
<br>
dramatically affect the whole. What greater proof do you need then
<br>
what has occurred.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Which leads me to my second point: hunkering down and spending our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time on things that matter.  If we can agree that as individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and as a group we can not effectively and rationally attack this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particular threat to an extropian future, then it is imperative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that we think of how to accomplish our goals in the shadow of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;great threats (and the forces that counter them) for which we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;limited preemptive offensive capabilities.  And by &quot;rationally&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I mean taking a long-term view with your ultimate goals in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mind.  This is a far more constructive approach for a number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reasons. First of all, it is relatively easy for an individual to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ensure their survival and the perpetuation of their goals. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Second, the passive nature of these measures take little focus
</em><br>
<em>&gt;away from our primary goals.  Third, security and safety is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;network effect; the people around you are safer for your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individual effort and may reciprocate.
</em><br>
<p>Again immediate concerns must be addressed if there are to be long
<br>
term goals. The rest of this paragraph seems to back this point. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My last and most important point is that extropians are in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;business of creating the ultimate trump cards, technologies that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can permanently render the threats we are facing obsolete.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are escalating issues and competing forces today which threaten to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;severely blunt our goals, thereby rendering us helpless to stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even greater threats than those which most people think about. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The endgame is upon us, and we are in a race against those that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would stop us; if we fail or even slow down too much, we will die
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eventually.  My goal in surviving isn't to survive another day,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but to win the game.  Destroying terrorism isn't a win, but merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a draw; spending effort doing so in no way ensures my long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt;survival and may indeed hamper it.  It is therefore imperative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that energy be devoted to actual solving the problems that we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solve rather than pissing in the wind over short-term issues that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are largely beyond our control.  In the long run, maximizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;productivity towards our goals is the winning strategy, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;engaging in brush fires, even big ones, that would be cheaper to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;avoid. Even if we can solve some problems it doesn't mean doing so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is an effective use of effort and resources given a particular set
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of goals and a very finite quantity of time.
</em><br>
<p>This isn't a brush fire, it's a war, and the reason it happened is
<br>
because the government previously took your advice and ignored the
<br>
brush fire that is now a raging inferno.
<br>
<p>Terrorism is one of the ultimate forces of entropy and therefore a
<br>
fitting target for extropians.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If I die, it will be of precious little comfort to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everyone else died first.
</em><br>
<p><p>Agreed, I want as few to die as possible, limiting it to all of
<br>
those responsible is sufficient.
