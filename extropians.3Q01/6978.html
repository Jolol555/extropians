<p>&lt;Hello <a href="mailto:deepbluehalo@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Greg%20Johnson%20on%20dropping%20the%20alliance%20with%20Israel&In-Reply-To=&lt;004101c13fee$75a50580$5854f7a5@computer&gt;">deepbluehalo@earthlink.net</a> (Brian Phillips),
<br>
<p>In reference to your comment:
<br>
<p>I'm a Jew. I don't believe in much, in the religious sense, but I don't
<br>
believe that pacifism can be a one way street. So here is my view on the
<br>
listed attitude. Its a typical Waspy attitude, that surely persisted before
<br>
world war two, and has continued unto this hour. As far as I am concerned,
<br>
the blame Israel crowd is largely the same, whatever the protestations to
<br>
the
<br>
contrary, as those who knew about Hitler's ultimate goals, (like the US
<br>
State
<br>
Department) and didn't give a shit anyway; and frankly don't today, and
<br>
secretly enjoy what happened...so be it.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aha! T'would seem I'm &quot;anaziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews&quot;.  Imagine that!
<br>
&nbsp;Well guess what guy, I don't cringe at the old &quot;you're really just an
<br>
anti-semite
<br>
sympathizer in disguise or denial&quot; routine.  It's old hat by now. And if
<br>
you think it's a problem...well go play in Gaza or something.. I've no use
<br>
for it.
<br>
<p>&lt;The USA can change its foreign policy to whatever it wants. Maybe it can be
<br>
squeezed, but I don't think it you can squeeze it to surrender. So, do your
<br>
worst. Enjoy your OPEC oil, and remember all those Saudi billionaires who
<br>
fund the Al Qedas Movement, because next time they'll use sarin, or
<br>
strontium, or smallpox. But hey, what's more important then a nice
<br>
portfolio? &gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the risk of pointing out the obvious I'd remind you that I was
<br>
suggesting
<br>
NOT enjoying the OPEC oil, but rather sticking to our own neck of the woods
<br>
and minding our own business. You have real nerve twisting a statement that
<br>
&quot;we should let Israel go her own way, and focus on exploiting what we have
<br>
right here in the THIS half of the world&quot; into some weird attack like this.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You lost LOTS of face on this one.  I am a Southron sort, which means
<br>
that a &quot;nice portfolio&quot; is a lot less important to me than peaceful real
<br>
estate.  If anything it makes me less of an Extropian sort, since I tend
<br>
to think in tribal/regionalist terms rather than the big future picture
<br>
sometimes.   I tend to focus on the bioregionalism of the Appalachians
<br>
and how to preserve folkways in a future that is happening right now.
<br>
I don't care if you are a jew, or even if Israel as a state exists. It's
<br>
a non-issue. I don't buy into guilt trips by Eretz Israel, guy. The
<br>
Shoah is over, and besides it didn't happen here.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm far more concerned about whether the fog in the mornings
<br>
is as thick as usual than whether the ADL has it's knickers in
<br>
a twist.
<br>
<p>have a great Rosh Hashanah guy!
<br>
Brian
<br>
(for the interests of accuracy I've included the passage that
<br>
marks me as a OPEC oil-loving, WASP stock-junkie
<br>
&quot;naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews&quot; below.)
<br>
è Negative ma'am.  The United States can do just fine by
<br>
è opening up Alaska and contenting itself with the
<br>
è petroleum rescources here in the Western
<br>
è Hemisphere.  In truth that's likely one reason why
<br>
è liberals want to conserve Alaska (regardless of what
<br>
è rights and  wishs of Alaskan state citizens) and lock
<br>
è up the state in a straitjacket of Wetlands Laws and
<br>
è various pseudo-Green nonsense.   An America that
<br>
è utilized it's own rescources and those of it's natural
<br>
è (geographically adjacent) allies would not NEED to be
<br>
è playing realpolitik on the behalf of Tel Aviv (and would
<br>
è not need the &quot;Excuse&quot; of middle east oil).  I suspect
<br>
è Europe might have to pay it's own way a bit more
<br>
è then.....    What's weird is fossil fuel economies are on
<br>
è their last surge before they are abandoned...why are
<br>
è we &quot;saving&quot; supplies in the Western Hemisphere at the
<br>
è cost of American lives?    cheers, Brian
