Harvey:
<br>
<p>Your concerns are right on the money. Over the long haul, we have to _export_
<br>
the Bill of Rights, not clamp down on them. Anything less and we won't win the
<br>
hearts and minds--anything less and we will deserve to have generations of enemies.
<br>
<p>This is the task before us, the citizenry--by which I mean every one _not_ 
<br>
subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, each and every one--to maintain 
<br>
our freedoms *and* shoulder our responsibilities. To set an example for the world.
<br>
<p>Those in the military? Well, they get to gripe, and follow lawful orders.
<br>
<p>I am prepared to be very vocal now that the die has been cast; but no secession talk,
<br>
no brooding about jackbooted thugs. Noisy honesty is the best policy, along
<br>
with ruthless self-examination--&quot;Is this argument necessary?&quot; If it is, I will
<br>
not shirk my duty to argue, and speak out, and (in extremis) disobey civilly.
<br>
<p>I will not tolerate the corruption of all I hold dear.
<br>
<p>MMB
<br>
<p>PS:  I knew all that Boy Scout upbringing would be good for something someday. :) Fuckin' A.
<br>
<p>PPS/tangent: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit of noisy honesty: It is possible to be cuir and still be &quot;morally straight&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BSA policy on gays is wrong, but so is using the courts to &quot;fix&quot; it. Both sides should grow up.

<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;&gt; Consider the confused but dangerous yammering of the &quot;anti-globalists.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Where do they stand?  Their program of cultural balkanaziation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; provides the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perfect breeding ground for bin Laden's vermin.  They are without doubt an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unwitting fifth column for his brand of international &quot;cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrorists,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because in the deeply divided world they seek to create, Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fundamentalism will thrive as a powerful and motivated universalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ideology. Bush defined at least the beginnings of an internationalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mentality that can be premised on values strong enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; withstand both the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; calls of the critics to step back from progress and the jihad of the armed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mullahs.  Again, if Bush has begun the process of recasting the West's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; identity in terms of vigorous self-confidence, then we have indeed seen a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;pivotal moment in history&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the most important thing.  I am proud of the way Bush handled this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His speech and planning is the best I have seen from a U.S. president in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However...  My fear is that his support is based on the immediate emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction to recent events.  There are many fundamentalist factions within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our own country and around the world that don't want to be part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global community.  There are religious leaders in this country that do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to protect what they consider to be false religions.  There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isolationists who do not want to mingle or cooperate with other people.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fear that much of the fervor is being driven not just by patriots and those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fighting for good, but also by those who want to use this as an excuse to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become more isolationist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As the years pass, and our targets become more and more diverse, I expect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see support waning.  After the WTC and Pentagon attackers are dealt with,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how many people want to risk American lives to stop terrorism in the Middle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; East?  How many people want the U.S. to be part of a global task force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of a single military leader?  How many people want to increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international cooperation, commerce, immigration and trade?  There is a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of support now due to selfish U.S. interests.  I commend Bush for taking the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger and more long-term view of this crisis.  However when the immediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat is gone, and it comes time to risk American lives to protect foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultures from foreign terrorism, I am not sure how strong the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolve will be maintained.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Although this crisis has united Americans and all civilized countries in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short term, I am predicting that we will see more desperate retaliation from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racists, isolationists, nationalist, religionists, and luddites from within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our own ranks.  The attack of religionists against gays, liberals and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ACL has already occurred.  The battle over privacy and encryption has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already begun.  Battles over due process, search and seizure, and homeland
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security restrictions will be next.  This crisis has strengthened the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolve various subcultures, but it has also intensified the contrast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between differing agendas.
