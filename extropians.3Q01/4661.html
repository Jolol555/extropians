<em>&gt; &gt; After doing some research a while back, I basically went

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; education in this country has been disasterous for the most

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problem is that so many people are used to sucking off the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government teat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they are unwilling to exercise their right to something better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not scientific, only my own experiences and opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For a couple of years in my life I lived in New England and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; met many people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who went private schools, to chi-chi college prep schools and then to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Harvard-Dartmouth-Yale and such colleges (this was my exposure to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different tradition than that to which I was exposed, i.e., a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; middle-class
</em><br>
<em>&gt; West Coast public school life).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And how different did I find the &quot;Top Ten&quot; East Coast crowd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people I'd known before?  Not different at all.  More snooty, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many of the young men spoke with a uniformly affected whiny nasal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inflection - and that very well may have been the biggest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference, right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there.  The private-school crowd were just as smart, and just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as dumb, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone I'd ever known before.  The fact that many of the East 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Coast crowd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seemed to think of themselves as &quot;anointed&quot; compared to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world's population was somewhat vexing to me.  But one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incident, especially,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still stands out in my mind:  I overheard several young wives 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another young wife who stuttered a little (all the respective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wives had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; husbands who were graduate students at Tuck Business School), 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tsk-tsk'g
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about what a liability the wife with the stutter would be for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her husband.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this was a generation ago.  Maybe things have changed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I still don't think private school students get a better education
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared to students who go to public schools, generally.  What is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;education,&quot; anyway?  Maybe children who go to private schools become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culturally deprived, in a way.  I know my own kids benefited from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diversity of people they found in public schools throughout 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years - they've actually expressed this to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Olga
</em><br>
<p>I hope not... my daughter is in a private school (Montessori, not one of
<br>
those weirdy status schools).
<br>
<p>I think you are missing James' point, Olga. I'll give it a go...
<br>
<p>I went through public school. Basically it sucked, but then school does,
<br>
yes? School is school... 30 kids, one teacher, boring presentation of ideas
<br>
performed mind-bogglingly slowly over a course of 13 years. But we survive
<br>
it, hopefully learn something despite it all, and that's that.
<br>
<p>Except that turns out to not be the whole story. As an adult, in the
<br>
situation where my daughter was coming toward school age, I had to make a
<br>
decision about education. My daughter was beginning to read and write at age
<br>
2. So, do I send her to public school (beginning with pre-school), knowing
<br>
what she has in store for her as a gifted kid (wasting many years of her
<br>
life, coming out seriously jaded about institutions, etc). Do I send her to
<br>
a private school, going with the starched collars and snotty attitude, and
<br>
slant her toward the pumped-up prat end of the scale? Or do we home school
<br>
her, and turn her into one of those weirdy home schooled kids (apologies in
<br>
advance, people :-).
<br>
<p>It turned out, after some investigation (fueled by an inspired experience
<br>
with a private pre-school) that there is more to private schools than meets
<br>
the eye. The problem is with the Australian connotations of &quot;private school&quot;
<br>
(means over-privelaged snotty little twerps). When I applied the more pure
<br>
(libertarian? good grief) sense of &quot;private&quot; to &quot;private school&quot;, I
<br>
discovered that it just meant an educational institution run by someone else
<br>
than the government.
<br>
<p>It turns out that there are (some few) alternatives in education going down
<br>
this path. We've picked Montessori as a best fit for my daughter - excellent
<br>
academic orientation, not too much marching up and down the square, no
<br>
uniforms, treats kids like humans (rare!). 
<br>
<p>Not that I'm suggesting this is right for everyone. The point is that
<br>
different methods of education exist, and that they can be right for
<br>
different people.
<br>
<p>So I've come to a point where I strongly support the availability of private
<br>
schooling. The one problem I have with it is that it is so expensive (even
<br>
when it's as cheap as they can manage). And I agree with the libertarian
<br>
crowd (gosh again) that state funded public schooling is much of the
<br>
problem. 
<br>
<p>Basically, we pay our taxes, some of which pays for school, and can either
<br>
get free, under-resourced schooling from the state, under the homogenous
<br>
state education system, or we can pay for school *again* to get private
<br>
schooling. This seems to have bred a system where we have two classes of
<br>
schooling; either spend stupidly large sums of money to get choice, or take
<br>
what you are given, no choices. Thus, the major groups of schools available
<br>
are private, status oriented schools, which parents seem to choose for the
<br>
same reasons that they might buy a BMW, and public schools, indifferent
<br>
inflexible institutions that most of us have had to put up with. There are
<br>
also catholic schools (which I don't know anything about), and then a very
<br>
small (very small!) group of fringe private schools which exist because
<br>
their founders and the parents of their students think education is so
<br>
important that doing it well is necessary, even if that means bearing
<br>
unreasonable costs.
<br>
<p>Actually, I think the private schools here do get state funding as well,
<br>
although I'm not sure of the level of funding. But what I'd like to see is
<br>
funding available such that a private school could be set up to provide
<br>
&quot;free&quot; education, relying on the same level of funding that public schools
<br>
receive; not glamorous, I'm sure, but able to do things differently to the
<br>
norm. Also, there could be a whole slew of alternatives available, which
<br>
would go from costing parents a little bit extra, up to costing a whole lot
<br>
extra.
<br>
<p>I think I'm proposing something different to James, which is that I think
<br>
the public school system should probably be privatised, while government
<br>
funding remains intact. But what we are both saying is that the decision to
<br>
fund only a single style of school, &quot;public schools&quot;, makes it very
<br>
difficult for alternatives to exist, unless the target market of those
<br>
alternatives are not sensitive to price (or in fact use the price as a
<br>
status symbol).
