<p><p>Actually, the report looks like simply someone's words who has
<br>
been there.  We shure don't have any fabrication or semantically
<br>
inflammatory wordings around here.  No siree!   
<br>
<p>Every protest I have done has been a pacifist protest with the
<br>
protesters trained in resisting violence without being violent
<br>
if it occurred. 
<br>
<p>I have seen cops attack.  I have never seen people attack others
<br>
from pot, mushrooms or other hallucinogens.  They are all
<br>
worthless as &quot;battle drugs&quot; as any child of the sixties knows
<br>
full well.  Now heroin is a horse of a different color.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The behavior of the protesters as I've described is INTENTIONAL, btw. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a standard tactic taught at protest boot camps like those run by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ruckus Society and other groups. Their entire purpose is to push the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police to the point where the police strike back in self defense and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frustration. Once one incident occurs, they then run rumors down the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; line of women getting beaten, raped, etc etc etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Similarly, the protest organizers pass around drugs to protesters that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are mood altering: pot with high THC and low CBD levels, mushrooms and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other hallucinogens. Use of these substances is well documented to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective as battle drugs (they were used against the British
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successfully at a key battle against the Zulu in the 19th century,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wiping out a superior force with nothing but clubs and spears, and drug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crazed warriors). The use of these drugs helps to raise up the battle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fever among protesters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Uh, uh.  I don't think much pot is employed by Zulus and
<br>
definitely not acid.  They may have some kind of hallucinogen
<br>
that is good for warfare but the one's commonly used in the west
<br>
don't measure up at all.
