<br>
<p>Understanding Middle Eastern Sources of Violence Against the United
<br>
States
<br>
<p>Steve Niva, The Evergreen State College
<br>
<p>In the wake of the immense and sickening tragedy of the recent attacks
<br>
it is difficult to get beyond the horror and shock of what has just
<br>
happened and engage in some reflection on the sources of violence
<br>
against the United States.  This is understandable given the almost
<br>
unbelievable nature of this attack.  Yet it is more necessary than ever
<br>
if one is to cope with the tragedy and try to find ways to make sure it
<br>
will never happen again.
<br>
<p>What we will see in the next few days and weeks will be investigations,
<br>
arrests of individuals and intense speculation about which groups or
<br>
states did this and how the United States should respond. Unfortunately,
<br>
if the pattern of past responses to such attacks is repeated, we will
<br>
probably not learn a great deal about the reasons behind why this attack
<br>
happened, or the broader sources of violence against the United States
<br>
over the past decade.
<br>
<p>We are hearing substantial reports of a Middle Eastern connection to
<br>
this attack and media coverage has frequently mentioned the name of
<br>
Osama bin Laden as the number one terrorist suspect and mastermind of
<br>
this operation.  If this evidence is verified, it is extremely important
<br>
to gain clarity about the specific actors and their motivations before
<br>
one can even think about how to respond.  For Americans who like their
<br>
hero's and villains portrayed in simple dichotomies of good and evil,
<br>
the result of this kind of clarity could be disturbing because the
<br>
United States has created many enemies through its policies in the
<br>
Middle East over the past century and bears a significant amount of
<br>
responsibility for creating a fertile soil for anti-American hatred.
<br>
<p><p>Who is behind the attacks?
<br>
<p>The recent attacks are most likely related to an escalating series of
<br>
attacks and bombings on U.S. targets over the past 10 years, including
<br>
the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in which
<br>
hundreds were killed.  This attack followed a 1996 car-bomb attack on a
<br>
U.S. barracks in Dharahan, Saudi Arabia that killed 19 Americans and a
<br>
1995 car-bomb attack on an American National Guard Training center in
<br>
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and, of course, the 1993 World Trade Center
<br>
truck-bombing.
<br>
<p>All of these attacks have been attributed to Islamic radicals based in
<br>
the Middle East and Central Asia under the rubric of a very hazy notion
<br>
of &quot;Islamic fundamentalism.&quot; Indeed a number of people from these
<br>
regions with links to certain militant Islamic groups have been arrested
<br>
and charged in some of these actions.  Breathless reports of a shadowy
<br>
Islamic conspiracy against the U.S. have generated a steady stream of
<br>
cliché's about this new enemy and its hatred of the U.S., but
<br>
unfortunately precious little light has been shed on understanding why
<br>
this is happening and what exactly these people believe.  Their enmity
<br>
towards the U.S. is explained as little more than the product of a
<br>
fanatical and inherently anti-Western and anti-American world view.
<br>
Stephen Emerson, a so-called terrorism expert who frequently appears in
<br>
the media, claims that &quot;the hatred of the US by militant Islamic
<br>
fundamentalists is not tied to any particular act or event.  Rather,
<br>
fundamentalists equate the mere existence of the West-its economic,
<br>
political and cultural systems-as an intrinsic attack on Islam.&quot;
<br>
<p>Any explanation of Middle Eastern violence that relies upon the notion
<br>
that Islam is an inherently violent or inherently anti-Western religion
<br>
is false and misleading.  First, Islam is one of the world's largest and
<br>
most diverse religions and like Christianity or Judaism there are
<br>
thousands of views within Islam about the religion and also about
<br>
violence and the West.  Secondly, there are major differences even among
<br>
explicitly Muslim militants and activists regarding these issues-some
<br>
insist upon non-violent struggle and others regard violence as a
<br>
legitimate tool.  There is no way one can generalize about Islam or any
<br>
religion for that matter.
<br>
<p>So who are the perpetrators and what drove them to carry this horrendous
<br>
act?  The most likely perpetrators of these attacks are related to an
<br>
extremely small and fringe network of militants whose motivations do not
<br>
derive from Islam so much as from a common set of experiences and
<br>
beliefs that resulted from their participation in the U.S. backed war
<br>
against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in the 1980's.  These militants
<br>
were recruited by the CIA, the Saudi Arabian and Pakistani intelligence
<br>
services to fight against the Soviet Union during the 1980's.  They came
<br>
largely from the poor and unemployed classes or militant opposition
<br>
groups from around the Middle East, including Algeria, Egypt, Palestine
<br>
and elsewhere in order to wage war on behalf of the Muslim people of
<br>
Afghanistan against the communist led invasion.
<br>
<p>Among the many coordinators and financiers of this effort was a rich
<br>
young Saudi named Osama Bin Laden, who was the millionaire son of a
<br>
wealthy Saudi businessman with close contacts to the Saudi royal family.
<br>
He was considered to be a major CIA asset in the war against the Soviet
<br>
Union.  After 1984, these groups started building major bases in
<br>
Pakistan and Afghanistan and fought against the Soviet Union.
<br>
<p>This network of conservative Sunni Muslim militants, who became known as
<br>
&quot;the Afghans&quot;, also served another purpose for the U.S. and its allies
<br>
in the region.  Not only were they anti-Communist they were also opposed
<br>
to the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran that had toppled a major ally of
<br>
the U.S., the Shah of Iran, who had helped control the oil fields in the
<br>
region under U.S. hegemony.  They opposed the revolution because Iranian
<br>
Islam is based on the Shiite branch of Islam that differs in important
<br>
ways from the major Sunni branch of Islam.  The clear aim of U.S.
<br>
foreign policy was to kill two birds with one stone:  turn back the
<br>
Soviet Union and create a counter-weight to radical Iranian inspired
<br>
threats to U.S. interests, particularly U.S. backed regimes who
<br>
controlled the massive oil resources.
<br>
<p><p>The failure of U.S. policy in the Middle East
<br>
<p>But this policy has now turned into a nightmare for the U.S. and has
<br>
likely led to the recent attacks against the U.S. in New York and
<br>
Washington D.C.  After the Soviets were defeated in Afghanistan in 1989
<br>
this network became expendable to the U.S. who no longer needed their
<br>
services.  In fact, the U.S. actively turned against these groups after
<br>
the Gulf War when a number of these militants returned home and opposed
<br>
the U.S. war against Iraq and especially the U.S. ground troops placed
<br>
in Saudi Arabia on the land of the Islamic holy sites of Mecca and
<br>
Madina. In the past decade there has been a vicious war of intelligence
<br>
services in the region between America and its allies and militant
<br>
Muslim groups.  Many Egyptian Islamists believe the U.S. trained
<br>
Egyptian police torture techniques like they did the Shah and his brutal
<br>
Savak security police. The CIA has sent snatch squads to abduct wanted
<br>
militants form Muslim countries and return them to their countries to
<br>
face almost certain death or imprisonment.
<br>
<p>The primary belief of this loose and militant network of veterans of the
<br>
Afghanistan war is that the West, led by the United States, is now
<br>
waging war against Muslims around the world and that they have to defend
<br>
themselves by any means necessary, including violence and terrorism.
<br>
They point to a number of cases where Muslims have born the brunt of
<br>
violence as evidence of this war: the genocide against Bosnian Muslims,
<br>
the Russian war against Chechnya, the Indian occupation of Kashmir, the
<br>
Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands, the UN sanctions against Iraq
<br>
or the US support of brutal dictatorships in Algeria, Egypt or Saudi
<br>
Arabia, for example.  They claim that the US either supported the
<br>
violence or failed to prevent it in all of these cases.
<br>
<p>It should be clear that this network is only a very radical fringe of
<br>
militants who have decided that they must use armed tactics to get their
<br>
message out to the U.S. and others.  They have been identified as the
<br>
major players in the recent string of anti-U.S. bombings across the
<br>
Middle East that culminated in the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa and
<br>
now, possibly, the attacks directly on American soil.
<br>
<p>They are very different from the wider current of Islamic activism in
<br>
Arab world and more globally which in addition to its Islamic
<br>
orientation has an agenda about social justice and social change against
<br>
the dictatorships and terrible economic conditions and extensive
<br>
corruption in many of the pro-Western countries in the region.  They are
<br>
anti-Iranian.  They are now anti-Saudi. And their actions have even been
<br>
condemned by very militant Muslim organizations ranging from the Muslim
<br>
brotherhood in Egypt to the FIS in Algeria to HAMAS in Palestine.  They
<br>
are disconnected from these movements in many ways although some
<br>
sentiments are certainly shared.  There is no question that the U.S.
<br>
support for Israel and its support for the devastating sanctions on
<br>
Iraq, as well as U.S. support for brutal dictatorships across the
<br>
region, have created a fertile ground for sympathy with such militancy.
<br>
<p>Osama bin Laden is not the mastermind of these attacks as is often
<br>
claimed in the media; he just facilitates these groups and sentiments
<br>
with his money and finances, as do others. He is simply a very visible
<br>
symbol of this network and the U.S. obsession with him most likely works
<br>
to increase his standing as an icon of resistance to the U.S.
<br>
<p>The rise of this militant network and their adoption of violence against
<br>
the United States represents a clear failure of U.S. strategy in the
<br>
region, especially the U.S./Saudi/Pakistani model of alliance between
<br>
conservative Sunni Islamic activism and the West.  The problem is that
<br>
US has no alternative political strategy because they see all Islamic
<br>
activists as their enemy and refuse to address the root causes of
<br>
anti-American sentiments in the region, especially support for
<br>
dictatorships and rampant poverty among the majority of the region's
<br>
masses of people. Just as important, the U.S appears to have no
<br>
long-term strategy to address the sources of grievances that the radical
<br>
groups share with vast majority of Muslim activists who abhor using
<br>
violent methods that would include a more balanced approach to the
<br>
Israeli/Palestinian conflict, ending the sanctions on Iraq or moving
<br>
U.S. military bases out of Saudi Arabia.
<br>
<p><p>How to truly defeat terrorism
<br>
<p>Many of us accept the premise that terrorism is a phenomenon that can be
<br>
defeated only by better ideas, by persuasion and, most importantly, by
<br>
amelioration of the conditions that inspire it. Terrorism's best asset,
<br>
in the final analysis, is the fire in the bellies of its young men. That
<br>
fire cannot be extinguished by Tomahawk missiles or military operations.
<br>
If intelligent Americans can accept this premise as a reasonable basis
<br>
for dealing with this threat, why is it so difficult for our leaders to
<br>
speak and act accordingly?
<br>
<p>The present U.S. strategy for ending the threat of terrorism through the
<br>
use of military force will very likely exacerbate these problems. When
<br>
innocent U.S. citizens are killed and harmed by blasts at US embassies
<br>
or bases, the U.S. government expects expressions of outrage and grief
<br>
over brutal terrorism.  But when U.S. Cruise missiles kill and maim
<br>
innocent Sudanese, Afghanis, and Pakistanis, the U.S. calls it
<br>
collateral damage.  Many of the world's 1.2 billion Muslim people are
<br>
understandably aggrieved by double standards.  The U.S. claims that it
<br>
must impose economic sanctions on certain countries that violate human
<br>
rights and/or harbor weapons of mass destruction.  Yet the U.S. largely
<br>
ignores Muslim victims of human rights violations in Palestine, Bosnia,
<br>
Kosovo, Kashmir and Chechnya.  What's more, while the U.S. economy is
<br>
propped up by weapon sales to countries around the globe and
<br>
particularly in the Middle East, the U.S. insists on economic sanctions
<br>
to prevent weapon development in Libya, Sudan, Iran and Iraq.  In Iraq,
<br>
the crippling economic sanctions cost the lives of 5,000 children, under
<br>
age five, every month.  Over one million Iraqis have died as a direct
<br>
result of over a decade of sanctions. Finally, the U.S. pro-Israel
<br>
policy unfairly puts higher demands on Palestinians to renounce violence
<br>
than on Israelis to halt new settlements and adhere to U.N. resolutions
<br>
calling for an Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian lands.
<br>
<p>There is no justification for the horrendous attacks on innocent
<br>
American civilians in New York or Washington. Yet, at this difficult
<br>
time, Americans should critically examine policies with which Arabs,
<br>
Muslims and many others have legitimate grievances. Why do we refuse to
<br>
see the flaws in these policies? Is it easier to demonize those in the
<br>
Arab world who oppose them as a way of diverting attention from our own
<br>
mistakes?
<br>
<p>President Bush and others have labeled all Islamic militants as members
<br>
or &quot;affiliates&quot; of the &quot;Osama bin Laden Network of Terrorism.&quot; This is,
<br>
of course, the common mistake of demonizing one individual as the root
<br>
of all evil. In fact, elevating bin Laden to that status only gives him
<br>
a mantle of heroism now and, more ominously, will guarantee him
<br>
martyrdom if he should die.  Even if he is killed or captured, the
<br>
fertile soil that creates such figures will still be there. Moreover,
<br>
any attacks may simply serve to inflame passions and create hosts of new
<br>
volunteers to their ranks.  Military solutions to the problems in the
<br>
Middle East and the terrorism that has resulted from these problems is
<br>
not a policy but a recipe for more violence and bombings.
