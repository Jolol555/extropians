Harvey &amp; Mike -- I'm sorry but I just don't buy the article at all.
<br>
Having been written about by the &quot;press&quot; and having had such writings
<br>
contain nothing but half-truths and statements that could *easily*
<br>
have  been corrected with 5 minutes research, I challenge the entire
<br>
article.  There are no concrete references in it so you cannot check
<br>
anything it says.
<br>
<p>As Harvey points out, the companies have a policy (with at least
<br>
some crops) that some fraction be planted with non GMO crops to
<br>
diminish the probability that resistance will develop.  We don't
<br>
know what the policy was in this specific instance (it tends
<br>
to vary on a crop by crop basis).  I'd be more likely to suspect
<br>
that any suits that took place took place because the farmer
<br>
didn't follow a contract they might have had with the supplier.
<br>
We already know of *lots* of examples where such contracts
<br>
(planting/processing &quot;instructions&quot;???) haven't been followed
<br>
(either by the farmer or by downstream grain processors).
<br>
<p>I *really* doubt a corporation would sue a farmer if he had
<br>
a field contaminated with cross-pollinated seed.  That is the
<br>
last thing that they would want to draw attention to.  Farmers
<br>
also do not generally (yes I realize I'm making a generalization
<br>
here) harvest their own seed and reuse it.  Generally they purchase
<br>
it from a seed supplier.  I'd suspect more likely the seed supplier
<br>
may have mixed up some bags.  This gets back to the whole corn
<br>
contamination problem we had a year or two ago.  The only way
<br>
one might avoid this in the long run is to make the corn seeds
<br>
a different color so you know when you are seeding, harvesting
<br>
or buying a GMO plant.  It also makes the occurrence of
<br>
cross-pollination a bit more obvious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the start of the article it seems as if its written by someone
</em><br>
with an &quot;agenda&quot;.  Newspaper reporters can have &quot;green&quot; perspectives
<br>
and slant their articles that way by selective reporting of the facts.
<br>
You would need to find and study the actual lawsuits involved to
<br>
understand the facts of the cases.
<br>
<p>I do know that the seed manufacturers have been buying up the
<br>
seed distributors for a number of years.  I'd view this as
<br>
nothing more than vertical economic integration that is not
<br>
uncommon in any other industry.  Whether it is a good idea
<br>
from an anti-trust perspective is a different question --
<br>
but I doubt its a useful strategy from a corporate perspective
<br>
of trying to &quot;force&quot; farmers to buy GMO seed.  Even thinking
<br>
about it for 30 seconds, any corporation would know that farmers,
<br>
*can* grow their own seed if they want to, so the idea of
<br>
forcing them to buy GMO seed would seem to be invalid from
<br>
the start.  The web sites that I have visited show GMO seed
<br>
and non-GMO seed being sold on the same page so I don't think
<br>
one can make the case for companies trying to force GMO seed
<br>
on the farmers (the fact that the companies have policies of
<br>
growing both GMO-seed and non-GMO seed to delay the development
<br>
of resistance genes means that non-GMO seed isn't going to
<br>
&quot;disappear&quot; from the market).
<br>
<p>I don't think any discussion of the article can be useful without
<br>
knowing the real facts of the cases involved.  I don't get the
<br>
sense that that was what the author of the article was trying
<br>
to present.
<br>
