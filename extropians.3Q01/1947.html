</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; rendering a judgement on the moral question and helping to produce social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conformity, but in working to turn the moral question into nonsense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Fault is irrelevant.  Creating a world we most wish to inhabit
<br>
is what is relevant.  This include taking care of the
<br>
inhabitants, including making the most room for them to take
<br>
care of themselves but not necessarily limited to that.   
<br>
<p>Moral questions are difficult.  That doesn't mean we can afford
<br>
to put them of until &quot;come the Singularity&quot; any more than we can
<br>
wait for all things to be resolved &quot;in heaven&quot;. 
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 2)  To the extent that the disruption you postulate is being produced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient but not hard-takeoff AIs, a rapid-producing Friendly AI would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not care about green pieces of paper, or even vis own welfare,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except as means to an end, and would be expected to approach philanthropy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather differently than humans.  Possibly one of the few plausible paths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a minimum guaranteed income without the need for government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     This scenario is highly implausible due to the expected Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dynamics, and I mention it purely so that I can't be accused of &quot;blowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off a possible problem&quot; just because it's a Slow-Singularity scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, sorry, but that is not the world we live in now.  It
<br>
sounds like you are still &quot;preachin' the sweet by and by&quot; to
<br>
me.  How will we get to Singularity is this pre-Singularity
<br>
world rips itself apart?  How will we ready ourselves for the
<br>
Singularity if we refuse to think of what it means and what we
<br>
wish to create now and within it?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 3)  To the extent that the disruption you postulate is being produced by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard takeoff, I don't expect any problems as a result; quite the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposite.  A nanotech-equipped Transition Guide is perfectly capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; giving poor people as well as rich people what they want, if in fact the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transition Guide would even notice the difference, which is unlikely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (&quot;Notice&quot; in the decisionmaking, not perceptual, sense).  Under the Sysop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scenario, everyone gets an equal piece of the Solar System, again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disregarding as utterly irrelevant any existing Earthbound wealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inequities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically, I don't see a minimum guaranteed income as being necessary or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desirable at any point in the next decade if the Singularity occurs in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2010; we don't yet have enough ultraproductivity to blow off the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production drop introduced by the incentive change of an MGI system, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't expect to see that pre-Singularity.  I don't expect the Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be delayed until 2030, but if it is, I'll be doing what I can on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; near-human Friendly AI side of it in the meanwhile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do you know how much we spend on HEW now?  It is quite huge. 
<br>
This isn't necessarily money that we don't already collect.  
<br>
<p>What exactly is going to lead humans to understand work in a
<br>
world of abundance they are not accustomed to?  Just the SI
<br>
divvying up the solar system and telling us what will be?  Do
<br>
you really think that can work?
