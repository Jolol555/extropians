<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; 2 - The primary purpose of GAC is to build a fitness test for
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; GAC to babysit a truly evolving artificial consciousness, rewarding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; and punishing it as needed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Hard edges don't give you a useful fitness gradient. I'm curious as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;this particular decisions.
</em><br>
<p>People are asked to respond in binary, but what GAC stores is actually a
<br>
continuous variable from -1 to 1 that is based on the probability of a
<br>
human responding true to that item.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; 3 - The key to evolving anything is the fitness test. If I want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; evolve a picture of the Mona Lisa, then I need a fitness test for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Mona Lisa. A good fitness test for the Mona Lisa would be a copy of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; image of the Mona Lisa. To rate the quality of an evolving picture, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; would just need to compare pixels. The next best thing to using an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; image would be a random sample of pixels; the larger the sample, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; better will be the evolved copy. Right now, GAC is a 350,000+ term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; fitness test for humanness. At each one of those points GAC knows what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; it should expect it were testing an average human, because for each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; one of those points GAC has made at least 20 measurements of real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Random online geek is hardly comparable to a CyClist.
</em><br>
<p>No, but they are just as human and MUCH less expensive. Between Open
<br>
Mind and Mindpixel we've essentially duplicated the core effort of CYC's
<br>
15 year effort in less than 1 year and for millions and millions of
<br>
dollars less cost.
<br>
<p>You can have a team of nearly zero smart people for a very large amount
<br>
of money, or a very large team of average people for nearly zero money.
<br>
The big team will always produce more data, and if you do you statistics
<br>
right, it will be of higher quality. As well, the data is framework
<br>
independent - you can process it however you choose - you can even
<br>
revalidate with expensive experts if you chose. Whatever.
<br>
<p>The big advantage of building a big dataset is that with enough data,
<br>
you can use automatic programming to generate and test millions and
<br>
millions of potential frameworks. This is much more effective use of
<br>
resources than paying a bunch of specialists to handcode a single
<br>
framework.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; 4 - Any contradictions in GAC are real contradictions in us. It can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; believe anything that hasn't been confirmed by at least 20 people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; 5 - GAC is science. Over 8 million actual measurements of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; consensus have been made. There are at least two other projects that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Yes, I contributed about 100 of them. I was trying, but both the absence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of domain allocation and leads and the procrustian nature of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;submission data made 99% of that pure crap. I suspect the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;contributors fared little better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; claim to be collecting human consensus information - CYC and Open Mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; - neither has actually done the science to verify that what is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; their databases is actually consensus human fact. It's all hearsay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; until the each item is presented to at least 20 people (central limit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; theorem.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Dunno, both your methods are obviously flawed, and your attitude does seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to have a few problems. Mindpixel is miles away even from Cyc, which at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;least was done by a number of smart, experienced experts, using a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;comparatively rich framework.
</em><br>
<p>You can use any framework you like. But the core ontologies are binary
<br>
rules in all cases, including CYC. But CYC's rules aren't science - they
<br>
are conjecture, which I think is a problem.
<br>
<p>A way of thinking about the whole Mindpixel approach is to think of
<br>
signal processing: Think of complex thought as being like a complex wave
<br>
form and binary propositions being like component sine waves - you even
<br>
get to use the same math, which is very, very cool. And quite telling as
<br>
well.
