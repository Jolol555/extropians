<p>FWIW, my friend who works for Ron Paul in D.C. says they're expecting the
<br>
bill to have a much more difficult time in the Senate. Again, I urge all US
<br>
voters to make phone calls to your Senator.

</em><br>
<p>Absolutely. I'm always distressed by the cavalier way many Extropians treat
<br>
conservation and environmental issues.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We need people who can reconcile
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes. In order to successfully communicate, one must speak in a language the
<br>
audience can understand.
<br>
<p>I think it would also be useful to distinguish between issues that have no
<br>
relevance to transhumanism, and those which are crucial. Some political
<br>
issues--racism, for example--are crucial (if anyone on the list doesn't
<br>
agree, please say so, and I'll explain my reasoning). Others--whether or not
<br>
an ideal society should have corporations, for example--may be interesting,
<br>
but they don't warrant heated arguments.
