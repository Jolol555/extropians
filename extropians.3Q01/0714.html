<em>&gt; &gt; ...just that people, when they think more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positively,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seem to recover from illnesses more quickly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe that's because negative thinking is a symptom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of illness?
</em><br>
<p>Could be. I can tell you the last time I had the flu,
<br>
if someone had tried to cheer me up I would have been
<br>
quite displeased. I wonder if it explains what someone
<br>
had said earlier about sick people not attending
<br>
church--who the hell wants to go be with people when
<br>
they're ill?
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, organic chemistry is a marvelous thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neuropsychopharmacology and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pharmacogenomics are fascinating specialities. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blue pill and the red pill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a la The Matrix) control the chemical processes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human brains very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differently. Nothing mystical about it though. Has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do with hormonal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balances and brain chemistry.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is what I was thinking but couldn't get it
<br>
out--had to pick up my sick son from school. Sorry. He
<br>
doesn't want to be around people right now. Hmm.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I had the placebo effect in mind ealier when I
<br>
mentioned people having positive thoughts and being in
<br>
better health. 
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right! Think positively: We _can_ debunk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religiosity!
</em><br>
<p>Ha! Maybe someday. Unfortunately I would think it is
<br>
as hard to debunk something that is based on blindness
<br>
and the unprovable as it is to prove the basis for the
<br>
religious beliefs. When you argue with a strident
<br>
christian, you get a lot of, &quot;well god said it and I
<br>
believe it, so it is the truth. It's here in the
<br>
Bible, see? There's YOUR proof.&quot;
<br>
<p>That's hard to refute because they don't listen, only
<br>
fight with nonproofs. It is based on irrationality for
<br>
the most part. Talking snakes and magic apples?
<br>
Mushrooms, maybe. Yet we are encouraged to believe in
<br>
Santa CLause and Easter Bunnies and Great Pumpkins
<br>
until we reach a &quot;certain age&quot; and then it is
<br>
&quot;debunked&quot; for us by adults. These same adults tell us
<br>
to believe in a god we can't see and in results we
<br>
can't see. At least we could see Santa and the Easter
<br>
bunny, regardless that they were actors. No one
<br>
dresses up and masquerades as god that I know of, only
<br>
satan for halloween.
<br>
<p>I am sure this has all been said, but I wonder if
<br>
anyone has addressed childrearing in this type of
<br>
home. It continues to confound my children, whom I
<br>
have raised questioning and challenging people, and
<br>
given them the choice to believe or not. I never took
<br>
them to church but did not indoctrinate them with
<br>
atheism either. I encouraged study of &quot;belief systems&quot;
<br>
instead so that they are never taken in by any cult of
<br>
lies. This has made it hard.
<br>
<p>Other parents have a handy answer--the Bible--and I do
<br>
not. My road has been very tough, especially trying to
<br>
maintain peace with other parents. My daughter's
<br>
boyfriend's parents always hate her because she is not
<br>
a &quot;christian&quot;. I would feel sorry for her except that
<br>
I know she is fortunate in many ways. She will join
<br>
this list or one like it someday and know she is not
<br>
alone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Stay hungry,
</em><br>
<p>Yes, yes, yes. Always! :)
<br>
