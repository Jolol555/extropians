<p>Home ownership associations and deed restrictions, voluntarily accepted, are

fine. I doubt you've ever built or substantially remodeled or restored a
<br>
building, or you'd be aware of the numerous hoops one has to jump through to
<br>
satisfy state and local building codes. These codes often require that a
<br>
person hire licensed roofers, plumbers, electricians, etc. to do the work,
<br>
rather than allowing the building owner to do the work herself. The codes
<br>
require such things as central heat and air conditioning, electrical outlets
<br>
every x number of linear feet, specific approved wall coverings and siding,
<br>
etc. etc. They often prohibit the use of inexpensive construction methods
<br>
such as straw bale (which, incidentally, is more resistant to fire than
<br>
standard balloon framing construction).

<p>Hey Jerry, I'd advise you to check it out a little more thoroughly before
<br>
you put money on your bet. You ever tried sleeping under a bridge? Not a
<br>
very secure place to sleep. Easy place to get beat up, raped, have all your
<br>
stuff stolen. Cold in winter. Wet when it rains.
