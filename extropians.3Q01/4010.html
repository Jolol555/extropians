<em>&gt; &gt; Ultimately, we need to take back control of our lands and our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; repective First World govt's. The citizenry rightfully own and control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these lands.  In the end, it will only get worse unless we have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bunch of leaders, and take back control of our govts. I suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology as a means of control.  Instrumentation and monitoring is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what we need. Cameras, etc.... Also, massive constitutional amendments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the USA, and similar measures in Europe.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that more free immigration, rather than more restrictions on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the movement of people, is consistent with the Extropian Principles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropians see people as a positive thing, and are intent on &quot;growing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pie&quot; of over-all wealth, rather than trying to make state-enforced rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that exclude participation in it.
</em><br>
<p>I'd differentiate between restricted immigration, free immigration and
<br>
qualified immigration. I want people to immigrate who are going to take
<br>
citizenship seriously, and are memetically 'bought in' to the constructs
<br>
of a high trust society with a limited republican government. I get
<br>
entirely sick of the hue and cry for the mobocracy that is touted by so
<br>
many immigrants as 'better' than the system we have now, and don't want
<br>
any immigrants who will keep trying to turn this country into the same
<br>
sort of craphole they escaped from. I don't care what country they come
<br>
from and what ethnic, racial, or religous group they are members of. If
<br>
they buy in, they are welcome. If they don't, they can stay where they
<br>
are at.
