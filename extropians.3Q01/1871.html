Typo corrections...
<br>
<p>...
<br>
&quot;might&quot; fit an extropian profile, but none are sufficiently doubt
<br>
resistant that I can make &quot;case closed&quot; assertion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^...a strong
<br>
<p>...
<br>
Ground: The Inside Story of the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Race&quot;
<br>
in which a few people actually people died, and the 2nd richest
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^XXXXXX^
<br>
<p>Gotta try to be self-correcting or I'm sure the list editors
<br>
will mis-mail the corrections to the list for me...  :-;
<br>
<p>One thing I forgot to mention is that Greg has a clear opportunity
<br>
here.  First create a list of radical techno-genetic-meme trashing
<br>
books then as a counterpoint create a list of logical-practical
<br>
anti-luddite books.  Given how Amazon is cleverly linking the
<br>
list overlaps to each other, it is going to have to tweek people's
<br>
meme-sets if they investigate carefully and discover him as
<br>
the author of both lists.  Or he could create two identities:
<br>
&quot;Greg Burch&quot; and &quot;Greg Anti-Burch&quot; and then list them
<br>
as &quot;Amazon Friends&quot;...
<br>
<p>Of additional note -- Amazon is conducting a &quot;great experiment&quot;
<br>
in meme-sharing *and* reputation-building probably previously
<br>
untested in the history of the human race (100,000+ &quot;reviewers&quot;!)
<br>
Now the interesting thing will be whether they decide to taint it
<br>
by attempting to make money off of it (e.g. Book or list authors
<br>
can put spin control on their inclusion/order for $$$)...
<br>
<p>Also of interest is discovering that one frequent Extro-list
<br>
contributor has an Amazon &quot;wish-list&quot;.  It gave me a lot of pleasure
<br>
today to knock a few items off the list.
<br>
