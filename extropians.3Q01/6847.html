Samantha Atkins replied to Christian Szegedy:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Don't thank me. It was not me who decided to assist in kicking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the ass of one of the poorest and misarable country on earth. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who said we are going to do that? And how exactly do you think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they got so poor and miserable? Could it have something to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the extremist fanatic government that is running them into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Stone Age all by itself? 
</em><br>
<p>It could have. So?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They should have thought of this before sheltering bin Laden 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and before setting up a government that would lead them to ruin.
</em><br>
<p>It is naive to think that the people in Afghanistan has &quot;set up&quot;
<br>
this government. In fact, it was the USA that originally supported
<br>
muslim extremists and bin Laden against the Sovietunion. Whithout 
<br>
the help of US, they would have probably never came to power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No one begs for war. But it is good to admit when war has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively been declared on you and you are under attack and to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act accordingly. Anything less would be illogical and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suicidal. Such would definitely not be at all extropic.
</em><br>
<p>It was NOT a war. It was a terror attack. The frustration of the
<br>
American nation lets it become a war. Americans can't accept that
<br>
such significant loss could have been caused by 19 criminals. They 
<br>
want revenge not instead of justice and punishment for those 
<br>
responsibles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps you don't want the responsibility of acting strongly.
</em><br>
I don't want to take the responsibility to act irrantionally,
<br>
harmfully, out of sheer revenge. Anyway, my responsibility is
<br>
quite negligible: it is only to express my opinion as well as 
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Do you really believe that this is the proper way you to eliminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrorism 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think there are any better choices. If you do then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please offer them. 
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps, I was not clear. I am not against the violance against the
<br>
terrorists, but only against pointless violence. The first reaction
<br>
of Bush was very reasonable and appropriate: hunt down and punish those
<br>
responsible. I believe that commandos and attacks against the terrorist
<br>
training centers and the shelters of terrorists are desirable.
<br>
<p>I am afraid of pointless destruction which will harm mainly civilians,
<br>
but not the responsible ones, triggering a positive feedback chain
<br>
of destruction and violence which may cost even more American lives
<br>
than the tuesday tragedies.
<br>
<p>Punishing those responsibles may prove difficult and unspectacular,
<br>
but using conventional warfare methods against a whole country is
<br>
straightforward and much more satisfactory to those who want to
<br>
take revenge.
<br>
<p>I think, there is a main problem in todays politic and warfare: it is
<br>
based on an old tradition which protects mainly politicians:
<br>
commandos and assassinates against the rulers is considered to
<br>
be bad and terroristic, whereas genocide against whole nations and
<br>
a lot of civilians is a &quot;fair war&quot;. This is rooted in an old belief
<br>
that some life is more valuable than the others: kings must not 
<br>
be killed. (You can see the manifestation of this in the chess also:
<br>
cehckmate is allowed, but taking the king is not...)
<br>
I would measure the morality (desirability?) of solutions on their
<br>
effectivenes in saving lives. If killing a dictator or a the head of
<br>
terrorists costs less lives, then it is more moral (desirable) than
<br>
any traditional war or &quot;fair&quot; war.
<br>
<p>Of course retaliation also saves lives if it punishes the right people.
<br>
Therefore, it can be a moral solution.
<br>
<p>Slaughtering innocent people in sake of revenge not just unmoral, it is
<br>
counterproductive. It would turn against us the whole muslim world,
<br>
which would end up in a pointless religion war resulting in several 
<br>
million deads, just according to Osamas plans.
<br>
<p>I would say, I agree with Eliezer thoughts:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If Afghanistan is breeding terrorists, then I think it's acceptable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to go in with a ground war and remove the Taliban from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power, even if civilians and involuntary draftees are killed. Not so much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of the World Trade Center, but to delay the day when terrorists 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquire and use weapons of mass destruction. I don't think I could agree 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a retaliatory air strike unless it's followed by a ground war to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permanently remove the offending government from power. Rogue states are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destabilizing forces in the years leading up to the Singularity. Removing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them from existence and discouraging other states from going rogue is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worthwhile endeavor. It's pointless to hurt the civilians of the country 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose government supported the terrorists that hurt our civilians. 
</em><br>
<p>I am only afraid of the technical part: Afghanistan is a huge country
<br>
being in war for 23 years. It consists mainly of mountains: partizans
<br>
have a lot of adventages. They resisted Soviets 10 years long and
<br>
there are awfully lot of people who have experience in fighting,
<br>
are fanatic and have not much to loose. To fight those people would
<br>
be extremely hard.
