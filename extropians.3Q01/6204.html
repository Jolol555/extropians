<em>&gt; &gt; Already US officials are talking of full blooded retaliation and &quot;Acts of

</em><br>
<p>Glad you point that out. Exactly the kind of manipulative, expedient
<br>
US foreign policy that helps foster the kind of hatred that leads to acts
<br>
like Tuesday.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Retaliation of course will make much of the population of the US feel good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But will guarantee yet another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cycle of internecine conflict. Unfortunately i cannot envisage the current

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I hate to say it but I don't see how any other course of action

</em><br>
<em>&gt;without a lot of extra unneeded vengeance and saber-rattling.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But it should be made very clear that no group can do things

</em><br>
<em>&gt;because we fear more attacks.  We must act if we fear more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attacks and act to lessen their likelihood by taking out key
</em><br>
<em>&gt;players who could launch such an attack.
</em><br>
Yeah i completely accept the need for some form of armed response, perhaps 
<br>
i have
<br>
given ppl the impression than i am a pacifist ..... which i most definitely 
<br>
am not.
<br>
I just hope the response is measured and precise. Lets not forget the 
<br>
mistakes in
<br>
the Serbia then the Chiness Embassy was bomb based on dubious or even 
<br>
deliberately
<br>
misleading intelligence, the Serbia mistake is not the only bombing 
<br>
intelligence fubar we've
<br>
seen resently. I believe a Libyan buisnessman is currently suing the US for 
<br>
destruction of his
<br>
toothpaste factory during an attempted &quot;Bin Laden hit&quot;.
<br>
<p>The last thing the US ( indeed the world ) needs is to get lead into a 
<br>
disastrous public
<br>
relations mistake, by being lead by the nose into bombing a bunker full of 
<br>
sick children.
<br>
Based on questionable intelligence.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But where did all this come from, lets be frank. Acts like this do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spring up in isolation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Many years of nee-jerk support of Israel's warts and all policies in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; region, combined with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pointless willingness to be confrontational with Middle Eastern nations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Has resulted in the USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Mid-East situation is much too complex for simplistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;analysis. And many of those Middle Eastern nations were quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;confrontational with us, with one another and with our allie
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Israel from the get-go.  Some of their governments are run by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religious fanatics who consider jihad a sacred duty.  Some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them seek to wipe Israel off the map and consider us the Great
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Satan.
</em><br>
<p>( First i should say and should have in my initial post. All these comments 
<br>
are
<br>
predicated on the assumption of some form of middle eastern Muslim connection
<br>
to Tuesdays events. )
<br>
<p>Well to be far i did stress in other areas that those are not the ONLY 
<br>
cause of the
<br>
situation.
<br>
<p>I have to admit Sam this is exactly the kind of perspective that helped 
<br>
cause the
<br>
problems, on both sides. A rather arrogant sense of cultural superiority, 
<br>
making open
<br>
engagement almost impossible.
<br>
We have had a similar situation in the UK Northern Ireland. Once again 
<br>
historic grievances that
<br>
have never been properly addressed. Communities split by both culture and 
<br>
religion. And the seizing of
<br>
a chunk of someone else's Nation in order to secure our own citizens. ( 
<br>
bizarrely N.I Protestants
<br>
are actually descended from Scots )
<br>
Now am sure many Americans take a much more lenient view of the struggle 
<br>
for a unified Ireland.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Not that we haven't done some slimey or at least very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;questionable things in the region over the years.  But nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that justifies this kind of attack and nothing that should stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us from finding and stopping the attackers.
</em><br>
<p>Thats not what am saying, what i am saying is that ppl bomb and maim because
<br>
the feel unjustly treated and ignored. And in many cases they have a point 
<br>
in regards
<br>
of the unjust and ignored.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; These of course are not the only contributory factors, they are however the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ones that IMHO most US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; citizens will choose to ignore. Which is almost certain recipe for another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; full cycle of violent retribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on both sadly misguided sides.being regarded as International enemy #2 in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the eyes of much of the Muslim world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What full cycle?  The terrorist groups (very finite number)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capable of such attacks will either be stepped on or severely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;curtailed one way or another.  From that point on where are such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;full attacks likely to come from?
</em><br>
<p>With dozens of pockets of Muslim poverty and religious fervor dotted around 
<br>
that region.
<br>
Average family sizes of 5-6 children. do you really see the terrorist 
<br>
organizations
<br>
running short of manpower any time soon. Because if it was that easy am 
<br>
certain that
<br>
Israel would have used that option.
<br>
<p>By cycle of violence i mean young Muslim boys and men sat watching the 
<br>
events on Tuesday,
<br>
noting the pride and the status the &quot;dead martyrs&quot; garner within their 
<br>
community. Making a decision
<br>
that they too would like to grow up to be such a man.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Add to this mix Muslim nations with a suspicious attitude to US motives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Religions and cultures that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; find much of the others distasteful or repugnant. Many pockets of Muslim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; poverty, ignorance and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strict adherence to a perceived fundamentalists credo. And a sense amongst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; many Muslims that the West
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the US in particular would never support one of their causes no matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how just.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Blasting the shit out of US territory is not the way to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;support for any cause.  That message must be loud and clear.
</em><br>
<p>Thats the kind of thing lots of ppl do when the feel they have been 
<br>
unjustly treated and ignored.
<br>
Many Americans should familiarize themselves with the number of times
<br>
the US has blocked moves in the UN to sanction Israel for various actions 
<br>
in the region.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Please don't for one second imagine that i am in any way justifying actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such as the ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; committed today. My own dear sister was probably saved, only by the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that rather than working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in one of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's WTC offices, she now works in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Braodway offices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However i do feel that ignoring the elements that have help to shape the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perspectives of the ( suspected )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perpetrators, is not the best way to sech a long lasting solution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The terrorists will be taken out first.  Then we can work on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;settling long range tension with the more reasonable parties.
</em><br>
<p>Like i said previously i only wish it was that easy.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Humans are rather nasty violent primates, with huge propensity for ignoring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the suffering of &quot;others&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this i know from experience, but we have to change at some point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I agree.  But giving the message that you will not defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yourself or strike back regardless of what comes is not a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good idea at an international level.  Human groups just don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work that way.
</em><br>
<p>I don't beleive i once advocated a &quot;non-armed response&quot; policy, what i would
<br>
like to see is some form of engagement with the issues in that region too.
<br>
Without that this kind of thing could and probably will happen again.
