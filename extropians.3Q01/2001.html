Wow, Mike. You have so much hate in you.
<br>
<p>Some guy named Brent Glass writes something in which he claims to 
<br>
understand what is going on in Richard Stallman's mind, and since you 
<br>
already believe him to be some nasty commie type you happily accept that 
<br>
and rail against him.
<br>
<p>I have met Richard Stallman personally and spoken with him and had email 
<br>
discussion with him. I can't say definitively that his reasoning wasn't as 
<br>
you say (heavens! I have a hard enough time saying what my girlfriend's 
<br>
motivation is from day to day) but I don't think you can seriously dismiss 
<br>
him like that.
<br>
<p>You only need to speak with him for a little while to see that he genuinely 
<br>
believes that closed source software is harmful, not only to the individual 
<br>
and society but to the software industry itself. Sure the GPL ensures that 
<br>
if you use GNU software in your own code then you must not lock up the 
<br>
source. That removes people's freedom to truly use that which they have 
<br>
paid out good money for. Yes, it is a hardline attitude; he is an idealist.
<br>
<p>The Open Source movement (Bruce Perens, Eric Raymond, etc) softened their 
<br>
approach because of the poisonous attitude of many people who could not 
<br>
understand the benefits of opening up the source code to all. They have 
<br>
produced much less absolute licenses. Richard Stallman views that as giving 
<br>
away people's freedoms in little bits. I personally like it as a good 
<br>
transitional way to introduce the general community to open source -- 
<br>
eventually the idea of secretive software will be generally seen as 
<br>
backward-looking and damaging to all.
<br>
<p>This guy Dave Avery you quote below is a misinformed nut. GPL doesn't hold 
<br>
a gun to anyone's head or extort anything from anyone. Nobody forces anyone 
<br>
to use GPL programs. There are plenty of other programs out there under 
<br>
different licenses. But if someone gets a program, particularly one that 
<br>
doesn't cost them anything, as with many GPL programs, then the proper 
<br>
thing to do is to at least abide by the license of the person who created it.
<br>
<p>Plenty of people make good, honorable livings out of open source programs 
<br>
-- yes, even GPL'ed ones.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Miriam

<em>&gt;Open Source - Says Who?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by Dave Avery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; GPL - Sounds Good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  The two most common source code licenses are GPL and BSD.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  GPL stands for General Public License. GPL supporters (like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  LINUX crowd) often talk about how nice and open they are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  and that they'll give you their code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  This sounds nice, and like they are sharing freely, but be sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  to look this gift horse in the mouth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  I think of it like this -- GPL code is &quot;open&quot;, but it has cooties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  If their code ever touches yours, your code has cooties too,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  and thus has to be shared with the world (whether you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  to or not).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  You can use this code, if and only if you agree to the terms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  which includes giving up all rights to anything you produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  that ever got near their code, and that your code will carry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  the GPL license around as well since it will be distributed with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  their code. If you have any part of your code that you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  to keep private or you consider intellectual property, then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  can't easily use GPL. In other words, it's all or nothing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  So with GPL you don't have a choice to share. You have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  someone with a gun telling you to share or else. Some call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  that open, others call it extortion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Better Share Dance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  On the other hand, BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution, a.k.a.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Berkeley UNIX) is far more open and basically says that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  can use the code in whatever way you want, but please be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  nice and give back. Not that you have to give back, and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  that you will be hunted down and flogged if you don't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  You don't even have to sign away rights to any code that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  ever got near a BSD license.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  If you want to truly give or get something without conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  (or with fewer conditions), then the BSD license is far better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  BSD is giving -- GPL is bartering (at best). BSD takes the high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  road and trusts you to share, and assumes that you're a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  person and that you'll give back. GPL takes the low road,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  assumes that you are a bad person, and that the only way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  get you to share is with force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  But be careful about stating this publicly or you will get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  thousands of angry e-mails from annoyed purists who think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  that the end justifies the means, and GPL is a good way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  force others to be as free and open as they are, or else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;end quote...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't understand your hatred of the guy. He is an honorable (if somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; impatient) person, with an incredibly sharp mind. In many ways the computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; industry owes him a debt. Open-source is revitalising the industry. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; secretive industry would have ended up suffocating itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Open-source existed before Stallman, and was destined for its present
</em><br>
<em>&gt;place if Stallman never existed. The only reason Open-source has become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as big as it is is because of Linus Torvalds. If GPL didn't exist, he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would likely have placed linux under BSD instead of GPL, and people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would still be as psyched about open source, and there would be far less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;low trust commie types running roughshod over the motives of anyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;didn't agree with them in the movement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Look, Linus screwed up. He put linux under GPL as an idealistic kid, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time in life when most of us think we are commies for various spans of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time, and then grow out of it at faster or slower rates than others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Most of us try to rationalize away any bad things we did in the name of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our commie ideals during that period. Very few are willing to openly say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;hey, I screwed up, I'm sorry&quot;. Human beings are rationalizing creatures
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that way, and we don't want to be bad people. Linus was not aware of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;original reasons why Stallman wrote the GPL any more than American 60's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hippies (or the atomic spies like Fuchs and the Rosenbergs) were aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the heinous crimes of Stalin (I'll leave aside the interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phonetic similarities....), so blaming Linus for anything, or looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;negatively at his accomplishments is wrong. That doesn't mean we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shouldn't rationally and honestly admit what Stallman did and why he did
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's illustrative that GPL is a low trust contract, while BSD is a high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trust contract. I think its rather obvious, based upon my other writings
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on this list, which one I prefer and is more useful toward building true
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freedom in software.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Besides just BSD, there is also MIT X which pre-exists Stallman, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which does not have its punitive characteristics. Brett Glass also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;illustrates the problems with not only the GPL, but the new LGPL, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is supposed to be called the 'Libary General Public License' for use in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cloning Windows under the Mono project, but it's indicative of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Stallman's true sentiments that he calls this the 'Lesser General Public
</em><br>
<em>&gt;License'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As Brett Glass writes:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.osopinion.com/perl/story/?id=12037">http://www.osopinion.com/perl/story/?id=12037</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Born Free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  If the actual goal of Mono is to provide freedom, it should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  license its libraries (and other components) under a truly free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  license, such as the MIT X license, which allows commercial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  development and commercial reuse of code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  To do so would demonstrate that Mono is not motivated by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  vendetta against Microsoft (or against more ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  commercial developers), but rather by a spirit of true freedom.
