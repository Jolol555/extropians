<p>Nestle's *WHAT* in Africa?
<br>
<p>[30 second pause.]
<br>
<p>No, I've never heard of it, and neither has Google.  Nestle + child +
<br>
murder... nothing.  Nestle + Africa... nothing.  Nestle + murder...
<br>
nothing.
<br>
<p>[2 minute pause.]
<br>
<p>Okay, I spoke too soon.  Putting a lot more effort into finding dirt on
<br>
Nestle turns up an allegation that Nestle gave away baby formula for free
<br>
to mothers in developing nations until their milk dried up, then started
<br>
charging them.
<br>
<p>I found it difficult to believe any corporation could be that stupid, even
<br>
in the 1970s, although Monsanto recently came close.  But it also seemed,
<br>
if perhaps legendary, like the kind of legend that often has a remote
<br>
basis in history, and besides, I know that the 1970s are not my own time
<br>
and that they used to do things differently back then.  So I did a bit
<br>
more digging.
<br>
<p>What actually happened?  As far as I can tell from using Google, Nestle
<br>
identified the Third World as a major market for baby formula. 
<br>
Unfortunately, baby formula doesn't work quite as well in the developing
<br>
world.  Baby formula is supposed to be mixed with pure water and delivered
<br>
in bottles with sterile rubber nipples.  In the third world, pure water
<br>
was the exception rather than the rule; likewise sterilization. 
<br>
Furthermore, because baby formula was relatively much more expensive
<br>
compared to income, mothers were tempted to &quot;stretch&quot; the powder, diluting
<br>
it and degrading the nutritional value.  Activists were outraged and
<br>
alleged infant fatality cases; this being the 1970s, Nestle told them to
<br>
take a hike.  It eventually took a coordinated international boycott to
<br>
get Nestle to sign a paper agreeing not to market infant formula in the
<br>
Third World.  Nobody knows how much effect the boycott had commercially,
<br>
but it was a public relations nightmare for Nestle.
<br>
<p>And the other side of *that* story...
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.womensfigures.com/januarynews.html">http://www.womensfigures.com/januarynews.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Politics doesn't only affect medical care in the U.S., but also in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Africa.  A chilling Wall Street Journal article on December 5,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2000, exposed how proposed donations of baby formula by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nestle and Wyeth to Africa to stop the spread of AIDS are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being thwarted by UNICEF.  The article described how African
</em><br>
<em>&gt; babies face AIDS infection through breastfeeding by their sick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mothers.  Since the beginning of the AIDS crisis, 3.4 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; babies worldwide are estimated to have been infected by their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mothers, more than half of them through breastfeeding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UNICEF supports breastfeeding for mothers in Africa, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says that mothers with AIDS should be informed of the risk of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infecting babies and told of alternatives.  However, most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIDS-infected mothers are extremely poor, and can hardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afford to buy milk in the store, let alone a 1 lb tin of formula
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costing $6.00, as it does in Uganda.  For such mothers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information about alternatives is no use without free formula: if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they don't breastfeed the babies, they will die of starvation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why can't Wyeth and Nestle donate formula to low-income
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mothers?  In the 1970s corporations marketed formula to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mothers, giving out free samples which supposedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discouraged breastfeeding.  Activists protested, leading the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations to sign a 1980s agreement, imposing a ban on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the donation of formula.  This agreement was put in place long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before the AIDS epidemic was ever envisaged.  But today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; African babies are paying the price, because UNICEF will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alter the agreement, even in cases of dire need.  For example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in July, 2000, when formula supplies in Nsambya Hospital in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uganda ran out, Nestle offered to donate 4.4 tons.  The offer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was refused, and women were told to fend for themselves.
</em><br>
<p>Moral of the story:  Never trust a single source.  That is just so
<br>
pre-Web.
<br>
<p>...and this all shows the failure of capitalism *how*?
