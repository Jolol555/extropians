<p><p>I more agree with Steve.  Unlike the detective, which there are
<br>
relatively few of and which are more avoidable,  ubiquitous
<br>
electronic survelliance and recognition software is nearly
<br>
impossible to avoid.  The level of power this gives an
<br>
autocratic state is staggering and quite worrisome.  A lot of
<br>
freedom is protected by
<br>
the high cost and difficulty of enforcing uniformly the State's
<br>
demands.

<em>&gt; &gt; Many people would object to the [some of the] hypothetical

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that what people objected to was the way that the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; against people.  I have to concede one of your main points:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; namely, that in the question as to how much governments can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be trusted, the burden of proof lies on those who say they can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Of course.  Produce only enlightened leaders or fully protected
<br>
republics where the politicians cannot run amok and then we will
<br>
happily talk of perfect and perpetual survelliance and such.
<br>

<p><em>&gt; &gt; It's interesting to speculate how people would react
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if we did get a transparent society with effectively constant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; surveillance, a kind of society wide panopticon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I liked David Brin's book &quot;The Transparent Society&quot; which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealt very well with this whole issue.  It's very controversial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Extropians as well as everywhere else, however.  Although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some very reputable thinkers believe that the government or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rich will always have the upper hand---and this will just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make it worse---I was persuaded by Brin's arguments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps we'll all start behaving like the inhabitants of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Big Brother house :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I greatly enjoyed listening to Arthur C. Clark and Stephen Baxter's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The Light of Other Days&quot;, which picks up on an idea of Clark's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from Childhood's End:  a history machine is created that allows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universal surveillance not only of the present, but of all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history too.  Maybe it would be as bad as Big Brother (as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Orwell fan, I sure hate this usurpation of the term), but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think that I would act any differently if I knew that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of posterity would have access to my life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>But you would act a great deal differently if you knew that you
<br>
and those you care about could be punished drastically for
<br>
state-decreed wrongs that are not wrong or that your descendants
<br>
could and would be punished in the future for your actions in
<br>
the past.
