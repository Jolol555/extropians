<p><p><em>&gt;Well, what I don't understand why, if restricting your ability to yell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fire in a theater is a legally regulatable, that restricting the ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the media to bias the election cannot be similarly regulated. Our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right to vote, after all, is the lynchping of our entire system, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing else should be allowed to interfere with the individuals right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to make their own decision. Liberals are always eager to talk about how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the courts are there to ajudicate boundary overlap of different rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In this case, the media's free press rights overlap the rights of every
</em><br>
<em>&gt;voter to vote equally, unbiased by outside influences outside of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;persuation on party platforms, etc. Which is to be considered greater? I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say the right to vote is more important.
</em><br>
<p>Mike, I think this is a very reasonable and arguable position. I might 
<br>
accept a well-drafted and narrowly confined law along the lines you propose, 
<br>
for similar reasons to those you propose.
<br>
<p>However, it is an example of the problems that arise when we try to analyse 
<br>
problems in terms of &quot;rights&quot;. My view is that &quot;rights&quot; don't exist.
<br>
<p>I'm not talking here of legal entitlements or of the kinds of constitutional 
<br>
principles that are often called &quot;rights&quot; (though they are often no such 
<br>
thing, merely limitations on legislative power). There are good and clear 
<br>
reasons why the legal norms in any society include entitlements, ie rights. 
<br>
But I am saying that, when you analyse what the law *should*, be you get 
<br>
stuck with ethical analysis that depends on trying to reconcile peoples' 
<br>
ultimately subjective (if heavily overlapping, given the similarities of our 
<br>
genes, overall existential condition, etc) ethical commitments and values.
<br>
<p>I think the usual position of libertarians (or at least *a* prominent 
<br>
position that I see in the libertarian literature) is that fundamental 
<br>
(pre-legal) rights *cannot* conflict. I find this highly implausible.
<br>
<p>However, I know you and I have some deep disagreements on all this. I'm just 
<br>
offering you a point of view to think about, as I think about those I see 
<br>
coming from you.
<br>
<p>Best wishes
<br>
<p>Russell
