<em>&gt; &gt; I understand about the word &quot;Mexican&quot; - there's nothing wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with that word per se...
</em><br>
<p>I have in-laws from Mexico who offered this insightful
<br>
view.  They had little contact with Americans growing up in
<br>
Mexico City until the Vietnam war resulted in American draft
<br>
dodgers fleeing to their country.  Altho I would not expect that
<br>
crowd to be representative of Americans, they were the ones the
<br>
Mexicans saw.  Let your imagination fill in the details: young men,
<br>
perhaps relatively poor and unskilled, since the richer draft
<br>
agers were at the university, perhaps wearing &quot;colorful&quot; clothing,
<br>
their hair and beards may have been a bit unkempt from their
<br>
travels, etc.  The Mexicans developed a very bad attitude about
<br>
Americans.  Even the word American came to be considered a
<br>
derogatory term.  When my in-laws' daughter started dating one,
<br>
their reaction was understandably OH por faVOR!
<br>
<p>Since then, the daughter married my brother-in-law, he turned
<br>
out to be a decent chap, they moved to Los Angeles and now
<br>
the families have a better attitude.  {8-]  spike
