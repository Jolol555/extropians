<em>&gt; Think about this for a minute. This means that the only real means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ensuring that passengers are not armed is to strip and cavity search
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every airline passenger.
</em><br>
<p>This will probably be done in terms of a surface penetrating radar that has
<br>
been in evaluation for a couple years.  People will walk through it and it
<br>
will see everything under your clothes, plastic and ceramic knives and even
<br>
personal details - curvature of breasts.  
<br>
<p>Think about this:  Pilots are now having their razorblades and tweezers
<br>
confiscated from their kitbags.  Swiss Army knives, a former requirement for
<br>
them to carry are now banned.  The people who are responsible for keeping
<br>
you alive for 1-13 hours during your flight are being disarmed and made
<br>
helpless.
<br>
<p>Think about this:  Ground crews - baggage handlers, food service employees,
<br>
etc. DO NOT GO THROUGH SECURITY AND DO NOT GO THROUGH METAL DETECTORS.  This
<br>
is information is from a family member who's a commercial pilot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Think about the implications: since it is therefore impossible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent all passengers from being armed unless we choose to live in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; big brother police state, we MUST have armed people on every flight.
</em><br>
<p>Read the following:
<br>
<p>&quot;It seems clear that billions of dollars for metal detectors and ID
<br>
checks have proven ineffective in stopping terrorism.  Villains
<br>
always manage to get weapons and always seem to get them through
<br>
security checkpoints.  Despite this obvious fact, many voices are
<br>
now calling for Americans to give up more of their freedoms.  What
<br>
we really need is to instigate procedures that will serve as a
<br>
deterrent to terrorists.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>H.R. 2896 Will Arm Pilots
<br>
<p>For example, Gun Owners of America is calling upon Congress to
<br>
immediately adopt self-defense legislation that was introduced on
<br>
Friday by Republican Representative Ron Paul of Texas.
<br>
<p>Paul's bill (H.R. 2896) will overturn existing laws and regulations
<br>
that prevent pilots from carrying sidearms onto planes.  Rep. Paul
<br>
believes that armed pilots could save the lives of thousands of
<br>
individuals.
<br>
<p>&quot;It would be a mistake,&quot; Paul told Gun Owners of America, &quot;to
<br>
respond to last week's terrorist attacks by punishing the American
<br>
people with more infringements on their liberties.
<br>
<p>&quot;We don't need more intrusive government.  We need freedom.  Freedom
<br>
saves lives, and my bill is a modest step towards letting pilots
<br>
defend their lives and the lives of their passengers -- not to
<br>
mention the lives of thousands of innocent people who may be working
<br>
in office buildings.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is imperative that gun owners let their Congressman and Senators
<br>
know that they support this common-sense legislation.
<br>
<p>ACTION:  Urge your Representative to cosponsor H.R. 2896, which
<br>
allows pilots to defend the lives of their passengers.  Please use
<br>
the prewritten text below to help direct your comments to your
<br>
Representative.  You can call your Congressman at 202-225-3121.  To
<br>
identify your Representative, as well as to send a message via
<br>
e-mail, see the Legislative Action Center at
<br>
