</em><br>
<p>Yes, as I wrote the above, I was afraid that my &quot;common sense&quot; would
<br>
be misunderstood.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah, then you might read Alan Cromer's UNCOMMON SENSE for another opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He develops a Piagetian analysis of why science is really quite difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and massively counter-intuitive.
</em><br>
<p>The elaboration of any kind of reasoning can result in enlightenment,
<br>
and the abandonment of earlier views, often even of common sense and
<br>
the intuitive.  But the greater danger by far is to assume that, as
<br>
you wrote, &quot;science is really quite different&quot; from our ordinary thinking.
<br>
It's not.  But believing that it is leads immediately to the cult of
<br>
scientism, wherein only the practiced and degree-sanctified priests
<br>
have the established authority to pass judgment on their arcane
<br>
subject matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Plainly we mostly approach the world on the basis of evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dispositional templates that, in conjunction with cultural memory,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create our *folk physics* and *folk psychology*, etc: the usual ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans tend to negotiate our *Lebenswelt*. One element of folk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics or plain common sense gives us the wrong answer if we ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so simple a question as which bullet falls to the ground first,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one dropped straight down or one fired horizontally above a level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plain at 1 km/hr.
</em><br>
<p>Quite right.  But even Galilean physics is counter-intuitive, at 
<br>
least until one has built up the right intuitions (Galilean physics
<br>
is an advance over most folk physics).  Galileo himself used to argue
<br>
the fact that heavy bodies fall no faster than light bodies (which is
<br>
non-intuitive) by suggesting that we imagine two light bodies
<br>
connected by a string.  So eventually, even quantum mechanics
<br>
becomes an almost second nature, and is used instinctively by
<br>
the practiced (though we still have to give some credence to
<br>
Feynman and others who insist that nobody really should feel
<br>
entirely comfortable with it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note that I'm not equating scientific methodologies with voodoo or
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment can indeed produce science, but the outcome isn't `common' sense.&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but have you ever seen a counter-intuitive chess combination?  And of
<br>
course we are treated every week to Colombo or some other sleuth solving
<br>
a baffling mystery by daring conjecture and the Holmesian &quot;when you have
<br>
eliminated the impossible, what remains, no matter how implausible, must
<br>
be the truth&quot;.  I think that we should emphasize whenever possible that
<br>
scientists employ reasoning processes no different than those of doctors,
<br>
detectives, architects, and plumbers.
