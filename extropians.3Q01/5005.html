<br>
<p><em>&gt; Please humor me and my ignorance of the details involved, I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask a lot of questions in trying to understand the situation.
</em><br>
<p>It's really neat when someone is able to write such a statement
<br>
with total sincerity and no sarcasm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, they live in kleptocracies. But they suffer the abuses, instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefitting from them. Given that, I can't imagine why would they feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inclined to create a kleptocracy in the US. They may lack a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophisticated political ideas and practice, but they should be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognize kleptocracy is a no win game for them.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that despite the annoyances with the unfamiliar, many
<br>
immigrants do appreciate the improvements in the new country
<br>
that they've chosen in contrast to the old country.  It's 
<br>
definitely not the case that there would be an *intention*
<br>
to create corruption or devalue the institutions of liberty.
<br>
What is of concern is that such eventualities stem from the
<br>
basic culture of a people.  For example, what if the particular
<br>
kind of religiosity of a people have a great influence on the
<br>
patterns of government that develop?  Libertarians systematically,
<br>
by the way, do not appreciate the hundreds of years that it took
<br>
(mostly) English speaking people to evolve democratic traditions
<br>
and the habits that support them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, how would the uneducated peasants keep you from enjoying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryonics?
</em><br>
<p>There must be something deeply antithetical in Mexican culture
<br>
towards cryonics.  While a number of Spanish (people from Spain)
<br>
eagerly embrace cryonics (for some unknown reason) there no
<br>
Mexican members of American cryonics organizations, so far as
<br>
I know.  Thus Mexican voters would not be at all offended, I
<br>
fear, when other parts of the American political system decide
<br>
that the cryonicists are using up valuable resources needed by
<br>
society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I thought those of them that are illegals wouldn't be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vote or such, and those who can, well I just can't see them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worrying much about the issue one way or another...
</em><br>
<p>Well, amnesty will be announced for all, of course, as it was
<br>
before.  That's just a question of time.  And votes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again, this can easily become for said peasants a matter of cost-benefit:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting into the US seems certainly lots cheaper, both on an individual and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group sense, than headbutting against the kleptocracy and risking all kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nasties (in the worst case) or a lot of wasted time and still being dirt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor (in the usual case). Can you really blame them for doing so?
</em><br>
<p>Certainly not in the sense that I don't understand and sympathize.  Still,
<br>
the illegal ones must be blamed for not obeying the law, or law doesn't
<br>
mean anything.  Of course, there should be stiff prison sentences for
<br>
coming into a country illegally, just as there is in other nations.  But
<br>
again, it's a question of votes, and it may be too late for that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for the political correctness issue, it is a US feature that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm still unable to understand at all, so you don't need to worry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about me thinking you can't criticise them on that account.
</em><br>
<p>No :-)  you are far more likely to become the victim of political
<br>
correctness than to exercise it.  You'll find out soon enough what
<br>
*terms* rather than *ideas* are likely to bring out the PC crowd.
<br>
