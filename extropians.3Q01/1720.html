<p><em>    &gt;At a range of 10,000 miles, you need an accuracy  measured in tiny

</em><br>
<p>Tiny yes infinitesimal no.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; while the  accuracy you need to hit the moon is in many whole minutes of arc
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;accuracy.
</em><br>
<p>If we know were the moon is to an inch and a half we'll know where your
<br>
Deathstar battle wagon is even better. And it's not like I'd only have one shot
<br>
at hitting you. A medium sized rocket could easily carry thousands of
<br>
projectiles each with enough energy to knock out a 65 ton M1 tank. And
<br>
even if you're incredibly lucky and none of them hit you just wait 45
<br>
minutes and you run into the same stuff again.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;and the moon can't maneuver, either... the SBL can.
</em><br>
<p>If this huge satellite is constantly changing its orbit where is
<br>
it getting the fuel to do so? Do you have two shuttle flights a day
<br>
re-supplying it? Or can it detect a grain of sand moving toward
<br>
it at 11 miles a second from such a long distance that it has
<br>
time to jump out of the way?
<br>
<p><em>        &gt; and its easy to make in course corrections with primitive sigting
</em><br>
<em>        &gt; systems when steering for the moon, not so to hit a small SBL target
</em><br>
<p>What?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; you need accurate data piped up from ground stations
</em><br>
<p>We've had that for more than 40 years.
<br>
<p><p><em>    &gt; Essentially, in order to have a system that eliminates the SBL system,
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; you basically need your own SDI capability as well.
</em><br>
<p>What you'd need is a bucket of sand.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Then why are they all so oriented?
</em><br>
<p>What?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Apparently you are not aware of orbital mechanics. Trajectory is
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;dependent upon the mass ratio between the two bodies orbiting each
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; other.
</em><br>
<p>Apparently you are not aware of high school physics. The difference in
<br>
mass between the Earth and the warhead is so huge that you only need
<br>
to consider the gravitational effect of the earth on the warhead and
<br>
can ignore the gravitational effect of the warhead on the Earth.
<br>
True, an anvil and a feather moving at the same velocity In a vacuum  would
<br>
have different orbits, but you'd need an scanning tunneling microscope to
<br>
detect the difference.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; the explosive shock of the balloon material erupting like that
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; would likely cause damage to the IRV unless it is further reinforced.
</em><br>
<p>Of all the silly things said in this thread this must be number one.
<br>
A  warhead tough enough to withstand 500 g's and intense heat as it
<br>
reenters the atmosphere at high angle is going to be damaged by the
<br>
popping of a toy Mylar balloon that weighs about an once! I love it.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; John, don't you remember what you posted last? You said to throw some
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; nuts in the reverse direction of the SBL. That implies a retrograde  orbit.
</em><br>
<p>POLAR ORBIT! East is opposite to west, North is opposite  to South, is this
<br>
really that hard to understand.
