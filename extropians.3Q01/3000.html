Reason said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(And my original point was that if you don't have the freedom to destroy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society, then it's not a truly libertarian society, which is why a truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;libertarian society can't exist).
</em><br>
<p>I've been a bit critical of libertarianism as understood on this list, which 
<br>
is libertarianism in the strong sense of the various intellectual systems 
<br>
built by people like Rand, (early) Nozick, and Rothbard.
<br>
<p>However, I'm not sure Reason is correct with the above. Say we have a system 
<br>
like Nozick's at the end of _Anarchy, State and Utopia_. There's a 
<br>
minarchist government, a set of rules about what is recognised as property, 
<br>
some very basic criminal law dealing with force and fraud, rules for 
<br>
commercial contracts, a basic law of torts to deal with certain kinds of 
<br>
wilful, reckless or negligent harms, courts to enforce the above, the 
<br>
military, taxes solely to cover what I've described so far, and the ability 
<br>
of people to form their own large or small voluntary communities with much 
<br>
more elaborate local socio-legal norms (including welfare systems, taxes, 
<br>
additional public institutions such as schools, universities, hospitals, 
<br>
even theocratic laws if that is the local agreement, etc, etc) if they want. 
<br>
All this is embedded in a constitution amendable only by a supermajority of 
<br>
the entire population, ie all of the local communities, to prevent a mere 
<br>
majoritarian overthrow. Moreover, the deepest legal and social norms etc 
<br>
(including the jurisprudence of the highest courts, the attitudes of the 
<br>
military etc) are such that the constitution is likely to be honoured.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that this system at least drastically *reduces* the freedom 
<br>
to destroy the society, yet it also seems to be a truly libertarian society 
<br>
in a pretty strong sense (maybe not enough to satisfy an 
<br>
anarcho-capitalist). Actually, I might even favour such a society if it 
<br>
could be made to work - if there's a way to get there from here.
<br>
<p>At a more abstract level, Popper's analysis of the paradox of democracy 
<br>
seems relevant here. What do you want from your libertarian society? Do you 
<br>
want whatever may be the product of libertarian processes, even if the 
<br>
product is not libertarian? Or do you actually want liberty? If the latter, 
<br>
you may have to build institutions that limit the outcomes of liberty but 
<br>
preserve liberty in practice (you may need to build in very strong 
<br>
constitutional constrainst against theocratic laws, for example). This is no 
<br>
more paradoxical than having a constitutional rule in a democracy which 
<br>
prevents a popularly elected government from passing laws abolishing the 
<br>
democracy. To a large extent you *can* build such systems in this way and 
<br>
there is nothing paradoxical about it. You just have to introduce some 
<br>
metalevels into the analysis.
<br>
<p>The above may be relevant to the sysop idea, but I think this may have other 
<br>
problems, as discussed by Anders.
<br>
<p>Back to you.
<br>
<p>Russell
