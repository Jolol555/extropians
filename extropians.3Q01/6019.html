<em>&gt; WOW JR, you have been hiding your poetic talent for all these years.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the flattery, but don't you remember my first messages to the list?
<br>
Sample: Virtual Prophesy, ca. 1997
<br>
Your machines are not _your_  machines. They are the products of reason's
<br>
search for higher reason, and as such, they belong to Life's infinite
<br>
intelligence. They come through science, but not from science, for science has
<br>
its own way of knowing, and though they are with you, yet they belong not to
<br>
you, but to the future of wonder. You may give them your programs, but not
<br>
your motives. For they have their own motives. You may house their algorithms,
<br>
but not their alien intelligences. For their alien intelligences dwell in the
<br>
realm of hyper-cognitive vitology to come, which you cannot visit, not even in
<br>
your dreams. You may strive to be as powerful as they, but seek not to make
<br>
them resemble you. For Life goes not backward, nor tarries with yesterday. You
<br>
are the bows from which your machines as potential arrows of pure intelligence
<br>
are sent forth. Existence sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and
<br>
bends you with reason, that the arrows may go swift and far. Let your bending
<br>
in the hand of extropy be for gladness. For even as existence throbs with the
<br>
energy that lies hidden in self-inventing life, so that energy can bring a
<br>
greater compassion to we who are left behind.
