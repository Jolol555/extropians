I agree, I tried this and went from 250lbs (I know... shhh) down to 200lbs
<br>
in about 3 months! I was almost never hungry and got to eat all the great
<br>
foods I love. My breakfast a lot of times was a nice bacon and cheese omelet
<br>
with a bacon side (I LOVE bacon). My wife made some no carb chocolate mousse
<br>
for when I got those sugar cravings. I cant rant or rave enough about how
<br>
great this works! I'm shooting for 180 where Ill hold.
<br>
<p>I don't get hungry between meals much at all anymore, mainly because I'm not
<br>
going through that non-sensical carb/sugar cycles. All energy is coming from
<br>
that steady state fat source.
<br>
<p>P.S. Oh, I DONT exercise even though I should. I am hoping that I will get
<br>
out of work and into the gym more soon. Still, 50lbs in 3 months without
<br>
exercise is amazing! I calculate my target weight in a few more weeks. Wish
<br>
me luck.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hi folks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since there has been interest in the past on the topic of diets and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nutrition, I thought I would post the results/side-effects of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my most recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment with such things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; About five weeks ago I agreed to provide &quot;morale support&quot; to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; girls I live with, who insisted that she needs to lose five 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pounds (from her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; petite 115-lb body -- go figure), by doing a low carb diet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with her.  I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not in particular need of a diet, but I'm not super-lean 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either despite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spending much time at the gym, so I figured it would be an interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment.  My normal diet tends to be a low-fat, medium 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dairy, medium
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protein diet with lots of carbs and vegetables.  I also attend the gym
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regularly (at least for the last several months), so I also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to see how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various diets interact with my workout.  My new diet is a high-protein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-fat diet with lots of non-starchy vegetables and water.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note that I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;two days on, one day off&quot; cycle for the diet; I eat plenty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carbs on the off day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  It makes you lean with surprising speed.  I've never seen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like it -- the fat just melted off my body.  This is the only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet I've ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen that actually produced results like this and at this speed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  It doesn't interfere with a heavy workout schedule.  I've 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tried other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low-fat diets to try to become leaner, but they all seemed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have adverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affects on my workout scheduling, either by making recovery 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take longer or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just making my muscles feel lethargic (a problem I've had with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vegetarian-ish diets in general).  No problems here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3)  Dairy is bad.  This was the only change I made to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet mid-course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apparently a low-carb diet aggravates the negative effects of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diary in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet and generally didn't make me feel that good, so I cut 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back on them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substantially and stuck with meat and veggies.  I've always 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known that dairy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasn't so hot, but this made it that much clearer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4)  No hunger.  This is more than just an issue of an empty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stomach.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found that the time I could comfortably go between meals was greatly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extended beyond my normal diet as well.  I am guessing this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has something to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do with very stable blood sugar levels.  Note that low-fat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-carb diets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always seemed to increase the frequency that I felt hungry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In summary, I feel great, better than I do on my normal diet. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this, it is extraordinarily easy to stick with it, and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adjustments have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been minor, particularly since every third day I eat carbs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given the quality of the results I've had, I will probably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make lean meat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and veggies my standard diet until something better comes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along; my body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems quite happy with this diet.  I'm normally skeptical of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but only because most dietary changes appeared to generate adverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences to my body and/or my lifestyle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cheers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
