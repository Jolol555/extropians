<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;I personally don't understand the trust libertarians in general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;seem to put on &quot;the individual.&quot;  I don't recall reading of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;time in our history (U.S. history) when libertarianism was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;supposedly in bloom, and when peace, prosperity and goodwill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;reigned.  If there was such a time (a better time for citizens in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;the U.S., compared to recent years), I'd like to know when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;that time was.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; As far as the trust issue, I do believe that history shows nation/states
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; being the purveyors of millions of deaths via wars, genocide, etc... Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments ARE a collection of individuals, just given the power of using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legalized force. My question is, why would anyone trust governments given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their history?
</em><br>
<p>Different governments have had different histories -- some good, some bad.
<br>
With the checks and balances system in a democratic society, there is much
<br>
potential for good government.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, the closest we come to a &quot;golden age of libertarianism&quot; is that
</em><br>
period
<br>
<em>&gt; of time here in the IS from the country's founding to about 1900. A nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with nothing but trees, rivers, and rocks was turned into the wealthiest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation of all time! Why didn't this happen elsewhere? What is it that we
</em><br>
had
<br>
<em>&gt; more then anyone else on the planet (don't even try the slave point, other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries had FAR more then we did)? I put forth freedom. Yes, it wasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete, and there were still government distortions of the market, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that was minimal. I recently heard a quote im going to adapt. &quot;Only an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual could evade the fact that countries with more freedom tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be wealthier and more peaceful&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Well, your view is just too ethnocentric.  If you put forth &quot;freedom&quot; as the
<br>
reason, then you must make a case that people were free to enjoy that
<br>
freedom - otherwise, where's the beef?  In the period of time you mention
<br>
women weren't free even to vote - sheesh.  (And, sorry, but the slave issue
<br>
has to be brought up -- remember, the USA was supposed to be a democracy,
<br>
and that makes the America's involvement with slavery that much more
<br>
hyprocritical and shameful).  As well, in many parts of the country Jews
<br>
weren't allowed to live in certain restricted areas - not just until 1900,
<br>
but way into the 1960s.  Freedom?  For whom?  Don't get me wrong, I like our
<br>
democracy - I just think it needs to keep trying to live up to its name.
<br>
Government has helped achieve this more mature and actualized democracy only
<br>
in the past few decades (i.e., the individuals working within our
<br>
government - have achieved more for the common good than our more retrograde
<br>
form of &quot;democracy&quot; has ever achieved in the past).
