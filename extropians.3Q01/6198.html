<p>
&nbsp;Some more or less random thoughts on the events of yesterday.
<br>
<p><p>On the technical/security side:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I think the risk of a repeat attack using the same methods by the same
<br>
group or similar ones is very low.  The 9/11/01 attacks have put a spotlight
<br>
on the gaping security holes that the attackers were able to exploit and
<br>
those holes will now be plugged.  The cost of plugging them WILL likely
<br>
bankrupt a number of airlines, though and, in that, the terrorists will have
<br>
secured yet another victory.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The clues now coming to light will probably provide sufficient leads that
<br>
the surviving members of the cabal that perpetrated the crimes will be
<br>
identified fairly quickly.  I'm guessing that the perpetrators didn't try to
<br>
cover their tracks very hard.  However, I'll bet that the links to bin-Laden
<br>
will be tenuous at best, but nevertheless real.  The scenario I now think
<br>
most likely is that bin-Laden's core leadership cell only generally defined
<br>
the target and methodology and then severed connections to the action cells
<br>
that carried out the attacks under separate and autonomous leadership.  The
<br>
most direct connections will be through funding.  Most like scenario there:
<br>
Autonomous funds set up and access granted ahead of time to the action
<br>
cells, with further contact between the funds and bin-Laden severed.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I've said for years that civil aviation provides one of the primary weapons
<br>
to terrorists seeking to attack the US.  I took no comfort from being proved
<br>
right yesterday as I watched the second impact on the WTC in real-time.  I
<br>
only hope that those whose job is security will be thinking about the other
<br>
scenarios I've imagined.  I won't even describe them here, but they're
<br>
obvious enough to anyone with half a brain.
<br>
<p><p><p>On the political/security front:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I do expect further attacks from similar autonomous cells, invigorated by
<br>
the &quot;success&quot; of the events of 9/11/01.  Thus, we're likely to see a much
<br>
increased impact of security behavior in our lives from now on.  I think the
<br>
fears about this triggering a &quot;police state&quot; are overblown.  My father's
<br>
generation went through the years of World War II with their basic civil
<br>
liberties intact, although temporarily and modestly curtailed during the
<br>
actual conflict.  The diffuse nature of the threat makes comparisons to WWII
<br>
difficult, though.
<br>
<p><p><p>On the political/cultural front:
<br>
<p>The irony of calling on god - the nearly universal reaction of America's
<br>
political leaders - was completely lost on the media.  NONE of the talking
<br>
heads on the tube noted it.  Oh well . . .
<br>
<p>The root problem is not US foreign policy, as some here have suggested.  It'
<br>
s that there is a widely distributed culture of fanaticism in the Islamic
<br>
world.  It focuses on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but it certainly has
<br>
other objects, as well.  Consider that the savagery of the Taliban has
<br>
basically nothing to do with the on-going crisis in the Levant.  Examples
<br>
can be found from Algeria to Indonesia that have nothing to do with
<br>
Palestinian nationalism.  That culture of fanaticism has secured the &quot;sacred
<br>
high ground&quot; throughout the Islamic world.  As a result, there is no secure
<br>
middle ground in politics or culture in the Islamic world.  This is because
<br>
Islamism is truly totalitarian, or &quot;culturally hegemonistic,&quot; to borrow a
<br>
phrase form Marxist rhetoric, i.e. it makes claim to relevance to and
<br>
dominance over every aspect of life.  Contrary to the claims of
<br>
Arab-Americans and others today, and in the days that follow, that the
<br>
9/11/01 attacks don't represent &quot;true Islam&quot;, in fact they do.  They
<br>
represent precisely the aspects of Islam that made it the most successfully
<br>
viral meme in human history.
<br>
<p>And herein lies the ultimate, gut-wrenching irony and threat: Our political
<br>
and cultural leaders cannot condemn this root cause of the problem.  On the
<br>
one hand, it would likely be ineffective.  Condemnation of Islamism would be
<br>
interpreted by Moslems all over the world as the simple rhetoric of
<br>
inter-religious bigotry and ompetition.  In other words, condemning Islam
<br>
for what it is would be heard by Moslems as the same kind of rhetoric that
<br>
has fueled inter-religious wars throughout history, no different than the
<br>
kind of pronouncements made by leaders on both sides of the European
<br>
religious wars of the Reformation.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the modern dogma of cultural relativism makes any kind of
<br>
public judgment of one culture by another impossible.  Any condemnation of
<br>
Islam for the fertilizer of fanaticism that it is would be interpreted by
<br>
the shapers of our own culture as chauvinism.  Thus, our public discourse is
<br>
condemned to a fundamental impotence: We cannot as a civilization even TALK
<br>
about the root cause of the problem.
