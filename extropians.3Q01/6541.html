Christians are making this out to be an attack against Christianity and our
<br>
Christian Nation.  They are already blaming the traditional enemies of
<br>
religion as contributing to this attack.  Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson
<br>
specifically single out gays, feminists, pagans, liberals, abortionists, the
<br>
ACLU, the People for the American Way, and secular government as being
<br>
contributors to this attack.

WASHINGTON, Thursday, Sept. 13 - The Rev. Jerry Falwell said gays,
<br>
feminists,
<br>
&quot;pagans,&quot; and a host of liberal advocacy groups have made &quot;God mad&quot; and must
<br>
share the blame for the terrorist attacks this week that took the lives of
<br>
thousands of Americans at the World Trade Center in New York and at the
<br>
Pentagon outside Washington. Falwell made his remarks Thursday, Sept. 13,
<br>
while appearing on the religious television program The 700 Club, hosted by
<br>
the Rev. Pat Robertson. Falwell and Robertson are among the nation’s
<br>
strongest opponents of gay civil rights. &quot;I really believe that the pagans,
<br>
and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and lesbians who are
<br>
actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for
<br>
the American Way — all of them who have tried to secularize America — I
<br>
point the finger in their face and say, ‘You helped this happen,’&quot; Falwell
<br>
said on the program, which was broadcast nationally. &quot;Well, I totally
<br>
concur,&quot; Robertson told Falwell, &quot;and the problem is we have adopted their
<br>
agenda at the highest levels of our government.&quot;
