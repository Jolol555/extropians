Another good op-ed. Disaffected smart folks are a constituency, too.
<br>
It made me think, and not merely rearrange my prejudices.

<p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/09/14/DD154994.DTL">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/09/14/DD154994.DTL</a>
<br>
<p>PHIL BRONSTEIN, THE executive editor of The Chronicle, sent out a 
<br>
memo Wednesday about emotions. He mentioned that journalists tend to 
<br>
bury their emotions while covering a tragedy, and said this was not a 
<br>
good thing for either the journalist or the journalism. He said that 
<br>
if people were feeling overwhelmed, there was a number to call, a 
<br>
place to go.
<br>
<p>What interested me about the memo was that it did not track very well 
<br>
with my own emotions. I was not feeling overwhelmed or teary; neither 
<br>
was I feeling stoical or brave. I was mostly feeling confused, which 
<br>
is an emotion of the head rather than the heart.
<br>
<p>Of course, I lost no loved ones in the tragedy. I have no close 
<br>
friends who lost loved ones. I am saddened by the tragedy and 
<br>
heartened by the acts of heroism great and small, but in a 
<br>
generalized way. I do not feel less secure than I did three days ago, 
<br>
perhaps because I never feel secure.
<br>
<p>My early life did not have a lot of security in it. I expect the 
<br>
worst in all situations. Every sunrise is a miracle. Every failure to 
<br>
meet violence with more violence is a surprise. Blessed are the 
<br>
peacemakers, because there are not a lot of them and usually they get 
<br>
blamed for everything.
<br>
<p>And I am a child of the media. I was alone a lot as a child, through 
<br>
no fault of my overworked single mother, and my companions were radio 
<br>
and television and books. I learned, for my own sanity, to 
<br>
distinguish between the real world and the media world and to treat 
<br>
them with different levels of seriousness.
<br>
<p>I saw the World Trade Center collapse. I saw the White House blow up. 
<br>
Both of those events were on a television screen. I understand that 
<br>
one was &quot;real&quot; and one was &quot;just a movie,&quot; but I have learned to 
<br>
distrust those distinctions. I have been lied to by presidents and 
<br>
press secretaries and financial experts, but Kevin Kline has always 
<br>
told me the truth. Is a lie about the real world better than the 
<br>
truth about an unreal world?
<br>
<p>I don't know the answer to that question. I know better than to stake 
<br>
my heart on either one. My wife, my children, my parents, my friends 
<br>
-- that is the world in my heart. Everything else is knowledge, 
<br>
speculation, entertainment, art. They go to my brain first, and my 
<br>
brain is a suspicious gatekeeper.
<br>
<p>I distrust facile mourning. I consider it an artifact of 
<br>
manipulation. It is unexamined and disproportionate. On April 30, 
<br>
1991, 139,000 people were killed by a cyclone in Bangladesh. They 
<br>
were mothers and fathers and children; they were heroes and fools and 
<br>
poets and thieves. I recall no candlelight vigils -- indeed, I do not 
<br>
recall the event at all. I had to look it up.
<br>
<p>I imagine the president sent a pro forma letter of regret. I imagine 
<br>
that he did not spend a minute thinking about those people. If human 
<br>
loss is the yardstick by which we measure our pain, we should have 
<br>
the date burned into our brains. It's in the previous paragraph; can 
<br>
you recall it without looking back?
<br>
<p>IAM FRUGAL with my grief because grief can be manipulated. I am 
<br>
seeing the president do it now. This is a cowardly act, he has said 
<br>
again and again, although &quot;cowardly&quot; is exactly the wrong adjective 
<br>
to describe the hijackers. They were brave. It would be good to 
<br>
understand what made them brave. Self- sacrifice is always 
<br>
interesting, since it runs so contrary to our most basic instincts. 
<br>
&quot;Cowardly&quot; would be a good word to describe our waging of the war in 
<br>
Kosovo, or our current bombing runs in Iraq. I am a patriotic 
<br>
American, besotted with the Constitution, but I do not think our 
<br>
foreign policy is wise or just.
<br>
<p>We should retain our privacy now, I think; work on a human scale; 
<br>
remember that a politician is most dangerous when he is announcing 
<br>
that something is &quot;beyond politics.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p>It is best to hide your heart, because the world is full of thieves.
