Wow, Lee you just totally miss the point.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;would anyone have to lie awake at night thinking of the best way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;treat farmworkers?
</em><br>
<p>Ummm... try compassion? good sense? a desire to give a whole underclass a 
<br>
chance to get in the race? to avoid future problems? to build goodwill 
<br>
instead of hate and envy?
<br>
<p>Did you even read the piece Olga posted? Cheryl and Ralph Broetje seem to 
<br>
have found incentive... and many others undoubtedly would like to help but 
<br>
are constrained by the financial system that you speak so highly of -- the 
<br>
very one that you say airily will solve these problems. Olga points out so 
<br>
nicely that it doesn't.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;I think that what is happening, Olga, is that you divine *your own*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;motivations, and find them quite pure.  I agree.  I am certain that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you really do have the best interests of the farm workers in mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But you don't lie awake thinking of it at night.  Instead, just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the rest of us, you lie awake thinking of your own problems, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a horrible mistake to think that a great leader will do any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;differently.
</em><br>
<p>I am sure you don't lie awake at night worrying about these sorts of things 
<br>
Lee, but I wouldn't be so quick to assume that is true of all others. I, 
<br>
for one, *do* lie awake at nights worrying about exactly these sorts of 
<br>
things. How the hell are we going to get anywhere if we can't give fellow 
<br>
humans a hand up out of the places they are stuck in? If we have an 
<br>
enormous underclass when the spike arrives then they will hate us with a 
<br>
fury. How will we be secure in immortality when there are people who can't 
<br>
be certain of eating tomorrow? They would have nothing to lose in taking 
<br>
everything from us. And in a strange way I almost feel they would be right 
<br>
to do so.
<br>
<p>I just know that many will rush to the defense here saying that the spike 
<br>
will make technologies so accessible that poverty will be eliminated, but 
<br>
poverty is only part of the problem, and the spike alone won't eliminate it 
<br>
anyway. We have had the ability to distribute all human knowledge for free 
<br>
to all the priveleged members of society for many years now, but powerful 
<br>
financial pressures have prevented that from happening.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;So all of his wonderful speeches about &quot;benefitting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the people&quot; are mainly power ploys to defeat his adversaries, gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power from the (ignorant) crowds, and ultimately work towards his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;own best interests.
</em><br>
<p>What shit is this Lee?
<br>
Straw man. Very big straw man.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; While supermarket customers' &quot;body language, their shopping patterns, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; most of all, their buying habits&quot; may indeed be worthy of a specialized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; field of study, I'm afraid farmworkers' problems are all pretty much the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134331325_migrantkids19m.htm">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134331325_migrantkids19m.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, their problems *are* just the same.  And your problems remain yours,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and my problems remain mine.
</em><br>
<p>Do you have children Lee? Of course kids don't need to be helped. They 
<br>
should be abaondoned at birth. Their problems are theirs and yours are 
<br>
yours. Heaven forbid that anybody help anybody else.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Nowhere is the need for children's programs more pressing than in this tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; town, population 2,609, where 96 percent of children live in poverty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here is the fatal urge.  You read about some unfortunate situation such as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this, and you want to DO SOMETHING.  (Of course, it's really none of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;business; you actually spend most of your time worrying about your own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*local* problems.)
</em><br>
<p>Oh, how terrible that anybody would consider helping anybody.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;Hence even if it means for a great leader, or the government, to TAKE 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;IMMEDIATE ACTION BY SEIZING ALL ASSETS OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE THAN 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;THEY NEED, you have an immediate sympathy for something, so long as it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solves the problem.
</em><br>
<p>What is it that you have with this demon Lee??? This terrible, nasty straw 
<br>
man that wants to come and seize all your assets. He has no place in this 
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;Look at the words in that paragraph I snipped:  the &quot;need for children's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;programs&quot;, &quot;96 percent of the children live in poverty&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, all sorts of people everywhere in the world and all throughout 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history have **needs**.  We must not focus on the so-called causes of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;poverty, but rather focus on how *anyone* ever escaped poverty.  To find 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out how wealth is created in the first place, one must start with Adam 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Smith, or any thinker who really tries to get at root causes.  Wealth was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*never* created by taxing one sort of people and benevolently bestowing it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on those who have *needs* by means of &quot;programs&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Adam Smith never solved that problem. It remains in spite of many attempts 
<br>
to put his beliefs into practice. He defined a narrow set of rules that 
<br>
might work fine if we were motivated by money alone... but nobody has been 
<br>
able to find that out because we aren't. Until we can formulate ways to 
<br>
manage the *real* world we have to deal with a whole mess of practical 
<br>
patches to fix a multitude of problems.
<br>
<p>It is not clean and doesn't have the crystalline beauty of a simple rule, 
<br>
but little by little humanity *is* rising to a level of intelligence and 
<br>
tolerance through an incredibly complex set of checks and balances that 
<br>
will make the spike possible. Selfishness alone won't do it.
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?

A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
