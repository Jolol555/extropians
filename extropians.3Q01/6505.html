<em>&gt; With the recent integration of eastern european nations into NATO, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will also prove a great opportunity for the newly democratic nations to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forge new martial traditions, to earn the respect and gratitude of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom loving peoples, and to demonstrate a determined commitment to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom in the crucible of conflict that I think we are going to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the next several years.
</em><br>
<p>I can't believe that this is on the extropian list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; with european countries and cultures, and I'm sure that many europeans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are similarly proud of having this opportunity to come to our assistance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the way that we have done for them in the past. For this, I thank
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every european and citizen of a NATO country on the list.
</em><br>
<p>Don't thank me. It was not me who decided to assist in kicking
<br>
the ass of one of the poorest and misarable country on earth.
<br>
<p>I am afraid.
<br>
<p>I have seen a lot of very intelligent and cool headed reaction on the
<br>
list yesterday. What I see today is a lot of nationalist and
<br>
bloodthursty PR. Some want to die for ideas, some are begging for war
<br>
and thank to all Europians to assist. And all this is on the
<br>
extropian list. I don't want to imagine the reaction of the masses...
<br>
<p>Don't misunderstand me. I was shocked by attack from the very first
<br>
minute. I spent a wonderfull evening on the top of the WTC last
<br>
summer, so I could visualize and imagine the extent and cruelty
<br>
of the events. I was thinking over and over again: how could they
<br>
do it? How is it possible? Why could not USA stop them? I am also
<br>
angry.
<br>
<p>But I think revenge leads only to spiralling violence and sorrow.
<br>
<p>I am afraid.
<br>
<p>American only know that they must hit somebody.
<br>
And that they must hit hard.
<br>
But, They don't know who.
<br>
<p>The result will be that they will kill a lot of innocent people
<br>
for an idea. Only because they don't want to seem weak.
<br>
<p>It can only go wrong.
<br>
<p>NATO will kill at least 10000 innocent people, women and children
<br>
in Kabul.
<br>
<p>Of course it is easy. It will be even good for the economy.
<br>
American and European people will cheer and USA will reelect Bush.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, it will generate a lot of people in afghanistan
<br>
who have lost their families, their houses, everything.
<br>
A lot of people who have nothing to loose. Some million potential
<br>
terrorist. 
<br>
<p>Do you really believe that this is the proper way you to eliminate
<br>
terrorism
<br>
<p>Please think about it a bit. Not just pretend!
