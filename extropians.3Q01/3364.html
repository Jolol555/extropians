<em>&gt; &gt;I would like to address the points that Harvey Newstrom made, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;there isn't room in this email.  I wish to say that for a huge number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of otherwise rational thinkers, I am afraid, the statements that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;made above qualify and overqualify me as a racist.  Anyone who thinks so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;please give me a careful analysis---not a one line emotionally driven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rejection or put-down.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem, Lee, is that we are *all* racists.  It is virtually
</em><br>
impossible
<br>
<em>&gt; to have been born and raised in the US without being a racist.  It is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part a social problem and in part an evolved defense mechanism.  The less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like &quot;us&quot; a given person or group of persons is, the more likely we are to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view them with suspicion and caution.  Not necessarily a bad thing in and
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; itself.  But when that instinct is not tempered by a willingness to
</em><br>
consider
<br>
<em>&gt; the possibility that the &quot;different&quot; person is not so bad as our gut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reactions tell us, then our rationality is being trumped by animal
</em><br>
instinct.
<br>
<em>&gt;   A very un-Extropian way to go, if you ask me.
</em><br>
<p>The way some people have chosen to describe &quot;racist&quot; on this list is by
<br>
calling &quot;racist&quot; those  people tending to be compassionate and trying to
<br>
figure out solutions to the problems still plaguing us all as a result of
<br>
legally-sanctioned racism of just a generation ago (e.g., the inimitable
<br>
Mike Lorrey has written &quot;[But] there are different types of racists as well.
<br>
Those who think that someone needs to meet a lower standard just because of
<br>
their skin color to get the same job or to be accepted into college, or
<br>
someone who thinks that someone who is 7 generations separated from their
<br>
enslaved ancestors deserves 'reparations', is themselves a racist&quot;).   Ahem,
<br>
not 7 generations ago, Mikey - granted, hundreds of years of &quot;enslaved
<br>
ancestors&quot; came before 100 years of de jure segregation, but the latter
<br>
practice was alive and kicking a tad over a generation ago.  Not to mention
<br>
that de facto bigotry still exists.
<br>
<p>I realize that trying to get through to Mr. Lorrey is like trying to draw
<br>
blood from a rock, but it occurred to me that in attempting to pose as
<br>
&quot;colorblind,&quot; some people want to have it both ways.  If a person notices
<br>
that our society is not colorblind, well, that's &quot;racist,&quot; you see?   Even
<br>
if our society (made up of individuals, many of whom are bigotted) were
<br>
suddenly to become &quot;colorblind&quot; overnight, that still wouldn't take care of
<br>
the sad legacy we've all been left with.  But the fact remains our society
<br>
(again, consisting of many bigotted individuals) is not &quot;colorblind.&quot;  The
<br>
people who have accused some of us on this list for being &quot;PC&quot; - have
<br>
designed their own libertarian[?] form of &quot;PC,&quot; those clever rascals.  Cross
<br>
it, and you-yourself are a &quot;racist,&quot; you see!  If I may make a CL
<br>
observation, at this point: &quot;...how conveeeeeee-nient.&quot;
<br>
<p>So, certainly, if even so much as noticing that we have a &quot;race&quot; problem
<br>
makes us &quot;racist,&quot; then we're all &quot;racist.&quot;  But then that boils the word
<br>
down to utter meaninglessness.  Dear me, what a conundrum the Mikeys of the
<br>
world have left for us poor bleeding-hearted knee-jerking types.  Be
<br>
concerned about the problem of &quot;racism&quot; in our country - what?  you say
<br>
you're not colorblind? - then you're a racist!   Express a desire to help
<br>
the underprivileged - what?  you say you're not colorblind?  then you must
<br>
be a racist!
<br>
<p>&quot;Colorblind&quot; would work if our society were truly colorblind.  &quot;Racism&quot;
<br>
would not need work if our society were not racist.  But until we are free
<br>
of &quot;racism,&quot; we who are concerned about its problems don't have the luxury
<br>
of being &quot;colorblind.&quot;  And I submit that that's not &quot;racist,&quot; in the
<br>
generally accepted understanding of the word.
