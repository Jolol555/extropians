New Economy: Selling a Vision of the Future Beyond Folders
<br>
By JOHN SCHWARTZ 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The fawning introducers burbled. The rock music blared. And out of the wings 
<br>
of the vast auditorium at PC Expo, New York's glitziest high-technology trade 
<br>
show, walked the computer scientist David Gelernter.
<br>
<p>His stocky frame, mop of curly hair and look of distracted intensity made him 
<br>
seem a little like a lost graduate student, someone who might have wandered 
<br>
onto the stage while looking for the pretzel stand. But by the standards of 
<br>
the computing world, Mr. Gelernter is a rock star. 
<br>
<p>One of the truly certified Smart Guys, he pioneered technologies in the 
<br>
1980's at Yale University that allow computers to collaborate — what is now 
<br>
known by the buzz phrase peer-to-peer computing. He is also an accomplished 
<br>
painter and a writer of fiery social criticism, whose essays and fiction 
<br>
appear in such publications as The Weekly Standard and Commentary.
<br>
<p>Last Thursday on the stage at PC Expo, he was trying to show that he can also 
<br>
be an entrepreneur. Professor Gelernter, 46, founder and chief scientist at 
<br>
Mirror Worlds Technologies, wore a black suit, striped shirt and a tie the 
<br>
color of ancient parchment. He also wore a brown leather glove covering the 
<br>
remnants of his right hand — the most visible of the critical injuries he 
<br>
sustained in 1993 after opening a package sent by Theodore Kaczynski, the 
<br>
terrorist known as the Unabomber.
<br>
<p>Mr. Kaczynski thought of himself as a revolutionary; but David Gelernter is 
<br>
the real thing. Though he rarely gives speeches, Professor Gelernter 
<br>
captivated the crowd with an hourlong performance that was deliberately 
<br>
provocative and salted with laugh lines. 
<br>
<p>The time has come, he said, to fix a problem that has not been addressed in 
<br>
some 15 years: Computers are lousy at organizing our information; the 
<br>
antiquated system of sorting documents into folders and trying to maintain 
<br>
order has fallen apart. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Working together, named files and hierarchical folders have turned modern 
<br>
desktop computers into electronic versions of a 1940 Steelcase file cabinet,&quot; 
<br>
he said. &quot;We do the filing; we do the organizing; we do the retrieving. Why 
<br>
do we put up with it? How many of us wanted to grow up to be file clerks?&quot;
<br>
<p>Fixing the file folder system might seem like an awfully small target for one 
<br>
of the most respected figures in computer science. But the issue and the 
<br>
design decisions that led to this current state of affairs are as fundamental 
<br>
to computing as they are intractable. 
<br>
<p>And now Mr. Gelernter wants to sell us all a solution: Scopeware, a set of 
<br>
computing tools for helping information organize itself in ways that users 
<br>
can readily understand. The system, which made its debut in March, takes all 
<br>
the documents of a business (or, in a version still to come, of a single 
<br>
user) and works quietly alongside current software to organize every new 
<br>
document into a &quot;stream&quot; in the order the documents are created. 
<br>
<p>Onscreen, the stream looks like a long row of icons receding into the past: 
<br>
word processing, e-mail, presentations, spreadsheets and more, identified by 
<br>
little symbols and a few words. Move the cursor over any document and a 
<br>
representation of it shows up in the lower right corner of the screen; a 
<br>
mouse click brings the full document up in its original form. The stream can 
<br>
be dipped into, and the documents sorted in a number of ways through powerful 
<br>
search tools.
<br>
<p>The Mirror Worlds team has designed the system to accommodate business 
<br>
computer networks, mobile laptops and hand-held devices, diverting the stream 
<br>
wherever it is needed. The effect of having everything in one place, 
<br>
Professor Gelernter says, is a new ease in finding individual documents that 
<br>
are now scattered among many applications. More important, he says, the 
<br>
stream forms a kind of narrative: it tells a story.
<br>
<p>&quot;We sometimes forget that the basics of information management don't change,&quot; 
<br>
he said. &quot;We think and talk and listen; we read and write and look at 
<br>
pictures. That was the essence of information management in the 13th century, 
<br>
and it still is today. Computers can put us in touch with the world and, more 
<br>
important, with ourselves.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Professor Gelernter says he is not selling his wares so much as a new vision 
<br>
of the future. &quot;It would be crazy to predict that Scopeware will emerge as 
<br>
the winner in the changing world of information management,&quot; he told the 
<br>
audience. &quot;But I will predict this: Scopeware's properties are the properties 
<br>
that a winning system will need, and the direction Scopeware points is the 
<br>
right direction.&quot; 
<br>
<p>In fact, little of Professor Gelernter's critique is new. And many companies 
<br>
have worked to solve the problem. Many companies are scrambling to offer 
<br>
products in the technology niche known as knowledge management. But something 
<br>
about Scopeware grabs people. 
<br>
<p>The author and technology commentator George Gilder grew even more hyperbolic 
<br>
than usual after getting a look. &quot;To try the Gelernter system is to fall in 
<br>
love with it,&quot; he wrote in the May issue of the Gilder Technology Report 
<br>
newsletter. &quot;It is elegant, easy, natural and beautiful. It will prevail.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Is it crazy to try to start a revolution in computing at a time when everyone 
<br>
else appears to be hunkering down, and when Microsoft, coming off last week's 
<br>
appeals court ruling, seems as dominant as ever?
<br>
<p>There was precious little in the glittering booths at PC Expo that claimed to 
<br>
break with the past; most of the products on display were designed to do what 
<br>
people already do, but a little more efficiently or powerfully. But, as 
<br>
Michael Satow, the chief executive of Mirror Worlds, says, &quot;That's the best 
<br>
time to go on the offensive — when everyone else is on the defensive.&quot; 
<br>
<p>For his part, Professor Gelernter has come a long way since that terrible day 
<br>
in 1993 when he opened a mysterious package delivered to his Yale office. The 
<br>
explosion left him scarred, partly blinded and deaf in one ear. In an e-mail 
<br>
response to a few personal questions, he wrote: &quot;I can do what I need to do 
<br>
(be with my family, help educate my boys, paint, write, make a living). My 
<br>
hand hurts continuously but not acutely. Mainly this sort of thing just runs 
<br>
your energy down &amp; down &amp; down. By early evening I'm more or less dead on my 
<br>
feet.&quot; 
<br>
<p>He doesn't let the past burden him; Mr. Kaczynski is &quot;still a topic of no 
<br>
interest to me,&quot; he wrote.
<br>
<p>&quot;Victimhood is a state you accept or reject, and I'm still the farthest thing 
<br>
on earth from a victim.&quot; 
<br>
<p>If anything, he continued, the attack has left him with a renewed sense of 
<br>
purpose — an urge to wrestle everything there is out of every day, whether 
<br>
the time is spent with a canvas, with family or on Scopeware. 
<br>
<p>But he said he also knew that he was not the only driven person in the 
<br>
technology business. &quot;There are lots of devoted fanatics out there, and it 
<br>
doesn't take getting blown up by a bomb to make you believe intensely that 
<br>
what you have is important, is coming, is exactly right.&quot; 
<br>
<p>He craves success for Scopeware, and &quot;the inevitable clarifying intensity 
<br>
that follows coming to work one morning &amp; almost dying DOES have something to 
<br>
do with it.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Despite everything, Professor Gelernter wrote, he is one of the fortunate 
<br>
ones. &quot;I can't claim that everything's turned out exactly as I'd hoped; far 
<br>
from it.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Still, &quot;as Fred Astaire tells Joan Leslie in `The Sky's the Limit,' `I 
<br>
couldn't be luckier than I am tonight.' &quot;
