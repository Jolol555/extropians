<p>Thanks! I came out of the closet on this relatively recently.

</em><br>
<p>Maybe that is another goal to strive for besides life extension: asymptotic
<br>
adolescence. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A certain critic of posthuman ideas told me he fears life extension because

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, the old are becoming more powerful even without radical life
<br>
extension (50% of the japanese population will be 60 or above in 2100), so
<br>
we would have to deal with that in any case.
<br>
<p>Often I think this fear is due to the stereotype that old people are set in
<br>
their ways, and that makes them natural conservatives. There might also be
<br>
an element in that old people tend to have acquired funds throughout life
<br>
and hence are richer, which in public choice-ish self interest would
<br>
suggest there is at least a bias in certain political questions.  But I'm
<br>
not certain how strong these effects really are or if they are truly bad.
<br>
And even if they are, it would IMHO still be ethical to go for life
<br>
extension.
