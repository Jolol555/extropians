<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The thing that worries me is that if government is reduced to the point

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that many libertarians want, then they risk simply becoming lackeys of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; describe above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Who is 'they'? If you mean the government, powerful business interests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are not able to use the government to any extent because that government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is limited in what it can do. In such a situation, a union, for example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would always overpower a corporation because the union membership will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; always outnumber the corporation's lackeys, where both sides can arm or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; disarm as much as they wish. The government would not be empowered to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; step in on the corporations side to force the union to settle, or impede
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the union membership from arming as they see fit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Liberals always see themselves, as individuals, as being entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; powerless in all possible situations, reliant on the government patron
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to protect them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regarding liberals seeing themselves as &quot;powerless&quot; in all possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations:  Do you mean some liberals?  All liberals?  12.895% of liberals?
</em><br>
<p>Generally most liberals, if not all, with the possible exception of
<br>
those who are simply rich bigots burdened by guilt. Victimology is an
<br>
inherent trait of left-liberals and their memetic constructs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  This is part of the liberal victimological myth that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has evolved from common serf attitudes held by immigrants coming from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; feudal and tyrannical systems. They don't see that if the power of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government is reduced, not only is the ability of the corporations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reduced (since their power is given to them by government protections),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but the individuals regain great power as individuals, because that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where the government got its power in the first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, but ... leaving things just to &quot;individuals&quot; didn't work out too well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the past, did it?  What's wrong with a checks-and-balances system?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Accountability ... coalitions ... these are not irresponsible ideas, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they can certainly be part of a governing system.  People (individuals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after all) make up government -  it's not like it's some kind of amorphous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity of The Bad Crimson Guy with Horns.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the times that it was left to individuals in reality, things
<br>
worked rather well. Take medieval Iceland, for instance, which is
<br>
probably the first and most accurately functioning libertarian society
<br>
in history.
<br>
<p>Iceland had some interesting characteristics. It was remote and hard to
<br>
get to, so while immigration was not illegal, there was a significant
<br>
barrier to entry in the financial and individual ability sense. Those
<br>
that reached the island were generally very capable individuals who were
<br>
highly self reliant and who respected and cooperated with others with
<br>
similar characteristics.
<br>
<p>There was no government, but there were individuals who acted as
<br>
'umpires' in resolving disputes. There was private property, but also a
<br>
right of transit, and there was no perception of conflict between the
<br>
two, although the primary means of transportation was by sea, which was
<br>
seen as 'ownerless', or rather, the domain of deities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Under libertarianism, laborers will gain far greater power than they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; realize, and corporations will finally be fully exposed to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; retribution they earn by unjust actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sigh.  Got any historical precedents?  (when laborers had the &quot;power,&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations were very, very goooooooooood boys).
</em><br>
<p>The reason that the early labor movement had trouble is that they always
<br>
had strength in numbers and won initial engagements against employers on
<br>
a tactical basis, even when the employers hired Pinkertons and other
<br>
mercenaries. Their methods were often crude (along Luddite lines) where
<br>
they destroyed the assets of the employer. It was only when the
<br>
employers appealed to the government for assistance and protection that
<br>
labor lost their edge and were persecuted with the help of unjust legal
<br>
precedents. The reason the early labor unions lost for so long after
<br>
early tactica victories is that they were simply a rabble in arms, with
<br>
no guiding intelligence, their leadership was as ignorant as the rank
<br>
and file.
