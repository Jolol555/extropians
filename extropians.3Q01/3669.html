</em><br>
<p>I think here we have the basic root of the disagreement.  Contact lenses
<br>
are part of a continuing trend toward *physical* transhumanity that
<br>
started with wooden legs; contact lenses are on the path to Primo 3M, and
<br>
adaptive-optics LASIK even more obviously so.  Humanity's past experience
<br>
with physical enhancement has shown that, despite the inevitable cries of
<br>
&lt;whatever&gt;, physical enhancement is a good thing that makes everyone's
<br>
lives easier; even if the technology is expensive at first, it soon
<br>
becomes cheaper.  Repeated disproof of the naysayers has demonstrated that
<br>
physical enhancement has basically no drawbacks, only benefits.  It is
<br>
both legitimate and valid to take a physical transhumanity scenario like
<br>
3M and draw a line from that to contact lenses; the metaphor reflects a
<br>
similarity of underlying causes.  In speaking to an audience, one would
<br>
expect them to sense the validity of this metaphor and to be justly
<br>
reassured.
<br>
<p>But to me, &quot;transhuman&quot; has almost purely the connotation of a transhuman
<br>
mind.  An ape may be able to lift heavier weights than I do, but he is not
<br>
a transhuman.  A human is a human mind; the brain is what sets the human
<br>
species aside and defines our ecological niche, not sharp eyes or rending
<br>
talons or poisonous fangs.  A being with a tail and four arms and a human
<br>
psychology is a human in a funny suit.  So if we're talking about
<br>
cognitive transhumanity, which is the territory that humanity will be
<br>
entering shortly, then it is utterly unlike anything in humanity's social
<br>
or technological experience.  I would expect even the most unprepared,
<br>
nontechnical audience to be disturbed on some level by any analogy between
<br>
&quot;transhumanity&quot; and contact lenses, sensing intuitively that it really
<br>
isn't the same thing at all, even if they would find it difficult to put
<br>
the problem into words.
