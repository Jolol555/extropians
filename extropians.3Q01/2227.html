<p>Yep, that is the general idea. It gets away from that dumb mistake people 
<br>
tend to make over and over again:
<br>
<p>Europe is the single center of the world... oops, the Earth is round.
<br>
The Earth is the single center of the solar system... oops, the sun is.
<br>
Our solar system is the single center of the universe... oops, we are on 
<br>
the edge of our Milky Way galaxy.
<br>
Our galaxy is the single center of the universe... oops, those other things 
<br>
way out there -- they are other galaxies.
<br>
The universe had a single central starting point 15 billion years ago... oops
<br>
<p>If you hear people talk about the big-bang theory you could be forgiven for 
<br>
thinking that it is proven fact and not simply a theory. Even the microwave 
<br>
background radiation which is hailed as a great vidicator for big-bang was 
<br>
a real problem for it in the early days. But theories get modified to fit.
<br>
<p>I kinda like the idea of old material getting squashed out of existence in 
<br>
black holes and new material popping into existence in the great voids. Now 
<br>
that we know about vacuum energy (can't remember the proper term) it 
<br>
doesn't seem infeasible.
<br>
<p>I have never understood the problem most people have with infinity. It 
<br>
seems way more natural than a beginning or an end. As one who has 
<br>
subscribed to an extropian way of thinking since early childhood the 
<br>
prospect of a universe which never dies is infinitely more appealing.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
