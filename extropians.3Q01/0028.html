<p>Hmmm, Spike, this needs to be written up in more detail.
<br>
The problem of the quantity of heat required to melt the ice,
<br>
the rate of heat transfer into the ice and the rate at which
<br>
the oceans would rise is an important problem.  One which
<br>
is likely to be short-shrifted given the popularity one
<br>
can expect for A.I.
<br>
<p>Why should you write it up?  Because this wasn't obvious to me!
<br>
Now, mind you I hadn't thought about it in detail, but I'd
<br>
generally assert that if its not obvious to me it certainly isn't
<br>
going to be obvious to many people.
<br>
<p>So if you can find a discussion of this on the net, send me the
<br>
pointers.  If not, you have to write it up.  No arguments, groans,
<br>
claiming a lazy butt, etc.  You have to write up a clear position
<br>
paper determining the time it would take to melt the glaciers on
<br>
the planet.  I'll make a specific place on the net for you to
<br>
put it.
<br>
<p>As an EXTROPIAN, it is your responsibility to see that bad memes
<br>
not spread excessivly.  Therefore, it is your duty to see this
<br>
idea through to completion!  (I just love saying that...)
<br>
<p>Now, after it is written up, perhaps we can send something off
<br>
to Spielberg and his writers asking for a response as to why
<br>
they painted a picture of an &quot;impossible&quot; scenario.   A
<br>
confrontation such as that, would I think, provide extropians
<br>
with some spending currency in the Pro-Act arena.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, if we thought it over, there are ways of storing water
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inland on Antarctica, even in a runaway greenhouse scenario.  Also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we could cool the earth if necessary by artificially increasing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet's albedo, again with plenty of time to react.
</em><br>
<p>These ideas too should be added to the paper.  Its time to bury
<br>
the Doom-N-Gloomists with the facts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the greenhouse transition is over thousands of years, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all seems irrelevant, for our terraforming technology will long be in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place before we lowlanders start needing to swim.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with that point.  That much is obvious to me from having
<br>
researched the carbon fixing capacity of the oceans.  *However*(!),
<br>
that isn't to say that there will not be thousands to millions of
<br>
lives lost due to climate disruptions.  This week's Science paints
<br>
a very grim picture of the consequences to the Texas Medical Center
<br>
(www.tmc.edu) from the recent rains in Houston.  The losses in
<br>
animals involved in ongoing biomedical studies will have unforeseen
<br>
negative consequences in future years that impact on human health
<br>
and well-being.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Movie scenes of a drowning statue of liberty are memorable but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place incorrect and harmful memes in the minds of the masses. spike
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It depends how far you take them.  To raise concerns of sustainability
<br>
is IMO a good thing.  To preach doom-n-gloom is most probably a bad
<br>
thing.  The trick is to strike a balance between motivation and panic.
<br>
