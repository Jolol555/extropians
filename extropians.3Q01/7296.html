<p>Yes, of course.  However, what I'm suggesting is that your subjective
<br>
state[*] when reacting to a significant event will be identical across a
<br>
larger percentage of worlds than it would when reacting to a less
<br>
significant event.  A less significant event, in which your reaction is less
<br>
*obvious*, might be more open to perturbation from outside (that is, outside
<br>
of those things that make up your subjective state) influences - i.e., some
<br>
external force might cause you to react differently to the event.  Since the
<br>
percentage of worlds in which your subjective state is identical is higher,
<br>
you are &quot;spread&quot; further across the multiverse and you should therefore
<br>
expect a greater probability of finding an anomalous reading from a random
<br>
source because you have a greater number of potential samples.
<br>
<p>[* Basically, just all those things that define your subjective
<br>
point-of-view.  I assume it to be discrete.]
