<p><em>&gt; You're argument has generally been that all religions

</em><br>
<p>The default general sentiment on this list---and
<br>
you should know being a long time lurker---is the
<br>
libertarian one of &quot;Abhor the initial use of force,
<br>
except to defend private property&quot;, or words to that
<br>
effect.

<p><em>&gt; Revealing that mystical experiences occur because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this or that section of the brain temporarily does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this or that unusual thing DOES arguably &quot;debunk&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CERTAIN aspects of CERTAIN &quot;religious&quot; beliefs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it just as arguably ALSO does REINFORCE OTHER
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspects of OTHER &quot;religious&quot; beliefs.
</em><br>
<p>I would like to know what OTHER &quot;religious&quot;
<br>
beliefs.  Thanks.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; What is important to realize is that the brain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a very real sense, defines our experience of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality. All of our experience with &quot;reality&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is mediated by the systems of the brain.
</em><br>
<p>This is materialist dogma! :-)  hardly a needed
<br>
claim when talking to the un-Godly
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Obviously, SOME [brain] states can be argued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;a less accurate representation&quot; than others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (death; sleep, etc.);
</em><br>
<p>don't forget to mention false beliefs, since
<br>
we're on the subject of religion!  But also
<br>
any mistaken &quot;knowledge&quot; of any kind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but the kinds of altered states that are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focus of WGWGA involve heightened awareness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surroundings, improved abilities, greater senses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of well-being, and other things that extropians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should find desirable.
</em><br>
<p>For sure.  So the idea is that our brain has
<br>
been wired up so that religious people tend
<br>
to have these desirable features?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fact that, in these same experiences, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of &quot;Self&quot; is radically altered does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously relegate such brain states to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the category of undesirable dementia.
</em><br>
<p>Even megalomania under some situations would 
<br>
be very desirable; yes, our present wiring
<br>
*could* cause many kinds of irrational beliefs
<br>
to have some advantage or other.  But, short of
<br>
me reading the book, what are some of the 
<br>
alterations of &quot;Self&quot; that would appeal to
<br>
an extropian?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are our hearts part of our selves, when they can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replaced with artificial pumps? Our lungs, are they...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can't live without our local star, the sun,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (yet); is it part of our &quot;self&quot;?  Just where does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our &quot;self&quot; end and the rest of the universe begin?
</em><br>
<p>In terms of information flow, I'm confident that the
<br>
self in most individuals has an actual existence.  It's
<br>
clear that in terms of bandwidth, the self is contained
<br>
in the brain.  From there, I'd agree, it can get pretty
<br>
murky.  But I want to fight for the integrity of my self,
<br>
as people instinctively do, and as extropians and many
<br>
others very consciously and deliberately do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The &quot;usual&quot; sense of self no doubt won out in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Darwinian sense because it drives us to actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which ultimately result in more offspring, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then, obviously, so does the &quot;usual&quot; state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our sex drives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, on this list, not less than Mr. Max
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More himself has expressed the desire to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to temporarily turn off his sex drive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a desire I fully understand. It would be nice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be free of the whole darn tormenting thing.
</em><br>
<p>This is a choice that hopefully we'll have 
<br>
soon---but each to his own.  In a recent
<br>
discussion on this list, it was found that
<br>
quite a few of us don't have any desire to
<br>
turn it off.
<br>
<p>Now your suggestion---charitably put---that
<br>
some might want to turn off their self, well,
<br>
that's somewhat akin to suicide in my book.
<br>
But then---each to his own.  Who knows, life
<br>
as a vegetable, despite its lack of glamour
<br>
or fashionableness, might be what some would
<br>
like (sorry, I don't mean to imply that you
<br>
would, but it is a logical extension).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I find the notion of &quot;taking drastic measures&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to drive out from society memes as fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as any related to &quot;religiosity&quot; a starkly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frightening one, bringing to mind book burning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and concentration camps. The last time I mentioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this on the list, I was shouted down.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you meant on this list to imply that
<br>
a lot of us do not respect others freedom to
<br>
believe what they wanted, then you perhaps
<br>
deserve to be &quot;shouted down&quot;.  (I've always
<br>
found that a strange metaphor on an email
<br>
discussion list!)   PLEASE!  Every time that
<br>
you make such an accusation involving the
<br>
use of force or &quot;drastic measure&quot;, PLEASE
<br>
quote the offending party.  I have this ugly
<br>
feeling that you cannot substantiate your
<br>
claims here, and are just attacking straw men,
<br>
a practice that I have found rare to
<br>
non-existent on extropians!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have concluded that this list will always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a haven for the rabidly anti-religious,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and have accepted this flaw, and hardly ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post, but just lurk.
</em><br>
<p>Well, there may be something to your claim here.
<br>
But next time that someone gets pretty rabid, 
<br>
know that they're probably having negative impact.
<br>
You can &quot;get even&quot; very powerfully by just quoting
<br>
the offending passages back, and being very calm
<br>
and reasonable in your response: you'll gain 
<br>
ground, and they'll lose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is funny (to me) that this argument about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion recurs on a yearly basis on this list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Methinks he doth protest too much.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Well, I really doubt it.  I've heard many people
<br>
really rant and rave about say, racism, or sexism,
<br>
but it never crossed my mind that they could be
<br>
&quot;protesting too much&quot;.  I think you're grasping
<br>
at straws.
