</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; is very unlikely that we'll be able to persuade politicians to give clipper
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; controller is nobody&quot; -- but you know that is not going to happen.
</em><br>
<p>You are falling into a deterministic trap here: since the idea is making
<br>
rounds again you believe it will become a bill, that bill is going to
<br>
get passed and implemented. But remember that the clipper chip was
<br>
*crushed*. The fact that this idea was defeated once means that it is
<br>
actually going to have a harder time today than it would if it was an
<br>
entirely new concept with a clear background. Sure, it will get a lot of
<br>
help from the current mood, but it is not an irresistible power.
<br>
<p>Although my ambitious side does like the idea of me and Max being part
<br>
of the controlling group - in this case I guess that would be NIST, NSA
<br>
or some high level court - &quot;infiltrating&quot; them is of course a total pipe
<br>
dream. You won't get a chance to control a technology if you lie about
<br>
your intentions to the surrounding administration. Remember, in our kind
<br>
of society you actually have to give reasons for your actions when you
<br>
do them as part of an administration. 
<br>
<p>A far more realistic approach to stop this technology is to raise hell
<br>
about it - explain to proponents why it won't work and why it will have
<br>
nasty side effects, get the non-initiated to understand what is wrong
<br>
with it and why it should not be supported.  Convince other nations to
<br>
not accept the standard. Develop other technologies that makes even the
<br>
introduction of the technology irrelevant. If it is passed, then work
<br>
against the laws, even to the point of civil disobedience. 
<br>
<p>Notice that this is messy, real world things that have to be done. There
<br>
is no way of achiving it by wishing for the technology to be in wise
<br>
hands (and mine definitely aren't; I think I could make a fairly nasty
<br>
dictator a la Trevor Goodchild if I got the chance - don't let me!).
