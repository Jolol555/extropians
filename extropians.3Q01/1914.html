<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; (I'm exaggerating, of course, but there is some truth to that...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Hardly, considering that the US has the highest percentage of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;population with business ownership / self employed of any industrialized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;nation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That may be.  Still.....my point is that if you have wealth then that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is dependent mainly (in most cases) upon the demand for that wealth by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other people.  I think I have shown that this system (call it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism or whatever else you want) NECESSITATES that some sizeable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fraction of the population MUST GO WITHOUT the basics of a comfortable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life; furthermore, there must also exist some still fraction that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; struggles to keep falling into that bottom category.
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me? How is it that one person's wealth requires that other people
<br>
be poor? If you are going to make an asinine argument about relative
<br>
levels of wealth, then I can categorically say that relational
<br>
comparisons are useless.
<br>
<p>In a country where the average welfare recipient has a cell phone, a
<br>
VCR, a TV, and a diet of over 2500 calories a day, I fail to see where
<br>
'must go without' even fits into the equation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a myriad of laws/regulations/cultural norms designed to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it harder to obtain the basics of a comfortable life.  These laws/regs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc prop up wealth.  This is oppression and exploitation, nothing less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (of course, everytime I mention exploitation, the kneejerk response is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot; oh well how is offering a low paying job exploitation?&quot; That has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing to do with it, of course..)
</em><br>
<p>While the old welfare system did prohibit recipients from obtaining
<br>
assets that could be used to make them independent of the welfare
<br>
system, this is no longer the case. I also fail to see how a system that
<br>
forcibly confiscates 39% of the income of the wealthiest people 'props
<br>
up wealth'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just because it is 10 or 20 or whatever percent of the population that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is oppressed, means nothing.  They have no more, so they riot.
</em><br>
<p>THis is so bogus. Over 70% of the population owns stock in corporations,
<br>
and over 60% of the black population does.
