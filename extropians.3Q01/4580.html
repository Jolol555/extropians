</em><br>
<p>britannica.com says:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Enlightenment developed in Europe during the 18th century,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moral abhorrence of slavery began to spread. Societies were formed in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain and the United States to end the slave trade. The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[23]Anti-Slavery Society, established in Britain in 1823, succeeded in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freeing slaves in the British colonies in the Western Hemisphere by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1833. France abolished slavery in the West Indies in 1848, and slavery
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was permanently ended in the United States in 1865 with the passage of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.
<br>
<p>And slavery didn't exist in the western European countries themselves to be
<br>
abolished, as far as _I_ recall.  Slavery was in fact the peculiar institution
<br>
of the United States, at least among Enlightenment societies; Christianity had
<br>
put a severe dent in slavery in Europe a long time before, with serfdom
<br>
filling some of the void.
<br>
<p>More:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Russian Empire grew and its hegemony spread, it adopted the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tendency of 19th-century imperialist powers to enforce abolition when
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;embarking upon colonization. Thus the conquest of the Caucasus led to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the abolition of slavery by the 1860s and the conquest in Central Asia
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Islamic khanates of Bukhara, Samarkand, and Khiva by the 1870s.
<br>
...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chile freed its black slaves in 1823; Mexico abolished slavery in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1829, and Peru in 1854.
<br>
<p>Oh, but those aren't major nations, of course.
