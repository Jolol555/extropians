</em><br>
<p>Bear in mind that Barbara wrote as one in *favor* of the general proposal.
<br>
She clearly doesn't regard this essay as a knockdown argument.
<br>
<p>The cited essay makes some interesting points about the Moynihan/Nixon
<br>
Portland experiment, which I've been trying to chase down on the web. More
<br>
later. There are a number of thick pdf files to read... The general
<br>
argument strikes me as empty, since in the first instance GMI is meant to
<br>
replace existing social security benefits and all their red tape and
<br>
pettyfogging, and it's hard to see why that would be worse for the soul. Is
<br>
anyone here genuinely arguing that dealing with bureaucrats on a weekly
<br>
basis is a *better* plan, an improving experience that should be
<br>
*encouraged*? Dog give me strength.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Brian Williams also writes
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; What happens to so-called minimum wage jobs?  Don't get me wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the jobs will still be there but they will go vacant, why work for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; minimum wage when you can make the same doing nothing?
</em><br>
<p>Are people at large so entirely swinish, so lacking in self-respect, that
<br>
they will *refuse* to take a job if it's offered? (Okay, many are, and it
<br>
might be argued that many more will become so.) The long-term point of the
<br>
GMI proposal, however, is that sooner or later plenty of (endurable) jobs
<br>
*just won't exist*. Some beast might well young women to crouch naked in
<br>
the living room as tables--recall the imagery of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, except
<br>
that those female torsos were plastic--but how valuable will that be?
<br>
Mowing lawns and toting the garbage will eventually go the way of pickin'
<br>
cotton. 
<br>
<p>But the key rebuttal is surely that people in a rational GMI regime
<br>
*wouldn't* have an either/or choice. One will get the GMI payment, enough
<br>
to scrape by on, and in order to improve one's lot will need to get a
<br>
menial or a CEO job, or hold up gas stations (just like now), or do open
<br>
source, or paint big-eyed babies on black velvet for tourist coins, and
<br>
only lose the GMI entitlement amount paid back in tax after a sensible
<br>
threshold has been passed.
