</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; So is it nature or nurture?  That is the question.  Seems to me the obvious 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Of course.  This has actually been known for a whole century (at least).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My intellectual curiosity does seem to be a product of my biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make-up, particularly since I seem to excel in that more so even than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my own parents.  But I wonder at what age it would finally have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed if it hadn't been nurtured by my parents.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, that has to remain an imponderable until we are able to
<br>
either run simulations or clones get cheap.

<em>&gt; 70% nature and 30% nurture; that is the answer.
</em><br>
Well, that's about what they've found for *intelligence*, but hardly
<br>
for a lot of other predispostions.

<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are there sound, scientific, a priori reasons for saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there are no race differences in intelligence due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature-genetics?  What are they?
</em><br>
<p>The only alleged &quot;scientific&quot; reasons (pushed off on everyone
<br>
in the 1960's) that there are *no* race differences in intelligence
<br>
or anything else, should be rejected by those with open minds and
<br>
who are current with modern investigations.
<br>
<p>As I said in a previous post, however, it is an even worse 
<br>
mistake to think that such differences are anything more than
<br>
statistical; there has been too little time for large differences
<br>
to evolve, and at present there is, of course, a very large overlap
<br>
between all human groups.
