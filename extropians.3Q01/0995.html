<em>&gt; I'd suggest the anniversary of the day that Galileo first turned his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; telescope to the heavens in 1610.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russell
</em><br>
<p>Couldn't find exact date he first used telescope.
<br>
<p>How about the day he published: March 12.

Galileo gradually improved the power of his telescope, grinding lenses
<br>
himself, and began observing the heavens. In the first two months of 1610, he
<br>
was writing The Starry Messenger, and by 12 March, the book was already
<br>
printed at Venice, dedicated to Cosimo de' Medici. Galileo continued his
<br>
<p>The Telescope
<br>

<br>
Verifying Galileo's discoveries was initially difficult. In the spring of 1610
<br>
no one had telescopes of sufficient quality and power to see the satellites of
<br>
Jupiter, although many had weaker instruments with which they could see some
<br>
of the lunar detail Galileo had described in Sidereus Nuncius. Galileo's lead
<br>
was one of practice, not theory, and it took about six months before others
<br>
could make or obtain instruments good enough to see Jupiter's moons. With the
<br>
verification of the phases of Venus by others, in the first half of 1611,
<br>
Galileo's lead in telescope-making had more or less evaporated. The next
<br>
discovery, that of sunspots, was made by several observers, including Galileo,
<br>
independently.

<p>Stay hungry,

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
