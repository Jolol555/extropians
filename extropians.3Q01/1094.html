</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isn't this a bit of a cliche? It's one regularly trotted out by religious

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>My, my.  You talk of &quot;scientism&quot; being cliche and then put two
<br>
cliches and a huge generalization into your next sentence.  &lt;g&gt;
<br>
<p>I don't apologize for religion/spirituality and I am not in the
<br>
least sentimental about it.  I also don't dismiss it and
<br>
especially not as lightly as seems fashionable around these
<br>
parts of late.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And, in case you're tempted to retort that cliches usually contain a grain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of truth (which I accept), most of us who admire the advancement of science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do *not* treat it as a religion. We favour rational inquiry into nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through methods such as observation, experiment, mathematical modelling,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formal logic, hypothetico-deductive reasoning. The conclusions we come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are provisional. Where the more precise methods of science break down, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still favour rational techniques such as logic and consilience, the methods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>This is not what is meant by the term &quot;scientism&quot;.  The above is
<br>
mostly simply science.  I don't think &quot;consilience&quot; is
<br>
sufficient or well enough known to cover the rest.  Nor is
<br>
philsophy restricted to logic and consilience alone.  Where
<br>
&quot;scientism&quot; starts is in the assumption that that which is not
<br>
ameanable to scientific method and the rest you have listed
<br>
above is per force invalid or at least very likely so.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This was not the approach adopted by religious thinkers in founding their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encyclopedic explanatory systems. Nor is it generally the approach of modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious believers in coming to believe - usually through some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mystical experience or else by childhood indoctrination.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And you cannot by use of science, logic or consilience simply
<br>
dismiss other means of knowledge as invalid.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The difficulty for religions is that the methods of rational investigation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have gradually explained aspects of nature in ways that are still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provisional but have pretty much eliminated many of the answers previously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given by religions.
</em><br>
<p>The purpose of religion is not to explain aspects of nature and
<br>
that never was its primary purpose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there is something that can legitimately be called &quot;scientism&quot;, I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think you'll find many believers in it on this list. Attacking such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed &quot;religion&quot; is a pretty obvious straw man argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>With the current facile dismissal of &quot;religiosity&quot; and
<br>
spirituality in general I find that scientism is quite well
<br>
represented here.
