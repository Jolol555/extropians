<p>Miriam, have you not been paying attention to what they are saying? They
<br>
think we are the great evil! They hate western culture because it is based
<br>
on the principles of self-esteem, reason, and Capitalism, and not sacrifice,
<br>
religion, and collectivism. How dare we tip our champagne glasses when
<br>
people are starving. How dare we indulge in air-conditioning when there are
<br>
so many without it. How dare we be a rich, pleasurable, rational society
<br>
when there are so many that aren't! This is a war of ideas. We are fighting
<br>
an philosophy here. Bin laten is one little manifestation of that system.
<br>
Kill him and 500 more will be cranked out. Its the system that needs to be
<br>
removed and ASAP. You didn't see those dancing in the streets? They are just
<br>
as guilty as Bin Laden because they support the governments that support the
<br>
terrorist. I cant imagine that this list would be in such disagreement on
<br>
theses issues. Those countries are the most luddite, anti-technology,
<br>
anti-capitalist, anti-reason countries you could find. You go right ahead
<br>
and think about particular concretes and don't try to link these concretes
<br>
and understand the relationship. What is the commonality in all these
<br>
countries other then their intense hatred of America for its greatness? Why
<br>
do they hate us? Well maybe if we don't look for a reason and address it,
<br>
the problem will go away.
<br>
<p>It also amazes me that on a list where towers/elevators to space would be
<br>
discussed, there would be the suggestion not building them because they
<br>
might be torn down or might be dangerous.
<br>
<p>Try to break free of the concretes of the issue and deal with the overlaying
<br>
abstractions. Bin Laden needs to be dealt with, but what created him? What
<br>
mindset and philosophical viewpoint is he coming from. Ill tell you its one
<br>
that very popular here in our country and that you will find his ideas
<br>
reflected in numerous circles here ranging from the environmental/anti-man
<br>
movement, to the religions here. They all agree that the individual needs to
<br>
be placed on the alter of self-sacrifice to the masses. Both the extreme
<br>
left in this country and the extreme right believe exactly as Bin Laden,
<br>
that the individual is nothing compared to the
<br>
environment/religion/masses/cultural group. History is the battle of ideas,
<br>
and if you don't support your own system with the full belief that you are
<br>
correct, they you are going consigned to the quagmire of guilt that so many
<br>
around now seemed to be steeped in. The big enemies we should be fighting on
<br>
our front (as well as those foreign) are guilt and fear. Most of the guilt
<br>
is because we still have in this age of moon walks and supercomputers, that
<br>
we still possess the philosophy of cave men. Those that carry that
<br>
philosophy, and its a majority of people for the most part, deserve it and
<br>
the guilt.
