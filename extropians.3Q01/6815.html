<p><p>In reply to article by Tamim Ansary, starting with the following paragraph:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've been hearing a lot of talk about &quot;bombing Afghanistan back to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stone Age.&quot; Ronn Owens, on KGO Talk Radio today, allowed that this would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean killing innocent people, people who had nothing to do with this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atrocity, but &quot;we're at war, we have to accept collateral damage. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else can we do?&quot; Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether we &quot;have the belly to do what must be done.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><p>My reaction:
<br>
Then we will prevail.  Let me explain.
<br>
<p>The basic premise is that the US or the world will respond by levelling 
<br>
Afganistan.  That doesn't make sense, and history doesn't bear this out.
<br>
<p>The US government is well-aware of that situation.  So far the US is 
<br>
starting out with getting cooperation from countries like Pakistan, and 
<br>
even Iran closed its border.
<br>
<p>There is really no reason to believe that the US will be going after 
<br>
civilians who aren't part of the Taliban operation.  As you mention, it 
<br>
would be bad strategy.  It's also bad military tactics.
<br>
<p>OBL (and the rest of the cockroaches) made the mistake of believing that 
<br>
the US or the rest of the world will retaliate on his terms.  We don't 
<br>
have to, and once one turns away from the rhetoric we are essentially 
<br>
unable to retaliate on his terms.
<br>
<p>Look at America's reactions during the cold war.  Hollywood will do, to a 
<br>
limited extent.  If we wanted to depict evil, we depicted Nazis.  If we 
<br>
wanted to depict ruthless militarism, we still depicted WWII.  I can't 
<br>
think of a single depiction of the Russian people as a military or moral 
<br>
target.  In other words, there was never any popular inclination to 
<br>
&quot;destroy&quot; the Soviet peoples.
<br>
<p>What did our government do during those times?  Mutual Assured 
<br>
Destruction (MAD).  Our military convinced their military to modify each 
<br>
of our the philosophies of &quot;protect the homeland&quot;.
<br>
<p>Iraq was fought as a conventional war.  There was major bombing, but this 
<br>
was targeted at direct military targets, infrastructure, and specific 
<br>
industries.  Like facilities whos purpose was to &quot;advance medical 
<br>
research&quot;.  The western powers were there at the invitation of Saudi 
<br>
Arabia and a number of other countries in that region.
<br>
<p>Did the US have the belly to do what was needed?  Overrunning Iraq would 
<br>
have been easy.  We even had a temporary government in the form of the 
<br>
Gulf states.  Instead of overrunning Iraq, the US let Saadam have the 
<br>
country and more pointedly let Iraq have Saadam.  So instead of 
<br>
rebuilding now that the war is over, Iraq gets essentially what they 
<br>
either wanted or more likely weren't willing to get rid of.  The US was 
<br>
willing to risk Iraq retaining a few nukes and come strains of anthrax 
<br>
and smallpox.  Is that resolve or what?  I say the US, but the world and 
<br>
regional powers had to go along with that one.
<br>
<p>There was even a bit of tit-for-tat (getting-even) during the Cold War.  
<br>
But do OBL and the others really think that the US or the rest of the 
<br>
world will respond in that manner?  Maybe we'll just go around trying to 
<br>
get rid of those cockroaches.
<br>
<p>OBL isn't the first to make this mistake.  Adm. Yamamoto knew that his 
<br>
attack on Pearl Harbour would be the end of the Japanese Empire, but the 
<br>
government believed their stereotype image of America.  The Japanese 
<br>
analysts figured that if they could destroy the entire US military, it 
<br>
would take about 2 years for the US to rebuild to a strength which 
<br>
exceeded that if Japanese Empire.  The idea was that the US would just 
<br>
run scared.  Sure, go ahead and have your stereotype about the enemy, but 
<br>
if you act on them, you had better be right.
<br>
<p>It wasn't even an original idea.  Charles Mansion was a mass murderer
<br>
who assembled a &quot;commune&quot; of people to kill people in Beverly Hills.
<br>
His idea was that he could start a race war of some sort.  Nobody was
<br>
interested.  Will someone please, please tell these people to give it up.
<br>
<p>In the end, if we are able to do something about Afganistan, then the 
<br>
Afgani people will come out ahead along with us.  They have also suffered 
<br>
from the Taliban for too long.
<br>
<p>Mr. Ansary, one more thing about America.  Don't listen to AM radio.  It 
<br>
will warp your mind.
