<p>After the Horror
<br>
<p>By PAUL KRUGMAN
<br>
<p>It seems almost in bad taste to talk about dollars and cents after an act of
<br>
mass murder. Nonetheless, we must ask about the economic aftershocks from
<br>
Tuesday's horror.
<br>
<p>These aftershocks need not be major. Ghastly as it may seem to say this, the
<br>
terror attack - like the original day of infamy, which brought an end to the
<br>
Great Depression - could even do some economic good.  But there are already
<br>
ominous indications that some will see this tragedy not as an occasion for
<br>
true national unity, but as an opportunity for political profiteering.
<br>
<p>About the direct economic impact: The nation's productive base has not been
<br>
seriously damaged. Our economy is so huge that the scenes of destruction,
<br>
awesome as they are, are only a pinprick. The World Trade Center contained
<br>
12 million square feet of office space; that's out of 375 million square
<br>
feet in Manhattan alone, and 3.5 billion in the United States as a whole.
<br>
Nobody has a dollar figure for the damage yet, but I would be surprised if
<br>
the loss is more than 0.1 percent of U.S. wealth - comparable to the
<br>
material effects of a major earthquake or hurricane.
<br>
<p>The wild card here is confidence. But the confidence that matters in
<br>
this case has little to do with general peace of mind. If people rush
<br>
out to buy bottled water and canned goods, that will actually boost the
<br>
economy. For a few weeks horrified Americans may be in no mood to buy
<br>
anything but necessities. But once the shock has passed it's hard to
<br>
believe that consumer spending will be much affected.
<br>
<p>Will investors flee stocks and corporate bonds for safer assets? Such a
<br>
reaction wouldn't make much sense - after all, terrorists are not going to
<br>
blow up the S.&amp;P. 500. True, markets do sometimes react irrationally, and
<br>
some foreign markets plunged after the attack. Since then, however, they
<br>
have stabilized. On the whole it's just as well that our own markets have
<br>
stayed closed for a few days, giving investors time to calm down; the
<br>
administration was wrong to put pressure on stock markets to reopen right
<br>
away. By the time the markets do reopen, the worst panic will probably be
<br>
behind us.
<br>
<p>So the direct economic impact of the attacks will probably not be that bad.
<br>
And there will, potentially, be two favorable effects.
<br>
<p>First, the driving force behind the economic slowdown has been a plunge in
<br>
business investment. Now, all of a sudden, we need some new office
<br>
buildings. As I've already indicated, the destruction isn't big compared
<br>
with the economy, but rebuilding will generate at least some increase in
<br>
business spending.
<br>
<p>Second, the attack opens the door to some sensible recession-fighting
<br>
measures. For the last few weeks there has been a heated debate among
<br>
liberals over whether to advocate the classic Keynesian response to economic
<br>
slowdown, a temporary burst of public spending. There were plausible
<br>
economic arguments in favor of such a move, but it was questionable whether
<br>
Congress could agree on how to spend the money in time to be of any use -
<br>
and there was also the certainty that conservatives would refuse to accept
<br>
any such move unless it were tied to another round of irresponsible long-
<br>
term tax cuts. Now it seems that we will indeed get a quick burst of public
<br>
spending, however tragic the reasons.
<br>
<p>Now for the bad news. After the attacks, I found myself wondering whether
<br>
some politicians would try to exploit the horror to push their usual
<br>
partisan agendas. Then I chided myself for such an uncharitable thought. But
<br>
it seems you can't be too cynical; sure enough, the push is already on to
<br>
sell tax breaks for corporations and a cut in the capital gains tax as a
<br>
response to terrorism.
<br>
<p>One hopes that the White House will distance itself from this disgraceful
<br>
opportunism, that it will deliver the bipartisanship it originally promised.
<br>
But initial indications are not good: the administration developed its
<br>
request for emergency funding in consultation with Congressional
<br>
Republicans - full stop. A Democratic contact says that his party received
<br>
&quot;no consultation, no collaboration, virtually no information.&quot;
<br>
<p>I didn't want to mention this, but now is the time to draw the line.  This
<br>
tragedy will only be magnified if it is exploited for political gain.
<br>
Politicians who wrap themselves in the flag while relentlessly pursuing
<br>
their usual partisan agenda are not true patriots, and history will not
<br>
forgive them.
