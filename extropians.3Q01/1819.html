</em><br>
<p>Oh, okay. I'll use myself. In the mid-1980's the U.S. Internal Revenue Code
<br>
was amended so that real estate went from being a tax-favored investment to
<br>
being slightly tax-disadvantaged relative to other investments. At the same
<br>
time, the price of oil dropped drastically, which had a significant negative
<br>
impact on the economy of Texas. Prior to the mid-1980's I had a very healthy
<br>
net worth which I'd mostly accumulated by buying run-down single and
<br>
multi-family dwellings and restoring or remodeling them (I began with a $700
<br>
downpayment, which I got by saving the tips I earned working as a waitress
<br>
and night auditor at the Hyatt Regency Houston). The change in the tax law,
<br>
together with the drop in oil prices, caused the $-value of real estate to
<br>
plummet to half or less of its former $-value. Properties went on the market
<br>
cheap, often for no money down. As a result, rents fell by 50% or more.
<br>
Meanwhile, costs for taxes, insurance, maintenance, and interest remained at
<br>
their former levels (it took a while for various prices to adjust to the new
<br>
situation). Many people withdrew as much money from their businesses as
<br>
possible and then filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws. I put most
<br>
of my personal money into my business, trying to honor my company's
<br>
obligations. As a result, I ended up pretty much flat broke at the end of
<br>
the 80's.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, my husband's girlfriend got pregnant and he decided he wanted a
<br>
divorce so he could move in with her. Their kid was born with severe health
<br>
problems and my ex-husband had to deal with that and really didn't have many
<br>
resources left over for me and our daughter. The girlfriend was apparently
<br>
abusing our daughter when she stayed at her dad's house, so I had to take
<br>
full responsibility for raising her.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working 60-80 hours per week in my law office (luckily I had a law degree
<br>
to fall back on when my business went down the tubes)--trying to pay off old
<br>
debts and support me and my daughter--took it's toll on my health, and in
<br>
1991 I became very ill with bilateral pneumonia and came very close to
<br>
dying. It took over six months for me to fully recover my health, during
<br>
which period I couldn't work full time. I had to let all but two of my
<br>
employees go and scale my law practice way back.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it happened, I didn't choose to accept help from the government.
<br>
Instead, I decided to build a house and grow my own food so I could live
<br>
without much money. My daughter and I lived in a shed in my cousin's back
<br>
yard for a while. I believe this would probably qualify us as &quot;homeless.&quot;
<br>
This was not by choice, I assure you (although I have to admit, it was kinda
<br>
interesting, living in a shed). It surely would have been nice to have the
<br>
safety net of a guaranteed minimum income at that time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I built a house in the woods and hauled water from the pond in a bucket
<br>
until I got enough money to buy a pump and pvc to pipe water to the house. I
<br>
used a water heater I found in someone's trash and set it on bricks over a
<br>
wood fire for hot water until I had enough money to buy 2nd hand solar water
<br>
heating panels and a backup propane heater. And so forth.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was one of the LUCKY single parents in that I happened to have a law
<br>
degree that allowed me to make pretty good money for each hour I worked. So
<br>
I was able to get by with very limited part-time work. Also, I knew how to
<br>
use tools on account of the work I'd done remodeling and restoring houses,
<br>
and I'd been a gardener since I was a kid (and had also raised chickens and
<br>
other birds), so I knew how to grow food. Also, I tend to be somewhat
<br>
fearless with respect to taking leaps into uncertainty, which was a great
<br>
help. But I was close to the edge more than once--my story could have had a
<br>
more tragic ending, as many people's do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  You might favor a world government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that would rectify this situation.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all. See my other post where I discuss the conditions under which I
<br>
think a guaranteed minimum income would work.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Can you not suppose that I too, and many other people with whom you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disagree, are extreme opponents of suffering?
</em><br>
<p>Sure, I can. And if you say you're an opponent of suffering, I have no
<br>
reason not to believe you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You even go so far
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as to imply (by comparison) that other people do consider suffering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;beautiful or noble&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I think some people do. &quot;No gain without pain&quot; and so forth.
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt; If you are really serious about what should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be done about suffering, please read David Pearce's &quot;The Hedonistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Imerative&quot; (don't be put off by the title) at www.hedweb.com
</em><br>
<p>Thank you for the reference. I've read it and found it interesting.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;So would we all.  It's frankly a question of how high a price
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we have to pay, whether it would work, and whose rights we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to trample on to get there.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. BTW, I don't recall writing anywhere that I desire to trample
<br>
anyone's rights (I don't believe I even implied this). I either failed to
<br>
make my meaning clear, or you read something into what I wrote that wasn't
<br>
there. I arrange my own financial affairs so that I pay the least taxes
<br>
possible, and as a tax lawyer and accountant I help other people do
<br>
likewise, not only because I think the tax system is unfair, but also
<br>
because I don't approve of the way most of the money is used.
