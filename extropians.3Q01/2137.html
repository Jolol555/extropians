Just how did we get this subject heading anyway...
<br>
<p>At any rate, Anders wrote:

</em><br>
<p>Actually Anders, Aubrey de Grey has some *very* good proposals
<br>
for how to complete the evolutionary process for migrating
<br>
the remaining genes (~13-15??? in humans) from the mitochondria
<br>
into the nucleus where they will be more protected from free
<br>
radical damage.  Once completed the mitochondrial genome will
<br>
become an artifact.  (This path was obvious to me 6-8 years
<br>
ago, but Aubrey has taken the time to work out the detailed
<br>
strategies by which this might be accomplished which of course
<br>
add a lot to the concept.  As any engineer will admit -- the
<br>
devil is in the details.)
<br>
<p>Ultimately, dovetailing off of my Extro4 talk, you presumably
<br>
want a single chromosome in the nucleus responsible for energy
<br>
production.  It should be organized such that a series of viral
<br>
inloads should be able to modify elements of it &quot;on-the-fly&quot; so you
<br>
can always have the latest code at your disposal.
<br>
<p>J. R. Molloy asked:
<br>
<em>&gt; How can we modify the mitochondria in our own bodies?
</em><br>
<p>You can modify anything within your body given sufficiently
<br>
robust molecular scale engineering.  Modifying the mitochondria
<br>
is not too difficult -- one could engineer intracellular bacteria
<br>
(from which the mitochondria are derived ages ago) to replace
<br>
the mitochondria themselves in the cell.  If the engineered
<br>
mitochondrial replacments are more robust than natural mitochondria
<br>
then the normal &quot;recycling&quot; process for mitochondria will handle
<br>
the modification process for you (survival of the fittest).
<br>
<p>This is a key example of where advanced (biotech) engineering
<br>
will allow you to engineer your body before robust nanotech
<br>
engineering is available.  My best guess however at that &quot;window&quot;
<br>
where biotech trumps nanotech is very short, probably only 10-15
<br>
years.  I might be very wrong in my estimates though, so the
<br>
pursuit of biotech alternatives is useful in case the NanoSantas
<br>
get caught in the slush resulting from global warming.
