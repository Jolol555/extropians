<em>&gt; If this is re: debunking religions, the chain of thought appears (to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * I believe the EP are good ideals to follow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * I believe that a majority of religious powers (not for instance God,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;   see the popularity of ideals like the EP as eroding their power.
</em><br>
<p>I think we'll all be real happy when we are considered a threat
<br>
to the Vatican.  May that day come soon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   * I back this belief up with all kinds of evidence from history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * I therefore believe that these same religious powers direct their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   followers to hate and do bad things to people who believe ideals like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   the EP.
</em><br>
<p>You mean, like the stuff the 700 club brews up?  If ever there
<br>
were a fit for the antiChrist it would have to be Pat Robertson.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   * I back this belief up with all kinds of evidence from history, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     from recent statements and - more importantly - actions by these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     powers.
</em><br>
<p>No offense, but I think we're still too small to appear on most
<br>
of their radars.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * I therefore believe that my belief in the EP puts me in some danger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   * I believe that we are approaching a point where technology, and the

<p>I haven't noticed any great strides in understanding the human
<br>
condition coming out of science and technology.  Evolutionary
<br>
psychology is interesting and has a lot to say in some areas but
<br>
much of what is said is not too easy to test and some of it is
<br>
unfalsifiable.  I especially haven't seen a coherent ethics come
<br>
out of science and technology yet.  
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;     be so advanced as to render obvious the fallacies in these
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think you are dreaming.  There is simply too much of life
<br>
science doesn't have a good grip on yet.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   * I believe that they are aware of this oncoming time, therefore I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     believe that their self interest demands that they do everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     they can to attack technology and those who back it.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;     * I back this up with their recent statements and actions.
</em><br>
<p>Then go ahead and back it up.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   * My belief in the EP makes me a poster child technology promoter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     therefore the danger to my own life will increase significantly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     becoming one of the main dangers to such if it is not already.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     * (Some of us believe it is nowhere near that dangerous yet, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       will not be for many years to come.  The evidence from recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       events can be argued either way.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * I do not wish to be in this type and magnitude of danger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   * Therefore, I wish to take action to get myself out of danger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * Among the options that have occurred to me to resolve this problem,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   the most appealing is to hasten the demise of these religions through
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   making people no longer believe them, thus largely negating the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   religious powers' influence.
</em><br>
<p>If religion was your primary worry this might make sense.  It
<br>
isn't.  The established state and economic powers are the one's
<br>
who will notice the potential threat and act first and most
<br>
effectively.  Your energy is misdirected.   Some of the
<br>
religious focus and sentiment can actually be turned to the aid
<br>
of most of our causes with a bit of imagination.  Come out
<br>
trumpeting that you will destroy all religion though and you
<br>
will probably be squashed quite quickly.  Your more powerful
<br>
enemies will help quite happily while making it look as if it
<br>
came from the religious.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...which leads to the debate as to how to do such a thing.  Personally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my own thought chain offers a different solution: hasten debunking via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology, both by exploring how exactly this happens (a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of science can already offer much immunity from religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memes) and by getting the relevant advanced technolgies into many
</em><br>
<p>I have a good understanding of science.  Believe me, it is not
<br>
that a effective an antidote.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; peoples' hands (thus making it easier to obtain said good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding, through frequent interaction with demonstrations of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles - for instance, experiencing memories copied into one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain by purely physical processes, which would not be possible if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;soul&quot; which contained such was purely nonphysical).  A person can be
</em><br>
<p>Who says?  This would actually demonstrate very little.  And of
<br>
course we can't do this today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; silenced by a number of means (bullet, court order, inflicted poverty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.); a widely spread meme is more difficult to displace (which works
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both for and against us).
