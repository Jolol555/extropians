<em>&gt; Harvey writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Wrong.  My complaint about the white supremacists was not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; website it appeared on.  The &quot;statistics&quot; themselves were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; published by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; religious group.  They used &quot;prayer&quot; and &quot;divine guidance&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to interpret
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their results.  My complaint was not with them, their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; website, the website
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the article appeared on, or any membership affiliation.  My 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complaint was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they were using prayer to divine information and then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pass it off as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientific statistics to refute other scientific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistics.  They basically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; faked the results that &quot;God&quot; wanted them to present, rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than using any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; real scientific method to get any real results.  This is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific fraud.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I see no evidence of such fraud in this latest editorial.

Lee Corbin replied:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You see no evidence of such fraud in this latest editorial?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, did you see any evidence of fraud *in the text* of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posted article??   Sorry to post it again, but here it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where is the evidence of fraud *here*??  Where are the signs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a religious inclination even??  You're not being consistent!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---Lee Corbin
</em><br>
<p>Lee, I'm not sure what your goal is here. Do you just desperately want
<br>
Harvey to say &quot;You are right, I am wrong&quot;?
<br>
<p>I agree with you to some extent, in that the Planet of the Abes article
<br>
could not have been fraudulent in its presentation of facts. This because
<br>
there are no facts presented in the article that I can find, only
<br>
unsupported assertions. The author merely asserts statements as true;
<br>
nowhere does he appear to present any evidence to support his claims. 
<br>
<p>Harvey appears to give him the benefit of the doubt by assuming that these
<br>
assertions are grounded somewhere in something, rather than just made up off
<br>
the top of the author's head. Finding no evidence in the article to support
<br>
any of the claims, he follows the trail of references, and comes to the
<br>
conclusions that he has posted.
<br>
<p>I can't see any problem with Harvey's methodology; I am only surprised that
<br>
he is prepared to put such a lot of effort into what is, in the end, a
<br>
rather stupid opinion piece. If we all spent the time to criticise in detail
<br>
every piece of idiotic editorial on the net, we'd die trying, even giving
<br>
massive life extension, and no one would benefit from the results. But
<br>
that's just my opinion :-P
<br>
<p>Finally, can we please put a stop to the ridiculous reposting of
<br>
(ridiculous) articles over and over again?  Most here are not imbeciles, and
<br>
can follow a thread.
