&nbsp;I answered &quot;yes&quot; to all of those questions. Does this make me idealistic or
<br>
&nbsp;unrealistic? (Or possibly callous).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;I mean, answering any of those questions with anything other than yes means
<br>
&nbsp;that you believe there are some aspects of life in which people shouldn't be
<br>
&nbsp;allowed to make their own decisions; shouldn't be allowed to rise or fall on
<br>
&nbsp;their own merits. How does preventing this lead to a better society?

<p>Re draft: It's not conceivable to you that a war, if won by a particular 
<br>
side, would lead to a better outcome for humanity than if the other side won, 
<br>
and that a draft might affect the outcome?
<br>
<p>Re free speech: It's not conceivable that public airing of military or 
<br>
patented information might be bad for humanity? That it might not be in the 
<br>
best interest of humanity to allow unrestrained libel?
<br>
<p>Re borders: It's not conceivable that a completely open Mexico-U.S. border 
<br>
would lead to a mass exodus from Mexico and might just possibly have some 
<br>
deleterious effects on one or both countries?
<br>
<p>Re minimum wage: It's not conceivable that a repeal of the minimum wage might 
<br>
cause greater poverty and other unwanted effects (such as more inter-class 
<br>
strife)? Economics is no science. You ought not be so sure you know with such 
<br>
assuredness the outcome of tweaking the parameters. 
<br>
<p>Re foreign aid: It's not coneivable that foreign aid might be better in the 
<br>
long run for giver and receiver than its absence and that privately funded 
<br>
foreign aid just might not be sufficient for this betterment?
<br>
<p>Isn't it possible that you have allowed laissez faire to become the end in 
<br>
your mind rather than a means? That you just might be in the grips of an 
<br>
ideology?
