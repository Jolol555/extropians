<p><em>&gt;In my case the &quot;awe&quot; that you describe comes, I suspect,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from initimate acquaintance. (This would also fit your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having studied science for so many years.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but in my case, I'm sure it goes back many more years,
<br>
before my formal education.
<br>
<p>My childhood in the 60s was spent in Hawaii, where,
<br>
beaches/sailing/boats/Pacific ocean was a part of my family life.
<br>
(My family lived on our boat for a year, as well.)
<br>
<p>I have vivid recollections of sleeping on the deck of our boat,
<br>
watching the stars, which, as you might imagine, were brilliant
<br>
at that latitude over the Pacific Ocean. As the boat  rocked me
<br>
to sleep, the canopy of the light above me seemed to engulfed me,
<br>
I didn't think that there was any separation between me and those
<br>
stars at all. In a large sense, I felt as a child, that I _was_
<br>
those stars, and it doesn't take too much effort now as an adult
<br>
to recapture those early feelings of awe and wonder and 'oneness'
<br>
with what exists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now, I must also candidly say that there is one huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem with any such explanation or definition, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's this: many people will ADAMANTLY resist any such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reduction to concrete words or concepts for these reasons:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1. such an active reduction is itself rational/scientific,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    and therefore *itself* not emotionally compelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2. any such description is &quot;third person&quot; instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &quot;first person&quot;---hence &quot;detached&quot;, &quot;analytic&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &quot;unfeeling&quot;, and so on.
</em><br>
<p>I think that such a definition is highly individual, as you say,
<br>
and can only be accomplished by turning inward, and discovering
<br>
these aspects for oneself. I wrote quite a lot of this to Mitch
<br>
a month (two?) ago, regarding discovering one's own dreams (rather
<br>
than grabbing someone else's dreams, and following those).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Some deeper psychology may also be involved
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps...
