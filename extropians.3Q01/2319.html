Olga said:
<br>
Except to say, that if any of you so-called classical liberals
<br>
(sometimes this translates to libertarian - is this correct?) can give
<br>
me your scenario of how you would have solved the segregation problem in
<br>
the South during the 1950s and 1960s (or earlier, dare one hope?), I'll
<br>
eat my ACLU membership card.  
<br>
<p>end.
<br>
<p>Since the segregation problem was solved as a result of private lawsuits
<br>
(i.e. Brown v. Board of Education, etc.) we libertarians have no problem
<br>
with how it turned out. The federal government was acting as a monopoly
<br>
'rights insurance' adjustor at the 'reinsurance' level (rather than the
<br>
retail) where the retail insurance provider had abrogated its contracts
<br>
to a given sector of society.
<br>
<p>Libertarians generally have little or no problem with the ACLU beyond
<br>
its intransigence against helping individuals with 2nd amendment cases.
<br>
The day they do so, I will join the ACLU.
