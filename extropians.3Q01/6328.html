<p>It would be wrong to bomb countries to dust.  But it is
<br>
certainly not irrational to consider this an act of war and to
<br>
react accordingly.  All major terrorist groups that are known to
<br>
have attacked the US or its agents in the past and especially
<br>
those implicated in this atrocity must be neutralized ASAP.  I
<br>
don't support killing non-combatants and innocents where that
<br>
can be at all helped in a war situation.  But we must react with
<br>
full righeousness to an act of war such as this as war and not
<br>
just the act of a handful of zealous criminals.  Other policies
<br>
have brought us to this juncture.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You can't seriously believe that carpet bombing nations that harbor terrorists
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Leading
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens of said &quot;Bombed to dust&quot; nation, do they deserve to die purely by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accident
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of birth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>As I said, I don't support avoidable loss of civilian life even
<br>
in war.  But I believe sending the message clearly that we will
<br>
not in the least tolerate such attacks is precisely what will
<br>
most likely stop or at least severely decrease the number of
<br>
terrorist attacks on us.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I tend to believe that in all conflicts we show our values partly by acting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balanced, humane and just way than our adversaries, i don't see your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggestion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as adding to that particular meme.
</em><br>
<p>Justice demands wiping out the assholes that did this.  Pure and
<br>
simple.
