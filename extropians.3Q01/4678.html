<p>Well, my point was that quite a few transhumanists do have such notions. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A cybergnostic would do this, although many people who

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these issues very carefully and simply reflexively say

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cybergnosticism evaporates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's such a catchy term, &quot;cybergnosticism&quot;.  Can you say anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further critical about it beyond the &quot;cybergnostics&quot; think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the physical world is inherently bad?   Is there any reason that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, the problem is that to a large extent *we* are the cybergnostics -
<br>
to my knowledge there are no groups calling themselves cybergnostics in
<br>
the sense I used. 
<br>
<p>The original argument against them was made in June by Waldemar Ingdahl,
<br>
who pointed out the tendency of transhumanists to turn towards
<br>
technonaivism and cybergnosticism instead of dealing with real issues.
<br>
Thinking that technology is the solution to every problem (or the only
<br>
interesting solution) or that everything will be better in the far
<br>
future so we don't have to worry much about the present is clearly a bad
<br>
thing. I was using the term cybergnosticism in a more narrow sense to
<br>
denote a certain position about uploading (and sometimes AI) as opposed
<br>
to the physical world.
