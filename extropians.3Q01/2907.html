<em>&gt;From The Spectator, a conservative periodical, opposing stem cell research.
</em><br>
This is the kulturkampf currently building up in Europe between rationalists
<br>
and naturalists (or should they be called more accurately, romantics.
<br>
<p>Philip Chaston
<br>
<p>Read on...
<br>
<p>The sordid isolation of Britain
<br>
Throughout the world, Britain’s decision to legalise ‘therapeutic’ cloning
<br>
was seen as a giant leap towards the dehumanising of mankind. But, says
<br>
Daniel Johnson, Tony Blair was quite indifferent
<br>
<p>George W. Bush’s visit to John Paul II this week was not a summit, but a
<br>
pilgrimage. Perhaps ‘Castelgandolfo’ will enter history, as ‘Canossa’ did a
<br>
thousand years ago. Just as the Emperor Henry IV submitted to Pope Gregory
<br>
VII, so the President deferred to the Pope, the temporal lord to the
<br>
spiritual. For half an hour, the most powerful person in the world looked
<br>
like the junior partner of the man he addressed, quite sincerely, as ‘Holy
<br>
Father’. Mr Bush recognised the fact that, though the Pope has no divisions,
<br>
the modern world is ruled not by armies but by words.
<br>
<p>Did they talk about peace? Poverty? Pollution? No: the subject that weighed
<br>
most heavily on their consciences was stem cell research. President Bush is
<br>
agonising about whether to keep his campaign pledge to deny federal funds
<br>
for experiments which involve the creation, ‘harvesting’ and destruction of
<br>
embryos. Such research includes ‘therapeutic’ human cloning, from which
<br>
scientists promise to create human ‘spare parts’ and to cure degenerative
<br>
diseases, but which the Pope condemns as an ‘evil’ comparable to euthanasia
<br>
and infanticide. So sensitive is this issue in the United States that it
<br>
could set the tone for the entire Bush presidency. As I write, Congress
<br>
looks likely to pass a Bill to ban the creation of embryos by cloning. Mr
<br>
Bush is said to support the Bill.
<br>
<p>In recent months, several distinguished American visitors have impressed me
<br>
with the emphasis they place upon bioethical issues. George Weigel, the
<br>
biographer of John Paul II, told me that the absurd faith vested in genetic
<br>
research is a phenomenon of secularised religion, with its promise of
<br>
‘miracle cures’, the deification of the scientist, and the indefinite
<br>
postponement of death. ‘This is the immortality project,’ he said. This
<br>
conviction is shared by American Jews as well as Catholics. Irving Kristol
<br>
and Gertrude Himmelfarb, the founders and leading voices of
<br>
neo-conservatism, told me that they see this field as ‘the politics of the
<br>
future’.
<br>
<p>It is a measure of how seriously the President takes ‘the culture of life’
<br>
that he has even adopted the idiom of the Pope whose ‘profound’ views he
<br>
respects even when they disagree. Indeed, Mr Bush makes a point of visiting
<br>
Catholic prelates wherever he travels in the United States. Yet the
<br>
President, remember, is not a Catholic, but an evangelical Methodist.
<br>
<p>Tony Blair, by contrast, is an Anglican, perhaps even — as his biographer
<br>
John Sopel suggests — a crypto-Catholic. Yet it is almost inconceivable that
<br>
the Prime Minister would have made such a pilgrimage to sit at the feet of
<br>
an octogenarian pope — especially one of John Paul II’s uncompromising
<br>
orthodoxy — to listen to his warnings against stem cell research. Mr Blair
<br>
is just not interested in anything that a supreme pontiff might have to say
<br>
about the mass destruction of human embryos. Mr Blair does not even realise
<br>
that he has just given the green light to the genetic modification of Homo
<br>
sapiens.
<br>
<p>Britain is the first country in the world explicitly to legalise the
<br>
‘therapeutic’ cloning of human embryos, just as we were among the first to
<br>
legalise abortion. This momentous step was not even accorded the dignity of
<br>
an Act of Parliament, but was smuggled through as an amendment to a
<br>
statutory instrument, without proper debate. Having rammed it through the
<br>
Commons last December and the Lords in January, Mr Blair was quite
<br>
indifferent to the dismay it provoked throughout Europe and America. While
<br>
the British media took their cue from the government’s pretence that this
<br>
was a mere clarification of the law, the rest of the world rightly saw this
<br>
small step for genetics as a giant leap towards the dehumanising of mankind.
<br>
<p>While most British newspapers relegated the story to the inside pages, it
<br>
dominated the front page of Germany’s heavyweight broadsheet, the
<br>
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Britain was widely accused of excluding
<br>
herself from European civilisation. Reaction in the United States was no
<br>
less vehement; and, in France, President Chirac immediately assured his
<br>
countrymen that France would not follow Britain’s lead and called for an
<br>
international ban on all human cloning; last month the French government
<br>
proposed a ban on human cloning ‘for research purposes’. Even the Dutch, who
<br>
have legalised euthanasia, have no plans to follow Britain’s example.
<br>
<p>Of course, there were those who approved. Severino Antinori, the maverick
<br>
Italian professor who has promised to clone human babies for infertile
<br>
couples, was among those who praised to the skies ‘Tony Blair’s intelligent
<br>
decision’.
<br>
<p>Those respectable scientists who have already cloned animals, and who know
<br>
the terrible abnormalities it is almost certain to engender in the few
<br>
cloned foetuses that do not spontaneously abort, agree with the leading
<br>
American expert Professor Rudolf Jaenisch in condemning human cloning as ‘an
<br>
outrageous criminal enterprise to even attempt’. The British Human
<br>
Fertilisation and Embryology Authority joined in the chorus, but Professor
<br>
Antinori is correct in supposing that the Prime Minister’s advocacy of
<br>
therapeutic cloning has helped to legitimise reproductive cloning.
<br>
<p>Mr Blair, in short, is a bioethical Little Englander. He divorces his
<br>
Christian beliefs from his actions and subordinates moral imperatives to
<br>
political or economic ones. This is his most considered attempt to justify
<br>
therapeutic cloning, in a speech to the European Bioscience Conference last
<br>
November: ‘Our conviction about what is natural or right should not inhibit
<br>
the role of science in discovering the truth; rather it should inform our
<br>
judgment about the implications and consequences of the truth science
<br>
uncovers. We should also realise that there are areas where even in
<br>
exercising such judgment, there is more than one morally acceptable outcome.
<br>
’
<br>
<p>What this appears to mean is that mora-lity must not be permitted to
<br>
‘inhibit’ research; that there are no moral absolutes; and that it is
<br>
acceptable to treat unborn life as a means to an end. For Mr Blair that end
<br>
is not primarily the ethical one of alleviating human suffering — though
<br>
even this could not justify the cannibalistic dismemberment of the unborn
<br>
for the sake of adults. It is the political and economic one of keeping
<br>
‘Britain at the forefront of world science’. The use of a racing metaphor to
<br>
justify a form of human sacrifice indicates moral idiocy. This is what the
<br>
Pope had in mind in his warning to President Bush: ‘Experience is already
<br>
showing how a tragic coarsening of consciences accompanies the assault on
<br>
innocent human life in the womb.’
<br>
<p>When Mr Blair was asked by Roger Highfield, the Daily Telegraph’s science
<br>
editor, whether the Blairs would be prepared to donate their own embryos for
<br>
stem cell research, he declined ‘to get into this very personal question’.
<br>
He was not, in other words, prepared to apply his policies to himself.
<br>
<p>The British treat bioethics as a matter of taste. There is an unspoken
<br>
agreement among senior politicians in this country to exclude anything that
<br>
smacks of American pro-life versus pro-choice politics. Though it is among
<br>
the commonest operations performed by the NHS, abortion is never treated as
<br>
a normal political issue. If it were, the strong correlation between
<br>
abortion and breast cancer might have received a proper airing. The same
<br>
fastidiousness applies to abortifacient drugs, such as the ‘morning after’
<br>
pill, which the government has now made available to teenagers over the
<br>
counter without proper warnings about the health risks.
<br>
<p>Likewise, the creation of hundreds of thousands of embryos purely for
<br>
experimentation since the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 has
<br>
scarcely figured in public consciousness. There has been no cost-benefit
<br>
analysis of the scientific case that swayed the Warnock committee in favour
<br>
of permitting embryo research. Such an analysis would have revealed that
<br>
there have been few, if any, medical advances as a result of a decade of
<br>
such experiments, let alone practical benefits for patients. IVF, the one
<br>
(heavily qualified) success story, could have been permitted without giving
<br>
researchers carte blanche to treat embryos as a disposable means to a
<br>
dubious end. But the absence of public debate saved boffins and bigwigs from
<br>
the embarrassment of a proper audit.
<br>
<p>And so, when the issues of embryonic stem cell research and cloning surfaced
<br>
in the late 1990s, most politicians again accepted uncritically the claims
<br>
made by scientists, many of them representing large commercial interests.
<br>
Cures were promised for everything from Alzheimer’s to Parkinson’s; the onus
<br>
was placed on those who opposed such research to justify ‘denying’ new
<br>
treatments to desperately ill patients.
<br>
<p>The British, as usual, paid heed not to mad scientists but to bad
<br>
scientists. Never mind the fact that ‘spare body parts’ can be grown from
<br>
adult stem cells and that cells taken from the umbilical cord share many
<br>
embryonic features, or that stem cells are plentifully available from other
<br>
adult tissue including liposuctioned fat (what one US commentator drily
<br>
called ‘our nation’s most plentiful resource).
<br>
<p>Never mind the fact that embryonic stem cells appear far less suitable for
<br>
the kind of purposes scientists are seeking, as they are notoriously
<br>
unstable — ‘hard to rein in’, as one American bioethicist puts it.
<br>
<p>Never mind the fact that in America (unlike Britain) the scientific
<br>
consensus in favour of adult stem cell research and against unreliable
<br>
embryonic cell research is so clear that the former attracts ample private
<br>
investment, whereas embryo research is obliged to seek federal funds.
<br>
<p>Never mind the fact that the inevitable consequence of legalising
<br>
‘therapeutic’ cloning was that some scientists would be emboldened to press
<br>
on with ‘reproductive’ cloning.
<br>
<p>So the British political, medical and pharmaceutical establishments
<br>
presented a united front to the public. The only dissenting voice came from
<br>
the Churches and other faiths. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the
<br>
Cardinal Archbishops of Westminster and Glasgow, Evangelicals and Baptists,
<br>
Free Church and Greek Orthodox spokesmen, the Chief Rabbi, leaders of the
<br>
Muslims and Sikhs all requested a meeting with the Prime Minister. Any one
<br>
of these clerics would have been granted access to the Bush White House
<br>
without delay. But the united representatives of Britain’s multi-faith,
<br>
multi-ethnic, multi-cultural society were snubbed no fewer than four times
<br>
by Mr Blair. In the end, they addressed an open letter to the House of
<br>
Lords, pleading merely for time to reflect, only to be snubbed again, this
<br>
time by the government whips, who worked overtime to ensure that the
<br>
legislation should not be impeded by a mere ‘free vote’.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, in Germany, ‘intellectual civil war’ has raged for the past few
<br>
months. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has appointed a permanent commission of
<br>
experts to advise him on bioethical issues, and he seems to be impressed by
<br>
Mr Blair’s refusal to allow moral objections to ‘inhibit’ scientific
<br>
progress. But public opinion in Germany is still deeply suspicious of
<br>
anything that reminds them of a master race.
<br>
<p>That, according to the Oxford philosopher Professor Sir Michael Dummett, is
<br>
one of the strongest objections to cloning: the creation of a Western elite,
<br>
genetically perfected, which could lord it over the rest of humanity.
<br>
Chancellor Schroeder’s guru, Juergen Habermas, has asked for scientists to
<br>
treat the embryo as if it were looking over one’s shoulder: could one
<br>
justify one’s research to the victim?
<br>
<p>Most Germans understand that what was wrong with Nazi eugenics was not
<br>
simply its cruelty; it was treating the individual as a means to a
<br>
collective end. Americans, many of whom fled from the Nazis, grasp this too.
<br>
So do most Continental Europeans, whether Catholic or Protestant. Only in
<br>
Britain do politicians suppose that it is ‘utilitarian’ to sacrifice the
<br>
individual for some notional social end — though only the vulgarisers of
<br>
Bentham and Mill ever taught this. Any utilitarian calculus would reveal
<br>
that the risks of eugenics far outweigh the benefits. Can it be right that,
<br>
to satisfy the primaeval urge of a self-selected elite to see their genes
<br>
perpetuated, the entire natural order should be inverted?
<br>
<p>And so the British — despite their instinctive revulsion for human cloning —
<br>
acquiesce in our sordid isolation. We are indeed leading the world; leading
<br>
it in an unheard-of abdication of responsibility, the hubris of inhumanity.
<br>
The nation of Burke has trampled underfoot the unwritten contract between
<br>
the living and the unborn. The present generation has no right to
<br>
instrumentalise the next, merely in order to prolong its own longevity. The
<br>
selfish gene has become a selfish genie, now too late to rebottle. Britain
<br>
is the laboratory in which posterity is sacrificed for the illusion of
<br>
immortality.
