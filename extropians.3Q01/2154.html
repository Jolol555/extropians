<p><em>&gt;Brian, guaranteed income isn't the same as welfare as we know it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the U.S. I'm sorry I don't have time to write more about it at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the moment. I'll try to when I have a moment, maybe next week. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt;now, take a look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.odyssey.on.ca/~balancebeam/dadless/badwelfare.htm">http://www.odyssey.on.ca/~balancebeam/dadless/badwelfare.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p>I of course realize this, I was using the comparison to welfare to
<br>
indicate that they have the same problem, i.e. those on the dole
<br>
quickly become addicted (economic addicts) and to be honest,
<br>
slothful. The few who could, and possibly would, use it wisely do
<br>
not justify the huge social costs.
<br>
<p>Besides, I have no intention of paying for it.
<br>
<p>I will look at your reference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As you'll guess from the excerpt below, it's a negative article.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But rather than conclude, without further thought, that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guaranteed income would never work, it might be more useful to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make an effort to see WHY there would be problems with it in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;present-day U.S. 
</em><br>
<p>I just see it as human nature, given the opportunity to become
<br>
lazy, most of us will. The evidence supports this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Given the high likelihood that many people will find themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without jobs in the near future, it might be especially helpful to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;critically consider the idea that most people in our culture find
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a purpose in life only from working for wages or a salary, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that getting a paying job is the only purpose of education.
</em><br>
<p>In this case I say we extend unemployment if we need to. There is
<br>
a big difference between a safety net program, especially one
<br>
you've essentially paid for, and a handout.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;With respect to families, as a former volunteer for a women's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shelter which provided emergency help for battered women, I find
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it interesting to note that families broke up as a result of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guaranteed income. Given the large number of women and children
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I've seen trapped in unimaginably horrible marriages for economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reasons, I'd venture to suggest that the breakup of families can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;often be a very good thing.
</em><br>
<p>This is obviously two separate yet related problems.
<br>
<p>Welfare is still available for I believe two years, and other funds
<br>
could be made available. As I said there is a big difference
<br>
between safety net type programs and a guaranteed income (handout).
<br>
<p>So far the only plus reason I've found is the notion that large
<br>
numbers of minimum wage workers would drop out of the economy, the
<br>
Hillarys of the world would have to clean there own houses, watch
<br>
their own children, and cut their own grass. 
<br>
<p>I give that effect +1.
