<p><em>&gt;&gt;&quot;You claim tire installers are making 50K? how about some proof,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and by the way if it wasn't worth it the company wouldn't pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;it....&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;They dont, instead they close up shop and move south, where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same job can be performed just as well in a cheaper environment. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then, of course, everyone complains that these greedy corporations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are stealing jobs from the US and giving them to mexico, of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these same people turn around and buy cheap imported clothed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;electronics goods, and cars.  Very few of them are willing to pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the extra money for a product required to pay the average american
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worker.  
</em><br>
<p>Well, there are still some cars made here.
<br>
<p>I still make a very concentrated effort to buy American simply
<br>
because It's important to me that my fellow citizens are gainfully
<br>
employed. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&quot;Either a monopoly or a monopsony can control the price of either
</em><br>
<em>&gt;goods or labor.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;only to a limited extent, see my previous objections to monopolies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and price fixing.
</em><br>
<p>I am refering to a perfect monopoly. (theoretical)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But those things never last.  Even when price fixing, say four
</em><br>
<em>&gt;companies get together and agree to charge $5 for thier product,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which cost $1 to manufacture and distribute, they now share the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;market equally.  It will always be in one of the companies best
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interest to undercutt the others.  If those four companies each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shared 25% of the market then it would be in one of the companies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;best interest to now charge $4 for thier product since they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may take a far greater percentage of the market.  If the market is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not equally shared by all companies, then it is not in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;companies that are not recieving an equal share's best interest to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continue with that agreement.  Also, other companies who might not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be making a competing product would then decide to since they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could undercutt all the price fixing competitors and take the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whole market.  In this way price fixing never lasts, and it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never go past a certain point in price anway.  If all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;companies who sell milk decided to charge $4 a gallon, would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still drink it?  $8?  $32?  There is always a limit that anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will pay for a product, even in a monopoly the price is kept in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;check.  
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me but your examplr describes a cartel, not a monopoly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Lets try a modern day example. Suppose Microsoft was the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;software company in the world. Do you think anyone would be getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;stock options and bonuses or relocation allowances, or would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;programmers be working for minimum wage.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Do you think those people would continue working for microsoft? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or would they quit and start thier own software company?  Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think that other companies wouldnt then decide to enter the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;software market given the potential profit margins? 
</em><br>
<p>For the point of discussion I was asking for the assumption that
<br>
there was only one company. My points are valid within that
<br>
assumption. I know this isn't a real world scenario, it was a
<br>
simplification.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Pointing out why free markets wont work by imagining a world where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only one producer is allowed isnt valid, as no such world would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exist.
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't attempting any such thing, I was demonstrating the control
<br>
possible under a monopoly.
