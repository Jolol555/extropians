<p>
Amara has coherantly described not only what &quot;syncronicity&quot;,
<br>
but also what &quot;spirituality&quot;, mean to her; no small achievement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Lee, does this help you to understand how some of us might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; define spirituality?)
</em><br>
<p>But it's probably also clear from what you and Samantha
<br>
have written, that the meanings of these terms will
<br>
remain highly personal and non-objective.  Even more
<br>
evidence for this comes from the way that I could relate
<br>
to quite a bit of what you'd written, but (for better or
<br>
for worse) never even coming close to utilizing the 
<br>
notion of &quot;spirituality&quot;, and certainly not &quot;religiosity&quot;.
<br>
<p>There are a huge number of things that engender similar
<br>
feelings in me.  I could talk here and at this point about
<br>
music, math, history, civilization, some sciences, chess,
<br>
Go, and perhaps a few other things.  (&quot;Old movies&quot; have
<br>
perhaps only in the last weeks begun to generate feelings
<br>
in me that might cause me to add them to the list.)  In
<br>
my case the &quot;awe&quot; that you describe comes, I suspect,
<br>
from initimate acquaintance. (This would also fit your
<br>
having studied science for so many years.)
<br>
<p>Honestly compels me to state, for what it's worth, however,
<br>
that I do not experience nearly to the same degree (that
<br>
you do) any reverance for nature, living beings as such,
<br>
or for the universe.
<br>
<p>So are we homing in, by any chance at all, on a mutually
<br>
useful meaning?  That is, it sounds to me that &quot;spirituality&quot;
<br>
might be for many of us---certainly not all---the following:
<br>
<p>Spirituality:  a deep appreciation of something so emotionally
<br>
compelling that it becomes a form of reverance.
<br>
<p>Now, I must also candidly say that there is one huge
<br>
problem with any such explanation or definition, and
<br>
it's this:  many people will ADAMANTLY resist any such
<br>
reduction to concrete words or concepts for these reasons:
<br>
<p>1.  such an active reduction is itself rational/scientific,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and therefore *itself* not emotionally compelling
<br>
<p>2.  any such description is &quot;third person&quot; instead of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;first person&quot;---hence &quot;detached&quot;, &quot;analytic&quot;,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;unfeeling&quot;, and so on.  (Those same people will,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for example, frequently insist that first person
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consciousness or pain can never be explained.)
<br>
<p>Some deeper psychology may also be involved, and relates
<br>
to a statistical difference between men and women.  (It's
<br>
no coincidence, according to this observation, that the
<br>
main defenders of &quot;spirituality&quot; here have been women.)
<br>
Some of us just do not *feel* it appropriate to discuss
<br>
our *feelings* about nature, or chess, or old movies, or
<br>
the universe.  It seems wrong or inappropriate.  It can
<br>
even seem boring, as in, &quot;why the hell would anyone want
<br>
to hear me rhapsodize about Tschaikovsky?&quot;  We have, for
<br>
peculiar psychological reasons, some disdain for (vain?)
<br>
attempts to use what we see as a third-person vehicle---
<br>
namely the spoken and written word---to attempt to &quot;convey&quot;
<br>
feelings.  Was it perhaps non-selective on the hunt?  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just as I have to respect every event in my life that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shaped my current existence, I respect every process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that shaped the existence of everything else, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really feel honored that I was asked (?) to participate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the unfolding of the Universe's events, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm a part of it all.
</em><br>
<p>I occasionally am overwhelmed too about how wonderful it is
<br>
to have gotten to live.  (One could, by the way, point out
<br>
that you don't really mean &quot;every process that shaped the
<br>
existence of everything else&quot; by alluding to horrible
<br>
processes and events, but your meaning is clear.)
<br>
<p>So it comes down to this:  the people who claim to be
<br>
spiritual in most cases (a) have a deep appreciation of
<br>
of things, probably foremost among them the universe 
<br>
itself, to the point of reverance, and (b) feel inclined
<br>
to talk about it, or to communicate it.
<br>
<p>People who have no use for &quot;spirituality&quot; or &quot;religiosity&quot;
<br>
usually---although perhaps having equally deep appreciation
<br>
(or perhaps not, who can really say?)---hardly ever feel
<br>
worshipful, reverent, or deeply respectful (of non-sentience).
<br>
Moreover, they feel awkward or even self-indulgent when
<br>
trying to communicate such appreciations or profound feelings.
<br>
