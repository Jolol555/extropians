<p>
Of course I dont think it absolutely necessary to point out that if one
<br>
company lays of workers and gives the money to a CEO they will be less able
<br>
to compete with another company that spends that money more effeciently on
<br>
thier employees or procedurs for developing thier products.  Notice this is
<br>
mentioned in the article... 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;But not all executives are cashing in, especially those who work at some of
<br>
Seattle's smaller publicly held companies. &quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;Executives at RealNetworks excluded themselves from pay raises in May, two
<br>
months before the company cut 140 employees.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Bsquare Corp. CEO Bill Baxter, who makes $250,000 per year, took a 20
<br>
percent pay cut and eliminated his incentive compensation last month. Other
<br>
executives at the Bellevue company agreed to a 10 percent pay cut to reduce
<br>
expenses and avoid layoffs.&quot;
<br>
<p>Is it not obvious that if two companies have Identical overhead and one has
<br>
20% more employees while the other has 20% fewer employees and a CEO that
<br>
makes 20% more money that one will be a much greater competitor?  Please
<br>
point out the fallacy in this logic...
<br>
<p>I had already mentioned why the 'CEO makes too much money' argument against
<br>
free markets does not work, but I have re-iterated it in this post since it
<br>
has been brough up again.  CEO's have difficult jobs and have to make
<br>
difficult decisions (the most difficult in the company in fact) and they get
<br>
paid accordingly.  But if they make too much, that company can not compete
<br>
in a market with another company that pays a similiar CEO less.  
<br>
<p>Regards...

CEOs are rewarded for laying off workers 
<br>
<p>Wednesday, August 29, 2001
<br>
<p>By MARCY GORDON
<br>
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
<br>
<p>WASHINGTON -- As the economy began to stall last year and companies laid off
<br>
workers, chief executives of big corporations still got hefty pay raises and
<br>
were rewarded for making job cuts, according to a new study by two liberal
<br>
advocacy groups.
<br>
<p>A &quot;decade of greed&quot; in the 1990s was followed last year by a particularly
<br>
&quot;blatant pattern of CEOs benefiting at the expense of their workers,&quot; the
<br>
Institute for Policy Studies and United for a Fair Economy said in their
<br>
latest annual pay survey released yesterday.
<br>
<p>It found that chief executives of the 52 major companies that announced
<br>
layoffs of at least 1,000 employees in the first half of 2000 earned about
<br>
80 percent more on average than CEOs at 365 big corporations surveyed by
<br>
Business Week magazine. The &quot;layoff leaders&quot; received an average $23.7
<br>
million in total compensation, including bonuses and stock options, compared
<br>
with an average $13.1 million for CEOs overall, the groups' study found.
<br>
<p>It said the top job cutters got an average increase in salary and bonus of
<br>
nearly 20 percent last year, compared with average raises for U.S. wage
<br>
earners of around 3 percent and 4 percent increases for salaried employees.
<br>
<p>Sarah Anderson, director of the global economy program at the Washington,
<br>
D.C.-based Institute for Policy Studies, said it was galling &quot;especially in
<br>
this period of economic downturn as people are feeling very insecure about
<br>
their jobs, to see that the guys at the top have cushioned themselves.&quot;
<br>
<p>But not all executives are cashing in, especially those who work at some of
<br>
Seattle's smaller publicly held companies. 
<br>
<p>Executives at RealNetworks excluded themselves from pay raises in May, two
<br>
months before the company cut 140 employees.
<br>
<p>Bsquare Corp. CEO Bill Baxter, who makes $250,000 per year, took a 20
<br>
percent pay cut and eliminated his incentive compensation last month. Other
<br>
executives at the Bellevue company agreed to a 10 percent pay cut to reduce
<br>
expenses and avoid layoffs.
<br>
<p>But in many cases, leaders of large corporations are rewarded for cutting
<br>
staff.
<br>
<p>One of the &quot;layoff leaders&quot; cited by the study is Michael Bonsignore,
<br>
Honeywell International Inc.'s chief executive until last month, who is
<br>
receiving a severance package worth nearly $10 million, plus generous
<br>
pension checks. He was ousted by the big manufacturer's board of directors
<br>
July 3, the same day the European Union blocked Honeywell's anticipated
<br>
merger with General Electric.
<br>
<p>Honeywell announced in the spring that it would lay off 850 workers because
<br>
of a significant downturn in the circuit-board industry.
<br>
<p>A Honeywell spokesman, who declined to be identified by name, said yesterday
<br>
that there was &quot;no relationship&quot; between the job cuts and Bonsignore's
<br>
compensation. He declined further comment.
<br>
<p>&quot;Rightly or wrongly, the cutting of staff has tended to give a boost to a
<br>
company's stock,&quot; said Charles Peck, a compensation specialist at the
<br>
Conference Board, a business research and networking organization. &quot;It's one
<br>
of the ways that Wall Street evaluates top executives' performance.&quot;
<br>
<p>The New York-based Conference Board's executive pay survey for 2000 shows
<br>
little change from 1999, Peck said. It shows median total compensation for
<br>
800 manufacturing CEOs of around $1.7 million in both years.
<br>
<p>The yearlong economic slump is taking a toll on the nation's labor markets.
<br>
Thursday, the government reported that the number of laid-off workers
<br>
drawing unemployment benefits had hit a nine-year high. The Labor Department
<br>
said the number of Americans collecting jobless benefits rose to 3.18
<br>
million in the week ending Aug. 11, the highest level since September 1992,
<br>
when the country was struggling to emerge from the last recession.
<br>
<p>Against that backdrop, compensation packages for executives have drawn some
<br>
criticism.
<br>
<p>A shareholder of US Airways Group Inc. has sued the airline's board of
<br>
directors, seeking to overturn a provision that would give $45 million in
<br>
severance benefits to its top three executives if they decided to resign.
<br>
<p>In the lawsuit made public Monday, shareholder Steven Rosenberg said the
<br>
severance provision -- part of US Airways' failed plan to merge with United
<br>
Airlines -- was &quot;unconscionable&quot; and would encourage the three executives to
<br>
leave, The Washington Post reported in yesterday's editions.
<br>
<p>The survey also said:
<br>
<p><p><p>*	If the federal minimum wage, which was $3.80 an hour in 1990, had
<br>
grown at the same rate as executive pay over the decade, it now would be
<br>
$25.50 an hour as opposed to the current $5.15. 
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p>*	The 30 highest-paid women in big corporations each earned average
<br>
total compensation of $8.7 million last year, compared with $112.9 million
<br>
for the 30 highest-paid men.
