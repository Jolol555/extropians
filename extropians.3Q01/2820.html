<em>&gt; Oh, by all means, let's RE-POST the entire article.
</em><br>
<p>Well, OK, if you insist:
<br>
<p>Fred Plops For Reparations
<br>
Sells Out To Johnny Cochran
<br>
<p>I see by the papers in the Yankee Capital that Johnny Cochran, and of course
<br>
Jesse and Al, are wheezing and blowing like a county-fair calliope with a
<br>
leaky boiler. They always are. This time it was about the need to pay
<br>
reparations for the ravages trala of slavery. It got me to thinking.
<br>
I hate it when that happens.
<br>
<p>Now, I know I'm hard-hearted, and mean-spirited, and no damn good. It's
<br>
probably my only virtue. But on consideration, I realized that they might be
<br>
right. The ravages of slavery do run deep, and cause motingator trouble, with
<br>
no end in sight. I decided that compensation was only reasonable. Sometimes
<br>
you don't like a conclusion, but you have to reach it. All right. I'll be a
<br>
man about it.
<br>
<p>You can pay me reparations, Johnny.
<br>
<p>To start with, I figure you owe me for three bicycles. Maybe it's a small
<br>
thing, but I'm tired of losing bicycles. Are we talking market value or
<br>
replacement? What I really want to be paid for is having to keep my latest
<br>
two-wheeler in my living room. Do you know how many times I've knocked the
<br>
fool thing over? And, oh, the scratch in my granddad's antique desk that the
<br>
brake lever made. What's that worth?
<br>
<p>Call it three grand. OK? Direct deposit would be nice.
<br>
<p>But . . . how do we dollarize cultural retrogression? God knows I appreciate
<br>
your offer of reparations, but I'm having trouble with the arithmetic. Help
<br>
me.
<br>
<p>A few years back, my middle-school daughter brought home a horrendously
<br>
misspelled science hand-out. Now, Johnny: You and I both know that it's easy
<br>
to make a typo, and write &quot;phenylkeetone&quot; instead of &quot;phenylketone.&quot; But
<br>
&quot;feemelkeebome&quot; is stretching it. The errors were of this sort. An
<br>
understanding of chemistry clearly had never rippled the serene surface of the
<br>
woman's mind.
<br>
<p>Without thinking, I asked, &quot;What color is your teacher?&quot; (If I had thought
<br>
carefully, I would have asked, &quot;What color is your teacher?&quot;) My daughter
<br>
responded with an anguished, &quot;Da-d-d-d-y!&quot; She had made the connection, but
<br>
knew she wasn't supposed to.
<br>
<p>I've got no problem with black teachers, if they are competent. No problem at
<br>
all. But a teacher who is too ignorant to spell her subject, and too lazy to
<br>
use a dictionary, ought to be flipping burgers. Simple burgers, with no moving
<br>
parts. Thing is, we can't fire ignorant teachers, Johnny, because of the
<br>
lingering effects of slavery. I can yell at an ignorant white teacher, but not
<br>
at a black one. To expect blacks to meet standards is racist. You can send me
<br>
the price of four years of tuition in a private school outside the country.
<br>
<p>What's the cost of permanent welfare? Subsidized everything? Enormous police
<br>
departments? What do you figure? Just add it to your tab. Have you thought
<br>
about setting up an endowment?
<br>
<p>But here's a large ravage of slavery, Johnny: Fear.
<br>
<p>What price do we put on looking over our shoulders? On watching to be sure we
<br>
don't go one subway stop too far? Warning our girlfriends not to drive on
<br>
certain streets? Checking the clientele of Seven-Eleven before going in at
<br>
night?
<br>
<p>People in, say, Switzerland can walk their streets after dark. We can't. Why?
<br>
What have we got that they don't, that might cause fear?
<br>
<p>Elvis impersonators, Johnny. Yep. Switzerland doesn't have any Elvis
<br>
impersonators. Check for yourself.
<br>
<p>What's fear worth? Is it a minimum-wage job? Forty-hour week or twenty-four
<br>
hours a day? Benefits? Seniority pay as people grow older, weaker, and less
<br>
able to defend themselves? You see the actuarial difficulty. Accounting is a
<br>
more difficult trade than you might think.
<br>
<p>The white guy beaten to death 100 yards from my door last year - they never
<br>
caught the killers, but - what you reckon, Johnny? Do you figure it was white
<br>
Presbyterian women from the old-ladies' home? That's my guess. That's who
<br>
usually does it. Anyway, you can send me $540 for the Sig 9mm pistol I bought
<br>
after blacks started moving into the neighborhood and crime went up. And ammo,
<br>
carry permit, Hydra-Shock rounds.
<br>
<p>Now, millions of honest blacks might write and say, &quot;Fred, we aren't
<br>
criminals. Why should we pay for what other blacks do?&quot; Splendid question. But
<br>
of course whites say, &quot;We don't have any slaves. Why should we pay for what
<br>
some other whites did?&quot; If it is a reasonable question for blacks to ask, as
<br>
indeed it is, why isn't it a reasonable question for whites to ask?
<br>
<p>But while you are in a mood to pay up, Johnny, let me introduce a useful
<br>
concept: Civilizational rent. You'll like this. It's such a good idea.
<br>
<p>A culture is essentially software. No? Sure, there are physical embodiments:
<br>
positron-emission scanners, high-bypass turbofans, radar with Doppler
<br>
beam-sharpening. Yet basically a culture is a body of knowledge, like
<br>
Microsoft Word. (All right, throw in values. But I don't want to make this too
<br>
difficult.)
<br>
<p>White guys invented these things at considerable cost. We had to. Europe doesn
<br>
't have much low-hanging fruit, and it gets cold in the north. So generations
<br>
of people that I'm sure you're familiar with - Newton, Leibniz, Galois, Gauss,
<br>
Carnot, Dirac - did work that led to all kinds of useful . . . you know . .
<br>
stuff.
<br>
<p>Western civilization, it's called.
<br>
<p>As a result of slavery, you have been using our civilization without a
<br>
license. (I know: You're having trouble with the idea of implied retroactive
<br>
acceptance of a license I invented five minutes ago. Microsoft would grasp it
<br>
in a heartbeat. Anyway, I'm writing the column.)
<br>
<p>Further, you've been using it for a long time, Johnny. Air-conditioning.
<br>
Roads. Writing. The wheel. Complicated stuff like that. Medicine. Tractors.
<br>
Shoes. Houses. I've spent time in Africa, where people live in stick things
<br>
that look as if a Cub Scout had built a campfire and forgotten to light it.
<br>
You're getting a deal here, Johnny.
<br>
<p>I don't wish stick houses on anyone. I'm glad you have the benefits of
<br>
electricity, clothes, and daytime TV. I'd love to see blacks study, earn
<br>
degrees on their merits, prosper. Think of the trouble it would save. But - as
<br>
suggested by your manly desire to pay reparations -- you owe us licensing
<br>
fees. Granted, it's hard to set a price on a culture. But if Microsoft Office
<br>
goes for $250 at fire-sale prices, I guess a whole civilization is cheap at
<br>
$100K a copy.
<br>
<p>I believe we can do business, Johnny. I hope so. I can use the money.
<br>
