<p><p><em>&gt;OK, I'll take your minarchist state. Works fine. But then add some valuable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;services that recognize commonly used contracts. These laws are to be used 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as &quot;default&quot; contracts, recognized by the state unless something else has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been signed. If you want to trade with my company and don't want to obey 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Corporation Act, just negotiate a new contract. (Now that's is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fully possible today.)
</em><br>
<p>Well, I have a few problems with this. Eg what is the justification for such 
<br>
a modification to contract law which seems to shift bargaining power in a 
<br>
particular direction at the direction of the state? However, Mike has 
<br>
answered your post point by point and I will not do so, since I think he has 
<br>
said a lot of the obvious things in response, as well as some that I am 
<br>
scratching my head about.
<br>
<p>Intead, I want to make clear that it's not &quot;my minarchist state&quot;. I don't 
<br>
actually subscribe to any version of a minarchist state (even though I am a 
<br>
strong advocate of the value of freedom and I can therefore see at least 
<br>
some attractions in libertarianism). I'm really just asking questions about 
<br>
what values, ethical commitments, political analysis, etc, underpin various 
<br>
libertarian or minarchist view expressed on this list.
<br>
<p>I'm asking the questions for at least two reasons: (1) I have an 
<br>
intellectual interest in all this stuff, so I'd simply like to know what 
<br>
people think, just out of interest; (2) I see some very strong, even 
<br>
impassioned,  statements made from time to time by Jerry, among others, and 
<br>
I'd like to know whether there is any political theory (fully developed or 
<br>
otherwise) behind those statements or whether they merely express an 
<br>
emotional aversion to paying taxes. The questions I'm asking are some of 
<br>
those that I think a proper theory would have to deal with.
<br>
<p>I suppose a third point is that it's just possible that we may at some stage 
<br>
need some detailed political theory to underpin transhumanism. I really hope 
<br>
not and I applaud the Extropian Principles for allowing a range of views as 
<br>
long as there's an open society.
<br>
<p>However, take an example. I disagree with laws being passed to ban stem cell 
<br>
research. I am willing to campaign against such laws being passed (and have 
<br>
been doing so in a small way). If they are passed, I am willing to campaign 
<br>
for their repeal (and would doubtless do so on some scale or other). 
<br>
However, if such laws are actually passed, should I recognise their 
<br>
legitimacy while campaigning against them? Should I encourage people to 
<br>
break such laws? Or is it more important to protect the integrity of the 
<br>
system of legal norms? I don't think these questions have arisen in practice 
<br>
as yet, but I suppose they could. Even if we are just interested in them 
<br>
intellectually, we'd need a theory of political obligation and related 
<br>
matters to solve them. So I'm interested to find out what theories people 
<br>
are actually working with.
<br>
<p>(Again, speaking for myself, I would not consider such laws somehow morally 
<br>
null and void. I'd just consider that they should be repealed. I might, 
<br>
however, be prepared to contribute in some way to lawful attempts to avoid 
<br>
them, such as by helping people set up research in a jurisdiction where it 
<br>
is not banned. There may well be other views about this.)
<br>
<p>I don't claim to be a libertarian, except in some small-l sense that would 
<br>
include just about everyone on this list and Noam Chomsky to boot. I am 
<br>
someone who has an interest in libertarianism, a lot of Enlightenment 
<br>
liberal intuitions, some curiosity, and a worry about any theory that might 
<br>
require us to re-shape our intuitions to the point where we lack compassion.
<br>
<p>Cheers
<br>
<p>Russell
