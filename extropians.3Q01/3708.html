Natasha said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Reason, be reasonable -:)  If you are a transhuman by some other more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advanced technology, a chip in your brain that gives you more processing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power, then the out-dated contact lens would not keep you from being a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhuman just because it is antiquated.  I hope this is clear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now, with that said, tool-users are folks who use tools. As for the great 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leap in your thinking -- &quot;... makes us transhuman for the duration of that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attempt?...&quot;  Well this depends.  If you have one robotic leg, a brain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enhancer for processing power, and a robotic eye that can see through walls 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one year and then three days later you have an entirely new body that is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;engineered with nanotechnology and AI, yes you would be a transhuman is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transition.  BUT, if you use a hammer one day and a screwdriver to tighten 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the valves on your car the next day, and *then* have a spanking new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;upgraded nano-driven body on the third day, I'd have to say that you have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been a transhuman for only that day my friend.  But, this is only my view.
</em><br>
<p>In the intellectual world outside of transhumanist philosophy, the word 
<br>
&quot;cyborg&quot; often seems to be used in much the same way as Natasha is using 
<br>
&quot;transhuman&quot;. OTOH, it has a much more spectacular sense in the science 
<br>
fiction community, where it refers to a far more transformed being than 
<br>
someone with, say, contact lenses. I wouldn't ever describe myself as a 
<br>
cyborg even if it is technically correct according to some academic usage.
<br>
<p>I'm prepared to accept that Natasha's definition of a transhuman is 
<br>
historically correct, but I do think that Eliezer has raised a legitimate 
<br>
presentational issue. Also, I'm not sure that the meaning can be held in 
<br>
place as the word becomes more widely used.
<br>
<p>I'm probably also guilty of heresy when I often say that the contraceptive 
<br>
pill was the first genuinely transhuman technology. I say it, FWIW, because 
<br>
it is a technology that reprograms bodily functioning at a pretty deep level 
<br>
and in relation to a central area of the historical human condition - 
<br>
reproduction. I mean, a condom (like a contact lense) is just a tool. The 
<br>
pill seems like a lot more than that. Then again, perhaps a similar argument 
<br>
could be made about vaccination.
<br>
<p>(BTW I have never felt like either a cyborg or a transhuman for the duration 
<br>
of wearing a condom, but then again I've never felt like one at all... 
<br>
merely your common or garden transhuman*ist*, I'm afraid.)
