Though I'm in theory &quot;on reflective vacation&quot; from the list,
<br>
I thought this piece of information would be useful.
<br>
<p>There is tonight a &quot;town meeting&quot; television production
<br>
occurring in Seattle (or perhaps a previously recorded show being
<br>
rebroadcast) including significant individuals such as the
<br>
Governor of Washington, the Mayor, police &amp; fire chiefs of
<br>
Seattle, etc.
<br>
<p>In the audience of this meeting is Representative Jim McDermott (D),
<br>
of Seattle, one of the few MDs (i.e. highly educated) in the House of
<br>
Representatives of the Congress.  Now, I'm not a &quot;huge&quot; fan of McDermott,
<br>
since I view his positions as tending to be somewhat equivocal -- but I
<br>
am always willing to have my opinions revised given reasons for doing so.
<br>
<p>It was *very* interesting to note that during the discussion
<br>
he did specifically draw attention to the use of President Bush's
<br>
use of the term &quot;crusade&quot; and the fact that this was precisely
<br>
the terms used by bin Laden to justify and promote opposition
<br>
against the West.
<br>
<p>So, all of our politicians are not completely ill-informed with regard
<br>
to the details of the discussions, nor do they seem to be ill-equipped
<br>
to appreciate the significance of such subtle details.
<br>
<p>Whether their voices will be heard above the noise of the drumbeat
<br>
remains to be seen.
<br>
<p>Robert
