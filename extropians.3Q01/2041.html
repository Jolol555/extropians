I've received virtually the exact SAME report from other 'friends' on
<br>
the internet, so either your friend or my friends are plagiarizing off
<br>
of each other (or both are doing it off of another source).
<br>
Friends will pass these messages along to others to 'spread the word'.
<br>
<p>Having attended some of these sorts of protests in the past, I can tell
<br>
you that the organizers specifically hand out &quot;talking points&quot; text for
<br>
people to send out in their own form to as many people as possible in
<br>
emails, which contains information which is totally false (especially as
<br>
they hand this info out BEFORE police brutality happens). These
<br>
'brutality' incidents are incited by the protest organizers, as I
<br>
already described, as much as the entire riot is completely orchestrated
<br>
by them for propaganda purposes.

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Leonardo,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is the standard sort of manufactured propaganda message these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; groups post, fabricating much and exaggerating even more, writing in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; semantically inflammatory way. I've attended protests here in the US by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these groups and seen these posts afterward, claiming all sorts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; police atrocities that never happened. In instances where police got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; physical, it was only after some of the most vicious and violent baiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have ever seen done. What would you do if you had 1000 people yelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and screaming in your face, calling you all sorts of things, insulting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everything about you and your family and your profession, spitting and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; throwing rotten food at you from a few feet away, and you had to sit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there and take it for hours on end???? Frankly, I'm disgusted with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; protesters, they deserve whatever the police throw at them, the way they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; behave.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The behavior of the protesters as I've described is INTENTIONAL, btw. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is a standard tactic taught at protest boot camps like those run by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ruckus Society and other groups. Their entire purpose is to push the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; police to the point where the police strike back in self defense and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; frustration. Once one incident occurs, they then run rumors down the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; line of women getting beaten, raped, etc etc etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Similarly, the protest organizers pass around drugs to protesters that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are mood altering: pot with high THC and low CBD levels, mushrooms and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other hallucinogens. Use of these substances is well documented to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effective as battle drugs (they were used against the British
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; successfully at a key battle against the Zulu in the 19th century,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wiping out a superior force with nothing but clubs and spears, and drug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; crazed warriors). The use of these drugs helps to raise up the battle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fever among protesters.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;  The last few days have been very intense and eye
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; opening. I am in Genova where many people from around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the world have shown up to peacefully demonstrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; against the Fascist G8. The news you will hear in the
