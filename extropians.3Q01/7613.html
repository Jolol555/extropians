<p>About 2,5 million.

<p><em>&gt;What is the population of Afghanistan?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 28 million.  That looks something like 28000 *tons* of
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, that´s the reality shock I was not prepared for. Robert, when I
<br>
suggested to get the raisin bomber fleet started I was not thinking at all
<br>
about feeding 28 million people every day for a long term. I knew it could
<br>
only have a small impact, not much more than a symbolic effect. But then:
<br>
there are 19 countries as memebers of the NATO and every nation could send
<br>
some of its aircrafts with its most famous food on board: French cheese,
<br>
Italian pasta, German bread, and so on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The right way to do this is via a truck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convoy with the obvious problem that you will need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control the roads over which the trucks travel.
</em><br>
<p>You`re probably right. It can`t be effectively done before the roads are
<br>
under control. And considering the danger of being shot by Taliban missiles,
<br>
as Damien and others have objected, it will - at least in this historically
<br>
symbolic form - remain a dream.
<br>
<p>For a minute, the raisin bomber proposal seemed to make sense, if you had
<br>
seen the German secretary of defence. He is a non-martial softie, a little
<br>
short sighted, stumbles oer his own feet most of times but - best of all -
<br>
he is madly in love with his new woman, so serotonine, endorphines and other
<br>
hormones with funny names all pop up at the right places in his brain. He is
<br>
so damn happy right now, you won`t believe he has anything to do with German
<br>
war business and he'd rather vote for a love peace and happiness ralley in
<br>
Afghanistan than helping to kill a single Taliban.
<br>
<p>You may say I`m a dreamer. But, imagine ... there is a war and all innocent
<br>
civilians will be fed.
