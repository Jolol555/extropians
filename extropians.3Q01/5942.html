That will be illegal. After all, why would you want to do that, other
<br>
than to run illegal piracy tools?

<p>(I urge everyone on this list to subscribe to Declan McCullough's
<br>
moderated politech mailing list. It's really useful for heads-up warnings
<br>
on issues like this, and explores the consequences of such laws with
<br>
unflinching dedication.)
<br>
<p>The SSSCA bill is sponsored by a senator Hollings.  Turns out he's
<br>
had a lot of money from the TV, Movies, and Music industries via PAC
<br>
donations.  One side-effect of SSSCA is that to comply, the hardware
<br>
vendors can simply start shipping PC's with CPRM-compliant IDE drives
<br>
and Trust Computing Platfrom Alliance's TCPA spec motherboards. These
<br>
can be rigged to only execute boot loaders that are digitally signed
<br>
to load and run a kernel which is in turn digitally signed as &quot;secure&quot;
<br>
-- think in terms of a web of trust inside your computer, belonging to
<br>
someone else, verifying that everything down to the device drivers is
<br>
signed as secure by the vendors. Writing an unsigned or unsecure driver
<br>
would of course be a violation of the SSSCA and a criminal offense.
<br>
<p>Given that Microsoft are trying to get into the home entertainment centre
<br>
market with HomeStation (aka XBox2), my guess is that in addition to
<br>
being a copyright fascists' law, it is also Microsoft's exit strategy
<br>
from the conventional software biz -- become the main distribution
<br>
channel for audio/video/e-books, and protect their monopoly by teaming
<br>
up with the film and music industries to create a legislated lock-out
<br>
on the competition.
