As some of you are aware, one of the reasons I decided
<br>
to leave Aeiveos Sciences Group in 1997 was because of
<br>
the analysis we did that indicated that the forthcoming
<br>
use of gene-chip technologies would make the research
<br>
we were doing at the time 10-100 times cheaper in the not
<br>
so distant future (as the comedians say, timing is everything).
<br>
<p>The first paper using the chips came out in late 1999
<br>
but my conversations with Rich Weindruch (one of the
<br>
authors) indicated that at that time they were still
<br>
pretty expensive to use for day-to-day research.
<br>
<p>I ran across this paper today:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The effects of aging on gene expression in the hypothalamus
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cortex of mice&quot;, Jiang CH, Tsien JZ, Schultz PG, Hu Y
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PNAS 98(4):1930-4 (13 Feb 2001).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11172053&dopt=Abstract">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11172053&dopt=Abstract</a>
<br>
<p>What I find interesting about it is the comment regarding
<br>
the upregulation of many proteases.  What could be causing
<br>
this is the fact that lipofuscin accululates with age,
<br>
particularly in the brain.  So lets assume we have a
<br>
gradual accumulation of &quot;nondigestable&quot; material and the
<br>
way the gene regulation network responds to that is to
<br>
increase the activity of the cellular protein degradation
<br>
apparatus.  But lets say the degradation is moderately
<br>
non-specific and starts degrading the good proteins
<br>
along with the bad proteins.  The net result is that
<br>
your brain becomes &quot;starved&quot; for proteins it needs for
<br>
maintenance, e.g. glucose transporters &amp; mitochondrial
<br>
proteins as well proteins necessary for normal function,
<br>
e.g. neurotransmitter manufacturing enzymes.  Now, what
<br>
is good is that this potentially means there are interventions
<br>
that could help such as protease inhibitor drugs as well as drugs
<br>
that influence regulatory signals to increase overall protein
<br>
production.
<br>
<p>Also worth noting, is the use of &quot;high density oligonucleotide
<br>
arrays&quot;, the fact that the paper had only 4 authors and
<br>
the work is being funded by Novartis, pretty much matching
<br>
my expectations from several years ago.
<br>
<p>Prediction: over the next 5 years you will see this type
<br>
of information turn into a flood.
<br>
<p>Also of Note:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do 'smart' mice feel more pain, or are they just better learners?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang, Y., Shimizu, E, Tsien, JZ.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature Neuroscience 4(5):453-4 (May 2001).

<p>I don't have a access to this article, but Anders or someone
<br>
with University access might want to clue us in its general contents.
