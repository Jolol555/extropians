<em>&gt; If we cannot learn how to be objective and calm with
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Actually I have no problem explaining and expounding on Transhumanists ideas
<br>
with people I meet on a day to day basis, however expereinec has taught me
<br>
not to mention this list, as the nature of much of the political discussion
<br>
on here would be abhorent to most of my friends and colleagues. It has to
<br>
remain my own dirty little secret. I would suggest that this list is more
<br>
likely to push left leaning freethinkers into luddism than make any
<br>
recruits.
