When I read this, I realised that I also had thought of the same idea, or idea similiar in nature.
<br>
<p>In the Theory of Sociologistics, of about a year ago, I published the concept of our Universe as Computer Simulation and provided an example of how we can use computer program to explain the perculiar quantum behaviour of the universe, as applied to the Light Travelling Through the Double Trapdoor Experiment.
<br>
<p><p>I recognised that this thinking has great implications, but I did not know that someone else had also took the idea seriously enough.
<br>
<p>As one who does a lot of computer programming, I realised about one or two years ago that we may exist in a computer simulation and thus our models of the universe might fit better if we use programs instead of abstract mathematics (of which quite a bit of which I have difficulty following).
<br>
<p><p>Well, at least I have something else to look forward to: the Human Computer Interface System (HCIS) Project, which aims to do something like what Mathematica did, but to the entire scope of a language. It promises to outdo the rather pathetic HCIS specifications (called Yunilen) on my paper of a nature very immature and different from what I now have in mind. Darn, if I only have a few more years of free time to work on it, and then a few more years developing more fundamentals of the Theory of Sociologistics.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, some societies seem to value a few years of compulsory military service more than a few years of scientific research, and until I can build a better society (the goal intended by Project Sociologistics), I will just have to go along with them. If any of you have any comments or advice, please do not hesitate to post them or send them to me.
