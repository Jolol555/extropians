<p>New chip to revolutionize our future
<br>
By Rupert Goodwins, ZDNet News
<br>
<p><a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/zd/20010705/tc/new_chip_to_revolutionize_our_future_1.html">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/zd/20010705/tc/new_chip_to_revolutionize_our_future_1.html</a>
<br>
<p>ZDNet UK's Rupert Goodwins says our world and ourselves - will exist 
<br>
online, in a way that makes today's Internet seem like a pale shadow. 
<br>
The privacy implications are enormous.
<br>
<p>In 1896, Henri Antoine Becquerel discovered that small flecks of 
<br>
uranium could fog photographic plates. Around ten years later, 
<br>
Einstein wrote his Special Theory of Relativity and demonstrated that 
<br>
mass and energy were equivalent: E=MCsquared. Forty years on, 
<br>
Oppenheimer showed what happens when you mix the two ideas.
<br>
<p>I'm looking at a publicity shot of Mew, a new chip from Hitachi. It's 
<br>
a tiny speck of silicon less than half a millimetre on each side, and 
<br>
it doesn't do much except squirt a serial number into the ether on 
<br>
request. Yet combine it with the Internet and it has the potential to 
<br>
change society just as radically as Einstein's mass-energy 
<br>
equivalence, because Mew can make information and objects one and the 
<br>
same.
<br>
<p>Let's step back a bit. For all that the world of the Internet relates 
<br>
to the real world we live in, it's not the same. If you send an email 
<br>
to a pal you won't know where he is when he gets it, and a picture on 
<br>
eBay is no guarantee that Earle in Wyoming actually has a stuffed 
<br>
wombat for sale. Information slips around the world as freely and as 
<br>
untraceably as water, and from this freedom come the joys and the 
<br>
sins of the Net.
<br>
<p>But tie physical objects into the system, and things look a lot 
<br>
different. Hitachi says that one of the big uses of the Mew chip will 
<br>
be to prevent counterfeit currency and other high-value, very 
<br>
portable items. The chip is so small and lightweight it can be 
<br>
inserted into a banknote and be detectable at a distance of around 
<br>
thirty centimetres.
<br>
<p>Let's imagine that this happens, ostensibly for checking the ID of 
<br>
notes in banks and shops. This is wireless, though, so you can do it 
<br>
anywhere at any time without the owner knowing. Once there are public 
<br>
sensors, each note--and each car, wallet, set of glasses, book, 
<br>
whatever--that passes within range will be known to the system, both 
<br>
position and identity.
<br>
<p>The world will be such a different place when this technology is 
<br>
fully developed that it's hard to imagine what it will be like to 
<br>
live there. How could you steal something if the owner just needs to 
<br>
ask his computer and it will be found? How can you fake something if 
<br>
you can't give it the same ID as something else--a duplication will 
<br>
sound alarm bells--or a different ID to everything else? There'll be 
<br>
central registries, and if an ID isn't legit then the system will 
<br>
know. People will hack the system, sure, but once detected it'll be 
<br>
desperately simple to find the offenders and stop the problem.
<br>
<p>So our world--and ourselves--will exist online, in a way that makes 
<br>
today's Internet seem like a pale shadow. Our current worries about 
<br>
privacy will pall compared to what might happen if not only ourselves 
<br>
but every item we own is just another node on the network.
<br>
<p>Is there any reason to think this will come about? Very much so. 
<br>
We've been prepared to countenance security cameras that recognise 
<br>
our faces when we walk down Newham High Street, and cameras that 
<br>
report back to HQ when we drive our cars up the M1. The advantages to 
<br>
the state, and to us, of having God-like powers of omniscience are 
<br>
far too tempting to pass up. Little things like income tax could go 
<br>
away, when every transaction of money or goods can be monitored and a 
<br>
rate of tax calculated--and the money taken--that's appropriate for 
<br>
who's selling, who's buying and what's being bought. Why go to the 
<br>
hassle of a yearly return, or having separate sorts of taxation when 
<br>
you can just have a single transaction tax that's automatic?
<br>
<p>There's plenty of new technology needed before we get there, but none 
<br>
of it is unthinkable. We'll need ubiquitous radio networks, but we're 
<br>
building those. We'll need tiny, flexible power supplies: these, too, 
<br>
are on their way. We'll need a way to identify billions of unique 
<br>
objects and use that information to build up databases of what, where 
<br>
and when--just the sort of idea that the Internet's been playing with.
<br>
<p>Most of all, we need to think about what this new world will be like, 
<br>
and what rules we want in place to cope with the radically different 
<br>
ideas of personal and state power it implies. The old contract 
<br>
between the subject and the state will be as inadequate to the task 
<br>
as the old copyright laws are at coping with peer-to-peer music 
<br>
sharing. The Internet itself will just be the driest of dry runs for 
<br>
the big bang to come.
<br>
<p>World changing technology in a grain of metal--and we have no more 
<br>
idea of where we'll be in fifty years time than Becquerel could 
<br>
foresee Hiroshima. Welcome to the future.
