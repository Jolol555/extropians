<p><em>&gt;[John K Clark wrote]

<p><em>&gt;&gt; Extropians hold some controversial views and are not shy about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; talking about them, so if we thought the white &quot;race&quot;... was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; superior to other humans we would say so in a loud clear voice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The reason you have not heard us say such a thing is that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; don't think it's true.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Will the Extropian application of scientific method tell you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if it is true or not?  How?
</em><br>
<p>I can hardly speak for all Extropians of course, but here is how
<br>
I would try.  The unqualified term &quot;superior to&quot; has to be taken
<br>
as meaning &quot;superior to in all important ways&quot;, in the context
<br>
above, e.g., we may say that human beings are superior to monkeys.
<br>
(It's not coincidental, by the way, that monkeys and human beings
<br>
are different species.)
<br>
<p>Now the reason that nothing as large as a human racial group can be
<br>
&quot;superior to other human racial groups in all important ways&quot; is
<br>
that there has not been enough time, evolutionarily speaking, for
<br>
such large differences to develop.
<br>
<p>A second reason is that all tests, whether of intelligence, running
<br>
speed, swimming ability, emotional stability, etc., show a tremendous
<br>
overlap.  That is, each of these abilities is approximately normally
<br>
distributed, and the means and standard deviations of all human
<br>
racial groups are close.  But if you were to compare, for example,
<br>
throwing ability, you would learn that the difference between humans
<br>
and chimpanzees is vastly, vastly larger.  No normal human being (that
<br>
is, one not obviously suffering from an unusual impairment) will throw
<br>
worse than the most skilled chimpanzee.  But there has been no trait
<br>
that I know of---much less an important one---where there is anything
<br>
like this kind of difference between human races.
