<em>&gt; People flying in with olive branches in their mouth?  It is

</em><br>
<p>My investment here was to describe how one could use flammable
<br>
source material to attain the level of objectivity where one
<br>
could actually &quot;give aid and comfort&quot; to one's partisan adversaries.  
<br>
It's possible that you still view such efforts as sophistry of one
<br>
sort or another.  It's possible that you will not simply not be
<br>
able to understand what I was doing.  In this case, my challenge
<br>
was to (American) liberals to find something---anything---highly
<br>
damaging to their own beliefs in some screed somewhere---anywhere.
<br>
I provided yet another copy of that essay (as well as a pointer
<br>
to an essay about black crime) still hoping that some would take
<br>
me up on it.
<br>
<p>On a more hopeful note, Josh wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wanted Gore to win. I wanted recounts.  I thought I wanted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recounts because that seemed the fairest way to resolve such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a close count. But maybe the fact that I wanted Gore to win was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a much more important factor in determining my position on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recounts.
</em><br>
<p>Isn't that admirable?  (Despite the &quot;maybe&quot;s.)  That's actually
<br>
as close as a liberal has come to my now quite passe challenge.
<br>
But so bad---I submit---are many people's understanding of what
<br>
I was trying to do, that this very two paragraphs will be definitely
<br>
interpreted some of the 900 people reading this list  as politically
<br>
self-serving.  Therefore, I must add:
<br>
<p>Lee Corbin:
<br>
I admit that I maintained that there should be no recounts primarily
<br>
because I wanted Bush to win.
<br>
