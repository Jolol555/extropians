<br>
<p>### IMHO, this is a very wrong attitude. Preventative restriction of
<br>
freedom, applied to any sane humans over age 5, can only be applied on an
<br>
individual basis against persons who proved their willingness to behave
<br>
destructively. Otherwise, you have to give children (and underdeveloped
<br>
societes) some freedom to let them err, and learn from it, otherwise you
<br>
will never see them become responsible adults. 
<br>
<p>Supporting authoritarianism against democracy to prevent adults from doing
<br>
what they want is wrong on a basic moral level. Every innocent adult (in
<br>
this context, a person who has not killed another innocent person, or
<br>
substantially contributed to such an act) has the right to do what he/she
<br>
wants, as long as they don't harm others. Only once they cross that line do
<br>
they become a subject to justice. Same applies to groups of adult humans. 
<br>
<p>What you say is that 800 million people are so twisted, stupid and
<br>
degenerate that the only government they deserve is a dictatorship. The
<br>
truth is exactly the opposite: tyrannies warp humans, deprive them of access
<br>
to knowledge, hurt them and then try to manipulate their resulting hatred to
<br>
control them. It can take years of social development in a budding democracy
<br>
to cast off the darkness that accumulates on human minds in the dungeon. 
<br>
<p>If a democratic country makes a mistake, by a majority vote (like in
<br>
allowing terrorist training camps on their soil), they can and should be
<br>
punished for it (after the fact, not preventatively, by somebody claiming to
<br>
&quot;know better&quot;, or even be just plainly superior to the poor brutes in the
<br>
street). Such punishment, whether defeat in a war, or a reduced bond rating,
<br>
teaches all voters to choose better next time. A dictatorship gives no
<br>
choice, and no way of learning from mistakes. If Arabs are deprived of the
<br>
learning that comes with democracy, they will forever blame others for all
<br>
their problems, and be a major destabilizing force. Imagine what would have
<br>
happened if the US imposed a dictatorship on Germany after the war? Do you
<br>
think they would be US allies? No, they would hate your guts, and with good
<br>
reason.
<br>
<p>Democracy (although imo not the best possible method of governing) is always
<br>
in the long run superior to dictatorship. The US should never become
<br>
associated with tyrannies (such as the Pahlavi regime), or else the blood of
<br>
every victim of their secret police (like the Savak in Iran) will be on your
<br>
(US voter) hands, too.
