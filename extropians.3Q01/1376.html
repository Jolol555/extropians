<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;You DO NOT have the right to take other peoples property (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;have the government take it for you). You must rely on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;voluntary contributions and charity if you want to be moral.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; However do you get around? It must be rather limiting, restricting your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; routes to avoid any roads paid for by taxes. Or do you drive along (or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;sit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; in the bus or train) in a state of crushing and unremitting guilt?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Guilt??  He's talking about the politicians and the voters
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;who took the money.  Annoyance, or perhaps the feeling of
</em><br>
?&gt;being abused, is probably what he feels when using the roads.

<em>&gt;Nozick has an interesting essay on this somewhere in his _Philosophical

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Personally, I don't make a good libertarian because I can see no principled
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;way to restrict government activities in the field of building social 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infrastructure like roads, public schools, etc, and collecting taxes to pay
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;for it. This is not an argument for big government, which can be opposed on
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;various bases, just a view that there is no knock-out argument in favour of
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;minarchy. I think it can be shown that any pure minarchist position such as
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Jerry Mitchell seems to be advocating collapses into either anarchism or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;classical liberalism, once a serious attempt is made to defend it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I do think there is something damn close to a knock-out argument against 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;passing laws based on the reasoning that &quot;we don't want you to exercise
</em><br>
your 
<br>
<em>&gt;freedom in certain ways that we find immoral&quot;. That, however, is a
</em><br>
classical 
<br>
<em>&gt;liberal view, not strictly a libertarian one.

<p>1: It does annoy me to be driving around on roads that I know for a fact can
<br>
be built and maintained by private methods.
<br>
2: I dont have the perfect blueprint for Utopia, but I can tell you one
<br>
thing, that it wouldnt be funded via taxation(theft). The only honest
<br>
purpose of government in my opinion is the police, judicial system, and the
<br>
military. All these things could be funded through voluntary methods
<br>
(Lotteries, contract protection payments, etc.... use your imagination)
<br>
<p>I would have hoped that a discussion list as open minded and as clever as
<br>
this, could not only imagine a moral government as such, but would probably
<br>
be able to go that next step beyond where I am and actually design some of
<br>
the workings of it. How many people here, when trying to convey topics that
<br>
we deal with (A.I, nanotech, etc.) hear &quot;Thats impossible or&quot; &quot;Its WAY off
<br>
in the future beyond where we will be able to see it&quot;? Stretch a bit here,
<br>
dont give up on a moral government because you dont think its possible, find
<br>
a way to make it work! Close the holes in any gaps someone points out and
<br>
thank them for helping. Look at the frameworks already put together for
<br>
designing A.I., they may not be exact specific intstructions on what code to
<br>
enter, but its a start. Doesnt everyone agree that theft (taking property
<br>
without permission) is wrong in principle? What about the idea that it is
<br>
wrong to initiate force or fraud?
<br>
<p>The biggest hurdle I cant get past personally is this majority rule thing.
<br>
Why does 51% of the population get to hold the magic excalibur and wield
<br>
total control over the other 49%? What principle allows this and what
<br>
supports it? No, I dont have the alternative, but me not haveing the answer
<br>
doesnt mean that this is the best we can do... I never said I was a genius,
<br>
but it doesnt take a 200 IQ to grasp basic principles and know when your not
<br>
following them. Rather then trying to answer back to this with the usual
<br>
screaching of being practicial, try to think of a way to make the principled
<br>
approah the only practical solution, then you will have done more for
<br>
freedom then any government program could have ever done.
