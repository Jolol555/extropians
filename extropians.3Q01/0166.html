</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; not allow one person to benefit at the harm or death of thousands or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions of others. Our current system lives inside completely fallicious
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet, and even shortly after we leave the planet, resoures may indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become limiting factor for growth.) The world cannot endure unlimited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damage, or pollution. The world cannot sustain unlimited human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; populations. Yet, the basis of our economics assume these very things.
</em><br>
<p>No, it is not, nor are resources limited. Yes there is a fixed quantity
<br>
on earth, which we have barely scratched the surface of. However, there
<br>
is far more to resource utilization than sheer mass. Efficiency is one
<br>
thing. If technological advances in utilization efficiency, refining
<br>
efficiency, recycling, etc exceed any increase in demand, then the
<br>
actual total mass utilized goes down (for example, 97% of all aluminum
<br>
used is recycled, which has contributed to the decline of the bauxite
<br>
refining industry). Similarly, if we are able to recover more of a
<br>
resource for less cost due to better technology, then the saved money
<br>
equals saved resources in and of itself.
<br>
<p>The facts are that a) we, as industrialized individuals, pollute far
<br>
less than we used to, b) even with externalities included, resource
<br>
costs per capita have continuously trended downward, and c) if they were
<br>
getting more scarce, they would be trending upward. Per capita pollution
<br>
follows a bell curve that peaks at around $10,000 of annual per capita
<br>
income. When an economy advances beyond this point, per capita pollution
<br>
begins to drop off markedly, to the point that at around $20,000-25,000,
<br>
the average person doesn't pollute much more than they would have in a
<br>
stone age existence.
