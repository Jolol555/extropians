<p>I'm not surprised. With its feudalistic and socialistic heritage, self
<br>
ownership itself is not considered to be more important than the
<br>
'rights' of society as a whole in europe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I see it, integrity is the ability to determine for oneself what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information to let in and out from oneself and to determine what one does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with it. I show integrity when I decide for myself whether to be swayed or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not by the opinions of others rather than just accept or allow myself to be
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; revealing my thoughts or medical information, or demand ownership of such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information forcing e.g. a doctor not to reveal it to a third party.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This seems to fit in quite well with the idea of having an inviolable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information sphere at some distance from the self, although it is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious *where* it should lie - is it just my self-owned body and its

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved too. Ouch).
</em><br>
<p>Integrity here is considered to represent your honesty/trustworthiness,
<br>
though I see what you mean, however this 'integrity' concept you put
<br>
forth is simply referring to the integrity of one's privacy. Since your
<br>
integrity is a matter of your expression and behavior, it is also innate
<br>
as your freedom of choice and personal ownership. Changing terms doesn't
<br>
change the phenomenon. It's still about privacy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nick Szabo's talk touched on this, suggesting that for uploads privacy ==
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom; I would say that at least for infomorphs integrity == freedom.
</em><br>
<p>Integrity is a characteristic of a right. You can have integrity about
<br>
many different things, it only refers to essentially the strength and
<br>
permeability of some thing.
