<p>Have you ever wondered how much of this view, your own view, is also a
<br>
cultural myth? After all, it is also reinforced by a large group of
<br>
people who have a vested interest in appearing to be supporting the
<br>
underdog against the Powers That Be and are well represented in the
<br>
media. The idea that it is just a matter of elites versus each other and
<br>
the oppressed/misled masses is after all a very comforting one, since it
<br>
provides a big narrative where experiences can be neatly categorized and
<br>
an ethical polarity placing the viewer on a higher ground than the
<br>
otherwise ascendant elites - in short, if you start believing in it, it
<br>
will be self reinforcing too.
