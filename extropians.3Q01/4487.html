<p><em>&gt;&gt;From this, I assume that the reason that science is difficult is

</em><br>
<p>Maybe I was using too-shorthand in saying `Piagetian'. What Cromer and some
<br>
other educational analysts have done with the widely accepted work of Swiss
<br>
psychologist Jean Piaget is to look at the typical *mental tool kits* (so
<br>
to speak) used by ordinary people, and relate these to a
<br>
conjectured/observed series of stages of development available to the human
<br>
mind as it encounters the world while growing up. Many people, according to
<br>
this analysis, remain stuck in the `preoperational' and `concrete
<br>
operational' stages, never managing the leap to `formal operational'
<br>
abstract thinking. Children at earlier levels notoriously find it hard to
<br>
understand conservation rules: pour a beverage from a tall thin container
<br>
into a wide flat one and they'll wail that they've been shortchanged; they
<br>
can't grasp that the same amount of `stuff' is still there--it's obviously
<br>
*less*, since *lower*. And so on. Cromer claims that 50% of Americans never
<br>
make it to formal operations (usually associated with the transition
<br>
through adolescence), which is requisite for hypothetico-deductive
<br>
reasoning. Arguably a lot of common sense constructs are established prior
<br>
to formal operational analysis.
