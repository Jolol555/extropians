<em>&gt; This has not been my experience at all.  I find most people strongly dislike

<em>&gt; That's the whole point behind equal rights, to treat different groups the

</em><br>
<p>I find that people will prefer to be treated different if that different
<br>
treatment is an improvement over how everybody else is treated. Seniors
<br>
will emphasize how old they are if there is a discount offered, while at
<br>
any other time they don't want to talk about how old they are. Women
<br>
don't want their sex or appearance to be a factor unless they happen to
<br>
know that it will give them an edge (government set-aside contracts, for
<br>
instance, or emphasizing one's cleavage to a male boss). Even elites are
<br>
not above this. A certain rock n' roll star I know always tells people
<br>
he does business with that 'he just wants to be treated like a regular
<br>
guy', except of course on those few occasions when he is trying to work
<br>
a deal to his advantage, he whips out the old star treatment for whoever
<br>
it is.
