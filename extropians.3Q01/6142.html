Mike, I agree with you.
<br>
<p>BUT IMHO
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Intelligence people say that they knew that bin laden was training
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pilots to suicide crash airliners with simulators.
</em><br>
<p>Should have in itself set off alarms and in-the-field intelligence operations. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Keep in mind that using airliners as lawn darts has NEVER been used as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorist tactic (unless you count that Egyptair crash a few years ago).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The worst we would expect was hijacking followed by hostage taking and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;negotiation.
</em><br>
<p>Then things have changed a lot in the last years. There were scenarios and
<br>
contingency plans in place that covered &quot;impossible&quot; situations. This was
<br>
far from impossible. Has the US government and DOD given up war gaming
<br>
entirely for security planning? It is not like the WTC has not been attacked
<br>
before and is a know potential terrorist target.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When your airline is responsible for its own security, and farms that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out to minimum wage rentacops, that is a recipe for disaster.
</em><br>
True, one of the WEB sources posted mentioned airport security was more to
<br>
give an impression of safety rather than safety itself. 
<br>
<p>Well if the government response to this is similar to their response to the
<br>
Los Angeles Northridge earthquake wait till the FEMA guys get to NYC. Then
<br>
you really know what it is like to suffer. The damage and chaos done by FEMA
<br>
was far  more damaging than the earthquake.
<br>
