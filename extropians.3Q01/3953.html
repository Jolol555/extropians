This is to followup on the messages now that I've read
<br>
them all.
<br>
<p>You've got perhaps several problems:
<br>
a) Antibiotic use in humans who only have viral infections
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prescribed by doctors who don't want to do the necessary
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tests (which cost $) or patients who strongly request
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the physician &quot;do something&quot;.
<br>
b) Improper antibiotic use by humans.  If the patients feel
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;better they stop taking the prescription.  This produces
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the increases the abundance of antibiotic resistant
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bacteria as Harvey discussed.
<br>
c) Overuse of antibiotics in food animals (because the farmers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want to feed the critters and not the critters' critters).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the bacteria that develop resistance to them are dumped
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the environment (through feces) where they can share those
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genes with their cousins (via the bacterial viruses).
<br>
d) Natural selection environments such as hospitals where
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is a big emphasis on getting rid of all of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bacteria.  So you get a lot of use of antibiotics and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bacteriocides.  Eventually anything that survives will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be something that has mutated its way around the killing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;field.
<br>
<p>Its got nothing to do with GAIA fighting back.  Its got to
<br>
do with the bacteria being at war with each other and us
<br>
providing environments that promote the survival of individuals
<br>
who would otherwise be out-competed due to the extra expense
<br>
of having to manufacture defensive systems that would be
<br>
useless in other environments.
