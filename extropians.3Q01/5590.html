Now, I'm annoyed.  No, I'm more than annoyed.
<br>
I'm angry.  Actually, in fact, I'm more than angry.
<br>
I'm really incredibly f**king pissed off.
<br>
<p>This is the *EXTROPIANS* mailing list.  The purpose of this list
<br>
is to promote the increase of valid memes, ideas, discussions, etc.
<br>
that *decrease* the amount of noise in the universe.  It *isn't*
<br>
about individuals pushing their individual opinions and polluting
<br>
the meme space.

<p>J. R. Molloy recently wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If there is a problem, it's concentrated more in government (the PC ruling

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This is nothing but political BULLSHIT.  If J.R. had bothered to investigate
<br>
this even a little (1 google search), he would find that the President has
<br>
a salary of $400K (<a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/govdocs/fedprssal.html">http://www.lib.umich.edu/govdocs/fedprssal.html</a>) annually.
<br>
<p>So claiming that the &quot;US president, who is paid millions&quot; is either a lack
<br>
of knowledge (DON'T CLAIM FACTS FOR WHICH YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE), or
<br>
an attempt to support an argument (about the overpaid &quot;PC ruling class&quot;)
<br>
on the basis of incorrect claims (which is an extreme disservice to the list).
<br>
<p>On the whole, government salaries are very low compared to industry
<br>
positions of equivalent difficulty.  That is why replacing directors for
<br>
such agencies as NASA or NIH tends to be problematic (the salaries do
<br>
not justify the headaches).
<br>
<p>CLAIM: &quot;most overpaid bosses are in goverment&quot;
<br>
Citation Please!
<br>
<p>CLAIM: &quot;the president... is responsible for no identifiable product&quot;
<br>
<p>One only need look at the valuation knocked off the public stock markets
<br>
last week (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=^DJI&d=2b">http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=^DJI&d=2b</a>; DJIA: 10,400 -&gt; 9950)
<br>
to realize that the President plays a critical role in the perceptions of
<br>
and actions taken by consumers and investors.  What happened?  The President
<br>
changed from the typical &quot;presidential-role&quot;, e.g. &quot;the economy is fine&quot;, in
<br>
an attempt to appear more sensitive politically than his father, to: &quot;there
<br>
are people being affected by current economic conditions&quot;.  Result -- billions
<br>
of dollars of investment capital down the tubes.
<br>
<p>Two &quot;identifiable product(s)&quot; with which the President is associated are the
<br>
design and execution of a U.S. foreign policy and the health of the
<br>
U.S. economy (in the absence of involvement in conflicts, in which
<br>
case he plays the role of the commander-in-chief).  Now, I view the presidents
<br>
as being in boxes not of their creation so the job sucks from the outset.  How
<br>
many people on the list would want a job negotiating between the Arabs and the
<br>
Isrealis for $400K/yr?  Do you want the deaths of American citizens sent
<br>
off to fight in foreign conflicts on your conscience?  Or would you prefer
<br>
the weight of those deaths that could result from your policies of
<br>
non-intervention?  Do you want the headaches of having to negotiate with
<br>
several hundred individuals whose agendas are quite different from your own,
<br>
many of whom really *want* your job?
<br>
<p>Its no small wonder that we end up with &quot;C&quot; students for presidents.
<br>
Anyone smarter is bright enough to avoid the job.
<br>
<p>People should get their facts straight and avoid excessive editorial
<br>
extrapolations with little basis (if you catch me doing it, you may
<br>
feel free to call me on it).
<br>
<p>JUST THE FACTS FOLKS, JUST THE FACTS.  Identify the speculations as such
<br>
otherwise I'll make it my mission position your mind just above the
<br>
event horizon of a black hole, where you are slowly corrupted by
<br>
Hawking radiation even as the matter composing said mind gets slowly
<br>
sucked down into the singularity.
<br>
<p>This isn't a game -- this is reality (maybe).
