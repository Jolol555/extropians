<p>&lt;I can't remember who on this list pointed out that the common open-source

model for development is not suitable for all endeavours&gt;
<br>
<p>I'd be interesting in taking a look at that post, but as yet I haven't found
<br>
it in the archives (I wasn't subscribed to the list when it was posted).
<br>
Could the person who discussed the application of the open-source model to
<br>
projects other than software development please let me know so that I can
<br>
search the archives by author and locate the post?
<br>
<p>Thanks
<br>
<p><p>To continue with what Miriam wrote:
<br>
<p>&lt;and I think I
<br>
agree with them.&gt;
<br>
<p>I do too (at least as far as I can agree without having read the post :-).
<br>
<p>I like the idea of picking and using the best aspects of capitalism (it
<br>
would be interesting to take an inventory of the characteristics of
<br>
capitalism. I have to confess, I'm not sure what people mean when they use
<br>
the term. Different people seem to mean different things at different times)
<br>
and open source.
<br>
<p>&lt;The main problem remaining is social justice: how to ensure that a child
<br>
born to parents who didn't want and couldn't afford children would not be
<br>
condemned to second-class citizenry for their parents' mistake, or that a
<br>
genius with a genetic disease would not be cast out of the medical system
<br>
as uninsurable. This wastes very important resources.&gt;
<br>
<p>Not only does it waste resources, it's also not the sort of situation I'd
<br>
want to live in, since I have no way of knowing for sure that I, or someone
<br>
I love, won't need help someday. As Samantha Atkins has mentioned in a
<br>
recent post, advanced technology is likely to provide a wider range of
<br>
options than we've been used to in the past. I still favor the unqualified
<br>
guaranteed minimum income as the option that would involve the least
<br>
regulation of human behavior (by unqualified, I mean that everyone gets it,
<br>
regardless of income level, health, etc.) Along with this, I'd like to see
<br>
the status of children change drastically. At the moment, all children are
<br>
treated more as sub-humans than second class citizens. Giving human rights
<br>
to children would be likely to at least partially solve the problem of
<br>
parents having children for the main purpose of collecting more gov't
<br>
benefits. Human rights would include the right to own property, the right to
<br>
control one's own body, the right to &quot;divorce&quot; one's parents, the right to
<br>
choose one's own form of education, and the right to work and to own control
<br>
the earnings from one's work.
