</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That has not been my experience.  In theory, judging by written,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; formal policy, most religions arae this way.  In practice, whenever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people cite any religious reason for anything, it has usually boiled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; down to &quot;I believe reality should be this way, facts be damned&quot;.  Only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; demonstrations that reality is not that way - for instance, the old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; experiment with three jars of meat left outside (one sealed, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; covered by cloth, one open) to demonstrate that decaying meat does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; itself produce maggots - have proven sufficient to dislodge said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinking, and then only among those who do not insist that such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; disproofs must be some kind of unspecified trickery (whether or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they can figure out how such trickery could be accomplished) since it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; goes against their beliefs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All of that doesn't have a lot to do with religion.  It has more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do with the persistent habit of human beings to think they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can just figure it out in their heads or to trust their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuitions and random correlations too much.  Religion doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a monopoly here.
</em><br>
<p>No, but religion is one of the more commonly used excuses for such
<br>
thinking, again in my experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The actual going and devising an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment to test a supposition is a fairly recent innovation.
</em><br>
<p>In all of human history, maybe...but it's far older than I am and
<br>
therefore is not &quot;fairly recent&quot; from my perspective.  It is an upgrade
<br>
that, like email and automobiles and sanitation, has been known to and
<br>
used by the public for long enough that its novelty is no longer an
<br>
excuse not to use it where appropriate.  (But like those examples,
<br>
experimentation can suffer from technical/physical realities that
<br>
preclude its application in some circumstances.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Therefore, in practice (at least such as I have personally observed),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; religions can be safely categorized with, and dismissed along with,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinking along the lines of that which, for example, claims the moon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; landing was a hoax, or that the earth is flat, or that all living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; organisms must eventually die (see certain bacteria that have lived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; millions of years, or certain lines of human cancer cells that so far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; appear to show no signs of aging over multiple decades).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such dismissal is never ever safe because it over-generalizes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is guilty of the same sort of sloppy thinking you just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; castigated some religious people's thinking for.  Life is seldom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so simple and religion is no exception.
</em><br>
<p>It does seem like an over-generalization, but I have yet to encounter a
<br>
case where a religion did not either dissolve to general moral guides
<br>
which could be overridden by proper logic, and thus could be ignored
<br>
when convincing someone of something, or was a hard-and-fast barrier to
<br>
rational thought, along the lines of the examples listed above.
<br>
(Perhaps it is better to say that it can be categorized and dismissed
<br>
when it matters at all.  This may seem a bit harsh, but outside of a
<br>
given person, that person's beliefs only matter to the point where they
<br>
influence words and actions and other phyiscal effects on the external
<br>
world.  Thus, if a person believes in God but does not let that affect
<br>
any earthly action or utterance, the belief does not matter to the rest
<br>
of the universe.)
