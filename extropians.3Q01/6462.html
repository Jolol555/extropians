Hello everyone,
<br>
<p>Upon awakening in the early morning to go to work, my roommate told me about the terrorist attacks.  At first I thought he was sharing with me some sick joke which included a college produced hoax news tape.  Sadly, this was not the case.  
<br>
<p>I still feel in shock, and hope U.S. leaders can very carefully trod the right path in dealing with this horrible situation.  If not, American cities may down the road be vaporized with nuclear flashes of energy.  Or perhaps even more terrible, anthrax or worse will be dispersed through the air and water.  
<br>
<p>I am grateful Robert Bradbury guided the list to looking at what could be done to make the U.S. better protected.  Of course, the more we do the more it will cost.  I wonder if Americans will over the long term really be willing to pay for the necessary improvements.  
<br>
<p>I used to be a preboarding screener and can attest to the weak training, second rate equipment and low pay.  I think the job should be taken over by the government, and perhaps done by airport police.  Forget the airlines doing it... LOL
<br>
<p>I think Pres. Bush may be partially responsible for this attack happening.  Clinton tried to rein in the Israeli's in their desire to massively assassinate(often for damn good reasons!) the terrorist leadership.  But, Bush basically stayed out of Israel's way which infuriated many Arabs.  They sought to &quot;get&quot; the great ally of Israel.  I realize the middle east is a gordian knot of diplomatic headaches for which there is no easy answer.    
<br>
<p>I also REALLY wonder if the rest of the global community will stay in our corner as we struggle over the months and years to contain and crush these terrorists.  We will see...
<br>
<p>Then again, will the American people support U.S. ground forces being used to root out these terrorist elements.  I don't think only cruise missles will get the job done.  Again, we will see...

Bottom line: most natural or man-made disasters can be survived if one

prepares for them. The collapse of Western society doesn't *have* to

mean the end of cryonics and immortalism. At a fraction of the cost of
<br>
something like the Timeship, one could buy a rather large bunker complex, and use it as a high-security, impressive-yet-discreet life extension/cryonics research &amp; storage facility in &quot;peacetime&quot;, and as a self-sufficient, high-tech shelter in &quot;wartime&quot;. In other words, you'd kill (or rather: preserve) two birds with one stone. It is both financially and technically perfectly feasible -- the only things holding us back are &quot;our&quot; own prejudices, disinterest, and lack of vision. 
<br>
<p>Just ye two olde cents...

<p>The Mormon part of me which grew up being encouraged to have a two-year supply of food in preparation for personal and global calamities really does love this idea!   But, I'm not sure how truly doable it is considering the lack of funds for things as vital as whole body vitrification!
<br>
<p>I admit to loving the &quot;icon&quot; nature of the Timeship.  It would draw massive attention to the cryonics movement.  It would put us on the map.  BUT, the eyes of the global village would be upon it.  And people similar to those who destroyed the WTC might consider the Timeship an affront to the &quot;natural order&quot; of life.  And despite armed guards, steel doors, and alarms, if they really want to penetrate it, then they most likely will be successful in doing so.
<br>
<p>For this sad reason it may be a good thing to either carry on as we have with mundane looking structures, or go the next step and have  the suspended bodies stored in a silo or similar structure.
<br>
<p>The Mormon church carved out part of a mountain to create a very safe place for the family history archives.  It has entryways which would do Norad proud.  And similar topnotch living quarters and ventilation systems.  I realize we have nowhere the funds to do the same, but David Pizer would be the man to be our guide if anything could be affordably with let's say an old missle silo. 
<br>
<p>Out of national tragedy I did find some good.  I had a negative relationship with a woman I was having a hard time breaking off.  After the attacks, and the resulting human loss, I gained the necessary perspective on things.  And my own life now has been turning around for the better.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
