<p>Not sure, but you can see the seepage from orbit.

<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; We didn't have to do this when I was a kid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And back in the 'good old days', nobody knew about these things, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people just died for the same reasons that were attributed to other

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You don't give oldtimers enough credit, Mike.  When peoples start dying for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no reason, it is easy to figure out that all the dead people ate the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing before they died.  Fishing communities and clamming communities are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aware of their environment.  They know if something is wrong with the fish.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, people don't just die suddenly for no reason.  Bad mussels or bad fish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will make a lot of people sick, and it is easy to figure out that they ate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something bad.  Your theory that maybe nobody noticed this stuff before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be a good conjecture, but I don't think it holds up to investigation.
</em><br>
<p>Well, lets see some stats. If they knew if something is wrong with the
<br>
fish then, why don't they know it that easily now? Are there any stats
<br>
for blooms going back in time or not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I remember when the Androscoggin River up in northern NH was colored
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; orange and smelled to high heaven from pulping operations in Berlin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Between the mill and the hydro station downstream in Berlin, there would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be 1-3 feet of suds on top of the orange water, and when the wind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; shifted direction, those on the west side of the river received the full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brunt of the stink of the mill (which is why nobody lives on the east
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; side of the river). The mill spewed out a terrible orange/brown plume of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; smoke that could be seen from 20 miles away (and smelled from that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; distance).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Today, the mill is still in operation, but the river is no longer the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mess it once was. It is clear and smells fine. The mill still smells
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from the smell of rotting bark and the bleaching of pulp inside, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; river is now a fine place to do fly fishing, and there are no worries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about them being toxic. The mill only emits a slight plume of white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; steam, and they've stopped shipping logs down the river, everything is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by truck now. Atlantic salmon are back in migration in the watershed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; now, as their spawning streams are protected from streamside logging,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and erosion controls are used.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wonderful example, Mike.  I hate to ask, but did the Mill clean up its own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act by itself, or did the government or public have to pressure them to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so?
</em><br>
<p>It was a private lawsuit that did it. No need for government.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As for my local area here in Lebanon, I've got pictures from early in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the 20th century when there would be log jams miles long on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Connecticutt river. They would scour out the beds of the river of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; life, and wipe out bridges as well. Today, there are no such log
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; shipments, and everyone gets in a tizzy if someone's riverbank collapses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from natural erosion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All true.  But are these examples of why we shouldn't worry about pollution?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or are these examples of how bad it was before we started worrying about it?
</em><br>
<p>These are examples of how bad it used to be, to refute claims by
<br>
yourself here and in 'common knowledge' in the public that the
<br>
environment now is worse off than before.
