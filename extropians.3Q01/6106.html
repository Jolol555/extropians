</em><br>
<em>&gt; favor of shared interests and expertise. Contacts that often use pen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; names, and aren't necessarily compromised if appropriate information is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passed to authorities. Despite the probable desires of the intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community to have sole responsibilities for anti terrorist intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gathering in the U.S., this -- the geeks, nerds, and hackers making up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the computer community -- is a resource which should be nurtured.
</em><br>
<p><p>You want to turn hackers into spies or what?  I am sure that any
<br>
of us, in any line of work, that have leads on groups that might
<br>
be up to something like this would come forward with the
<br>
information.  But in general I don't see a tighter relationship
<br>
with authority, much of which wishes to suppress us and is used
<br>
for that purpose big-time, as being a good thing.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yesterday, we lived in a different world. A world where legislation like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the DMCA, and subsequent events including the 2600/DeCSS case, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cancellation due to threat of lawsuit of a presentation relating to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security defects in SDMI, the arrest of a Norwegian teenager linked to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DeCSS, the Skylarov arrest, and, most ominously, the proposed SSSCA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bill, was really causing a lot of anger among this community. Anger not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just against the MPAA and RIAA, but also the government. It may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very visible, since demonstrations against such things often consist of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only a couple dozen people, but the simmering resentment is there.
</em><br>
<p>It is exactly the same world as yesterday as far as these things
<br>
and the legitimate anger against them is concerned.  This
<br>
changes nothing on this front except perhaps giving
<br>
authoritarian types a bit more ammunition to control and oppress
<br>
the rest of us.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; (Consider that many in this community are too busy to take time off to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrate, and many are geeks and nerds who prefer the glow of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer screens in a darkened room to daylight). This resentment is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leading to serious discussions of which free country to emigrate to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Russia is a recent candidate, being probably furthest from the reach of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the MPAA and RIAA, with the possible exception of China). If it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continues we may well see a major brain drain from the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, Russia would certainly not be anywhere near my first
<br>
choice considering the chaos and lack of good infrasturcture and
<br>
extreme political volatility.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The discussion coming from some congressmen about re-examining civil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberties, and computer community discussion about how this day will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead to further repression of (for example) encryption technology (since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that could be used by terrorists), isn't helping. It's time to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differently. It's time to get the hackers on our side. (They always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were, in most respects anyway, and especially so in this country, where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is plenty of opportunity for talented people).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And we are happy to be on the side of freedom always.  This is
<br>
not always the US side in all political, legal and economic
<br>
conflicts however.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The choice is really fairly simple. Do we want to make every electronic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; networked device a tool of copyright law enforcement, as Hollywood and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the music industry desire and legislation like the DMCA and upcomming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SSSCA would enforce, and anger almost every hacker in the country? Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can we ease up a little, restore some rights instead of eroding them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further, (recognizing that yes, a few Hollywood films or Brittany Spears
</em><br>
<em>&gt; albums are gonna find their way onto the Internet) and turn this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community into an ally?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Cool.  I could see that.  But that isn't the way it will be
<br>
played.  Would that it were so.  It would make too much good
<br>
sense.
