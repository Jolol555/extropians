<p>I did that when I could, but kept getting caught. The Christian Brothers
<br>
liked to snap the edge of a wooden rule down on your fingers. I'm surprised
<br>
that I can enjoy a book any longer without banging my hands painfully every
<br>
15 minutes or so.

<p><em>&gt;It is strange to remember it but until the 9th grade I thought I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must be dumb.  The reason I thought that was that I couldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grasp the underlying logic or framework that made all the things
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I might have blathered on about this previously, but I was regarded as
<br>
something of a retard by the early part of secondary school. My working
<br>
class parents scrimped and saved and between having more babies sent me
<br>
from fourth grade to seventh to a medium-level moderately expensive Jesuit
<br>
school, where I didn't have a clue. That's where I was derided in front of
<br>
the whole class by an old fart for asserting that humans one day would
<br>
travel into orbit. Not to the Moon or farther, mind you; to a space
<br>
station. Everyone laughed heartily at this stupid ide, and punched me
<br>
later. It was 1954.
<br>
<p>In 1957, half a year or so before the first satellite went up (shit, who
<br>
was expecting *that*??!!), I was sacked from that school due my mental
<br>
inadequacies and sent to a technical school. I made one coat hanger out of
<br>
wood, a sheet metal dirtpan (rudely cut and soldered), and a nicely gnurled
<br>
punch.
<br>
<p>When I was 15 I escaped sideways. God awmighty.
