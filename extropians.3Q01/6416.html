<p>Two more airline passengers, the LaValley sisters, were classmates of my
<br>
father. This is really sickening me. My dreams last night were of
<br>
personal vengance, and I've increasing impatience with the disgusting
<br>
rationalizations of the bleeding hearts about moral equivalency. Went to
<br>
the gun range today and blew off several hundred rounds of 9 mm. Felt
<br>
better, but forgot to print up a picture of bin Laden to use as a
<br>
target.
<br>
<p>Peter Jennings had Hanan Mishrawi of the Arab League and the Palestinian
<br>
Authority on tv this afternoon yapping on with deflections of blame on
<br>
the jews and US, and treating her with self effacing apoligies.
<br>
<p>Arafat looked like he was gonna pee his pants, but he always acts like
<br>
someone has a gun at his back. I give 50-50 odds on him getting whacked
<br>
by his own people if he bows to any US pressure.
