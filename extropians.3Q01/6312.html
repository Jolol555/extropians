<p>Oh god, I *really* don't want to get into this, but no. From the viewpoint
<br>
of the perps it's surely more like: &quot;If she hadn't gone driving through
<br>
that part of town once a week machine-gunning the shops, schools and
<br>
churches, she wouldn't have been raped.&quot;
<br>
<p>Rape is a particularly inapropos image, of course, since the mind-infected
<br>
lunatics are driven in part, as scerir noted, by a disgustingly
<br>
misogynistic fantasy reward: the 72 compliant virgin houris they'll be
<br>
fucking in heaven for eternity.
<br>
<p>Cf: <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/june01/2001-06-26-suicide-usat.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/june01/2001-06-26-suicide-usat.htm</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In return for &quot;martyrdom,&quot; Hamas tells the youths that their families will
<br>
be financially compensated, their pictures will be posted in schools and
<br>
mosques, and they will earn a special place in heaven.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also are promised something more risqué: unlimited sex with
<br>
72 virgins in heaven. The Koran, the sacred book of Islam, describes the
<br>
women as &quot;beautiful like rubies, with complexions like diamonds and
<br>
pearls.&quot; In one of the passages of the Koran, it is said the martyrs and
<br>
virgins shall &quot;delight themselves, lying on green cushions and beautiful
<br>
carpets.&quot; Since the time of Mohammed, martyrs have always been considered
<br>
those willing to die defending Islam.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some young Muslims, that offer is too much to turn down.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know my life is poor compared to Europe or America, but I have
<br>
something awaiting me that makes all my suffering worthwhile,&quot; says Bassam
<br>
Khalifi, 16, a Hamas youth leader in Gaza's Bureij refugee camp. &quot;Most boys
<br>
can't stop thinking about the virgins.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, says Shaked, the Israeli terrorism expert, most
<br>
of the bombers don't sign up for martyrdom for the promise of unlimited
<br>
sex. &quot;They join because of their absolute devotion to God and their desire
<br>
to die with Jewish blood on their hands,&quot; he says. &quot;It's not a heroic
<br>
thing, it's a holy thing.&quot;
<br>
<p>===============
<br>
<p>And for a blow-by-blow inspection of the salient suras, etc (from a
<br>
convenient site that's nonetheless rather unpleasant in its own terms; this
<br>
character has serious problems with the idea of homosexuality):
