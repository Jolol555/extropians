<em>&gt; &gt; True (although M$ and RIAA might disagree). But it is part of the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meme complex: information must be controlled. The originating reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are of course different, but the basic problem for all the interests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; behind these systems is that if information is power, then it must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; controlled so that they (and those groups they work for, including of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; course civilian governments) can retain it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actions must be monitored and controlled.  But this does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatically mean that information must be.  Music and DVDs are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardly a munition in any stretch of imagination. :-) 
</em><br>
<p>But PGP t-shirts are munitions, and it was possible to stop the sale
<br>
of the DeCSS t-shirt. So the line between munitions/highly
<br>
controlled items and everyday stuff is seriously blurred. You are
<br>
right in that control of information isn't necessary to achieve the
<br>
desired control over action, but very many people seriously believe
<br>
it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In the end abuse has to be citizen-defined, and it needs to be defined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in such a way that the power of definition cannot be taken away from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; citizenship. How to achieve that is an important question, I really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hope we can rise to the challenge and come up with creative answers that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can be implemented.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course the question comes up of where we find these citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wise enough to define this well.  It certainly cannot be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority in a world dominated by colossal ignorance.  
</em><br>
<p>Using the collective intelligence of many people doesn't have to
<br>
mean listening just to the majority. Good systems amplify useful and
<br>
clever ideas instead. For example, if everybody proposed ideas and
<br>
they were tested, judged and implemented in competition with each
<br>
other, then (assuming the system was working somewhat right) good
<br>
ideas would eventually prevail. This is the evolutionary epistemic
<br>
approach that has worked so well in science, free markets and open
<br>
societies. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Crypto could grow out of seeing our computational resources as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extensions of our own person and therefore as legitimate to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protect from involuntary search and seizure.
</em><br>
<p>Which in turn requires the strengthening of our rights to
<br>
self-determination and our bodies, and the extension of these rights
<br>
outwards.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I could see a more transparent society (in both directions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; public and private) with and only with severe restrictions on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; government and corporate meddling with individual rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is a feedback loop: in a somewhat transparent society, anybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meddling with your rights is more easily exposed, and meddling doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pay as much as before. That helps make the society more transparent. On
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the other hand, the reverse is also true. That is why we need those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; antibodies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I accented the &quot;in both directions&quot; because of some court
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rulings and legislation in the US prohibiting citizens from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recording the actions of public officials although the public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; officials claim every right to snoop on and record private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens and transactions.  Transparency cannot be a 1-way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mirror. 
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. In this case civil disobedience seems called for. 
<br>
<p>One thing I noted about yesterdays disaster was the amount of
<br>
footage. Just a few years ago, most major disasters and accidents
<br>
were shown on the news with the same grainy, shaky footage over and
<br>
over again - somebody had been lucky to bring a camera close, and
<br>
that single tape would be all the record. Now things are different:
<br>
there must have been at least tens of cameras just from the start,
<br>
and later on hundreds. The sheer spread of private recording systems
<br>
is an important factor in being able to not just record abuses, but
<br>
also make it harder to enfoce such one-way court rulings.
