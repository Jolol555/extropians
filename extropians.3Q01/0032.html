<em>&gt;From: Brent Allsop &lt;<a href="mailto:allsop@fc.hp.com?Subject=Re:%20My%20view%20of%20AI.&In-Reply-To=&lt;F41VnWRZgA94Vf8WZ8i00018171@hotmail.com&gt;">allsop@fc.hp.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;	Also, like ALL other popular discussion of the future, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entirely based on the &quot;Turing test&quot; view of lonely consciously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;isolated beings.  The view that we will eternally never really know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what other conscious minds are like other than the causal behavior we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can observe.  Is the boy really feeling pain?  Or is he just a tape
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recorder begging for the pain to stop?  The assumption is that no one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will ever know.
</em><br>
<p>Can you point to specific scenes that advance this view? I didn't get this 
<br>
impression.
<br>
But it's a correct view anyway. Even if you were to mentally interface 
<br>
directly with another being, and then feel consciousness, you'd still always 
<br>
be feeling only your own consciousness. It would be a more intense version 
<br>
of feeling empathy for someone. You wouldn't be able to make any claim about 
<br>
whether the entity is conscious itself, when you're not interfacing with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is my pet peeve and there is no way the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can be like this.  The worlds of our consciousness will expand and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;escape from our skulls.  We will be effing, sharing, merging, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;getting inside other's minds.  Hence the future will be very different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than all this Turring test like behavior.  Surely even the idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individual beings will really no longer exist in the distant future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;	Another utterly stupid assumption the entire plot hinged on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was the idea that once the mother spoke the special words to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;android boy, it would suddenly drastically change him and forever lock
</em><br>
<em>&gt;him into the mind set of only loving the person that spoke the words.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The only thing that could be done to change such would be to destroy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the boy.  It's difficult for us to alter ourselves, but it's absurd to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think that an android couldn't be modified.
</em><br>
<p>Well, he was a beta right? Maybe the rollback feature hadn't been completed 
<br>
yet.
