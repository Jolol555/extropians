<em>&gt;Companies need to be regulated because they often operate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without regard to human values. Governments, too, need to be regulated to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ensure they don't operate without regard for the people they are meant to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;serve. These are simply feedback mechanisms.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, I entirely agree, companies do need to be regulated.  But the do not
<br>
need to be regulated by the government.  No free market economist will tell
<br>
you that a 'free for all' is what we are looking for.  Unions and private
<br>
watch dog groups would be much more influential and usefull in a free market
<br>
environment.  They have no place in our heavily regulated environment
<br>
because the government handles all the regulations, albiet in a expensive
<br>
and innefient manner.  Unions can naturally form in free market
<br>
environments, poor working conditions existed in the early part of this
<br>
century because it was *illegal* for unions to form.  By you implying the
<br>
free markets are *unregulated* it indicates that you have an incorrect
<br>
perception of free markets.  Free market would have no *government*
<br>
regulation, but the industry would self regulate.  Already companies rate
<br>
other products, like Consumer Reports, other companies like United
<br>
Labratoris test and rate products.  Companies and services like this would
<br>
have much larger and powerfull roles.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To remove feedback leads rapidly to things spiralling out of control, as we
</em><br>
have seen so many times 
<br>
<em>&gt;in the past.
</em><br>
<p>Which supports my suspicion that you mis-understand what exactly a free
<br>
market entails.  It is not free reign for companies to do whatever they
<br>
want.  They will be regulated by how much a consumer is willing to pay and
<br>
what that consumer wants in a product.  These are the best forms of
<br>
feedback, instead of a government 'committee' trying to figure out what it
<br>
thinks the best thing for everyone else is, instead of letting the people
<br>
decide for themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Your objections to free markets are more based on your philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;opposition to it the to factual objections.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;No. Mine are practical concerns. &quot;
</em><br>
<p>They appear to be based on misconceptions of free markets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;You often hear in the media and by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;people on the street the phrase &quot;The rich are getting rich and the poor
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;getting poorer&quot; this is not the case.  The Rich are getting richer, but
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;poor are as well.  Just look at the poverty level in the US right now and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;compare it with the poverty level in the 1950's, and then in the early
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;1900's, then to the poor farmers that made up 85% of the population in
</em><br>
1850.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Everyone lives longer healthier lives.  The rich are getting richer, but
</em><br>
so
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;are the poor.  Its just the rich may get richer faster, but the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;global standard of living is increasing
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I agree almost completely... although next time I see a homeless kid, or a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;starving person (rare in Oz) I don't think I shall bother trying to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;convince him that he is better off than his ancestors. (I am not being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sarcastic here -- I really do largely agree -- I am just cautioning that it
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;doesn't apply across the board.)&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The poverty level in america has amenities that other countries would envy.
<br>
Many people on welfare have Heat, Running water, Hot water, a roof, basic
<br>
medical care, free from polio and measles, not to mention a car and
<br>
telephone and a couple of color TV's.  A far cry from the rickety disease
<br>
ridden water logged grass huts with dirt floors from generations ago.  Our
<br>
definition of poverty continues to change as well.  In a few generations
<br>
(Thanks to capitalistic competition) todays lower middle class will be
<br>
considered to be poverty.  But they will still have it far better off then
<br>
previous generations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  and this is directly because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;capitalistic competition.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;No. It is also due to people becoming smarter and well educated,
</em><br>
<p>And how did people become smarter and more educated?  Hmm, first of all the
<br>
printing press, where manufacturing of books entered the mass production
<br>
realm, literacy rates sky rocketed after this.  The printing press spurred
<br>
capitalistic competition to provide people with information.  Farther down
<br>
the road providing an education became a business, and business necessarily
<br>
had to continually get better and cheaper at doing it.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;more tolerant,
</em><br>
<p>One of the primary reasons we are more tolerant today is directly because of
<br>
technology.  Most intolerence is bred on a tribalisitic 'us vs them'
<br>
mentality, a mentality that is easy to perpetuate in a culturally closed
<br>
environment.  The evil communists, the crusades, etc.  All of these were
<br>
based on the perpetuators perception the the enemy was 'different'.  When
<br>
the radio was mass produced and introduced into east and west germany, east
<br>
germany was no longer able to perpetuate the myth that the free west was
<br>
full of pain and suffering.  More and more east germans learned what was
<br>
going on because of the free exchange of information, which ushered an era
<br>
of change, among other things, that led to the collapse of the iron curtain.
<br>
Today we can communicate instantly with anyone in the world.  It would be
<br>
very difficult for someone to convince me that chinese are evil when I have
<br>
four friends that I talk to routinely in china.  Soon we will have
<br>
telephones that can instantly translate anything we say to any language, and
<br>
with that one of the largest remaining inhibitors to cultural unification
<br>
will fall.  
<br>
<p>There are fewer and fewer cultures every generation, they are continually
<br>
getting usurped by other cultures usually for economic reasons.  The ease of
<br>
this intergration comes directly from the technological innovations that
<br>
science and capitalism have wrought.  Soon (~100 years) there will be a
<br>
unified global cultural where national boundaries are as transparent as
<br>
state boundaries are today in the US.  All of this will happen because
<br>
people desire to provide, innovate, distribute, and service because of
<br>
capitalistic incentive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and healthier. 
</em><br>
<p>Um, inexpansive mass produced agriculture?  Which came from capitalistic
<br>
innovation?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Capitalism has a part to play in that change, but beware of overstating its
</em><br>
contribution.
<br>
<p>Capitalism was the biggest part in all of these changes, parralleled only by
<br>
science.  Without science and capitalism we would all be farmers working 16
<br>
to 18 hours a day making just enough food for ourselves, and thats it.
<br>
Think you would have access to books, heat, clothing, hot water, air
<br>
conditioning, medical care, enough food, etc. etc. etc. without science and
<br>
capitalism?  Let alone the free time that is required to explore and develop
<br>
other intellectual persuits, like art, music, culture, etc. etc.  Try doing
<br>
that if you work 18 hours a day in hard physical labor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;If there are people out there who want to be educated, there will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;companies out there willing to educate them, poor or not.  And they could
</em><br>
do
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;it better, cheaper, and faster.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;If that was the case then that is what would happen. So why doesn't it? 
</em><br>
<p>Because school is offered for 'free'  Give everyone back the seven to ten
<br>
thousand dollars that is spent on the average student in public school and
<br>
see how many of them still want to go to 'free' public school.  Let alone
<br>
pay the 7 - 10 grand for it.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't have anything against private schooling. I think it would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wonderful if it became as cheap and accessible as public schooling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;currently is.
</em><br>
<p>That is exactly what we are saying would happen.  It would not only be
<br>
cheaper and more accesible, but better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Capitalism works very well if you are rich. If you are not then you need 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other means. The biggest mistake rich classes make is in supposing that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they don't benefit from the poor improving their lot.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like you have some more misconceptions about free marketers...
<br>
Capitalism doesnt just work very well if you are rich, it works very well
<br>
for everyone, poor and rich.  It is the reason why the global economic
<br>
standards have risen and more and more people live longer and healthier
<br>
lives.  Think of every convenience you have, AC, medicine, electricity, a
<br>
car, a house, etc. etc. etc.  ALl of these were built through 'big business'
<br>
and rich people trying to make products cheaper, better, and more accessible
<br>
to everyone, including the poor.  Those rich people are merely trying to get
<br>
richer, but they are doing so by providing you with something that you want,
<br>
and because there is more then one rich person doing it, they have to make
<br>
it as cheap as possible.
