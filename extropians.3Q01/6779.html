Robert, this post was evil. Not evil in the chuckling &quot;we could
<br>
make the potted plants of luddites start glowing in the dark with
<br>
pro genetic slogans&quot; humorous form of micheviousness, not evil in
<br>
the sense of making life harder or worse for other people, but in
<br>
the worst form of pro-entropy, hasten the heat death of the
<br>
universe form of evil. It had been better if it just had been
<br>
stupid. 
<br>
<p>It is based on two big mistakes, one logical, one ethical. The
<br>
ethical is most serious: you assume that human lives can have
<br>
negative value, and do an essentially utilitarian calculation not
<br>
of happiness, but simply of utility towards a certain goal. Humans
<br>
not promoting this goal are a vaste of resources and a potential
<br>
threat, so eliminate them. Hmm, sounds an awful lot like Skynet
<br>
and other evil Hollywood AIs. But why are you striving in the
<br>
first place towards singularity? Clearly, it must be valuable in
<br>
some way. 
<br>
<p>The core idea of transhumanism is human development, so that we
<br>
can extend our potential immensely and become something new. This
<br>
is based on the assumption that human life in whatever form it may
<br>
be (including potential successor beings) is valuable and worth
<br>
something in itself. It must not be destroyed, because that
<br>
destroys what transhumanism strives to preserve and enhance. Even
<br>
if some humans are not helpful in achieving transhumanity doesn't
<br>
mean their existence is worthless, and if they are an active
<br>
hindrance to your (or anybody elses) plans destroying their lives
<br>
is always wrong as long as they do not initiate force against you. 
<br>
<p>A transhumanism not based on this core does not deserve the
<br>
humanism part of the name. And a transhumanism that bases itself
<br>
on the utilitarist approach of using humans as means to an end
<br>
rather than ends in themselves becomes the ideological twin of
<br>
fascism, with the sole difference that the singularity takes the
<br>
place of the national community in the ideological structure. 
<br>
<p>The logical mistake is to ignore the full consequences of your
<br>
idea, and just look at the &quot;desirable&quot; first-order consequences.
<br>
What you miss is that if this form of &quot;practical genocide&quot; is
<br>
used, then the likeliehood of other forms of &quot;practical genocide&quot;
<br>
are becoming far higher and harder to ethically suppress, as well
<br>
as resistance to the US or other genocidal group is likely to
<br>
become *far* more violent. In short, you make the world far more
<br>
dangerous, more likely to use weapons of mass destruction,
<br>
terrorists more desperate - while at the same time assuming
<br>
accelerating technology.  Doesn't that sound like a recipe for
<br>
total disaster? 
<br>
<p>This post is going to haunt us all - it is in the archives, it has
<br>
been sent to hundreds of list participants. Be assured that in a
<br>
few years, when the current uproar has settled down, somebody is
<br>
going to drag it out and use it against extropianism in the media.
<br>
&quot;So, Max More, is it true that *not all* extropians support the
<br>
plans for genocide you discussed on your internet list?&quot; After
<br>
all, I would be surprised if there are no representatives for the
<br>
&quot;luddites&quot; on this list. 
<br>
<p><p>Frankly, I'm both scared and disgusted with much of the
<br>
discussions on this list over the last week. While the emotional
<br>
distress caused by the disaster is quite excusable, I don't think
<br>
some of the behavior caused by it is excusable.
