<em>&gt; Organised religions have a lot going for them in terms of getting things

</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals for organized religions are fairly diffuse and open to interpretation.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Building upon some earlier remarks made on this list about the futility of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempting to remove religions from the human picture (just as futile as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempting to remove all other corporations because they compete with yours;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're attacking the &quot;symptom&quot; and the &quot;problem&quot; can't be dealt with -- it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just human nature), is there any good reason not to attempt to found and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nurture a purposeful religion? By this I mean one dedicated to -- for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example -- either building or funding the building of God/a god (== true AI)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or achieving immortality. (Both very Gnostic goals, but Gnosticism had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nice long run of things).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Religions seem to be easy to start (on the absolute scale of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endeavors). Easier than founding a government, for example. Or putting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people on the moon. Potentially achievable by two people in a basement with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access to a fax machine, to call to mind one example. It allows for tapping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a wellspring of human motivation; promise(/suggest/hypothesise) later
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness/other benefit in exchange for resouces now. A number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropianist projects fall nicely into that category, mine included.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I have thought about this many times.  It might even be possible
<br>
to organize such an endeavor so that the normal tithes and
<br>
contributions are used directly to fund projects making for
<br>
precisely the sort of future and results that the religion had
<br>
as, or as necessary to its goal states.  The adherents to this
<br>
religion could be workers, beneficiaries and share-holders in
<br>
common of these projects.  
<br>
<p>Another twist I have considered is having information and
<br>
algorithms and the open free access to the same as a absolute
<br>
sacrament of the faith.  Perhaps a special order, say the Order
<br>
of the Hallowed Byte, would be dedicated to Open Source, open
<br>
information and information systems as a crucial key to the
<br>
fastest spread and enhancement of knowledge and capabilities
<br>
essential to reaching the goals of the organization as quickly
<br>
as possible.  I could see such an order having a sub-order of
<br>
Holy Hackers who have taken religious vows to employ their skill
<br>
only under the condition that the software will be open to
<br>
themselves and all others to build upon freely.  
<br>
<p>It might also be possible with such a sacrament in place and
<br>
some of the rulings re religious sacraments already on the books
<br>
for the church to establish a data haven that was relatively
<br>
untouchable even in the middle of the US. 
<br>
<p>A religion based strongly in actual scientific and technological
<br>
tools for making many of the promises and deep desires of
<br>
humanity actualities could pull a lot of the best from
<br>
traditional religions and also give an overhaul vision and since
<br>
of purpose to many techies out there who are relatively cynical
<br>
and are missing such a unifying image of what their work is
<br>
about and leads to.
<br>
<p>A lot of fun and some quite serious good could well come out of
<br>
soemthing like this.
<br>
<p>It is now a bit harder to establish a religion legally.  The IRS
<br>
has some pretty finicky guidelines on what they consider to be a
<br>
&quot;legitimate&quot; religion.
