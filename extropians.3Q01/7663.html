<p>This is getting tedious. You, of course, realize that these challenges are

key space in a few months? That each bit added to the keysize doubles the

search space? That the key size alone doesn't say a lot, unless you also

specify the computational requirements of the algorithm.

<p>Sorry, but this is compleat bullshit. You know how the crunch of the

average computer grows, how many of them are around, and can choose the
<br>
key size so that encryption is still sufficient speedy whereas decryption
<br>
by brute force will remain prohibitive for n years. If you drop the
<br>
&quot;sufficiently speedy&quot; requirement, n can become rather large.

<p>RC5 [Riv95] is a fast block cipher designed by Ronald Rivest for RSA Data
<br>
Security (now RSA Security) in 1994. It is a parameterized algorithm with
<br>
a variable block size, a variable key size, and a variable number of
<br>
rounds. Allowable choices for the block size are 32 bits (for
<br>
experimentation and evaluation purposes only), 64 bits (for use a drop-in
<br>
replacement for DES), and 128 bits. The number of rounds can range from 0
<br>
to 255, while the key can range from 0 bits to 2040 bits in size. Such
<br>
built-in variability provides flexibility at all levels of security and
<br>
efficiency.
<br>
<p>Do you see the difference between 48 bit and 128 bit? Not to speak of 2
<br>
kBit?
