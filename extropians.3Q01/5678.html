<p>MWahahahahaha!!!!
<br>
<p>Ayn Rand escaped from the Soviet revolution in the 'teens as I recall,
<br>
and started writing in the 20's and 30's. She died sometime in the 70's,
<br>
I think, as an old woman. The primary reason she gets little press is
<br>
that she got none in the west then, as literary circles were dominated
<br>
by 'fellow travellers' and other cryptos who were convinced of the
<br>
superiority of socialism and the end of the age of the individual. That
<br>
literary types are not quite so heavily dominated is due in part to
<br>
writers like her, Solzynitsen, and others who worked for decades to pop
<br>
the balloon of fantasy the lefts in the west had about the soviet
<br>
system. NOTE: Some in the west are still deluded, and deal with it in
<br>
different ways, including denying that the soviet system was even
<br>
socialist, preferring to call it 'state capitalism'...
