<p>Huh? Have you really thought through this from an economic point of
<br>
view? Suppose somebody starts to clone a popular star - let's say Geri
<br>
Halliwell. First, how many clones are likely to be created? Given that
<br>
the individual cost of rearing a child is more than $100,000 (and
<br>
cloning even more), few people can afford having several clones. So the
<br>
only way you would get a lot of Halliwell clones is for many families to
<br>
do it, distributing the costs. The exact number who might want to do
<br>
this is uncertain, since one of the strongest driving forces for
<br>
reproductive cloning seems to be the wish to have a genetically related
<br>
child rather than a stranger, so even relatively few of the pro-cloning
<br>
families would want Halliwell clones. But let's say culture changes.
<br>
That means Geri Halliwell now has to compete with a thousand babies.
<br>
They might get into her line of business after perhaps 15 years - at
<br>
which point it is extremely unlikely that the style and culture that
<br>
made the original successful will be in place, and the original is
<br>
going to have changed to some other style. So they will be
<br>
competitors with each other, yes, but given the nature of a merket
<br>
economy that simply implies that they can earn more by doing different
<br>
things. Somehow I doubt all people with the Halliwell genome can do is
<br>
music/looking good - the clones are very likely to find a wide variety
<br>
of niches. 
<br>
<p>So if I'm very successful my genes might become widespread. Hmm, that
<br>
sounds almost like an *incentive* for becoming successful to most
<br>
people. (As for myself, I go the direct way and try to make my memes
<br>
successful - you will all end up as my mental clones! Muhahahah! ;-)=
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Copying of you with your complete
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wasn't talking about nonconsensual copying of minds, but when that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes possible we'll need some way to protect against it as well.
</em><br>
<p>Sure. It is a more serious problem, not just economically but also
<br>
ethically. As Nick Szabo suggested at Extro 5, it is really one of the
<br>
core issues of posthuman freedom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; A simpler possibility would be to add genetic switches expressed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; somatic cell lines that are activated by the pecularities of nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transfer (there has to be some re-methylation process there, I guess)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and then activate a suicide gene. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the cloner knew about this mechanism, he would disable the suicide gene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prior to nuclear transfer. If he didn't know about it, he would probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figure it out after the first couple of cloning attempts failed. So I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think this will work.
</em><br>
<p>You can hide it randomly in the genome, making the cloning far more
<br>
expensive. OK, with full decompilation technology it could be done, but
<br>
then cloning will be a relativiely trivial technology anyway and you
<br>
could start designing encrypted genomes instead.
