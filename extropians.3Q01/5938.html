On Sat, Sep 08, 2001 at 09:25:38PM -0700, Terry W. Colvin quoted Science
<br>
Frontiers
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In a recent article in the *Journal of Scientific Exploration*, R. Van Wijk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tries to reignite interest in &quot;bio-photons&quot; that carry &quot;bio-information.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, he assures us that mitogenetic radiation *is* real, that bio-photons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truly exist.  To thus swim against the scientific mainstream, he reviews
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recent experiments and provides us with a huge bibliography.  Apparently,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mitogenetic radiation is not &quot;pathological science,&quot; as physicist I.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Langmuir called it back in 1953.  Second, Van Wijk advances some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms by which cells can generate bio-photons via their metabolic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and enzymatic processes.  Finally, he comes to the crux of the matter:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do bio-photons really transmit information to neighboring cells and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thereby affect their functions?  Bolstering his claims, Van Wijk cites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confirming modern experiments with seeds, neotrophil cells, dinoflagellates,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and fireflies.  (Fireflies employ bio-photons internally in addition to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their external flashes.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Van Wijk, R.; &quot;Bio-Photons and Bio-Communication,&quot; *Journal of Scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exploration*, 15:183, 2001.)
</em><br>
<p>Wow! By *emphasizing* words, he can make things *true*! (OK, it could be
<br>
the *journal* that does that). 
<br>
<p>Hmm, so this paper claims to prove a rather controversial claim by
<br>
citing a lot of other papers claiming it to be true (from this writeup
<br>
we get no impression of their validity), and then confirms this by
<br>
citing a lot of *confirming* experiments rather than trying to falsify
<br>
the results? And the author starts by assuring the reader that the
<br>
phenomenon he tries to demonstrate exists? Sounds like very bad science
<br>
to me - even if most scientists tend to believe their theories are true,
<br>
they at least try to look at disconfirming evidence. 
<br>
<p>OK, I this is just the impression I get from this blurb. The paper might
<br>
actually be great. But this kind of posting seems to belong to the
<br>
forteana list more than the extropian list.
