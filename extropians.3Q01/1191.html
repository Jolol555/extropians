<p>Surveillance Cameras Incite Protest
<br>
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
AMPA, Fla., July 15 â€” Wearing masks and making obscene gestures at police 
<br>
cameras, about 100 people on Saturday protested a new security system that 
<br>
scans faces in the city's night life district to search for suspects in 
<br>
crimes and runaways.
<br>
<p>&quot;Being watched on a public street is just plain wrong,&quot; said May Becker, 
<br>
wearing a bar code sticker on her forehead.
<br>
<p>Ms. Becker joined demonstrators in the Ybor City district on Saturday night, 
<br>
wearing a sign reading, &quot;We're under house arrest in the land of the free.&quot;
<br>
<p>One protester walked by a camera, gestured obscenely and shouted, &quot;Digitize 
<br>
this!&quot;
<br>
<p>Other protesters wore gas masks, Groucho Marx glasses and other items to 
<br>
protest the FaceIt scanning system the police are using in Ybor City, a 
<br>
neighborhood that attracts thousands of people on weekend nights.
<br>
<p>The cameras snap pictures of faces and compare them with 30,000 images in a 
<br>
database that includes runaways and wanted criminals. The system works by 
<br>
analyzing 80 facial points around the nose, cheekbones and eyes.
<br>
<p>Tampa is the only American city where the police use the technology for 
<br>
routine surveillance, but Virginia Beach is seeking a $150,000 state grant 
<br>
for a similar system.
<br>
<p>The Tampa police say the system, which has been used in Ybor City the last 
<br>
two weekends, has led to no arrests.
