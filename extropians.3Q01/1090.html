<p>
Party of Citizens keeps referring to &quot;the religion of Scientism&quot;.
<br>
<p>Isn't this a bit of a cliche? It's one regularly trotted out by religious 
<br>
apologists and by humanist sentimentalists about religion.
<br>
<p>And, in case you're tempted to retort that cliches usually contain a grain 
<br>
of truth (which I accept), most of us who admire the advancement of science 
<br>
do *not* treat it as a religion. We favour rational inquiry into nature 
<br>
through methods such as observation, experiment, mathematical modelling, 
<br>
formal logic, hypothetico-deductive reasoning. The conclusions we come to 
<br>
are provisional. Where the more precise methods of science break down, we 
<br>
still favour rational techniques such as logic and consilience, the methods 
<br>
of philosophy.
<br>
<p>(There is no sharp line between philosophical inquiry and scientific 
<br>
inquiry: to my way of thinking, evolutionary psychology, for example, is 
<br>
still more a field of philosophy rather than of science because it cannot 
<br>
easily use precise experiments and has to rely heavily on consilience 
<br>
arguments. But there's nothing wrong with that.)
<br>
<p>This was not the approach adopted by religious thinkers in founding their 
<br>
encyclopedic explanatory systems. Nor is it generally the approach of modern 
<br>
religious believers in coming to believe - usually through some kind of 
<br>
mystical experience or else by childhood indoctrination.
<br>
<p>The difficulty for religions is that the methods of rational investigation 
<br>
have gradually explained aspects of nature in ways that are still 
<br>
provisional but have pretty much eliminated many of the answers previously 
<br>
given by religions. Many religious explanations of phenomena are now otiose. 
<br>
Sophisticated religions have had to adapt to all this by developing 
<br>
theological methods which re-interpret holy books, etc, in the light of 
<br>
well-established scientific theory (something that St Augustine first hinted 
<br>
at and which Galileo developed - it was this now-orthodox theological 
<br>
suggestion as much as anything else which got him into trouble with the Pope 
<br>
and the Inquisition).
<br>
<p>If there is something that can legitimately be called &quot;scientism&quot;, I don't 
<br>
think you'll find many believers in it on this list. Attacking such a 
<br>
supposed &quot;religion&quot; is a pretty obvious straw man argument.
<br>
<p>Of course, you can use the word &quot;religion&quot; to refer to any world view at 
<br>
all, if you like. But that just renders the word useless. It does not 
<br>
detract from the fact that there is a quite familiar sense in which we can 
<br>
distinguish between religious world views and world views based on 
<br>
scientific and/or philosophical inquiry.
