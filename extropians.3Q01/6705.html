<em>&gt; &gt;For the sake of reason. Please GROW UP. No one expects terrorists operating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;from fundamentalist, irrational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;assumptions about the world to keep their intellect in gear. Rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;foolishly i did expect that to happen on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;list. Apparently i have been sadly mistaken.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;These constant calls for full blooded revenge, are getting tedious. In some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cases are getting towards the level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;Bar room arguments&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In all fairness i have to say some of the list members who's views on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;issue are closer to my own, have indulged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in some rather direct personal attacks over the past days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It was my understanding that this list existed for presumably, balanced,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;intelligent, rational, humans to discuss various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;ideas and concept pertaining to science, technology, and related social 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Some of the behavior on this list just shows that despite many ppl having a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Promethean self image, many of us are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;far from the peek of human development.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;If ppl can't make some kind of intelligent salient point about the issue (
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;which for quite a few list members i
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;can easily  understand ) i for one would be more than happy if they would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hold back until they have calmed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;down enough to make rational statements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Surly one primary Extropian value is the concept of ones intellect being in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;primary control of ones conscious actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;at all times. If we allow ourselves to loose rational self-control we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;become little better than the fools who caused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Tuesdays destruction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Please express your thoughts and ideas, but don't just rant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Anger is a rational emotional response to atrocity, but once rage passes, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it should be replaced by steely, cold and calculating implacable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relentless anger.  The 'people' we are dealing with have demonstrated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amazing focus, intensity, perseverence and singlemindeddness in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pursuit of their sick and twisted goals; they trained as moles, in and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outside of my country, for years - just so they could successfully kill 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves while taking as many of us as possible with them, in a bid for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heaven.  Such people must be rooted out and destroyed, as well as those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who so program them, and, make no mistake about it, it will be done, with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or without the help or approval of anyone on this list.
</em><br>
<p>It's not a matter of anyone anywhere approving US action/reaction to the 
<br>
events at WTC and Washington. I have no doubt that as with many other items 
<br>
of foreign policy the US is relatively unconcerned about the approval of 
<br>
outsiders. Rather the discussion imho is about what kind of actions are
<br>
more or less likely to prevent another terrible terrorist attack. IMHO and 
<br>
in the opinion of other ppl on this list and around the world, 
<br>
indiscriminate revenge attacks on Afghanistan and it's ppl will do nothing 
<br>
to ensure the long term future security of the US and it's citizens. Whilst 
<br>
eradicating Bin Laden and his supports would certainly remove one threat, 
<br>
in short term. Only a mutually inclusive resolution of the issues that 
<br>
cause the friction
<br>
between the Muslim world and the US can possibly succeed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And especially without the nonexistent help of navel-gazing analysis 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paralysis types or self-hating sycophantic citizen versions of Uncle Tom 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shuffling to the terrorist tune.
</em><br>
On one final note Joe Dees. I'd like you to clarify the above remarks, 
<br>
particularly the &quot;self-hating sycophantic citizen versions of Uncle Tom 
<br>
shuffling to the terrorist tune&quot;. Since the reference to Uncle Tom has 
<br>
specific racial significance.
<br>
Whilst &quot;shuffling to a terrorist tune&quot; suggest at the least a tacit 
<br>
acceptance of the terrorist attack as justified. A position that i have 
<br>
been at some pains within all my posts to make clear i do not hold.
<br>
Are these remarks directed at me personally. If so i take great exception 
<br>
at them, and this personal attack from you will serve only to reinforce my 
<br>
already dubious opinion of your comments on this list.
<br>
You may also wish to reflect on the fact that in my criticism of your 
<br>
earlier remarks, at no time did i make attacks of personal nature.
