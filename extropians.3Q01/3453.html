</em><br>
<p>I mean the &quot;basic&quot; right or &quot;natural&quot; right which some view it as one
<br>
duty of the law to encode.  For instance, the famous American right to
<br>
free speech (even if it has been poorly implemented by American law
<br>
recently, IMO).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; ...Otherwise, the only ethical activity for all human beings would be

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The *only* ethical activity?  I'm sure that you don't mean to put that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in anyone's mouth.  You are probably criticizing the view that I hold,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; namely, that all other things being equal, there should be the maximum
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the quality of our own lives (for the sake of our aforementioned selfishness).
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I was criticizing a view slightly different from yours, which
<br>
holds that there should be the maximum number possible of beings
<br>
*regardless of all other considerations*, which is the viewpoint I see
<br>
a number of so-called &quot;pro-life&quot; arguments holding.  A mother will
<br>
necessarily spend much of her own resources in having (and, usually,
<br>
raising) a baby (usually in concert with a father), which could
<br>
otherwise be used to raise the parents' quality of life.  If one
<br>
deliberately wishes to spend these resources, then fine, but if one
<br>
finds oneself pregnant under circumstances where one does not wish to -
<br>
or is unable to safely - expend them, then one should not be forced to
<br>
degrade one's future life in this manner.  The viewpoint I criticize
<br>
holds that even unwanted embryos must be given the chance to live, no
<br>
matter the cost to anyone else.
<br>
<p>Make no mistake, it is the cost I object to, not the new life itself.
<br>
If pregnancy and raising children were cost free, this would be a
<br>
nonissue - but that is far from the case today.
