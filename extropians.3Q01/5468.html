</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Unrestrained capitalism (think early industrial US) leads to huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; discrepancies in the distribution of wealth, which leads to social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; unrest (think the early labor movement) and even upheaval (think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; French Revolution).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Uh, the French Revolution was a revolution against the ruling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;class, against aristocracy and subjection by force and the lack
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of freedom to one's own life and to rise.  It was in no way a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;revolution against capitalism, unrestrained or otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, but it *was* a revolution against the &quot;huge discrepancies in the 
<br>
distribution of wealth.&quot;  Which was my point.

<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
