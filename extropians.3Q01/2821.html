<p>
Alex Bokov on the whole has some excellent advice
<br>
for everyone:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * Above all, let's recognize what we all have in common-- reliance on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational thought, a fascination with science and technology, and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conviction that they will redefine our lives and our reality... for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the better. All other issues are secondary to that. Even the wrongest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list regular probably still 'gets it' more than your typical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phone-psychic user... or your typical elected official for that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * Perhaps the reason there is so much backlash against concerns over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discrimination and economic inequality is that Libertarian thinkers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been asleep on the job. We're letting the Democrats and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Socialists own human rights and anytime somebody raises a legitimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concern, we respond to them as if they have already shown themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be a PC meme-bot.
</em><br>
<p>Alas, this process is called &quot;political polarization&quot;, and proceeds
<br>
as follows.  If you lean somewhat slightly in any direction, then
<br>
you see it as your job to pull (just as if it was the rope game
<br>
&quot;tug of war&quot;) towards the side the opposite to where most people
<br>
seem to be.  Thus, if you are rather left of center, you will be
<br>
entirely silent on matters that right-wingers are noisy about, 
<br>
since you figure that they're already doing the job.  In the same
<br>
way, libertarians are less prone to speak out against pollution
<br>
and racism, because they figure that environmentalists and liberals
<br>
are speaking out about it, and too loudly, all the time.
<br>
<p>You're not going to succeed in trying to stop polarization, but
<br>
it is important for someone like you to speak up occasionally
<br>
and remind everyone of what's going on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * Those who do have liberal/statist leanings are not blameless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either. Some of the most virulent opposition to technology is coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the radical left. Why is it that every environmental and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civil-rights activist I run into has the same ignorant, simplistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view of science, progress, and economics?
</em><br>
<p>To take this last question literally, it is because you do not
<br>
know enough environmentalists nor enough civil-rights activists.
<br>
<p>Lee
