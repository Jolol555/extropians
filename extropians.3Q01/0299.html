I've GOT to signal this British site to the list!
<br>
<p>A bit of background: some time ago there was a magazine called LM. I read a 
<br>
few issues and was wondering if the acronym stood for Libertarian Monthly... 
<br>
To my amazament, I eventually found out that years ago it used to be called 
<br>
Living Marxism! However, that was before a few changes of ownership...
<br>
<p>Anyways, the magazine went belly-up over a year ago and I just found out 
<br>
that the same people have set up a website:
<br>
<a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/sections/central/index.htm">http://www.spiked-online.com/sections/central/index.htm</a>
<br>
<p>A quick look at the science section should be enough to see why it may be of 
<br>
interest to the list. As an example, I am posting an article, below.
<br>
<p>Also worth a look is the Institute of Ideas (somehow connected to 
<br>
Spiked-online): <a href="http://www.instituteofideas.com">http://www.instituteofideas.com</a>

<br>
<p>At last - a pop group willing to take a stand against the greens and the 
<br>
softies.
<br>
<p>Mobius Dick - who describe themselves as a 'techno band that takes 
<br>
technology seriously' - argue that 'technology is the most important force 
<br>
in the world today'. And they're not afraid to make enemies - having spoken 
<br>
out against Bill Joy, co-founder and chief scientist at Sun Microsystems, 
<br>
whose warnings against the developments in nano-technology, robotics and 
<br>
genetic engineering shook the scientific community in the USA.
<br>
<p>Joy is concerned that unrestrained technological developments could threaten 
<br>
the future of the human race - and is calling for limits, voluntary or 
<br>
imposed, on what scientists can do. But AG Android, frontman for Mobius 
<br>
Dick, thinks Joy is rather paranoid:
<br>
<p>'Machines are already your servants, in time they will be your friends, 
<br>
perhaps even your lovers. Some kind of change is inevitable and people need 
<br>
to think about what kind. But inducing fear in others won't cut it. There 
<br>
are a lot of options out there and we need to see what they are and decide 
<br>
what we want.'
<br>
<p>Mobius Dick claim to have been 'originally founded by our 
<br>
great-grandfathers, whose efforts to make steam-powered synthesisers failed 
<br>
amid a cloud of coal smoke'. Perhaps more believably, they argue that 
<br>
generation by generation we get more used to technological advances that 
<br>
seem frightening at first.
<br>
<p>'Of course the future seems scary now', sings AG Android in the song Embrace 
<br>
the Machine. 'But these cheesy science-fiction sound effects were scary to 
<br>
your parents and grandparents when science and the atom seemed scary and 
<br>
new. Now those old movies seem homey and reassuring. That's how it will be 
<br>
for your children and grandchildren.'
<br>
<p>'Cloning seems frightening now', says Android. 'One day it will just 
<br>
seem…quaint.'
<br>
<p>Mobius Dick's new album Got Dick? is available now. To hear tracks from it, 
<br>
or to find out more abound the band, visit the Mobius Dick page on the MP3
