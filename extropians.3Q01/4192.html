<p><em>&gt; I keep hearing The Bell Curve being brought up.  The Human Genome Project
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has denounced it.  Everything I've read about it makes me think it's &quot;crank&quot;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Bell Curve a good report card?
</em><br>
<p>Hi Olga,
<br>
<p>Our book discussion group read it many years ago.  At least one member was
<br>
expecting &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; to be very wrong in its claims.  That person,
<br>
Chris Hibbert, a longtime contributor to this list (and who I am pretty
<br>
sure does not mind me saying this), came away after reading the book 
<br>
pretty convinced by it.
<br>
<p>No one that I've ever heard (or read) suggests that it is a crank work.  The
<br>
worst I've heard is that some people think that Herrnstein &amp; Murray are
<br>
wrong.  Very little of the book has to do with race.  It's almost entirely
<br>
an analysis of what we mean by &quot;intelligence&quot;, whether there is such a
<br>
thing as &quot;g&quot;, and the effects on society this last century due to the
<br>
widespread use of IQ tests.
<br>
