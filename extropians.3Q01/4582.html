<p>Yeah.  But don't overlook America's geographical blessings.  A huge resource

rich land, occupied only by hunter-gatherers, and not many of those when

smallpox was done with them, whom we were willing to kick around.  And then we

managed to occupy most of it, effectively gaining the defense advantages of
<br>
being an island (Canada being too small to be a threat, and Mexico being too

backward (except in things such as abolishing slavery -- remember why Texans
<br>
wanted to secede from Mexico! so they could have slaves) without the normal

economic disadvantages of being an island (being too small.)

<p>&quot;America has invested her religion as well as her morality in sound
<br>
income-paying securities.  She has adopted the unassailable position of a
<br>
nation blessed because it deserves to be blessed; and her sons, whatever other
<br>
theologies they may affect or disregard, subscribe unreservedly to this
<br>
national creed.&quot;
