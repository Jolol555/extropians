<em>&gt;I also note that nobody has changed their agenda on either side of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aisle.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Nobody? Not even you?
<br>
&nbsp;I am disappointed that so few people on this list want to demonstrate their
<br>
willingness to change their beliefs in response to new evidence.
<br>
&nbsp;Some of the opinions that I have changed are:
<br>
&nbsp;- I'm no longer interested in stopping hate-crime laws. I still think they
<br>
have problems, but the potential harm from a small number of anti-arab
<br>
crimes causing the arab world to unite against us now appears more important
<br>
than the other effects.
<br>
&nbsp;- I plan to reduce my criticisms of moderate religions. Getting people
<br>
to convert from religious beliefs that glorify suicide to beliefs that
<br>
discourage suicide appears more feasible and valuable than persuading
<br>
people to abandon religion entirely.
<br>
&nbsp;- The U.S. support for the Afghans who were fighting the Soviet invasion
<br>
was a mistake. I can imagine that there was a good way to do it (distribute
<br>
weapons equally to the average Afghani), but I can't see how the U.S.
<br>
government could have been persuaded to prefer such an approach to the
<br>
approach of channelling the weapons to a few of the most effective thugs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;have seen Republicans insisting that we were not heading for a recession
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before this attack, and that Bush had turned to economy around.  They say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the terrorists have put us into a recession.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I amazed by the number of people who think the attack will cause a decline
<br>
in gdp lasting longer than a few weeks.
<br>
&nbsp;Most wars and natural disasters show either little effect, or appear to
<br>
cause an increase in economic activity. The only exception that comes to
<br>
mind is the gulf war, where the increase in oil prices may have outweighed
<br>
other effects.
<br>
&nbsp;Maybe people think economic harm and a reduction in gdp are synonymous.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;As to whether we were already in recession, the U.S. uses an official
<br>
definition of recession that generally doesn't tell us that we were in
<br>
one until it is over. If we based the definition on industrial production
<br>
figures (as I gather is done elsewhere) or the NAPM index, we would already
<br>
have agreed that we are in a recession.
