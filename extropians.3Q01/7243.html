<em>&gt; &lt;&gt; Consider the confused but dangerous yammering of the &quot;anti-globalists.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where do they stand?  Their program of cultural balkanaziation

<em>&gt; provides the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfect breeding ground for bin Laden's vermin.  They are without doubt an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unwitting fifth column for his brand of international &quot;cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because in the deeply divided world they seek to create, Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentalism will thrive as a powerful and motivated universalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideology. Bush defined at least the beginnings of an internationalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentality that can be premised on values strong enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; withstand both the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calls of the critics to step back from progress and the jihad of the armed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mullahs.  Again, if Bush has begun the process of recasting the West's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity in terms of vigorous self-confidence, then we have indeed seen a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;pivotal moment in history&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>This is the most important thing.  I am proud of the way Bush handled this.
<br>
His speech and planning is the best I have seen from a U.S. president in a
<br>
long time.
<br>
<p>However...  My fear is that his support is based on the immediate emotional
<br>
reaction to recent events.  There are many fundamentalist factions within
<br>
our own country and around the world that don't want to be part of the
<br>
global community.  There are religious leaders in this country that do not
<br>
want to protect what they consider to be false religions.  There are
<br>
isolationists who do not want to mingle or cooperate with other people.  I
<br>
fear that much of the fervor is being driven not just by patriots and those
<br>
fighting for good, but also by those who want to use this as an excuse to
<br>
become more isolationist.
<br>
<p>As the years pass, and our targets become more and more diverse, I expect to
<br>
see support waning.  After the WTC and Pentagon attackers are dealt with,
<br>
how many people want to risk American lives to stop terrorism in the Middle
<br>
East?  How many people want the U.S. to be part of a global task force
<br>
instead of a single military leader?  How many people want to increase
<br>
international cooperation, commerce, immigration and trade?  There is a lot
<br>
of support now due to selfish U.S. interests.  I commend Bush for taking the
<br>
larger and more long-term view of this crisis.  However when the immediate
<br>
threat is gone, and it comes time to risk American lives to protect foreign
<br>
cultures from foreign terrorism, I am not sure how strong the American
<br>
resolve will be maintained.
<br>
<p>Although this crisis has united Americans and all civilized countries in the
<br>
short term, I am predicting that we will see more desperate retaliation from
<br>
racists, isolationists, nationalist, religionists, and luddites from within
<br>
our own ranks.  The attack of religionists against gays, liberals and the
<br>
ACL has already occurred.  The battle over privacy and encryption has
<br>
already begun.  Battles over due process, search and seizure, and homeland
<br>
security restrictions will be next.  This crisis has strengthened the
<br>
resolve various subcultures, but it has also intensified the contrast
<br>
between differing agendas.
