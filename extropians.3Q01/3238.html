<p><em>&gt; [Lee wrote]

<em>&gt;&gt; I note your use of their last names.  Do I infer correctly that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; if you agreed with them, you would refer to them differently?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If so, do you approve of the general principle of referring to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people differently based upon whether we agree with them or not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you are really grasping at straws here Lee. 
</em><br>
<p>My efforts were, and in this mail continue to be, to attain an
<br>
unbiased level of discussion of the discomfort behind these issues.
<br>
I would welcome criticism of what I write too, especially if it were
<br>
to show methodical bias (fail to be objective).  If we cannot
<br>
even *refer* to each other without tendentiousness or partisanship,
<br>
we'll certainly get nowhere trying to tackle these &quot;uncomfortable
<br>
discussions&quot;, which is part of the subject of this thread.  That's
<br>
why what I wrote was relevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; But some of the puke that Lorrey and Molloy came up with did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; not amount to discussion and it is no wonder it was pounced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; upon by many here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Puke?  Can you honestly defend the use of such language?  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know, you are supporting the contention that many liberals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (or whatever they're called where you come from) really are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; less capable of being fair and objective in discussion.  (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have not seen enough evidence of that, but you are adding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to what evidence there is.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this case I agree with the poster.  Some of the remarks were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite tasteless.  Ignoring that point to counter-attack does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem helpful at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, but I don't entirely believe that you plonked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; them because of the frequency of their posts, and the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that they had nothing &quot;worthwhile&quot; to say.  You can refute
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; me by saying how many other people you have plonked, oh,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; say in the last year---*who were not ideological adversaries
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of yours*!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the poster has absolutely no need to refute your presumptions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about whether the reasons given are the actual reasons or not.
</em><br>
<p>Of course not.  He or she may allow my assertions to stand, and
<br>
thereby survive potential criticism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't like to simply label people myself but the above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement is absurd in that it is contradictory.  You can not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make such a sweeping generalization about an entire race
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relative to others without uttering a racist remark. So the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person may or may not *be* racist but they definitely hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racist opinions and obviously racist remarks.
</em><br>
<p>We are in total agreement.  The person does not have to be
<br>
racist in order to have uttered a remark that either appears
<br>
to be, or is, racist.  That's what I was saying.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; [He] doesn't make a lot of sense if you ask me.   The [his] words
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; sound noble, that we face up to contrary opinions, but practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; considerations intrude. Endlessly debating racism as a potentially valid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; viewpoint every time it reared its ugly head might be OK if we were already
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; immortal, but who has the time? You only need to show it is a mistake once
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; then move on. Avoid wrestling with a pig -- the pig enjoys it and you get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; covered in mud.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It sounds to me as if you underestimate the deepness of ideological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; disagreements.  You cannot expect to &quot;show some view is a mistake&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; only once, as if it were an exercise in algebra.  Here, you also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; equate some people, by metaphor, to pigs---I am certain that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; don't really mean that.  But the carelessness of your remarks (e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;pig&quot; and &quot;puke&quot;) show that you have little worry about negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; emotions affecting your rational decisions and statements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't agree the remarks are careless and I find some of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments strike me as bordering on dishonest sophistry.
</em><br>
<p>Would you please be more specific?  Which parts of my foregoing
<br>
paragraph strike you as dishonest sophistry?   By saying &quot;careless&quot;,
<br>
I was trying to be kind; I was implying that if the writer had time
<br>
(which is explicitly denied in the above paragraph) then the 
<br>
writer could have chosen less offensive terminology.
<br>
<p>Speaking of offensive use of language---which you will find entirely
<br>
absent in any of my sentences in this post---you descended rather
<br>
quickly to implying that I was &quot;bordering&quot; on dishonesty or sophistry.
<br>
Do you have internal filters in place to, in most cases, prevent such
<br>
descriptions of the person who you are talking to from leaking out
<br>
and being actually said or written?
<br>
<p>Please carefully backup accusations with something; one-liners like
<br>
&quot;...some of your arguments border on dishonest sophistry&quot; are not
<br>
necessarily improper, if sustained by argumentation.
<br>
<p>Lee
