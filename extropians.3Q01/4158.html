</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not in the case of LaPaz, since he was a transportee directly from

</em><br>
<p>Oh, I thought the character in question was Manny, not Prof LaPaz. 
<br>
Carradine is, I think, too recognizable for many roles- some relatively
<br>
obscure but skilled actor would be a better choice.
<br>
<p>As for Michael Butler's objection- 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are we casting for PC cartoon diversity roll call [&quot;Negro!&quot; &quot;Here!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Asian!&quot; &quot;Here!&quot; &quot;Girl!&quot; &quot;Here!&quot; &quot;Redhead!&quot;...], or for the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actor for the part? Hmm? I mean, that might be what happened to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Juan Rico in the mostly execrable _John Verhoeven's Starship Troopers_ [sic].
</em><br>
<p>-I agree that the flavor of the novel does need some careful and
<br>
respectful attention.  In a way, it seems that Verhoeven tried to
<br>
denigrate Heinlein's concepts, but *failed*.  One of the tougher roles
<br>
to get right without making it silly is little Hazel, of course.
