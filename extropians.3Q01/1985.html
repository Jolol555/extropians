<em>&gt; I agree, I would like to believe that what most of the G-8
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protesters are really concerned with is a loss of diversity.
</em><br>
<p>A lot of globalization critics of course think they are fighting
<br>
diversity loss - they see a world that has turned into McWorld. I would
<br>
argue that this is untrue, that we are in fact getting a far more
<br>
diverse world where there is both McDonalds *and* traditional
<br>
restaurants, where both pop culture and traditional cultures go global
<br>
and where creolization runs rampant.
<br>
<p>I am sitting here in Stockholm in the middle of the night mailing across
<br>
the world while my video shows _Ghost in the Shell_, which is right now
<br>
quoting the Bible but referring to transhumanist ideas. In the
<br>
background of the anime there is techno music that probably derives from
<br>
some western source mixed with ancient Japanese music. My various
<br>
computers participate in distributed computing tasks that have no real
<br>
allegiance to any culture save the scientific culture. My meal included
<br>
indian elements but was likely made somewhere in Denmark. I love it! If
<br>
this is McWorld, I want fries with that.
<br>
<p>But the critics of course doesn't view it like that, and would probably
<br>
think that I have lost touch with my Swedish soul. And since they think
<br>
that soul is the most important thing (even if I don't value it or even
<br>
think it exists) they feel they have to save me from myself.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;World trade, of course. I believed in world government when I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a kid, but I have gradually come to realise the strength in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;diversity and the need to have different solutions being tested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;different places. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I went through a socialist/world government phase myself, and once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again we seem to agree.
</em><br>
<p>I think a lot of people do. It is one of those big, simple ideas that
<br>
seem to make so much sense. Reality is complex and messy instead.
