<br>
<p><em>&gt;1: It does annoy me to be driving around on roads that I know for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a fact can be built and maintained by private methods.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2: I don't have the perfect blueprint for Utopia, but I can tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you one thing, that it wouldn't be funded via taxation(theft). The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only honest purpose of government in my opinion is the police,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;judicial system, and the military. All these things could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;funded through voluntary methods (Lotteries, contract protection
</em><br>
<em>&gt;payments, etc.... use your imagination)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I would have hoped that a discussion list as open minded and as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clever as this, could not only imagine a moral government as such,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but would probably be able to go that next step beyond where I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and actually design some of the workings of it. How many people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here, when trying to convey topics that we deal with (A.I,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nanotech, etc.) hear &quot;That's impossible or&quot; &quot;Its WAY off
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the future beyond where we will be able to see it&quot;? Stretch a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bit here, don't give up on a moral government because you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think its possible, find a way to make it work! Close the holes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any gaps someone points out and thank them for helping. Look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the frameworks already put together for designing A.I., they may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not be exact specific instructions on what code to enter, but its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a start. Doesn't everyone agree that theft (taking property
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without permission) is wrong in principle? What about the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that it is wrong to initiate force or fraud?
</em><br>
<p>You're probably not going to be surprised to learn that this
<br>
subject has been discussed here many times.
<br>
<p>We're still open to new ideas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The biggest hurdle I cant get past personally is this majority
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rule thing. Why does 51% of the population get to hold the magic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;excalibur and wield total control over the other 49%? What
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principle allows this and what supports it? No, I don't have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alternative, but me not having the answer doesn't mean that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is the best we can do... I never said I was a genius, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't take a 200 IQ to grasp basic principles and know when your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not following them. Rather then trying to answer back to this with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the usual screeching of being practical, try to think of a way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make the principled approach the only practical solution, then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will have done more for freedom then any government program could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have ever done.
</em><br>
<p>The condition you refer to is known as extreme democracy and is a
<br>
very bad thing, it is also what the U.S. is very close to these
<br>
days.
<br>
<p>Like I said, discussed here many times, and we're still open to new
<br>
ideas.
