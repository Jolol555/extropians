</em><br>
<p>Oh, absolutely. (Minor miracle: for the second time in a day Mike Lorrey
<br>
says something Charlie Stross agrees with without reservations.) This is
<br>
one area where adopting UK electoral practices would be good for you. In
<br>
the UK, there are really strict caps on how much money anyone can spend
<br>
on an election campaign for public office -- the combined total for
<br>
a general election (equivalent to a presidential and a congressional
<br>
race rolled into one) is about 80 million pounds for _all_ candidates
<br>
and parties combined. Once someone declares that they're a candidate,
<br>
_all_ their expenses must be audited by the election oversight people;
<br>
if they over-spend, their candidacy is declared void.  Anonymous gifts
<br>
or donations, or attempts to evade the auditing, get you disqualified
<br>
from an election you've won, and at worst can get you a prison sentence:
<br>
it's classified as electoral fraud.
<br>
<p>The rationale for this is that the state pays for TV/radio time for all
<br>
national parties -- they're not allowed to buy additional advertising --
<br>
and the idea is to provide a level playing field for campaigns. Which
<br>
in turn means that you can't buy a British election for cash on the
<br>
barrel-head.
<br>
<p>(You may be able to buy it in more subtle ways --  it's interesting to
<br>
note that the bill for Labour's 2001 party conference is being paid for
<br>
by McDonald's -- but the electoral process itself is supposed to be
<br>
scrupulously fair. Or else.)
