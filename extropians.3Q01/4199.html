<p>Hmmm... I am not so sure about that.
<br>
<p>Do we know the difference between a smart person and a stupid one? I can 
<br>
point at someone I feel is intelligent and someone else who is metally 
<br>
retarded, yes. But when it comes to explaining why I point at them things 
<br>
get much harder. It becomes worse when you try to compare people of 
<br>
different social backgrounds, or people who are &quot;normal&quot; (what the hell is 
<br>
that?) and a savant who may have severe brain damage.
<br>
<p>Yes, IQ tests measure something... but what? About the only answer that 
<br>
anybody has been able to come up with that makes any sense to me is that IQ 
<br>
tests measure how well someone does at IQ tests. I am not being sarcastic 
<br>
here. I really worry that IQ tests are not really very useful.
<br>
<p>Susan Hampshire (the actress) would do very badly on an IQ test -- she is 
<br>
dislexic and can't read. However she has developed the remarkable ability 
<br>
to remember a script after having had it read to her just once.
<br>
<p>I supposedly have a very high IQ, but I am in many ways a complete idiot. I 
<br>
have no sense of time and can't remember numbers. (Do you have any idea how 
<br>
stupid I feel in a job interview when asked for my age and embarrassedly 
<br>
have to say &quot;Err... hang on, umm, 2001 minus 1953... that's ummm...) So 
<br>
what does IQ measure? I don't think it really measures how smart someone is.
<br>
<p>:-)
<br>
<p>Best wishes,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
