<em>&gt;From: Miriam English &lt;<a href="mailto:miriam@werple.net.au?Subject=Re:%20capitalist%20religion&In-Reply-To=&lt;200107171452.HAA12515@well.com&gt;">miriam@werple.net.au</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I just think it is a little rash of you to say that. Profit motive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sees much more &quot;sense&quot; in promoting expensive medical maintenance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;programs that keep people on medications for the rest of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lives. Medical companies don't like to spend money on researching
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ways to prevent or cure ills. That cuts out their market.
</em><br>
<p>The big advantage is that there is more than one company involved.
<br>
Pharmaceutical companies are always trying to undercut each other,
<br>
and it's in the best interest of my prescription drug service
<br>
company to find me a cure rather than shelling out money for
<br>
prilosec every month. That's how competition (the heart of
<br>
capitalism) works.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Many of the great success stories in clobbering diseases are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;publicly funded. They drive such things as health and sanitation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education, and vaccination programs. Of course these then provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the market and incentive for corporations to refine and supply the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vaccines, etc. Both sides (capitalist and publicly funded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organizations) need each other to create a balanced environment.
</em><br>
<p>Initially many of these efforts were too expensive for early
<br>
companies to fund, some still are. Government and private industry
<br>
working together can sometimes be more effective than either apart.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If we had just capitalism managing medicine then we would see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incredibly expensive medicine that would serve the rich (that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where the money is), but not much else.
</em><br>
<p>Actually capitalism is the ruling factor in medicine here in the
<br>
U.S., arguably the best in the world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If we had only publicly managed medicine then we would see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;medicine ossify and become more and more entrenched in tradition.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Neither is the whole solution. Diversity, as in most things, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;important.
</em><br>
<p>Reasonable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I worry when the economic rationalist religion is propagated as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the ultimate truth. It isn't. The world just isn't that simple.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Did you know that many people who travel to USA worry about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;getting ill while over there and accruing massive and crippling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;medical bills for treatment that in Australia or UK or Europe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be relatively inconsequential? Your medical system is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heavily privatized and the most expensive on the planet.
</em><br>
<p>Obviously these people have never heard of travelers medical
<br>
insurance, try Google, very reasonable and it will cover
<br>
everything.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Don't get me wrong. I am not saying the US medical system is crap.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It has its uses -- its advantages and disadvantages... but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't make it better than other systems. In fact American
</em><br>
<em>&gt;medicine is becoming irrelevant to large parts of its own society
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thru its inability to attend to the needs of the great numbers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;poor.
</em><br>
<p>I say the american medical system is the best on the planet, as
<br>
indicated from the fact that people from every other system come
<br>
here for treatment.
<br>
<p>Poor people here can get treatment, they just don't like having to
<br>
wait, or not having many options.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Darn... I have this horrible, sinking feeling I have just started
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a patriotic, capitalist, flame war... oops.  :-)
</em><br>
<p>Not at all, but like Robert suggested in another thread, lets stick
<br>
to the facts.
