<p>Yes, it sounds that way at first doesn't it. However think of it from the 
<br>
point of view of the Fijians of Indian heritage. Their parents or 
<br>
grandparents came out to Fiji and have worked hard to establish their 
<br>
businesses. They have paid their way, been good law-abiding citizens, and 
<br>
have done nothing to harm the indiginous Fijians, who have traditionally 
<br>
run the place. But many (though not all of course) of the Indian-decended 
<br>
have a strong work ethic and many have become legitimately wealthy. Also 
<br>
they have prized western education highly. These factors have led to them 
<br>
rising to positions of influence. The people if Indian heritage have not 
<br>
indulged in reprehensible tactics like mass murder to attain their place in 
<br>
society, and suddenly they find some (not all) native Fijians want to 
<br>
discriminate against them based on their race.
<br>
<p>Of course I can see things from the native Fijians' point of view too 
<br>
(though I must emphisise that not all native Fijians hold this viewpoint). 
<br>
They welcome people into their country not realising that they come from a 
<br>
pressure-cooker society that has ingrained the desire to attain wealth and 
<br>
social standing. Gradually the native Fijians find themselves feeling 
<br>
marginalised as the newcomers institute something of an economic arms race. 
<br>
The native Fijians place a high value upon a relaxed lifestyle and find 
<br>
themselves becoming almost irrelevant in their own land. Suddenly the 
<br>
native-decended Fijians see people of a different race in powerful 
<br>
positions, with even the prime minister of the country being of Indian descent.
<br>
<p>Both these views are extreme, and almost caricatures. Most people would 
<br>
occupy some place between these poles. But this serves to illustrate what I 
<br>
understand to be the problem. Also I may well have missed some important 
<br>
points.
<br>
<p>How is such a problem solved? I don't really know. But certainly not by 
<br>
resorting to race as identifier of culprits.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
