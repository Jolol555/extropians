<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why give the impression that the few religious people kooky
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enough to actual want and even fewer that actual work toward a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theocratic state are behind this?  That would be to give a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nuts far, far too much credit and political credibility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Simple ignorance and general fear of the un-understood is a much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more believable explanation.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm not religion-bashing when I say that it is just a fact that 
<br>
traditional religious people have been at the forefront of the anti-cloning 
<br>
push. Leon R. Kass, for example, is quite upfront about his religious faith. 
<br>
We know that Kass has influence with Dubya, who's commissioned his advice. 
<br>
Hey, we've seen the Pope himself getting in Dubya's ear about stem cell 
<br>
research in the past few days.
<br>
<p>In the Martha Nussbaum/Cass Sunstein collection, _Clones and Clones_, 
<br>
Richard Dawkins describes his experience of being forced to debate bishops 
<br>
etc about this issue again and again in Britain.
<br>
<p>If you go to the site of the Australian parliamentary committee that is 
<br>
currently looking at the legal response to cloning (though a crude 
<br>
anti-cloning provision has already been passed here), you'll see that it 
<br>
lists all the public submissions that were received. Many of these are 
<br>
available to read, including all the longer ones. There are huge, thoroughly 
<br>
researched philosophical analyses from well-serviced religious think tanks 
<br>
such as the Australian Catholic bishops and others. These documents are 
<br>
strongly anti-cloning (whether it be reproductive cloning or therapeutic 
<br>
cloning). I suggest you download and read them to see what we're all up 
<br>
against. The experience will be the same in other countries - on a much 
<br>
greater scale, I'd suggest, in the US.
<br>
<p>I've been following this very closely and the evidence is just overwhelming 
<br>
that the main intellectual dynamo of anti-cloning ideas is the Catholic 
<br>
Church, but also other churches and people associated with them. It's 
<br>
approximately the same people who are anti-abortion and anti-gay.
<br>
<p>Samantha, you've just got to read the literature, follow the debate, see the 
<br>
key players, to observe the crucial role of religious leaders and thinkers.
<br>
<p>That doesn't mean that *all* people with religious beliefs are anti-cloning 
<br>
or that there are not others who are also culpable. Some science fiction 
<br>
writers, sensationalist journalists, anti-science secular intellectuals of 
<br>
various kinds etc also have a lot to answer for. But I think it makes good 
<br>
sense to view the draconian laws being proposed at the moment in liberal 
<br>
democracies such as the US and Australia as essentially theocratic 
<br>
legislation.
<br>
<p>In religious communities, the view you describe as &quot;kooky&quot; is actually 
<br>
mainstream. Those of us who are not opposed to therapeutic cloning are 
<br>
considered the kooky ones. Those of us who are opposed to criminal 
<br>
prohibitions on reproductive cloning and would consider it an ethically 
<br>
acceptable practice if it could be developed to a point of being safe are 
<br>
even kookier, in their eyes.
<br>
<p>I don't want to go through life considering every religious person to be an 
<br>
enemy. In fact, as you know, that isn't how I think. But we have to face the 
<br>
fact that we're seeing the beginning of a holy war on transhumanist values, 
<br>
ideas and aspirations. Kass called for this pretty damn explicitly in his 
<br>
latest article in _The New Republic_ (I posted the URL for this a few weeks 
<br>
back so you can check for yourself how far I may be exaggerating).
<br>
<p>If you, Samantha, or anyone else here could find ways to communicate with 
<br>
people who have religious beliefs/spiritual yearnings and maybe break down 
<br>
the sense of unanimity among them, that would be wonderful. Please, by all 
<br>
means, do whatever you can.
<br>
<p>But I think it's wishful thinking if you don't accept that ideas which are 
<br>
inimical to our aspirations are the mainstream approach in religious 
<br>
communities and organisations. Moreover, these ideas have enormous 
<br>
influence, including with politicians.
<br>
<p>If we have to fight these people head-on in the short or medium term, we'll 
<br>
lose. Unlike J.R., I don't think it's a priority to debunk religiosity 
<br>
(though I'm happy to do a bit of this around the edges, I admit). If we have 
<br>
to do *that* to make our case, we're already dead (to use an appropriate way 
<br>
of speaking). Religion is just too popular (we could go into the reasons for 
<br>
this, but that's not immediately relevant).
<br>
<p>I think we have to put forward strong arguments for the liberal ideal of 
<br>
society in which freedom is paramount and nothing gets banned because of a 
<br>
manufactured consensus on moral or theological ideas. If we can win, or even 
<br>
hold our own, in *that* debate, it's sufficient. We have to speak up in 
<br>
every forum that will give us a voice.
<br>
<p>We don't need to convert the masses to transhumanism. I'll take my chances 
<br>
of getting the high-tech society I want if the liberal framework is there 
<br>
for people to make their own decisions.
<br>
<p>Enough.
<br>
<p>Live *free*!
<br>
<p>Russell
