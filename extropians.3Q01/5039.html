</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I could be wrong.
</em><br>
<p>You mean that the imported mexican labor benefits the personal ecomomies of 
<br>
the persons who pay to have cow shit shoveled in America, and it hurts the 
<br>
personal economies of those American citizens who have the right to work 
<br>
here--whose ancestors built this country, helped this country claw its way 
<br>
up from predominant peasantry--and would like to shovel cow shit if the 
<br>
price were worthwhile. Of course, there are two sides to every story, but 
<br>
that side is being ignored.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I had the misfortune of being born fifteen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;miles on the wrong side of the US/Canada border.
</em><br>
<p><p>I had the misfortune of not being born filthy rich, etc....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;As the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;COO of Kryos Biomedical and the Operations Officer etc. of Extropy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Institute, I am most certainly not taking jobs away from Americans; one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the jobs was essentially not able to be filled by any American, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other required a keen interest in an obscure area.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Divorced from my obvious personal bias, I think it is a dangerous game to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;close the border(s) (which you may not be proposing), and it breeds both
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cultural arrogance (&quot;We can do it ourselves...we don't need those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*outsiders*&quot;) and xenophobia.  To me, neither of those traits seem very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;favorable.
</em><br>
<p>At my workplace, when we want to hire someone to do a job, we look at their 
<br>
resumes. Some resumes I see are interesting--I think to myself, &quot;Hey, this 
<br>
person could help us out, etc.&quot;.  When I look at a mexican peasant's resume, 
<br>
I don't find much to interest me. They may have strong backs, but there are 
<br>
already citizens living here with strong backs. You, however, are an 
<br>
entirely different matter....
