---&gt; L B, quoting Russell Blackford (and others, I think)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The fact that so many journos and other writers find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any view other than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; above almost inconceivable suggests that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probably common in the wider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; community.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could it be that, because these authors and writers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speak in this manner (which seems to coincide with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most religious, nationalistic, and some pop-sci
</em><br>
<em>&gt; views),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that public opinion is so easily swayed by this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of backhanded advertising, that the source is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the publishing industry? If the newspaper is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right-wing, like the Denver Post used to be (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably still is, I don't read the paper anymore),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever controlling entities would likely not allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antiaging articles unless they were againt it.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely -- it's a feedback loop. Which is why positive media coverage of
<br>
any pro-life extension, pro-technology group is so important. We have to
<br>
insert outselves into that loop, employ a little media judo and use the
<br>
existing flows of information around out culture to our benefit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I think a lot of work needs to be done, getting out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the viewpoint that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; radical life extension would be a good thing - the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same sort of work as many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of us are putting into defending stem cell research,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; therapeutic cloning etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And several people have pointed out what we have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fight--entrenched religions (domineering, patriarchal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and violent), entrenched pop-sci stuff that says we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are wasting money and should put it toward researching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new ways to keep our suburban grass from growing so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast so we don't have to cut it as often, and mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; media that has enough power to determine our next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would fight it all if I knew how. If we can figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it out, you've got my pledge to help.
</em><br>
<p>None of the methodologies are rocket science, nothing new. It's all been
<br>
done before, being done now. AIDS research advocacy, antibiotech, pro- and
<br>
anti-nuclear power groups, LEF, etc, etc.
<br>
<p>Form a non-profit to act as coordinating center for spawning grassroots
<br>
groups that are on-topic, acquire directors and supporters with media
<br>
knowledge, nonprofit experience and name recognition, and set off on the
<br>
years-long route of making yourself heard. It goes faster than it used to
<br>
now that we have an Internet.
<br>
<p>A lot of work does need to be done. That the PAC is forming for technology
<br>
advocacy is good. That I'm creating the Longevity Meme for a certain type of
<br>
life-extension advocacy is good. But this is all at the stage of defining
<br>
goals and setting the foundation stones.
<br>
<p>So, for the sake of argument, here's my plan:
<br>
<p>1) get the non-profit paperwork going (with the subnote that I really hate
<br>
the way California organizes this) to the point where the organization can
<br>
purchase, accept money and put its name on things.
<br>
<p>2) hack together a website with the basics: methods to donate money,
<br>
statements of purpose, section for linking to interesting news and articles,
<br>
robust bulletin boards, announcement. Not very hard if you know what you're
<br>
doing and are willing to thrown $500 in setup costs, a month of your time,
<br>
3% of all donations, and $100/yr at the problem.
<br>
<p>3) build an online community centered around the bulletin boards. I won't
<br>
bore the list with all I've learned over the past couple of years about
<br>
building online communities -- it's 50% common sense, 20% technical stuff
<br>
and 30% things you pick up.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) the community has to have a clearly defined purpose from the get-go
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) you need two to three charismatic and dedicated moderators/leaders
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) a continual influx of new topics for discussion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) sources of new recruits and places to advertise the community
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) technical reliability
<br>
<p>4) the purpose of the online communities is initially steered towards
<br>
consciousness-raising activities with a bias towards those that have worked
<br>
for AIDS activism groups; things that:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) leave useful records and HOW-TOs behind so that they can be repeated
<br>
elsewhere with minimal setup
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) that anyone can contribute to with time rather than money
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) that give the contributers the feeling of accomplishment
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) that are aimed at the general public rather than the choir
<br>
<p>Examples include things such as pamphlet distributions, the ever-popular
<br>
petitioners on subways (a Berkeley thing -- there seems to be an entire
<br>
subculture of little old lady advocates-for-hire who dwell in BART
<br>
stations), online petitions of support, etc, etc.
<br>
<p>5) later, the online community should serve as a resource and spawning
<br>
ground for local grassroots activism chapters.
<br>
<p>6) the metric of success is the number and type of articles your activities
<br>
generate in the mainstream media.
<br>
<p>7) once underway and I have something to show for my efforts, I approach the
<br>
&quot;names&quot; in the life extension circuit for directorship positions in the
<br>
non-profit. People like the existing Directors of LEF or the Extropy
<br>
Institute, scientists who work hard in the field, experienced non-profit
<br>
directors, etc.
<br>
<p>8) With directors in place, then we start on a more serious fundraising
<br>
effort that will lead to enough money to be tacking low-tier paid
<br>
advertising. Stuff like bus posters, local radio, etc, etc.
<br>
<p>9) At this point -- or perhaps earlier -- constructive relationships can be
<br>
set up with other non-profits and perhaps some for-profit concerns. But this
<br>
is all out a year at least.
<br>
<p>I guess I should note that I don't want to anything political until I have
<br>
an established community; and political and legislative activism would get
<br>
it's own umbrella organization. It's a whole different ballgame, and
<br>
requires more lawyers.
<br>
<p>So -- what can people do to help?
<br>
<p>1) donate content: permission to post properly accredited essays/articles on
<br>
the necessity of life extension on the web site (as opposed to linking to
<br>
them). This is an implicit endorsement thing.
<br>
<p>2) find me a friendly, helpful life-extensionist California lawyer who knows
<br>
non-profit law and is willing to put the time in for free; or at least
<br>
listen to my plans to see if (s)he thinks I'm on the ball. Given that I
<br>
don't know one, and no-one I know knows one, this would be a step up from
<br>
talking to the non-profit associations for legal advice.
<br>
<p>3) assist on the technical side -- site building, etc.
<br>
<p>4) participate in the community! A strong, vocal, dedicated initial nucleus
<br>
is essential.
<br>
<p>5) be cheerleaders; advocate, get your friends to visit the site, tell
<br>
everyone you know.
<br>
<p>After all -- your lives get extended too!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't know whether this list can really coordinate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such work. I doubt it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But &quot;the list&quot; is not all there is--there are others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who have not gotten into a good search engine and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looked for &quot;antiaging research&quot; or &quot;Procaine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hydrochloride&quot; or whatever. It's how I found you all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are others who want to live, I know it, and want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to step beyond the supposed everlasting life of a god
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that appears to love gold and money more than he loves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us. Maybe these peole have given up, I don't know.
</em><br>
<p>Mailing lists are, in general, a bad way to coordinate more than one
<br>
dedicated topic at a time. Mailing lists have ADD -- topics vanish from the
<br>
collective memory about three posts after they happen. Bulletin boards are a
<br>
better community center for multiple simulataneous discussions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From my point of view, this list -- and other online watering holes like
</em><br>
it -- are a resource. You find people, propagate general ideas; it's all
<br>
about ideas and people.
