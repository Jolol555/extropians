<em>&gt; &gt; MAD will serve us well, until it fails.  We might have the UIM by then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but we might not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What I have not seen is some kind of timeline that shows the intermediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; steps that need to be accomplished before the UIM is born.

<p>No.  Is there a way?  Sure hope so.  Recognizing the fact that we
<br>
are apes with dangerous reptilian brain functions does not show
<br>
us how to overcome those reptilian tendencies.  Humans were
<br>
born to fight.  {8-[   Im hoping the AI will figure out how to save
<br>
us from us.

<p><em>&gt; &gt; Any major

<em>&gt; Maybe this will help, Spike:

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sam N. Lehman Wilzeg, &quot;Frankenstein Unbound: Towards a Legal Definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Artifical Intelligence,&quot; Futures (December 1981), pp. 442-457
</em><br>
<p>Cool, thanks for the references JR!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By any definition the present powers of AI machines are both impressive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worrisome.  Cyberneticists have already created or proven that AI constructs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can do the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (3)  Learn from their own mistakes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --N. Wiener, God and Golem, Inc (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1966)
</em><br>
<p>In a very limited sense, this was accomplished before 1966.  One
<br>
of the early chess programs was set up to play without knowledge
<br>
of chess other than how the pieces move, and to develop its own
<br>
notions of the relative values of its pieces.  It eventually began to
<br>
converge on a reasonable values before the experimenters decided
<br>
to quit spending precious computer time on it.  One of these days
<br>
I want to find that research and see if the experiment has been repeated
<br>
now that computer time is cheap.  That might make for a cool parallel
<br>
computing project.
<br>
<p>Actually Im not sure if that fits the definition of learning from its
<br>
mistakes, exactly.  spike
