&lt;&lt;Just out of curiosity, I'm wondering how many on this list feel they came up with the idea of the singularity on their own. I feel like I did, and was surprised to find an organization based, in large part, on the concept.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I am more then a little embarassed about this (and probably should be) but I have, in the Shermer sense of believing &quot;weird things&quot;, have long suspected that there are/is a mechanism in the universe, for storing all information. Call it a backup or a system-save or whatever, but I supected it. Basically, I am still, looking for all facets of this (perhaps nonsensical) idea. Or as Thoreau once said: &quot;Build your castles in the air, then put a foundation under it.&quot; Which is what I seem to be devoted to. Call it a process on the way to Singularity.
