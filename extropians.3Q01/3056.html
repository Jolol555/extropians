<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thank goodness extropians only consider 2/3's of [these notions]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list to be appropriate targets.
</em><br>
<p>and to Eric Chen Yixiong, Joe Dees writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh my.  The extropians are not gonna like you.  They are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to call you a troll and a socialist.
</em><br>
<p>Each remark contains a strong note of complaint.  In the
<br>
first, Michael Wiik seems to be implying that pointed criticism
<br>
of ideas is somehow inappropriate.  Or is Michael referring to
<br>
ad hominem attacks?  If so, would he kindly produce examples?
<br>
<p>And Joe Dees believes that soon Eric will be accused of being
<br>
a troll.  This is completely incorrect, if not paranoid.  Very
<br>
few people are accused of being trolls, and none are who provide
<br>
reasoned discourse (such as Eric is doing).
<br>
<p>And what the devil is this &quot;accuse&quot; you of being a &quot;socialist&quot;?
<br>
That's making it sound as though being a socialist or having
<br>
some socialist beliefs is a necessarily reprehensible view, or
<br>
as though criticisms of those with socialist beliefs were 
<br>
devoid of real substance (but consisted only name-calling).
<br>
<p>No one should expect to voice any view that is not subject to
<br>
criticism, and to sometimes powerful, convincing, and yes,
<br>
embarrassingly accurate criticism.  It's the price that should
<br>
be gladly paid in the free exchange of ideas.
<br>
<p>Russell Blackford writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am uncomfortable about list rules. I think anyone should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be free to say pretty much what they like.
</em><br>
<p>Hear! Hear!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If someone becomes too annoying, he or she will simply get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universally plonked.
</em><br>
<p>Well, no.  But that person should expect that fewer and fewer
<br>
of his or her posts will actually be read.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Moreover, if offensive material is being posted the answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is surely to reply with more speech, not to impose censorship.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely!
