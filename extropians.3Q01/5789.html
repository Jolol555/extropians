<em>&gt; I think it's safe to say Hawking is no dummy.  I'd think twice before

</em><br>
<em>&gt; aside, from the short blurb on the site it does not appear that he wants to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; augment human learning in the hope of keeping up with the pace AI learning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rather, it seems to me, that what he is proposing is some sort of symbiosis

</em><br>
<p>Yes.  That is what I got out of it most strongly also.  I didn't
<br>
get much of a suggestion that [natural] changes of the genome
<br>
would be of much primary help.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Silicon, for all its good properties, does have some drawbacks.  When a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer crashes, all is lost unless there has been a recent save to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;non-volitile&quot; memory.  Our memories are a seemless integration between RAM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ROM.  Not to mention the built-in multiple redundant redundancies which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let you keep going even after something so disruptive as a stroke.  Although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these advantages will increasingly be replicated in computers and, at some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point, I imagine that the only thing the bio-brain would add to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; synth-brain would be slowness.  At that point we pathetic meat-puppets had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better cross over and abandon the bio-brain, or get seriously left behind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>At some point, sure.  But between here and there we need to get
<br>
a whole lot smarter just as fast as we can if there is going to
<br>
be any &quot;there&quot; at all much less one we are part of.  I don't
<br>
agree we are &quot;pathetic&quot;.  We are the best we have for now and we
<br>
need to make the most of what we have on our way toward,
<br>
hopefully, better.
