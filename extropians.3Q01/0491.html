<p>Actually I think you are right Harvey.  I rethought this and remembered
<br>
being motivated back in high school to learn programming in order to mess
<br>
around with mathematical functions, kind of as a hobby.  In that sense
<br>
Im still doing that to this day.  When our high school was given a number
<br>
of semi-functional Apple IIs, we had almost no software, no word
<br>
processors, no spreadsheets, but all the machines had good old
<br>
Applesoft Basic.  We used them to generate large prime numbers,
<br>
find arithmetic sequences of primes, do monte carlo solutions to
<br>
problems, that kinda stuff.
<br>
<p>Ja we had a ball with that, but I didnt entertain the notion at the
<br>
time that we could make a living at it.  Then when the programmable
<br>
calculators came along shortly afterwards, we were constantly
<br>
messing around with those too, just to play.  Its the boring stuff like
<br>
Fortran coding that one makes a living at.  Actually Ive had a lot
<br>
of fun with that too.
<br>
<p>The original poster who was complaining about THE MAN stealing
<br>
his life away in a 9 to 5 needs to seriously look around and find a better
<br>
9 to 5.  spike
