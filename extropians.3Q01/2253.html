</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;violation of 'equal protection'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you're a damn humanizt :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's your definition of 'individual'? Does it include:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -living human being? (or do you have a better definition)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -modified human being? (e.g. brain-dead person)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -human in biostasis?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -uploaded person?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -artificial being?
</em><br>
<p>These are all fine with me, though I'm not sure if a person in biostasis
<br>
should be able to exert their franchise while taking time out from
<br>
reality. It's a valid point to debate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not recognize any entity with individualistic traits and aims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as an individual? Corporations may consist of human members but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thats irrelevant. They are all replacable. (I start to sound like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a borg drone. However, thats irrelevant.)
</em><br>
<p>That is entirely relevant, sorry, seven. Any individual belonging to a
<br>
corporation that has human status thus exerts more than one vote in the
<br>
polity. I.E. if there are ten partners in an enterprise ruled by
<br>
majority rule of partners, then each partner exerts 1.16 votes upon the
<br>
greater polity if the enterprise itself exerts one vote in the polity.
<br>
Similarly with campaign contributions, if you believe in their
<br>
limitation, putting, say, a $1000 limit on individual and corporate
<br>
donations allows partners in the above enterprise to donate $1,160 to a
<br>
campaign where an individual not in such an enteprise can only donate
<br>
$1,000. Again, this is a violation of equal protection.
<br>
<p>The proper way to impliment individual rights in a group entity is to
<br>
demand either that the individuals in the group delegate either all, or
<br>
a proportionate fraction of their power to the group, which the group
<br>
can then exercise in the polity as it wishes, determined by its own
<br>
internal operating rules. Thus, the corporation gets to vote in place of
<br>
all shareholder/employees, or you'd need to delegate a fraction of a
<br>
vote (not sure if this is possible politically, but numerically it could
<br>
be done) to the corporation.
