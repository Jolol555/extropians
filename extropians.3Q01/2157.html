<em>&gt; This idea was proposed by Princeton graduate student Hugh Everett III in 1957. 
</em><br>
<p>Everett III proposed a different idea: the Relative State Interpretation (RSI).
<br>
As far as I know the MWI says that, during a quantum measurement, 
<br>
the quantum chain (particle + pointer + reader) splits up (in many parts,
<br>
many worlds, even many minds - MMI). The whole effect is, of course, nonlocal. 
<br>
And according to Deutsch...... 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Quantum theory leaves no doubt that other universes exist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in exactly the same sense that the single Universe that we see exists,&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he says. &quot;This is not a matter of interpretation. It is a logical consequence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of quantum theory.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The RSI says that the quantum chain splits up, during the quantum 
<br>
measurement, but each part (world) comes with some *probability* attached. 
<br>
So the RSI is compatible with the Decoherence Interpretation (by Zeh,
<br>
and Zurek, et al.), which forbids the reality of many worlds.
<br>
Deutsch seems to be aware of these problems when he says that ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Free will might have a sensible definition, Deutsch thinks, because the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternatives don't have to occur within equally large slices of the multiverse. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;By making good choices, doing the right thing, we thicken the stack of universes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which versions of us live reasonable lives,&quot; he says. &quot;When you succeed, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the copies of you who made the same decision succeed too. What you do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the better increases the portion of the multiverse where good things happen.&quot;

The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: Many Worlds or Many Words?
<br>
Max Tegmark (IAS)
<br>
Journal-ref: Fortsch.Phys. 46 (1998) 855-862
<br>
As cutting-edge experiments display ever more extreme forms of non-classical behavior, 
<br>
the prevailing view on the interpretation of quantum mechanics appears to be gradually 
<br>
changing. A (highly unscientific) poll taken at the 1997 UMBC quantum mechanics 
<br>
workshop gave the once all-dominant Copenhagen interpretation less than half of the votes. 
<br>
The Many Worlds interpretation (MWI) scored second, comfortably ahead of the 
<br>
Consistent Histories and Bohm interpretations. It is argued that since all the above-mentioned 
<br>
approaches to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics give identical cookbook prescriptions for 
<br>
how to calculate things in practice, practical-minded experimentalists, who have traditionally 
<br>
adopted the ``shut-up-and-calculate interpretation'', typically show little interest in whether 
<br>
cozy classical concepts are in fact real in some untestable metaphysical sense or merely 
<br>
the way we subjectively perceive a mathematically simpler world where the Schrodinger 
<br>
equation describes everything - and that they are therefore becoming less bothered by 
<br>
a profusion of worlds than by a profusion of words. 
<br>
Common objections to the MWI are discussed. It is argued that when environment-induced 
<br>
decoherence is taken into account, the experimental predictions of the MWI are identical 
<br>
to those of the Copenhagen interpretation except for an experiment involving a Byzantine 
<br>
form of ``quantum suicide''. This makes the choice between them purely a matter of taste, 
<br>
roughly equivalent to whether one believes mathematical language or human language 
<br>
to be more fundamental.

Worlds in the Everett Interpretation
<br>
David Wallace
<br>
To appear in Studies in the History and Philosophy of Modern Physics
<br>
This is a discussion of how we can understand the world-view given to us by 
<br>
the Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics, and in particular the role played 
<br>
by the concept of `world'. The view presented is that we are entitled to use `many-worlds' 
<br>
terminology even if the theory does not specify the worlds in the formalism; this is defended 
<br>
by means of an extensive analogy with the concept of an `instant' or moment of time in relativity, 
<br>
with the lack of a preferred foliation of spacetime being compared with the lack of a preferred 
<br>
basis in quantum theory. Implications for identity of worlds over time, and for relativistic 
<br>
quantum mechanics, are discussed.

Against Many-Worlds Interpretations
<br>
Adrian Kent
<br>
Journal-ref: Int.J.Mod.Phys. A5 (1990) 1745
<br>
This is a critical review of the literature on many-worlds interpretations (MWI), 
<br>
with arguments drawn partly from earlier critiques by Bell and Stein. 
<br>
The essential postulates involved in various MWI are extracted, and their consistency 
<br>
with the evident physical world is examined. Arguments are presented against MWI 
<br>
proposed by Everett, Graham and DeWitt. The relevance of frequency operators to 
<br>
MWI is examined; it is argued that frequency operator theorems of Hartle and 
<br>
Farhi-Goldstone-Gutmann do not in themselves provide a probability interpretation 
<br>
for quantum mechanics, and thus neither support existing MWI nor would be useful 
<br>
in constructing new MWI. Comments are made on papers by Geroch and Deutsch 
<br>
that advocate MWI. It is concluded that no plausible set of axioms exists for an MWI 
<br>
that describes known physics.

Progress in a Many-Minds Interpretation of Quantum Theory
<br>
Matthew J. Donald
<br>
In a series of papers, a many-minds interpretation of quantum theory has been developed. 
<br>
The aim in these papers is to present an explicit mathematical formalism which constitutes 
<br>
a complete theory compatible with relativistic quantum field theory. In this paper, which could 
<br>
also serve as an introduction to the earlier papers, three issues are discussed. First, a significant, 
<br>
but fairly straightforward, revision in some of the technical details is proposed. This is used as an 
<br>
opportunity to introduce the formalism. Then the probabilistic structure of the theory is revised, 
<br>
and it is proposed that the experience of an individual observer can be modelled as the experience 
<br>
of observing a particular, identified, discrete stochastic process. Finally, it is argued that the formalism 
<br>
can be modified to give a physics in which no constants are required. Instead, `constants' have to be 
<br>
determined by observation, and are fixed only to the extent to which they have been observed.

On Many-Minds Interpretations of Quantum Theory
<br>
Matthew J. Donald
<br>
This paper is a response to some recent discussions of many-minds interpretations 
<br>
in the philosophical literature. After an introduction to the many-minds idea, the complexity 
<br>
of quantum states for macroscopic objects is stressed. Then it is proposed that a characterization 
<br>
of the physical structure of observers is a proper goal for physical theory. It is argued that an 
<br>
observer cannot be defined merely by the instantaneous structure of a brain, but that the history 
<br>
of the brain's functioning must also be taken into account. Next the nature of probability in many-minds 
<br>
interpretations is discussed and it is suggested that only discrete probability models are needed. 
<br>
The paper concludes with brief comments on issues of actuality and identity over time.

Does Quantum Nonlocality Exist? Bell's Theorem and the Many-Worlds Interpretation
<br>
Frank J. Tipler
<br>
Quantum nonlocality may be an artifact of the assumption that observers obey the laws 
<br>
of classical mechanics, while observed systems obey quantum mechanics. I show that, 
<br>
at least in the case of Bell's Theorem, locality is restored if observed and observer are both 
<br>
assumed to obey quantum mechanics, as in the Many-Worlds Interpretation. Using the MWI, 
<br>
I shall show that the apparently &quot;non-local&quot; expectation value for the product of the spins of two 
<br>
widely separated particles --- the &quot;quantum&quot; part of Bell's Theorem --- is really due to a series 
<br>
of three purely local measurements. Thus, experiments confirming &quot;nonlocality&quot; are actually 
<br>
confirming the MWI.

Observational Consequences of Many-Worlds Quantum Theory
<br>
Don N. Page (CIAR Cosmology Program, University of Alberta)
<br>
Messages from Jerry Finkelstein and Jacques Mallah have led me to realize that, 
<br>
although I stand by my prediction that in a many-worlds theory you will be alive in the 
<br>
year 2100 in some worlds, paradoxically the evidence you will have then will not 
<br>
support many-worlds quantum theory over single-history quantum theory, since 
<br>
in either theory it will be evidence of very low measure and likelihood for a random 
<br>
observation. Therefore, I deleted this part of the paper (and shortened other parts)
<br>
Contrary to an oft-made claim, there can be observational distinctions (say for the 
<br>
expansion of the universe or the cosmological constant) between &quot;single-history&quot; 
<br>
quantum theories and &quot;many-worlds&quot; quantum theories. The distinctions occur when 
<br>
the number of observers is not uniquely predicted by the theory. In single-history theories, 
<br>
each history is weighted simply by its quantum-mechanical probability, but in many-worlds 
<br>
theories in which random observations are considered, there should also be the weighting 
<br>
by the numbers or amounts of observations occurring in each history.
