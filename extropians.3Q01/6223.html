<em>&gt; Questions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - If they only had knives, why didn't multiple passengers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;rush&quot; the terrorists?
</em><br>
<p><p>Because there is a (statistically correct) assumption that most hijacking
<br>
won't end with the passengers being harmed.  Given a lack of precedent, the
<br>
people onboard probably did what they thought would be best for their
<br>
safety.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; - Now that we have seen what can happen -- will a plane full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Americans allow it to happen again?
</em><br>
<p><p>I was talking to some friends about this.  I expect that the next vanilla
<br>
hijacking may end up with the hijacker severely beaten or dead, even if he
<br>
just wants a free trip to Cuba.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; - Skyscrapers are constructed to withstand plane impacts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can they be constructed to withstand a plane full of fuel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; setting them on fire?
</em><br>
<p><p>Skyscrapers are designed with fire containment in mind, but the damage was
<br>
of so massive that it breached the containment mechanisms in ways that may
<br>
not have been anticipated.  You *could* partially fix the problem with
<br>
materials that are more fire resistant (i.e. alloys other than steel), but
<br>
that would be very expensive.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; - Why didn't the Pentagon (or less likely, the World Trade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Center buildings) have individuals on the roofs equipped with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surface-to-air missles?  Given what these disasters will cost,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would have been a small additional security expense.
</em><br>
<p><p>They do have surface-to-air missile defenses on some key buildings in the
<br>
Capital area, but they are of the portable kind, and would be entirely
<br>
useless on something as large as the jets in question.  Large format
<br>
surface-to-air defenses would work, but there is the problem of recognizing
<br>
a threat.  You don't want to be responsible for shooting down a plane that
<br>
was merely having problems; any active defensive posture could only really
<br>
come after the initial attack.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; - Where was the flight that crashed in Pennsylvania headed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've heard speculations of the USX building, Camp David
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the Pentagon.
</em><br>
<p><p>White house was a serious speculation.  It did look like there was some last
<br>
minute decisions on target selection in the capital mall.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Doesn't look like anybody has attempted looking at solutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking at other terrorist acts.  How do you stop a &quot;go fast&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boat headed for Miami with a nuclear or bioweapon?
</em><br>
<p><p>It boils down to setting hard boundaries and rules that are enforced with a
<br>
&quot;no-questions-asked&quot; lethal force.  This may make things more difficult for
<br>
terrorists (and seriously tighten up border security), but it will also mean
<br>
that innocents will in all likelihood be inadvertently killed on a
<br>
semi-regular basis.
