The one plane that apparently was heading for Camp David never made it.
<br>
There have been rumors that it was shot down before it could make it. 
<br>
Not that I expect the truth of something like this to ever come out. The
<br>
idea of Americans shooting down an American plane heading for the WTC might
<br>
be accepted by the American public. Shooting down an airliner that was
<br>
headed for some woods would never be acceptable under any circumstance I
<br>
could think of.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; has elected more libertarian state legistlators (25) in the last ten
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; years than any other.&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;   I have to say Alaska would be the best bet.  620,000 population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Not sure whether that includes military personnell.  You'd have to be

<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;   It's arguably the best state to go it alone, geographically isolated,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; plentiful rescources, not sharing a common border with the states is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; helpful.  But maybe the most important part is only Hawaii has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; better legitimate legal justification for seccession.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;   Bringing about a statewide referendum on the &quot;4 choices&quot; wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; be nearly as difficult to pull off as trying to get a plurality in Wyoming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; To say nothing of trying to run an independant country out of New
