<em>&gt; A small question occurs here:  Is there any reason to believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the computer ballot counting (where used) isn't &quot;fixed&quot;?  Historic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precedents would lead me to expect that it would be (even though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually the party in power can fudge enough things legally that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't necessary).
</em><br>
<p>Exit polls done by the media seem to match the actual computer counts in
<br>
most cases.  This is how the Palm Beach county problems were detected.  The
<br>
polling numbers from the people didn't match the counts coming out of the
<br>
computers.
<br>
<p>I don't know of any deliberate &quot;fixes&quot; in computers, but there are plenty of
<br>
errors.  One county's computers was caught giving negative votes.  One
<br>
county's computer counted all the votes for one candidate.  One county's
<br>
computer counted a straight Republican or Democratic ticket based on the
<br>
presidential vote, and didn't really look at the other votes.  This and
<br>
other problems were all attributed to &quot;bugs&quot;.   These seem to be caught
<br>
because the results don't add up or make sense.
<br>
<p>The closest thing to a &quot;fix&quot; is the fact that voting machines that fail to
<br>
register enough votes are retired in richer counties that can afford to buy
<br>
new ones, and are shipped to poorer counties that can't afford new machines.
<br>
As such, the vote count in poorer counties is known to be less of their
<br>
total than the vote count in richer counties.
