<p>If any pattern is apparent, it is that societies that have just
<br>
emerged from revolution appear, unsurprisingly, to have more
<br>
latitude in extending rights to subgroups.  The older and more
<br>
established the country, the longer it took in general.  (Compare
<br>
the U.K. with Australia, for instance.)  Also, countries in the
<br>
bottom half of the list were generally slow to democratize.

<p>A nearly complete list is at

<em>&gt; Switzerland, 1971
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Syria, 1971
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Liechtenstein, 1976
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so much for the small population theory
</em><br>
<p>But on the other hand, given that everything else is
<br>
equal, it makes sense that a democratic larger nation
<br>
is going to accede to a revolutionary change more slowly
<br>
than a small country:  there are probably more factions,
<br>
and (as in the U.S.) more states or provinces.  The first
<br>
URL above described how the woman suffrage movement got
<br>
its start in the U.S., and how Wyoming was the first
<br>
state (in 1869).  But that makes sense too:  Wyoming
<br>
was a very new state, much less encumbered by tradition
<br>
and by size.
