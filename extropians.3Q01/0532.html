<p>HOly schlaMOLY, Lee, I have treated you with
<br>
insufficient respect!  My apologies, master!  Crimony
<br>
2280!  I play well enough to indicate a seriously
<br>
misspent youth, but not THAT misspent.  I topped
<br>
out in the very low expert range, or really high A-ish.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or maybe it shows that my interests drifted, I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not sure.  Are you able to play much?
</em><br>
<p>I gave it up too, about 8 yrs ago.  Too much going
<br>
on in my life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Ever go to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chess clubs (there is a great Campbell club in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; area)?
</em><br>
<p>I think the one you are talking about is the invitation-
<br>
only club?  I got invites twice.  First time I was having
<br>
a so-so night and got my butt kicked several times.  Second
<br>
time I was sooooo ON, very hot that night, played a
<br>
FIDE master twice, 25ers, drew both times, then I
<br>
was quite SURE my mother was calling, so I left on
<br>
that note.  Quickly.  He was either having a bad night
<br>
or really wasnt trying.  {8^D
<br>
<p>Craig Mar was there, and of course everyone was
<br>
treating him like a god.  Like Mar, I could have easily
<br>
become a philosophy/chess/mathematics bum, and perhaps
<br>
I would have been happier.  But the society which had
<br>
the burden of supporting my habit would be less happy.
<br>
<p>Sahsa Chislenko was interested in chess.  We were going
<br>
to rattle off some 5ers at Extro4, but Shelly had the 4-wheeler,
<br>
so I had to take the bike, so I didnt have my board, and it
<br>
never happened, to my eternal regret.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Did you get any games in at Extro-5?
</em><br>
<p>Even more than E4, Extro5 went by in a hyperactive
<br>
blur.  I have never been so cheerfully exhausted as I was the
<br>
Tuesday after.  By extrapolation, I suspect that the
<br>
extro conferences will never be a good place to play
<br>
chess, discuss mathematics or anything of the sort.
<br>
There is just too much going on, too many fascinating
<br>
conversations going on, too many fun people gathered
<br>
in one spot.  Let us not assume a chess match at any
<br>
future extropian gathering.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (I couldn't make it :-( )  Lee
</em><br>
<p>I pity you.  It was one hellll of a good time, and I heard
<br>
enough ideas there to keep me busy for months to come.
<br>
It would have been worth it just to sit quietly and listen
<br>
to Anders Sandberg and Eliezer debate the singularity.
<br>
Even more than the extrolist, the extropian gatherings
<br>
are the ultimate idea-firehose.  Dont miss the next one.  spike
