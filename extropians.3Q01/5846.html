COTS.

<p>You're arguing from the position of the year 2001. Currently, you're
<br>
right, the best ROI is COTS, and will continue to be that for quite a long
<br>
time. As much as another decade, maybe. However, the difference between
<br>
Moore's law and real world performance is starting to gap perceptibly, and
<br>
there's some trend towards diversification, or rather, specialization. So,
<br>
we will have to have special-purpose hardware, ere the noughties will have
<br>
grown very old.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Since at the most recent Linux World conf. I saw a plug-in

<br>
but checkpointing. Hard disks will die, soon.
<br>

<p><em>&gt; a ethernet, and run as a Beowulf complex.  You could, in

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the market today.  I feel relatively certain that when the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Beowulfs are nice, but the hardware price becomes irrelevant at about 10 k
<br>
nodes, where other factors start to dominate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, it would be a bit expensive... at today's prices.  To take
</em><br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; you fill this way.  That's $2000 + 4 * $700 ~ $5,000.  Now this isn't
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's a good starter system.  And the OS for this would be Linux.  I
</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>Windows is a truly lousy OS for a Beowulf, for multiple reasons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; probably about double the cost.  Or more.  And for a better system one
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Sure, but I thought we were talking AI, not Beowulfery.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, today's too early to start buying the hardware.  Moore's law

<p>Not if you want to get something done, today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; says do as much as is feasible before buying the hardware.  If I had

<p>Moore's law is about integration density, not performance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; gotten far enough, I'd spring for the basic Tower ($5,000).  That
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Thread? ???
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By the time I was ready to proceed, hareware will probably have
</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>Yes, there is, if you want to port your code to a 1e6 node machine.
<br>
Because Linux won't run on that, for obvious reasons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; would probably become sophisticated enough to swallow the OS, so one

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>You're very fond of numbers. I used to do that, too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I project this year's trends forwards (cpu speeds doubled,
</em><br>

<p>CPU speed growth over time is no longer a linear log plot. And memory

<p><em>&gt; able to get a 5X5 that was 4 times as powerful for around

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>SMP does lousy on memory starved code. And AI is most assuredly that.
<br>
Properly done AI is embararssingly parallel, so scaling up cheap nodes
<br>
with good interconnect is your best bet. Currently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; mix, but generally you're doing quite well if you get a 50%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bonus by adding the second one.  So you gain quite a lot more by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using faster CPUs than by using more of them.)
</em><br>
<p>Your memory bandwidth is still screwed, so fuck that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And do remember that an AI won't need to be as busy at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; autonomic tasks as we are.  I've seen an estimate that 80% of
</em><br>
<p>Can't parse this. Autonomic tasks?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; our brain is devoted to tasks like maintaining muscle tension,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processing food, monitoring sugar levels, etc.  I don't know how
</em><br>
<p>You assume the AI won't have sensomotorics???
<br>
<p><em>&gt; reliable the estimate was, but current hardware doesn't need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much of that kind of effort.  So a much less computational
</em><br>
<p>The estimate is screwed, most is burnt to process vision. At least, if
<br>
we're talking about hardware between our ears.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; intensive AI would be needed to achieve the same results.  And there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also the question of how efficient our thought processes are.  I don't
</em><br>
<p>Judged from past estimate history (aka perpetuation of debacles), you must
<br>
assume they're about as efficient as it gets, plus some, and then twice
<br>
that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; know of any way to answer this, but there may be a lot of room for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvement.  In fact, we may have already designed a bunch of
</em><br>
<p>Improvement for what? You don't have to track single molecules in the
<br>
brain, that is more or less certain. But, you certainly have to account
<br>
for mentation-relevant processes occuring in an instance of a natural
<br>
nanocomputer, and this is anything but paltry stuff. You better believe
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>As I said, the space between your ears is very busy, and on a fraction of
<br>
the energy footprint of your desktop box. Do not underestimate this stuff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; improvements that just don't happen to work very easily with a neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; net.  (Symbolic logic, e.g.)  We can &quot;understand&quot; them, but they sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't native to us, so we &quot;run them under emulation&quot;.  That's always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slow!
</em><br>
<p>What makes you think AI is pure symbolic logic? If I need that, I can get
<br>
Mathematica, or Maple, or MuPad. It just kills me, but this is not natural
<br>
AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I don't see hardware as being the problem (though if it takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 125 node cluster to do the job, affording it might be).  But
</em><br>
<p>Hardware is not a problem, a 125 node Beowulf will do!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; notice that this scenario assumes that one is starting for here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and now.  And it requires an OS be present that can BE swallowed
</em><br>
<p>If you want to start here and now, Beowulf is the ticket. But, you're not
<br>
going to get any AI that way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; by the AI, without it being dismembered by lawyers.  And it
</em><br>
<p>Lawyers dismembering AI? Strange.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; requires that the OS be copyable, without the AI being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dismembered by lawyers.  Etc.  If you expect that the eventual
</em><br>
<p>Linux is free, and it performs nicely enough, but what has this to do with
<br>
a naturally inteligent system?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; software will be sold, then one of the BSD variations should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably be your starting platform, but that feels to me like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slavery.  It's one thing to ask it to earn its keep, but it's
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>I'm feeling like it's 1960, or something.
