<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The methodology that observing a person's

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why? If the statistics support it, then it is an entirely valid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; prediction to make, as much as a weather man predicts rain wherever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there are clouds....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know this is a hard point to grasp, but it is basic statistics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Statistical numbers only apply to large normalized groups.  They do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply to individuals or small groups.  A million coin flips will be 50%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heads and 50% tails.  We cannot pre-judge a single coin flip, or even a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coin flips.  The statistical numbers do not apply.  They cannot support any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumptions made about any individual.
</em><br>
<p>Wrong. If the statistics say that, say, 10% of blacks commit crime while
<br>
only 1% of whites do, then it is a reasonable assumption to say that any
<br>
individual black person is ten times more likely to commit crime than
<br>
any white person, all other factors being equal.
<br>
<p>Any given coin flip DOES have a 50-50 chance of being heads or tails.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your weather man predicts percentages of rain of an area based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistical averages for that area.  (Even then, weather reports are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that accurate!)  He does not predict for a particular house or person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether they will get rain.  He does not predict for a particular cloud
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether it will rain or not.
</em><br>
<p>Weather prediction is far more accurate the more you know about weather.
<br>
Saying that clouds don't cause rain and that its wrong to accuse them of
<br>
causing rain, AND wrong to conduct scientific research to find out what
<br>
DOES cause rain is itself wrong. Saying it is racist to conclude from
<br>
scientific study that clouds cause rain is wrong and simply politically
<br>
correct thinking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Applying group sampling statistics to the group being sampled is valid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Applying group sampling statistics to any individual is not valid.
</em><br>
<p>It is not valid to say what an individual WILL do, but it is valid to
<br>
say what they are LIKELY to do, all other factors being equal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any good reason to split hairs with these terms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; except to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to practice prejudice and discrimination while claiming not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be racist?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, there is. If you were following my essays on trust and political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enfranchisement here in the US, you'd recognize why. I most emphatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do NOT say that the probability of committing crime is genetic. To the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; contrary, it is part and parcel of the trust dynamic in society. Those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we trust least are more likely to breach trust. Part of it is a self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fulfilling prophesy of expectations about the behavior of those we trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; least, the rest is generally a self perpetuating attitude of resentment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in those who are poorly trusted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So how does this relate to race?  Are you saying that one race should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trusted more or less than another race?  If so, this is racist. 
</em><br>
<p>If that were what I was saying, then it would be racist. That is not
<br>
what I was saying, and I suggest you reread my posts on trust, that are
<br>
dated back to a week or two after Extro5.
