<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; For example, schools at all levels could entirely finance themselves and

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; contracted students received educations in exchange for a guaranteed

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; bureaucracy. ;...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Schools could easily contract with insurance companies to guarantee its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; graduates make their remittances, thus eliminating the need for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; government in the equation entirely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What a great idea!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hey, I've had an even niftier notion! Say *everyone who's ever been to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school* and is *already* earning money pays into a pool that's distributed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to *today's* schools, *now*! That way, instead of having to wait for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; graduates to find work sometime in the future and pay them then (those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manage to find a job, anyway), the schools would get funds immediately!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And to save on the excessive costs of all those different insurance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies, with their wasteful duplication of effort, how about paying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *into one big fund* that's overseen by representatives *chosen by all those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people paying in*!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, wait--
</em><br>
<p>Oh, wait -- is right. The bigger the fund, the more layers of wasteful
<br>
oversight are needed to make sure nobody is wasting or, heavens forfend,
<br>
*stealing* the money, the more that is wasted.
<br>
<p>Mikes simple solution: You apply to work at company A, or start a
<br>
business, company A, where you need references to give to potential
<br>
employers/lenders/investors to certify your ability to do what you said
<br>
you can do. One of these is your educational history, where you list the
<br>
schools you've attended, taken courses at, and/or graduated from. In
<br>
order to get them to admit to third parties that your reference of them
<br>
is accurate, you must sign a contract with the employer/lender/investor
<br>
and your educational institutions that $x or x% of your earnings will go
<br>
to those institutions, thus it is automatically deducted from your pay
<br>
and paid directly to your school. You could, theoretically, get an
<br>
employer/investor to pay off your debt to your school in one lump sum as
<br>
a condition of employment, etc. thus making them a stockholder in your
<br>
future earnings. Far more direct, far simpler, and no reason to give
<br>
thugs an excuse to stick a baton up your bumhole. Eliminate the
<br>
middleman.
