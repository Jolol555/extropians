<p>No problem John.  We cut you a lotta slack for the following reasons:
<br>
<p>1.  your dislexia was acting up
<br>
2.  you were under the influence of a 4-yr old
<br>
3.  you're a hell of a nice guy.
<br>
<p>Besides that, when you quoted Greg Burch saying he was part of
<br>
a Christians on Campus something or other, everybody knew
<br>
something was up bigtime.  {8^D
<br>
<p>Altho I didnt agree with the sentiments Samantha wrote and for
<br>
which I was credited, her comments were quite eloquently
<br>
expressed and did get me thinking, as did Amara's followup.
<br>
<p>There is a spiritual side to humans, which we have not yet
<br>
discovered how to model on the computer.  There is something
<br>
in that feeling of staring into the abyss which we do not yet
<br>
understand.  During my camping trip in the Sierras, I stared
<br>
into deep space and tried to imagine away the incomprehensible
<br>
distance between here and there.  It does something to the
<br>
mind which is difficult to reproduce consistently.  Traditional
<br>
religion does something for some people which we do not
<br>
understand currently, but perhaps someday we will.  Lets
<br>
live and let live, perhaps try to find common ground with
<br>
those who are spiritual if possible.  spike
