<em>&gt; This article, the assumption made by its author, and your response to

</em><br>
<p>Question-mark?
<br>
<p>What on earth are you going on about?
<br>
<p>Yes, I know that the media assume we all live to work. I am aware
<br>
that, with any luck, this whole issue will become academic within a
<br>
decade or so as assumptions about productivity being coupled to human
<br>
beings slide into obsolescence.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, this is *the* problem that has held *Japan* in recession 
<br>
throughout the 1990's. It may not have been the initial cause, but 
<br>
the demographics suggest that the increasing old age problem there
<br>
has exacerbated their current economic headaches. 
<br>
<p>The critical thing to note is the ratio of productive workers to non-
<br>
productive pensioners. Within the current paradigm, fewer workers and
<br>
more pensioners means either the need for more wealth distribution and
<br>
higher taxation ... or starving pensioners.
<br>
<p>This isn't about the future; this is about the here-and-now. And how
<br>
are we going to get to that wonderful technological singularity if 
<br>
our planetary economy goes into decline and stays there for the rest
<br>
of our lives?
