<em>&gt; VR would enable work to be done from home more. Using telepresence, even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factory equipment could be operated, reducing the need for travel even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further. That, of course depends on how expensive such equipment remains 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relative to the cost of human labor.
</em><br>
<p>In theory, yes.
<br>
<p>Let me give you an example: Right now I do attachment work from my Polytechnic. I do programming, and I bring my own computer there because of the inadequate facilities (especially software) there. I can easily do the job at my home, with better facilities (except the lack of air-conditioning).
<br>
<p>However, I have to &quot;work&quot; a 44 hour week, and travel there during the peak traffic hours where everyone also wanted to get to work. This also prevents me from working late at night where I can program better, and for me to take quick afternoon naps to maintain my alertness.
<br>
<p>I actually found this crazy enough for me to bring this issue up, of a compromise that I travel during less congested times. However, the lecturer in charge retorted: &quot;What's the problem with seeing my face more often?&quot;. I know that I have no choice but to go along with this craziness, if I want to get my diploma that my mother demands of me.
<br>
<p>I had not even scratched the surface of the injustices and inefficiency I face. Some choose not to take the road to efficiency, and I have no power to stop them.
<br>

<em>&gt; All very interesting stuff... and part of the reason why I want *so* much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to live to see the long-term future.
</em><br>
<p>The future, unfortuntely, proceeds at a snail's pace (to me), and may turn out very different from what we hope it will turn out.
