Joe Dees has kindly responded to my inquiring about the so-called
<br>
email bombing incident (I called it that).  I had asked that the
<br>
language be free of political partisanship, and there was really
<br>
only one *flagrant* violation, to wit, &quot;to the right of the NRA&quot;.
<br>
I hope that any replies omit further political polarization.
<br>
<p>Sadly, instead of just the facts, for which I asked, there were
<br>
a few totally unnecessary insults delivered, e.g., &quot;two-bit satraps&quot;.
<br>
Now I think that I'm getting the picture, thanks.  I'm not making any
<br>
judgments, and I believe that you were probably far from guiltless
<br>
yourself.  Please, let's not get into virulent or extended discussions
<br>
of this, if we can avoid it.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee

<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;I am very curious about an historical event in which Joe Dees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;was the alleged victim of an email campaign.  It has become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;unclear whether there was a &quot;campaign&quot; at all, or whether it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;was directed at his own personal email address (or a list to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;which he merely was subscribed), or to what degree people went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in order to suppress dissenting views.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(I myself would prefer that Mr. Joe Dees tell his story first,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;if he is so inclined, in non-partisan objective language.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;And, if I'm not being insulting towards anyone with these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;requests (for which I do apologize), I would be very happy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;if all accounts were free of political partisan content,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;i.e., that no observer would be capable of determining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;who was liberal or who was conservative, or whatever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Needless to say, insulting terms like &quot;droogies&quot; or whatever,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;should be omitted when it's just the facts that should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;foremost first.

<p><em>&gt; I received the emails because I was on the list; they were posted to the list, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but directed to me.  This travesty was meant to enforce a progun hegemony 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere to the right of the NRA on this list, by means of attack, insult, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intimidation, mischaracterization and outright lying.  They accused me of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanting to ban all guns for anyone, even though that was never my position,and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I own five of them myself, questioned my patriotism (I'm a military vet), as if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not sharing their views was an act of treason that should be punishable by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death, accused me of being a stalking horse for various gun-control groups even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though I have never been a member of one or knowingly corresponded with anyone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who was (not that there's anything wrong with that), and branded me the worst 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing they could dream up, a left-liberal socialist collectivist commie pinko 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (not all in one email, but those terms were used).  In fact, I'm a fiscal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative and social liberal.  The people who were engaged i!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; n !
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this attempt to silence/suppress me by means of a combination of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cyberbrowbeating and sheer volume, included, mainly, James Rogers, Lee Daniel 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Crocker and Brian Williams (although there were others), but was spearheaded by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michael Lorrey.  All people have to do is look in the archives for email from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these individuals and replies posted by me to them to substantiate that such a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sustained blitzkrieg occurred.  The funny thing about the whole debacle (funny 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as in self-contradictory) was witnessing self-labeled libertarians, who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ostensibly despise dictatorial, totalitarian, single-view, party-line, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforced-uniformity, no-tolerance-for-dissent/differing-views regimes, behaving 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like two-bit satraps by attempting to engage in the cyberequivalent of a pogram 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of memetic cleansing (Can anyone say 'true colors&quot;? I know you can).  In my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion, Sean Kenney's characterization was mild and over-kind.  And in A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CLOCKWORK ORANGE, the term 'droogies' meant friends who got together to perpe!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tr!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ate violence; therefore I do not consider it an unfair characterization.  I, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, refused to back down, roll over and be a willing victim - I'm just not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built that way.  When a moratorium was declard on the topic, the major 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perpetrators formed their own list, exi-freedom (free from dissenting views, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll wager).  Of course, far be it for these individuals to actually own up to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own past actions, even though there were many list witnesses to this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cyber-pile-on, and this message will most probably provoke them to, oblivious 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the blatant irony, deny them, even with archive evidence and as they attempt 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to repeat them.
