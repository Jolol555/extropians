</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Why? If the statistics support it, then it is an entirely valid
<br>
prediction to make, as much as a weather man predicts rain wherever
<br>
there are clouds....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More to the point, the race of the person is not indicative of future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior.  It is not statistically predictive.  It may be true that blacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commit more crimes than whites.  However, most black people are law-abiding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens, as are most white people.  Poverty would be a more scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicator.  
</em><br>
<p>It would be a more accurate indicator, not necessarily more scientific.
<br>
The stats show that give blacks and whites of the same level of poverty,
<br>
blacks are still more likely to commit crime, to a lesser degree than
<br>
comparing blacks to whites as a whole, but the probability is still
<br>
there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A white street bum would probably be more dangerous than a rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black businessman or a black preacher.  When we adjust for these better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factors, we would find that rich black business men are probably no more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to commit crime than rich white business men.  Likewise, a black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preacher is probably no more likely to commit a crime than a white preacher.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore, the race is not a good indicator at all.  The relative wealth of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the person or religious value is a better indicator.
</em><br>
<p>You are leaving out black and white poor people. You are right that
<br>
blacks and whites of relatively comfortable means have very similar
<br>
rates of committing crime, but among black and white poor people, blacks
<br>
are still more likely to commit crime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore, I don't really care if we call these attitudes racist, prejudice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or discrimination.  To link unrelated traits to race is racist.  To make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions based on race rather than people's individual merits is racist.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't see much value in arguing whether something is racist, racially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prejudiced or racially discriminatory.  Let's just say that it is just plain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientifically invalid, and leave it at that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is there any good reason to split hairs with these terms, except to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to practice prejudice and discrimination while claiming not to be racist?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, there is. If you were following my essays on trust and political
<br>
enfranchisement here in the US, you'd recognise why. I most emphatically
<br>
do NOT say that the probability of committing crime is genetic. To the
<br>
contrary, it is part and parcel of the trust dynamic in society. Those
<br>
we trust least are more likely to breach trust. Part of it is a self
<br>
fulfilling prophesy of expectations about the behavior of those we trust
<br>
least, the rest is generally a self perpetuating attitude of resentment
<br>
in those who are poorly trusted.
