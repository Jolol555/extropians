<p>Er, no. We -- the British public -- were paying approximately twice
<br>
as much to the Jamaican producers for their bananas as we're paying
<br>
to United Fruit for the imports we're now buying. Guess what: that's
<br>
money that isn't going to the small Jamaican farmers any more, it's
<br>
going to United Fruit.
<br>
<p>I can personally live with bananas that cost 50p a kilo as easily as I
<br>
can live with bananas that cost 20p a kilo. But Jamaica can't. Or, to
<br>
put it another way, Mike: &quot;freeing up trade&quot; has just put a massive
<br>
deflationary crimp on the Jamaican economy, while fucking them over
<br>
royally by tying any loans they get to a 19% interest rate. At that kind
<br>
of interest rate, is it any wonder that so many third world countries
<br>
end up defaulting?
