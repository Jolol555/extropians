From: &quot;Michael M. Butler&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:butler@comp-lib.org?Subject=Re:%20The%20poisoned%20tree,%20was%20Re:%20Argument%20From%20Authority&In-Reply-To=&lt;004901c1278a$002cf140$49d74cd8@newstrom&gt;">butler@comp-lib.org</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; ...I take it, then. that &quot;right, for the wrong reasons&quot; doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist in your way of thinking? Fruit of the poisoned tree, and all that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words, if a hardcore creationist claims that Newtonian mechanics
</em><br>
is due
<br>
<em>&gt; to the peculiar psychology of angels pushing planets around, is he
</em><br>
incapable of
<br>
<em>&gt; producing correct calculations using G*M1*M2/r^2 ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes he will make the correct decision IF he uses that correct equation.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, because he IS doing it for the &quot;wrong reason&quot; he might
<br>
decide NOT to use the correct equation.  He might decide that the Angels are
<br>
going to punish America for Bush's stem-cell decision, and hurl the planets
<br>
into a collision course.
<br>
<p>That's the big problem with &quot;right for the wrong reason&quot;.  It may parallel
<br>
&quot;right for the right reason&quot;, but it won't forever.  The fact that it is for
<br>
a different reason from the &quot;right&quot; reason means that somewhere, under some
<br>
circumstances, the &quot;right for the wrong reason&quot; theory will give different
<br>
answers than the &quot;right for the right reason&quot; theory.
<br>
<p>&quot;Right for the wrong reason&quot; is like a random number generator.  It's
<br>
sometimes right; it's sometimes wrong.  Why even bother checking the
<br>
answers?  You have to have an independent source for the answer.  The random
<br>
number generator is superfluous.
