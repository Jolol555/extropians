<em>&gt; I'd consider myself a transneanderthal but not yet a postneanderthal.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular class of transneanderthal I currently belong to is &quot;human&quot;, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hope to eventually belong to a more extreme class of transneanderthal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentience.  Even if I hope to someday be a postneanderthal, though, I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no intention of ever ceasing to be a transneanderthal.  Indeed, being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transneanderthal is precisely what separates us from the apes and defines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our identity as sentient beings.  I can only see augmentations as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuing to improve and increase the transneanderthal status I so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value.  Some may still be mourning the loss of our neanderthality, but now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we have abandoned it I see no way out but forward.  We are all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transneanderthals now and cannot help but become even more extreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transneanderthals in the future.
</em><br>
<p>Neanderthals weren't human, say scientists
<br>
<a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_365081.html?menu=news.scienceanddiscovery">http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_365081.html?menu=news.scienceanddiscovery</a>
<br>
New research suggests Ice-age Neanderthals were not our close relatives but a
<br>
completely different species.
<br>
<p>Until now many experts had believed Neanderthals, who co-existed with the
<br>
ancestors of modern humans 40,000 years ago, were a sub-species of Homo
<br>
sapiens.
<br>
<p>The new research at the University of Zurich is based on an analysis of infant
<br>
Neanderthal and modern human skulls.
<br>
<p>Their skulls were bulkier and had distinctive features including a projecting
<br>
face, heavy brows and a low forehead.
<br>
<p>Now computerised fossil reconstruction has shown these features were
<br>
established in early infancy, possibly even in the womb, rather than gradually
<br>
over time.
<br>
<p>The scientists write that such differences between Neanderthals and modern
<br>
humans during early development are consistent with &quot;separation of
<br>
Neanderthals and modern humans at the species level&quot;.
<br>
<p>The evidence suggests the ancestors of modern humans emigrated from Africa
<br>
about 100,000 years ago.
<br>
<p>Neanderthals probably lived alongside humans but died out because they were
<br>
less adaptable to the changing climate.
