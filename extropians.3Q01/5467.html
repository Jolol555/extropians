Yes, I just had a very heated argument with a friend on this subject last 
<br>
night (what makes it more absurd is that he is an immigrant himself so he 
<br>
ought to have more sympathy). I guess he is not totally to blame for his 
<br>
selfish views though -- our government of dickheads has been capitalising 
<br>
on xenophobia to wage a propaganda war lately. They say we are under threat 
<br>
of millions of people flooding here to the good life, so they lock them up 
<br>
in concentration camps when they get here or turn them away at the door. [sigh]
<br>
<p>What I don't understand is how 400 people can be equated with millions. It 
<br>
becomes even more depressing when you consider that study after study shows 
<br>
that immigrants work much harder than us slack and pampered locals to make 
<br>
Oz a more wealthy country. (I wonder if it has anything to do with them 
<br>
being islamic. Many of the more uncharitable christians seem to have an 
<br>
irrational irreconcilable hate for islamic people.)
<br>
<p>Sure Oz is not as big as it looks -- it has about the land area of 
<br>
continental USA but 95% of people (about the population of NYC I think) 
<br>
live in a thin strip around the edge. The interior is mostly desert. But 
<br>
surely we can help people in desperate need and earn good karma points in 
<br>
sharing some of our good fortune.
<br>
<p>All-round a major bummer. Poor bastards are being used as political 
<br>
footballs. I feel really sorry for them. They have sunk all their money in 
<br>
a desperate attempt to flee an insane system, only to run into a wall 
<br>
erected by another stupid bunch of assholes. It scares me that they will be 
<br>
sent back to a nasty end in jail or death... if they don't get wasted at sea.
<br>

<em>&gt;Shame on Australia

<em>&gt;SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since two years after the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, ships have been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;required by international law to rescue passengers from sinking vessels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Arne Rinnan, captain of the Norwegian cargo ship Tampa, did just that when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he was alerted by the Australian Coast Guard that an Indonesian ferry 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;carrying 438 people was sinking in international waters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The captain rescued passengers and asked permission to off-load them, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;required under the Convention on Refugees, in the nearest port, which is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in Australia. He says his ship is unseaworthy with so many people aboard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But the passengers were refugees fleeing Afghanistan's Taliban regime; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;400,000 have fled in the past year. Australia, a big country with a tiny 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;population, refused permission to dock and sent troops aboard to prevent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it. Strife-torn Indonesia also said no.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Australia should be ashamed of itself. This unconscionable replay of &quot;Ship 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Fools&quot; is both cruel and dangerous. It sends the unacceptable message 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to ship captains that it's best not to get involved rescuing people from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sinking ships.

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
