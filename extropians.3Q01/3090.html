<br>
<p><em>&gt;P.S. Standing challenge to any of you liberals out there:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;top that!  Confess how you have articulated to yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something as explosive as &quot;Fred Reed's piece is racist&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but with the shoe on the other foot, and how you, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though it was exceedingly painful, had to give huge aid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and comfort to your ideological opponents.  (P.P.S.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't think any of them will.)
</em><br>
<p>Um, Lee, who do you think of as a &quot;liberal&quot;? You know a lot about my ethical 
<br>
and political views by now. Do I count? The word &quot;liberal&quot; tends to mean 
<br>
something different over here and it has many different nuances 
<br>
historically.
<br>
<p>Also, who on this list counts as one of my ideological opponents? Daniel, 
<br>
Jerry and Mike because they are (I think) full-on libertarians whereas I 
<br>
have some libertarian tendencies but also a lot of theoretical and practical 
<br>
concerns about formal libertarian systems of thought? Samantha, who has a 
<br>
tendency to spirituality whereas I am a self-confessed ferocious atheist? 
<br>
You because you seem to have a social conservative streak whereas I don't?
<br>
<p>I have often defended people who are my &quot;opponents&quot;, in various senses, or 
<br>
gone out of my way to give credit to them or their ideas where it is due. 
<br>
I'm not sure I can give an absolute killer on-list example, but I think the 
<br>
attitude I have taken to such &quot;opponents&quot; belies the implication of your &quot;I 
<br>
don't think any of them will&quot;. Actually, this looking for credit in our 
<br>
opponents and their ideas is one way that we grow intellectually.
<br>
<p>Your comment was probably not directed at me, but I'm sure Olga, Damien and 
<br>
so on (if they are the &quot;liberals&quot; you meant) could all make similar 
<br>
observations about themselves and their attitudes.
<br>
<p>Puzzled
