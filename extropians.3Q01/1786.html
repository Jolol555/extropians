<em>&gt;&gt;An example is housing.  Given the relative level of sophistication of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;cheaply manufactured in Mexico and shipped here. Never mind the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;current model/style of moble home:  simply consider the possiblities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;in the realm of very cheap modular housing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;At whos expence?
</em><br>
<p>Well, um, the person buying the cheap manufactured house, for one?
<br>
<p>And implied by my post is that the person with the &quot;traditional&quot; house
<br>
down the street would not be able to sell HIS house. Why? Because I
<br>
could probably buy a factory-line, modular house in Mexico and have it
<br>
shipped here if not for the myriad of laws that prohibit such. So when
<br>
I buy the cheap house, I won't buy yours, so your house goes down in
<br>
value. So the transaction is also at YOUR expense. So therefore YOU
<br>
vote for politicians who prop up your money with laws. All implied by
<br>
my post...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; But prevailing laws prevent that.  Look as an example at the many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;laws against the placement and moving of mobile homes.  I doubt you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;are even aware of the scope and magnitude of these laws. And never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mind zoning and housing associations...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I agree about the zoning laws, their clearly anti-freedom based.
</em><br>
<p>Zoning laws are all libertarians seem to see...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Homeownership assoc. on the other hand are a perfectly acceptable mechanism to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;block off&quot; a large section of area to keep it all under one set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;standards. As long as their is no force being delivered from the government,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people are free to contract and make arrangments all they want. If you dont
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like the rules of a particular group, dont deal with them and find a group
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you like.
</em><br>
<p>So if I put chains on you, that's OK since it's &quot;private&quot;?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;These laws act to prop up the values of current ocuppied and future
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;homes--at the expense of those without a home.  So now the 60% or so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of people own homes in the USA can prop-up their own wealth... at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;expense of others. Many of these &quot;others&quot; can be seen sleeping under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;bridges.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I would be willing to bet a VERY large percentage of people sleeping under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bridges in the US are their from the choices they made. (99% maybe?,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certainly over 95%). They were not put there by &quot;Tha manT&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, common sense tells us that those people are just one small
<br>
fraction of the players in the housing market.  Walk around some of
<br>
these crappy apartments. There is where the moeny is being made.... 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The recent  removal of barriers to immigration into the USA help to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;prop up property values and therefore preserve the wealth of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that are land owners, and conversely, help to empty the pockets of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;those that are not landowners.  Those green pieces of paper fly out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the pockets of the landless and into the pockets of the landed. With
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;more people coming into the country, more green pieces of paper are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;flying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Man, lock out the aliens, and were depriving them of the chance for a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life, let them in and were exploiting them... Plus, this sounds kinda
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conspritorial as if smoking man had the plans for this locked up out in area
</em><br>
<em>&gt;51.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Conspiracy accusations....ho hum
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;Medical care is another of the pillars of a &quot;comfortable life&quot;.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;note that the physician lobby acted a few years ago to limit the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;supply of doctors.  The accompanying propaganda was laughable...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I to agree against the government &quot;limiting&quot; or licensing doctors, nurses,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;midwives, etc.... Theres tons of other ways to accomplish this without their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intrusion (which I dont feel the need to go into here).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Doctrinaire libertarianism....ho hum
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;Ehrenbach is completely right (in her recent book _Nickled and Dimed_
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;which detailed her sojourns as a low paid worker) when she said that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;we all exploit these low paid workers.  In fact, our own wealth and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;status depends upon their presence. If they were not poor and working
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to obtain the resources we possess, much of our wealth would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;worthless.... just pieces of green paper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why am I &quot;exploiting&quot; the guy at the drive through a mcdonalds? If hes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;teen working there, Id say its a great job for him. If its a 30 year old man
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with a family working there, Id say hes made some REAL bad choices in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life. I guess you could argue that our society exploits stupidity or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lazyness...
</em><br>
<p><p>Did you read my post? Maybe, but you sure didn't understand it....
