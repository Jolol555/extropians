<p>Sounds like the description of a jail cell.....
<br>
<p>#### But there is huge difference - you can walk out any time if you think
<br>
you can do better on your own. You are free. 
<br>
<p>Aside from that, this approach would very cheaply (how much would it cost to
<br>
provide what I described - 10-20$/day ?) provide a full safety net (medical
<br>
care would be also included under certain circumstances) for all who need it
<br>
- the unemployed waiting for a job, the elderly who didn't save enough, the
<br>
battered wife who had to run from her husband - but no freebies for
<br>
cheaters. A low price for a clear conscience.

Brian:
<p>Okay, he's 16, which means he should be covered by his parents
insurance, unless he has no parents in which case he's a ward of
the state. Those provisions would apply.
<p>#### What if the parents don't feel like paying the insurance? Kids
shouldn't have to pay for their parent's stupidity (in this case, kid with
stroke, I would pay for his treatment and collect as much as possible from
his parents)
<p>----
The question is always who's going to pay, I'm of the mind that
individual adults are responsible for themselves and their
children.
<p>#### 100% agreement. If you can't provide - don't proliferate. However,
being &quot;responsible&quot; for me means doing your best, doing the right thing.
Sometimes this is not enough to live - say, you make 10 000 $/year, flipping
burgers. You are not smart enough to get a better job but you are honest and
careful. You want to pay for your health insurance but it would cost you 7
000 $. Even if you rent a single room and share it with 3 other guys and eat
leftovers at McDonalds, you cannot afford it. No car, no fun, no CD's, no
dating (well, maybe sometimes). If you have no health care, even a simple
ruptured appendix can kill you. I feel I have a duty to help, if I can. I
think in this case, if you prove your responsible thinking by paying as much
as you can, you should get help - money to cover the rest of what needs to
be paid. This is life-saving money, and not encouraging indolence.
<p>----
Brian:
<p>There should be limited means for special cases, and there are.
<p>##### I agree with you. 
<p>&gt;&gt;I do care about people and as I stated here in the U.S there are
&gt;&gt;provisions, but I do not support an enlarging of these provisions
&gt;&gt;when every piece of evidence we have says it will be to the long
&gt;&gt;term detriment of all involved.
<p>&gt;#### Very good. Could you perhaps elaborate - give examples of
&gt;situations where you would feel morally obliged to render help?
&gt;(some real life stories, persons, ages, especially those that
&gt;describe the limits of your charity). Also, what &quot;provisions&quot; do
&gt;you mean specifically?
<p>Quite the trap you've set. ;)
<p>###Thank you.
<p>My favorite biblical story was always the good Samaritan.
<p>I've rendered first aid at numerous accidents, interfered in a few
crimes, and have been known to make considerable contributions to
charity. I'm a regular donor of platelets to the American Red Cross
(18 times 2 units each last year, 8 this year plus this Sat) and a
member of the national bone marrow registry. In short, I've never
walked away from anyone who needed my aid with the exception of a
few bums pretending to be homeless. (there is a difference).
<p>### Sorry if I ever implied you might be uncharitable.
<p>Probably my only limits are those of ability.
<p>I guess by provisions I mean I don't support the idea of a
government run universal health care system. I had a taste of that
when I was in the military, and didn't like it a bit.
<p>### I agree that a government-run system would be bad but I still think that
tax-derived subsidies for coverage for the very poor (through private
insurers, not Medicaid) would be OK. I had a taste of goverment-run health
system back home in Poland and didn't like it, either.
<p><p>-----
Brian:
<p>I'm convinced most people who do support the idea are convinced
that everything will remain the same only everyone will be covered.
I know that won't be the case.
<p>&gt;By the way, I am also strongly opposed to a balloning welfare and
&gt;wealth-transfer system. Any transfer that is supposed to give a
&gt;&quot;decent&quot; life (free cable, food stamps, rent) is wrong - because
&gt;the state threatens to kill the taxpayer for the sake of other
&gt;persons' amenities, trifles, little wishes. Only that help which
&gt;is absolutely and unavoidably necessary to prevent innnocent
&gt;people from dying or physically suffering (like having a cancer
&gt;melting your bones), is IMHO acceptable.
<p>Well, there are public hospitals for this, like Chicago's Cook
County.
<p>#### Isn't it a case of &quot;your tax money at work&quot;? Maybe sometimes (very
infrequently, just a little bit) taxes lead to something good happening?
<p>------
 Brian:
I just happen to know people with two homes, three cars, two of
them SUV's who go on big vacations every year, and complain that
they can't &quot;afford&quot; health insurance.
<p>Some people need help getting their priorities straight.
<p>### Exactly. If you have money for more than the barest necessities (as
outlined before) you have to use it properly, and if you blow it on trinkets
- don't come begging for help when the &quot;unthinkable&quot; but so predictable
happens.
<p>I don't suggest offering subsidies to anybody who can pay by him/herself.
<p>The only reason why I support the use of taxes for charity (as opposed to
just voluntarily chipping in myself) is because there are some totally
uncharitable, selfish jerks out there (probably not a single one on this
list) - and they should chip in too (why - well, that's a long story for
another post).
<p>Somehow, I am getting the impression our ideas are more similar than it
appeared in the beginning of our discussion.
