On the subject of time series for literacy rates:
<br>
<p>Sorry Mike.  You objected to Pat's sources of data and pointed to other 
<br>
sources.  You then compared the recent statistics in your preferred sources 
<br>
to the earlier statistics in Pat's, and claimed that that showed the trend 
<br>
you believed.  If his oranges aren't any good, you can't prove anything by 
<br>
comparing your apples to them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
I didn't look for very long, but I didn't find time series at the URLs you 
<br>
posted.  Can you say where the time series are buried, so we can tell 
<br>
according to this (you claim) more objective standard what has happened 
<br>
over time?  The interesting question is what has happened to levels of 
<br>
literacy according to any unchanging standard of what it means to be 
<br>
literate.  If some unvarying standards show improvement and others show 
<br>
degradation, we can argue about the merits of the different standards, but 
<br>
until we see a series that shows the same standard being applied at 
<br>
different times, we haven't learned much about changes in literacy.
