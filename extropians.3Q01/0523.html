I've been trying to figure out who the following TV interview is with.
<br>
Anyone have any clues?
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------
<br>
WNYW 7/7/01 - 1:13 AM... Well, um, it's simple, really. It comes down to
<br>
failure--mine. I've sunk an enormous amount of r&amp;d into the project, and so
<br>
far-- so far it hasn't produced the breakthrough we 'd hoped for. Could you
<br>
give me a quick summary again of the, uh, the project? Of course. The
<br>
project is an attempt to produce artificial intelligence using the process of
<br>
k-base. K-base? The best way to understand k-base is to imagine chaos theory
<br>
in a multidimensional arena. Ok, so whatever this is you're talking about,
<br>
it's some sort of supercomputer. No, no. Not at all. It's not a computer. It
<br>
would have existed in the world of computers in the same way that we exist in
<br>
the world of oxygen, but it would have been a fully independent entity, an
<br>
entity with the ability to think and to learn, a fully creative being. But in
<br>
a box. No, no, Mr. Aikens. We're the ones in the box. We're constrained by our
<br>
sacks of flesh. We're limited by our-- our eyes and our ears. Imagine
<br>
something different. Imagine an entity that can move at the speed of
<br>
lightning, can push its consciousness down any electronic pathway. The
<br>
internet would be its body. Its arms would reach from black river to chin...
<br>
---------------------------------------
<br>
<p>K-base = MS Knowledge Base?
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
