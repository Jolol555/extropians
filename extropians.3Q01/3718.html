<p>
Mitch,
<br>
<p>I relate very much with your feeling of having come up with the idea of the
<br>
singularity on your own. For me the ideas would probably have remained
<br>
implicit and rather unorganized without the catalyzing effect of several
<br>
writers, but the ground was ready.
<br>
<p>I vividly remember the jolt of pure pleasure on first hearing the dialogue
<br>
at the end of H.G. Wells' motion picture Things to Come, culminating with
<br>
&quot;Which shall it be?&quot; But the singular event (no pun intended) was reading
<br>
Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future and in particular the chapter &quot;The
<br>
Obsolescence of Man&quot; some thirty years ago. The experience was like: &quot;Yes.
<br>
Yes. Of course.----Click, click, click&quot;, and the world was changed forever.
<br>
The metaphysics of entity and substance was replaced with one of
<br>
information, process and system. I would try to talk about it when
<br>
conversation moved in that direction, but nobody seemed to get it.
<br>
<p>About your sense of the universe storing all information, I've wondered what
<br>
feeling of sheer surprise most people in an earlier age must have felt when
<br>
first exposed to the phonograph-that by getting into the physics of it,
<br>
something as evanescent as a spoken utterance could be preserved long after
<br>
the speaker had died. The surprise is not so much the ingenuity of the
<br>
invention, but the discovery that nature contains the mechanism to support
<br>
such a thing.
<br>
<p>The holograph is a step beyond that, showing that the information storage
<br>
can be deeply coded and distributed in a very unobvious way, but again
<br>
nature contains the mechanism for decoding as well as coding. I was once
<br>
very taken with David Bohm's interpretation of quantum mechanics. His
<br>
implicate order, for which our everyday world-the explicate order-was like a
<br>
froth on the surface of a vast sea, seemed to match your sense of universal
<br>
recording. And like the phonograph and the holograph there was a suspicion
<br>
that the recording could be recovered. It would certainly require ingenuity,
<br>
but the important thing was that there would be a natural mechanism that
<br>
could eventually be discovered.
<br>
<p>After reading David Deutsch's Fabric of Reality I was converted to the Many
<br>
Universe Interpretation (not that I presume a mastery of the technical
<br>
detail necessary for an 'informed' opinion). That seems to put the idea of
<br>
the universal recording further away, certainly in any individual universe.
<br>
But perhaps the &quot;over-universe&quot; that contains the many universes bears a
<br>
resemblance to Bohm's implicate order. So I wonder if there will eventually
<br>
turn out to be a natural mechanism to facilitate gathering the bits of data
<br>
from multiple universes so that an arbitrary piece of the past can be
<br>
recovered-like Mozart, just before he died, or a piece of the real Jurassic
<br>
Park, or all our ancestors.
<br>
<p>Maybe that's just the ultimate &quot;Pie in the sky, By and By.&quot; I really don't
<br>
know. But thanks for your e-mail, Mitch. It really struck a chord.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don Klemencic

<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Just out of curiosity, I'm wondering how many on this list feel they came
<br>
up with the idea of the singularity on their own. I feel like I did, and was
<br>
surprised to find an organization based, in large part, on the concept.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I am more then a little embarassed about this (and probably should be) but I
<br>
have, in the Shermer sense of believing &quot;weird things&quot;, have long suspected
<br>
that there are/is a mechanism in the universe, for storing all information.
<br>
Call it a backup or a system-save or whatever, but I supected it. Basically,
<br>
I am still, looking for all facets of this (perhaps nonsensical) idea. Or as
<br>
Thoreau once said: &quot;Build your castles in the air, then put a foundation
<br>
under it.&quot; Which is what I seem to be devoted to. Call it a process on the
<br>
way to Singularity.
<br>
<p>Mitch
