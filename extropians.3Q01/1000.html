<br>
<p><em>&gt; To the hard-core deconstructionists out there, I suggest going out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and playing music or dancing or using some other means to turn off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your deconstructionalist tendencies. Please remember that we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different value systems, different 'true' and 'untrue', different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences and so on.
</em><br>
<p>I just can't agree that we have different &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;
<br>
and can just leave it like that.  So long as I have time, in
<br>
Socrates' words, &quot;it's not that your words triumph over time,
<br>
nor mine over yours, but that we find the truth&quot;.  He didn't
<br>
say &quot;but that you find your truth and I find mine&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't agree that deconstructing the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with science yields all answers possible.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are other ways to learn and discover too.
</em><br>
<p>Discover what?  I can discover what makes me happy, or gives
<br>
me serene joy, or whatever.  Those may or may not be scientific
<br>
truths.  But generally, to *learn* something means to discover
<br>
what is true *about the world*.  Now I'm not going to argue
<br>
about what &quot;learn&quot; means on top of everything else.  If the
<br>
rational search for saying what's real about the world that
<br>
some of us engage in solely when we post to public lists isn't
<br>
always your cup of tea, that's understandable.  Try to steer
<br>
clear, then, of discussions that are focused on trying to say
<br>
what's objectively and publicly true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can you tell me that you know all that is in your subconscious?
</em><br>
<p>No, not by the ordinary meaning of &quot;you&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you learn from everything you can of what's around you?
</em><br>
<p>No, my attention is limited, alas, and much escapes me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Have you used every tool that seems useful in order to know?
</em><br>
<p>What does that mean?  Well, there are many search engines
<br>
that I haven't yet used.  But I'm at a loss to know what
<br>
else you mean.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you find joy and wonder and wisdom in what's around you?
</em><br>
<p>At some times; not at others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee was originally asking questions for definitions, so I did my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolute best to find words (which mostly don't exist) to explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some perspectives.
</em><br>
<p>And I'm sorry that I did not have time to fully deal with
<br>
what you wrote---there's one concrete example of having 
<br>
failed to learn &quot;everything I could from what is around me&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... but I must say that I was horrified and very dissapointed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear the immediate knee-jerk condemnations &quot;False&quot; that my way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to try to see what was in my subconscious to gain wisdom, be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; open to learn from my environment, trying to bring me to a higher...
</em><br>
<p>Well, unless you quote someone, he or she can't be sure of
<br>
what you speak.  I did blatently use the word &quot;false&quot; in
<br>
some posts lately.  I certainly was not talking about anything
<br>
that you wrote.  I was discussing the belief systems that we
<br>
both disagree with---in terms of their strict claims.  If someone
<br>
says that the Earth is flat, they are simply, quite, wrong.  It
<br>
sure as hell is not that they have &quot;their truth&quot; and I have &quot;my
<br>
truth&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If my tools of discovery aren't your tools, then so what? I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like all of your tools either, nor does your way of 'discovering'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world appeal to me (I see it as dry, rigid and not very fun,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be honest), but I don't label your way as &quot;False&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Again, if that's me, the charge is untrue.  The most that can
<br>
be squeezed from me that says that your beliefs are false are
<br>
incredibly mild things, such as, perhaps, like &quot;Amara describes
<br>
some beliefs incorrectly&quot;, or whatever.  But there isn't anyone
<br>
I've ever met of whom I'm going to pronounce everything they
<br>
believe to be true.
<br>
<p>The biggest single reason that I post is to have my beliefs
<br>
criticized.  What's yours?
<br>
<p>Lee
