Lee Corbin, Emlyn, Robert Bradbury and others have been talking in a 
<br>
relatively calm tone about &quot;eugenics&quot; recently.  I just want to point out 
<br>
that while it may be possible for some people to use this term calmly, it's 
<br>
an extremely loaded term when used in public.  It's loaded enough that it 
<br>
would really be a good idea to find a better word.
<br>
<p>While there are people who object to the idea of selective breeding of 
<br>
people (which is the same idea as, but a completely different slant than 
<br>
some people deciding not to have children with certain genetic 
<br>
characteristics), the real strike against the term is that the Nazis used 
<br>
it to mean the selective killing of people the government didn't like.   At 
<br>
this point, there's no way to disassociate the term from that meaning.
<br>
<p>I can't imagine why anyone would want to use the term today if they hoped 
<br>
to convince others to listen to them calmly.  A few people will be able to 
<br>
listen calmly, but others will start looking for tar and feathers.  Why 
<br>
would you want to start a conversation around this word?
