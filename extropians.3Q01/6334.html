I've been posting way too much crap today, so this will be the last one
<br>
for today. Samantha, while your sentiments are understandable, you're imo
<br>
overracting. Please reconsider.

<br>
Hi Pakistan
<br>
Wednesday, 23 Jamadi-us-Saani 1422 (12 September 2001)
<br>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Accusing fingers are being raised against Osama bin Laden
<br>
and his hosts Taliban, besides Islamic Jihad, for an unprecedented
<br>
and horrifying attack on America which forced most powerful man in
<br>
the world, US President Bush, from coming back to the White House and
<br>
who said that &quot;America will hunt down and punish&quot; the terrorists.
<br>
<p>Time has come for the Jihadi adventurists and their associates to
<br>
face the wrath of the mightiest of the world whom no one can now stop
<br>
from cleansing the menace and its apologists and quite ruthlessly in
<br>
the wrongly accused Muslim world. Never had in its history the United
<br>
States had ever faced such a catastrophe, not even during the attack
<br>
on Pearl Harbour, with power symbols falling down one after the other
<br>
from New York to Washington, including the World Trade Center and the
<br>
Pentagon, in what appears to be a well coordinated terrorist attack
<br>
by using the passenger planes.
<br>
<p>Whoever had perpetrated this well coordinated and most provocative
<br>
adventurist terrorist attack has in fact provoked the sole superpower
<br>
to retaliate at will wherever it wants and with no one to stand in
<br>
its way, and against the interests of the Muslim world. In, at least
<br>
one attempt, the terrorists have shown how much even the United
<br>
States is vulnerable to the retaliation by highly desperate and the
<br>
extremely hopeless and the most frustrated among discriminated and
<br>
radicalised sections in the Muslim world. What the alleged revenge
<br>
seekers among the most detested militant elements ignored is the fact
<br>
that they, if they are really involved, have in fact provoked the
<br>
mightiest superpower in the human history to go berserk. Experts
<br>
after experts in the US media left no ambiguity in implicating the
<br>
&quot;Islamic terrorists&quot;, especially Osama bin Laden, and the need for an
<br>
&quot;integrated action&quot; against the perpetrators and backers of
<br>
terrorism. Most disturbed in the Muslim World was Yasser Arafat, the
<br>
PLO Chairman, who knew the adverse repercussions and rightly
<br>
expressed his deeply and genuinely felt grief for the American people.
<br>
<p>Despite a senseless display of some thoughtless jubilation among a
<br>
very small number of Palestinian youth, the Palestinian leadership
<br>
look genuine in condemning the most horrendous act. On the other
<br>
hand, Taliban Foreign Minister Wakeel Ahmad, despite condemning the
<br>
terrorists, looked unconvincing to the world since he defended bin
<br>
Laden at the same time who is now increasingly being accused of
<br>
planning such a well coordinated act. The American experts, from
<br>
former secretary of state Henry Kissinger to ambassador Richard
<br>
Holbrooke, implicated the Islamic militants, especially bin Laden,
<br>
for the ghastly act. The emphasis was squarely laid on the door of
<br>
rogue states, Taliban regime in Afghanistan in particular. It was
<br>
alleged that the previous attack on the World Center, destruction of
<br>
two US embassies in Africa, attack on US Cole ship in Yemen and an
<br>
aborted plan to shoot down 11 passenger airplanes over Atlantic were
<br>
planned and executed by Osama bin Laden or his associates.
<br>
<p>The greatest sufferer of the US retaliation against a variety of
<br>
&quot;Islamic terrorists&quot; are going to be the most unfortunate
<br>
Palestinians and, more probably the &quot;proud Afghans&quot; being led by
<br>
Taliban who will now be facing an unprecedented attack by the US and
<br>
its broadest coalition, maybe worse than that on Iraq. This
<br>
probability brings Pakistan into an embarrassing focus of an ally of
<br>
the harbourers of Osama bin Laden, the Taliban.
<br>
<p>Although Pakistan has agreed to observe UN Security Council sanctions
<br>
against the Taliban, its pleas to engage Mulla Omar regime is going
<br>
to backfire and may cost Pakistan too heavily if Islamabad did not
<br>
now amend its Afghan policy drastically. To avoid a worst case
<br>
scenario, Islamabad needs to leave Taliban on their own if they don't
<br>
amend themselves, they are unlikely to since they refuse to listen to
<br>
Pakistan's good advice under the influence of the rogue Arab fanatics
<br>
in Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>The showdown with the US and Security Council on Taliban that was
<br>
being expected to come in the next six months is now very close and
<br>
Islamabad must not in any way be backing up the rogue regime of
<br>
Taliban to avoid being clubbed with the militia. Not only the
<br>
Taliban, but also all kinds of Jihadis are going to be brought into a
<br>
very rigorous scrutiny, including those Jihadis in Kashmir who are
<br>
linked to Taliban and bin Laden.
<br>
<p>President Musharraf, when he meets President Bush, will be facing a
<br>
very uphill task in distancing from the Jihadis and the Taliban in
<br>
particular. No one will now buy our argument in any way in defence of
<br>
Jihad, even if it is related to the most genuine cause of the
<br>
Kashmiris. This development will also toughen further New Delhi's
<br>
position on &quot;cross-border terrorism&quot;.
<br>
<p>The repercussions of this unprecedented terrorist attack on the
<br>
United States will have very deep repercussions on the relations
<br>
between the Muslim world and the West. From aggressive intrusion into
<br>
the sovereignty of the Muslim countries to the policy of immigration
<br>
and violation of all international norms in tracking down the
<br>
so-called terrorists in the Islamic world, the US has now got a very
<br>
justifiable pretext to teach a lesson to the culprits that may not in
<br>
fact affect the accused but the common people who will, in turn, look
<br>
towards the fundamentalists who are quite competent in bringing ever
<br>
increasing miseries to the common Muslims.
<br>
<p>More importantly, and quite disturbingly, the massive terrorist
<br>
attack on the US will strengthen the conservatives in the US Congress
<br>
and the Cold War warriors in the Bush administration. A bipartisan
<br>
consensus will emerge in favour of nuclear and conventional response
<br>
against the rogue states and the terrorists who can only be handled
<br>
by unconventional means. The missile defence system will now be
<br>
pushed ahead regardless of the fact that it will erode three decades
<br>
of non-proliferation regime. Whoever has executed this terrorist
<br>
attack has in fact played as agent provocateurs to the advantage of
<br>
the hard-liners in the US. It's time that the Muslim world distance
<br>
itself from all kinds of Jihadis.
<br>
