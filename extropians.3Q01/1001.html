</em><br>
<p>Actually, what I said was that Cyc didn't understand the sentences that
<br>
were being programmed in, because it didn't understand the words.  It
<br>
doesn't help to correctly parse the syntax of the sentence &quot;the ball is
<br>
red&quot; as &quot;apply(adjective: 'red', noun: 'ball')&quot; if the AI doesn't have a
<br>
visual cortex, an abstracted symbol for 'red'ness, and a prototype image
<br>
for 'ball'.  Cyc conceivably has abstract knowledge about which symbols
<br>
tend to be associated with each other, and occasionally, how those symbols
<br>
fit into more abstract network-like properties such as causal
<br>
relationships.  But the symbols are still pretty much devoid of content by
<br>
human standards.  Cyc has a tremendous amount of syntax but still very
<br>
little in the way of semantics, except for those symbols that are
<br>
fortunate enough to refer to fundamentally network-like or logic-like
<br>
referents.  So Cyc *might* understand &quot;before&quot;, &quot;after&quot;, &quot;cause&quot;, or even
<br>
&quot;supercategory&quot;, but not &quot;ball&quot; or &quot;red&quot;.
