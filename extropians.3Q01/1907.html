<p>Forgive me, I am not certain whether Eugene's reply was in jest, but count
<br>
me in as one who appreciated J.R.'s so-called wisecrack.  Interesting
<br>
&quot;contradictions&quot; pop up with most political persuasions and beliefs (example
<br>
of latter is congruity of hateful bigotry with of Jesus-loves-you
<br>
religiosity).

</em><br>
<p>Jerry is apparently talking about a stay-at-home-wife and kids (I may be
<br>
wrong, but otherwise why else would a &quot;guy&quot; need to give up some of his own
<br>
earnings any more than a working &quot;gal&quot; may need to give up some of her
<br>
earnings?).  And later on Jerry did say:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Having to give up your own earnings to fund someone else's laziness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;certainly unfair
</em><br>
<p>... and so I thought J.R. Molloy's observation was prescient (he caught the
<br>
contradiction)!  The question seems to come down not so much as to whether
<br>
childrearing is tough work (a point on which Natasha and Samantha weighed
<br>
in), but whether it's work at all?  Is it?  If it is, then maybe that work
<br>
needs to be validated with a paycheck.  After all, isn't that the capitalist
<br>
premise (promise?): you work = you get paid.  I know if there's a discussion
<br>
on this topic, someone will  point out that having children is a choice (and
<br>
I agree).  But then, so is buying a Jaguar.  But we will probably never see
<br>
Jerry Mitchell posting:  &quot;... but he needs to give up some of his own
<br>
earnings for the wife and luxurious family car.&quot;  Whaaaaat?  Add &quot;children&quot;
<br>
to the equation, and it's no longer the world's oldest profession?
<br>
<p>Ingratiating as always,
<br>
Olga
<br>
<p><p>To which Natasha retorted:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It makes sense to me that in a partnership where both parties want a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; family, that both parties work and pay equally.  Producing and raising a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; child is said to be one of the toughest jobs there is.
</em><br>
<p>And Samantha replied:
<br>
<em>&gt; Do you think that housewives don't work?   Ha!  It is a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better today but in most two wage-earner families I know of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; woman comes home from the office and does most of the cooking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cleaning and dealing with the children still on top of her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workday at the office.
</em><br>
<p>(Scenario 1), Natasha  is talking about both parties working and paying
<br>
equally, and childrearing is always tough (Scenario 2), and Samantha seems
<br>
to be saying whether housewives work outside the home, inside the home, or
<br>
both, it's all work, and childrearing is always tough (Scenario 3).
<br>
<p><p>, and I'm sure the socialist system recipient
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;acknowledges this as he/she cashes their government check.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Are you going to claim that guaranteed income or all social
<br>
programs only exist to fund the recipient's &quot;laziness&quot;?  Do you
<br>
really believe this?  Because that is sure what you seem to
<br>
imply.
