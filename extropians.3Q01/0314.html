</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, that's not correct--the pro-GM industry has lost it through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its own blundering incompetence.
</em><br>
<p>You are absolutely right.  It is more accurate to say that the industry shot
<br>
itself in the foot with this one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If GM foods are to continue to be a viable technology, we must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;able to control it so that we decide whether it goes into our food
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, you know, another blundering bad-PR strike against these guys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is their rabid insistence that there BE no labeling and, hence, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice. 'You'll eat it and drink it and pay us to do it whether you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to or not,' has been their attitude from the start--just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the food-irradiation guys.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I have spoken for labeling myself.  I fear allowing other people to
<br>
make scientific choices for me.  I often find myself in a scientific
<br>
minority.  Let's face it, cryonics, life-extension drugs, life-extending
<br>
diets, AI computing, and nanotechnology are controversial issues.  Many
<br>
scientists would gladly override our choices in these matters because they
<br>
do not believe we are scientifically correct.  I would rather have full
<br>
documentation, and then I will make my own choice.
<br>
<p>I don't trust the tobacco industry to tell me if cigarettes are safe for me.
<br>
I don't trust the meat industry to tell me if mad cow disease is a concern
<br>
for me.  I don't trust the auto manufacturers to tell me if my RV might flip
<br>
over.  I don't trust software manufacturers to tell me if their product has
<br>
bugs.  Frankly, I don't trust anybody with a large cash incentive to lie to
<br>
me.  Open documentation with independent verification is the only safety
<br>
protocol that works.
