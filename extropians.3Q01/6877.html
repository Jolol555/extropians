<p>Yeah Charlie i completely agree when i heard the speech i literally did a
<br>
double take, when i heard the word &quot;crusade&quot;. I was so amazed, i spent the next
<br>
ten minutes going through some self checks wondering if i'd hallucinated 
<br>
the word
<br>
&quot;crusade2 somehow.
<br>
Lets face it no one thought Busy was an expert at diplomacy, or had a brain 
<br>
bigger
<br>
than a walnut. Before he was elected. I am amazed at the size of this

somatic gaff

</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't like Dubya, but up until today I've had the impression that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was handling this crisis reasonably well -- not brilliantly, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;competently. (Which is all we can ask for of any president, really.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then he had to go and use the C-word in a public speech: &quot;crusade&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm speechless. Really, I am.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hasn't he been paying *ANY* attention to what's going on? And why didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his minders stop him from using that fatal word? All you have to do is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;read Osama bin Laden's original declaration of war on the west (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you can find at <a href="http://www.emergency.com/bladen98.htm">http://www.emergency.com/bladen98.htm</a>)  to realise that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ObL's political position is that the west is waging a Crusade -- in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;historical sense of the word -- against Islam.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In that fatwa, Osama bin Laden wrote &quot;The Arabian Peninsula has never --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;since God made it flat, created its desert, and encircled it with seas --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been stormed by any forces like the crusader armies spreading in it like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;locusts, eating its riches and wiping out its plantations.&quot; Then he went
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on to say, &quot;all these crimes and sins committed by the Americans are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clear declaration of war on God, his messenger, and Muslims.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's there, clear as day: Osama bin Laden's whole program is to accuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Americans of waging a Crusade -- a holy war against Islam, and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;call on moslems to rally round in a jihad against the crusaders. Now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Dubya has just stood up in front of a billion moslems and in effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;told them that Osama bin Laden is right; that this *is* a holy war
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being waged by the christian nations against islam.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have difficulty imagining a way he could have phrased it that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have been more inflammatory or offensive to the islamic countries --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Pakistan, for example, but also all the Arab countries -- who he's trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to drag into this coalition.  Here's a metaphor: imagine the response if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he'd announced his intention of sending troops to Somalia in terms like:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;we're jes' goin' to pacify the niggers&quot;. _That_ is what pinning the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;word &quot;crusade&quot; on America's response means to the islamic world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That's right, Dubya, you go on trying to build that coalition with Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;states as members. Don't you worry, they'll get the message. You've
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probably just given bin Laden the first ray of hope since the 11th
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of September.
