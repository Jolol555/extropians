<p><em>&gt; &gt; I guess I'm missing the problem here.  Certainly fixing leaking
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When fresh water is being thrown into the sea from rivers, it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absurd for them to be worrying over a few thousand cubic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feet of fresh water a year from a bad toilet valve.  My contention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that life is adaptable, and no ecosystem is *that* delicate.
</em><br>
<p>OK, good point.  Except that your estimate may be low.  Are you estimating
<br>
1000 toilets, each leaking a single cubic foot of water per year?  I would
<br>
assume a lot more toilets times maybe a cubic foot of water per day.  (Just
<br>
a nit.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Grab?  We would *buy* those lands for a pittance, and here is how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is calculated.  The vast grasslands which I speak of is sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used to grow grain and alfalfa, both fairly irrigation intensive, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; razor thin profit margins.  The price of the land is easily estimated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking a typical yearly profit margin, which is about 200 bucks an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acre year, then divide by the current cost of money.  Right now money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is about 6%, so that land can be bought up for about 3200 bucks an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acre, or in other words, practically free.
</em><br>
<p>I won't argue economics much, because it is outside my field.  However, you
<br>
are valuing the land based on its current use.  If it is required to save
<br>
the planet, the price would probably go up.  This does seem to be an
<br>
extensive plan in the future to recover from something that we haven't lost
<br>
yet today.  Also, if the land is cheap because it is so hard to grow crops
<br>
there, how are you going to grow massive forests cheaply?  It seems like
<br>
these lands already have proven difficult/expensive for plant growing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am all about here is pointing out the deplorable level of water control,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this in the biggie developed nations.  We really need to have better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control of water.  There is no shortage of fresh water; we dump the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff into the sea at the Sacramento River Delta, at the mouth of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Columbia, at the Mississippi River Delta.  We still have *floods* every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year along the Mississippi, floods!  Why dont we control water better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than that?  We can do better.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  This is the same for land, food, water, energy, money and freedom.
<br>
There is no shortage of any of these, but their is a distribution problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no need to put dykes around Florida, for if we hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sea level we could intentionally warm the planet, melt some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Northern ice and make for more productive land.
</em><br>
<p>You don't expect Florida voters to agree to that, do you?  I also don't
<br>
think most Floridians would want to leave the country to move back north.
<br>
Besides, we have developed lands and infrastructure.  You are trading
<br>
expensive, devolped, popular land for undeveloped, remote wilderness.  It
<br>
seems like you are trading the valuable quantity we have and know for a
<br>
potential of unknown quantity of dubious value in the future.  It doesn't
<br>
sound like a good trade to me.  Of, course I am trying to retire down in
<br>
Florida.  (&quot;It's always about Florida, isn't it Harv?&quot;)
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We could likely
<br>
<em>&gt; keep the Antarctic ice while clearing off most of Greenland and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much of Siberia.  Of course these are major projects, and currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we may have a shortage of people on this planet to get it all done,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but with encouragement, populations can be expanded to help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the project.  We could eco-engineer this planet into one that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a much better place for humans and transhumans.  Perhaps not so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great for mosquitos as it is today.  Why do we need to have harsh
</em><br>
<em>&gt; climates anywhere, when we have or can develop the technology to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fix it?
</em><br>
<p>I guess I agree with you in theory.  But I'm not quite ready to say that we
<br>
can throw away safety and precautions now on the assumption that we'll
<br>
figure out how to fix it later.  That would be like eating an unhealthy diet
<br>
because nanotech will replace my heart before it malfunctions, or avoiding
<br>
cryonic signup because the singularity will save me before then.  It might
<br>
work, but I wouldn't bet my life on it.  You eco-scenarios may very well be
<br>
true, but I wouldn't bet the planet on it.
