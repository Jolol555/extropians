<em>&gt; I honestly think this is irresponsible.  Terrorists are not as creative as
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>But consider: they don't even have the creativity to *look* in the
<br>
places we discuss for answers.  How hard do you think it would be, for
<br>
instance, to build a flock of UAVs, load 'em with McVeigh-style
<br>
explosives, have 'em swarm into the skyscraper of your choice and
<br>
blast a hole to the center column, then follow up with another swarm
<br>
loaded with napalm?  And that's just off the top of my head...
<br>
<p>Public discussion of technology will, on average, preceed terrorist
<br>
deployment of same if it is allowed to do so.  OTOH, if discussing
<br>
weapons (and how to stop them) were immoral and outlawed, only immoral
<br>
outlaws would discuss weapons, leaving the rest of us without defenses
<br>
when the time comes.  This is not just a cliche, but proven fact from
<br>
those areas where public discussion and research *has* been stifled on
<br>
&quot;ethical&quot; grounds, but the discussion and research holds obvious
<br>
potential.  It's gotten to the point that it's almost unethical to be
<br>
ethical anymore.
<br>
<p>Our technology can keep us ahead of our enemies (both tangible ones
<br>
like the terrorists and intangible ones like death itself), but only
<br>
if we continue to develop it as fast as possible.  To do less is to
<br>
throw away those lives we could save.
