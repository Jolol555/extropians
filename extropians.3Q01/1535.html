From: &quot;Technotranscendence&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:neptune@mars.superlink.net?Subject=Re:%20capitalist%20religion&In-Reply-To=&lt;027501c11127$8f42c900$ed5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">neptune@mars.superlink.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; That depends on what you mean by prudent.  If stealing is prudent, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful thieves should be seen as exemplars of that virtue.  Of course,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you judge people by how well they get along in each system, then certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; types of people do well in a welfare state -- not necessarily the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who would do well under either a free market or full socialism.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, successful theives (aka politicians) get along quite well in the welfare
<br>
system (which steals from productive workers and redistributes to sycophants).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You should also ask what it is that taxation and redistribution achieves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimately -- e.g., what sort of changes it makes in society.  More people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will devote their efforts to trying to get at unearned wealth and less to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other, more productive activities.  (Before it can be taxed, wealth must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produced.  The more taxes there are, the less reason there is for many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to produce.)
</em><br>
<p>Obviously.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would also point out, this class of tax takers includes not only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politicians, but, in general, those who chase after government money or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favors.  I recall in the 1990s, the Cato Institute <a href="http://www.cato.org/">http://www.cato.org/</a> came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out with a report on corporate welfare in the US, finding that this was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huge part of the Federal budget.  (I.e., reducing it, would reduce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overall budget -- and the money saved could be given back to the taxpayers.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I've heard of &quot;corporate welfare.&quot; Just like individuals, some
<br>
corporations produce wealth and some are parasites. Corporate lawyers, for
<br>
example, can be parasites on parasites. This, of course, has nothing to do
<br>
with capitalism, nor with religion. I'd classify it as a societal illness
<br>
which may or may not require corrective action, depending on how debilitating
<br>
it becomes to the community at large.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
