<p>One does not have to tell people it's pointless to work hard, get a good job
<br>
(or, more broadly speaking, well-paying work), get a good education. But for
<br>
those of us in the position to give advice, it would seem irresponsible to
<br>
tell people to do those things to the exclusion of maintaining flexibility,
<br>
CONTINUING one's education beyond the usual 4 to 8 years of university
<br>
study, not tying oneself too tightly to any one kind of work. In the 1950's
<br>
and even in the 60's it might have been accurate to tell someone that if
<br>
they studied hard, worked hard, got a good job, they'd be set for life. This
<br>
isn't true any more and hasn't been for at least a quarter of a century.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My question for you is this:  don't you think it somewhat inappropriate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to extort money from one set of persons (those who have innocently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accumulated wealth by self-denial, hard work, talent, industry, thrift,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or service to others)
</em><br>
<p>You didn't ask me, Lee, but I'll take the liberty of answering: Yes, I do
<br>
think it's inappropriate, which is why I say that GMI would work best with
<br>
small, self-governing populations. In the absence of a free lunch such as
<br>
might be provided by MNT (see below), there would have to be restrictions in
<br>
order for a guaranteed minimum income to work. This would include
<br>
restrictions on reproduction and, necessarily, on immigration into the
<br>
population covered by the GMI. I see no problem with such restrictions as
<br>
long as members of the population have agreed to it, or at least have agreed
<br>
to be bound by voting rules through which such a scheme is established.
<br>
<p>With respect to the existing situation in the U.S.A. I believe that a GMI
<br>
would probably be possible for no more than is currently spent on health,
<br>
education, and welfare benefits. As Damien said, it wouldn't be enough of an
<br>
income to provide a cushy lifestyle, but it would be enough to survive on,
<br>
particularly if laws were changed to allow people to build their own houses
<br>
and grow some of their own food. (Austin, Texas building codes allow a
<br>
person to do much of the work on her own home, as long as the work is done
<br>
under the supervision of a licensed person, and city ordinances now allow
<br>
permaculture gardens in front yards)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe it would be best to wait until ... a number of compassionate rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people will simply fund a minimal standard of living for everyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This should occur as we approach the Singularity, and we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the onerous stealing from the rich to give to the poor (by force).
</em><br>
<p>I'd think these rich people would want to impose at least SOME restrictions,
<br>
such as requiring recipients to undergo sterilization after the birth of one
<br>
or two children.
<br>
<p>A note on taxation as theft--people who'd never think of knocking down
<br>
another person and stealing his money are often happy enough to do this
<br>
through an agent, even in countries such as the U.S. where principals are
<br>
legally responsible for the acts of their agents. I think this is, at least
<br>
in part, a symptom of the corporate fiction which sees a corporation or a
<br>
state as a separate entity rather than a number of individuals acting under
<br>
a common banner.
