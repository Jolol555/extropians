</em><br>
<p>As one who sees everything as 'simply matter and physics', I can also
<br>
stated that I most certainly don't think that doing so eliminates value
<br>
or values or the sacredness of anything. This, I find, is a primary
<br>
fault of those who wax excessively about religion and spiritualism,
<br>
claiming that science is no better than another superstition. They
<br>
cannot imagine the possibility that the universe can be looked at in a
<br>
completely rational manner while simultaneously having a sense of awe
<br>
and wonder at it. They also have extreme difficulty imagining the
<br>
possibility that one could derive a set of values from objective
<br>
rational observation of the universe that is anything but a rather crass
<br>
and simplistic dog eat dog existence.
<br>
<p>It is these cognitive failings in the religionists that I find most
<br>
troubling, and is what I meant earlier when I said they are lacking. I
<br>
take great umbrage at the assertion that I lack in a sense of
<br>
aesthetics, that I don't appreciate beauty or human spirit, just because
<br>
I choose to look at the world rationally rather than from a position of
<br>
superstition and supernaturalism. I don't need religion to be spiritual,
<br>
and I don't need supernatural phenomena to feel at one with the
<br>
universe.
