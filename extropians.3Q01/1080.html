<em>&gt; Mike, I believe you are making at least one unsubstantiated leap.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The development of &quot;intelligent civilizations&quot; would appear to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depend in large part to the &quot;rate&quot; of evolution from simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organisms to higher organisms. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and which exhibits greater evolutionary rates, land or sea
<br>
organisms?
<br>
<p>I didn't say 'intelligent organisms' because this would be entirely
<br>
possible with waterworld planets (as we see so plainly with dolpins,
<br>
whales, octopi, etc). If the waterworld scenario holds, there would be
<br>
so little land available for land life, and most of that would be
<br>
heavily volcanic, and thus subject to high rates of cataclysmic
<br>
extinctions, far higher than would be beneficial to evolution toward
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>A species that evolves intelligence in water will never get beyond the
<br>
stage of harnessing fire for obvious reasons, unless it migrates to
<br>
land, and then is limited by the cataclysmic behavior of supervolcanos
<br>
that are the norm with thick crust worlds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The existence or lack of existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of large moons may effect the geology and length of the liquid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; water period of a planet, but there is very little evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (since we only have 1 data point) regarding the relation between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those phenomena and the evolution of intelligence.  We know for certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the mutation rate for an organism can vary over a wide range
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (contrast HIV with Deinococcus radiodurans).  Constraints on mutation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rates for higher level organisms are far from certain.  The most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recent evidence from comparisons between the Mouse &amp; Human genomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggests that factors that influence gene duplication and successive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adaptations may play a key role in the rate of evolution.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the development of intelligence may depend on two quite different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic mechanisms (gene duplication &amp; gene mutation rates) which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be independent of each other and have a very wide range of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible values.
</em><br>
<p>Also consider the prime points of my own argument, that did not focus on
<br>
the crust thickness issue that much. I focused on the magnetic field
<br>
phenomenon, where the tidal drag induced by a large moon induces a
<br>
differential rotational speed between inner and outer planetary layers
<br>
to generate a dynamo. A waterworld planet without a large moon would
<br>
have no magnetic field strong enough to protect it against cosmic rays
<br>
and radiation from its sun, so what land that did arise from
<br>
supervolcanos would be pummelled not only by constant volcanic activity,
<br>
but severe UV and other deadly levels of radiation. Thus any intelligent
<br>
species that did arise in the seas would not be able to migrate to land
<br>
without technology to protect it from radiation, but if it does not
<br>
migrate to land, it will never develop technology in the first place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Geologists &amp; astronomers can make all the arguments they want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about &quot;Rare Earth's&quot; and while those arguments will be interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are not &quot;trump cards&quot; because biology can compensate for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a very wide range of environmental variables.
</em><br>
<p>We would need to see evidence that life can thrive alone on islands that
<br>
are not only volcanically unstable, but bombarded by high radiation
<br>
levels due to lack of a magnetic field. If you can come up with a
<br>
possible scenario for such, I am all ears.
