</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; on some dirt-poor country far less capable of dealing with the disasters
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; will be more hatred of the United States.  I don't expect that will stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the United States from doing it anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Are you saying we should not respond to an act of war as such?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is exactly what I am saying.  A futile response is worse than no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response.  We should respond only if we can find and successfully target
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people who were actually responsible.  We should not launch a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spasmodic, useless, civilian-killing military attack on a randomly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selected country just because &quot;we have to do something&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>False dichotomy.  No one is advocating picking a country at
<br>
random. We are not helpless to find who did this or to go after
<br>
them.  We have no shortage of groups that have planned and
<br>
executed attacks on us or of governments who threaten us.  It is
<br>
now obvious that the threats are quite serious matters that
<br>
cannot be ignored.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Terrorists don't strike at the US because they think they can get away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with it.  Terrorists strike at the US because they hate the US and feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;they have to do something&quot;, no matter what the cost is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  The people who support them and set them lose are
<br>
not willing to pay the cost if it is too high.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How exactly would this make future terrorism using suitcase or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; larger nukes or a bioweapon less likely than if we took out as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; many major terrorist cells as we can find?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neither one will make it less likely, so we may as well focus on trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduce some of the underlying hate by actually obeying international law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a change.  A moderate, lawful response by the US at this point, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response that doesn't involve invading other countries just because we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get away with it, might have a real emotional impact in the minds of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries that believe, correctly, in the arrogance of the US.  That's how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Martin Luther King scored his victory.  Following international law even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after a major bombing would send a message that the US is willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose to play by the same rules imposed on non-superpowers.  It wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; halt terrorism but it might decrease the growth rate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I totally disagree with this attitude.  International law?  It
<br>
already has been broken.  Utterly.  War has been made on us. 
<br>
There is nothing lawful about it.  Arrogant?  We deserve to be
<br>
righteously angry and dig out those who did this to us. 
<br>
Arrogant? Our system IS better than that of most of the
<br>
pestholes that hate us and threaten us and our citizens at every
<br>
opportunity.  Or don't you care to notice the distinction? 
<br>
Arrogant?  We very seldom &quot;throw our weight around&quot; really. 
<br>
With our power most nations would really be arrogant and
<br>
extremely expansionist.  But we are not.  We often don't even
<br>
use our power when we despearately need to.  We will not play by
<br>
rules that require us to be nice to those who play by no rules
<br>
at all.  What you suggest will not halt the growth rate of
<br>
terrorism.  It will radically increase it because the &quot;Great
<br>
Satan&quot; has no bite and may be attacked with impunity except for
<br>
some long-winded legal procedures than in today's irrational
<br>
political climate may not result in any real justice at all.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Can you imagine the righteous indignation if Afghanistan were to mount a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military attack on the US under similar circumstances?  That is the
</em><br>
<p>It, or a similar band of hooligans ALREADY HAS!  Or did you miss
<br>
that?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; essence of the United States's arrogance - a double standard backed up by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superior military force.  It is that unbearable unfairness which creates
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer.  If you look at history with an open mind you will see
<br>
that we very, very seldom throw the weight of our military force
<br>
around at all that arrogantly.  We have gone out of our way, to
<br>
our own detriment, many times not to throw our weight around in
<br>
the way you have the nerve to accuse us of.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; the burning hatred and the willingness to attack, regardless of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences, just because it's so unbearable to think that the Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can bomb and bomb and never be touched themselves.
</em><br>
<p><p>I have nothing more to say to you right now.  You are in fantasy
<br>
land.
