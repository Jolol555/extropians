<p>Well, ja kinda.  Chris I think the world of you personally, and
<br>
I value your opinions.  Your short course you gave me on ecash at
<br>
last years nanoschmooze was quite educational.  However my
<br>
opinion of the San Jose Mercury News is actually lower than
<br>
that of the National Inquirer as far as a *news* source, for they
<br>
so blatantly spin stories.  I read the Merc and the SF Chron, not
<br>
so much for news as for entertainment, for I will hand it to the
<br>
Merc, their newspaper is *funny*.  Very entertaining, both papers.
<br>
But they do spin stories shamelessly.  Probably you will agree.
<br>
<p>I have struggled with the ethics of this.  Harvey's post on this
<br>
subject did cause me to waver.  Ordinarily I am pretty much
<br>
a hands-off business, let-business-do-what-business-does-
<br>
make-money kinda guy, but news reporting *is* different in a
<br>
way.  On the other hand, their constituency, those who still
<br>
rely on papers for *news*, i.e. those without internet, are
<br>
generally waaaaay left, so by spinning stories to the left, the
<br>
Merc is giving people what they pay for.  I am torn.
<br>
<p>A prime example of news spinning is the Merc's repeated
<br>
use of the phrase &quot;...California's disastrous and costly
<br>
experiment with power deregulation...&quot; etc.  Never once has
<br>
the Merc attempted to answer what would have happened
<br>
had taxifornia *not* attempted to deregulate power.  They
<br>
try to drill into the public by repetition that prices are set
<br>
by *governors*.  Shameful.  And the result of deregulation
<br>
is greedy Texas oil barons are robbing us?  Shameful, Merc.
<br>
But I digress.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; claims of the SDI project are still the best reference on this subject...

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Care to propose an alternative?  Reddell and Nelson (his co-author)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engaged in numerous debates with SDI proponents when SDI was hot twenty
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to look for them.
</em><br>
<p>The problem with this whole issue is that most of the critical documentation
<br>
is classified and most of the commentators uncleared, and many
<br>
are unclearable.  Professor Postal was not cleared to see that
<br>
many of the feats he declared impossible had in fact already been
<br>
accomplished.  They tried to clear him to show him the results, but
<br>
he refused to look at it.  Then bragged about it.  I guess he already
<br>
had it all figured out.  Sigh.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not in today's paper.  I didn't say a single missile could never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intercept an incoming warhead.  I said that's not the hardest problem it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has to solve to be more useful than dangerous.
</em><br>
<p>Granted there is a phase when it *is* more dangerous than
<br>
useful.  Like when the first blocks of the Great Wall were being
<br>
laid, and the first shovels of dirt in the Maginot Line, the first
<br>
nuclear subs.  All could be seen as provocative.  Right now,
<br>
SDI research is likely more dangerous than useful.  It needs
<br>
to pass thru that phase.  Before very long, nuclear missiles
<br>
will become more dangerous than useful.  For half a century
<br>
its been the other way.  But nukes alone will not not keep the
<br>
world safe.  More and more countries get them, you know
<br>
eventually some yahoo is gonna toss one.  May their targets
<br>
have some recourse other than praying to their god or gods
<br>
to save them, for I can *assure* them, he or they wont.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So far, the system isn't above %50 when there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one incoming, with several days warning of what the approximate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trajectory will be, and a single decoy (as I read the article today.)
</em><br>
<p>Clearly the system is in transition.  It may be 10 or 30 years
<br>
before a really credible system will have a chance against
<br>
multiple warheads.  But we do need to start somewhere.
<br>
If we dont, a nuclear war is only a matter of time.  Of course
<br>
the Singularity *might* come along and solve everything.  But
<br>
it might not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The FBM (if I understand what you're describing) is analogous to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system that needs to shoot down a single incoming missile.  Redundancy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leads to mutual interference in missile defense.
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily.  ABMs can be fired from different locations and
<br>
follow different paths.  The end-game strategies like PAC-3 have
<br>
fire-look-fire capability.  Especially if it is only one missile fired by
<br>
a rogue commie sub commander, I suspect we have a reasonably
<br>
good chance of taking it out, given a large number ABMs.  All the
<br>
diplomacy in the world cannot defend against some starving half-
<br>
crazed submariner out to kill masses of proletariat.  This phase of
<br>
SDI will not be effective against an all out strike by a well armed
<br>
foe, Im not arguing that it will.  But we must take the first step in
<br>
order to take the second.
<br>
<p>I can see a successful limited interceptor causing a lot of the small
<br>
nuke-less nations to give up trying to get nukes.  If they just say
<br>
to hell with it, the big guys are too far ahead, then the many hungry
<br>
citizens of these poorer countries will be spared great expense.  So
<br>
in that sense, SDI feed starving children.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  You can't just deploy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more identical systems.  They'll all have the same priorities when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choosing incoming targets.
</em><br>
<p>They are trying to design them to be stacked and redundant.
<br>
We shall see how it works.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You (and Mike) haven't responded to any of these points yet:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the US government, such undertakings are vastly more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; political.  Getting reliable funding for any one of these for the life of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the project is problematic.  Getting funding to work on integrating the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; systems doesn't even make sense until some of the systems work.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, steady funding is always problematic when major systems
<br>
span several presidential administrations.  The previous administration
<br>
set back progress about 6 yrs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...If you stop 90% of 20 missiles, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; threat has not been countered....A coalition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; defensive systems do have to coordinate, and this is one of the hardest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problems if you have to be close to %100 successful to be useful.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  We depend on *diplomacy* until the time when we
<br>
*can* stop *all* the nukes.  It may be many years in the future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'd like to hear how developing a system like this promotes stability in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the period in which it's an imperfect shield.  Chris
</em><br>
<p>Good chance it doesnt.  Fortunately that transition period is during
<br>
a time of relative peace, and should be over in 15 to 20 years.
<br>
Eventually however, we must go thru this dangerous time, since
<br>
MAD will not keep us safe forever.  As time goes on, the rich first
<br>
world countries become ever more vulnerable  to countries we
<br>
never even heard of, that hate us, that want us all dead because
<br>
of our incessant blasphemy against [fill in god or gods here].  Building
<br>
a nuke isnt that hard to do, and more of the little guys are doing it.
<br>
<p>Our nukes are the modern Maginot Line.  If we dont keep upgrading
<br>
and improving it, we should not be dismayed the day someone stomps
<br>
it flat.  MAD is not effective against a nation whose most valuable asset
<br>
was just launched toward us in the nose of a missile.
<br>
<p>Nukes gave us peace (well, sort of) for a while.  Unfortunately
<br>
new threats keep coming.  We need SDI and while we are at it, some
<br>
means of defense against nanoweapons, suitcase nukes, cyberspace
<br>
terrorism, all of it.  War hasnt ended, it has just shifted gears.
<br>
Let us shift with it.  Or perish.  spike
