<p>No. The truck bomb attempt in 1993 failed. That truck was a lot bigger
<br>
than a suitcase.  The airplane attack had more kinetic energy than such
<br>
a bomb, but the kinetic energy did not take down the towers. Each tower
<br>
collapsed after more than an hour of intense heat, which resulted from
<br>
the burning of roughly 10,000 gallons of kerosene (i.e. jet fuel.)
<br>
<p>Not all buildings are as strong as the WTCs. If your terrorist wants
<br>
to take out a smaller building, he might consider delivering a soda
<br>
machine rather than a suitcase.
