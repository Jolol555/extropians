</em><br>
<p>Yes. This is something that struck me when I grew past my child-innocence 
<br>
of thinking that our Western society was abnormally racist.
<br>
<p>I have some friends from the Philippines, and the stories they told of the 
<br>
way the Japanese treated Philippinos during the war are really horrific. Of 
<br>
course no side is blameless during war -- I mean it is really the ultimate 
<br>
senseless expression of &quot;us good, them bad&quot; with license to kill and maim, 
<br>
isn't it -- but wow, the torture and crazy violence visited upon the 
<br>
Philippinos astounded me. (I won't go into the revolting details here.) I 
<br>
was also surprised to find out that many restaurants in Japan still 
<br>
routinely discriminate against against Philippinos today. They are barred 
<br>
from entry.
<br>
[shakes head in wonder]
<br>
<p>I hasten to add that I've not seen any hint of this dark side in the 
<br>
Japanese I've met; they have each been enlightened and delightful people.
<br>
<p>My girlfriend is part Fijian. I was amazed when I found out she agreed with 
<br>
the Fijian coup and the move to discriminate against Fijians of Indian 
<br>
descent. There didn't seem to be any way to convince her that restrictive 
<br>
laws based soley upon race are unfair and dangerous. All she saw was the 
<br>
traditional Fijian culture being swamped by the Indian Fijians.
<br>
<p>Of all the stupid, arrogant isms we humans create, racism has to be one of 
<br>
the ugliest. I am so glad it seems to be a dying meme. I can hardly wait 
<br>
till we get lifespans exceeding hundreds of years so that people can 
<br>
finally get a chance to truly grow up. It is an exciting thought that it 
<br>
may well be soon.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
