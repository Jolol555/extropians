<p>Yes it does, but the movement of equality between the genders is now in

a &quot;separate but equal, and only when we woman want it to be&quot; stage....

<em>&gt; Are you saying that illegal clones would not have the right to clone

</em><br>
<p>Being aborted does tend to eliminate a fetus' ability to procreate.

<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder if we might see anti-cloning technology that actually would work.
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; How is abortion going to protect you from being cloned? Are you going to

</em><br>
<p>Well, amnioscentisis (sp?) is capable of getting a DNA sample of a
<br>
fetus. It is conceivable that a mother would have to prove that a) they
<br>
are the genetic mother and have written consent of the genetic father to
<br>
allow the pregnancy to progress, or b) the mother has full writtent
<br>
consent of the DNA owner, which the medical staff is able to confirm
<br>
independently.
<br>
<p>This protocol could be instituted into medical ethics regs by state
<br>
licensing boards.
