[Charles Platt is senior writer for WIRED Magazine and an author and 
<br>
former science fiction editor when he's not enjoying his &quot;retirement&quot; 
<br>
in northern Arizona.  I don't know the answer to Charles' question, 
<br>
but perhaps my distinguished readers will?]

Subject: stem cell speech
<br>
<p>Matt, I am baffled that I have not read, anywhere, a suggestion from
<br>
anyone that George Bush has no constitutional right to set science policy.
<br>
His speech on stem cell research included a statement that he had decided
<br>
to proceed cautiously. How does he have the right to make such a decision?
<br>
Will there be an executive order?
<br>
<p>This in turn raises the question of how Congress has any right to tell
<br>
parents what they may or may not do with their zygotes. Control of federal
<br>
funding is one thing; but I sense a desire to go beyond that, and pass
<br>
legislation similar to the anti-cloning act which seems destined to become
<br>
law.
<br>
<p>Where's the constitutional excuse for this? In the tired old Interstate
<br>
Commerce Clause?
<br>
<p>I am not a lawyer or a constitutional scholar, so I may have missed
<br>
something here. But what troubles me the most is that I have seen no
<br>
commentators or op/ed writers raising the basic issue of control. Maybe I
<br>
just don't read the right news sources--or maybe everyone has become so
<br>
accustomed to centralized authority, extending all the way down to our own
<br>
genes, the spectacle of a president determining science policy rouses no
<br>
surprise.
