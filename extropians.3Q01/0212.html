--&gt;Behalf Of Brent Allsop
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;J. R. Molloy&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jr@shasta.com?Subject=RE:%20Debunk%20All%20Religiosity%20Equally%20(D.A.R.E.)&In-Reply-To=&lt;EPEELOAJBJFJPKFALCGKMEGPCBAA.reason@exratio.com&gt;">jr@shasta.com</a>&gt; answered why we should want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to &quot;debunk&quot; religion with:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Because we won't move into a better future until we defeat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; religiosity, which is the most regressive force now operating in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	To me, religion is simply &quot;a way of life&quot; so everyone has one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mine happens to be extropianism.
</em><br>
<p>I'd suggest that both religiosity (ok, you got me to go to m-w.com for that
<br>
one -- it still looks like it has too many 'i's...my parser must be broken)
<br>
in the theistic sense and substitutes (some improved, some not) such as
<br>
extropianism, et al, are all second order effects arising from a) fear of
<br>
mortality, b) being hierarchical creatures who are more comfortable in the
<br>
presence of defined rules, c) tending towards being too lazy to do anything
<br>
other than hide from and accept a) and b), d) fear of change, and e) the way
<br>
in which memes are selected and propagate.
<br>
<p>So without removing a, b, c, you're never going to be able to get rid of
<br>
religiosity of some form. d) seems to be the thing that's causing you
<br>
pain -- that's not exclusive to the religious, believe me. I don't think you
<br>
can do much about e).
<br>
<p>So back to my conclusion again (everything's just all about me :) -- getting
<br>
rid of a) will solve everyone's problems  :)
<br>
<p>Ok. Not being entirely serious there, but really: think about it. Religion
<br>
isn't the problem; it's a symptom of our quintessential apeness (hierarchy,
<br>
conditioning to rules, search for lost parents) and being unsure as to
<br>
whether we cease to exist when we die.
<br>
<p>Final thought: religion personal and religion organized are two very
<br>
different things. If you must judge, organized religions should probably be
<br>
judged in the same way that you would judge nationalities or countries.
<br>
Personal religion should be up the person in question...
