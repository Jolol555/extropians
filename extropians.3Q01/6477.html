<p>I don't agree: this is by _no_ means the entire story.
<br>
<p>I've been submerged for a few days, but yesterday I bolted together a 
<br>
lengthy analysis of the situation, as I see it. Here it is.

<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needed: a new age of enlightenment
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_________________________________________________________________
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now almost 48 hours since two airliners ploughed into the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World Trade Center, another dived onto the Pentagon, and a fourth
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came down near Pittsburgh.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'd think that every possible angle would already have been
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;covered by people writing about the events of September 11th. So
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why am I writing this, and why now?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in all the media coverage I've seen so far, nobody has been
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asking the right, the important, questions. Like: why did this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;happen, what circumstances got us into a de facto state of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;undeclared war with the Islamic world, and what can we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;realistically do to prevent those circumstances from ever
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recurring.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this essay I'm going to talk about three things:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* How we drifted into this situation over a period of fifty or more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* What will happen if we don't deal with the root causes of the mess
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* What we can do to fix things (apart from fighting a war)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
How did we get into this mess?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of you in the US are going to wonder why I, in the UK, am
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bothering with this. I'm 3000 miles away from New York, in a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country that wasn't directly affected; nevertheless the event is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;too overwhelming to bear. People around here have been walking
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around in shock, all around the world. This isn't simply an act of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrorism directed against the USA; it affects everyone,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world-wide. This event is going to be one of the defining political
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moments of the 21st century -- whether for good or for ill. (And
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there seems precious little scope for good in it right now.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand why it happened we have to go back to the 19th
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;century, or even earlier. And if we fail to understand its roots,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we run the risk of failing to prevent similar events from happening
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in future.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's get one thing straight, up-front: these atrocities did not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;happen just because a group of twenty fanatics decided to get on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;board some airliners, hijack them, and ram some of the most
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;significant buildings in the United States. Nor will going after
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their shadowy leaders stop this from happening again. Even a massed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thermonuclear strike on the Islamic world, followed by a campaign
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of genocide directed against a quarter of the world's population,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;won't stop this from happening again. This is a complex situation;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simplistic answers -- even drastic ones -- simply won't work.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what can we do?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we need to understand where the roots of the conflict are.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we need to be clear on where our own goals lie. Then, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only then, can we work out how to permanently end the conflict.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am convinced that it can be ended, for good, if our political
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaders have the guts to take the necessary measures.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
A long and bloody history
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I blame Richard the First, by grace of God King of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England and Wales.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I'm being a little unfair here; Richard Coer de Lion wasn't a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very bright fellow, and the Pope deserves a fairly large share of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the blame, as do all the other kings, princes, nobles and rag-tag
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Christendom who, in ten-ninety-something, decided to liberate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Holy Land. Except the word they used wasn't &quot;liberate&quot; and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freedom wasn't on their agenda.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crusades were a long, bloody, and unpardonably evil phase in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European history. They were also largely irrelevant, a sideshow:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except insofar as they gave rise to two abiding legacies. Firstly,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they fatally weakened the Eastern Roman Empire, and contributed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;directly to the fall of Constantinople. (This had good results as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well as ill; the diaspora of classical scholarship to western
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Europe, for example, contributed directly to the west's recovery
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the barbarism of the dark ages.) But secondly, the Crusades
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left a legacy of hate in the Islamic world. Stripped of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mythology of chivalry, the Crusades were perceived as barbarian
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;armies attacking the heartland of Islamic civilization every
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generation or so for a period of centuries.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't to say that the forces of Islam were innocent, either:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both great religions had, in those days, long-standing traditions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of waging evangelically-inspired holy wars on their perceived
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enemies. Nor were the crusades the only point of contact; the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conquest and re-conquest of Spain supplies ample evidence of this.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I'd like to make here is that the Islamic cultures of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;middle east have a traditional fear of the western Crusaders that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is as deeply rooted as the west's fear of Jihad.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
How Lawrence of Arabia screwed up
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's fast forward to world war one. The weakened Ottoman Empire
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Turkey uber alles) made the mistake of allying itself with the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central Powers -- Germany, the Hapsburg Empire, Italy. In one of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the more spectacular campaigns of a war noted for its bloody
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stalemate, the British expeditionary forces set the middle east
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ablaze and marched from Egypt north through Palestine, all the way
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the gates of Damascus in what today is Syria.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of fighting a world war, the British made a number
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of promises that today we have cause to regret. We'll skip the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balfour Declaration, which gave formal backing for a Jewish
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;homeland in the territories of trans-Jordanian Palestine. What
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;really matters is that the British incited the arab tribes and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nations of the region to rebel against their Ottoman rulers. In the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aftermath of the world war, everything went up for grabs. Colonel
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence's fanatical arab allies from the House of Saud were given
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arabia to rule; the civilized and enlightened former rulers of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arabia, the Hashemite monarchy, were unceremonially dumped in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fly-blown wastes of Palestine east of the river Jordan. Other rebel
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;groups were shored up in palaces around the middle east; the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdoms of Egypt, Persia, Lebanon, and Iraq were all established
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as British imperial puppet states.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(As an aside: we often forget that when, in the 1980's, Saddam
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hussein was sending his bombers to drop nerve gas on the marsh
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arabs of Iraq, he was merely implementing a policy proposed -- as a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means of policing that very area -- by Winston Churchill in 1919.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1945, after a second world war, Britain was essentially
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bankrupt. The United States government, as a matter of global
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policy, leaned on Britain to get rid of the empire; and the British
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;post-war government was in no position to refuse. The empire had,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in any case, outlived its usefulness; it was to be replaced by a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commonwealth, which would maintain the general trade structure of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the empire (with colonies grateful for their independence sending
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their raw materials to the motherland, in return for finished goods
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and engineering products that Britain could sell without
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;competition from other developed nations outside the institution).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One corollary of the decolonisation was that Israel, or Palestine,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or both, would gain independence. And this had implications outside
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its borders.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Israeli War of Independence ran from 1947-48 and was a pivotal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moment in the history of the middle east. To the Arab world it was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a re-run of the eleventh century; a Western crusader state had
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again appeared in their midst, hostile to their traditions and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;religion, claiming ownership of their holy places. It was an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affront to monarchies who had blithely assumed that the new state
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could be divided up and added to their territories, in the same way
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Poland was split between Prussia, Russia and the Hapsburg
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;empire at the close of the eighteenth century. It was an insult to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Islam, too, that their holy places would be under the thumb of a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreign invader.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, the war catalysed the downfall of the puppet
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;monarchies. One after another, the kingdoms of Iraq and Egypt and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lebanon and Syria fell. Only the Hashemite monarchy in Jordan --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;itself the survivor of seven centuries of court intrigue --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;survived. Iran embraced a very shaky constitutional monarchy, with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a democratically elected government; it was not to last. The US
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State Department, sensing a weakness in the wall around their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;communist enemies in Russia, backed a coup in Iran in 1953 that put
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reza Pahlavi on the peacock throne as a monarch-turned-dictator.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dominant revolutionary ideology in the muslim world in those
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days was ba'athism -- pan-arab socialism. Ba'athism was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modernizing, secularizing, but also centralizing and totalitarian
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by instinct. It grew in different directions in different
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;countries. In Syria and Egypt it played with socialism; in Iraq it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remained weak until an internal coup in the 1970's bought Saddam's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faction to power, at which point Iraqi Ba'athism acquired
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ideological overtones distinctly reminiscent of Hitler's Nazi party
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- with the concept of the &quot;new arab man&quot; dropped neatly into place
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the position Hitler reserved for his Aryan Germans.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, we see a distinct political progression:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decolonization by the Ottoman empire, recolonization by the British.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puppet monarchies installed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawl of British support. Arrival of a &quot;crusader state&quot; in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;region. Many monarchies fall to the first challenge.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise of progressive nationalist ideologies, mostly socialist.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise of US influence in the area, focussed obsessively on shoring up
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opposition to communism.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wars with Israel, fought over access to water. Western focus shifts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;towards securing the oil supply.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Ba'athism and the rise of fundamentalism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ba'athist movement was screwed before it even got started;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;socialism was a sure ticket onto the CIA's shit-list, as was any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attempt to exert unilateral control over their own oil reserves or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strategic assets such as the Suez canal. Israel could be used by the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;west as a proxy, like a knight on a chess board populated only by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pawns, to pin them down. Arab unification, a cause championed by every
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ba'athist movement, foundered on the rocks of every Ba'athist leader's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desire to be leader of the entire arab world.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Forget about Muammar Ghadaffi. Ghadaffi is the court jester of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle East, his ideology a mixture of progressive Islamic mysticism
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and second- hand anarcho-syndicalism. He's very much a child of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sixties, leader of a nation with a population smaller than Belgium and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;far less significant were it not for the oil reserves under his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;territory.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, some middle eastern kingdoms survived. The gulf emirates,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kuwait and the House of Saud are the main examples; phenomenally rich,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so rich that they can buy security no matter what the price. But,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surrounded by a sea of poor neighbours, their political aspirations
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blocked by external forces, their Ba'ath leadership corrupt and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;totalitarian, they live in fear.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure of Ba'athism -- the only genuine arab political ideology
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- left an ideological vacuum. One party states are loath to accept
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rival politics; thus, the only outlet for rage, disaffection, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desire for change lay in the direction of religion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which leads to a crucial insight: the rise of Islamic fundamentalism
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its linkage to resentment against the west is rooted in the moral
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bankruptcy of political processes in the middle east. This bankruptcy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is only partially self-inflicted; for example, by overthrowing a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;democracy in Iran in 1953, the CIA struck a devastating blow against
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their own long-term interests. But the Ba'ath parties did their best
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to help prevent any genuinely progressive or democratic movements
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;starting in the Middle East, and the west either stood aside or looked
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elsewhere because the Ba'ath were, if nothing else, tough on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;communism.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
The mess we're in
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads us to contemplate our current mess.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over three generations, the west has attempted to manipulate the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;politics of the middle east in support of two goals; anti-communism,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cheap oil. The former was accomplished by shoring up repressive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regimes that cracked down on communism -- unfortunately these same
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regimes cracked down on democratic institutions, too. The latter was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accomplished by using Israel as a catspaw to prevent any regional
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power from gaining too much control over the oil reserves. Israel
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot survive if the arab states unite under common leadership;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore Israel has a vested interest in preventing this situation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from arising.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of the political paralysis of the Ba'ath republics and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the post-colonial monarchies, radical islam offers the natives of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;region their only hope for a creed that calls to their interests. It
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is unfortunately a creed that sees the presence of Israel and the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;western machinations as signs that a crusade against Islam is in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;progress. That Islam has intermittently functioned as a beacon of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enlightenment -- and for many centuries was the most progressive and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;socially liberal religious realm in the world -- tends to be forgotten
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the west today. So, too, does the emphasis on certain features
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obscure the fact that progress can take place under Islam. Iran,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twenty years out of the terror of Khomenei's revolution, has acquired
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;democratic institutions far more liberal and enlightened than those of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any Ba'ath state; indeed, depending on the outcome of the current
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constitutional power struggle in Tehran, Iran may become the true
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;birthing ground for democracy in the Islamic world.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But right now, most people in the Islamic world feel disempowered and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unrepresented, their leaders corrupt tyrants who rule with the gun and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bullwhip at the pleasure of their western masters. They're poor,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the most part poorer than the poor who live in the collapsed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wreckage of the Soviet Union. And this is the perfect situation to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;breed suicide bombers.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
How do you want to live tomorrow?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a dream.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to see a world where the people of the middle east are not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poverty- stricken dwellers in concrete rubble and mud huts. I want to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see a world where they have democratically accountable governments, a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world where all their children go to school and then to university,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where there are two cars in every garage and a chicken in every pot. I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want to see a middle east where angry young adults with a political
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;point to make think in terms of writing to their elected
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;representatives, rather than strapping on bombs and committing suicide
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because that's the only way to make their voice heard.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who have freedom and wealth do not make good suicide bombers.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go ask the Japanese about it if you don't believe me and want a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first-hand opinion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, let's dwell on Japan. Japan is the perfect model for what I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want to see happening to the middle east. Japan's government was taken
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over by militaristic fanatics. They started a near-holy war. They got
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slapped down brutally hard, after they themselves committed appalling
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;atrocities in many other countries.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today ... Japan isn't perfect, but Japan is rich, comfortable,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;largely non-militaristic, overwhelmingly embarrassed about the past.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan is a poster-child for what I'd like the middle east to become,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the war that now looks to be inevitable.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to see a world where the people of the middle east don't see
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves as victims of a savage occupation by forces of a hostile
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evangelical religion bent on stripping them of their natural resources
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and keeping them divided.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most importantly, I want to see a world where we do not lose our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most precious liberties in the name of security and vigilance against
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a threat that should never have been allowed to materialise in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first place.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can be sure of one thing: if the threat of islamic terrorism isn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defeated, we will lose our liberties in the name of security.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assert that the terrorism emerges from frustration with the total
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corruption of the political processes of the middle east. Therefore,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to end the threat of terrorism we need to fix the political mess,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reconstruct the economies of the countries in the region, and provide
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the circumstances in which an islamic equivalent of the west's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eighteenth century enlightenment can flourish.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we get there from here?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can, but I am not confident that our leaders have the will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to do so.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
An unpalatable prescription
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who thinks that a simple revenge raid will solve anything is so
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;utterly misguided it's almost pointless trying to engage with them. As
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've outlined above, the roots of this mess go back too far for any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simple nostrum to cure them. Revenge may make people feel better for a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;few hours ... but in the long years ahead, it will only make the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;darkness deeper.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The myth of the crusader states must be broken, once and for all; the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;islamic world needs convincing proof that the west is not bent of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;breaking them to baptism by force. As long as even some of them
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe that this is a holy war, it will be a holy war.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, they need convincing proof that the west is not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soft. The west is not going to bend its neck before revolutionary
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fundamentalist Islam. But, from people who take Islam for granted with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same fervour that Americans take to church, this is going to be a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hard-won concession. There's a very fine dividing line between a firm
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response and brutality, and the west already has the reputation of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being a bully in the region. If all that military intervention
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;achieves is to shore up that perception, then that use of force is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counter- productive.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly, and as a first step that we can take right now, we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;need to understand our own core values and goals, and stop funding
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organisations and individuals who don't share our goals.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osama bin Laden got his training and much of his money in the 1980's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the CIA. Saddam Hussein bought arms from the west at a discount
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to prosecute his war with the demon du jour, Khomenei. The Shah -- a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brutal, blood-soaked tyrant -- bought F-14's for his air force and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenger tanks for his army.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For how much longer are our institutions -- the British Foreign
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Office, the US State Department, and others -- going to dine with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these devils?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of September 11th are almost inevitably going to lead to a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shooting war. It's too late to avoid that, now. But it's time to start
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thinking right now about what we're going to do after the war is won.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war ... we need to ensure that the Islamic world is not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;further disempowered. Disempowerment works at an individual level;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remember, the Islamic world, like the west, consists of hundreds of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;millions of thinking, feeling, human beings. As in the west, a small
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but significant minority is inclined to address problems with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;violence. Unlike the west, the lack of effective political outlets has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;served to radicalize many who would otherwise be content to deal with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;democratic institutions. Give them other outlets, effective and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accountable political mechanisms, and many of those who currently are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;driven to violence will find more constructive, peaceful outlets.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But curing disempowerment, and the violence it brings, is only part of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the solution. To achieve a real permanent settlement, we must do
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing short of laying the foundations for an historic change in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Islamic world -- a change comparable to the Age of Enlightenment that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swept the Christian world in the eighteenth century.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Enlightenment was the pivotal moment in the ascent of the west. It
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the philosophical period from which our current cultural values
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;derive; the religious and philosophical foundations of liberty, human
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rights, the legitimization of democracy, and republicanism, all have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their roots in this astonishing and remarkable period.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Enlightenment, the west was dominated by monarchies,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deriving their theory of rights from the Divine Right of Kings. There
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was no other legitimate power source other than the Church; the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alternative to tyranny was theocracy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Enlightenment, life in the west has not been a bed of roses
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- but there has always been an alternative to tyranny. Christian
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fundamentalism (or rather, totalitarian fundamentalism) is still a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;besetting problem, but it is not the only option.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can create the preconditions for a free, liberal, wealthy,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;democratic middle east, and if we can somehow break the cycle of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hatred and holy war, we may be able to build an environment in which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more enlightened, liberal politics can grow. If that happens, the risk
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a repeat of September 11th happening will be vastly reduced.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we fail to fix the root causes of the struggle -- the inability
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the moslem world to make its voice heard by non-violent means, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the inability of people living in that sphere to engage in what we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider to be normal political discourse -- this incident will come
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back to haunt us. And we stand to lose our own enlightenment values.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing undermines civil liberties as brutally as paranoia; if we fail
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to treat the root causes of terrorism, we will lose our rights an inch
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at a time, in the name of collective security
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shouldn't be seen as a war against terrorism; rather, it's an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opportunity to extend to the rest of the world the lessons the west
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;learned in the eighteenth century.
