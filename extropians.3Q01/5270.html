<em>&gt; &gt; If Newton had called it 'electromagnetic attraction', he would have

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand the attack on Kuhn.  What is it in Kuhn (presumably &quot;The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;) that you connect to a &quot;delusion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical laws are created by people&quot;?  My reading of Kuhn was that it takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time for people (even scientists) to accept a fundamental change in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of how reality works.  I didn't think he had said that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world hadn't changed until the consensus had settled on the new view.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with your &quot;reading of Kuhn that it takes time for people
<br>
to accept...&quot;, but Kuhn minimalize the importance of physical
<br>
reality on our theories:  Here is what Steven Weinberg says about
<br>
Kuhn in this context:
<br>
<p>&quot;In his celebrated book...Kuhn went a step further and argued that in scientific
<br>
revolutions the standards by which scientists judge theories change, so that the new
<br>
theories simply cannot be judged by the pre-Revolutionary standards.  There is much in
<br>
Kuhn's book that fits my [Weinberg's] own experience in science.  But in the last chapter
<br>
Kuhn tentatively attacked the view that science makes progress toward objective truths:
<br>
&quot;We may, to be more precise, have to relinquish the notion, explicit or implicit, that
<br>
changes of paradigm carry scientists and those who learn from them closer and closer to
<br>
the truth.&quot;  Kuhn's book lately seems to have become read (or at least quoted) as a
<br>
manifesto for a general attack on the presumed objectivity of science.&quot;
<br>
<p>I thought S.W. said more;  but in any case, that explains where Mike
<br>
was coming from, because what Kuhn is saying, even if he didn't mean
<br>
to, is that the theories are changing just due to people and societies.
