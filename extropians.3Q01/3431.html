[...snip a very long list...]
<br>
<p>The problem is that the tests look for an immune response rather than for
<br>
the viruses themselves among other things.  This is a general problem for
<br>
viral diseases in particular.
<br>
<p>This is why Chiron's (CHIR) Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) technology platform
<br>
(Procleix), which is expected to receive FDA approved later this year is a
<br>
considered to be a major advancement.  Chiron's NAT technology will be the
<br>
first general purpose platform that is capable of directly detecting the
<br>
presence of viruses in the body.  The initial shipping targets will be HIV
<br>
and HCV (for testing blood supplies primarily), but could theoretically be
<br>
configured to sniff out just about any foreign nucleic acid signature in the
<br>
body as I understand it.
<br>
<p>The primary benefit of this technology is that it is extremely sensitive and
<br>
that you can detect a viral infection much earlier than previously possible.
<br>
Note that the NAT platform is already in use in the U.S. and elsewhere for
<br>
blood diagnostics as it is considered an extraordinarily important
<br>
capability, it just isn't FDA approved, so Chiron isn't allowed to make any
<br>
money yet.  Final approval is expected in September or October of this year.
<br>
<p>So that sort of answers your question.  NAT should effectively eliminate
<br>
false positives AND false negatives for HIV (and other viruses) in the body.
