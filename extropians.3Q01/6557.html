Someone named Greg Johnson wrote:

<em>&gt; Jason Walker is mistaken. I do not think that the United States should give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one inch to terrorism WHEN OUR INTERESTS AND PRINCIPLES ARE AT STAKE. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America has no interest in being allied with Israel. Nor do we have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant commonality of values. Israel is more like the hated Muslim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries than like the United States.
</em><br>
<p>One of the biggest differences, of course, is that Israel is a democracy.
<br>
You may not like Sharon, Begin, Shamir, etc., but they were elected
<br>
by their people.  There are multiple competing parties and legitimate
<br>
campaigns.  Few if any of the arab countries can make the same claim.
<br>
<p>Furthermore Israel does share a great many cultural values with the United
<br>
States and with the West in general.  It was, after all, populated by
<br>
people who had lived in the West for centuries.  If Israel has turned
<br>
to violence and harsh treatment of its enemies, it is a cultural trait
<br>
that we all share.  Who thinks that the US will be any different, any
<br>
more humane, in our response to this terrorism?
