</em><br>
<p>Ah, but you are assuming that because NH doesn't have a huge welfare
<br>
system that it offers poor quality services to those in poverty. It
<br>
doesn't, and is generally considered to have some of the better
<br>
services, though it is generally targeted toward steering people toward
<br>
training or employment. What NH does have is a time delay barrier that
<br>
helps prevent much of other state's poverty from being imported here.
<br>
<p>Because of the relative lack of business regulation and low taxes (no
<br>
income or sales tax), we attract business, which leads to employment.
<br>
This results in low poverty rates, which results in small social
<br>
services budgets and therefore low taxes are maintained.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This argument has a basic flaw.  I don't know about the relative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiecies, I see information for both sides.  I do know that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people tend to move to where they can live, rather than die.  (New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hampshire may not be that strict, but I don't live there, so I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you aren't sure of a warm place at night, you'ld clearly better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be somewhere else.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you can propose some other direct causal link, then I would like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hear it.  (Theories must provide relevant and checkable facts.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This doesn't speak at all to good or bad.  To my mind one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destructive actions of the supreme court was to strike down the
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; some things just aren't possible.
</em><br>
<p>Don't know what you are talking about here. We certainly do have a
<br>
residency requirement for social services beyond some very basic
<br>
assistance.
