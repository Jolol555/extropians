<br>
<p><em>&gt; I tend to agree with Kurzweil, that the fate of the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be decided, not by the weak nuclear force, the strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force, electromagnetism, or even gravity, but by intelligence;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which the other four forces crumble in the face of.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know of anyone who said this before Tipler in &quot;The
<br>
Anthropic Cosmological Principle&quot;, in 1986.  Kurzweil shouldn't
<br>
get any credit for this observation.  Some excerpts from Tipler
<br>
and Barrow's 1986 book:
<br>
<p>&quot;To say that intelligent life has some global cosmological
<br>
significance is to say that intelligent life will begin to
<br>
transform the Universe on a cosmologial scale.&quot; (p.615).
<br>
<p>&quot;...Finally, the time is reached when life has encompassed
<br>
the entire Universe and regulated all matter contained
<br>
therein.  Life begins to manipulate the dynamical evolution
<br>
of the universe as a whole...&quot;   (p. 675)
<br>
<p>and in the intervening pages he presents many detailed 
<br>
arguments, including a suggestion that the evidence is
<br>
*weakly* indicating that the universe is closed.

<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; I should point out that the cosomology has moved on from this one -- poor
<br>
&nbsp;Tipler outlined a great and moving final resurrection analogy (pretty
<br>
&nbsp;similar to Greg Bear's storyline in Eternity, funnily enough, small
<br>
&nbsp;universe), but the cosmological underpinnings of his model were pulled out
<br>
&nbsp;from under his feet within twelve months of publication.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Insofar as we can say anything about the future behavior of the universe,
<br>
&nbsp;the big crunch seems to be an increasingly outside bet. Long, cold, dark and
<br>
&nbsp;isotropic is the current forerunner...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;...not that we don't get to experience a subjective eternity in either case.
<br>
&nbsp;It's a funny old world.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Reason &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>As you did note-its merely the current forerunner, on the other hand, other 
<br>
astronomers and cosmologists have come to see an accelerated expansion as a 
<br>
fairly recent thing. There is also counter theories, based on the same 
<br>
observations that suggest frequent expansions and partial collapses. 
<br>
Physicist Larry Krauss at Case Western University has suggested that we'll 
<br>
never know the fate of the universe. Baring that, I tend to agree with 
<br>
Kurzweil, that the fate of the universe will be decided, not by the weak 
<br>
nuclear force, the strong force, electromagnetism, or even gravity, but by 
<br>
intelligence; in which the other four forces crumble in the face of.
