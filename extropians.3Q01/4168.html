</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; made sure that my data shadow does not look like me:

<em>&gt; Some of the things you list, such as not having bank accounts or credit

<p>Carrying cash is easy, so long as you have a gun.... ;)
<br>
I've been working as a consultant for four years now without a bank
<br>
account. I make sure customers write me checks from banks that I have
<br>
access to, so I have no problem cashing them, and after repeated visits,
<br>
they stop asking for ID, since they recognise my face, they assume they
<br>
'know' me (small towns are nice this way).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only reason I can think of not to allow oneself into various databases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that one might someday need to hide from someone who has access to such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; databases. But maybe there are other reasons I'm missing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If one wishes to maintain a degree of anonymity to leave open the option of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hiding, it would seem to make more sense to develop one or more alternative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identities one could step into if the need should arise. Refusing to produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ID cards, insisting on using cash for large purchases and so forth draw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention to a person rather than protecting their anonymity.
</em><br>
<p>Which is why having an alternate identity is very useful. Use the
<br>
alternate identity in your financial transactions, so any inquisition by
<br>
the man results in &quot;Who ME? No, I'm not him, you must want that other
<br>
guy.&quot; (or vice versa)
