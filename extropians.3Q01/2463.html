<em>&gt; As a side note, Adobe has no right to drop charges against Sklyarov.  This

</em><br>
<em>&gt; decides on their prosecution strategy.  The so-called victim (Adobe) has no

</em><br>
<p><p>I disagree.  Adobe claimed to have been wronged by its
<br>
encryption technique being broken.  If Adobe no longer believes
<br>
it was so wronged or that the accused is the party that should
<br>
be prosecuted that should have some bearing.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If we have a beef with the company he works for in general then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we should take that up with the company instead of locking away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one of its employees on trumped up charges.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The so-called beef is a law which makes it illegal to break encryption.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be a bad law.  However, as it is written, it is Sklyarov who broke the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encryption.  The company that employs him and distributes his program did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not break this law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There is no &quot;may be&quot; about it.  Sklyarov is a foreign national. 
<br>
I was not aware (and I certainly have no expertise here so help
<br>
me out) that foreigners are subject to US laws.  The type of
<br>
encryption policies practiced by Adobe and supported by DMCA are
<br>
actually in part illegal in Sklyarov's country.  He did his work
<br>
at his company's bidding and in part as a good citizen of Russia
<br>
and in conformance with Russian laws.  I had thought that there
<br>
were procedures that are a bit different if a country wants to
<br>
bring charges against a non-citizen.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Lastly, do not call people who do cyber breaking and enterning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;hackers&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry.  I agree with your implied point that hacking is not necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; related to criminal behavior.  Running a tool downloaded from the Internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not really hacking in any sense of the word.
</em><br>
<p><p>Hacking is not about breaking into anyone's systems.  &quot;Cracking&quot;
<br>
would be a better term.  The media has abused this term where we
<br>
&quot;hackers&quot; stand a much better chance of being misunderstood and
<br>
even subject to persecution as a result.  I have been a &quot;hacker&quot;
<br>
for 22 years but I have never yet broken into a computer system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This &quot;encryption&quot; is so asinine and childish that a 12 year old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could break it without hardly trying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed.  That is why they need laws to prevent people from doing it.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encryption itself is not good enough to deter anybody.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, to the extent it should be done.  The questions and issues
<br>
should be debated publicly more.  As Lawrence Lessig has
<br>
written, enforcing limitations on others in code takes the level
<br>
and kind of limitations out of the public forum and makes room
<br>
for much more draconian control and limitation than would pass
<br>
the law making process.  The DMCA is bad law because it makes it
<br>
legal for any and all such schemes to be implemented, to go
<br>
unquestioned and makes it illegal to circumvent or even
<br>
reverse-engineer in order to understand such encoded
<br>
restrictions. 
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is also offered in conformance with &quot;fair use&quot; which Adobe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; e-books and other closed systems today would deny by enforcing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different set of common law in the code itself which everyone is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then forbiddent to reverse-engineer or contravene.  This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; huge threat to all of us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure this blocks fair use.  People still must pay for books.  When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you borrow a book from a library for free, it is because the library paid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for it.  Adobe is trying to develop a method to ensure payment.  I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure I see how enforcing payment threatens fair use of copyrighted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materials.  I am probably missing your point as to what is threatening about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But I can do far more with a book than I can do with heavily
<br>
copy protected and use restricted e-books and other similar
<br>
material.  In code I can restrict the number of times the book
<br>
is read, by whom it is read, the time period it is readable in,
<br>
what it can be read with, whether it can be copied or excerpted
<br>
at all and any number of other things that it is not possible
<br>
and judged quite undesirable to do with normal books.  
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Are you arguing against the concept of copyrights in general?  That is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicated topic, about which I have still not finalized my position.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hate the idea of patents which limit the use of a great idea.  
</em><br>
<p>Patent is a totally different animal from copyright.  Algorithms
<br>
and thus software at one time was considred unpatentable much as
<br>
a mathematical proof is unpatentable.  But the entire patent
<br>
question is a large topic best left for some other time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;However, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't see how inventors would get paid without them.  The same is true for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copyrights.  I hate the idea that a freely-copyable resource is artificially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited, but I don't know how artists and writers would get paid without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforcing payment.  I admit that I have not researched this enough, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore I am not sure what the best answer should be.
</em><br>
<p>Paying the producers of music, books, software and so on for
<br>
their work is a separable issue from restricting the utility and
<br>
availability of that work in ways that actually lessen its value
<br>
to us all.  
<br>
<p>I don't have a full position either but I know the current
<br>
situation is robbing us of the full value of what we and others
<br>
create.
