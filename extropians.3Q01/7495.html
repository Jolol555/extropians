<em>&gt; Einstein On War

<p>God on Einstein:
<br>
<p>=====================================================
<br>
Einstein, Heisenberg, and Tipler
<br>
by John Walker
<br>
9th August 1995

<p>Einstein, Heisenberg, and Tipler, after equal invariant intervals in
purgatory, find themselves before the Throne of God.
<p>As a man, they exclaim, &quot;What did I do to merit an eternity down
(brrrrr)
there&quot;?
<p>God thought for a moment; when you're omnipresent in spacetime there's
no
need for haste. He turned first to Einstein.
<p>&quot;Albert,&quot; he said, &quot;you showed your species My creation in its most
elegant
form, law without Law. Then, inflamed by wartime passion, you urged the
transformation of your discovery into a weapon of mass destruction.&quot;
<p>Einstein shuffled his feet and nodded subtly. He resisted the temptation
to
stick his tongue out. God turned His omniscient Eyes toward Heisenberg.
<p>&quot;Werner, you discovered that I do play dice, and you glimpsed that I
have to
if anything interesting's going to happen--your last words were, `I will
ask
Him why there is turbulence'. I will answer you, `So there can be
Heisenberg'. But you stayed in Germany, Werner! You worked on a reactor
for
Hitler; you taught physics to brown-shirted Nazi thugs. You'll recall
that
my Son is Jewish.&quot;
<p>&quot;Frank, Frank, Frank,&quot; God continued, &quot;didn't you read my book? I read
yours, you know. Does the phrase `Thou shalt have no other gods before
me'
ring a bell? How about `I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and
the
ending'? You not only wanted to have another God before Me, you wanted
to be
Him. And the money, Frank...do you know how piddling an advance I got
for
the Bible?. And you assumed causality--you Frank! You should know me
better
than that.&quot;
<p>Tipler, almost defiant, raised his head and fixed God with a cold stare.
&quot;Why are there singularities in Your universe?&quot;
<p>&quot;Because there are things I don't want you to know,&quot; God responded
calmly.
<p>Heisenberg, his dying question answered, remained silent, pondering the
choices he'd made during his life on Earth.
<p>Einstein seized the moment, &quot;Look, Old One&quot;, he said, &quot;physics is local.
You
made it that way; I figured it out. But why is there that spooky
action-at-a-distance nonlocality in quantum mechanics?&quot;
<p>God chuckled. Even experiencing all of spacetime at once, such events
were
rare. &quot;Albert, your greatest talent has always been not finding the
right
answer--anybody could do that--but asking the right question. Your
generation learned physics assuming I was a great watchmaker; you
destroyed
that notion, but most of you died off before it became evident what I
was. I
create abstract systems from pure information, Albert. I'm a programmer.
<p>&quot;Quantum nonlocality is a bug.&quot;
<p>God turned to Saint Peter. &quot;Einstein and Heisenberg go to Heaven. Send
Tipler to the massive rotating cylinder to try again. Next case.&quot;
<p>God hated these Judgement Days; he couldn't wait (to the extent that's
possible for an omnipresent being) to get to back to his craps game with
Wotan, Jove, and Shiva. Saint Peter looked up from his infinite scroll,
&quot;Fourth Commandment: blasphemy--eternal damnation. Send in Lederman and
Hawking&quot;.
<p>What was it about these physicists, God wondered, as they approached the
Throne.
