<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the same way the average Westerner does: by finding passages that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be appropriately interpreted to mean the opposite of others.  Any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture --Western, Muslim or otherwise-- that bases its beliefs almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solely on the writings of a single book can not make *any* rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justifications whatsoever, so long as they are guided by religion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The primary difference I have detected between the way Western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization conducts itself and the way Muslim etc. conducts itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that the former claims to have religious imperative but seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make the most rational choice regardless of that claim.  Eastern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religions tend to have much more of a narrow focus which their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proponents adhere to more strictly.  I don't see this as a problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the books (Bible vs. Koran, Bhagavad Gita etc.) so much as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem with the narrowness of interpretation...and such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation, as you mention, has formed some Eastern cultural law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Actually both Hinduism and Buddhism have led to much more peaceful cultures
<br>
and a great deal earlier than Christianity did.  So it is not an Eastern vs.
<br>
Western thing.  
<br>
<p>I think it is more of a young and bloody culture wrenched into the 20th century
<br>
kind of problem.  While there were and are many areas of great culture in the
<br>
region there were also other areas predominated by warring tribes of largely
<br>
nomadic people.  Such cultures do not have a developmental basis for building
<br>
modern peaceful secular states even without religion.  Islam is often praised,
<br>
and rightly, for bringing more peace and stability to such cultures than they
<br>
had ever experienced before.  But that does not mean these cultures are ready
<br>
and able to leap into post-Enlightenment mindsets and socio-political structures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;   How can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;democracy flourish in cultures where a religion based on that scripture is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;enshrined in law? These are the hard questions that our contemporary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cultural relativism apparently makes it impossible to ask.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think that democracy *can* flourish in those countries without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widespread cultural assimilation.  It brings up the more difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question of whether people are more willing to quell culture for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sake of politics or quell politics for the preservation of culture.
</em><br>
<p>Why are people intent on preserving that which does not work?
