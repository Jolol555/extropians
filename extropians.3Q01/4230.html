<p>An interesting observation. But I wonder if it is true?
<br>
<p>What is the underlying philosophical issues? I think it has to do
<br>
with the new information ontology that is emerging from computer
<br>
science, the neo-Darwinian synthesis in biology, genomics,
<br>
cognitive neuroscience and perhaps even the economy-as-information
<br>
ideas that seem to follow from the Austrian school. In this
<br>
ontology or paradigm, what matters is information and how it is
<br>
processed. While it might not be deliberately functionalist, it
<br>
has a functionalist flair to it, and it has the usual scientific
<br>
acceptance of interdisciplinary approaches.
<br>
<p>What would the corresponding literary paradigm be? To me it seems
<br>
to be the postmodern paradigm, but maybe that is too narrow?
<br>
<p>Perhaps the important thing is the allegiance of the scientific
<br>
culture to an objective world; even the most elusive concepts in
<br>
quantum mechanics or information theory are deep down something
<br>
objective. That they can be viewed in many arbitrary ways doesn't
<br>
mean that wave functions or entropies are arbitrary in themselves.
<br>
Compare this to the far more subjective approach found in literary
<br>
circles, where the intertextual relationships are more important. 
<br>
<p>Any thoughts?
