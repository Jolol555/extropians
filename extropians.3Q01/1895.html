<p><em>&gt;&gt; With the Singularity so close, why would you tell someone to save
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; money, work hard (even when they don't feel like it), and educate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; themselves (even when they don't want to)?  I'll bet that you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reasons!  But they can retort &quot;now there is a GMI---so I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; *have* to do any of those things, right?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hell.  You do the learning stuff because it is fun and stretches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the brain.  Especially when you aren't under threat of getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economically crushed if you don't study what the market will pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for rather than what truly makes your heart sing.
</em><br>
<p>Now I warned you about this before: you are seriously, seriously
<br>
projecting your values on to others.  Try going to a high school,
<br>
and telling the kids that &quot;learning is fun and stretches the brain&quot;,
<br>
(as if they'd never heard that before) and that you'll be available
<br>
in the public library for some real cool learning sessions all
<br>
during the first week of summer.  Don't be surprised, Samantha,
<br>
if your appeals aren't as succcessful as the attractions of
<br>
movies, the beach, battlebots and World Wide Wrestling.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; You still have not answer my earlier question:  how much money
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; do you think that your U.S. government will have to spend on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 200,000,000 adults in the U.S. to provide the GMI?  Remember also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are mixing apples and oranges.  GMI is not the same as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeding everyone on earth.
</em><br>
<p>How did feeding everyone on Earth get into this?  My question 
<br>
is very specific, and anyone who proposes a GMI (maybe we aren't
<br>
both talking about a Guaranteed Minimal Income?) should either
<br>
answer it, or defer an answer until he has more information
<br>
or better ideas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; that we have now learned (thanks to Chris Rauch this morning 10:01am)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that about one-fourth of the populace would quit working within a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; year, and that many more might have less incentive to work if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; **thought** that a lot of lazy people were getting a free ride?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hate to break this to you but we don't need one fourth of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population working fulltime with the level of automation we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have.
</em><br>
<p>Oh that's all right.  I can handle it :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At least that many are doing make-work effectively because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can figure out how people can have any dignity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable income otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>Stranger and stranger.  Who is this &quot;we&quot;?  Now in some
<br>
times and countries, there were people in charge, but
<br>
in America and many other countries, we have simply 
<br>
inherited a system (a capitalist, free-market system
<br>
for the most part).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; In the meantime what?  Starvation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Do you have any idea of how many people each year starve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to death in the U.S.?   Hint: do you think that it reaches
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the newspapers when an elderly person trapped in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; apartment actually does?  About how many children in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; U.S. starve to death each year?  Is the GMI really needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to prevent starvation?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; That was not the question.
</em><br>
<p>I was just asking.  Sorry. But you had brought up the spectre
<br>
of people starving.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The question is, what do you propose as more people simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't needed in a modern hi-tech economy?   How do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propose to handle the problem?
</em><br>
<p>Good question!  So far, in America we haven't seen much 
<br>
&quot;structural unemployment&quot; lead to true unemployment, I think.
<br>
The economy seems to &quot;need&quot; people to work at all levels,
<br>
doesn't it?  That is, I know that there is a great demand for
<br>
software engineers and also a great demand for unskilled
<br>
(backbreaking) labor.  I know, one can say that &quot;we&quot; should
<br>
engineer things better, but as I said before, in America
<br>
there is no such &quot;we&quot;.  (of course, Come the Revolution... :-)
