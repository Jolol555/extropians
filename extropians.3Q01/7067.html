<p>
I've been wading through the posts on this list for the last week, most
<br>
filled with the heady opinions of armchair warriors (dove and hawk alike),
<br>
while keeping my opinions on the matters of the world to myself.  But
<br>
instead of offering my opinion on the terrorism incident, I'm going to give
<br>
my opinion of this list's opinions in a general sort of way.
<br>
<p><p>This list has totally lost its perspective.  As extropians, who *do* have a
<br>
long-term agenda last I checked, there are two ways to address this
<br>
particular threat, a threat that is far more complicated than any simple
<br>
analysis will solve anyway.  The first way is to eliminate it in an
<br>
offensive fashion, actively destroying it so that it has minimal ability to
<br>
damage us.  The second is a defensive mode, minimizing the ability of the
<br>
threat to harm us if it chooses to engage us.  But like in so many things,
<br>
reality decides these things for us by and large.
<br>
<p>The reality is that extropians have no real business discussing offensive
<br>
measures because, quite frankly, extropians have negligible impact on the
<br>
massive engine of inertia that is government policy, particularly with
<br>
issues like this.  The world turns as the world turns.  Offering platitudes
<br>
as to who/what/when/where should be attacked in the Middle East is nothing
<br>
more than emotional masturbation, and offers nothing constructive that could
<br>
be construed as defending an extropian future.  I could get this on a dozen
<br>
other sites, and the quality would be better in some cases.  There *is* some
<br>
causality at work here; if extropians actually had something of substantial
<br>
value to add in this regard then they might also be in a position to
<br>
influence it.  But from where I sit, we are often indistinguishable from a
<br>
high-rise yuppie or a trailer park yokel, value-wise.
<br>
<p>Which leads me to my second point: hunkering down and spending our time on
<br>
things that matter.  If we can agree that as individuals and as a group we
<br>
can not effectively and rationally attack this particular threat to an
<br>
extropian future, then it is imperative that we think of how to accomplish
<br>
our goals in the shadow of great threats (and the forces that counter them)
<br>
for which we have limited preemptive offensive capabilities.  And by
<br>
&quot;rationally&quot;, I mean taking a long-term view with your ultimate goals in
<br>
mind.  This is a far more constructive approach for a number of reasons.
<br>
First of all, it is relatively easy for an individual to ensure their
<br>
survival and the perpetuation of their goals.  Second, the passive nature of
<br>
these measures take little focus away from our primary goals.  Third,
<br>
security and safety is a network effect; the people around you are safer for
<br>
your individual effort and may reciprocate.
<br>
<p>My last and most important point is that extropians are in the business of
<br>
creating the ultimate trump cards, technologies that can permanently render
<br>
the threats we are facing obsolete.  There are escalating issues and
<br>
competing forces today which threaten to severely blunt our goals, thereby
<br>
rendering us helpless to stop even greater threats than those which most
<br>
people think about.  The endgame is upon us, and we are in a race against
<br>
those that would stop us; if we fail or even slow down too much, we will die
<br>
eventually.  My goal in surviving isn't to survive another day, but to win
<br>
the game.  Destroying terrorism isn't a win, but merely a draw; spending
<br>
effort doing so in no way ensures my long-term survival and may indeed
<br>
hamper it.  It is therefore imperative that energy be devoted to actual
<br>
solving the problems that we can solve rather than pissing in the wind over
<br>
short-term issues that are largely beyond our control.  In the long run,
<br>
maximizing productivity towards our goals is the winning strategy, not
<br>
engaging in brush fires, even big ones, that would be cheaper to avoid.
<br>
Even if we can solve some problems it doesn't mean doing so is an effective
<br>
use of effort and resources given a particular set of goals and a very
<br>
finite quantity of time.
<br>
<p>If I die, it will be of precious little comfort to me that everyone else
<br>
died first.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>-James Rogers
