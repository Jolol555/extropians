<em>&gt; &gt; The mistake is in thinking that we are continuous. We aren't. We

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Continuity is provided by association with the same body that you went to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;the burden of continuity on the corpus.
</em><br>
<p>I am a regime of thought patterns and memories, a set of actions performed. 
<br>
My body (including the physical brain) has only the most tenuous and 
<br>
coincidental connection with that. My body is one of the things that helps 
<br>
provide the illusion of continuity, but it has little to do with my feeling 
<br>
that I am me.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; If my biological self died in her sleep one night and next day my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; downloaded self awoke, then in what way have I not continued? I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would still remember what went before in exactly the same way I do each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; morning of my biological life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But it wouldn't be you -- it would be a copy of you; a separate person
</em><br>
<em>&gt;associated with a different corpus who just happens to be very similar to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the (now extinct) you.
</em><br>
<p>The you now is 'only' a very similar copy of yesterday's you that was 
<br>
started up this morning. You are taking objectivity to an absurd level (I 
<br>
mean that technically -- I am not intending to flame you).
<br>
<p>Look at the situation subjectively for a moment and you can see the reality 
<br>
of the situation: I go to sleep. I wake with all my thoughts, memories, and 
<br>
emotions intact, but inside a virtual world. I no longer have a body in the 
<br>
physical sense, but I can see and walk and talk like I could last night. It 
<br>
is still me. The consciousness that was the broad set of actions performed 
<br>
by the organic brain (before it died) is now being performed by a computer 
<br>
inside a virtual world.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I find belief in the indentity of two copies to be a risky hypothesis.
</em><br>
<p>You are talking in ideals and absolutes, but in the real world things are 
<br>
not so clear-cut. This is where our discussion doesn't quite meet. I am 
<br>
speaking practically. I am happy to rely upon a backup of my brain to carry 
<br>
my thoughts, feelings and memories into the future, as my parents are happy 
<br>
to use their children for that, and I used to think I would have to rely 
<br>
upon my artwork and writing.
<br>
<p>Yes, in some sense the backup is not *exactly* the same person as before, 
<br>
but considering the changes I go through every day, I think it is a trivial 
<br>
difference.
<br>
<p>The actual recording of a backup may be risky, perhaps. But so is trying to 
<br>
replace your brain bit by bit, hoping nothing goes awry in the process. In 
<br>
the replacement scenario you are tampering with the only brain you have, 
<br>
and a healthy one at that! The other way is *much* safer -- you get backups 
<br>
that can be checked for accuracy and finally activated upon your biological 
<br>
brain's expiry.
<br>
<p>The two are not even exclusive. I can imagine that if the replacement was 
<br>
proven to me to be totally safe I would have it done... but I would also 
<br>
want backups in case the replaced me just happened to walk in front of a 
<br>
bus accidentally.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;there's no verifiable way to prove that that the essential you will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continue if you peform some sort of radical cut-and-paste operation like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the one described above.
</em><br>
<p>Kinda true, but there is no verifiable way to prove that the you who woke 
<br>
this morning is the same one that went to sleep. And I am not being cute 
<br>
here. There are occasions when people have strokes in their sleep and wake 
<br>
with significantly altered brains. Are they the same person? It depends 
<br>
largely on how you define sameness... and that easily becomes a matter of 
<br>
playing with words.
<br>
<p>Also I think you are harking back to the same mistake of thinking that the 
<br>
illusion of continuity is a real phenomenon when you say &quot;the essential you&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  The only way to see is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to try it -- which will either kill you or not. I'd much rather stick with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continuity through association with a given chunk of (slowly changing)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;matter -- at least I know I'm not doing anything there that will wind up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;causing me to cease to exist.
</em><br>
<p>Heheheh :-)
<br>
Both options carry risks. Though I can't help thinking that mucking around 
<br>
with the only copy of my brain is much more dangerous -- there is no 
<br>
fall-back position there. But I gotta say, if it turned out to be quite 
<br>
safe I would certainly go for it.
<br>
<p>Both options are infinitely less risky than the third option: dying.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
