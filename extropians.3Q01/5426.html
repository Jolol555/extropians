<p><p><em>&gt;I am just curious as to why you would prefer american citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have jobs more then mexican citizens, or chinese citizens.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are all people, and they all have children and loved ones to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;support.  Why do Americans deserve this more then foriegners?  Is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it also important to you that we perpetuate the economic imbalance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between post industrialized nations and 3rd world nations? (keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us rich and them poor) because that is what you are essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;encouraging.
</em><br>
<p>I have nothing against either Mexican or Chinese citizens having
<br>
jobs. (although I have a big problem with the Chinese government
<br>
these days).
<br>
<p>I of course never said they deserve this more than others, I favor
<br>
globalization.
<br>
<p>Let me quote criminologist Gary Kleck and author David Kopel.
<br>
<p>&quot;Fixating on guns seems to be, for many people,a fetish which
<br>
allows them to ignore the more intransigient causes of American
<br>
violence, including it's dying cities, inequality, deteriorating
<br>
family structure, and the all-pervasive economic and social
<br>
consequences of a history of slavery and racism.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;All Parties to the crime debate would do well to give more
<br>
concentrated attention to the more difficult, but far more
<br>
relevant, issues like how to generate more good-paying jobs for the
<br>
underclass, an issue that is at the heart of the violence problem.
<br>
Gun control distracts the public and the legislature from the more
<br>
difficult tasks of taking beter care of the mentally ill, of
<br>
confronting the culture of poverty, and of imprisioning violent
<br>
criminals for lengthy terms.&quot;
<br>
<p>While I support private rather than government intervention, there
<br>
are still a large number of our own citizens who are in need, and
<br>
they are in need of good paying jobs.
<br>
<p>Crime is one result of the economic imbalance that still exists in
<br>
this country, although by no means it's only reason.
<br>
<p>I buy American in an attempt to help maintain an economic
<br>
livelihood for those probably least equipped to deal with
<br>
globalization, that and it's plain important to me that my
<br>
neighbors are doing well.
