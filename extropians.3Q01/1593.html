ss, care for children, buy cool toys, travel, buy nice clothes and impress potential sex partners does a lot to get people out of bed and doing jobs that otherwise they might not care to do.  And this goes beyond just surviving to having a good education

and career so real status can be attained and the perks which go with it.

<p>John, you live in Alaska, so you can be excused for the creeping sense
<br>
of entitlement you may  have here, since you already get some $2k each
<br>
year in oil profits for just being a citizen of Alaska, much as many of
<br>
the more stable socialist countries of europe likewise fund their
<br>
welfare states off of oil sales rather than actual economic
<br>
productivity.

<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; I think even in a society of guaranteed income, we would see most people working to better themselves.  STATUS and the desire to care for a family is so important to us primates.  And a guaranteed income would be SO nice for college students(right?).
</em><br>
<p>I suppose that is why so many Alaskans work to become better drinkers...
