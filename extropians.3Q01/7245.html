<em>&gt; &gt; Better idea than rappelling gear: an emergency belt that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; connected to a steel cable on a reel next to all windows.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The reel has a centrifugal clutch and damping so that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lowers the victim quickly up top and slows her descent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; near the ground.... If we were clever,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we could come up with a belt that would automatically release
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the escapee when she reached terra firma.

<p>True, if the system is the responsibility of the building owners.
<br>
The key is for each egress system to be privately owned. Of
<br>
course in that case is escapees might be more likely to
<br>
break the windows out, since a hammer is cheaper than anything
<br>
I can think of that would open a window inward.  Secondly, a
<br>
privately owned egress system would be more likely to be a
<br>
simple reel of cable with a centrifugal clutch, like the ones on
<br>
the old timey telephone dials that regulate the speed of descent.
<br>
Actually such a system could be made for a few hundred dollars,
<br>
but would be good for only one egress and to hell with the
<br>
people below.  A very sophisticated system good for several
<br>
escapes would likely cost many thousands, and more importantly
<br>
would require inspections and carry liability, and with that,
<br>
insurance etc, high cost.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How about a remote controlled model helicopter (or
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; version of your system is hoisted in place? Mark
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, ya got me thinking. Perhaps a deployable system with
<br>
reels on the roof.  When a window is opened inward it would
<br>
quickly lower a cable to that window.  The escapee would
<br>
be grabbed by a smart device and lowered.
<br>
<p>Perhaps a system like an external elevator that looks a bit like
<br>
those things the window washers stand upon, that lowers from
<br>
the roof and stops at floors where someone has opened inward
<br>
a window.  It would be smart enough to not stop at any floor
<br>
that is burning, and not stop at all once it gets below a burning
<br>
floor, so the support cables dont overheat in one spot.
<br>
<p>Or how about a big ropey lattice like those things the old-time
<br>
sailors used to climb up the side of a ship?  It would deploy
<br>
from the roof.  Instead of being static, it would be on wheels
<br>
in a big loop, like those cloth towel thingies in some fancy public
<br>
restrooms.  In an emergency, it could immediately deploy
<br>
and an arbitrary number of escapess could jump on whenever
<br>
they are ready.  Pure adrenaline would make them hold
<br>
on tighter than a cockleburr to a wool sock.  They would just
<br>
let go when they reached the ground.  Otherwise they would
<br>
be hauled right back up to the roof (ooh shiiiiiiit...)
<br>
<p>Another idea is three-minute oxygen cylinders for everyone
<br>
for running down smoky stairwells.  It might only be about
<br>
the size and weight of a common aerosol can.  A typical
<br>
yuppie could carry one in her briefcase.  Those could be privately
<br>
owned, which would get them in place in the short term.
<br>
I figure both WTC towers likely had at least a couple of stairwells
<br>
that were really smoky but not actually burning.  There should be
<br>
smart sensors that would tell people which stairwell is their best bet.
<br>
<p>Of all the ideas I have heard or thought of, I would rather take my
<br>
chances with a simple oxygen bottle and a pair of highly motivated
<br>
feet on a good old fashioned set of stairs.  But if I were a couch
<br>
potato that couldnt run down 100 flights, some of these other
<br>
schemes might work, or at least be far preferable to the old
<br>
geronimoooooo out the window.  spike
