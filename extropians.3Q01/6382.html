<p>
I've noticed a number of people jumping on the band wagon
<br>
against bin Laden, and thought I would make some points.
<br>
<p>First, it has been reported that the Afganistan government
<br>
has bin Laden and some associates under house arrest.  If
<br>
so and we and up asking them to be turned over to face
<br>
trial, we may end up getting them.
<br>
<p>Second, I believe I have read somewhere that one of the
<br>
primary reasons that bin Laden left Saudi Arabia was
<br>
that he was attempting to overthrow the government.
<br>
While we are all waving the flag and proclaiming freedom
<br>
and democracy we should remember that Saudi Arabia and several
<br>
other Arab nations is *not* democracies, they are still
<br>
&quot;kingdoms&quot;.  So, if anything, we should be aligned with
<br>
at least some of bin Laden's political perspective.
<br>
The obvious reason that we have not pushed the arabic
<br>
world harder into creating democracies is obviously
<br>
that we (the U.S.) don't want to rock the boat with
<br>
regard to our oil addiction.  So I think our position
<br>
may be at least a little hypocritical.
<br>
<p>The history of the last century seems to demonstrate pretty
<br>
well that turning Kingdoms or collections of &quot;kingdoms&quot;
<br>
(tribes led by chiefs) into democracies probably fails
<br>
more often than it succeeds.  Now why that is the case,
<br>
I am unsure.  Whether the U.S. (or even all democratic
<br>
nations collectively) have the wisdom on how to conduct
<br>
foreign policies that would maximize peaceful transitions
<br>
of non-democratic states into democratic states is unclear
<br>
to me.
<br>
<p>I think a lot more research needs to be done by many people
<br>
on the list with regard to both foreign polices by Western
<br>
democracies as well as the history and agenda bin Laden
<br>
has had before we can determine right and wrong here.
<br>
I seem to recall Americans certainly appreciated the
<br>
support of the French during the American Revolution.
<br>
And of course we *never* committed any acts of terrorism
<br>
except for that Tea Party incident.
<br>
<p>I find my self asking myself why isn't America supporting bin Laden
<br>
in his efforts to unseat the royal family of Saudi Arabia?
<br>
