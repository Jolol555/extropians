<em>&gt;&gt; Oh, Olga.  You miss my point entirely.  Here you are again

<em>&gt;&gt; beliefs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I personally am not interested in discussing this any more, with

</em><br>
<em>&gt; me about getting out and seeing the rest of the world (actually,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've already had that privilege).
</em><br>
<p>Do you think that this is what I have done, and am doing?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While I applaud that you have made journeys out of your comfort
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; socialist statist leftists that we are] have not examined issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of our &quot;comfort zone.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>First, can you find where you were described as a commie or a
<br>
pinko on our recent discussion?  Have you made a straw man here?
<br>
Second, I did not mean to imply that people from one side of
<br>
the political spectrum behave any different, statistically, than
<br>
those from any other part.  I said as much on several occasions.
<br>
I have simply noted that, far from only &quot;examining&quot; issues out
<br>
of my comfort zone, I pulled the &quot;other way&quot; in the ideological
<br>
tug-of-war that has been going on.  No one else has.  No one 
<br>
else probably will.  J. R. has come very close in his long
<br>
stream of consciousness post, and Joe may be headed in that
<br>
direction.  But that's it so far.  So no one from the side 
<br>
opposite to mine has even tried, so far as I can tell.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; C'mon, libertarians don't have a monopoly on &quot;sweet reason.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Wow.  You really read my appeal from a jaundiced viewpoint;
<br>
but then, so did most people, I think.  There was never even
<br>
the *slightest* implication that there was a monopoly on
<br>
letting reason into our lives:  it was clearly a description
<br>
of what may be possible for many people of every political
<br>
and philosophical position.  But I am not too hopeful that
<br>
you are going to believe me, or go back and re-examine my post.
