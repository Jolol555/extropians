This is wonderful advice Will, and I hope more people put it into practice.
<br>
<p>I've been using it mainly because it helps to broaden my own experience and 
<br>
helps reduce, in some small way, tension around me, but in the back of my 
<br>
mind have been some of the reasons that you mention.
<br>
<p>Another point you didn't mention is that it is very hard for people to 
<br>
wreak some kind of terror upon people who have become their friends.
<br>
<p>The point must also be made that these attempts at friendship must be 
<br>
genuine -- people can see through fakeness remarkably well, particularly if 
<br>
they are feeling paranoid to begin with.
<br>
<p>Very best wishes,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Miriam

<em>&gt;The situation is similar to driving a car of the same type

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here is a simple solution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Befriend the people you are suspicious of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Be nice to them.  Get to know them.  Invite them to dinner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you spend enough time befriending someone you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eventually figure out if the are friend, foe, or neutral.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sometimes you will find out that your suspicions were silly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Other times you will find your suspicions reasonable but wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Keep getting to know them until you feel comfortable or scared.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you find nothing to worry about you have made a friend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(or been bored for a few hours and made an acquaintance).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you find more and more things that worry you, talk to other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;friends and get other people to come and be friendly with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;person.  If you are feeling wary be a little careful but stay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;friendly and respectful.  If you are certain of guilt and feel at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;risk do what you need to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If someone does not want to be friendly with you that does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mean they are a terrorists, they may dislike you, they may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a hermit.  Get other people to try.  If they don't want to be friends
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with anyone you know and trust, then keep yours eyes on them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;until you figure out whether or not they are dangerous.  The whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time, be nice, friendly, respectful, etc.  It will not hurt you much to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be a little nice to a bad person (as long as you are careful).  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will do no real harm to the hermit or jerk.  You will be doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a good thing for nice people who just happen to superficially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resemble people you fear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is hard for terrorists to infiltrate a community.  It is easy for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorists to infiltrate a paranoid or insensitive society.
