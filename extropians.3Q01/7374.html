<p>Enforce the ban on guns except for those with proper ID and proof of 
<br>
qualification. A few dozen &quot;volunteer&quot; sky marshals that cost the airline 
<br>
and the government nothing on every flight would end the possibility of 
<br>
anyone repeating 9/11. The volunteers could be issued weapons deemed safe 
<br>
for the aircraft in exchange for their normal carry gun, which would be 
<br>
checked for the flight at the security station.
<br>
<p>'Nuff said.
