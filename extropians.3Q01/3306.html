<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;It is a never-ending source of amazement that bright people can make

the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;simplest and grossest mistakes--and that, no matter what you say or how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;clearly you say it, someone will misunderstand it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   I used to be a member of Mensa, an organisation where even the village
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; idiot has to have an IQ in the top 2% to join. People on welfare showed
</em><br>
up
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at meetings. People who were apparently mentally ill showed up. One even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; boasted about how crazy &quot;it&quot; was. In short lots of people showed up who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could not add two plus two and reliably get an answer of four. I am no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; longer a member of Mensa.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I went to several meeting but declined to joint for somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different reasons.  Here were all these big brains and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chose to spend their time on mostly silly games, meaningless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hobbies and looking for someone smart enough to date them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; despite their (often) utter lack of social skills or too-deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-centeredness.  There were some really great people there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't get me wrong.  But that didn't make the general atmosphere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   This experience forced me to make a clear distinction between IQ and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; common sense. If the entire population suddenly acquired ten extra IQ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; points, nothing much would change. If the entire population suddenly was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gifted with 10 extra common sense points, our society would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transformed overnight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everyone going to around 140+ in IQ overnight would also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transform the society pretty rapidly.  What is &quot;common sense&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is certainly, as many have observed, not &quot;common&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   Bums in the street would vanish, because begging is a harder way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; acquire funds, than working a job. Crime would plummet, because in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; long run crime usually really doesn't pay. Strife at the office, at
</em><br>
home,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and at school would be reduced because it is pointless. The economy
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; boom, everybody would be happy, there would be no more wars, etc, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This looks naive.  Who says there are sufficient jobs for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone to have one that pays a livable age even if everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does have &quot;common sense&quot;?  Who says that &quot;common sense&quot; would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abolish plain greed and the type of self-interest that runs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roughshod over others?  Who says it is enough to remove scarcity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking?  People will always be in strife as long as they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe there fundamentally is not and never will be enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go around.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Real happiness is even less common than common sense.  Removing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the roots of war requires more than instilling common sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if we had a good fix on what common sense is and the means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to instill it.
