<p>
&nbsp;I have just listened to Duncan Moon's September 18 piece on Islamic
<br>
reaction to the terrorist attacks on the United States.  I do not doubt the
<br>
sincerity of the moderate Islamic clerics who spoke in this piece, but I do
<br>
doubt that Mr. Moon knows anything about Islam and especially about the
<br>
central scripture of that religion, the Koran.
<br>
&nbsp;Like the rest of the U.S. press corps, Mr. Moon has passed on without
<br>
question the statements by moderate Muslims that &quot;Islam does not endorse
<br>
violence.&quot;  We will not as a nation come to understand how and why the
<br>
events of September 11 occurred until we take the time to study Islam and
<br>
develop an understanding of how a large number of people in the world use
<br>
religion to justify violence.  The simple and undisputable fact is that
<br>
there is clear and explicit language in the Koran that:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt; endorses the use of violence against &quot;unbelievers&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; requires that Islamic countries institute legal discrimination against
<br>
non-Muslims
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&gt; demands unequal treatment of women
<br>
<p>How do we, as a free people, come to terms with these facts?  How do
<br>
moderate Muslims rationalize their calls for peace and tolerance in light of
<br>
the clear and unambiguous text of their scripture to the contrary?  How can
<br>
democracy flourish in cultures where a religion based on that scripture is
<br>
enshrined in law?  These are the hard questions that our contemporary
<br>
cultural relativism apparently makes it impossible to ask.  By dodging these
<br>
questions, NPR does not encourage a pursuit of truth, but rather becomes
<br>
complicit in our civilization's unwillingness to come to terms with them.
