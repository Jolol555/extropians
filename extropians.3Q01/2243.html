<p>You do have problems with the ground geology, Spike. The primary problem
<br>
is that the ground is relatively porous and water seeps through rather
<br>
quickly down to the aquifer, where most of the fresh water in the
<br>
western US plains runs. Once that water hits the limestone, the trees
<br>
can't get at it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  In fact, it seems if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put our minds to it, we could figure out a way to store enough water
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inland to lower sea levels enough to simultaneously take the pressure
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to start with, and raise the global temperature at the same time, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salvage some of that good Siberian land the commies are wasting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently.
</em><br>
<p>I'm at this point relatively convinced that the Caspian basin functions
<br>
as a reservoir to take up losses in the Greenland Ice cap long enough to
<br>
allow the cycle to reverse itself without raising sea levels enough to
<br>
significantly undermine most of the Greenland cap OR the less stable of
<br>
the two Antarctic caps. Granted that we'd need to see some record of
<br>
this flooding, but I think it's interesting to note that the Black Sea
<br>
basin served a similar function when it was flooded at the end of the
<br>
last ice age, thus preventing further warming.
