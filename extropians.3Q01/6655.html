I actually think this is not a bad solution in many ways.
<br>
Anybody ever see Jonathon Livingston Seagull (the movie) back in the 80s?
<br>
The seagull in the film was a remote controlled glider.
<br>
<p>If the robot planes were built to look exceedingly like birds then they 
<br>
might not even cotton onto the fact that they are being observed. Of course 
<br>
if they did work it out it would mean every bird gets shot out of the 
<br>
skies. :-(
<br>
<p>Another possibility is to make the robot planes out of perspex so that they 
<br>
are effectively invisible from the ground. The circuitry can be made very 
<br>
small. The only real problem is engines and batteries. There are some 
<br>
light-weight fuel-cell solutions in production right now. And I seem to 
<br>
recall reading about some gel-based electrical &quot;muscles&quot; a little while back.
<br>
<p>CMOS technology has produced incredibly small, lightweight, cheap, 
<br>
electronic cameras. Plastic lenses are used in disposable cameras...
<br>
<p>Just some thoughts.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
