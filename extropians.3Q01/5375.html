</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;The World's Smallest Political Quiz&quot; at <a href="http://www.self-gov.org/quiz.html">http://www.self-gov.org/quiz.html</a>
<br>
seems pretty unbiased to me.  Of the ten questions, only two are even a
<br>
little bit begging for certain answers or make assertions.  Can you tell
<br>
me what questions you have a problem with?  What questions make you
<br>
uncomfortable.  I spoke at length about JUST THE FIRST SIX questions
<br>
of that awful English instrument you (or someone) submitted.
<br>
<p>Proof that objectivity is possible is easy:  just use questions
<br>
that are unbiased to the degree that one *cannot* tell the beliefs
<br>
of the question's framer.  I thought in your own stab at it, Charlie,
<br>
that you did quite a good job.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But what is infinitely more scary is a second possiblity:  that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; indeed the World's Shortest Political Quiz is mainly objective, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that this one on the contrary is to a great degree *more* loaded,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and that many people who agree with the objectives of this later
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; quiz don't mind it being so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Naah. This quiz doesn't actually imply that the people who set it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support these positions; it's designed to establish whether you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the person who's sitting the quiz, supports those positions.
</em><br>
<p>I thought it obvious the mind-set of whoever wrote that test.  He
<br>
or she is clearly left-liberal.
<br>
<p>Now it *IS* true that in *some* ideologies, vanilla discourse
<br>
is itself to be criticized.  Marxist rhetoric is unmistakeable,
<br>
and it's instantly obvious that someone *is not* a Marxist if
<br>
most sentences fail to have certain loaded words and phrases.
<br>
<p>But I have known many, many people who lie at obvious ends of the
<br>
political spectrum who are capable of using the same English language,
<br>
and fairly describing situations.  In fact, it's only when they slip
<br>
and give themselves away (often deliberately, of course) by the choice
<br>
of &quot;pinko&quot; for &quot;left&quot;, or &quot;homophobic&quot; for &quot;anti-gay&quot;, or &quot;nigger&quot; for
<br>
&quot;black&quot;, or &quot;exploitation&quot; for &quot;employment&quot; that they give away their
<br>
position.  Newscasters and quiz makers should hold themselves to a 
<br>
higher standard.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You seem to be confusing the political compass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quiz (which is aimed at people who come from a culture that is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own, where political discourse is framed in different terms --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for example the &quot;nigger&quot; word is merely considered rude, and what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you call a &quot;liberal&quot; would probably be at home in the conservative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; party) with an expression of the ideologies it's polling.
</em><br>
<p>Conceivably, you could be right.  That would be most amazing.  But
<br>
I'd be willing to bet that if I walked down the street in London
<br>
and took the first hundred people that I came to, they would be
<br>
able to guess the political ideology of that test's makers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In other words, what is really scary is when even slight injustices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aren't confessed as such when they are in the service of ideology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's another case of the good ends justifying the not-so-good means.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eh? I don't follow you. 
</em><br>
<p>I have reason to believe that the following does not fit *you* (especially
<br>
since looking at your own quiz).  Quite a number of people in the 20th
<br>
century, while they wouldn't come directly out and say so in so many words,
<br>
truly believe that lying or stealing for progressive causes is justified.
<br>
This is more true of the left than of the right because of the serious
<br>
setback that the extreme right suffered in the outcome of World War II.
<br>
If the Nazis and Japanese militarists won, and the democracies and
<br>
socialist country had lost, then it would be the right that was backed
<br>
up by powerful, extreme, ideologically uniform totalitarian countries.
<br>
<p>But what happened was that it was the left who inherited slogans like
<br>
&quot;political power comes out of the barrel of a gun&quot; from Lenin and Mao,
<br>
and a lot of other clearly sinister behavior/slogans from the
<br>
Chinese and Russian Communists.
<br>
<p>Another factor that breaks the left/right symmetry (at least in American
<br>
politics) is that conservatives are viewed as evil by the left, whereas
<br>
liberals are viewed as wrong or stupid by the right.  I've lost track of
<br>
the number of times that I *myself* have been accused on this very list
<br>
of &quot;having no compassion&quot;, or suffering from some other similar character
<br>
flaw.  Conservatives are viewed by American liberals (in many cases) as
<br>
*morally* deficient; corporation executives are honestly thought to be
<br>
monsters;  what tactics aren't justified when you're fighting evil?
