Hello everyone,
<br>
<p>This film may only be rivaled by _Matrix_ in creating discussion here!  And 
<br>
there are so many different things to talk about...
<br>
<p>I saw _A.I._ on its first day here in Anchorage with GREAT anticipation 
<br>
since it was the number one movie this summer I wanted to view. The advance 
<br>
reviews I had read of it in Newsweek and elsewhere said it was one of 
<br>
Spielberg's greatest films, if not his best ever.
<br>
<p>I was not disappointed. Spielberg was in very top form and I feel translated 
<br>
the notes of Kubrick into a truly great film. And as critics have pointed 
<br>
out, there are many layers and aspects to this movie which can make it 
<br>
appeal to a wide demographic.
<br>
<p>The mother/son/pinnochio aspect of the film grabbed my heartstrings and 
<br>
pulled hard.  I felt tears well up in my eyes on during several scenes. I 
<br>
think it would be hard for any person to not be touched by the depiction of 
<br>
humankind's inhumanity to his/her own creation.
<br>
<p>With this film the public will be getting positive memes about artificial 
<br>
intelligence and robotics which could really influence longterm public 
<br>
opinion about the machines which will actually exist in future decades. This 
<br>
film due to it's greatness will continue to be viewed for many years into 
<br>
the future.  I'm happy about that...
<br>
<p>******Spoiler******
<br>
<p>I would consider this film to be a &quot;science fiction fairy tale&quot; both because 
<br>
of the way it was based on the tale of Pinnochio, and because of how it 
<br>
ended on sort of a sad metaphysical note.
<br>
<p>My heart jumped as I saw the depiction of the posthumans and their 
<br>
astounding vehicles! I was so impressed by the thought which must have gone 
<br>
into their depiction in the film.  Did anyone else notice a sense of 
<br>
similarity in comparison to the aliens from Spielberg's &quot;Close Encounters&quot; 
<br>
film? lol I felt like I was actually looking at the future mind children of 
<br>
humanity.
<br>
<p>They were obviously the advanced sentient nanotech beings people like 
<br>
Drexler and Robert Frietas have envisioned. And yet they had the wisdom, 
<br>
kindness and love Ray Kurzweil speaks of.
<br>
<p>The scene where the posthuman talks with the android boy really affected me. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Audience members may have been somewhat creeped out by the posthuman 
<br>
physical appearance, but with the deep concern to the android boy which was 
<br>
shown in warm vocal tones, it would be hard to not be totally won over.  I 
<br>
think an important meme was sent out by that simple scene.
<br>
<p>I loved this film but had some problems with the ending.  I wish the far 
<br>
future &quot;machine people&quot; had told the boy that in fact humanity was not gone, 
<br>
but instead it had simply transformed into what they were!  I wish, I wish, 
<br>
I wish!
<br>
<p>Also, I found doubtful the whole idea that a scan of the space/time 
<br>
continuum could result in a flawed upload program which would result in only 
<br>
ONE day of life for the resurrectee!  I don't see any real science in it.  
<br>
But then, like I said before, this is more of a &quot;science fiction fairy tale&quot; 
<br>
and not straight science fiction.
<br>
<p>Of course, for emotional impact the idea worked very well.  I felt pained as 
<br>
the android boy had his one perfect day with his once again loving and 
<br>
devoted mother.  As they go to bed and he decides to never awaken himself I 
<br>
felt so sad.
<br>
<p>Often traditional fairy tales did have sad endings to teach a lesson of some 
<br>
sort.  And I think in our real world of pain, disappointment and death you 
<br>
can see why a positive and hopeful ending would feel untrue to the audience. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But then again, Hollywood is notorious for happy endings in films, even 
<br>
when the movie is ruined in a sense by it.
<br>
<p>I realize Spielberg was trying to be true to the vision of Stanley Kubrick 
<br>
who in turn based his notes on the short story by Brian Aldiss.  I have not 
<br>
yet read the Aldiss story but would assume it ended on a sad note as the 
<br>
film itself did.
<br>
<p>I would have ended the film differently(thinking as an extropian!). Starting 
<br>
off, the posthuman would have explained he was the direct descendant of 
<br>
humanity and possibly even an upload.
<br>
<p>There would have been no &quot;technical problem&quot; with scanning the universe to 
<br>
recover/simulate his mother's mind.  Or else she would have been a total 
<br>
simulation based on his memories of her.
<br>
<p>They would have lived in a replica of their old home, but in time they would 
<br>
have grown curious about what laid beyond it.  The final scene of the movie 
<br>
would have them venturing forth into the posthuman world with the 
<br>
spokesperson posthuman as their guide and friend.  In my opinion that would 
<br>
have been the way to end it.  :)
<br>
<p>Still, I dearly loved this film and feel many great memes are being spread 
<br>
throughout the world with it.  I think Brian Aldiss, Stanley Kubrick, and 
<br>
Steven Spielberg(along with all the actors and crew) have created something 
<br>
which will definitely increase the chances of our successful transition to 
<br>
the singularity.  I am very grateful.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
