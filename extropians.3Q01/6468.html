<p>When reading the Q'ran, one has to place it in the right cultural
<br>
context as it was written (just like for the Bible and other
<br>
scriptures), and in the context of how it is interpeted tody. These
<br>
are fairly different things, although the gap might be lesser than
<br>
between the contents and interpretations of the Bible. Much of it only
<br>
makes sense in terms of local politics near the life of the prophet,
<br>
which means that the layers of interpretations that have been added
<br>
gain extra weight. 
<br>
<p>There are plenty of quite secular muslims today, and while their
<br>
beliefs are based on the Q'ran and the islamic culture that emerged
<br>
around it, they are just as free-thinking as the secular christians of
<br>
the US. 
<br>
<p>That said, I think there is a conservative aspect of Islam due to 1)
<br>
the stated determinism, 2) the idea of an already completed revelation
<br>
and 3) the common cultural idea that consensus is important. This
<br>
doesn't mean it is against (say) new technology per se, but such
<br>
things always has to be judged against the pre-existing standards in a
<br>
way which the western post-renaissance progress and individualism
<br>
oriented cultural atmosphere did away with. Note that this
<br>
conservatism can be more or less strong, and is also quite different
<br>
from the hate fuelling terrorism. But conservatism helps sustain
<br>
closed societies, and this is the breeding ground for prejudice and
<br>
hate. So maybe the real target of change should be irrational
<br>
conservatism (of whatever creed).
