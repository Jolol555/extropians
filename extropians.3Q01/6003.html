Octopus arms strike out alone
<br>

TOM CLARKE
<br>
<p>You'd have thought that of all creatures, the octopus would keep track of what
<br>
its arms are up to. But an octopus' arms, it turns out, often function
<br>
completely independently of its brain.
<br>
<p>The finding solves the biological conundrum of how the octopus coordinates and
<br>
controls its eight super-supple arms. Understanding this could help engineers
<br>
design better robots.
<br>
<p>By electrically stimulating nerves in amputated octopus arms, or just by
<br>
tickling the skin near them, Binyamin Hochner, of the Hebrew University of
<br>
Jerusalem, and colleagues made the limbs reach outwards just as an intact
<br>
octopus reaches for a piece of food.
<br>
<p>&quot;We saw autonomous control of the entire arm,&quot; says Hochner. This and other
<br>
simple experiments demonstrate that the nervous control program for reaching
<br>
is written into the arm's nerves, the team believe.
<br>
<p>Joints constrain other animals' limbs, making the mental processing of
<br>
coordinated movement easier to understand.
<br>
<p>But octopus arms can adopt a virtually infinite number of positions. Each
<br>
tentacle contains 50 million nerves, of which around 40,000 are connected to
<br>
muscles. As only a few nerves run from each tentacle to the animal's brain,
<br>
however, biologists have puzzled over how the movement of one such arm - let
<br>
alone eight - is coordinated.
<br>
<p>Hochner's group suggests that by abdicating control of often-repeated tasks
<br>
such as reaching, the octopus brain is free to concentrate on other things.
<br>
&quot;This control strategy overcomes the complexity of [the arm's] structure,&quot;
<br>
says Hochner.
<br>
<p>This idea is borne out by octopus behaviour: the animals execute most tasks
<br>
using just a small repertoire of arm movements. The team now plans to try to
<br>
stimulate and then model these stereotypical moves.
<br>
<p>Bring on the Octobots?
<br>
Robotics experts long to understand octopus arm control. It may provide clues
<br>
for building automatons that, unlimited by joints, can move in every dimension
<br>
simultaneously.
<br>
<p>Until now, the animals' sophistication had been baffling. &quot;They were just too
<br>
complex to go after,&quot; says Bob Full, who builds biologically inspired robots
<br>
at the University of California, Berkeley. Researchers couldn't understand how
<br>
to program a computer to control limbs with unlimited freedom of movement.
<br>
<p>Now they might not have to. &quot;A robot could have no brain at all, yet still be
<br>
highly manoeuvrable,&quot; says Full. Hochner's work could be &quot;the first step
<br>
towards building the next great manipulator,&quot; Full hopes.
