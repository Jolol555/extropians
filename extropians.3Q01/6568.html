Following is an Afghani-American writer, on Afghanistan and what an 
<br>
invasion might mean.
<br>
<p>Obligatory Extro relevance: sounds like clear thinking, mostly.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>I've been hearing a lot of talk about &quot;bombing Afghanistan back to 
<br>
the Stone Age.&quot; Ronn Owens, on KGO Talk Radio today, allowed that 
<br>
this would mean killing innocent people, people who had nothing to do 
<br>
with this atrocity, but &quot;we're at war, we have to accept collateral 
<br>
damage. What else can we do?&quot; Minutes later I heard some TV pundit 
<br>
discussing whether we &quot;have the belly to do what must be done.&quot;
<br>
<p>And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I 
<br>
am from Afghanistan, and even though I've lived here for 35 years 
<br>
I've never lost track of what's going on there. So I want to tell 
<br>
anyone who will listen how it all looks from where I'm standing.
<br>
<p>I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. There is no 
<br>
doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity 
<br>
in New York. I agree that something must be done about those monsters.
<br>
<p>But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan. They're not even 
<br>
the government of Afghanistan. The Taliban are a cult of ignorant 
<br>
psychotics who took over Afghanistan in 1997. Bin Laden is a 
<br>
political criminal with a plan. When you think Taliban, think Nazis. 
<br>
When you think Bin Laden, think Hitler. And when you think &quot;the 
<br>
people of Afghanistan&quot; think &quot;the Jews in the concentration camps.&quot; 
<br>
It's not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this 
<br>
atrocity. They were the first victims of the perpetrators. They would 
<br>
exult if someone would come in there, take out the Taliban and clear 
<br>
out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country.
<br>
<p>Some say, why don't the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban? 
<br>
The answer is, they're starved, exhausted, hurt, incapacitated, 
<br>
suffering. A few years ago, the United Nations estimated that there 
<br>
are 500,000 disabled orphans in Afghanistan--a country with no 
<br>
economy, no food. There are millions of widows. And the Taliban has 
<br>
been burying these widows alive in mass graves. The soil is littered 
<br>
with land mines, the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets. These 
<br>
are a few of the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown 
<br>
the Taliban.
<br>
<p>We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone 
<br>
Age. Trouble is, that's been done. The Soviets took care of it 
<br>
already. Make the Afghans suffer? They're already suffering. Level 
<br>
their houses? Done. Turn their schools into piles of rubble? Done. 
<br>
Eradicate their hospitals? Done. Destroy their infrastructure? Cut 
<br>
them off from medicine and health care? Too late. Someone already did 
<br>
all that.
<br>
<p>New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs. Would they at 
<br>
least get the Taliban? Not likely. In today's Afghanistan, only the 
<br>
Taliban eat, only they have the means to move around. They'd slip 
<br>
away and hide. Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled 
<br>
orphans, they don't move too fast, they don't even have wheelchairs. 
<br>
But flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldn't really be a strike 
<br>
against the criminals who did this horrific thing. Actually it would 
<br>
only be making common cause with the Taliban--by raping once again 
<br>
the people they've been raping all this time
<br>
<p>So what else is there? What can be done, then? Let me now speak with 
<br>
true fear and trembling. The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in 
<br>
there with ground troops. When people speak of &quot;having the belly to 
<br>
do what needs to be done&quot; they're thinking in terms of having the 
<br>
belly to kill as many as needed. Having the belly to overcome any 
<br>
moral qualms about killing innocent people. Let's pull our heads out 
<br>
of the sand. What's actually on the table is Americans dying. And not 
<br>
just because some Americans would die fighting their way through 
<br>
Afghanistan to Bin Laden's hideout. It's much bigger than that folks. 
<br>
Because to get any troops to Afghanistan, we'd have to go through 
<br>
Pakistan. Would they let us? Not likely. The conquest of Pakistan 
<br>
would have to be first. Will other Muslim nations just stand by? You 
<br>
see where I'm going. We're flirting with a world war between Islam 
<br>
and the West.
<br>
<p>And guess what: that's Bin Laden's program. That's exactly what he 
<br>
wants. That's why he did this. Read his speeches and statements. It's 
<br>
all right there. He really believes Islam would beat the west. It 
<br>
might seem ridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize the world 
<br>
into Islam and the West, he's got a billion soldiers. If the west 
<br>
wreaks a holocaust in those lands, that's a billion people with 
<br>
nothing left to lose, that's even better from Bin Laden's point of 
<br>
view. He's probably wrong, in the end the west would win, whatever 
<br>
that would mean, but the war would last for years and millions would 
<br>
die, not just theirs but ours. Who has the belly for that? Bin Laden 
<br>
does. Anyone else?
