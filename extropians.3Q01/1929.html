<p>This article has the same stuff you always hear: eat right (vegetarian), 
<br>
don't smoke and exercise.  Also suggests that some sort of spiritual support 
<br>
system is beneficial as well.
<br>
<p>As a former pentecostal Christian I can 'testify' to the beneficial euphoric 
<br>
feeling of listening to a great choir, surrounded by a supportive family of 
<br>
fellow believers all of whom professed a love for my God and me and the 
<br>
feeling that no matter how bad I was yesterday, God still loved me and would 
<br>
forgive me if I 'repented.'  A clean slate is a very handy thing to have.  
<br>
It was also incredibly satisfying to believe that, in worshipping God, I was 
<br>
doing the most important work in the world.
<br>
<p>But, now that I'm an atheist, much of that sort of positive energy is gone 
<br>
from my life.  I can't believe the fairy tales anymore.  But I would like to 
<br>
have some sort of spirituality in my life that didn't depend upon believing 
<br>
a lie.  Since giving up on theism, I've tended toward Zen buddhist thought 
<br>
and practice and a sort of reverence for truth and quality ala _Zen and The 
<br>
Art of Motorcyle Maintenance_.  This has been fairly satisfying of my 
<br>
spiritual yen, but not to the same extent as being in the house of worship 
<br>
used to provide.
<br>
<p>Any others on this list have a spiritual yearning?  I'd be interested to 
<br>
hear your thoughts, comments on how you satisfy it sans theism.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>Life is good.  Refuse to die.
