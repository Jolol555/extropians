<p>I can see a *very* positive effect of not hitting back.

If the US follow the trail to the culprits and bring them to justice 
<br>
legally USA would be seen as impeccably just and even-handed. They would 
<br>
remain the victim in the tragedy. Sympathy would be with USA and the poor 
<br>
civilians who suffered (and continue to suffer) from this terrible act.
<br>
<p>If, however, USA goes off half-cocked firing blindly at all comers then the 
<br>
pain of the people in the WTC will be overshadowed and, worldwide, less 
<br>
people will feel sympathy. Worse, those who get struck but were innocent 
<br>
will be the next round of terrorists to kill more US citizens.
<br>
<p>To avoid over-reaction would be to help defuse the whole thing, make 
<br>
everybody feel safer, and turn world opinion massively against the 
<br>
terrorists. The bad guys would lose in a big way. But it would have to be 
<br>
followed up with softening foreign policy. USA has done some despicable 
<br>
things around the world. Australia is no angel here either (Bougainville 
<br>
makes me moan).

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
