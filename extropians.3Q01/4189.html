<p>Olga, we elect you as the disinterested organization.  Check out a
<br>
copy at the local library and check it out.  I do not endorse all the
<br>
conclusions of the Bell Curve, but I read it and learned a lot of
<br>
good questions, which led me to read Gould's Mismeasure of Man,
<br>
etc.  I recommend the introduction to TBC as a thought provoking
<br>
passage.  I have watched the racism thread on extropians with
<br>
interest to see if racism *can be* discussed rationally, or if as
<br>
some have suggested, the whole issue is best left alone.
<br>
<p>If one were to try to invent a *single number* that measures physical
<br>
strength, what would that be?  How would it be measured?  By some
<br>
index of physical tests of some kind?  An average of ratings between
<br>
1 and 10?  Bench press?  Number of pull-ups you can do?
<br>
<p>Think it over: it may be impossible for one number to describe a
<br>
person's strength.  Many of the Bell Curve's detractors argue that
<br>
one number cannot describe a person's intellect, and they may
<br>
well be right. However, we still know the difference between a
<br>
weak person and a strong person.  And we know the difference
<br>
between a smart person and a dumb one.  IQ does measure
<br>
*something*.  SAT scores do indicate something.
<br>
<p>If someone can suggest a way to come up with a physical analogy
<br>
to IQ, I will suggest some games we can play with it that were
<br>
inspired by the Bell Curve and its many detractors.  spike
