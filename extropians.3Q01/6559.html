<p><em>&gt; &gt;H/W/G: some of the most effective martial artists I know are short,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;light females.  The difference?  Combat training - which is what I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;suggesting be supplied.  (And attitude, granted, but the training can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;teach them to control attitude as necessary.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And you think that terrorists are not trained in martial arts in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their camps?  Muslims have embraced the martial arts no less than we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have, and soliers are taught them the world over.
</em><br>
<p>Professional soldiers, yes.  But the more skills you pump into someone,
<br>
the more they are worth - to themselves and others - and the more they
<br>
have to lose by dying.  Therefore, their abilities will likely not be
<br>
as highly developed as a professional guard who not only wishes to
<br>
live and save the lives of the many innocents nearby, but knows there
<br>
will likely be some earthly reward (maybe a raise, maybe a promotion,
<br>
maybe just job security) for victory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;BTW, the reason I suggest this instead of a specific Sky Marshal: the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;stewards will normally be out and about, justifying their employment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and not dozing off, if terrorists attack.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (S)he just has to sit in the front row next to the cockpit access and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be firable if observed snoozing, with a mirror cemented in the front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bulkhead for rear visual access.
</em><br>
<p>Take it from an unfortunately experienced one: there are plenty of ways
<br>
to slack off without being detected but which do reduce one's awareness
<br>
of what is going on, if one's official orders boil down to &quot;sit there
<br>
and do nothing productive&quot; most of the time (and are meant as such,
<br>
instead of &quot;well, that's what we have to *officially* say, but...&quot;).
<br>
Sky Marshals would be vulnerable to temptation to such activities,
<br>
especially addictive ones, which would degrade their effectiveness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Plus, arming the stewards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;gaurantees you'll have more than one security officer; single-purpose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Sky Marshals would likely be reduced to just 1 for budget reasons (not to mention, wasting space on the 99+% of flights where they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;needed).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Considering the additionla training and requirements this would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impose upon them, and the concommitant funds required to compensate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them fairly, a couple of sky marshalls per plane would not be much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more expensive, and perhaps cheaper.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, and there's the concern.  Whatever system is put into place *will*
<br>
be optimized for cost-effectiveness.  If an entire person is completely
<br>
unuseful in the vast majority of flights, efforts will be made to
<br>
remove that person, or at least minimize the person's impact on the
<br>
profitability of the rest of the flight, without much regard for
<br>
effectiveness in the few cases where that person is needed.  If, on
<br>
the other hand, security is an extra function of people who are useful
<br>
for other things, and can be added on such that even when this
<br>
particular function is cost-minimized (another reason for concealed
<br>
weapons: stewards which don't look like security officers can still be
<br>
customer-friendly, thus minimizing impact on the profit-enhancing
<br>
service aspect) it retains its effectiveness...
