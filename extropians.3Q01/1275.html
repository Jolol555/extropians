<br>
has some interesting comments on the topic:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, during the Big Bang, the Universe underwent severe density
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fluctuations, which might have been capable of creating &quot;mini&quot; black
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holes with masses many orders of magnitude less than the black holes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that are created today. Those with masses much less than 10^12 kg
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would have exploded by now, and those on the order of 10^12 kg would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have lifetimes comparable with the current age of the Universe (~15
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;billion years).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can get a feel for what such a primordial black hole would &quot;look&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like by examining a black hole with an initial mass of ~ 10^12
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kg. The only assumptions needed are that (1) the Universe is ~15
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;billion years old, (2) the black hole is non-rotating and uncharged,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and (3) the black hole has incurred no increase in mass. The Cosmic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microwave Background Radiation in which the black hole has been bathed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the extent of its lifetime can also be neglected. The evaporation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time for such a black hole is around 20 billion years. This would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give it a current mass of ~5 * 10^11 kg (about half of its initial
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mass). Using eq. (9), we obtain a surface temperature of about 2 *
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10^11 K! This black hole is anything but black, as by eq. (12), it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is emitting ~1500 megawatts of power. Considering the incredible
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surface temperature, this may even seem a little small. However,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Schwarzschild radius for such a black hole is less than a fermi...
<br>
<p>Jupiter's mass is about 2 * 10^27 kg, far above this value, hence a black
<br>
hole of the size Mike is asking about (0.1 to 1.0 Jupiters) would have
<br>
a lifetime essentially infinite compared to the age of the universe.
<br>
The energy output is inversely proportional to the mass squared,
<br>
so a Jupiter sized black hole would be outputting 10^31 times less,
<br>
which would be an unmeasurably tiny amount of power, at a temperature of
<br>
almost absolute  zero.  Hawking radiation is insignificant for planetary
<br>
sized objects.
<br>
<p>The 10^12 kg threshold for Hawking radiation/evaporation to be significant
<br>
would correspond to roughly a kilometer-sized chunk of rock, something
<br>
for which a gravitational signature would normally be undetectable.
<br>
So if you can see effects of its gravity, it could always be a black
<br>
hole in a shell, and Hawking evaporation will not be an issue.
