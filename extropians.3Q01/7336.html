<p>Well, so you say. Thanks. I must take you literally here--you mean to
<br>
say that you read the piece and decided the final phrase abnegated the other
<br>
content. Too bad; I thought you might have more of a sense of proportion.
<br>
It's me, Michael Butler, here, 'gene. Don't we know each other, a little,
<br>
after all this time on the list?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To cite a recent case, a superficially reasonable email on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-WTC policy sailed into my inbox a few days ago. It made sense right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unto the final sentence, which read &quot;God bless America&quot;. Now, I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trust people basically driven by inscrutable motivations. One might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support points of policy, warily so, but certainly not the person pushing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. Sooner or later, the dissonance must surface.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He might be playing for his audience, but can you afford the benefit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubt in such cases?
</em><br>
<p>I can at least remember to ask the question every time I *don't*
<br>
get a boatload of other troublesome signals. YMMV.
<br>
<p>I do not consider the expression &quot;God bless America&quot; inscrutable.
<br>
People who use it _are_ deserving of close inspection. Some are OK.
<br>
It is a trope. There is a limit on everyone's attention. Choose wisely.
<br>
<p>The trick is to make no unnecessary enemies. If it is a foregone 
<br>
conclusion that anyone who believes in a supreme being is an enemy,
<br>
you have made 80% of the world your enemy. I repeat, choose wisely.
<br>
<p>The key, it seems to me, is to come to know one's speakers.
<br>
That takes the establishment of a relationship, over time.
<br>
<p>MMB
<br>
<p>PS: Further ex.: One can twist my current .sig into an excuse for atrocity.
<br>
Tough. If I catch you doing that, I will punish you--whoever you are.
