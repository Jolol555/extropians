<p><em>&gt; That's very creative, except that it involves taking revenge on Islam

</em><br>

<em>&gt; I do wonder why the U.S. doesn't print up handbooks of democratic theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and citizen responsibility and &quot;The Incredible Bread Machine&quot; and drop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them on nondemocratic nations.  This seems like such a blatantly obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing to do.  Likewise, I'm still sore that the US failed to print up a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billion copies of &quot;How To Be a Citizen in a Capitalist Society&quot; and send
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them over to the remnants of the Soviet Union after the collapse.
</em><br>

Although I think Spike's original idea would be highly counter productive
<br>
the kind of proposals made here are surely what needs to be looked at as a
<br>
long-term cultural/intellectual strategy. The problem is not simply
<br>
geopolitics but the existence of a particular kind of religious mindset
<br>
which has appeared in Islam. What I would look to do is to revive the
<br>
rationalist tradition in Islam, which suffered such a huge defeat in the
<br>
13th century. Time to print and distribute lots of copies of Averroes to
<br>
young Muslim intellectuals (BTW most Muslim terrorists are highly educated)
<br>
and to revive the rationalist Mutazilite tradition. This would have the
<br>
advantage of coming from_within_the Islamic tradition. Steve Davies
