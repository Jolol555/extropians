</em><br>
<p>I was suggesting playing around with them. What I was suggesting
<br>
is keeping a bit of a safety net through up to the second (or as
<br>
cloase or better as possible) backups.  The decision of whether
<br>
or not to be brought back and in what matter still should be up
<br>
to the sentient. Giving good enough tech it would be possible in
<br>
theory to ask them in the &quot;in between lives or potential lives&quot;
<br>
state by running the backup virtually and seeing what they wish
<br>
next.  Question though: Is the wish to terminate oneself made
<br>
with an ailing mind actually always to be honored or is it best
<br>
to heal the mind first?  This gets into all matter of sticky
<br>
issues.
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I was a posthuman superintelligence, I would do what I could to
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational behavior. But I don't think I would be morally entitled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to use force or directly hack them even if I was Omega itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I think it is fine to give them a choice of trying again or not.
