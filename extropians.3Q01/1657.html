</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not actually too worried about paying my taxes for &quot;the incompetent

<em>&gt; &quot;commie&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Don't worry about it. True communism is indistinguishable from a
<br>
completely free market.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd support a guaranteed minimum wage if we could get the economics of it to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; a world of abundance produced by nanotech, it might not be such a big &quot;if&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all.
</em><br>
<p>No, it wouldn't be an 'if' at all. Dead certainty. However, don't think
<br>
we will all be living lives of ease as intellectuals. There will be a
<br>
period where the less intelligent will only find useful employment as
<br>
servants performing the less easy to automate jobs, but these positions
<br>
will pay quite well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I made a comment earlier that I could not see a principled way to stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments from spending money on schools etc. J.R. shot back a remark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about toll roads and private schools, but my thoughts were not about whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are practical private alternatives to public infrastructure. It was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the central question of political philosophy: the limits of political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obligation. I actually think that it's damn hard justifying the state *at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all*.
</em><br>
<p>Damn hard if you hold to principles that dislike monopolies in any form.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, minarchists want to justify the state but only in so far as it provides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protection of life and property, enforces contracts, and keeps out the bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guys in the geographic region next door (or across the other side of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world these days). A minarchist state would have a military, police, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimalist legal system and a system of courts, but not much more. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, Nozick's opening chapters of _Anarchy, State and Utopia_ try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steer a middle course between philosophical anarchism and Leviathan, and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justify something like this. I am pretty convinced that they fail. See
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert Paul Wolff's classic article &quot;Robert Nozick's Derivation of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Minimal State&quot; and see what you think.
</em><br>
<p>The US government started out like this, but the primary problem was
<br>
that the states themselves were essentially given cart blanche in the
<br>
10th amendment to do anything they could con their populaces to approve.
<br>
The 14th balanced this out a bit, but not before significant damage was
<br>
done and the feds had grown to a point of sustained over unity reaction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I add that the problem of political obligation is at least semi-independent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the economic virtues of either pure capitalism or the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mercantilist system (corporations in cahoots with governments). I can live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the mercantilist system quite happily but don't see how it can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *justified* &lt;g&gt;. Indeed, some kinds of libertarianism would lead to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion that an unregulated capitalist system is the answer, but that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporate form is not legitimate.
</em><br>
<p>This is essentially my point of view. All of the ills ascribed to the
<br>
free market are essentially a function of mercantilist collution with
<br>
government thuggery.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, when it gets down to the attitude we should take to the &quot;incompetent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor&quot;, my heart is with Damien, wherever my jurisprudential theorising may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be. I'm not too worried about taking away incentives and so on where I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people in real trouble. I might run a pretty tough welfare state if I were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in charge but I certainly wouldn't abolish the welfare state.
</em><br>
<p>The primary problem with the concept of the 'incompetent poor' is that
<br>
most of their incompetence is not genetic, it is learned. If their
<br>
primary instruments of learning are controlled by the powerful (i.e.
<br>
television, textbooks by publishing companies, etc) then they are
<br>
justified in claiming to be oppressed, they are just too ignorant to
<br>
properly prescribe proper solutions. Getting a free income may sound
<br>
fine, but its a really stupid solution. Getting minimum wages and hiring
<br>
quotas may sound fine, but they are stupid ideas. Getting guaranteed
<br>
benefits may sound fine, but it is not tenable if they are not
<br>
sufficiently productive. The solution is obviously linked to the
<br>
problem: learning.
