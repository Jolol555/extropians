</em><br>
<p>About 90% of available steganography packages can be broken, in the sense
<br>
1) you realize there is a hidden message in there 2) you can extract the
<br>
cypher, not plain (you weren't that foolish to use plain in stegano, were
<br>
you?).  You're still left with the rather hard task of breaking the
<br>
cryptosystem, or extract the passphrase by perp surveillance or rubberhose
<br>
cryptoanalysis (it's not elegant, but, hey, it works).
<br>
<p>However, there are remaining 10% of steganography packages which will be
<br>
hard to crack. In case you're interested, I can give you a list of the
<br>
good ones.
<br>
<p>The main value of steganography is that it makes screening for it very,
<br>
very expensive. The intelligence communicty itself doesn't have the
<br>
resources, and the ISPs would go broke trying to comply with snooping
<br>
requirements.
<br>
<p>Though CPU is pretty cheap right now, realtime sophisticated statistical
<br>
and spectral traffic analysis will remain expensive, because the traffic
<br>
is adaptive. Multimedia and VR streams will become very common in the next
<br>
decade.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On most forms of encryption the simplest way to circumvent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly if you are a spook, is to plant software on the user
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system that finds any keys and so on and send them along to you.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely. Planting a hardware box in your keyboard or keyboard cable
<br>
will record every single key you entered. Ditto applies for software
<br>
keystroke loggers. Passphrases can be frequently recovered by analysing
<br>
swap space.
<br>
<p>However, to install these you have to enter the premises, which can be
<br>
detected with tripwire, both low and high tech.  Remote expoits are
<br>
useless, if crypto is conducted in hardened compartments, such as
<br>
dedicated crypto boxes, or an air gap protected machine, exchanging
<br>
*nonexecutable* files via MOD sneakernet. Such a machine can be made to be
<br>
very hard to analyze using TEMPEST.
<br>
<p>A wearable is very interesting for doing crypto, because it is always
<br>
under your control, and it's low power, particularly the hud. Easy to
<br>
shield, if you know what you're doing. Of course, if you're on wireless
<br>
network, you're still required to do the deep secret stuff in a dedicated
<br>
tamper-proof hardware box.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All of that said, only a fool would not at least try for better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security.
</em><br>
<p>Absolute security is infinitely expensive. However, with a very modest
<br>
effort you can make it very, very hard for Mallory. Phasing out clear
<br>
streams in favour of cypher will make some people, very, very upset. Man
<br>
in the middle is still largely academic these days, and can easily be
<br>
prevented by reading the key fingerprints over audio.
