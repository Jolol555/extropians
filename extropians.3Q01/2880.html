Storm experts make cloud vanish

Storm experts in the US have made a cloud vanish from the sky for the first 
<br>
time. 
<br>
<p>They achieved the feat by sprinkling a water-absorbing powder over the cloud, 
<br>
making it disappear from sight and weather station radar screens. They hope 
<br>
the powder will one day dry up deadly hurricanes and tropical storms.

<br>
&quot;It is the moisture that gives hurricanes their strength,&quot; says Peter Cordani 
<br>
who runs Dyn-O-Mat, the company that makes the product. &quot;In the case of a 
<br>
huge hurricane, we would not be trying to soak it up altogether. But what we 
<br>
would do is break it up and reduce its strength and killing potential. We 
<br>
think we can save lives with this product and we are very happy about that.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The powder could also banish rain over open-air events and sports fixtures. 
<br>
Cordani and his team hope to get government permission to tackle a hurricane 
<br>
or tropical storm in the coming season.
<br>
<p><p>Disappearing trick 
<br>
<p><p>In their latest experiment, large military aircraft scattered the powder 
<br>
through a storm cloud 1600 metres long and over 4000 metres deep. It took 
<br>
about 4000 kilograms of powder to soak up the moisture from the cloud, making 
<br>
it virtually disappear. &quot;I had calls from a weather tower and even from 
<br>
Channel 5 news in Miami, saying that they had seen the cloud literally 
<br>
disappear off the radar screen. They confirmed that there had been a tall 
<br>
build-up and the next moment it was gone,&quot; Cordani says.
<br>
<p>Each grain of the powder, called Dyn-O-Gel, is capable of absorbing 2000 
<br>
times its weight in moisture, condensation and rain. Each molecule of powder 
<br>
can hold several molecules of water. The wet powder becomes a gel.
<br>
<p>The shape of the grains is also crucial for maximum absorption of moisture. 
<br>
&quot;If you were to look at a grain under a microscope, it would look rather like 
<br>
a cornflake,&quot; says Cordani. &quot;This means that they flutter back and forth like 
<br>
a snowflake as they pass through the cloud, taking up as much moisture as 
<br>
possible. The first polymer we made just went straight down through the 
<br>
cloud,&quot; he says. 
<br>
<p><p>Soft landing 
<br>
<p><p>Once the polymer turns into a gel, it becomes heavier and falls to earth. The 
<br>
gel dissolves when it hits salt water, so if possible, storm clouds will be 
<br>
tackled over the ocean. 
<br>
<p>But the gel should still be safe if it falls over land. &quot;Much of the gel 
<br>
evaporates on the way down, and it is biodegradable and not hazardous to the 
<br>
environment or anybody's health,&quot; says Cordani. The company spent $1 million 
<br>
on the test, and hopes to sell their powder to the US government.
<br>
<p>The same powder can also be used to help make rain. The tiny flakes help bind 
<br>
rain drops together, stopping them from evaporating as quickly. Once the 
<br>
powder is turned into a water-laden gel you could also use it to fight fires 
<br>
by dousing the flames.
<br>
<p>So, can we have sunny days whenever we like? Maybe. &quot;If there was a 50-mile 
<br>
storm front moving in, we could only put holes in it. It would just keep 
<br>
coming,&quot; says Cordani. But &quot;if there was a cloud threatening a sports 
<br>
fixture, it would be possible to get rid of it&quot;.
