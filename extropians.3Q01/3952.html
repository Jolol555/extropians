</em><br>
<p><p>Good grief.  Heinlein wrote straight from the heart as well as
<br>
the head and I doubt very much he had any intention whatsoever
<br>
of appealling to supposed reds in the literary world. 
<br>
Especially as he wrote in an era when the literati had very
<br>
little if any use for science fiction.  They were not his
<br>
audience.
<br>
<p>Heinlein is also infamous as the original libertarian sci-fi
<br>
author.  No other sf author of the time wrote so elogquently for
<br>
the importance of and rights of the individual beyond any State.
<br>
To accuse RAH of cozying up to the Russians to be more
<br>
acceptable to a literati that had no use for such &quot;pulp trash&quot;
<br>
is ridiculous and an insult.
<br>
<p>Russian slang could be part of his books simply because the
<br>
Russkis were there first and because they launched 10-100 times
<br>
as much stuff into space as we did over many years.  Also, the
<br>
Russians after WWII acquired as much (or more) of the rocket
<br>
scientist talent than the US did and pushed harder and earlier
<br>
for space exploration and conquest.  It would be very wierd if
<br>
there weren't Russian slang (at least) present in tales of near
<br>
earth space.  Its absence would betray even more bias.
