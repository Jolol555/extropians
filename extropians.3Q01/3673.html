<p>
Michael Wiik has a theory that appears to fit the facts as I know
<br>
them:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I have been told (but have not independently confirmed), that at one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; point, one high-profile African-American said that there was no more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; terrible feeling for him than to be walking down the street at night, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; hearing footsteps, and being _relieved_ when he saw that the other person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; was white.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such things have routinely been commented on by black columnists in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Washington Post. Here's my theory:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For this purpose we can divide blacks into two groups, 'raceless' and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'fictive kinship'. These are terms from a Washington Post magazine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article. To put it way too simply (for contrast), 'raceless' blacks want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fit in to american culture, study hard, and generally do well as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result of this, especially among young people. (I note many many more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mixed groups of kids today than when (for example) I was in high school,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and regard this as a very good thing). By contrast, 'fictive kinship'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blacks see most if not all whites as the enemy, promote black culture,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and regard 'raceless' blacks as Uncle Toms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I can suppose that 'fictive kinship' blacks see themselves as living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in an occupied state. In this scenario, 'raceless' blacks are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collaborators with the oppressive government, and can be thusly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered legitimate targets. I would suggest that 'fictive kinship'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blacks are therefore targets for police discrimination, though what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; media reports is typically when this profiling results in a 'raceless'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black being stopped or detained.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So if you're a well-dressed black person, who might be identified as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'raceless', your possible attackers could be a) muggers, b) white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racists looking to beat you senseless, or c) 'fictive kinship' blacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that regard you as a collaborator. Of a, b, and c I gather the smallest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group is b. If muggers are mixed evenly by race, then there are still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more black people to fear than white people.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds good, but criticism is needed.
<br>
