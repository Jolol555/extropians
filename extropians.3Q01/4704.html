<em>&gt; Alternatives do exist in public schools.  In Seattle there are many &quot;magnet&quot;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; drama, science, and the like).  Public schools can certainly be better, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have anything against private schools, particularly - I just haven't
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Seattle enjoys the benefits of a generally better than average run
<br>
school system that is more responsive to its customers than most. Giving
<br>
parents choice is not to help parents in such situations, it is for
<br>
parents and children who are trapped in school systems that are abysmal
<br>
failures. I can guarantee that if we all moved to Seattle to take
<br>
advantage of that school system, it would quickly devolve into a mess.
<br>
<p>However, Seattle is not perfect. For example, totally irrespective of
<br>
the educational needs of the child, the Seattle system will forcibly bus
<br>
your kids to some school across town to satisfy some benighted idea
<br>
called 'racial school integration', when the families themselves (both
<br>
black and white) actively choose to not live near each other.

<em>&gt; My son, too, started to read at two.  By kindergarten he was reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything he could get his hands on (he went to public school, but he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basically taught himself in the subjects which interested him).  He was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great one with computers, and has had an array of them from the time he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very young, and now makes his living in the tech industry.  With the advent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of self-directed learning (through technology), public schools can fit each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual student's talents, make learning more stimulating than ever, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe blur the line between private and public schools even more (assuming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a discernable line now).  That's where I believe all education is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heading - to the vast array of options available to stimulate, teach and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entertain children, as well as adults, throughout their lives.  And in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology - this is where public schools could do a great service in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introducing poor children to technology - children who may not have access
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to computers at home, for instance.  Computers are like the new books
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (although, I'm not suggesting doing away with books - as my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overrun-with-books-house could attest).
