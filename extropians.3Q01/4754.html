<p><p>I'm sure it is influenced somewhat by genetics as to what works well and
<br>
what doesn't.  I happen to have a very stable metabolic system that doesn't
<br>
really overreact to anything, so I'm lucky in that respect.  My weight loss
<br>
wasn't huge (five pounds), but that was counter-balanced by an aggressive
<br>
resistance training schedule, so I probably added some muscle mass at the
<br>
same time.  What *was* obvious is that the couple pockets of noticeable fat
<br>
on my body practically evaporated in front of my eyes, ones that had been
<br>
stubbornly resistant for years.
