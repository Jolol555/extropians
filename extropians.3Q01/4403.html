Robert writes, to Scientific American, about Whitesides' article
<br>
at <a href="http://www.sciam.com/2001/0901issue/0901whitesides.html">http://www.sciam.com/2001/0901issue/0901whitesides.html</a>:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First, Dr. Whitesides states,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;The flagellar motor does not act by using electric current
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   to generate moving magnetic fields; instead it uses the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   decomposition of ATP to cause changes in the shape of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   molecules that, when combined with a sophisticated molecular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   ratchet, makes the protein shaft revolve.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately this is incorrect.  As [1, pgs 447-450, 2] document,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the flagellum is a hydrogen ion driven motor.  It only uses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ATP to perform its protein export functions.
</em><br>
<p>Robert is right, but I don't think this small technical error
<br>
invalidates Whitesides' argument.  His lead-in sentence was &quot;The
<br>
similarity between flagellar and electrical motors is, however, largely
<br>
illusory.&quot;  While he was wrong about ATP, his basic point was correct
<br>
that unlike macro-scale motors, the flagellar motor is not magnetic.
<br>
It is apparently electrostatic, and/or may rely on changes in shapes of
<br>
proteins; the details are not known.
<br>
<p>Also, the proton gradient itself is presumably maintained by molecular
<br>
pumps powered by ATP, so there is a sense in which Whitesides' statement
<br>
can be interpreted as being correct.
<br>
<p>(Coincidentally I found an article pointing out another connection:
<br>
the ATP synthase engine is apparently evolved from the flagellar motor,
<br>
including a rotor and everything,
<br>
<a href="http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/genbio/olc_linkedcontent/raven_updates/08update_text.html">http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/genbio/olc_linkedcontent/raven_updates/08update_text.html</a>).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Second, Dr. Whitesides attempts to make the case against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanosubmarines as &quot;ships approximately 100 nanometers in scale&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps because the National Science Foundation is defining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;nanotechnology&quot; at that scale.  To the best of my knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no one who is serious about the feasibility of molecular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnology has ever suggested that nanobots would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that size.  People who are familiar with the literature know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that 100 nm is the size of a nanoassembler arm [3, pg 401 &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4, pg 14] and the existant serious design studies for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanobots [5,6,7] describe them as ~1 micron in size, approximately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same size as a typical bacteria or mitochondria.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That would be 1000 times the volume and mass of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanosubmarines that Dr. Whitesides imagines.
</em><br>
<p>I think it would be relevant here to list the specific criticisms that
<br>
Whitesides made based on this misconception of submarine size, in order
<br>
to show that they would not be relevant.  It seemed that the main point
<br>
made by Whitesides with regards to the size of the submarine was the
<br>
difficulty in navigation due to Brownian motion.
<br>
<p>These issues are considered at length in Nanomedicine.  Whitesides is
<br>
right that the sub would have to use something like a helical screw
<br>
similar in concept to the bacterial flagellum rather than a conventional
<br>
propellor, as the effective viscosity of the fluids are enormous at that
<br>
size scale.
<br>
<p>However he is wrong about the Brownian effects since the subs would be
<br>
much larger than he assumes.  Also, Freitas suggests that the nanobots
<br>
would be able to travel at 1 cm/sec (100 times faster than the 100-200
<br>
microns per second of sperm).  This is fast enough to negotiate
<br>
capillaries and small blood vessels without much difficulty.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, his arguments regarding the locomotion, detection abilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and energy sources for nanobots demonstrate a lack of knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the large body of work that has been done on such topics [8].
</em><br>
<p>Your references rely pretty heavily on Freitas.  Another article I like
<br>
is Merkle's hydrocarbon metabolism,
<br>
<a href="http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/hydroCarbonMetabolism.html">http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/hydroCarbonMetabolism.html</a>, which is the
<br>
best article I've seen to address the &quot;grabbing atoms&quot; issue.  He shows
<br>
specific molecular structures for reactive tools which can be used to
<br>
add or remove hydrogen and carbon atoms, as well as to build more of
<br>
the tools.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While I could write a more extended critique, I think my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point is clear.  If Scientific American wants a &quot;scientific&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critique of the applications of molecular nanotechnology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they should seek out writers who have read the literature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The editors should also have articles containing information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding microbiology or medicine reviewed by experts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in those fields, particularly when they are written by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone whose primary expertise is chemistry.  An essay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; providing some other examples of why it is dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to place too high a value on scientists speaking outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their areas of expertise may be found in [9].
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure this article of yours,
<br>
<a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Critiques/WSOT.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Critiques/WSOT.html</a>, is a good idea
<br>
to bring into the discussion.  You start off criticizing Stephen
<br>
Hawking for expressing some very common beliefs about hypothetical
<br>
extra-terrestrials, and you offer your own theory that ETs might not
<br>
seek to expand their territory.  As you know from discussions here,
<br>
very few people find this argument compelling.  It's not IMO a very
<br>
good example of why scientists can't be trusted outside their field,
<br>
since it's not a case where most people will agree that the scientist
<br>
was wrong.  (The second example in your article, Drake's opinions on
<br>
biological longevity, works better.)
<br>
<p>I also think that this criticism of Whitesides is not quite on point;
<br>
as a chemist he is presumably speaking within his field on a number of
<br>
the issues where he was nevertheless wrong (such as the grabbing-atom
<br>
problem).  Nanobot locomation, detection capabilities and energy flow are
<br>
not medical issues.  Freitas discusses them only to set the groundwork
<br>
for his later analyses.  I'm not sure what field they fall into, but
<br>
chemistry is probably about as close as you'll get today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Scientific American should resist attempts to fan the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animosities between the believers and disbelievers in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; molecular nanotechnology.  Why?  Because if, and I realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its a big if, the believers happen to be right, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misconstructed arguments of the disbelievers happen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be wrong, the costs in premature deaths due to delays in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the development of the full vision outlined by Drexler [10]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are in excess of 53 million human lives -- *each* year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is greater than the combined military and civilian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; losses in all of World War II.  Think about that.
</em><br>
<p>SciAm is publishing both sides of the issue, a traditional approach to
<br>
getting at the truth.  I don't think it is fair to characterize this as
<br>
fanning animosities, or to ask them to stop.  Consider an AIDS skeptic
<br>
making a similar appeal to stop printing articles claiming that HIV
<br>
causes AIDS, with an emotional point about the number of people dying
<br>
from the disesase every year.  It's unfortunate that people have to die,
<br>
but the solution to that is to seek the truth.  That may inherently
<br>
involve exposing controversies to the light of day, so that people can
<br>
respond openly to criticism.
