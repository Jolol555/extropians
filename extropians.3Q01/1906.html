<em>&gt; Get real. We cannot build an orbital tower made of carbon nanotubes at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present, but that does not imply that the intelligence needed to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this hard engineering feat is beyond current human intelligence - the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem is simply a lack of certain material technologies.  The fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the hardware to run an upload is extreme does not imply that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need superintelligence to build it. The same could just as well be said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the pentium processor.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Get real&quot;? You're the one indulging in imaginary technology, not me. The
<br>
hardware to run a full human upload is beyond anyone's ability to build right
<br>
now, and that's why I referred to it as powerful technology. You seem rather
<br>
touchy about this for some reason. Oh well. I'm sure you'll get over it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think you do not understand what computational neuroscientists are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing right now. The hard part of the above scheme is not the runtime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, we have the essentials in the form of compartment simulations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and chemical models already - they can in principle be scaled up, and do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not contain any smarts except solving a lot of coupled differential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equations numerically. Understanding the brain enough to create this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of model does not require superintelligence, just a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dilligent research to dig up data like ionic conductances and time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constants of all ion channels of a particular type of neuron.
</em><br>
<p>Terrific! So if you can create this kind of model, why not engineer something
<br>
even better than a human brain? After all, human brains are inferior to
<br>
machine intelligence in some ways.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Intelligence helps, but it is the collective intelligence of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuroscientific community rather than any part of the uploading system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per se. The pattern-recognition system is the part that would require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most smarts, since it needs to be able to determine the 3D
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morphology of membranes and convert that into a compartment model. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are already software doing something like this, and this is likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an area where a brute force approch could work.
</em><br>
<p>Wouldn't a 3D computer help in this regard?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sure, build one and I will believe you. But your own criticism of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading applies to UIMs too, and since you most likely clearly see why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is wrong in that case, I hope you can extend the analogy to uploading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too.
</em><br>
<p>Same here: build one and I will concede that you can upload yourself. A UIM is
<br>
infinitely more valuable than an upload, because it will be the last thing
<br>
humans ever need to invent. Uploads are merely appeals to the egoists.

analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, and ego.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)

<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most

regressive force now operating in society.
