<em>&gt; I just joined this list after Amara Angelica from KurzweilAI pointed out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there was some talk about GAC in this group. I've looked at some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posts and would like to make some comments:
</em><br>
<p>Chris, since you have probably already read Eliezer's comments
<br>
(if you haven't you should follow the links from extropy.org
<br>
to the archives of the last week or so), I'll simply comment
<br>
that some of us are fairly neutral regarding approaches to
<br>
different aspects of AI (and will freely admit our lack of
<br>
knowledge with regard to much of it).
<br>
<p>So, stating my ignorance in advance, I'll simply make a few comments
<br>
on your comments:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 1 - GAC is a black box. I have made no disclosures on what it uses for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pattern matching [snip]
</em><br>
<p>While I can understand reasons for doing this, it will leave a bad
<br>
taste in the mouths of many with an academic or open source perspectives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2 - The primary purpose of GAC is to build a fitness test for humanness in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; binary response domain. This will in the future allow GAC to babysit a truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolving artificial consciousness, rewarding and punishing it as needed at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine speeds.
</em><br>
<p>I'd say this statement is flawed from two perspectives.  First, if you
<br>
have no verifiction of the &quot;reputation&quot; of your &quot;humanness&quot; sources you
<br>
have no controls on the results.  You are going to get much different
<br>
results if your humans are Jesuit priests vs. modern-day neo-nazis.
<br>
Presumably you get a slightly more intelligent and affluent cross
<br>
section of humanity (i.e. the people net-connected and producing
<br>
the inputs to your system).  That would seem to imply you are going
<br>
to get a pretty &quot;average&quot; human perspective out of the whole effort.
<br>
Producing more &quot;average&quot; humans isn't of much use from an extropian
<br>
perspective.  We have more than enough problems figuring out how to
<br>
feed the ones produced using the regular old-fashioned manufacturing
<br>
methods.  Second, there seems to be an implicit assumption that using
<br>
current &quot;humaneness&quot; can evolve an artificial consciousness.  Leaving
<br>
aside the meaning of the suitcase term &quot;consciousness&quot;, the
<br>
problem may be that for humans to have reached that state they
<br>
had to go through their entire evolutionary history.  Modern humans,
<br>
not knowing how to chip flint or stalk a mammoth, may not be able
<br>
to regenerate &quot;consciousness&quot;.  All you may end up with is a machine
<br>
able to pass the Turing test, but still not be &quot;conscious&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Right now, GAC is a 50,000+ term fitness test for humanness. At each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of those points GAC knows what it should expect it were testing an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average human, because for each one of those points GAC has made at least 20
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measurements of real people.
</em><br>
<p>That's 20 real &quot;average&quot; people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3 - Any contradictions in GAC are real contradictions in us. It can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe anything that hasn't been confirmed by at least 20 people.
</em><br>
<p>You can get 20 real average people to confirm a belief in God --
<br>
getting a combination of a database and some statistical analysis
<br>
software to do the same doesn't make God any more &quot;real&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4 - GAC is science. Over 8 million actual measurements of human consensus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been made.  There are at least two other projects that claim to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collecting human consensus information - CYC and Open Mind [snip]
</em><br>
<p>I don't know much about Open Mind, and only know a little more about Cyc.
<br>
I would not classify Cyc as trying to collect human &quot;consensus&quot; information.
<br>
Human &quot;consensus&quot; information is often wrong and I doubt Doug would be
<br>
building wrong concepts into a common sense database.  I'd classify Cyc
<br>
more of an attempt to get the commonly agreed upon as scientifically correct
<br>
information into a database with an attached reasoning and inference engine.
<br>
<p>I would agree that GAC may be interesting social science, but I
<br>
deeply doubt it will produce a useful path to an advanced
<br>
artificial intelligence.  Since an advanced artificial intelligence
<br>
is what most extropians would find of interest, the approach
<br>
isn't likely to find a warm reception here.  (But you probably
<br>
have already figured that out...).  What might be interesting
<br>
at some future point in time is to watch a Turing test between
<br>
Cyc and GAC.  It could reveal some very interesting insights
<br>
into the many false beliefs that most people hold.
<br>
<p>I'd suggest you consider the problem of how one would build into
<br>
GAC the concepts of &quot;trust&quot; and &quot;reputations&quot;.  A quick search
<br>
turns up:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Production of Trust in Online Markets&quot; by Peter Kollock

<br>
which references some of the early work by Miller &amp; Drexler.
<br>
<p>I've got little interest in knowing what the average human knows.
<br>
I've got a great interest in knowing what &quot;high&quot; reputation
<br>
humans know.
