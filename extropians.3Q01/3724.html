<p><em>&gt;In the 70's, 80's and 90's it's possible that the PC
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crowd over did things... but equality of opportunity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for blacks and whites is still mostly a myth white
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people tell themselves.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps.  But I think blacks (and I am one remember) do need to take more 
<br>
responsibility for making their own opportunities.  Frankly, I think the 
<br>
biggest (though not the only) problem for blacks is poor choices.
<br>
<p>Every black person I know who went out and worked hard for an education and 
<br>
diligently pursued a career has been at least moderately successful.  I do 
<br>
have some friends and family who sadly have been mostly unsuccessful in 
<br>
their careers and in their lives.  But this has almost universally been due 
<br>
to poor choices, rather than &quot;the white man&quot; standing in their way.
<br>
<p>Of course I'm the first to admit I was very lucky in the sense that both my 
<br>
parents were well educated professionals who placed a great emphasis on the 
<br>
importance of education and hard work.  I had the most important thing I 
<br>
think anybody can have, good role models.  If I never knew my Dad, and if my 
<br>
Mom was single and on welfare I'm sure I would have turned out much 
<br>
differently.  I think what the black community needs more than monetary 
<br>
reparations or affirmative action is more positisve role models like my 
<br>
folks.
<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
