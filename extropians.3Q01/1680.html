<p><p>I've seen a detailed sequence of photos of the event (including a close-up
<br>
where you can actually see the security guy pointing the gun at the
<br>
extinguisher thrower) and it is pretty clear what happened, which is a
<br>
little different than what you are describing.  There are an amazing number
<br>
of detailed photographs of the incident, before, during, and after.  The
<br>
photos show something like this:
<br>
<p>1) A police jeep inadvertently gets itself cornered by a group of violent
<br>
protestors.
<br>
<p>2) Protestors aggressively attack the jeep and its occupants with various
<br>
bits of hardware.  The police try to get the hell out of dodge with little
<br>
success, as they are trapped.
<br>
<p>3) A protestor smashes the back window the jeep with a fire extinguisher and
<br>
apparently is going to attempt to smash the security guy trapped inside.
<br>
While this is going on other security people in the vehicle are being
<br>
physically assaulted.
<br>
<p>4) The security guy inside draws his gun and points it at the protestor.
<br>
The protestor either doesn't see the gun pointed at him or ignores it,
<br>
continuing his attack.
<br>
<p>5)  The security plugs the protestor.  The protestors scatter.  The police
<br>
don't wait around for the encore and drive over the body to untrap their
<br>
vehicle.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;From everything I've seen, it would probably be ruled justifiable in most

U.S. jurisdictions.
