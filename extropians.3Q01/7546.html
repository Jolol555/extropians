Hmmm... wouldn't the biggest problem for long distance, ballistic, 
<br>
subterranean trains (apart from digging the tunnels) be the danger of 
<br>
faults breaking the tunnels? It might not be too much of a problem if you 
<br>
keep to a single continental plate (though even there you might come into 
<br>
risk at some spots), but I definitely wouldn't want to be crossing under 
<br>
any oceans past the sea-floor spreading points and subduction zones... 
<br>
unless you had some way of protecting against molten rock, then maybe you 
<br>
could venture down into the mantle. However that would bring other problems 
<br>
because the mantle moves relative to the crust -- not sure at what speed, 
<br>
but I think it's a fair bit faster than the centimeters a year that the 
<br>
plates move relative to each other.
<br>
<p>The crust is about 32km thick under land and 10km under the seas, so maybe 
<br>
there wouldn't be any need to go down to the mantle. If you wanted to go 
<br>
really long distances you could have switching stations at the surface to 
<br>
take you further after your first stop. And I guess any people capable of 
<br>
boring such long holes could probably maintain them at stress points... 
<br>
except during earthquakes, then maybe you would take a journey around while 
<br>
they cleaned up the mess.
<br>
<p>Hmmm... you would get seismic reports instead of weather reports:
<br>
<p>[ding] &quot;Attention passengers for the subtrain from Cairns to Tokyo: today's 
<br>
seismic report has necessitated rerouting of your 9:15 connection. The 
<br>
train will surface at Osaka instead, from where you will be able to take 
<br>
the 10:35 HST to Tokyo. Please accept our apologies for this unfortunate 
<br>
but unavoidable change, and we hope that you choose to travel with DogStar 
<br>
Firetrains again in the future. You safety is always our priority.&quot; [ding]
<br>
<p>Heheheh.  :-)
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
