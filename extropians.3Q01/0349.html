According to GE, a 15-watt compact fluorescent bulb can replace a 60-watt
<br>
incandescent bulb. That's because more of the energy is converted into light
<br>
instead of heat. <a href="http://www.ge.com/athcf3.htm">http://www.ge.com/athcf3.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Sage advice from Dr. Bill Wattenberg of KGO and UC Berkeley on this:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.kgoam810.com/viewentry.asp?ID=93553&PT=personalities">http://www.kgoam810.com/viewentry.asp?ID=93553&PT=personalities</a>
<br>
<p>Lighting in homes and businesses can represent 20% of energy usage. The
<br>
common incandescent light bulbs waste most of the energy they use as heat. A
<br>
typical 100-watt bulb converts less than 30% of the 100 watts used into
<br>
light. There are compact fluorescent bulbs (CFB) to replace most
<br>
incandescent bulbs. They cost more, but they last twenty times or more
<br>
longer. They are a very good investment, and you won't have to replace them
<br>
So often.
<br>
<p>One absurdity of the present energy crisis in California is that the state
<br>
legislature that caused this problem has spent more of our tax money in the
<br>
last few months than it would have cost to buy new CFB bulbs for all homes
<br>
in California. The new bulbs could save as much as 15% of total energy used
<br>
in homes. This is enough saving to avoid the stage 3 alerts that has forced
<br>
us to buy expensive power from out of state. The billions of dollars paid
<br>
for excess power is a total waste. We will never get it back. The investment
<br>
in new light bulbs would have saved every homeowner hundreds of dollars a
<br>
year forever and stopped the continuous waste of billions of our tax dollars
<br>
for high-priced power for several more years. Is this smart?
<br>
<p>Take a look at the compact fluorescent bulbs in your local hardware store or
<br>
shopping center before you buy more of the old types that you have been
<br>
buying every month. You will save a lot of money and time over just a year.
<br>
The CFB bulbs will last many years. Do the experiment. Replace one or two
<br>
light bulbs in your home that burn most of the time, such as outdoor lights.
<br>
You will be pleased.
