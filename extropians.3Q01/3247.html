</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike, that seems a fair enough comment. I think at one point you said that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'd be prepared to accept public investment in education as an exception
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to your libertarian views against taxes and public expenditure, but I may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misrepresenting you. Remind me what you think about this (it's not a problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for me because I don't believe in absolute property rights, but let's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get into that).
</em><br>
<p>I said that I think that every kid has an equal right to as much
<br>
education as they can obtain (mentally). There are obviously smart and
<br>
not smart kids, as well as motivated and unmotivated kids. The latter is
<br>
fixable, the former is not (yet).You can't have equality of opportunity
<br>
among adults unless they've all had the same opportunities for education
<br>
as kids. 
<br>
<p>Part of this is having standards for parents (i.e. liability for the
<br>
actions of their kids) to be responsible. Barbara Lamar's comments about
<br>
families having no books in the home to me seems like child abuse.
<br>
<p>I don't think that taxation and public expenditures are per se necessary
<br>
for equality in education, that each school can be funded on either a
<br>
sliding scale tuition or alumni income royalty basis (or a combination
<br>
of the two). This is a more market oriented solution that allows schools
<br>
to compete for students as well as *real* outcomes (i.e. future income),
<br>
while providing affordable quality education to all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also tend to think that knowledge and learning is the key, and you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right that it's not *just* poverty. It's poverty, under-education,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partly-justified social resentment, and culture-specific memes about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate attitudes to society, all in a vicious circle. But how do we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best turn the key? What limitations do you think your political philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imposes (I'm not disputing your philosophy at this point, just asking a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question)?
</em><br>
<p>The limitations my philosophy imposes is that it is wrong to confiscate
<br>
people's property to fund things they never use, or don't use to the
<br>
level they are paying. My philosophy also says that holding children,
<br>
grand children, and great grandchildren accountable for the actions of
<br>
their ancestors is similarly wrong. My philosophy also says that the
<br>
market, acting without the coersion of government, will always find the
<br>
optimum solution.
