<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
JAMA publishes letters in defense of St John's Wort for depression
<br>
<p>This week's Journal of the American Medical Association published several
<br>
letters in response to their April 18 2001 publication of a study that
<br>
indicated a lack of benefit of St John's wort for people with severe
<br>
depression.  Correspondence was published from individuals at the American
<br>
Botanical Council, Georgetown University's Department of Psychiatry, The
<br>
Council for Responsible Nutrition, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, St
<br>
John's Episcopal Hospital, the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric
<br>
Research, George Washington University School of Medicine and others.  The
<br>
study, entitled, &quot;Effectiveness of St John's Wort in Major Depression: a
<br>
randomized controlled trial,&quot; compared the effectiveness of St John's wort
<br>
to a placebo in subjects with severe depression who were treated for eight
<br>
weeks.  In this study's analysis, 26.5% of those on St John's Wort
<br>
responded to the herb compared to 18.6% of those on placebo, although
<br>
according to one definition of remission the authors listed these figures
<br>
as 14.3% compared to 4.9%.  Although the researchers concluded that St
<br>
John's wort is safe and well-tolerated, they stated that it was
<br>
ineffective for major depression, and with their usual zeal, news media
<br>
throughout the country were quick to publish one-sided headlines.
<br>
<p>One of the points emphasized by several different correspondents was the
<br>
fact that if this two hundred person study proves that St John's Wort is
<br>
not effective for the majority of  people with severe depression, the herb
<br>
works remarkably well for the large body of individuals with mild to
<br>
moderate depression, which has been demonstrated in thirty-one previous
<br>
peer-reviewed trials.  Correspondents pointed out that the trial did not
<br>
feature a group receiving conventional antidepressants which would
<br>
indicate whether the study was sensitive enough to detect effectiveness,
<br>
while others called the study design &quot;flawed&quot;, or described possible
<br>
defects in the statistical analysis.  One letter was from the authors of a
<br>
double-blind study demonstrating that St John's Wort was as effective as
<br>
the established antidepressant sertraline hydrochloride.  The authors made
<br>
note of the fact that the authors of the current study in question
<br>
criticized their study because it did not include enough people with
<br>
severe depression, yet the researchers did not set out to evaluate the
<br>
herb's effect on depression that was other than mild to moderate.
<br>
<p>Severe depression is a serious disease, with consequences that can be
<br>
life-threatening.  If you are depressed, see your doctor. Those with mild
<br>
to moderate depression, a widespread condition that effects many of us at
<br>
different points in our lives, may wish to try St John's Wort, a natural
<br>
remedy that has fewer side effects than prescription drugs.  (With St
<br>
John's Wort, as with any other substance, there are some instances in
<br>
which it should not be used.  Read about these in the &quot;Featured Products
<br>
of the Week&quot; section below and click the link to the product description.)
<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
<p>The many and varied symptoms of endogenous depression may include:
<br>
<p>Profound, persistent sadness
<br>
Profound, persistent irritability
<br>
Unexplained crying
<br>
Loss of self-esteem
<br>
Feelings of hopelessness
<br>
Feelings of pessimism
<br>
Feelings of helplessness
<br>
Feelings of worthlessness
<br>
Feelings of guilt
<br>
Feelings of emptiness
<br>
Continually mulling over the past, reviewing the errors you've made.
<br>
Changes in sleeping patterns
<br>
Changes in eating habits
<br>
Unexplained weight gain or loss
<br>
Restlessness
<br>
Fatigue
<br>
A &quot;slow down&quot; in physical movements
<br>
Inability to concentrate
<br>
Memory difficulties.
<br>
Difficulty making decisions
<br>
Loss of interest in usually pleasurable activities
<br>
Loss of interest in sex
<br>
Unexplained headaches, stomach upset, or other physical problems that are
<br>
not helped with standard treatment
<br>
Thoughts of suicide or death
<br>
Suicide attempts
<br>
<p>The symptoms may come in any combination. They can build gradually or
<br>
strike hard and fast. Some of the symptoms may manifest as either too much
<br>
or too little of the same thing. Mildly depressed people, for example, may
<br>
gain weight as they seek comfort in favorite foods, and those suffering
<br>
from more profound depression may lose weight as their appetites are
<br>
deadened by sadness. Sleep patterns also may be affected this way. Some
<br>
depressed people have difficulty falling or staying asleep, while others
<br>
sleep more than usual but awaken feeling tired.
<br>
<p>In Germany, where it is covered by health insurance as a prescription
<br>
drug, some 20 million people take hypericum for depression. Hypericum's
<br>
side effects are very mild, and may include slight gastrointestinal
<br>
irritation and fatigue. In one study involving more than 1000 patients,
<br>
hypericum produced fewer side effects than a placebo.  Some types of
<br>
depression, such as severe, debilitating depression and bipolar depression
<br>
(also known as manic depressive illness), do not respond to hypericum.
<br>
Indeed, these are very difficult problems to treat even with standard
<br>
antidepressants.

FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>St John's Wort
<br>
<p>St. John's Wort (hypericum extract) has been widely studied for its
<br>
antidepressant properties and is widely prescribed in Europe in lieu of
<br>
expensive, side-effect prone drugs.
<br>
<p>In a report published in the British Medical Journal (Dec 11, 1999), St.
<br>
John's Wort was shown to be equally effective to a tricyclic
<br>
antidepressant drug (imipramine) in treating depression. This study
<br>
compared the effects of St. John's Wort, imipramine, or placebo on 283
<br>
moderately depressed people. After eight weeks, the doctors found that St.
<br>
John's Wort alleviated depression symptoms significantly more than the
<br>
placebo and just as well as the anti-depressant drug. St. John's Wort has
<br>
proven to be exceptionally safe for healthy people to take.
<br>
<p>Cautions:
<br>
St. John's Wort should not be taken with MAO (monoamine oxidase)
<br>
inhibitors.
<br>
<p>Use caution when initiating St. John's Wort if SSRIs such as Prozac,
<br>
Paxil, and Zoloft are being taken.
<br>
<p>St. John's Wort may reduce the availability of certain prescription drugs
<br>
such as the anti-HIV drug, Indinavir.
<br>
<p>St. John's Wort may cause increased skin sensitivity to UV light.
<br>
<p>Do not take St. John's Wort if you are taking any other prescription
<br>
drugs.  See:

<p>TMG tablets
<br>
<p>When a TMG methyl group is donated to a molecule of homocysteine, it is
<br>
converted first to methionine then to S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe). No
<br>
&quot;safe&quot; level of homocysteine has been established, suggesting that taking
<br>
nutrients like TMG could lower the risk of heart attack and stroke, in
<br>
addition to protecting DNA.
<br>
<p>Two to five tablets daily are suggested for healthy people.
<br>
<p>Six to twelve tablets daily may be taken under the care of a physician to
<br>
treat liver failure or depression. If muscle tension or headaches occur,
<br>
reduce dosage.
<br>
<p>TMG should be taken with co-factor vitamins B6 and B12, and folic acid.

<p>Book
<br>
Hypericum &amp; Depression
<br>
<p>Hypericum is the herb hypericum perforatum, also known as St John's Wort.
<br>
Hypericum has been used for thousands of years as a medicine.  In
<br>
Hypericum &amp; Depression, two noted psychiatrists report on the recent
<br>
medical research that could change the way depression is treated in
<br>
America.  (In Germany, hypericum accounts for more than fifty percent of
<br>
the antidepressant market.  Prozac has two percent.)
<br>
<p>In a simple, straight-forward style, the authors explain what depression
<br>
is, how to know if one is depressed, the medical effects of hypericum on
<br>
depression, and where to find research-grade hypericum.
