<p>It will only occur so long as we continue to buy into pathetic excuses
<br>
of moral equivalency.
<br>
<p>I must say that I am greatly heartened by the degree to which NATO
<br>
countries have offered their support. For all of the brotherly sniping
<br>
that occurs between the US and other eurosphere countries, the statement
<br>
of NATO about article 5, that this is an attack on all NATO countries,
<br>
and the EU statements as well, demonstrates to all Americans that Europe
<br>
does not take our past assistance for granted. It demonstrates the great
<br>
level of trust and appreciation that has been forged over the decades
<br>
with european countries and cultures, and I'm sure that many europeans
<br>
are similarly proud of having this opportunity to come to our assistance
<br>
in the way that we have done for them in the past. For this, I thank
<br>
every european and citizen of a NATO country on the list.
<br>
<p>With the recent integration of eastern european nations into NATO, this
<br>
will also prove a great opportunity for the newly democratic nations to
<br>
forge new martial traditions, to earn the respect and gratitude of all
<br>
freedom loving peoples, and to demonstrate a determined commitment to
<br>
freedom in the crucible of conflict that I think we are going to see
<br>
over the next several years.
<br>
<p>I am glad that the Bush administration is now asserting that the time
<br>
has come to root out ALL terrorist organizations around the world, and
<br>
to demand that all governments abdicate support for such groups.
<br>
<p>The other day, when I turned on the TV to watch the second plane strike
<br>
the World Trade Center, I thought that this was an attack by the
<br>
anti-globalists, the luddites. After all, the Trade Center is the symbol
<br>
of the globalization of trade which the luddites are so adamantly
<br>
against, and coupled with the attack on the Pentagon, when these same
<br>
groups tend to be so adamantly against US military spending, and against
<br>
US military support of peacekeeping actions overseas. 
<br>
<p>In a very real sense, this expectation is still accurate. In my
<br>
investigations of these groups, they have frequently ferried propaganda
<br>
for middle eastern groups against the US, including excuses and
<br>
rationalizations for the acts of bin Laden. Bin Laden is also certainly
<br>
to be considered an anti-globalist. His primary motivation is to fight
<br>
against the spread of western culture and influence in the muslim world,
<br>
and especially in Saudi Arabia, the home of the holy cities of Mecca and
<br>
Medina. The muslim fundamentalism that he espouses, being the son of a
<br>
family of high ranking Wahabi clerics (the Wahabis being the spiritual
<br>
allies of the royal Saud family as it came to power), is one that can
<br>
easily be seen as luddite in nature.
<br>
<p>A classic story of the luddite conflict in Saudi lands dates back to the
<br>
1920's and the introduction of the telephone to Arabia. The Wahabi
<br>
clerics were adamantly set against this technology as a tool of satan.
<br>
King Abdul Azziz outmaneuvered them by speaking words of the Quran
<br>
through the phone, concluding that a tool of satan could not transmit
<br>
the words of the Quran accurately.
<br>
<p>Ever since, the Wahabis have been fighting tooth and nail against
<br>
incursions of technology and western modern culture. They run the
<br>
'morality police' that was so hostile to US forces (especially female
<br>
soldiers) in the Gulf War. Bin Laden is merely one of the more vocal
<br>
radical ones, forced into exile by the Saudi family, his family still
<br>
supports him, as does a large amount of the Wahabis in Arabia.
