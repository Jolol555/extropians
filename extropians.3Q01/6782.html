Fortunately we can now see that this Afghan-American fellow appears to
<br>
have been wrong about Pakistan, at least so far.  I was quite concerned,
<br>
as well, that Pakistan wouldn't cooperate with the US.  On that point,
<br>
I think we are fortunate that the country is currently ruled by a (secular)
<br>
military dictator, as opposed to the Islamic Prime Minister he overthrew,
<br>
Nawaz Sharif. 
<br>
<p>No one likes a dictatorship, military or otherwise, of course, but there
<br>
are slim odds that Sharif would have supported the US in a conflict with
<br>
Afghanistan.  He is an Islamic fundamentalist, and while in power made
<br>
no secret of his intentions to forcibly convert Pakistan to an Islamic
<br>
state with Sharia law, not unlike Afghanistan under the Taliban.
<br>
<p>I remember when he announced his intentions, in 1999.  I was spending
<br>
a lot of time in India at the time, and could almost feel a national
<br>
shudder as Sharif showed himself to be a religious zealot and thug (with
<br>
awful consequences for regional stability and especially the Kashmir
<br>
issue).  We shouldn't forget, either, that it was Sharif's government
<br>
which set off the nuclear detonations which led many to (rightly) worry
<br>
more about regional stability.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I'm not sure this Afghan fellow is right when he asserts that
<br>
the Afghan people would love to see the Taliban overthrown.  I'm sure
<br>
the analogy with Jews under Hitler is a *huge* stretch, and I think it's
<br>
inappropriate, really.  Though I don't know for sure, I fear that many
<br>
Afghans actually *support* the Taliban, which of course would have major
<br>
consequences for any type of operation we try there, pointing towards
<br>
another Vietnam-type situation, especially in a ground operation.
<br>
<p>There was an article in _The New Yorker_ earlier this year, in which
<br>
the correspondent traveled to Afghanistan and found that *many* people
<br>
he spoke with seemed to genuinely support the Taliban.  I'll try to track
<br>
it down and at least post the reference; unfortunately the New Yorker's
<br>
online archive is very limited.
<br>
<p>It sounds quite odd, of course, to hear that *anyone* in Afghanistan
<br>
could support a brutish, oppressive regime like the Taliban.  However
<br>
we have to keep in mind that: 
<br>
a, many of the citizens are themselves Islamic fundamentalists
<br>
and b, the people went through hell fighting off the Soviet invasion.
<br>
&nbsp;Whatever else the Taliban are, compared to fighting the Soviets they
<br>
have offered at least a measure of stability, as well as self-(Afghan
<br>
as opposed to Soviet) rule, and they're running the country in accordance
<br>
with strict Islamic law, which many people there *want*.  
<br>
<p>I shouldn't throw the word &quot;many&quot; around too lightly, because national
<br>
surveys and such evidence is nonexistant.  However, I think it's very
<br>
safe to say that the number of Afghans who support the Taliban in a deep
<br>
way is not insignificant.
<br>
<p>Best to all,
<br>
<p>Bill
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I've been hearing a lot of talk about &quot;bombing Afghanistan back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Stone Age.&quot; Ronn Owens, on KGO Talk Radio today, allowed that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this would mean killing innocent people, people who had nothing to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with this atrocity, but &quot;we're at war, we have to accept collateral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;damage. What else can we do?&quot; Minutes later I heard some TV pundit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussing whether we &quot;have the belly to do what must be done.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt;am from Afghanistan, and even though I've lived here for 35 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I've never lost track of what's going on there. So I want to tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyone who will listen how it all looks from where I'm standing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. There is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in New York. I agree that something must be done about those monsters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan. They're not even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the government of Afghanistan. The Taliban are a cult of ignorant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;psychotics who took over Afghanistan in 1997. Bin Laden is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political criminal with a plan. When you think Taliban, think Nazis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When you think Bin Laden, think Hitler. And when you think &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people of Afghanistan&quot; think &quot;the Jews in the concentration camps.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;atrocity. They were the first victims of the perpetrators. They would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exult if someone would come in there, take out the Taliban and clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Some say, why don't the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The answer is, they're starved, exhausted, hurt, incapacitated,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suffering. A few years ago, the United Nations estimated that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are 500,000 disabled orphans in Afghanistan--a country with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economy, no food. There are millions of widows. And the Taliban has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been burying these widows alive in mass graves. The soil is littered
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with land mines, the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets. These
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are a few of the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Taliban.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Age. Trouble is, that's been done. The Soviets took care of it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already. Make the Afghans suffer? They're already suffering. Level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their houses? Done. Turn their schools into piles of rubble? Done.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Eradicate their hospitals? Done. Destroy their infrastructure? Cut
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them off from medicine and health care? Too late. Someone already did
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs. Would they at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least get the Taliban? Not likely. In today's Afghanistan, only the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Taliban eat, only they have the means to move around. They'd slip
</em><br>
<em>&gt;away and hide. Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled
</em><br>
<em>&gt;orphans, they don't move too fast, they don't even have wheelchairs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldn't really be a strike
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against the criminals who did this horrific thing. Actually it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only be making common cause with the Taliban--by raping once again
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the people they've been raping all this time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So what else is there? What can be done, then? Let me now speak with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;true fear and trembling. The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there with ground troops. When people speak of &quot;having the belly to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do what needs to be done&quot; they're thinking in terms of having the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;belly to kill as many as needed. Having the belly to overcome any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moral qualms about killing innocent people. Let's pull our heads out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the sand. What's actually on the table is Americans dying. And not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just because some Americans would die fighting their way through
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Afghanistan to Bin Laden's hideout. It's much bigger than that folks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Because to get any troops to Afghanistan, we'd have to go through
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Pakistan. Would they let us? Not likely. The conquest of Pakistan
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would have to be first. Will other Muslim nations just stand by? You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;see where I'm going. We're flirting with a world war between Islam
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the West.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And guess what: that's Bin Laden's program. That's exactly what he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wants. That's why he did this. Read his speeches and statements. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all right there. He really believes Islam would beat the west. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might seem ridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into Islam and the West, he's got a billion soldiers. If the west
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wreaks a holocaust in those lands, that's a billion people with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing left to lose, that's even better from Bin Laden's point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;view. He's probably wrong, in the end the west would win, whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that would mean, but the war would last for years and millions would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;die, not just theirs but ours. Who has the belly for that? Bin Laden
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does. Anyone else?
