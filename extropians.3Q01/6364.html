Hi all,
<br>
<p>I think it would be useful to see what was written by a woman in France. 
<br>
She posted to Faces, a women's list that I have been subscribed to for some 
<br>
years now. English is not her native language so please be patient. She has 
<br>
some important insights to give.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Miriam

Subject: [faces] we are all arabicans
<br>
<p>Dear faces
<br>
<p>I hope you and your friends and relatives are all safe. And I want to 
<br>
virtually hug all those who are in NY and Manhattan. I hope you can cope 
<br>
with this nightmare. I hardly can though I am far away, in a tiny french 
<br>
village with no TV. Until today I was shocked, sick, my body and brain 
<br>
aching. Properly out of my shoes.
<br>
<p>Because, apart from the human drama, since this terrible 911 day, I've been
<br>
trying to hear something through the endless loop distillated by mass-medias.
<br>
<p>But I did not hear it. At least until today.
<br>
<p>The rest of the net I know, my tribe as Rachel said, seems to have disappeared.
<br>
<p>The scream of silence hurts.
<br>
<p>I read this &quot;something&quot; here, and only here. Not a fear, but a deep concern.
<br>
About what has happened, but above all about what is going to or could happen
<br>
and must not happen. Not looking for the criminals and how to punish them, but
<br>
caring about the victims, actual and future.
<br>
<p>Maybe I am too demanding but why are the announced multitudes so silent? Is 
<br>
it too early? Too early to say to all those fierce leaders that we don't 
<br>
want eye for eye and blood for blood.
<br>
<p>Too early to say that we are all arabs, or arabicans, and we are not 
<br>
dancing on dead bodies. These images of Palestine are part of the 
<br>
media-war-machine. They are nothing but a small part of reality, the rest 
<br>
beeing dissimulated, erased, because it does not serve the propaganda. In a 
<br>
smart intended counter effect, Arafat gave his blood and the image was this 
<br>
morning in our newspapers and we learned that hundreds of palestinians have 
<br>
done the same. Does this information reach american homes ?
<br>
<p>People on the radio here start talking of the obvious guilty behavior of 
<br>
arab kids. And of the importance of not overreacting and not assimilating 
<br>
groups of fanatics and islamic countries. But at the same time, USA already 
<br>
has NATO&quot;blanc-seing&quot;, comforted by yesterday polls figures, done and 
<br>
published in emergency. The question was &quot;are you supporting the 
<br>
americans?&quot; Of course the answer was 90 something %. Today's polls question 
<br>
was &quot;are you against a possible extension of the conflict?&quot; the answer of 
<br>
course was 80% yes. What would be the answer to &quot;Are you aware that the 
<br>
modification of NATO's article 5 is a possible extension of the conflict?&quot;
<br>
<p>Is it too early or already too late to say that we don't want NATO to 
<br>
decide in place of United Nations. We want states to sit around a table and 
<br>
find a solution not enhance the problem. And before our leaders decide, we 
<br>
want them to take the public opinions into account.We don't want any 
<br>
Restore Desert Storm, because we have no economical and human interests 
<br>
into it.
<br>
<p>We all know who we oppose, whatever we call it: militaro-industrial complex,
<br>
corporate globalisation, ultra-liberalism, capitalism, or else. So why are we
<br>
not all standing and asking for what we want, for what is necessary and maybe
<br>
even not sufficient to preserve what is left from our blue orange: peace 
<br>
and equity.
<br>
<p>Am I such a dreamer? Can we do it ? If not what else ? Europe is marching 
<br>
as one man behind US. Whatever &quot;they&quot; decide to strike, they will 
<br>
strengthen global surveillance, they will snoop every possible thing, they 
<br>
will assimilate those who are not pro-global economy to anti-americans or 
<br>
&quot;anti-civilized&quot;, therefore pro-terrorists. Sorry Nathalie to be 
<br>
pessimistic but Cybercrime treaties and such will be very convenient to 
<br>
discourage, dismantle and neutralize those who plead and manifest for 
<br>
another world. And point at them not as political opponents but trouble 
<br>
makers and criminals. I am exagerating a bit the trait, maybe, but not so much.
<br>
<p>As Joelle Palmieri put it
<br>
<em> &gt;how can we oppose to this war atmosphere?
</em><br>
<em> &gt; i think that we have to enter in a resistance phasis.
</em><br>
<p>I do too, and I would add quickly
<br>
Sorry for beeing so long and I hope my english is good enough not to induce
<br>
misunderstandings on such complex matters.
<br>
<p>Warm hugs to you on the other side of the Atlantic
<br>
<p>Chris
