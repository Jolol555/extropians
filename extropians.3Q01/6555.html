<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; As an example in Momentum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Cartridge 44 Magnum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Caliber in Inches 0.43
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Bullet Weight in grains 240
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Muzzle Velocity in feet per second 1348
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Muzzle Energy in foot-pounds 941
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Which means there is enough energy, leaving the muzzle, for the bullet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to move 941 pounds one foot in distance. A person who is 157 pounds will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be moved 6 feet: i.e. knocked on their asses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the irony impaired on this list, I should note that Mike Lorrey is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; JOKING.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure why you say that.  He's wrong, but he doesn't seem to be
<br>
joking.  941 foot-pounds is enough energy to raise a 157 pound person
<br>
by 6 feet, but the problem is you can't turn the energy directly into
<br>
motion like that.  Most of it will be dissipated as heat if the bullet
<br>
hits something that stops it like a Kevlar vest.
<br>
<p>What you need to do is to calculate the momentum, as someone else
<br>
pointed out.  The bullet will give the man a velocity of about 1/4 foot
<br>
per second, enough to rock him back, maybe lose his balance, but not
<br>
necessarily knock him off his feet.
