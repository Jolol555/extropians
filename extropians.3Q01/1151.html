<em>&gt; The SJ Mercury News would certainly agree with you.

<p>You say this as if it's a strike against my arguments.  Is that what you mean?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The research done by Dave Redell of CPSR on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (in)feasibility of building software that would achieve the necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; claims of the SDI project are still the best reference on this subject...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...that you know of.  {8-]
</em><br>
<p>Care to propose an alternative?  Reddell and Nelson (his co-author)
<br>
engaged in numerous debates with SDI proponents when SDI was hot twenty
<br>
years ago.  If you want to see transcripts, or listen to recordings, I'm
<br>
willing to look for them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Not being able to shoot a single missle out of the air in a fair trial is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one problem,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Solved.  The Block 2 THAAD missile is 2 for 2 now.  The only 2
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firings of that version has hit both times.  Of course the Merc didnt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell you that, and they *continue* to insist that no intercepts have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been successful.
</em><br>
<p>Not in today's paper.  I didn't say a single missile could never
<br>
intercept an incoming warhead.  I said that's not the hardest problem it
<br>
has to solve to be more useful than dangerous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You did say &quot;fair.&quot;  If the intercept is successful, the Merc can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always report that the test was rigged.  If unsuccessful, its an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unworkable boondoggle.  Tomorrow's newpaper will tell.  If it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is on the front page, we missed.  If we hit, it will be buried on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p.17, a half a paragraph reporting a rigged test.
</em><br>
<p>Front page above the fold today: &quot;Missile Test Strikes Target&quot;.  I
<br>
didn't detect the significant naysaying they'd done before.  You may
<br>
have a different opinion when you read it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; but they also have to get their software to work correctly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; every time in the first battle, without any reasonable arena for evolving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it into robustness beforehand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Have we not done exactly this with the fleet ballistic missile?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We randomly choose one out of the fleet and fire it, usually 2 or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3 times a year.  The last 91 consecutive firings have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful.  Why is not the FBM analogous to the SDI?  Could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we not test the software repeatedly?  Could we not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redundancy by firing several interceptors at an incoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missile?
</em><br>
<p>Repeated tests are not the same as attempting to get three or four
<br>
different systems to cooperatively choose targets when each defensive
<br>
system can individually shoot down an individual missile a significant
<br>
fraction of the time.  So far, the system isn't above %50 when there's
<br>
one incoming, with several days warning of what the approximate
<br>
trajectory will be, and a single decoy (as I read the article today.) 
<br>
The FBM (if I understand what you're describing) is analogous to a
<br>
system that needs to shoot down a single incoming missile.  Redundancy
<br>
leads to mutual interference in missile defense.  You can't just deploy
<br>
more identical systems.  They'll all have the same priorities when
<br>
choosing incoming targets.
<br>
<p>You (and Mike) haven't responded to any of these points yet:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; in the US government, such undertakings are vastly more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political.  Getting reliable funding for any one of these for the life of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the project is problematic.  Getting funding to work on integrating the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems doesn't even make sense until some of the systems work.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; The point of a defensive system is not to eliminate every missile that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enough missiles that any actual damage done is not worth the cost of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all the lost missiles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point of a defensive system in a military theater is as you describe.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point of a population defense system against WoMD has to be to stop all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or probably all incoming missiles.  If you stop 90% of 20 missiles, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat has not been countered.  The technologies of the future will make it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheaper to deploy scores of copies of any weapon someone can test.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Incoming missiles don't have to coordinate their actions.  A coalition of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defensive systems do have to coordinate, and this is one of the hardest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems if you have to be close to %100 successful to be useful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hostile powers work on developing weapons of mass destruction because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are economical means of holding people hostage. Discouraging them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from engaging in such development simply requires making the return on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; investment too high for reasonable use.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A system in development that stops 20% in five years and 40% in 10 years 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 60% in 15 years doesn't deter attacks on population.  It may serve to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deter attacks on hardened military targets promising retaliation.  If we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build hardened military targets promising retaliation, any enemies we have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will notice that those tools can be used for offense as well as defense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd like to hear how developing a system like this promotes stability in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the period in which it's an imperfect shield.
