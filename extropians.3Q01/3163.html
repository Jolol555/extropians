<p>I was writing about how the reparations issue was distorted (which you took
<br>
out of context, above), and I was not thinking about you when I wrote
<br>
&quot;people&quot; up there, even though you defended the screed-essay of Fred Reed on
<br>
the grounds of &quot;... well, maybe there's something there...&quot; (not an exact
<br>
quote of yours, but what I remember as its essence).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; While I applaud that you have made journeys out of your comfort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; zone, it is arrogant for you to suppose that &quot;we&quot; [commie pinko
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; socialist statist leftists that we are] have not examined issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out of our &quot;comfort zone.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, can you find where you were described as a commie or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pinko on our recent discussion?  Have you made a straw man here?
</em><br>
<p>I never said you or anyone described me as a ... but there was a post in
<br>
jest a while back about commie pinko something, and I was using this for
<br>
effect, in jest.  No straw man, none needed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Second, I did not mean to imply that people from one side of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the political spectrum behave any different, statistically, than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those from any other part.  I said as much on several occasions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have simply noted that, far from only &quot;examining&quot; issues out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my comfort zone, I pulled the &quot;other way&quot; in the ideological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tug-of-war that has been going on.  No one else has.  No one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else probably will.  J. R. has come very close in his long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stream of consciousness post, and Joe may be headed in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction.  But that's it so far.  So no one from the side
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposite to mine has even tried, so far as I can tell.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe you guys had a way to go.  Maybe some of us didn't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; C'mon, libertarians don't have a monopoly on &quot;sweet reason.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Wow.  You really read my appeal from a jaundiced viewpoint;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but then, so did most people, I think.  There was never even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the *slightest* implication that there was a monopoly on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; letting reason into our lives:  it was clearly a description
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what may be possible for many people of every political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and philosophical position.  But I am not too hopeful that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are going to believe me, or go back and re-examine my post.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I believe you.  I just wanted to make certain we understand each
<br>
other.  Just let me have my own &quot;sweet reason,&quot; and remember - I'm not a
<br>
post-modernist devotee, so I don't take &quot;anything goes&quot; as an acceptable
<br>
answer to every issue.  (I'm not imputing the latter to you, don't get me
<br>
wrong, only pointing out I'm not of the woo woo variety of commie pinko
<br>
socialist statist leftists ... ha ha ha!  It's a joke, son).
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
