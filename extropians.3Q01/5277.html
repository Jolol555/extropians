<em>&gt; Granted, while sitting in the seat one still experiences gravity, so

</em><br>

<p>I imagine you are more than intelligent enough to know this is a
<br>
silly game having nothing to do with the intent of the
<br>
question.  The intent was to point out that the rules of
<br>
physics, the nature of reality, does not change just because our
<br>
understanding of and beliefs about it change.  That we attempt
<br>
different things depending on our beliefs about what is possible
<br>
is irrelevant to that intent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Why do you say the nonrealist position is subjective? That doesn't make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much sense. Realism is built solely on the premise of a priori or steady
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state truth statements. That means when one enters into analytical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning, a criterium is already established with respect to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result, that it be &quot;real&quot;. Seems to me realism is much more subjective
</em><br>
