Brent writes, quoting Hal
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The movie is not about people's inhumanity to robots, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about people's inhumanity to people.  It's not about a robot who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; learns to love, it's about love itself and the pain and joy it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bring.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	Oh wow!  I didn't realize this.  This is very profound.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think you are completely right and the movie does do this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fantastically.  Thanks for pointing this out.
</em><br>
<p>I don't mean to overstate this, because of course everyone reacts to a
<br>
movie differently and I don't want to say that some reactions are right
<br>
and others wrong.  Analyzing the movie in terms of what it tells us
<br>
about robot design is still an interesting exercise.  But to consider
<br>
what Spielberg and/or Kubrick were trying to accomplish, we have to
<br>
think more in terms of a mainstream audience.
<br>
<p>[Spoilers are present below]
<br>
<p>There's a subtext in the movie I haven't seen discussed, which is
<br>
the religious aspect.  I mentioned Joe's comment about church, about
<br>
searching for their makers.  In a way, David's odyssey can be seen as
<br>
a search for God.  He seeks the love of a human being, and humans are
<br>
his creators.  In the same way many people feel a deep desire to be
<br>
loved by their own image of their creator.
<br>
<p>It's always seemed to me that the belief in god, and more specifically
<br>
the *need* to believe in god, stems from early childhood, when one's
<br>
parents have god-like powers.  As we get older we find that this isn't
<br>
so and become disillusioned, but we never lose the craving to return to
<br>
that state of certainty.
<br>
<p>The movie plays with this theme: Monica as mother, as goddess; Dr. Hobby
<br>
as father, as creator, as god.  This suggests a reason (in terms of
<br>
the dramatic structure) why David never bonds with Monica's husband:
<br>
without realizing it he is searching all the time for his true father,
<br>
his creator.  And we learn eventually that David has been created in
<br>
the image of Dr. Hobby's lost son.
<br>
<p>In the end, David is brought back together with his mother, his goddess,
<br>
in a golden, glowing, perfect day.  It's not unlike many people's visions
<br>
of Heaven, to be reunited with loved ones, to be reunited with God.
<br>
Heavenly visions are traditionally depicted with in glowing colors,
<br>
suffused with light, just as the final sequence is shot.  And of course
<br>
the final part is an afterlife for David, who is revived after a &quot;death&quot;.
