</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Earth to send a &quot;friendly&quot; group of enforcement spacecraft over

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Why?  It's the same as trespassing.  Our colony would be our territory
<br>
(and quite possibly the space around it, either up to 3 miles citing
<br>
&quot;territorial waters&quot;, or up to whatever the airspace ceiling is at the
<br>
time).  If we were independent, and not signatory to any treaty stating
<br>
that no space property may be sovereign, then we would be fully within
<br>
our rights to treat any visitors as guests of our state who may be
<br>
expelled at our whim, much like diplomats.  (Spies disguised as
<br>
immigrants would be another issue, but presumably we would have a legal
<br>
regime that does not allow any few citizens to destroy the entire
<br>
colony or otherwise halt our research, whether those citizens be
<br>
foreign agents or merely the deluded crazies that such a colony would
<br>
inevitably attract.)  If they leave, only to turn around and attack
<br>
ship-to-colony, we could handle that like any other such attack.
<br>
<p>If they try to board...well, as advanced as even the US military is, we
<br>
could gain an advantage with some research into weapons and gear for
<br>
dedicated space infantry (i.e., troops trained to fight only in a space
<br>
station, not in jungles or cities or any environment inside a natural
<br>
gravity well).  Say, weapons designed to work in zero G.  Plus, they 
<br>
would be at a training disadvantage since the &quot;terrain&quot; would allow for
<br>
infantry only, not vehicles of any kind (at least inside the colony),
<br>
and in an environment they would likely never have fought a real battle
<br>
in (even if they set up their own base/colony specifically for space
<br>
war games).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I only see a colony being developed if things really go bad here on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earth, and the tech to go off-planet is cheap and reliable.  In a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass exodus we would have a chance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I love the nation of my birth and hope its leaders will steer away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the course they seem to be taking in regards to biotech.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonder what else they may lose nerve about down the road! :(  When I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go into space one day, I want to do so as a proud American citizen.
</em><br>
<p>I hear you, and share your hope.  But, just in case, I will try to
<br>
develop that cheap, reliable off-planet access tech, and support others
<br>
who are doing likewise.  (Besides, such would be far from the only use
<br>
of said tech.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This post brings back very fond memories of my time at the Extro! :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was privy to some great conversations there.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks.  ^_^  I've been trying to steer most of what threads I post to
<br>
in that direction.
