</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;made sure that my data shadow does not look like me:

<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<em>&gt;   o  avoid giving out address information (and no forwarding addresses)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   o  avoid ID cards where possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   o  avoid buying anything with a identifiable card (cash works nicely)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   o  avoid having an account with any business (or have one with a fake 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;name)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   o  avoid using bank accounts (safes work nicely)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   o  avoid using a personal number (fake one for each use)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   o  no mortgages, no loans, minimum number of contracts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   o  no known home address (every year the gov't threatens to define me 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dead)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   o  use several cash (mobile) phones and beepers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   o  suppress information about birthday and age (or just fake it)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   o  encrypt your data storage and conduits
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   o  use contra-surveillance techniques
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   o  avoid having any known habits, distinguishing features or marks

<em>&gt;   o  change your appearance aperiodically

<p>Holy mackarel!  That seems like an *awful* lot of trouble to go to just for 
<br>
a mere semblance of privacy.  How in the heck does all that subterfuge 
<br>
benefit you?  I am in derelict violation of each of those rules.  I have a 
<br>
fist full of credit cards (all same name and address - except for separate 
<br>
personal and business cards); I use my ATM card for nearly *everything* 
<br>
(groceries, movie tickets, airline ticktes, etc.)  I don't lie about my 
<br>
name, age, address, DOB, SSN, etc.  And (horror of horrors) I try to use the 
<br>
same userid and password for every online registration I get (ISP, Hotmail, 
<br>
Yahoo, online banking, Datek.com, paypal, etc., etc.)
<br>
<p>Granted if, say, Whole Foods Market got together with Blockbuster they could 
<br>
do one heck of a profile on me.  They'd be able to tell you every video I 
<br>
rented and every meal I've cooked for the past 5 years.  And if Bank of 
<br>
America joined in (who has the data on my Visa/ATM card) fuhgeddaboutit!  
<br>
You could figure out how often and where I travel, where I buy my clothes, 
<br>
toys and other necessities, what online services I patronize.  And ohmigosh! 
<br>
if American Express joined in, you'd know how often I eat out, and what my 
<br>
favorite restaurants are.
<br>
<p>Yeah, boy if the new world order ever decides to put together a profile on 
<br>
me it won't be hard at all.  Thing I can't figure out is (1) why on earth 
<br>
anyone would be interested in compiling such a dossier on me and (2) even if 
<br>
someone did, why should I care?
<br>
<p>BTW, if anyone cares to know, I frequent vegetarian restaurants (my favorite 
<br>
is Simply Wholesome), favor sci-fi and action-adventure flicks.  I get my 
<br>
tennis shoes (usually Adidas) from Footlocker, my play clothes from Western 
<br>
Surplus, my grown-up shoes from Nordstrom and my suits from Mens Wearhouse.  
<br>
I tend to spend way too much at Helen's Bike Shop and buy stuff from 
<br>
Dell.com far too frequently.  About once a month I'll buy a book (usually 
<br>
pop science) from Bookstar.  Now armed with all that scary knowledge you 
<br>
can...what?
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
