<br>
<p>Yes, thank you for reminding me. What the Japanese military/government did in
<br>
WWII makes Tuskegee and other American atrocities pale in comparison. And as
<br>
for the fanaticism of Americans, note that it centers mostly on issues which,
<br>
if taken to the extremes advocated by their proponents, would result in
<br>
nothing more pernicious than better health. The checks and balances that some
<br>
people complain gridlock the US system of governance also help to prevent
<br>
over-reacting to issues.
