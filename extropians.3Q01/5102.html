<em>&gt; Today I' m going to bring up a fellow from Ancient Greece that should
</em><br>
be
<br>
discussed more: Aristotle.
<br>
<p>I applaude you for the suggestion we should be returning to the &quot;basics&quot;
<br>
to
<br>
provide a foundation for the future. The world of past great thinkers
<br>
are
<br>
wholely different than the one we inhabit and could constrain our views
<br>
of
<br>
the future. However, we should take from them what is useful and
<br>
applicable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Modern philosophy is quite often about problematizing the values and
</em><br>
the
<br>
concepts that are the foundation of the aristotelian thinking. Yep, I
<br>
can
<br>
read Wittgenstein, but the aristotelian view gives an important question
<br>
that I think is quite relevant to transhumanism.
<br>
<p>Modern philosophers have been occupied with different types of problems
<br>
those of reality and the ramifications of modern society. Plato,
<br>
Aristotle,
<br>
Socartes were more focused on the problem of man's place in the universe
<br>
and
<br>
society. In part this was due to the status of philosophy from 1600
<br>
onward
<br>
as science reduced philosophy's traditional territory. Ethics in a
<br>
secular
<br>
society was left to religion, then when metaphysics was not considered
<br>
legitimate philosophy was left without bearings.  Instead of being the
<br>
intellectual guiding light of past years, the best it could get was a
<br>
supporting role for other fields.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The question is- what does it mean to &quot;live a good life&quot;, and how
</em><br>
should I
<br>
act if I wish to achieve it. The question emphazises the possiblities of
<br>
philosophy to act as a guide to life.  The objective knowledge, not
<br>
confusion.
<br>
<p>I believe philosophy will again achieve prominance as the world being
<br>
reformed in the crucible of the future seeks a new vision, a new sense
<br>
of
<br>
meaning and place in the great scheme of things of which technology
<br>
plays a
<br>
fundemental. Just as special effects don't make good movies, technology
<br>
and
<br>
science in themselves can not provide answers to the big questions. When
<br>
scientists and technologists do they are being philosophers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As you can see, there are som differences between a platonic and
</em><br>
aristotelian view. And thus it is important to see that an enmeshing of
<br>
Plato into the transhumanist tradition will only damage it. These are
<br>
very
<br>
important things. Someone might ask &quot;excuse me, isn't the concepts of
<br>
eudaimonia etc, already present in a way in transhumanism already?&quot;. I
<br>
would
<br>
say: yes indeed there are parallells, since transhumanism has its roots
<br>
back
<br>
to aristotelianism, especially since aristotelianism focuses on this
<br>
physical world instead of a &quot;land of ideas&quot;...............The main
<br>
lesson
<br>
which the ideologically conscious transhumanist must learn form the
<br>
successes of the 19th century liberals, and the 20th century socialists
<br>
is
<br>
that it was their courage to be visionary which gained them the support
<br>
of
<br>
the intellectuals and therefore an influence on public opinion which is
<br>
daily making possible what only recently seemed utterly remote.
<br>
<p>I interprete these two statements as somewhat contradictory. One one
<br>
hand
<br>
stating that Platonism would ruin transhumanism while lauding the
<br>
ideological world visions of the liberals and socialists. The latter
<br>
sounds
<br>
pretty Platonist to me. This does not necessarily present a problem as
<br>
the
<br>
reason Plato stands shoulder to shoulder with Aristotle is because
<br>
neither
<br>
of them had all the answers. For the western intellectual tradition,
<br>
attention to one or the other waxes or wanes with the temperment and
<br>
tone of
<br>
the times, but they none the less come as a pair not to be separated. I
<br>
also
<br>
believe we should also introduce the philosophers of all the world into
<br>
the
<br>
discussion because Aristotle, Plato or Socarates for that matter account
<br>
for
<br>
only a part of the globe's intellectural history and Buddha, Lao Tsu,
<br>
and
<br>
many others are of equal importance and therefore have a great deal to
<br>
offer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unless we can make the philosophic foundations of a transhumanist
</em><br>
society
<br>
once more a living intellectual issue, and its implementation a task
<br>
which
<br>
challenges the ingenuity and imagination of our liveliest minds, the
<br>
prospects of dynamism are indeed dark............ &quot;Politics is all about
<br>
fighting.
<br>
<p>I would agree with this since the changes we will be making will become
<br>
more
<br>
permanent (ie.germ line therapy) we do need to have a better idea of
<br>
what we
<br>
want before we have to accept what we have. A good start is to develop a
<br>
less competitive approach to politics since we are all in this together
<br>
and
<br>
everyone has something of value to bring to the table.
