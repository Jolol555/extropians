<p><em>&gt; I'm so sorry they aren't paying MD-PHds more than poor working people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wages these days.
</em><br>
<p>It really would be best for all concerned to avoid personal references
<br>
like this.  Surely, with practice, we can all learn to make our points
<br>
without venturing dangerously close to the ad hominem.  Also, I know
<br>
that the temptation to sarcasm is strong---especially when one feels
<br>
outnumbered.  But in that case, there is all the more reason to confine
<br>
oneself to careful argument.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then there are people who work but don't need to - like Bill Gates (but there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zounds of them, at less-extreme examples).   Does Bill work harder than child-care
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workers ... or his own maids?  Why this obscene disparity in wages?
</em><br>
<p>In a society of millions, or hundreds of millions, some people's economic worth
<br>
to others (sometimes as in the case of movie stars or baseball players, millions
<br>
of others) will be vastly, vastly more than other's economic worth.  Should 
<br>
school teachers be paid more than movie stars?  Who is to say?  The answer is
<br>
not some committee that will force their decision on others, but people freely
<br>
choosing with their dollar-votes.  Yes, sometimes the differences are obscene.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is all personal, I realize - but I feel lucky to be healthy, relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent, productive and, most important, to have the capacity to enjoy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life.  So what if some of my hard-earned money goes to lazy people, or blind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, or schizophrenic people?
</em><br>
<p>That should be your choice.  Not all people think or feel as you do.  Why
<br>
should they be literally forced to yield up their money?  This question,
<br>
often posed in the libertarian slogan &quot;never initiate the use of force&quot;
<br>
has been repeatedly mentioned on this forum.  Of all the people here who
<br>
favor government action, only the person you were responding to above,
<br>
namely Rafal Smigrodzki, MD-Phd, has by coincidence said anything at all
<br>
about this maxim.
<br>
