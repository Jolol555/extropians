<em>&gt; SDI is the only moral option for a libertarian society based on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premise of not initiating violence.
</em><br>
<p>It might be the only moral option if it were plausibly shown to be 
<br>
workable.  At this point it is still mostly a massive costly boondoggle in 
<br>
the making.  The research done by Dave Redell of CPSR on the 
<br>
(in)feasibility of building software that would achieve the necessary 
<br>
claims of the SDI project are still the best reference on this subject.  
<br>
Not being able to shoot a single missle out of the air in a fair trial is 
<br>
one problem, but they also have to get their software to work correctly 
<br>
every time in the first battle, without any reasonable arena for evolving 
<br>
it into robustness beforehand.
<br>
<p>To the extent that government spending on defense is defensible, I wouldn't 
<br>
mind them continuing to spend money on research, but to talk about 
<br>
deployment is outrageous.
