<p><em>&gt;You can understand Americans saying &quot;bomb their countries to dust&quot;, but not

<p>Damien, please talk to Jerry about it. I don't know where to begin answering
<br>
your comment which I'll blame on my inability to project a sufficiently
<br>
nuanced model of myself onto the list (a problem a few people seem to be
<br>
experiencing having lately, it seems). Nor do I yet have a good mental model
<br>
of where *you're* coming from.
<br>
<p>I'm out of here for the next two months. Best wishes to all.
<br>
<p>Russell
