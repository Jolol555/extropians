<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;&gt; Consider the confused but dangerous yammering of the &quot;anti-globalists.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Where do they stand?  Their program of cultural balkanaziation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; provides the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perfect breeding ground for bin Laden's vermin.  They are without doubt an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unwitting fifth column for his brand of international &quot;cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrorists,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because in the deeply divided world they seek to create, Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fundamentalism will thrive as a powerful and motivated universalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ideology. Bush defined at least the beginnings of an internationalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mentality that can be premised on values strong enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; withstand both the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; calls of the critics to step back from progress and the jihad of the armed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mullahs.  Again, if Bush has begun the process of recasting the West's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; identity in terms of vigorous self-confidence, then we have indeed seen a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;pivotal moment in history&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the most important thing.  I am proud of the way Bush handled this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His speech and planning is the best I have seen from a U.S. president in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However...  My fear is that his support is based on the immediate emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction to recent events.  There are many fundamentalist factions within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our own country and around the world that don't want to be part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global community.  There are religious leaders in this country that do not
</em><br>
<p>I don't want to be part of &quot;the global community&quot;.  We have a precious difficult
<br>
enough time preserving human freedom and having a more or less open and just
<br>
society within our own borders.  Arguably, most of us don't understand or have
<br>
a grasp on the bedrock of what makes for a free society.  In the world at
<br>
large that grasp is much, much more tenuous.  If you try to just make a global
<br>
state for the sake of a global state it will, I greatly and I believe rightly
<br>
fear, thin out truly free society and the philosophical underpinnings of the
<br>
same fatally.  I do not plan to live under laws proposed by &quot;the world&quot; but
<br>
only under those laws of a government I voluntarily support and am a citizen
<br>
of and only so long as and to the degree that it upholds freedom.  It has nothing 
<br>
to do with religion for me.  It has to do with freedom and
<br>
preserving and extending it.  I do not see that a world government will do
<br>
this and I see much signs that it will create a larger and more bloated tyranny 
<br>
that is much more inescapable and thorough than any other in history.
<br>
<p>That some countries take self-determination and do disasterous things with it
<br>
is no more argument against such self-determination of a state separate from
<br>
others than the fact that some people do disasterous things with their freedom
<br>
is an argument against freedom. 
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; want to protect what they consider to be false religions.  There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isolationists who do not want to mingle or cooperate with other people.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fear that much of the fervor is being driven not just by patriots and those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fighting for good, but also by those who want to use this as an excuse to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become more isolationist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I do not want to mingle with any people or group that do not understand
<br>
the crucial and absolutely essential place of freedom and do not uphold it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As the years pass, and our targets become more and more diverse, I expect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see support waning.  After the WTC and Pentagon attackers are dealt with,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how many people want to risk American lives to stop terrorism in the Middle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; East?  How many people want the U.S. to be part of a global task force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of a single military leader?  How many people want to increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international cooperation, commerce, immigration and trade?  There is a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of support now due to selfish U.S. interests.  I commend Bush for taking the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger and more long-term view of this crisis.  However when the immediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat is gone, and it comes time to risk American lives to protect foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultures from foreign terrorism, I am not sure how strong the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolve will be maintained.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>A global armed force under what kinds of governing principles?  Respecting
<br>
what matter of human rights?  Rights protected by what body of law and
<br>
based on what philosophy?  I do not need a global state, the ultimate large
<br>
gang, in order to decide what is right and act on it.  
<br>
<p>Of course we want more international cooperation and trade but not at the
<br>
cost of losing what makes this country great and different than most others.
<br>
<p>We have already fought quite a bit to help foreign peoples.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Although this crisis has united Americans and all civilized countries in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short term, I am predicting that we will see more desperate retaliation from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racists, isolationists, nationalist, religionists, and luddites from within
</em><br>
<p>I do not appreciate that you so easily disparage all people and attempt
<br>
to lump them together in one indistinquishable vile heap.  It is a cheap
<br>
trick of rhetoric.  The real world is much more complex.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; our own ranks.  The attack of religionists against gays, liberals and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ACL has already occurred.  
</em><br>
<p>A few religious people said some stupid and predictable things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The battle over privacy and encryption has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already begun.  
</em><br>
<p>It was already begun.  Again, a few in that camp took advantage of the 
<br>
situation.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Battles over due process, search and seizure, and homeland
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security restrictions will be next.  
</em><br>
<p>Due to MATA, they already are.
