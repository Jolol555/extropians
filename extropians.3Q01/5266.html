<p><em>&gt; What is gravity? It's a theoretical construct which is known to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorrect, since its descriptions in quantum physics and relativity can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reconciled. How can an incorrect theoretical construct be an inherent part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of reality?
</em><br>
<p>I really think that the categories &quot;correct&quot; and &quot;incorrect&quot; don't
<br>
serve us well here.  In science, the degree to which something is
<br>
correct relates very strongly to the degree to which it can be used
<br>
to make successful predictions.  So you will see in a majority of
<br>
books that discuss the topics, that relativity theory is taken as
<br>
a correction to Newtonian theory.  Newtonian celestial mechanics
<br>
is used exclusively in many kinds of trajectory calculations to 
<br>
this day.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, even if we tried to cling to your rigid notion
<br>
of &quot;correctness&quot;, then we'd be in no position, really, to announce
<br>
that QM or GR is correct; in fact, (as you say), we know that they
<br>
don't cover each other's realms.
<br>
<p>Approximate assertions, e.g., &quot;the planets orbit the sun in ellipses&quot;
<br>
should be taken as (a) true, and (b) a correct description of reality.
<br>
Even calling such assertions &quot;approximate&quot; is misleading, because it
<br>
carries the implication that there are assertions that are &quot;certain&quot;,
<br>
which is also nonsense.  (FYI, there are only a very few unchallengable
<br>
assumptions, e.g., &quot;Some people have been to Hawaii&quot;, which I proudly
<br>
call The Great Hawaiian Truth  :-)
<br>
<p>Eternal Truth #2:  Every statement must be further modified.
