</em><br>

this depends on which state you are from.  in Queensland, the high school you
<br>
attend has a huge influence on wether you get to attend uni or not since your
<br>
final score is based on a combination of how you did compared to the rest of your
<br>
class and how that class did compared with the rest of the classes in the
<br>
state.  there is no individual competition among every member in the state, so
<br>
even if you top your class by a megaparsec, if your class average at a
<br>
standardised skills test is low compared to other classes, you are going to end
<br>
up with a mediocre score.  This is all relatively new since it started in 1992.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for paying off your education, it is apercentage of your salary, you pay it if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earn more thana  certain threshold, and you pay back the debt, not a flat rate on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salary for life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
i don't think he was implying you had to pay for life.
<br>
<p>[later, you say]
<br>
<em>&gt; But I do think someone was pulling your leg.
</em><br>
<p>i don't see how what you wrote contradicts what he got told in any way.
