Hi ppl
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First. Forgive me for hijacking this thread, but it seemed like 
<br>
the most relevant to my query.
<br>
<p>Discussion of technological intervention around longevity and aging issues 
<br>
are quit popular on this list. But what i've been wondering about ( amongst 
<br>
other things ) is until we do have AI's with equivalent IQ's rated in 
<br>
powers, helping us develop nanotech to keep us fit and healthy for hundreds 
<br>
of years.
<br>
<p>How many of us brave technology advocates, are actually doing the next best 
<br>
thing until the technological magic bullets come online. How many of you 
<br>
ppl eat plenty of anti-oxidants, fresh fruit and veg, stay away from foods 
<br>
with high sodium, and saturated fat content. Exercise regularly, to keep 
<br>
body fat down, and the cardio-vascular system strong, etc.
<br>
<p>Because lets face it ppl, if we can't keep the old meat sacks we're stuck 
<br>
in, ticking over until we see some major developments, it's going to be our 
<br>
kids or grand kids who really benefit from longevity developments.
<br>
<p>Please lets not have anyone misunderstanding me, am a total advocate of 
<br>
technologically enhanced
<br>
life spans, and this post is in NO WAY an attack on Doug or his interesting 
<br>
research. Just interested in how many ppl on the list do more on a personal 
<br>
level, than hope technology can take up the strain in the future.
<br>
So many academics a know personally, seem to take the view that anyone 
<br>
involved an active exercise program, is probably stupid in direct 
<br>
proportion to there physical fitness.
<br>
<p>Guess i should say. At 36 years old i do all the above, i just about have 
<br>
the time and energy. Being sportingly active helps a lot, with the exercise 
<br>
regime. I also seem to be one of those ppl who has accidently self 
<br>
experimented with low calorie intake, ppl tell me i look 22-25 so i guess 
<br>
something must be working alongside my genetics.
<br>
<p>Thanks for your time
<br>
Zeb
