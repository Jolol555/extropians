<p>It seems of course more reasonable to phrase factual claims in terms of
<br>
learning things from your unconscious, rather than from nature. But it
<br>
worries me when you talk about truth being less important, about requiring
<br>
deep trust, and concluding that your personal path is beneficial to the
<br>
world.  I fear that your unconscious may be telling you comforting lies.
<br>
<p>You see, it seems that humans are not built to be truth-seekers, and so are
<br>
often happier, etc. when they allow other considerations to influence their
<br>
beliefs.  People like to think they are more able than they are, for example.
<br>
Humans are built to be truth-seekers more in some areas than in others,
<br>
but in all areas must rely enormously on unconscious mental processing.
<br>
In the areas where people seek truth more, they are conscious of critical
<br>
processes that check claims for various sorts of reasonableness.  In the
<br>
other areas, we tend to distract or disable these critical processes in
<br>
order to allow non-truth considerations to better influence beliefs.
<br>
This is the essence of self-deception.
<br>
<p>Believing that what is good for me is good for the world is exactly one
<br>
of those areas where we should expect people to be self-deceived.  If
<br>
the part of you that seems to claim this also seems to tell you that you
<br>
must trust it without doubt or criticism, and that truth isn't really
<br>
so important a goal, this seems a good candidate for self-deception.
<br>
I grant that you will probably be happier if you let yourself be
<br>
self-deceived in such a way.  But perhaps you would rather be less happy
<br>
and believe truer things.
