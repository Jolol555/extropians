<p>Wow... a genuine conspiracy.  So why didn't you take
<br>
legal action? Or did you?  If so, what were the

findings?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; b) lost out on financial aid in college, which

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; they were minorities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Did you get your education anyway... despite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; losing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out on financial aid?  Do you think it's possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some of those black students might not have gotten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their educations at all if they had lost out?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My parents had to pay full boat for my education,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which I did not and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could not afford to finish due to the expenses of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back injury. With
</em><br>
<em>&gt; three other siblings, they could only afford to send
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me for a year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless I obtained financial aid.
</em><br>
<p>That wasn't a yes or no.  Do you have a college degree
<br>
or not?
<br>
<p>I have 5 other siblings.  I also have an AA degree
<br>
which I paid for myself, no financial aid or help from
<br>
my parents and one of my brothers has an BS in EE,
<br>
also paid for by himself.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; c) am constantly accused of being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; racist/sexist/'rich elite' simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; because I am a white male.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't think it's simply because you are a white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; male... But more because you say things like &quot;am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; constantly accused of being a racist/sexist/'rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; elite' simply because I am a white male.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Like I said, I was a white male... and I never got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accused of being racist (or sexist, for that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you are constantly being accused of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; maybe you should take a look at your words and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actions.  It isn't just because you are a white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; male.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Irrespective of my words and actions, which anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective enough on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list would understand are not racist, sexist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I have certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never been part of the 'rich elite'.
</em><br>
<p>But accusations of racism and sexism are based on
<br>
words and actions (rich elite was thrown in by you...
<br>
red herring).  Even if you feel your words and actions
<br>
aren't racist or sexist, some people DO feel they
<br>
are... because as you say you are being constantly
<br>
accused.
<br>
<p>People seem to be objective enough to recognize that I
<br>
am neither racist or sexist, why do you think they
<br>
can't be objective when dealing with you?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, the only lack of opportunity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; blacks I've known have had has been produced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; their own memetic programming, and not by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the system. When you are programmed to expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; racism, that is exactly what you will get.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Racism is caused by the people being discriminated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; against, simply becuase they believe it exists?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You didn't really just say that, did you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, that is NOT what I said, so stop putting words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my mouth like you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; folks usually do.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;When you are programmed to expect racism, that is
<br>
exactly what you will get&quot;
<br>
<p>Seems pretty clear to me.  Expectations of racism, on
<br>
the part of the victims, is the cause of racism.
<br>
<p>In what way is my restatement wrong?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I have met my share of bigots.
</em><br>
<p>Me too.  
<br>
<p>I said this before, let me say it again... I DO NOT
<br>
think you would ever consciously commit a racist act.
<br>
<p>I DO think you make unintentionally racist remarks.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Mike... I have no trouble at all believing you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; good person who would never engage in overt acts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discrimination... but you have deluded yourself if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think that blacks bring it all on themselves...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is statements like that which result in you being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; called racist... it has nothing to do with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; color
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of your skin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I was in basic training, every black fellow who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dropped out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; training did so claiming 'racism', despite our three
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DI's being black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hispanic and female, respectively. Those fellows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who stuck with it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laughed at such insinuations as cop outs. 
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm... and yet I know many white males who worked
<br>
their way through school, receiving their education by
<br>
their own efforts rather than using grants or their
<br>
parents and didn't complain about AA being reverse
<br>
discrimination.  In fact they laugh at the idea.  It
<br>
strikes them as a cop out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen these sorts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations FAR more frequently than actual incidents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of discrimination.
</em><br>
<p>Different personal experiences, obviously.  I have
<br>
rarely seen a black person claim discrimination where
<br>
none existed... and I saw actual discrimination
<br>
against blacks in the work place and by police in my
<br>
neighborhood on the average of once a week.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A large amount of the poor opinion of blacks that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have seen in whites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that far too many blacks live down to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stereotypes that whites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have, and thereby hurt all.
</em><br>
<p>A lot of the poor opinion of whites that I have seen
<br>
in blacks is due to far too many whites engaging in
<br>
actual discrimination, some subtle, some not so
<br>
subtle.  Some intentional, some unintentional.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I do not say that discrimination against blacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't exist. I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fought against it myself, 
</em><br>
<p>Good.  Now maybe fight it IN yourself.
<br>
<p>Take another look at what you've been writing to me. 
<br>
Rather than trying to &quot;win&quot; this particular argument,
<br>
see if you can spot how anyone might so
<br>
&quot;misunderstand&quot; you as to think your statements are
<br>
racist.
<br>
<p>Anyway... I feel I've made my points.  I don't believe
<br>
there is much to be gained by continuing this thread. 
<br>
Last word is yours.
<br>
<p>Loree
