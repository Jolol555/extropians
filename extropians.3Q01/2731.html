<em>&gt; A. D. Wright Tells How to Get Into People's Homes and on their Couch
</em><br>
<p>Good one, Natasha. I've developed countermeasures to these over time.
<br>
<p>a) having a VERY friendly and noisy dog helps keep them outside. I just
<br>
open the door wide enough to stick my head out. The yapping dog keeps
<br>
them from wanting to venture further.
<br>
b) I say, 'Hey, brothers, have you guys been biking all over town in
<br>
those shirts and ties ALL DAY? You must be REALLY HOT and TIRED,&quot; all
<br>
while not making any effort to offer refreshments (it's okay if I sip my
<br>
own soda).
<br>
c) I ask them what they are here for. 
<br>
If they are mormons, I mention the fact that Joseph Smith was once laid
<br>
up over across the river in South Royalton with a broken leg once, he
<br>
broke it on one of his many drunken sprees, carousing around the town. I
<br>
mention that some families still keep account of the bills old Joe
<br>
skipped out on when he left town and ask if the Church ever paid those
<br>
up...
<br>
Since they are usually some kind of christians, I usually ask them to
<br>
resolve some theological paradoxes for me. I think next time I'll ask
<br>
them about the topological properties of hell and whether angels dancing
<br>
on pins can be considered quantum objects...
<br>
d) When they ask me about my own faith, I say I don't need any faith,
<br>
&quot;cause I KNOW-uh, the TRUTH-uh!&quot; and go off on Theilhard des Chardins
<br>
and Omega Point Theory and bring in the technologies of the
<br>
singularity... by this point in time, if they haven't already, they've
<br>
figured out I'm either completely nuts, posessed of the devil, or had
<br>
too much &quot;LDS in the 60's&quot;....
