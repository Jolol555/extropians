<em>&gt; (While my tongue was firmly planted in cheek, the above is not a joke.  Many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Christians&quot; believe it to be the gospel truth.  My question is does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion even need debunking?  Seems that theism is its own best debunker.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>For rational people religiosity is its own best debunker, yes. It's the
<br>
millions of irrational people with guns, bombs, and the desire to use them
<br>
that forces us to contend with them. Science needs to put on a better show
<br>
than religiosity does so that religionists won't be buying scientists to fight
<br>
their wars (as happened last century). Notice if you will that the media are
<br>
rather fickle in their support of science versus superstition. That's because
<br>
the media are preoccupied with making money, not with telling the truth. Duh!
<br>
And pandering to religionists and their irrational minions earns fortunes.
<br>
Incidentally, the movie &quot;AI&quot; is already becoming passe -- supplanted by &quot;Cats
<br>
And Dogs.&quot; Anyway, the media never wanted to promote science, they want to
<br>
promote pop-science.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
