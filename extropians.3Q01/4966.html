---&gt; Russell Blackford
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Speaking for myself, I read the list in the hope of obtaining clues and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making contacts in one of my personal projects, which consists of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neo-Luddite ideas, developing an intellectual defence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguing in public for the transhumanist cause. Most of what I read is just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noise from that viewpoint. However, it's pleasant chatting about all kinds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of things with a group of people who are broadly sympathetic to the above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aims. I don't expect them all to agree with my political views and I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get angry or impatient when I encounter disagreement. Indeed, there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people on this list with very different political views from mine whom I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now like to think of as friends. Eg, take a bow, Lee and Reason.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;bow&gt;
<br>
<p>I'd consider Russell's politics the politics I'd like to have in a world
<br>
where we all got along. I'm going to be imprecise and say they they just
<br>
feel so much more humanist and caring than my views.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I *am* getting impatient with the use of the word &quot;liberal&quot; (in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of social democrat/ic) as one of abuse. The way this is done, day in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day out, suggests that some people here believe that liberal ideas in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense are somehow contrary to extropianism or to transhumanism or to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list's traditions and are illegitimate on this list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *Is* that the feeling? Are any of you prepared to come right out and say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that people with Olga's political views, or Miriam's, or Damien's, or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mine, are just not welcome here? Should we simply form our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanist list and avoid a lot of grief?
</em><br>
<p>Well I'll come out and say what I rarely get around to saying these days. An
<br>
old and battered soapbox of mine:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) All viewpoints, memes and political philosophies are essential to a
<br>
healthy and viable society. This includes viewpoints, memes and political
<br>
viewpoints that you are forced to defend yourself against.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Monocultures -- a lack of variety in any measurable societal
<br>
dimension -- are vulnerable to physical extinction from any number of
<br>
factors.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Monocultures will become increasingly more vulnerable as the power
<br>
available to small groups of people increases, e.g. as we transition into a
<br>
nanotech future.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) We cannot predict with accuracy which monocultures or will lead to
<br>
extinction.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Therefore, all viewpoints, memes and political philosophies are
<br>
essential to a healthy and viable society.
<br>
<p>So I just grit my teeth in the face of homophobes, modern professional
<br>
politicians, authors of illogical religious tracts, etc, etc.
<br>
<p>Given that extropians want to survive in an ever-expanding future, and that
<br>
any one person in that future can kill a monoculture, extropians should
<br>
embrace -- or at least put up with -- all philosophies. We are not in a
<br>
position to predict the future with any accuracy insofar as it impacts us;
<br>
we think that radical changes are coming down the pike. That implies that we
<br>
should be prepared.
