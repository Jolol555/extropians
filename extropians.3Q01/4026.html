From: &quot;Damien Broderick&quot;
<br>
my point remains: `superbugs' aren't an especially virulent
<br>
novelty, just a reversion to how things were *before* we had the
<br>
`low-hanging fruit' off the metaphoric antibiotic tree, and wasted it
<br>
improvidently. Is that correct?
<br>
==============================================
<br>
Well, best to harvest the fruit that comes off easily in the hand and allow
<br>
the rest to ripen, no?
<br>
==============================================
<br>
For a more staid overview of the situation, three googURLs:
<br>
<p>Basic Background:
<br>
<a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/antimicro.htm">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/antimicro.htm</a>
<br>
In addition to its adverse effect on public health, antimicrobial resistance
<br>
contributes to higher health care costs. Treating resistant infections often
<br>
requires the use of more expensive or more toxic drugs and can result in
<br>
longer hospital stays for infected patients. The Institute of Medicine, a
<br>
part of the National Academy of Sciences, has estimated that the annual cost
<br>
of treating antibiotic resistant infections in the United States may be as
<br>
high as $30 billion.
<br>
<p>A key factor in the development of antimicrobial resistance is the ability
<br>
of infectious organisms to adapt quickly to new environmental conditions.
<br>
Microbes generally are unicellular creatures that, compared with
<br>
multicellular organisms, have a small number of genes. Even a single random
<br>
gene mutation can have a large impact on their disease-causing properties;
<br>
and since most microbes replicate very rapidly, they can evolve rapidly.
<br>
Thus, a mutation that helps a microbe survive in the presence of an
<br>
antibiotic drug will quickly become predominant throughout the microbial
<br>
population. Microbes also commonly acquire genes, including those encoding
<br>
for resistance, by direct transfer from members of their own species or from
<br>
unrelated microbes
<br>
================================================

<br>
ANTIMICROBIAL EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM
<br>
Improving antimicrobial utilization is not only important from a
<br>
cost-containment perspective, but from a patient-care perspective as well.
<br>
Increasing appropriate antimicrobial usage can help avoid the potential for
<br>
adverse reactions and excessive selection of resistant organisms.
<br>
<p>A perceived need to implement ongoing monitoring of antimicrobial use and
<br>
physician prescribing habits has led to the development of an Antimicrobial
<br>
Education Program at WVUH. Again, the objective of the program is to
<br>
maximize patient outcomes with respect to antimicrobial therapy while
<br>
minimizing costs to the institution. This program was developed by the
<br>
Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and approved by the Patient Care Review
<br>
Committee.
<br>
<p>The thrust of the program is to divide antimicrobials into two categories:
<br>
<p>1. Open Use - antimicrobials that may be utilized upon the discretion of the
<br>
prescribing physician.
<br>
2. Criteria-Based - antimicrobials that must be utilized according to
<br>
approved criteria.
<br>
<p>Education and intervention will be conducted by the pharmacist on a
<br>
per-patient basis. To obtain an institutional perspective on antimicrobial
<br>
usage, one antimicrobial from the criteria-based category every quarter will
<br>
be selected to assess compliance through the Drug Utilization evaluation
<br>
(DUE) process.
<br>
<p>Specific antimicrobials that pose documented risks to patients, in terms of
<br>
toxicity and emerging resistance, will also be considered criteria-based
<br>
antimicrobials. If utilization outside of the criteria is inappropriate, the
<br>
pharmacist will intervene. If usage of this agent continues despite pharmacy
<br>
intervention, the Infectious Disease attending physician will review the
<br>
case. Note: This will not generate a formal ID consult. The goal, at this
<br>
point, is to provide peer-peer recommendations.
<br>
<p>It is, of course, acknowledged that antimicrobial usage outside of approved
<br>
criteria may be appropriate for a given patient. Both pharmacists and ID
<br>
physicians will be open to such cases.
<br>

Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci: Approach to Treatment and Control
<br>
Conclusions
<br>
Treatment options for VRE are limited to various combinations of
<br>
antimicrobials, none of which has been found to be absolutely effective. A
<br>
review of 69 cases of VRE found that 42 different combinations of
<br>
antibiotics had been used,[16] which illustrates both the extent and the
<br>
limitations of the treatment options now available. Since successful
<br>
treatment for VRE and multidrug-resistant enterococcal infections are yet to
<br>
be defined, current therapies are guided by microbiology laboratory reports.
<br>
Caution is needed by pharmacists and physicians when reviewing studies of
<br>
treatment of VRE. The usefulness of any regimen in a particular institution
<br>
is affected by local factors such as the presence of other resistances
<br>
besides vancomycin resistance, levels of resistance, phenotypes, and species
<br>
being studied.
<br>
<p>Studies documenting patient outcomes are needed as new therapies are
<br>
developed. Since the organism is so adaptable, the answer to controlling
<br>
these difficult and resistant infections may lie not in the development of
<br>
new antibiotics, but rather in research that focuses on methods to overcome
<br>
the resistance. A national group is currently addressing these problems.[21]
<br>
At present, the most effective control measures are the prevention of the
<br>
spread and development of infection
<br>
================================================
<br>
The second reference has an excellent graphic (at the end of the article)
<br>
that illustrates the interrelationship between pharmacokinetics,
<br>
pharmacodynamics, and pharmacoeconomics. Hospitals in the US are under
<br>
increasing pressure to meet economic performance goals. Profitability
<br>
delimits research and treatment availability and utilization. Note the
<br>
dramatic decline in the production of many vaccines that cannot match demand
<br>
in today's market. But I am getting sidetracked here.
<br>
Take a look at Kaminuma's work at the NIHS in Japan: the right dosage of the
<br>
right drug for the right client at the right time.
<br>
<a href="http://cbi.or.jp/cbi/CBIj/vol1/1-1to17kaminuma.pdf">http://cbi.or.jp/cbi/CBIj/vol1/1-1to17kaminuma.pdf</a>
<br>
His goal is currently unattainable. Too much data being churned into
<br>
information without sufficient computational soft/hard power at this
<br>
point-in-time to complete the perquisite individualized knowledge base.
<br>
<p>But The Spike Cometh. Let's hope it beats out rampant necrotizing fasciitis,
<br>
the leprosy of the privileged man.
<br>
Here, I picked another apple for you...
