<p>Uh, that would be fairly dangerous to your sex life as it takes
<br>
a while for a guy to recover normal potency after such.  No,
<br>
estrogen wouldn't tell you what PMS is like.  Although varying
<br>
the 'mones properly would give you part of it without the
<br>
physical discomforts. Would colors be more vibrant.  Commonly,
<br>
for many, somewhat.  I know too many channel surfing guitar mad
<br>
women to think the last two will happen. :)

<em>&gt; I dont care if I get sterile, especially if it is reversible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously I would not want to lose the old sex drive tho.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My notion is that I would be a better companion for

<p>Some are impotent pretty quickly from estrogen.  Some recover
<br>
fully quickly. Some not so quick.  Some not completely.  Some
<br>
not at all.  It depends on dose and duration and the pwerson.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Observation:  for some reason which I have never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understood, women seem to grok men's feelings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better than men grok women's feelings.  Loree, someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who has been both may have a unique insight on this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyone else is welcome to comment on this observation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does it ring true to you?  I figure if I gave myself a dose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of estrogen, I could be as empathetic as she is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Once I transitioned a decade ago, actually when I had been
<br>
taking estrogen a few months,  I certainly noticed my heart
<br>
opening and that I understood more fully a much wider range of
<br>
emotions and states of being of people around me.  I had always
<br>
been somewhere in-between the stereotypes even before transition
<br>
but that all opened much more fully on hormones.  
<br>
<p>I would really not recommend a dose of estrogen for this for the
<br>
limited purposes you are pursuing.  It is not a really quick
<br>
thing and there are potential side-effects you don't want.  To
<br>
really know would require stepping into that state of being for
<br>
a while imho.
