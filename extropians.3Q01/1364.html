<em>&gt; &gt; Exactly why was that a huge commercial success for Astra, if they could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have gone on selling palliatives for ulcers instead?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now the market for ulcer treatments is much smaller.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know of any ulcer cures marketed here in Oz. It has been known for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe a decade, maybe two, that the pylori(sp?) bacteria are the cause of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stomach ulcers,
</em><br>
<p>The problem is the bacteria only causes some ulcers.  A lot of physicians
<br>
and patients jump to the conclusion that they causes all ulcers and that
<br>
treating for them will cure all ulcers with few exceptions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I haven't seen anything other than quackery about them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at chemists (acid-neutralising alkalis, clay drinks, etc.) and quack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; palliatives are advertised heavily on TV and in the print media.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However I am not a doctor or a chemist (I'm a lowly artist) so I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really say cure are not available. I will be stepping out today to go to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer club, so will drop in on a chemist and ask about this.
</em><br>
<p>Generally, though not always, ulcers have a dietary or other lifestyle
<br>
cause.  Most people, however, would rather pop pills than make big lifestyle
<br>
changes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;You are likely thinking of why so little is spent on malaria vaccines and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cures for other tropical diseases. That is a real problem, but the issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;isn't that cures are unprofitable (they aren't) but that it is hard to
</em><br>
make
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;any profit commensurable with the investment in the current regulatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;climate. The base costs of pharmaceutical development are high, and if
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;try to get FDA approval or something like it they will be even greater.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;That will make the potential market in the developing countries small,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;given the latest anti-patent moves on pharmaceuticals you might end up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;funding competitors instead. If you just sell something less well tested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cheaply or do the tests in the developing nations you will be crucified
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the media as a ruthless profiteer exploiting the poor. It is a lose-lose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;situation which any sensible corporation will try to stay out from,
</em><br>
leaving
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it to far less well funded organisations. Too bad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. This is part of my point. Capitalism fails here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not really the fault of regulations either. The regulations are
</em><br>
there
<br>
<em>&gt; for a very good reason: to try to eliminate unethical business practices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and honest mistakes (think thalidomide).
</em><br>
<p>It's funny that thalidomide should be brought up, since the FDA first
<br>
approved it.:)  Also, the FDA has kept life saving drugs off the market as
<br>
well as approving of life threatening ones.  See &quot;An Inside Look at the FDA'
<br>
s Sordid Drug Approval Process&quot; at
<br>
<a href="http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2001/june2001_report_fda.html">http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2001/june2001_report_fda.html</a>
<br>
<p>This is merely one example -- the FDA's approval of Rezulin.  FDA approved
<br>
drugs kill tens of  thousands of people in the US every year.  (See
<br>
<a href="http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag95/july95_offshore.html">http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag95/july95_offshore.html</a>)
<br>
<p>The FDA also does not freedom of speech.  See &quot;FDA Regulation:At Odds --
<br>
Again -- with Your Health Freedom&quot; at
<br>
<a href="http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag98/sep98_hepc2.html">http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag98/sep98_hepc2.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And those costs would come about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one way or another eventually, perhaps by total distrust of all medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies and associated loss of sales, or by insurance costs after
</em><br>
mopping
<br>
<em>&gt; up disasters, or by general damage to the drug-buying public.
</em><br>
<p>The FDA creates an aura of credibility which lulls the drug using public
<br>
into a false sense of security.  Instead of being informed consumers, most
<br>
people become trusting consumers -- because they think, like you, the FDA
<br>
does good work and has their best interests in mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What it comes down to is that the phamaceutical companies are motivated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money. That is neither a good nor a bad thing. But it does mean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity can't depend upon capitalism alone.
</em><br>
<p>And FDA regulators are motivated by?  Money!  Status!  Power!  This is not
<br>
to be totally cynical.  I don't think that every last person at the FDA is
<br>
corrupt, but the system itself definitely allows and even encourages
<br>
corruption.  A lot of FDA regulators retire to become...  high paid
<br>
consultants for big pharmacueticals.  (The same sort of thing happens
<br>
between the military and arms merchants.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is where non-profit organisations shine. They help humanity where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money won't lure capitalism.
</em><br>
<p>At least one big drug company -- Burroughs Wellcome -- is a nonprofit.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
