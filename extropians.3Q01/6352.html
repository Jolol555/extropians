<em>&gt; US policy not only creates enimies, it funds them via the War on

</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/now/story/0,1597,201444-412,00.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/now/story/0,1597,201444-412,00.shtml</a> or

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The Swedes and the Swiss seem to have a very low incident of terrorism for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that very reason.  Note all the First World nations that do have high rates:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the US, Britain, France, and Italy.  Don't you see the connection?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You forgot Spain and Israel, high rates both.  I see the connection,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except for France and Italy, which I didn't realize had high rates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of terrorism.
</em><br>
<p>Yet Switzerland, as a major banking center of the world, is at least as
<br>
responsible for the types of 'repression' that these third world
<br>
a##holes yap about, but you don't see anything going on there, do you?
<br>
<p>The countries that are targeted for terrorism are those who have been
<br>
most active in combatting it and spreading ideas of liberty, freedom,
<br>
and individual rights, which are anathema to the sort of control freaks
<br>
with anti-liberty mindsets.
<br>
<p>Anyone who thinks the Taliban are to be considered agents of freedom are
<br>
seriously deranged.
