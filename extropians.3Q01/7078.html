<p>
Throw this into the mix. Chomsky, as always, worth a look,
<br>
no matter what one makes of his conclusions...
<br>
<p>MMB
<br>
<p>Interviewing Chomsky
<br>
<p>Radio B92, Belgrade
<br>
<p><p>Q: Why do you think these attacks happened?
<br>
<p>To answer the question we must first identify the perpetrators of the 
<br>
crimes. It is generally assumed, plausibly, that their origin is the 
<br>
Middle East region, and that the attacks probably trace back to the 
<br>
Osama Bin Laden network, a widespread and complex organization, 
<br>
doubtless inspired by Bin Laden but not necessarily acting under his 
<br>
control. Let us assume that this is true. Then to answer your 
<br>
question a sensible person would try to ascertain Bin Laden's views, 
<br>
and the sentiments of the large reservoir of supporters he has 
<br>
throughout the region. About all of this, we have a great deal of 
<br>
information. Bin Laden has been interviewed extensively over the 
<br>
years by highly reliable Middle East specialists, notably the most 
<br>
eminent correspondent in the region, Robert Fisk (London 
<br>
_Independent_), who has intimate knowledge of the entire region and 
<br>
direct experience over decades. A Saudi Arabian millionaire, Bin 
<br>
Laden became a militant Islamic leader in the war to drive the 
<br>
Russians out of Afghanistan. He was one of the many religious 
<br>
fundamentalist extremists recruited, armed, and financed by the CIA 
<br>
and their allies in Pakistani intelligence to cause maximal harm to 
<br>
the Russians -- quite possibly delaying their withdrawal, many 
<br>
analysts suspect -- though whether he personally happened to have 
<br>
direct contact with the CIA is unclear, and not particularly 
<br>
important. Not surprisingly, the CIA preferred the most fanatic and 
<br>
cruel fighters they could mobilize. The end result was to &quot;destroy a 
<br>
moderate regime and create a fanatical one, from groups recklessly 
<br>
financed by the Americans&quot; (_London Times_ cor- respondent Simon 
<br>
Jenkins, also a specialist on the region). These &quot;Afghanis&quot; as they 
<br>
are called (many, like Bin Laden, not from Afghanistan) carried out 
<br>
terror operations across the border in Russia, but they terminated 
<br>
these after Russia withdrew. Their war was not against Russia, which 
<br>
they despise, but against the Russian occupation and Russia's crimes 
<br>
against Muslims.
<br>
<p><p>The &quot;Afghanis&quot; did not terminate their activities, however. They 
<br>
joined Bosnian Muslim forces in the Balkan Wars; the US did not 
<br>
object, just as it tolerated Iranian support for them, for complex 
<br>
reasons that we need not pursue here, apart from noting that concern 
<br>
for the grim fate of the Bosnians was not prominent among them. The 
<br>
&quot;Afghanis&quot; are also fighting the Russians in Chechnya, and, quite 
<br>
possibly, are involved in carrying out terrorist attacks in Moscow 
<br>
and elsewhere in Russian territory. Bin Laden and his &quot;Afghanis&quot; 
<br>
turned against the US in 1990 when they established permanent bases 
<br>
in Saudi Arabia -- from his point of view, a counterpart to the 
<br>
Russian occupation of Afghanistan, but far more significant because 
<br>
of Saudi Arabia's special status as the guardian of the holiest 
<br>
shrines.
<br>
<p><p>Bin Laden is also bitterly opposed to the corrupt and repressive 
<br>
regimes of the region, which he regards as &quot;un- Islamic,&quot; including 
<br>
the Saudi Arabian regime, the most extreme Islamic fundamentalist 
<br>
regime in the world, apart from the Taliban, and a close US ally 
<br>
since its origins. Bin Laden despises the US for its support of these 
<br>
regimes. Like others in the region, he is also outraged by long- 
<br>
standing US support for Israel's brutal military occupation, now in 
<br>
its 35th year: Washington's decisive diplomatic, military, and 
<br>
economic intervention in support of the killings, the harsh and 
<br>
destructive siege over many years, the daily humiliation to which 
<br>
Palestinians are subjected, the expanding settlements designed to 
<br>
break the occupied territories into Bantustan-like cantons and take 
<br>
control of the resources, the gross violation of the Geneva 
<br>
Conventions, and other actions that are recognized as crimes 
<br>
throughout most of the world, apart from the US, which has prime 
<br>
responsibility for them. And like others, he contrasts Washington's 
<br>
dedicated support for these crimes with the decade-long US-British 
<br>
assault against the civilian population of Iraq, which has devastated 
<br>
the society and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths while 
<br>
strengthening Saddam Hussein -- who was a favored friend and ally of 
<br>
the US and Britain right through his worst atrocities, including the 
<br>
gassing of the Kurds, as people of the region also remember well, 
<br>
even if Westerners prefer to forget the facts. These sentiments are 
<br>
very widely shared. The _Wall Street Journal_ (Sept. 14) published a 
<br>
survey of opinions of wealthy and privileged Muslims in the Gulf 
<br>
region (bankers, professionals, businessmen with close links to the 
<br>
U.S.). They expressed much the same views: resentment of the U.S. 
<br>
policies of supporting Israeli crimes and blocking the international 
<br>
consensus on a diplomatic settlement for many years while devastating 
<br>
Iraqi civilian society, supporting harsh and repressive 
<br>
anti-democratic regimes throughout the region, and imposing barriers 
<br>
against economic development by &quot;propping up oppressive regimes.&quot; 
<br>
Among the great majority of people suffering deep poverty and 
<br>
oppression, similar sentiments are far more bitter, and are the 
<br>
source of the fury and despair that has led to suicide bombings, as 
<br>
commonly understood by those who are interested in the facts.
<br>
<p><p>The U.S., and much of the West, prefers a more comforting story. To 
<br>
quote the lead analysis in the _New York Times_ (Sept. 16), the 
<br>
perpetrators acted out of &quot;hatred for the values cherished in the 
<br>
West as freedom, tolerance, prosperity, religious pluralism and 
<br>
universal suffrage.&quot; U.S. actions are irrelevant, and therefore need 
<br>
not even be mentioned (Serge Schmemann). This is a convenient 
<br>
picture, and the general stance is not unfamiliar in intellectual 
<br>
history; in fact, it is close to the norm. It happens to be 
<br>
completely at variance with everything we know, but has all the 
<br>
merits of self-adulation and uncritical support for power.
<br>
<p><p>It is also widely recognized that Bin Laden and others like him are 
<br>
praying for &quot;a great assault on Muslim states,&quot; which will cause 
<br>
&quot;fanatics to flock to his cause&quot; (Jenkins, and many others.). That 
<br>
too is familiar. The escalating cycle of violence is typically 
<br>
welcomed by the harshest and most brutal elements on both sides, a 
<br>
fact evident enough from the recent history of the Balkans, to cite 
<br>
only one of many cases.
<br>
<p><p><p>Q: What consequences will they have on US inner policy and to the 
<br>
American self reception?
<br>
<p>US policy has already been officially announced. The world is being 
<br>
offered a &quot;stark choice&quot;: join us, or &quot;face the certain prospect of 
<br>
death and destruction.&quot; Congress has authorized the use of force 
<br>
against any individuals or countries the President determines to be 
<br>
involved in the attacks, a doctrine that every supporter regards as 
<br>
ultra-criminal. That is easily demonstrated. Simply ask how the same 
<br>
people would have reacted if Nicaragua had adopted this doctrine 
<br>
after the U.S. had rejected the orders of the World Court to 
<br>
terminate its &quot;unlawful use of force&quot; against Nicaragua and had 
<br>
vetoed a Security Council resolution calling on all states to observe 
<br>
international law. And that terrorist attack was far more severe and 
<br>
destructive even than this atrocity.
<br>
<p><p>As for how these matters are perceived here, that is far more 
<br>
complex. One should bear in mind that the media and the intellectual 
<br>
elites generally have their particular agendas. Furthermore, the 
<br>
answer to this question is, in significant measure, a matter of 
<br>
decision: as in many other cases, with sufficient dedication and 
<br>
energy, efforts to stimulate fanaticism, blind hatred, and submission 
<br>
to authority can be reversed. We all know that very well.
<br>
<p><p><p>Q: Do you expect U.S. to profoundly change their policy to the rest 
<br>
of the world?
<br>
<p>The initial response was to call for intensifying the policies that 
<br>
led to the fury and resentment that provides the background of 
<br>
support for the terrorist attack, and to pursue more intensively the 
<br>
agenda of the most hard line elements of the leadership: increased 
<br>
militarization, domestic regimentation, attack on social programs. 
<br>
That is all to be expected. Again, terror attacks, and the escalating 
<br>
cycle of violence they often engender, tend to reinforce the 
<br>
authority and prestige of the most harsh and re- pressive elements of 
<br>
a society. But there is nothing inevitable about submission to this 
<br>
course.
<br>
<p><p><p>Q: After the first shock, came fear of what the U.S. answer is going 
<br>
to be. Are you afraid, too?
<br>
<p>Every sane person should be afraid of the likely reaction -- the one 
<br>
that has already been announced, the one that probably answers Bin 
<br>
Laden's prayers. It is highly likely to escalate the cycle of 
<br>
violence, in the familiar way, but in this case on a far greater 
<br>
scale.
<br>
<p><p>The U.S. has already demanded that Pakistan terminate the food and 
<br>
other supplies that are keeping at least some of the starving and 
<br>
suffering people of Afghanistan alive. If that demand is implemented, 
<br>
unknown numbers of people who have not the remotest connection to 
<br>
terrorism will die, possibly millions. Let me repeat: the U.S. has 
<br>
demanded that Pakistan kill possibly millions of people who are 
<br>
themselves victims of the Taliban. This has nothing to do even with 
<br>
revenge. It is at a far lower moral level even than that. The 
<br>
significance is heightened by the fact that this is mentioned in 
<br>
passing, with no comment, and probably will hardly be noticed. We can 
<br>
learn a great deal about the moral level of the reigning intellectual 
<br>
culture of the West by observing the reaction to this demand. I think 
<br>
we can be reasonably confident that if the American population had 
<br>
the slightest idea of what is being done in their name, they would be 
<br>
utterly appalled. It would be instructive to seek historical 
<br>
precedents.
<br>
<p><p>If Pakistan does not agree to this and other U.S. demands, it may 
<br>
come under direct attack as well -- with unknown consequences. If 
<br>
Pakistan does submit to U.S. demands, it is not impossible that the 
<br>
government will be overthrown by forces much like the Taliban -- who 
<br>
in this case will have nuclear weapons. That could have an effect 
<br>
throughout the region, including the oil producing states. At this 
<br>
point we are considering the possibility of a war that may destroy 
<br>
much of human society.
<br>
<p><p>Even without pursuing such possibilities, the likelihood is that an 
<br>
attack on Afghans will have pretty much the effect that most analysts 
<br>
expect: it will enlist great numbers of others to support of Bin 
<br>
Laden, as he hopes. Even if he is killed, it will make little 
<br>
difference. His voice will be heard on cassettes that are distributed 
<br>
throughout the Islamic world, and he is likely to be revered as a 
<br>
martyr, inspiring others. It is worth bearing in mind that one 
<br>
suicide bombing -- a truck driven into a U.S. military base -- drove 
<br>
the world's major military force out of Lebanon 20 years ago. The 
<br>
opportunities for such attacks are endless. And suicide attacks are 
<br>
very hard to prevent.
<br>
<p><p><p>Q: &quot;The world will never be the same after 11.09.01&quot;. Do you think so?
<br>
<p>The horrendous terrorist attacks on Tuesday are something quite new 
<br>
in world affairs, not in their scale and character, but in the 
<br>
target. For the US, this is the first time since the War of 1812 that 
<br>
its national territory has been under attack, even threat. It's 
<br>
colonies have been attacked, but not the national territory itself. 
<br>
During these years the US virtually exterminated the indigenous 
<br>
population, conquered half of Mexico, intervened violently in the 
<br>
surrounding region, conquered Hawaii and the Philippines (killing 
<br>
hundreds of thousands of Filipinos), and in the past half century 
<br>
particularly, extended its resort to force throughout much of the 
<br>
world. The number of victims is colossal. For the first time, the 
<br>
guns have been directed the other way. The same is true, even more 
<br>
dramatically, of Europe. Europe has suffered murderous destruction, 
<br>
but from internal wars, meanwhile conquering much of the world with 
<br>
extreme brutality. It has not been under attack by its victims 
<br>
outside, with rare exceptions (the IRA in England, for example). It 
<br>
is therefore natural that NATO should rally to the support of the US; 
<br>
hundreds of years of imperial violence have an enormous impact on the 
<br>
intellectual and moral culture.
<br>
<p><p>It is correct to say that this is a novel event in world history, not 
<br>
because of the scale of the atrocity -- regrettably -- but because of 
<br>
the target. How the West chooses to react is a matter of supreme 
<br>
importance. If the rich and powerful choose to keep to their 
<br>
traditions of hundreds of years and resort to extreme violence, they 
<br>
will contribute to the escalation of a cycle of violence, in a 
<br>
familiar dynamic, with long-term consequences that could be awesome. 
<br>
Of course, that is by no means inevitable. An aroused public within 
<br>
the more free and democratic societies can direct policies towards a 
<br>
much more humane and honorable course.
