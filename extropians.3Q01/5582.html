Mike responded to my post about impatience with people's suffering largely
<br>
by talking about why he disagrees with lawsuits for reparations.
<br>
<p>Mike, I hope the above summary does not distort your post too unfairly - or
<br>
unfairly at all.
<br>
<p>As it happens, I agree with some of what you say, as I usually do, but I
<br>
find it difficult to sort out because there is this thread of impatience
<br>
with the issues running through it. I mean, why the almost total emphasis on
<br>
reparations? I do not support such reparations suits and have never
<br>
expressed support for them. I don't even support afirmative action in the
<br>
sense of quotas. Just before we get away from lawsuits, you'd find me an
<br>
ally for the general idea that tort law is being pushed too far until it is
<br>
becoming a hindrance to individual freedom. Some of my positions are
<br>
probably more moderate versions of yours, rather than those of people you
<br>
consider opponents. You may prefer &quot;wishy-washy&quot; or something where I wrote
<br>
&quot;moderate&quot;. If so, so be it. I'm not ashamed to display enough empathy to
<br>
soften the stances that I might otherwise take if motivated solely by my
<br>
strong commitment to freedom.
<br>
<p><p>In the past, I have expressed a dislike for political correctness, though I
<br>
have never nailed down what it is. For the moment, suffice to say, that I
<br>
became highly disenchanted as far back as the 1980s with the way the Left
<br>
was headed where there had to be one &quot;correct line&quot; on everything. For
<br>
example, the &quot;correct line&quot; on sex or gender issues, or whatever you want to
<br>
call them, became an extraordinary puritanism, contrary to all my small-l
<br>
libertarian instincts. The correct line on racial issues in this country
<br>
currently seems to be support for some kind of Aboriginal separatism, which
<br>
I oppose.
<br>
<p>You would probably find me to be an ally on many issues, not just
<br>
transhumanism.
<br>
<p>Getting to the point, however, I do not suggest anywhere in my post that we
<br>
should feel *guilt* about slavery (or, in the Australian context, the
<br>
actions of forcible removal of Aboriginal kids from parents that led to the
<br>
modern  expression &quot;the stolen generations&quot;). In my post, I suggested that,
<br>
in fact, no reputable thinker argues for this. Maybe someone will come up
<br>
with a counterexample, but what I and other &quot;reputable&quot; thinkers say is
<br>
*not* that Mike or anyone else need feel guilty about slavery. We merely say
<br>
that the treatment of African blacks, Australian Aborigines and many others
<br>
was deplorable tested against the values that we hold, however
<br>
understandable given the values of Europeans at the time. Actually, the word
<br>
&quot;deplorable&quot; does not do justice to the issue. If we actually think back to
<br>
what was involved, the suffering anfd dislocation that occurred on a massive
<br>
scale, the destruction of cultural ties, the treatment of people on the
<br>
basis that they were subhuman... and terrible aftermath, short-term and
<br>
longer term, it is impossible not to pity both the dead and the living who
<br>
have inherited the outcome. (If you think &quot;pity&quot; is the wrong word for
<br>
people who are now dead and so beyond our reach, find another word; the
<br>
feeling is real enough whatever you call it, and you feel it whenever you
<br>
read a vivid account of part of what happened, revealing some of what people
<br>
went through.)
<br>
<p>In that context, a sense of vicarious shame (not personal shame and
<br>
certainly not guilt) is appropriate, at least for those of us who feel
<br>
vicarious pride at the history of our countries. If you're so ultra-rational
<br>
that you don't feel such pride, which seems to be where Eliezer is coming
<br>
from, then I can find no logical flaw in your position. However, most of us
<br>
who try to enter into the issues patiently and imaginatively do have this
<br>
kind of feeling of shame as *part* of what we feel about the histories of
<br>
countries. I think that Mike, for one, is overly dismissive of this and not
<br>
prepared to really consider it - at least that is the sense I get with the
<br>
tired &quot;not guilty&quot; response.
<br>
<p>Of course, all this is only a starting point. When we get down to questions
<br>
of what should actually be done in response to the historical and ongoing
<br>
tragedy of race relations, you'll probably find me taking a position which
<br>
is not the correct line on the left, ie a &quot;politically incorrect&quot; position.
<br>
But, whatever position we take, we should at least form it *out of* feelings
<br>
of empathy and an imaginative grasp of the terrible experiences involved,
<br>
not let ourselves be dominated by irritation at solutions we don't like or
<br>
leaders on the other side whom we find venal or hypocritical or annoying.
<br>
<p>Mike, I wish we could meet halfway on this. We probably couldn't agree on
<br>
solutions because I am happy to have a role for the state (albeit a
<br>
relatively modest one) whereas you are not. But I'd dearly like to persuade
<br>
you that it is worth starting with empathy, then seeing how far your
<br>
abstract philosophy will stretch (I'm not asking you to give up principles
<br>
that you find intellectually convincing), rather than seeming to dismiss the
<br>
problem. I read lots of your posts and know you have a good mind. You often
<br>
say useful things about, for example, truth-relativism, many of which I
<br>
actually agree with. But I just don't think you do issues like this justice
<br>
because of this impatience and irritation with them that I think you show.
<br>
<p>I do have to add, in fairness, that I acknowedge the reasonableness of the
<br>
tone in which you address me personally. And I can see *some* of why you are
<br>
so irritated at the issues and the leaders on the other side. &lt;Sigh&gt;, maybe
<br>
I'll end there for the moment.
<br>
<p>Back to you or to anyone who wants to take this further.
<br>
<p>Russell
