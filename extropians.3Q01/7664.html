</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; See what happens to close minded people?  They draw highly inaccurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; parallels and get somewhat insulting of those who think differently.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; obviously is quite important to recognize what it is that we do that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a little is also for our faults, especially faults of policy and of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idea that you (the US) are somehow responsible for these attacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has some popularity here in France. But on this instance, it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem true. The islamists just want to impose their world order,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to their sense of justice. It has little to do with wrongs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would have done according to YOUR sense of justice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm.  Saying &quot;the islamists&quot; above implies all Islamic people
<br>
want 
<br>
this.  This is clearly false.  Some radical fundie Islamic sects
<br>
want
<br>
this just like some radical fundie Christian sects want
<br>
something similar.  But it would be incorrect to imply Islam
<br>
itself or Christianity itself requires any such thing of all its
<br>
adherents.
<br>
<p>Wanting in general to produce such a world by itself would not
<br>
focus the energy on America in particular necessarily.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; A French editorialist (Serge July) ended an article recently saying :
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;we should remember that the only real solution to terrorism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justice&quot;. This is an illusion : you just cannot imagine that, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world being fair according to your sense of justice, a large group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people could want to kill you ; but as a matter of fact, that's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way it is. According to their sense of justice, your very life is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an offense to the Creator. They hate you. Not for what you have done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to them ; for your (lack of) beliefs, for your way of living, for your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Infidelity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Such hatred is not compatible with much of most religious belief
<br>
systems or their literature.  It is practiced by some subset of
<br>
some
<br>
religious groups.  It is quite questionable even within their
<br>
religion.  Such questioning by other members of their religion
<br>
of differening opinions is probably one of the fastest peaceful
<br>
ways to diffuse such &quot;religious&quot; hatred.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If we cannot admit where there are valid claims against us and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; act to correct such things where possible then we are irresponsible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and dishonest as a nation and as individual citizens of that nation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The word &quot;valid&quot; is the problem. Their claims (like having Jews out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Palestine, and having US out of Saoudi, and finally extending islam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the planet) are valid according to them, but not according to you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (well, to me at least). As this translates in attacks on you, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot afford so much tolerance as to treat them as &quot;valid&quot;, even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are valid in some sense (= they are consistant with their sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of justice).
</em><br>
<p><p>Even without these very questionable things there are many
<br>
claims that are perfectly valid where we did in fact act in a
<br>
slimey and underhanded fashion.  We can at least address those
<br>
honestly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I personally find it quite disturbing when Bush said that other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; countries are either with us and by implicaiton with our policies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our &quot;war on terrorism&quot; or are with the terrorists.  That is a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dangerous and blatantly false dichotomy.  One can be very much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; against terrorism and still not believe the planned and proposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actions are reasonable and not back them.  The same is true of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nations.  Just because we have been hurt badly is not an excuse for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; polarizing the world into &quot;for US&quot; and &quot;against US&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course this is a bit of a constraint. But I think it is quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understandable. The US have been hurt, they seek back up. It doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem very responsible from us (France) to decline it -- and then ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more support from you when things go worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sure but this is not the point.  France should not support US
<br>
policies and actions on this blindly any more than Americans
<br>
should.  Freedom includes the right to freely question and to
<br>
disagree.  It
<br>
doesn't make you or your country complicit in terrorism if you
<br>
do
<br>
disagree.
