<p>
The debate on this issue is going to become important very soon as new laws
<br>
are considered.  Listening to the public officials talk about encryption
<br>
limits shows how little this subject is understood by them, or the public.
<br>
The most important thing to understand is that the cat is already out of the
<br>
bag, and sewing the bag shut, no matter how well stitched, is not going to
<br>
do any good, but the foolish attempt can do harm.
<br>
<p>In general cryptography, it has been known from the early days that one time
<br>
codes based on properly generated random bits are unbreakable.  However, one
<br>
time codes have been considered too inconvenient to be practical, whereas
<br>
algorithmic codes are very practical, and in the case of public key systems,
<br>
great for commerce.  But no amount of limitation of algorithmic codes
<br>
changes the basic fact that bad guys can use one time codes.
<br>
<p>Data storage technology, over the last ten years, has changed the
<br>
situation.  It is now possible for someone to carry around a chip with
<br>
enough pre-recorded random bits in it to last longer than anyone can type.
<br>
It is now possible for such a chip to be inserted under the skin (see the RF
<br>
ID stuff) and be accessed by a palm device.  New laws cannot stop any of
<br>
this.
<br>
<p>Steganography has value on more than one level.  Traditionally, it was
<br>
valuable (when it worked) to send messages without anyone knowing that you
<br>
were sending messages.  But it is also valuable when used to maintain
<br>
deniability.  If I publish a page of random numbers, I may also be sending a
<br>
message, but you cannot prove that I am unless you can break it.  If you
<br>
haul me into court and demand I supply you with a key,  I can claim that
<br>
they are just numbers, and that there is no key, or I can give you a key
<br>
that is the length of the block which converts it into any message I want
<br>
you to see.
<br>
<p>Harvey has indicated that steganography alone is not useful, and Eugene has
<br>
noted the power of any big blob of public bits.  I agree.  For steganography
<br>
to be useful it has to be combined with strong encryption.  This combination
<br>
can make it undetectable.  I can put a digital recording of a poem reading
<br>
on my web that sounds perfectly normal, and stands up to any statistical
<br>
analysis.  However, that tape hiss you hear in the background ...
<br>
<p>What it comes down to is that no new law will do any good.  Let us work to
<br>
be sure that bad laws are not passed.  It would be especially bad if we lost
<br>
the right to speak that which makes no sense.
<br>
