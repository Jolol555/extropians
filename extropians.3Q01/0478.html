<p>How many of us would ever have bothered
<br>
<em>&gt;to learn programming if not to advance our careers?  How many of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those who would have programmed anyway would have gotten as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good at it as we are had not it advanced our careers?  Think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;poverty as a drill sergeant: in your face for sure, but he ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt;benefits you by teaching you to get with the program.
</em><br>
<p>This sounds like a very pessimistic view to me. I certainly have not been 
<br>
motivated by a fear of poverty in developing my various skills and areas of 
<br>
expertise as far as I can take them. I am motivated by developing myself for 
<br>
its own sake. I want to test my limits, to go beyond those walls that I 
<br>
regularly hit, and even to get sufficient abilities to solve the difficult 
<br>
problems that interest me. Sure, it's nice if I can make some serious money 
<br>
as a by-product.
<br>
<p>I'm prepared to admit that I've been motivated over the years by a hunger 
<br>
for fame and glory (a hunger which remains largely unsatisfied, alas). But 
<br>
decisions I've made merely to avoid *poverty* - often meaning obtaining 
<br>
competence at things that the labour market has valued at the particular 
<br>
time - have held back my self-development more than accelerated it.
<br>
<p>Here's to the party of joy and freedom!
