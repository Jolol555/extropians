<p><p>Good on you Damien. I am relieved that some Americans have noticed this 
<br>
too. It seems obvious to others outside USA, but it is rarely mentioned
<br>
by 
<br>
anybody.
<br>
<p>I really wince when some of the more patriotic on this list say that USA
<br>
is 
<br>
the most powerful country because it is the land of the free. Sounds so 
<br>
much like those British who were still singing &quot;Rule Britannia,
<br>
Britannia 
<br>
rules the waves&quot; when their colonial empire was going down the drain...
<br>
and 
<br>
the Romans at the height of their domination, feeling that they were the
<br>
<p>greatest.
<br>
<p>I am sure that if Oz was a major super-power there would be plenty here
<br>
who 
<br>
thought that we were the best and deserved our position. Hopefully I
<br>
would 
<br>
not be one of them. Patriotism is down there with religion as one of the
<br>
<p>darkest and most dangerous memes.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
