<p>Not necessarily. If believers can simply believe that we all have a
<br>
choice, I think that is 99% of the battle right there. Let's be real.
<br>
Religion in the U.S. seems pretty harmless. Even so, believers might
<br>
have future value as shock troops. I don't expect an openly atheistic
<br>
president anytime soon, and policy positions are much more important.
<br>
Besides, the republican party depends on these folks, especially the
<br>
more fundamentalist believers. It seems obvious most thinking americans
<br>
are somewhat to the left of extropians. Don't think of religion as
<br>
something which threatens you, think of it as something you can *use*.
<br>
Muahahahah.
