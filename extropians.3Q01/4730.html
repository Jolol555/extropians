Consider adding some &quot;good fats&quot; to it like from flax oil or fish oil

Subject: DIET: Low carb report
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Hi folks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since there has been interest in the past on the topic of diets and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nutrition, I thought I would post the results/side-effects of my most
</em><br>
recent
<br>
<em>&gt; experiment with such things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; About five weeks ago I agreed to provide &quot;morale support&quot; to one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; girls I live with, who insisted that she needs to lose five pounds (from
</em><br>
her
<br>
<em>&gt; petite 115-lb body -- go figure), by doing a low carb diet with her.  I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not in particular need of a diet, but I'm not super-lean either despite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spending much time at the gym, so I figured it would be an interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment.  My normal diet tends to be a low-fat, medium dairy, medium
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protein diet with lots of carbs and vegetables.  I also attend the gym
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regularly (at least for the last several months), so I also like to see
</em><br>
how
<br>
<em>&gt; various diets interact with my workout.  My new diet is a high-protein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-fat diet with lots of non-starchy vegetables and water.  Note that I
</em><br>
do
<br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;two days on, one day off&quot; cycle for the diet; I eat plenty of quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carbs on the off day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  It makes you lean with surprising speed.  I've never seen anything
</em><br>
else
<br>
<em>&gt; like it -- the fat just melted off my body.  This is the only diet I've
</em><br>
ever
<br>
<em>&gt; seen that actually produced results like this and at this speed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  It doesn't interfere with a heavy workout schedule.  I've tried other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low-fat diets to try to become leaner, but they all seemed to have adverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affects on my workout scheduling, either by making recovery take longer or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just making my muscles feel lethargic (a problem I've had with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vegetarian-ish diets in general).  No problems here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3)  Dairy is bad.  This was the only change I made to the diet mid-course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apparently a low-carb diet aggravates the negative effects of diary in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet and generally didn't make me feel that good, so I cut back on them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substantially and stuck with meat and veggies.  I've always known that
</em><br>
dairy
<br>
<em>&gt; wasn't so hot, but this made it that much clearer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4)  No hunger.  This is more than just an issue of an empty stomach.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found that the time I could comfortably go between meals was greatly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extended beyond my normal diet as well.  I am guessing this has something
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; do with very stable blood sugar levels.  Note that low-fat high-carb diets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always seemed to increase the frequency that I felt hungry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In summary, I feel great, better than I do on my normal diet.  Because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this, it is extraordinarily easy to stick with it, and the adjustments
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; been minor, particularly since every third day I eat carbs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given the quality of the results I've had, I will probably make lean meat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and veggies my standard diet until something better comes along; my body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems quite happy with this diet.  I'm normally skeptical of these things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but only because most dietary changes appeared to generate adverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences to my body and/or my lifestyle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cheers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
