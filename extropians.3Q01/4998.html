Love the stories. :-)

<p><em>&gt;My view is that, except for some special cases in children where you can

<p>Back in the 70s I read of an interesting experiment where a class of kids 
<br>
were given an intelligence test and the experimenters did a weird thing 
<br>
with the results. They switched the scores of the high half of the class 
<br>
with the scores of the low half of the class. They misinformed the teachers 
<br>
as to the results, then went away. I think it was 6 months later the 
<br>
experimenters did their tests again on the class, and lo! the results now 
<br>
really did tally with the previously faked results.
<br>
<p>It seems that IQ is a measure not only of how well you do IQ tests, but 
<br>
also how well other people think you will do on IQ tests.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
