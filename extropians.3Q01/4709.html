<em>&gt; Education *was* better when it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; completely private and more poor people got a better education.  It isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; really even in dispute.  Who's waving arms?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your insularity is showing.  You say education was better when it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely private and that this isn't even in dispute?  Well, I'm disputing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  What else can't be disputed?  That Gone With The Wind depicted the end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the America's greatest epoch?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What I didn't mention was the years in the early 19th century when there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; both public AND private education equally available in the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You also forgot to mention that (during the time you depict) it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *illegal* for some people in the U.S. to even learn to read.
</em><br>
<p>Just what the HELL does that have to do with it? Sounds like one more
<br>
case of the whiny liberal resorting to a last ditch attempt at labelling
<br>
her opponents racist to escape a losing position.
<br>
<p>Or are YOU implying that the descendants of those who were prohibited
<br>
from learning to read are inherently less able to be educated today????
<br>
That sounds like a pretty racist opinion to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So tell me again how public education and the government helped the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; poor people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gladly.  Public education does not sanction discrimination based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion, ethnicity, class, and what have you (that is to say, it has truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become more democratic lately - if only in the last few decades - and, in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view, the bulk of good it does by this very fact alone puts it ahead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private education).
</em><br>
<p>Private education cannot discriminate thus (except for religion) either.
<br>
Many private schools offer scholarships to gifted poor kids to attend
<br>
their schools. There is this thing, see, called financial aid.... I
<br>
suggest you get rid of the ComIntern originated memes against private
<br>
organizations that seem to be embedded in you.
