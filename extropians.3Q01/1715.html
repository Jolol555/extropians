<p>Cool, thanks Daniel. I shall keep my eye open for them.
<br>
<p>I should say that normally I don't read fantasy. Hard science fiction, 
<br>
science fact, and computer manuals making up most of my reading material, 
<br>
but I have had so many friends recommend Harry Potter stories to me that I 
<br>
decided to give it a go. I was very pleasantly surprised.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
