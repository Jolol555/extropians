<p>
Robert,
<br>
<p>Thank you for this well reasoned piece regarding religion.  It
<br>
largely maps to what I have seen and experienced.  I will add,
<br>
however, that in my experience it is very difficult to hold a
<br>
well-integrated (non compartmentalized) religious belief system
<br>
and still function very extropically.  In particular, it is all
<br>
too easy to go on &quot;spiritual intuition&quot; and what one wishes were
<br>
true and try to lift oneself up by the metaphorical/metaphysical
<br>
bootstraps.  This can often result in becoming a bit separate
<br>
from the &quot;real world&quot; or maybe &quot;simulation&quot; and not so very
<br>
effective therein.  
<br>
<p>Now, if this is indeed a simulation, then not being so effective
<br>
in the simulation but actually finding (assuming this is
<br>
possible for now) what is behind the simulation, would be quite
<br>
reasonable.  But if this is not a simulation and one is busy
<br>
trying to find what does not exist then it is likely that this
<br>
life is wasted and perhaps others around you are led to waste
<br>
their lives in such a manner also. If this is a simulation and
<br>
we treat it as real and it is possible to do a &quot;Thirteenth
<br>
Floor&quot; and create a simulation within the simulation then I
<br>
would think that would &quot;graduate&quot; us faster than attempting to
<br>
&quot;pierce the veil&quot; using mystical practices and such.
<br>
<p>In the realm of values and particularly in the realm of
<br>
psychological/spiritual techniques for stepping out of being
<br>
bound by our evolutionary wiring to some extent, I believe
<br>
religion/spirituality has a tremendous amount to teach. That
<br>
sort of stuff will be increasingly important as our powers and
<br>
environment go increasingly beyond what our biological wiring
<br>
was designed for. I believe it also has much to offer in binding
<br>
together groups of people and in practical memetic engineering.  
<br>
<p>But I will be the first to acknowledge, from my own experiences,
<br>
that it is can also be quite dangerous.  It is especially
<br>
dangerous for those who, like me, do not compartmentalize well,
<br>
if at all.

<p><em>&gt; I think I'll argue that &quot;religion&quot; is a suitcase term.

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion: 1. belief in and worhip of God or gods; 2. a specific system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of belief or worship, etc. built around God, a code of ethics, a philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of life, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is nothing wrong with having a &quot;religion&quot; that is based on a system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of beliefs that can be rationally justified or one that openly acknowledges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its inability to be rationally justified.  For example a religion of worshiping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;God&quot;, the creator of the simulation, seems perfectly reasonable to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if it also acknowledges that there is no way of knowing whether or not we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are in a simulation.  It might marginally increase ones chances of getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uplifted out of the simulation and so being a member of the &quot;Church of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Simulation&quot; be argued as a rationally wise life strategy.  The fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem is that most religions breed lazy minds.  You &quot;believe&quot; the moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system and history offered by the religion and do not subject it to critical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (rational) analysis.  The problem is not the &quot;beliefs&quot; but how one comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to believe them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The basic principles of most religions result in behavioral axioms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we know are extropic -- thou shalt not lie, thou shalt not kill,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do unto others as you would have them do unto you, etc.  These fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles are extropic because they generate trust for fellow humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which allows us to interact in ways that are more efficient from a game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theoretic perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The useless hypothesis here is not &quot;religion&quot; per se.  It is irrational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith or faith based on a lack of evidence that does not openly acknowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such lack of evidence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The extropic perspective should not be to dump on &quot;religion&quot; per se.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The extropic perspective would be to open the minds of people to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variety of religions that may be equally valid and in so doing perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discover the core set of values and perspectives that uplift humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a whole.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As Charlie's excellent essay points out, the Islamic preservation of large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amounts of &quot;Western&quot; knowledge contributed greatly to the reformation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and uplifting of Western society from the Dark Ages to what we have today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Likewise, the copying of many Greek and Latin books by monks during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dark Ages preserved a heritage that might otherwise have been lost.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Religion is not the problem.  It is blind acceptance of a religion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is.
</em><br>
