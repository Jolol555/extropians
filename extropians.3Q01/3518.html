<br>
<em>&gt; This experiment is something else I didn't understand.  Is this related to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the challenge for liberals to provide aid and comfort to their ideological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemies?  Are they the same experiment?
</em><br>
<p>No, not at all. This experiment has nothing whatever to do with ideology. In
<br>
fact, it's the diametric opposite of ideology, and involves looking beyond the
<br>
word-dominated world. What you find by turning your back on the mythology
<br>
generated by our social order is so profound that one feels like sharing it
<br>
(presumptuous though this may be perceived) because it indicts the
<br>
word-manipulated mass of humanity and demands a kind of civil disobedience,
<br>
which means living in harmony with our inner heroic nature and not according
<br>
to the intimidation and demands of ideology.
<br>
Rediscovering your natural individual sovereignty and your right to think for
<br>
yourself by stripping away the false programming of organized policy,
<br>
abandoning all belief systems, embarking on a path of honest observation,
<br>
sincere investigation, and choiceless awareness, is what this experiment
<br>
involves.
<br>
The idea that anyone can give you &quot;the truth&quot; is as absurd as imagining that
<br>
someone else can take a bath for you. As Kabir (one of my favorite rational
<br>
poets) has written, &quot;All that is essential is direct experience of reality.&quot;
<br>
My intention is to share the way to this experience. (I'm directing folks to
<br>
the bathroom, so to speak.) Direct experience of reality is the way to
<br>
cognitive liberation.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, and ego.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
