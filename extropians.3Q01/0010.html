<p>It would certainly make viewing the movie more memorable.  But you
<br>
have to make sure you are right, otherwise you would be spreading
<br>
potentially incorrect memes.

<p><em>&gt; So when I saw it in A.I., I wondered how thick would need to be

</em><br>
<em>&gt; My first order estimates are that there is perhaps 2% of the earth's

</em><br>
<p>Actually the ice in Antarctica is several km thick.  And as Hal and
<br>
his references (THANK YOU HAL!) point out, the rise is not completely
<br>
out of the question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As in the case with the waterglass, the warmer water would expand
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Yep, that combined with Hal's numbers seems to make the scenario
<br>
quite plausible.
