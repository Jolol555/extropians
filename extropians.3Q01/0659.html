From: &quot;Miriam English&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:miriam@werple.net.au?Subject=Re:%20Artificial%20Reality&In-Reply-To=&lt;010001c10909$a7a8d5a0$9e5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">miriam@werple.net.au</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; The first two are sadly true, but the third is only temporarily true. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will cease to be as soon as AIs become at all common. Then human xenophobia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will ensure AIs rank below us in the human-centered scale of universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importance.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, the thing described at
<br>
<a href="http://www.thebunker.net/net_230998.htm">http://www.thebunker.net/net_230998.htm</a>
<br>
leads me to think that AI will become even more valuable than immense wealth.
<br>
<p>Possessiveness trumps xenophobia:
<br>
&quot;Touch our AI and you die, orga,&quot; say the capitalist overlords (who are also
<br>
orgas, or perhaps cyborgs), because their AIs have made them rich beyond
<br>
imagination.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact I have a feeling also that mega-wealth's high rank is weakening.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is this scent in the breeze of late... Do you hear it whispered from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time to time?... what the world could be if money went back to being just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trading tokens...
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's the sound of day traders and shysters seducing investors and VCs,
<br>
making it easier to separate them from their real currency. Much of the dotcom
<br>
bubble bursting derives from &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; relating to the
<br>
over-hyped &quot;new economy&quot; which predicted digi-cash and e-money.
<br>
<p>The feeling that you have probably resembles the feeling Lenin had way back
<br>
when he dreamed of toiletizing capitalism. The &quot;scent in the breeze&quot;? I dunno.
<br>
Whatcha been smokin'? Just kidding.
<br>
<p>But seriously, going backwards as you suggest, to happier times when people
<br>
supposedly didn't worship money, would also mean going back to an age when
<br>
people didn't have nearly as much time to trade tokens as we do today... since
<br>
they only lived two or three decades. For all its seeming callousness and
<br>
cruelty, capitalism has brought us to the world of opportunity that we have
<br>
now.
<br>
<p>It's my contention that capitalism will continue to drive the search for (and
<br>
the attainment of) AI.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, CYC, and ELIZA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
