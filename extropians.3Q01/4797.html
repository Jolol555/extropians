<em>&gt;From: &quot;Mitchell, Jerry (3337)&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:Jerry.Mitchell@esavio.com?Subject=RE:%20Paying%20for%20Schools%20(was:%20SOCIETY:%20Re:%20The%20privatization%20of%20pu%20blic%20security)&In-Reply-To=&lt;F173sclWXSZ3Zs3Mpw600010f4c@hotmail.com&gt;">Jerry.Mitchell@esavio.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;You neglect the impact of  economies of scale. Right now, there isnt much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an impact, but if all schools were private, the situation would be quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pronounced. Besides, theres no studies that show a difference in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of education declining if classroom sizes increase from say 30 to 50. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sounds like there should be, but it reality, if you have 30 students, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dont have a lot of time with individual students anyways. Double the size 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the class and you can drop prices dramatically.
</em><br>
<p>Let me be sure I have this straight...  You are suggesting getting rid of 
<br>
(free) public school where the student:teacher ratio is ~ 30:1 and having 
<br>
every family pay $2K - $5K per year (per kid) for a school where the 
<br>
student:teacher ratio is 50:1?  Is that *really* what you are suggesting, or 
<br>
am I missing something?
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
