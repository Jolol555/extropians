</em><br>
<em>&gt;In what is the ultimate bad news in the global age, Moodys has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;downgraded a number of investments in Argentina to Caa1.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This happened on Friday I believe....
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I read about it by then. It comes as no surprise, really. Last night
<br>
Parliament finally approved the zero-deficit law, by which all state
<br>
wages and expenses will be paid only as much as tax collected during the
<br>
ongoing month allows for, and after paying all that month's national
<br>
debt interests. This might avoid national debt default in theory, but
<br>
the taxing is already perceived as punitive by all big business, so
<br>
tax collection is already dropping. As this schema is already falling
<br>
short, state workers and state retired people are already seeing a 13%
<br>
reduction in their checks this month. It is not clear yet which state
<br>
budgets will be the most affected, there is already talk of closing
<br>
down some state regulation agencies. But these concerns are secondary
<br>
to Moodys and such firms, what they think is most important for
<br>
downgrading Argentine debt titles to the point of almost worthlessness
<br>
is their conviction that the government will not be able to carry this
<br>
last ditch program, as social unrest, strikes and protests will
<br>
make things very nasty.
<br>
<p>It's becoming difficult to ascertain all the parties playing the
<br>
current tug-of-war games. Argentine papers have published convincing
<br>
reports that political elements within US Treasury want to make an
<br>
example of Argentina, and will cut all support once debt default and
<br>
financial collapse happen. If this is true, I can't imagine a better
<br>
way to fire up anti-US and anti-globalization feelings in a population
<br>
that already doesn't believe in anything much. All local political and
<br>
economical actors are completely discredited in Argentina, and there
<br>
is already hidden (and not so hidden) murmurs about &quot;the need for
<br>
an iron hand&quot;, that is a return to authoritarian government.
<br>
<p>So much for people using their heads to deal with the crisis, sigh.
<br>
<p>-Carlos
