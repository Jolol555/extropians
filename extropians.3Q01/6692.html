<p>I spend some time in the Saudi Arabia many years ago.  Islam
<br>
doesn't work quite like this.  While Islamic law is very
<br>
puritantical you have to be formally accused by at least two
<br>
respectable male witnesses before any action is taken against
<br>
you.  In Saudi Arabia, you can find Mercedes parked all over the
<br>
desert outside of Riyad at night.  These are couples meeting for
<br>
discreet illicit rendezvous often.  They are generally not
<br>
disturbed.  Many Saudis also fly away to Bahrain and Thailand to
<br>
have a more relaxed and less restrictive weekend quite often. 
<br>
Such silliness as the above would be seen for what it is.
