<p>Ugh. Yeah, pretty mean stuff. It made me crack up a few times, but I
<br>
hated myself for it each time.
<br>
<p>I'm finally seeing a pattern to this
<br>
<p>1. Somebody comes onto the list, and happens to voice a concern or
<br>
opinion that happens to coincide on one or two memes with something
<br>
that people here associate with a leftist party line.
<br>
<p>2. There is immediately a flurry of retorts that are very convincing
<br>
to the choir, but to a newcomer it sounds just like the callous
<br>
propaganda ve associates with the right-wing party line.
<br>
<p>3. Newcomer and a some allies retreat into the traditional responses
<br>
to these tirades, and the whole thing degenerates into another
<br>
left/right debate disguised as a statist/libertarian debate. Newcomer
<br>
comes to the erroneous conclusion that transhumanism is a rigid,
<br>
right-wing scene.
<br>
<p>How do we remedy this?
<br>
<p>* Above all, let's recognize what we all have in common-- reliance on
<br>
rational thought, a fascination with science and technology, and a
<br>
conviction that they will redefine our lives and our reality... for
<br>
the better. All other issues are secondary to that. Even the wrongest
<br>
list regular probably still 'gets it' more than your typical
<br>
phone-psychic user... or your typical elected official for that
<br>
matter.
<br>
<p>* Perhaps the reason there is so much backlash against concerns over
<br>
discrimination and economic inequality is that Libertarian thinkers
<br>
have been asleep on the job. We're letting the Democrats and
<br>
Socialists own human rights and anytime somebody raises a legitimate
<br>
concern, we respond to them as if they have already shown themselves
<br>
to be a PC meme-bot. That's called doing volunteer recruitment for the
<br>
bad guys! I'd say that anybody who choses to subscribe to this list
<br>
should be assumed to be a freethinker until they show otherwise (not
<br>
necesserily your particular kind of freethinker, but one nonetheless).
<br>
<p>* Those who do have liberal/statist leanings are not blameless
<br>
either. Some of the most virulent opposition to technology is coming
<br>
from the radical left. Why is it that every environmental and
<br>
civil-rights activist I run into has the same ignorant, simplistic
<br>
view of science, progress, and economics? I think if we heard less
<br>
&quot;math is Eurocentric&quot; and &quot;I don't trust Western Medicine&quot; bullshit,
<br>
we wouldn't be treated to that Fred Reed rant. In short, if you choose
<br>
to place yourself in the liberal/statist camp, be extra careful to
<br>
distinguish yourself from the nihilistic Luddites in the tent next to
<br>
you.
