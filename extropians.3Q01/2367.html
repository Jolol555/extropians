<p>Party, the best counterexample to your challenge I can think of is
<br>
found in Mark 16:17,18
<br>
<p>&quot;17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name they shall cast
<br>
out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
<br>
18  They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not
<br>
hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.&quot;
<br>
<p>Nowthen, this is done to this day.  They *do* cast out devils.  First step
<br>
is to convince the victim that they *have* devils.  They do speak in new
<br>
tongues, in fact I have done this myself.  Long story.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, there are deaths every year from yahoos handling
<br>
snakes.  Imagine their surprise when they get bitten and die.  Poison
<br>
drinking knocks off a few boneheads every year.  Now, they do
<br>
lay hands on the sick, and sometimes the sick recover, depending on
<br>
what exactly they are sick with, and what antibiotics are administered
<br>
along with the laying on of hands.
