<em>&gt; This isn't to say that you should give two hoots what they think -- the

<em>&gt; old adage about billions of flies, shit, and good taste springs to

</em><br>
<p>Have you moved around in the business community or the stock trading
<br>
community in the UK at all? Or indeed, associated with any of the
<br>
non-inherited monied groups? I think you'll find that a great many of them
<br>
have objectivist views even if they don't call themselves objectivists.
<br>
<p>But then, that's the case in the US as well. Objectivism is not and has
<br>
never been a mainstream philosophy by my definition of mainstream (which
<br>
pretty much equates to &quot;popular&quot; or &quot;popularist&quot;). [This point can be picked
<br>
up and argued, of course].
<br>
<p>But anyway -- I was objecting to your categorization of objectivism and
<br>
associated concepts as non-existant in the UK, to the point of books by Ayn
<br>
Rand not even being in print. Both these assertions are quite untrue, as I
<br>
can attest to from my years in the UK.
<br>
<p>What the UK, and the rest of Europe, does have is a burgeoning neo-luddite,
<br>
socialist, pro-inteventionist government, left-leaning, anti-capitalist,
<br>
anti-success collection of ideals that are working their way quite
<br>
successfully into the mainstream. It's all very distressing, and one of the
<br>
reasons that I left for a country in which people of talent can still make
<br>
something of themselves without having to justify their success to those
<br>
without said talent.
