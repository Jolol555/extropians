<p>&lt;&lt; What I would have meant if I had written &quot;right to live&quot; is an agreement
<br>
&nbsp;among most members of society that the organism's life should be protected
<br>
&nbsp;from some class of threats, and that people should commit to spending more
<br>
&nbsp;effort fighting any one infringement than would be justified by the harm
<br>
&nbsp;associated with that one infringement. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Hopefully, rapid discoveries in stem cell research, and the technology it 
<br>
spans will eliminate the need for embryonic cells. But an embryo, by 
<br>
definition is not a fetus, so appeals against late term abortions get 
<br>
reduced, but never silenced. Adult stem cell research seems promising indeed, 
<br>
but the researchers themselves will move offshore (literally) to pursue 
<br>
biological advances, whether the anti-abortion movement agrees or not. My 
<br>
guess is that they would next try to get a law passed that would order jail 
<br>
time for American scientists who perform such research in a foreign country, 
<br>
and then return. I am not joking on this one. 
<br>
<p>As far as the Thread, &quot;why immortality?&quot;,  I believe its because even the 
<br>
humblest of us, might, with time and learning, aspire to help implement 
<br>
useful things such as terra-forming uninhabited and uninhabitable places in 
<br>
the solar system. This is useful for multi-species preservation, including 
<br>
the perceived new species of robot-life that humans and A.I. packages might 
<br>
ascend to. If there ever is a super solar flare or a nova, trans-carbon life 
<br>
may do nearly as poorly as carbon life.
