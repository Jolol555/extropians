<em>&gt; &gt; The better schools go to Uni because the students do better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the year 12 exams, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is no restriction, it is based on merit, but of course the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;good&quot; schools give their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; students a better education, so they are over-represented at unis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this depends on which state you are from.  in Queensland, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high school you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attend has a huge influence on wether you get to attend uni 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not since your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; final score is based on a combination of how you did compared 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the rest of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; class and how that class did compared with the rest of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classes in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state.  there is no individual competition among every member 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the state, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if you top your class by a megaparsec, if your class average at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standardised skills test is low compared to other classes, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are going to end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up with a mediocre score.  This is all relatively new since 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it started in 1992.
</em><br>
<p>I went through the same system (the ACT also does ASAT). Having high marks
<br>
is kind of weird, because your marks get standardised and normalised all
<br>
over the shop; if you are a couple of standard deviations out from the mean,
<br>
there is no predicting where your marks will end up; probably it's roughly
<br>
equivalent in complexity to the three-body problem. 
<br>
<p>Seriously though, getting into uni isn't too tricky here, especially if you
<br>
are wanting to do a straight science degree (as I did). The year that I
<br>
graduated from high school, I needed to be in the top 45% of graduates...
<br>
not a big ask!!! If you want to do law or medicine here, though, you might
<br>
want to look at min/maxing your marks somewhat :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As for paying off your education, it is apercentage of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salary, you pay it if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; earn more thana  certain threshold, and you pay back the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debt, not a flat rate on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; salary for life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i don't think he was implying you had to pay for life.
</em><br>
<p>No, I wasn't. Although it does tend to take a while to pay off. If you get a
<br>
general Bachelor of Arts, I think the stats say that you are likely to never
<br>
pay it all back.
<br>
<p>The system, for those who are interested, is that there are a series of
<br>
income bracket / percentage pairs, so that you pay a percentage of your
<br>
gross income back in HECS.
<br>
<p>Predictably, when the scheme was brought in it was pretty gentle (don't pay
<br>
anything back unless you are earning at least 28K, and max repayment was
<br>
about 4% of income I think). That's been changed in recent years, such that
<br>
people earning about 20K now have to pay 2% of their gross income back per
<br>
annum, and such that I've been paying back 6% of mine for the last few
<br>
years. 
<br>
<p>I had a pretty large debt (over 15K, due to my gaining a 3 year BSc in a bit
<br>
over 10 years). However, younger people are in more strife, because the cost
<br>
per course increased dramatically a few years ago. Now it's something on the
<br>
order of 5K+ per year for courses like medicine and law.
<br>
<p>We used to have free, meritocratic entry education here, which is fine by
<br>
me. This HECS system is kind of crappy in comparison. However, I'd still
<br>
support it over people having to pay for their degrees up front. Basically,
<br>
under that kind of system I would not have a degree.
