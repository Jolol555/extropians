<p>If those links are based on research at the U of W, their work was
<br>
disproven by my cousin Andrew's work last year, I believe. They now know
<br>
for a fact that the East Antarctic ice sheet has been stable over the
<br>
last 22 million years, ever since it first formed as that continent slid
<br>
into place at the pole, and has resisted far more significant changes in
<br>
temperature than what is predicted by the nuts at the UN. Moreover,
<br>
there are significant models that show that the while West sheet *may*
<br>
increase its sliding potential with warming, any amount of warming that
<br>
would cause that would also cause an increase in precipitation at the
<br>
pole, most of which would wind up on the East sheet, i.e. a more secure
<br>
location, which would counteract ANY increase in loss of above sea level
<br>
ice on the West sheet.
<br>
<p>Claims about the West sheet being undermined are also incredibly naive:
<br>
think about it for a minute: there are thousands of meters of ice above
<br>
sea level pressing down on the ice, displacing any water that occus
<br>
below it with thousands of pounds of pressure per square inch. Vostok's
<br>
water only exists because it is in a depression with noplace to go.
