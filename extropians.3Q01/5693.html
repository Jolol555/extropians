<p>Yes, but look at it from a utility sense: if an individual is not
<br>
especially driven to accomplish something in the world, they are instead
<br>
going to try to make the most of their intelligence with the least
<br>
effort (which is not a dumb strategy for getting through life, just not
<br>
very ambitious). Writing an advice column and inventing puzzlebooks
<br>
sound like they fit the bill. I slightly fit that bill - my excuse for
<br>
never finishing college for years has been that getting a union card for
<br>
its own sake doesn't motivate me, nor does curriculum requirements, that
<br>
I only want to learn stuff as it interests me. I'm smart enough that
<br>
I've always been able to quickly get up to speed on any occupation I've
<br>
pursued, no matter how much anyone thinks I wasn't 'qualified'. I lost a
<br>
lot of ambitions years ago, impressing or getting the approval of others
<br>
being at the top of the list (as if you couldn't tell that already). Its
<br>
not worth the exasperation trying to meet other people's expectations.
