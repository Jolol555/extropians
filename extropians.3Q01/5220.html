<p>How do you know what Heston thinks his creator is?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;rights based on birth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; He says nor implys any such thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I believe that we are again engaged in a great civil war, a cultural war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's about to hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heart.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>WHich says nothing about turning back history. It is about avoiding a
<br>
terrible possible future history.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The &quot;birthright&quot; he is refering to is the birth of our nation, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the right of free speech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His quote of Lincoln was referring to the birth of our nation and the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of free speech.  However, Heston said we are about to fight *another* such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war today when he said, &quot;Those words are true again.  I believe that we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again engaged in a great civil war, a cultural war....&quot;  This second war is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not referring to the first one.
</em><br>
<p>and?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;When he says that he that our problems are bigger than the gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;issue, he implies that the gun issue is at its core.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nonsense, he's saying there are more important issues than guns and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that he should be listed to for what he is saying, not because he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is the elected president of the NRA.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He clearly describes his realization of this bigger issue in terms of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being president of the NRA and being &quot;in the cross hairs of those who target
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that firearms are not the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Which still does not say that the gun issue is the core issue, merely
<br>
that he is a central core target of those who are hijacking the
<br>
constitution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; he's saying that if there is such a thing as black pride then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; white pride, red pride, is equally valid. He is correct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He is correct.  But he doesn't say all pride is equally valid.  He is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically arguing for the validity of white pride.  He singles it out and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implies that it needs to be bolstered up compared to the others.  He implies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that whites need more pride now while blacks and other races have enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pride.
</em><br>
<p>Well, why not? US civilization was not predominantely created by the
<br>
minds of africans, chinese, or native americans. Why not give credit
<br>
where credit is due?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, sometimes these groups do try to get special treatment laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; passed, hate crimes are an example. When someone who is gay refers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to themselves as gay they have drawn a distinction, it is equally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ok for anyone else to make that distinction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hate crime laws are not an example of gay rights.  They are racial laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which sometimes include sexual orientation or gender.  These laws give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentencing guidelines for criminals not rights to citizens.  Gay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equal-rights laws would be ones advocating marriage, cohabitation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insurance, joint tax returns, inheriting property, joint ownership of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property, etc.
</em><br>
<p>But they don't generally do this, they set sentencing guidlines for
<br>
those who exercise their own rights to not be forced into accepting
<br>
lifestyles they view as abhorrent. When these include proscriptions
<br>
against using words in speech which gays use as a matter of course in
<br>
their own intra-gay communications, then the line is crossed into
<br>
thought repression, equal protection, and first amendment violations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;When he spoke against the Axis Powers in World War II, and draws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;a parallel between the holocaust and what is currently happening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;to gun owners, he implies the holocaust was less than it was or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;that gun control equals Nazi atrocities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; He implies no such thing, he said &quot;But during a speech, when I drew
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an analogy between singling out innocent Jews and singling out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.&quot; He is arguing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; against singling out those who haven't done anything wrong, he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; talking about unreasoned prejudice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Give me a break.  He compares gun-owners' persecution to the Holocaust.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compares gun-control advocates to Nazis.  This is inflammatory hyperbole at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best.  I can't believe anyone would argue for the validity of this analogy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was a stupid PR blunder, period.
</em><br>
<p>Depends on what point in time you are referring to. Until Ashcroft made
<br>
his recent statement about individual rights recently, we were living in
<br>
a state somewhere between the beginning and end of 1938 when it comes to
<br>
gun rights in this country. I expect, Harvey, that you are rather
<br>
ignorant of the sort of civil rights violations that occur every day to
<br>
gun owners in this country, specifically because the media refuses to
<br>
report them, generally, except when they are able to present the gun
<br>
owner in the worst possible light. Police are generally ignoring due
<br>
process and even the letter of the gun control laws themselves in
<br>
persecuting gun owners who are exercising their rights. Innocent people
<br>
are having their homes raided by swat teams and having their property
<br>
destroyed, stolen, and confiscated by police on the simple hearsay of
<br>
one unsubstantiated allegation. Innocent, law abiding people who have
<br>
concealed weapons permits and are carrying their weapons in fanny packs
<br>
in accordance with state law are being arrested right and left in
<br>
Illinois, contrary to state law, by the supporters of one rogue
<br>
prosecutor and his henchmen. Tens of thousands of Californians are
<br>
living, illegally, in the posession of guns that were first registered,
<br>
and are now banned and confiscated. Registration and confiscation of
<br>
guns owned by jews was a precedent event to the Krystallnacht pogroms of
<br>
1938.
<br>
<p>Today millions of non-violent citizens are sitting in concentration
<br>
camps in the US simply for posessing a substance that is not poisonous,
<br>
and when they get out of prison will never be allowed to own guns again
<br>
in their lives. A large number of these are at risk of execution by HIV
<br>
while incarcerated. They don't need gas chambers or ovens here, they've
<br>
got a handy virus to do the work for them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;When he gives an example of dental patients who got AIDS from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;dentists who didn't disclose it, he implies that AIDS patients
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;must be publicly disclosed and kept away from the general public.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; He did not say anything about keeping them away, but he does feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their patients have a right to know. Shall we take a vote?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, but you make my point for me.  You think you know what he said, but read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it carefully.  He never said the patients have a right to know.  He merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implied it.  He said it was bad that they didn't know.  You are taking the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ball and running with it.  You are deriving conclusions from the speech that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were not explicitly spelled out as part of his agenda.  This is the exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of implications I was talking about.  I think you caught this one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because you agreed with it.  I think you would catch more of the other ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you were inclined to agree with them as well.
</em><br>
<p>Do you or do you not think that it is right for a person to not know
<br>
when their body tissues are being exposed to an HIV carrier under
<br>
conditions which have been proven to be communicable for the virus?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;When he points out that Dr. King said &quot;negroes&quot; but its not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;allowed now, he implies that we should be allowed classify people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;into another race by the color of their skin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He was specifically arguing against hyphenated terminology like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; African-American which refers to their geographical origin.  He was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically arguing for the terms &quot;black&quot; or &quot;negro&quot; which refers to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; color of their skin.  He wants to classify these people by the color of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their skin and not by their geographical origin.  It seems obvious from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words.
</em><br>
<p>Which is more accurate? I mean, if a white fellow who was born in South
<br>
Africa or Rhodesia immigrated to the US, does he or does he not have the
<br>
right to call himself an 'African-American'??? Does he then have the
<br>
right to apply for positions in college and employment that are
<br>
determined by the fact that he is 'African-American', to the exclusion
<br>
of other white fellows who were born here in the US, or who immigrated
<br>
from european nations? If he doesn't have this right, then please
<br>
explain why...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; COME ON NOW! How do you derive that from what he said! From now on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anyone referring to me as &quot;white&quot; is a racist. Now do you see?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree.  If someone didn't want to call people Scottish, British, Irish,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Swedish, but insisted that they all be called &quot;white&quot; because they look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alike, I think that would be racist.  It's more than just a passing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adjective.  Heston is actually arguing against one set of terminology and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for another.  This is not a statement out of context.  He is actually giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a speech to the NRA about their right to use the word &quot;negro&quot; instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;African-American&quot; because they prefer the term.
</em><br>
<p>When 'African' has no common cultural referent. Is an Egyptian arab a
<br>
semite or an african? Is a pygmy and his culture more 'african' than
<br>
that of bantus? There are actually four or five different 'races' in
<br>
africa who have lived there for hundreds if not thousands and even tens
<br>
of thousands of years. Which one then is authentically 'african'? How do
<br>
you decide?
<br>
<p>Since you've decided that 'white' is bad, what about 'european'? Who
<br>
decides what is 'European'? Do the Basques or Lithuanians, who have
<br>
little or no common cultural or linguistic connection to other european
<br>
cultures, get excluded or are they the default?
<br>
<p>The primary reason Heston abhors the term is the same reason he abhors
<br>
all 'hyphenated american' referents: they place one's cultural origin
<br>
ahead of one's status as an American citizen. In his eyes, citizenship
<br>
(and current cultural participation) is most paramount, and one's
<br>
origins are secondary. I entirely agree with him.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;When he claims to be a Native American because he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;blood-initiated into a tribe, he implies that we should discount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;any racism that native Americans see because he is one and doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;see any discrimination.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; He referred to this in a very brief discussion as to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; awkwardness of hyphenated names. Mr. Heston believes citizens of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this country are &quot;Americans&quot;, period.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then why does he want to distinguish between race, sex, or sexual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orientation then?  Why not call them all American?  They are all &quot;American&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when he doesn't want to recognize differences, but they are all different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups when he does want to recognize differences.  Likewise, he wants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom of speech for some topics, but then argues against freedom of speech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for certain songs, teachers or entertainers.
</em><br>
<p>Apples and oranges, Harvey. He hates rap because rap encourages violence
<br>
against police, against the state, and for war and bigotry against
<br>
whites in general. Rap IS racist, and therefore, should be treated at
<br>
least as much a 'hate crime' as anything said by the KKK. It should not
<br>
be celebrated by popular culture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;When he says one can talk about race without being a racist, he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;implies that he wants to talk about race and make decisions based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;on race.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No, he means what he said, I can refer to someone as black or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hispanic or white or anything else, imparting information without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; negatively discriminating.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Talking about race&quot; is more than just referencing someone.  He wants to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;recognize&quot; the difference, &quot;discuss&quot; the differences, and by implication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act on the differences.
</em><br>
<p>Discussion and action are completely different things, Harvey.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;When he says you can accept but not celebrate homosexuality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;without being a homophobe, he implies that we can accept that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;exists but we don't have to like it or even cooperate with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; He didn't say the second part but in this case  I think that's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pretty good implication based on the facts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, he didn't say it, but it sure is implied.  Why did you feel compelled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to agree that it's a pretty good implication based on the facts?  Because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is clear what the implication is, even if he doesn't say it.  Again, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that you would see more of the other implications if you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inclined to agree with them.  Or, let me ask this in a more leading way:  Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think a racist would read more of these implications into this speech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than you would?  I think the code-words and possible implications are there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for those who want to latch onto them.
</em><br>
<p>This 'code word' term is one more catch phrase of political correctness
<br>
police doing their typical hate baiting. And why is what he said wrong?
<br>
We are all entitled to our own values, we just are not entitled to act
<br>
on them all. We cannot be compelled to act contrary to our values (with
<br>
a few obvious exceptions required by citizenship).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;When he says disobedience is in our DNA and follows the awesome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;power of Gandhi, Thoreau, and Jesus, he implies a racial rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;and manifest destiny for certain groups.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For Indians, writers and a christian mystic?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No.  He said who he was addressing.  &quot;You are the best and the brightest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You, here in the fertile cradle of American academia, here in the castle of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning on the Charles River, you are the cream.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I imagine you mean that 'cream' is one more 'code word' for 'elite white
<br>
people'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You mean the part about the ICE-T song about murdering an innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cop? He was taking that position as a stockholder that it was wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the company to profit from such a thing, and he put his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reputation on the line to defend what he thought was right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly.  He argues for his right to use terms and say things that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't want him to say, but then he also brags that he got Ice-T's contract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cancelled because he didn't like the lyrics of a song.  I thought this was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconsistent.
</em><br>
<p>No, it's not. It was his money being invested in ICE-T's work, and it
<br>
was his right to express his displeasure at how his money was being
<br>
spent. By expressing his displeasure, he was able to illuminate other
<br>
stockholders as to how their own money was being invested, and they made
<br>
their own decisions. Pop music is not speech, it is commerce.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Heston's speech was about free speech, not the political correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; jargon that passes for free speech these days, period.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wish.  If he had argued for free speech for everybody, I would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreed.  But he seemed to criticize the speech of others as much as he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argued for his own right to speak.  I did not feel like he was arguing for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my right to speak on any issues I might speak out on.
</em><br>
<p>Only that rights have responsibilities. Misusing your responsibility
<br>
entails the risk of displeasure of your fellow citizens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I read this, I felt like Heston would classify me as one of the liberals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as one of the politically correct, as one of the non-Christians, or in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other way as one of the enemy in the &quot;cultural war&quot; or second &quot;civil war&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he is fighting.  I certainly did not feel that he was arguing for my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights.  In fact, I got the distinct impression that he was against gay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights, women's rights, blacks rights, native American rights and many other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights for groups that were somehow different than his own.  In fact, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only rights he specifically supported seemed to be for white, males in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. who shared a birthright of revolution.  This was not an inclusive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speech.
</em><br>
<p>He was promoting the fact that most of western civilization was created
<br>
by whites, and white males generally. Emphasizing one does not mean
<br>
being opposed to the other.
