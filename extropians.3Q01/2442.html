<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you mean by &quot;contravene&quot;?  He simply wrote papers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; produced a program to back up his papers on how broken the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; protection schemes are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Actually, it is not quite so simple.  Dmitry Sklyarov works for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Russian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; company called ElcomSoft Co. Ltd. of Moscow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://ElcomSoft.com">http://ElcomSoft.com</a>&gt;.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They sell commercial software that recovers passwords or breaks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encryption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;<a href="http://ElcomSoft.com/prs.html">http://ElcomSoft.com/prs.html</a>&gt;.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Pardon me, but this has nothing to do with the charges against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him.  Many of those pasword cracking products are bought  by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;law enforcement&quot; organizations like the self-same FBI that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nabbed him and refuses to release him even after Adobe dropped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their complaint and asked that he be released.
</em><br>
<p>I was not addressing or supporting the charges against him.  I was
<br>
responding to your oversimplification that he &quot;simply wrote papers and
<br>
produced a program to back up his papers&quot;.  I was pointing out that he went
<br>
a little farther than just academic research.
<br>
<p>As a side note, Adobe has no right to drop charges against Sklyarov.  This
<br>
is not a civil suit.  It is a criminal case.  The FBI/police/government
<br>
decides on their prosecution strategy.  The so-called victim (Adobe) has no
<br>
rights.  This is what allows the government to pursue victimless crimes
<br>
where none of the participants wants the government to intervene, but they
<br>
do anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we have a beef with the company he works for in general then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we should take that up with the company instead of locking away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of its employees on trumped up charges.
</em><br>
<p>The so-called beef is a law which makes it illegal to break encryption.  It
<br>
may be a bad law.  However, as it is written, it is Sklyarov who broke the
<br>
encryption.  The company that employs him and distributes his program did
<br>
not break this law.
<br>
<p>I agree that the law is stupid.  I myself break these kind of laws all the
<br>
time in the course of my security business.  I never get arrested because
<br>
nobody cares.  I am hired by clients who pay me to break their security.
<br>
Although he law does not exemptions for me, most prosecutors ignore me.
<br>
They selectively enforce the law.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lastly, do not call people who do cyber breaking and enterning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;hackers&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry.  I agree with your implied point that hacking is not necessarily
<br>
related to criminal behavior.  Running a tool downloaded from the Internet
<br>
is not really hacking in any sense of the word.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This &quot;encryption&quot; is so asinine and childish that a 12 year old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could break it without hardly trying.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  That is why they need laws to prevent people from doing it.  The
<br>
encryption itself is not good enough to deter anybody.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is also offered in conformance with &quot;fair use&quot; which Adobe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e-books and other closed systems today would deny by enforcing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different set of common law in the code itself which everyone is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then forbiddent to reverse-engineer or contravene.  This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huge threat to all of us.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure this blocks fair use.  People still must pay for books.  When
<br>
you borrow a book from a library for free, it is because the library paid
<br>
for it.  Adobe is trying to develop a method to ensure payment.  I'm not
<br>
sure I see how enforcing payment threatens fair use of copyrighted
<br>
materials.  I am probably missing your point as to what is threatening about
<br>
this technology.
<br>
<p>Are you arguing against the concept of copyrights in general?  That is a
<br>
complicated topic, about which I have still not finalized my position.  I
<br>
hate the idea of patents which limit the use of a great idea.  However, I
<br>
can't see how inventors would get paid without them.  The same is true for
<br>
copyrights.  I hate the idea that a freely-copyable resource is artificially
<br>
limited, but I don't know how artists and writers would get paid without
<br>
enforcing payment.  I admit that I have not researched this enough, and
<br>
therefore I am not sure what the best answer should be.
