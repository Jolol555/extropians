<em>&gt;How Hot Is It In Hell?

<em>&gt;                       (a true story)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A thermodynamics professor had written a take home exam for his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;graduate students. It had one question:  &quot;Is Hell exothermic (gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?  Support your answer with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proof.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some variant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One student, however, wrote the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time.  So,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they are leaving.  I think that we can safely assume that once a soul
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gets to Hell, it will not leave.  Therefore, no souls are leaving.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and all souls go to Hell.  With birth and death rates as they are, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;added. This gives two possibilities:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1). If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;until all Hell breaks loose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2). Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hell freezes over.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                       So which is it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan during my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Freshman year, &quot;That it will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you,&quot;  and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in having sexual relations with her, then #2 cannot be true, and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hell is exothermic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                       The student got the only A.
