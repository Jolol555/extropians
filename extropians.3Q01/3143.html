<p><em>&gt;&gt; You cannot suppose that your own ideological allies don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; behave the same.  Moreover, it doesn't really matter if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; egg each other on or not.  What matter are the tone of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; discussion and the logic of the arguments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When you get sent 1200 emails in the space of three days filled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with inane comments and bald insults, they are not playing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quality game, but a quantity game - it's called 'overwhelm'.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, I'll take your word for it that this really happened either
<br>
on extropians or on some other list.  It should be condemned in
<br>
either case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Their nature seems to be to pigeonhole everyone who does not agree with them in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every particular as either hopelessly dense, a clueless dupe or a bright but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; malevolent ringer (see my posts on the structure of extremism, to which they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; took immediate and vociferous offence, even though they were not named in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them).
</em><br>
<p>Did you know that I am now in an online conversation with someone
<br>
on this very list who believes that *I* am in that category?  That
<br>
I am either pretending to be obtuse, or am just trying to bait
<br>
people?!  You are so right.  It is their nature.  I would like to
<br>
see your posts on the structure of extremism.  Frankly, given
<br>
the rather lurid and extreme nature of what you wrote the other
<br>
day, I'll very much want to see that.  :-)
<br>
<p>Again, you wrote
<br>
<em>&gt; Their nature seems to be to pigeonhole everyone who does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree with them in every particular as either hopelessly dense,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a clueless dupe or a bright but malevolent ringer.
</em><br>
<p>What if they have no choice?  That is, what if you are so right
<br>
about it being &quot;their nature&quot;, that they simply *cannot* consider
<br>
the possibility that their ideological adversaries are sincere?
<br>
This indeed could be a form of mild paranoia; I think that some
<br>
conspiracy theorists are afflicted with something similar.  But
<br>
remember:  (and perhaps you have to practice saying it over and
<br>
over to yourself, as I implied in the thread &quot;Letting the voice
<br>
of reason into your life&quot;, a phrase partly due to J. R. Molloy),
<br>
<p>&quot;Intemperate and intolerant behavior, including extreme vindictiveness,
<br>
afflicts some people of *each* political persuasion, including my own.&quot;
<br>
<p>Presumably, saying this to oneself (not that you, personally, haven't
<br>
already done so), will then allow the further damning thought:
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes.  We progressives have among our ranks many
<br>
wholly intolerant and almost irrational partisans.&quot;
<br>
<p>(This last sentence will be too much without careful practice of the
<br>
former, I believe.)  These days I can say, without flinching a bit,
<br>
<p>Yes.  We conservative-libertarians have among our ranks
<br>
many wholly intolerant and almost irrational partisans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Anyway, name-calling unsupported by argument needs to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; dropped from everyone's behavior.  But again, isn't it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; objectively true that there are quite a number of posters
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with collectivist and socialist leanings?  Naturally, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; should make clear at least in context what one means by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; such terms; here I mean...
</em><br>
<p>&quot;collectivist&quot;,
<br>
&quot;socialist&quot;,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Do you consider those just insult words?  For example, calling anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a &quot;fascist&quot; or a &quot;racist&quot; on this list is quite wrong and is name-calling,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; unless you back it up awfully well.  This is true because not a soul
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; admits to such a description!  But if you do as I have done, to wit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (in reverse) by, e.g., saying that some people have made racist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; statements, then it of course has to be demonstrated by quoting the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; precise source.  So do you think that &quot;socialist&quot; and &quot;collectivist&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; as adjectives are often misapplied?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that they are the intended moral equivalent, to those who use them, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of employing racial and/or ethnic slurs, just as nazi name-calling is.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm not fully decided.  It's a rather difficult question.  You
<br>
see, what if you have truly identified a partial tendency towards
<br>
(socialism | racism)?   Then you are saying only what you believe to
<br>
be factually true about the essay or person.  Then what is one to do?
<br>
So it's not so simple to demote &quot;socialist&quot; or &quot;racist&quot; to a slur,
<br>
unless, as I said, these terms are used unsupported by argument.
<br>
<p>Lee
