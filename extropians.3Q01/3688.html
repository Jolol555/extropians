<em>&gt; &gt;Hmm. How is a contact lense any different from a screwdriver?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Both are tools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that augment the human body to make certain things easier. Are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggesting that all tool-users are transhuman? So any attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improve our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abilities through constructs of matter makes us transhuman for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the duration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of that attempt?&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reason, be reasonable -:)
</em><br>
<p>One of the advantages of the name is that I am by definition even when I am
<br>
not :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you are a transhuman by some other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more advanced technology, a chip in your brain that gives you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more processing power, then the out-dated contact lens would not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep you from being a transhuman just because it is antiquated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hope this is clear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, with that said, tool-users are folks who use tools. As for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the great leap in your thinking -- &quot;... makes us transhuman for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the duration of that attempt?...&quot;  Well this depends.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have one robotic leg, a brain enhancer for processing power, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a robotic eye that can see through walls one year and then three
</em><br>
<em>&gt; days later you have an entirely new body that is engineered with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnology and AI, yes you would be a transhuman is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transition.  BUT, if you use a hammer one day and a screwdriver
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to tighten the valves on your car the next day, and *then* have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spanking new upgraded nano-driven body on the third day, I'd have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say that you have been a transhuman for only that day my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend.  But, this is only my view.
</em><br>
<p>Which would seem to be the common sense view, agreed. What I was getting at
<br>
in my last post was a query on where exactly the line is drawn. Or more to
<br>
the point, what is the rationale for drawing the line where you have drawn
<br>
it? It's hard to defend a definition without considering its boundaries and
<br>
offering explanations as to why X is in but Y is out.
<br>
<p>In the case above, why is a nano-driven body any different from a hammer?
<br>
They are both tools. They both augment/change/extend your natural abilities.
<br>
You could stop using either one of them and go back to what you were before.
<br>
You have already argued -- if I understood you correctly -- that &quot;high
<br>
technology&quot; is not a suitable quality to define a transhuman by
<br>
augmentation; i.e. a contact lense right now makes you (slightly)
<br>
transhuman, a (currently vaporware) chip in the brain makes you (a little
<br>
more) transhuman.
<br>
<p>So what, in your opinion, are the categorizations beyond mere common sense
<br>
that define where human stops and transhuman picks up. I'm curious and I
<br>
don't have a hard and fast answer myself. Or is this art, you'll know it if
<br>
you see it?
