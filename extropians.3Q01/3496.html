<p>I've been preparing a spreadsheet with one column showing various black
<br>
people, such as those I know personally, actors, public figures, etc,
<br>
and other columns with skin tone (dark/light), facial structure, age,
<br>
manner of speech, dress, etc, then the amount of 'suspicion' I feel
<br>
toward the specific person. This is an attempt to understand any
<br>
racist/sexist feelings I have. It's an interesting exercise, and I'm
<br>
sure some people would think it racist to even attempt such a thing.
<br>
While I don't have any conclusions yet, skin tone seems to me to *not*
<br>
be a major factor in this (highly personal) assessment. If anything,
<br>
facial structure (especially combined with an age range of 15-30) beats
<br>
out skin tone easily, and both figure much less than manner of speech,
<br>
age, or dress. I imagine we've all heard about discrimination being
<br>
about skin color but I have doubts if skin color alone is the primary
<br>
reason for discrimination against blacks. Perhaps it's just the most
<br>
obvious.
<br>
<p>It wasn't until I got my first computer job that I met people on a
<br>
regular basis who I regarded as intelligent as I was. I'm no
<br>
super-genius, but have seen high school test scores that (somehow) gave
<br>
me an IQ of a little over 140. I think most smart people agree that they
<br>
don't regard themselves as smart so much as they regard most other
<br>
people as stupid. I can imagine a black person thinking I'm
<br>
discriminating because of his or her skin color but unless they
<br>
challenge me intellectually I may ignore or dismiss them, just as I
<br>
might dismiss most other stupid people, regardless of race.
