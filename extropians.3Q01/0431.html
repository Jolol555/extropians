<em>&gt;      &gt;Why would an  android have to go to talk to &quot;Dr. Know&quot; like he did?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Surely he would  be able to, if he didn't already have it - purchase

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfair! If you know how to depict that on screen in a visually interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner then you're in the wrong line of work, you should be making movies.
</em><br>
<p>Also, &quot;purchase&quot; implies &quot;money&quot;, and I'm kind of surprised David had _any_
<br>
money.  He didn't have much.
<br>
<p>Joe should have had more... of course, Joe was on the run from the law.  Bad
<br>
time to use your credit chip.
<br>
<p>And even though Joe knew way more about the world than David did, he still
<br>
seemed oddly naive at times, by human standards.
<br>
<p>But this is a pretty subtle point of knowledge economics to be arguing about.
<br>
Compare to:
<br>
<p>David is vulnerable to spinach, but not saltwater.
<br>
David and Joe can sort of fly an amphibicopter -- okay, maybe the UI's a lot
<br>
better than modern helicopters.
<br>
We won't ask how the amphibicopter was moving, or why the police would have
<br>
one... general progress of cool tech for the latter, I guess.  &quot;Antigravity&quot;
<br>
for the former?  Eh.
<br>
The space-time soul thing.  Let's not talk about that.  Especially about it
<br>
only lasting for a day.  Please let's not talk about that!
<br>
<p>And, what got me: what is their _power_ source?  When the voiceover first
<br>
saiad &quot;oceans freezing&quot; I was thinking &quot;antimatter slivers&quot;.  Then we find
<br>
it's only 2000 years, so I could believe plutonium or some other radioactive
<br>
-- he seemed weak when he was rescued.
<br>
<p>But whatever his power source is, they put it in the _teddy bear_.  Talk about
<br>
free energy!  And they can't zap a few glaciers?
<br>
<p>I liked the movie, BTW.  I just think there are bigger flaws to pick at.
