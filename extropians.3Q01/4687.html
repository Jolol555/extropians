<em>&gt; &gt; I think the material world is inherently neutral, which in some ways is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; almost as bad as active hostility.  I think that a lot of the problem 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be ameliorated by putting at least one layer of abstraction between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; yourself and physical reality.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I had been supposing that there already were levels of implementation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(or abstraction) between me and the physical world.  I see my body
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as just a device that allows my actual living to take place;  that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;why I look forward to an upgrade to distributed hardware.
</em><br>
<p>There is definitely a &quot;level of abstraction&quot; between you and the real world. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our senses, as well as they enable are ambling through physical space, 
<br>
only relate to our minds a poor semblance of what is really going on &quot;out 
<br>
there.&quot;  There are sound and light wave frequencies well above (and below) 
<br>
what we detect.  There are things so large and so small that we cannot hope 
<br>
to ever see them.  Not to mention the fact that, compared with say a 
<br>
bloodhound's, our sense of smell is almost useless.
<br>
<p>This is one of the main reasons we continually find that the world does not 
<br>
operate as our &quot;common sense&quot; would expect.  The level of abstraction is so 
<br>
great that we can only figure out how the world really works by 
<br>
interpolating through the code of mathematics.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
