Peter C. McCluskey writes

<p><em>&gt;&gt; Yes, there are a certain, though limited number of examples where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fitness is improved by false belief.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe there is a wide variety of questions for which the benefits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of thinking in ways that your acquaintances are comfortable with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exceed[s] the benefits of searching for the truth.
</em><br>
<p>That's true, but I observe that you have changed &quot;fitness&quot; to benefit.
<br>
It is of great benefit to me to know the truth, for its own sake.
<br>
*Benefit* is often defined according to one's own value system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; [The idea of moving closer to those you disagree with] would only work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; if you had some confidence or faith in those who liked the other candidate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; As an example, suppose that you do not believe in God, but wish to be as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; truth-seeking as possible.  It does not follow that you should &quot;move your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; beliefs in the direction f beliefs favored&quot; by those who are religious. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe it normally does follow that you should do so (i.e. increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your estimate of the probability that God exists).
</em><br>
<p>There are some issues about which I would agree with you:  if more people
<br>
came to believe that JFK was the victim of a conspiracy, or if more began
<br>
to believe that it was hazardous to use airplanes, or if more people came
<br>
to doubt the Many-Worlds interpretation, then I might be swayed.
<br>
<p>But on other issues, I wouldn't be swayed (and on many issues, neither
<br>
would you).  For me, it wouldn't matter whether ten people believe in
<br>
UFOs or ten million do:  my total &quot;web of belief&quot; about the supposed
<br>
reality of UFOs together with my beliefs about how gullible people are
<br>
concerning these issues that the skeptics routinely discuss, preclude
<br>
me from being influenced.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; You may have concluded that they are simply out to lunch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for some reason (explanation).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Concluded that you can be certain they are &quot;out to lunch&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Or merely that they probably are?
</em><br>
<p>That they certainly are (with the usual proviso that we can be absolutely
<br>
certain of nothing).  I think that people who believe that the moon walk
<br>
of the NASA astronauts was a hoax are certainly wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you mean probably, then Robin's analysis appears to imply that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should believe there is some chance that they know something you don't,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and adjust your beliefs to acount for this chance.
</em><br>
<p>No.  There is no chance (to me) that the people who believe the landing
<br>
on the moon was a hoax, know anything that I don't.  Quite the opposite.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you are truly certain, then I would be very interested how you acquired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this certainty.  Not just that many of them are &quot;out to lunch&quot;, but that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best are.
</em><br>
<p>It's very difficult to explain.  One's understanding of the world arises
<br>
from a vast, vast number of impressions.  According to pan-critical rationalism,
<br>
which I also believe, most of one's beliefs have in essense &quot;stood the test
<br>
of time&quot;.  For example, my disbelief in flying saucers has been sustained 
<br>
through a number of arguments with believers, and through many accounts of
<br>
such arguments (e.g., in the Skeptical Inquirer).  Sorry, but it's impossible
<br>
for me to account at present for exactly why I am more certain that the
<br>
moon landing was real, than I am, for example, that Harvey Oswald was the
<br>
lone assassin in the JFK case, both of which I believe to be true.
<br>
