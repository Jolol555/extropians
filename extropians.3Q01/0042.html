<p><em>&gt; I think you Americans have no monopoly on silliness - it is

</em><br>
<p>I must hasten to explain, said Lee modestly, that we Americans
<br>
do not have an innate talent at being silly.  Our formidable
<br>
skill arose, as so many things do, from a great deal of practice.
<br>
<p>More seriously, Mike Lorrey writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I consider the issues at the basis of european extremism to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather simple, while their solutions are hilariously ludicrous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American examples of extremism (slavery, civil rights, taxation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without representation, the desire to not live under the threat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of nuclear annihilation, the desire to not live in a police state)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are all rather profound issues of the human condition.
</em><br>
<p>Those don't sound extreme to me; but perhaps that's your point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You'd have to LIKE living like a lemming in a fishbowl in a house
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full of hungry cats to enjoy the sort of extremism that occurs in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europe.  I'm sure that such is just fine for some people, but we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are over here specifically because we DONT like it.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, your being born here may have had more to do with it :-)
<br>
Also, as all the do-gooders used to say about U.S. and Soviet 
<br>
tendencies, &quot;they are becoming more like us, and we are becoming
<br>
more like them&quot;, a prospect I'm sure that you dread.
<br>
<p>Amara adds
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; So there is something going on. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Europe is made of many many very different cultures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your subject line reveals your bias, Lee.
</em><br>
<p>I can only infer from this that you believe that the fanaticism
<br>
exhibited historically by Germany, Italy, Russia, France (in the 
<br>
revolution) and Yugoslavia (recently) have no common denominator.
<br>
I suspect that they do; or rather, that there is an explanation
<br>
as to why America has been spared.  Further, I still think that
<br>
the Americans were fanatical about waging World War II (commendably
<br>
so, I should say), and are equally fanatical about anti-smoking,
<br>
and that possibly there is a common denominator (maybe Puritanism,
<br>
as Mitch and Tiberius suggested).
