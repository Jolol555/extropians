<p><em>&gt; I must agree with Greg's assessment wholeheartedly.  This is certainly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best live speech I have heard in my lifetime, and I depending on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcome of the next few years, it will likely stand as one of the best in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably was...but I don't think that anyone can fake sincerity to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree that Bush displayed.
</em><br>
<p>My opinion is that someone else probably did write the speech (but that's
<br>
neither here nor there).  Faking sincerity is another matter altogether -
<br>
while I don't think Bush faked his sincerity, either, I don't think
<br>
sincerity is all it's cut out to be.  (You know, as when someone sincerely
<br>
believes he's Napoleon - but isn't; or, when Ronald Reagan  sincerely
<br>
believed he was in some movie from the past - when in fact he was not).
<br>
Maybe I'm talking more about &quot;belief,&quot; and the sincerity that comes from
<br>
having a particular belief.  In Bush's case, maybe his sincerity comes from
<br>
his belief in the &quot;God&quot; he so profusely mentioned at the end of his speech.
<br>
As much as I may have liked parts of Bush's speech (and for the most part, I
<br>
thought it was good - kudos to the speechwriter(s)), I thought it was
<br>
intellectually compromised as soon as &quot;God&quot; was brought into the equation.
<br>
<p>Luckily, Bush's &quot;God&quot; has somewhat more wiggle room (surely debatable, but
<br>
let's leave it at that for now) than bin Laden's &quot;Allah&quot; (and did you see
<br>
those Taliban clerics poring over holy books to look for solutions to their
<br>
political dilemma?) ... but Bush's sincerity may have been inspired more
<br>
from his Christianity than from our secular form of government (also
<br>
debatable, but let's leave it at that for now, too).   Of course I'm being
<br>
simplistic - and churlish - but as a nontheist I've just been so tired of
<br>
listening to all the irrationality and emotionality around the subject of
<br>
&quot;God,&quot; and all the calls to grovel, pray and to bow heads.  Patriotism is
<br>
not synonymous with religiosity, but it's certainly seemed like that's been
<br>
the message lately, more than ever.
<br>
<p>Looking for solutions from the root cause of the problem is nuts, in my
<br>
opinion.  The Taliban do it.  We, supposedly, don't do it?
<br>
<p>So, why does the U.S. feel the need to lower itself by invoking God into so
<br>
many important situations (and speeches)?  Would Bush's speech have been any
<br>
worse if &quot;God Bless America&quot;-type sentiments weren't written in?  In my
<br>
opinion, as soon as &quot;God&quot; is mentioned in the political arena, the debate
<br>
stoops to &quot;my Non-Existent Being can beat up your Non-Existent Being.&quot;
