<em>&gt; &gt; Please humor me and my ignorance of the details involved, I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ask a lot of questions in trying to understand the situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's really neat when someone is able to write such a statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with total sincerity and no sarcasm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, they live in kleptocracies. But they suffer the abuses, instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; benefitting from them. Given that, I can't imagine why would they feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inclined to create a kleptocracy in the US. They may lack a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sophisticated political ideas and practice, but they should be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recognize kleptocracy is a no win game for them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that despite the annoyances with the unfamiliar, many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immigrants do appreciate the improvements in the new country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they've chosen in contrast to the old country.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitely not the case that there would be an *intention*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to create corruption or devalue the institutions of liberty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is of concern is that such eventualities stem from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic culture of a people.  For example, what if the particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of religiosity of a people have a great influence on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns of government that develop?  Libertarians systematically,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the way, do not appreciate the hundreds of years that it took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (mostly) English speaking people to evolve democratic traditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the habits that support them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I do not agree that people are determined by their &quot;basic
<br>
culture&quot;. I believe in individuality and the role of individual
<br>
thinking much too much for that.  Cultural determinism isn't
<br>
much better than racial determinism in my book.
