Subject: Fwd: A.I. (the movie)

<p><em>&gt; It's a big story, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the movie suffers from some disjointedness as a result.  The three
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acts should narratively have been separated by large amounts of time,
</em><br>
<p>I got back from seeing it in Milpitas. They're rolling previews of Harry
<br>
Potter and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; beforehand, so that's a draw as well. My
<br>
companion said that they got the Dark Lord's riders right.
<br>
<p>The transition didn't bother me, as I took it to be a switch from
<br>
Spielberg to Kubrick. I'm not sure how'd you get David to wander in
<br>
woods for fifty years or so without running into other mechas. [1]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Gigolo Joe is entertaining in his own right;  I only wish it'd been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Geisha
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Geege or something instead...
</em><br>
<p>If you accept the idea that Spielberg's going to make some nods to
<br>
Kubrick's movies, then Gigolo Joe is Alex from &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.
<br>
Watching him dance down the street to his internal soundtrack, spashing
<br>
in the gutter with Gene Kelly's footwork, brings the 'ultraviolence'
<br>
back to mind, even if Joe's a dildo, not a war club.
<br>
<p>I think Spielberg did something interesting in the second act as well,
<br>
playing a game with how the mechas behaved, and how we interpret those
<br>
behaviors. The damaged nannybot, strapped to the demolition machine in
<br>
the &quot;Celebration of Life&quot; is smiling beautificaly at David. My first
<br>
reaction is that she's taking her impending martyrdom with grace. But
<br>
then when you think about the nannybot's programming. She's behaving in
<br>
a calm, reassuring fashion because that's that you'd want a nanny to do
<br>
in order to keep her charges calm in a crowd of loud, violent people.
<br>
But I first saw it as if she was Joan of Arc at the stake.
<br>
<p>Dr. Know is like that to a lesser extent. He appears to be a capricious
<br>
genie (wish carefully) when he's behaving like a pay-as-you-go search
<br>
engine might. [2]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The &quot;framework&quot; of the last act is fascinating, though the execution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems like an exercise in wrap-up.
</em><br>
<p>He was able to create some set pieces that stayed with you. I haven't
<br>
seen that since &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; where we get to see the bombing of
<br>
Hiroshima reflected across the Sea of Japan by clouds.
<br>
<p>Again, compare the recreated house to the &quot;Hotel Room at the End of the
<br>
Universe &quot; from &quot;2001&quot;.
<br>
<p>Thinking of _The Difference Engine_, the opening of the last act reminds
<br>
me of the closing scene in the latter, where all that is left is the
<br>
machine world. (Ah, we worked Eirikur into the thread.) It's chilling,
<br>
yet it's hopeful. While the end of the _The Difference Engine_ is
<br>
chilling. [3]
<br>
<p>I agree with Jeff's assessment, go see the movie.
<br>
<p>[1] Apropos of nothing, there is detritus from an OSX dock 'poof' on my
<br>
screen obscuring part of it. I just woke my iBook from sleep, and the
<br>
poof residue is still on the screen. An interesting bug.
<br>
[2] Clay, the people of the future have that micropayment thing worked
<br>
out!
<br>
[3] Unless you're Hans Moravec. Also, the mechanics of resurrection
<br>
reminded me of A.A. Attansno's _The Last Legends of Earth_, another big,
<br>
sprawling mess that's worth reading.
