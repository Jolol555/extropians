<p>Is this 2001, or are we still partying like it's 1899?   &quot;All those
<br>
Mexicans&quot; ...?  Forgive me, but are you being facetious or supercilious or
<br>
what ...?  (Or maybe you're in a &quot;wink-wink&quot; mood - as in:  let's ruffle a
<br>
few of those politically correct whiny liberals' feathers?)
<br>
<p>A few weeks ago Natasha posted &quot;I explain this by referencing other
<br>
technologies such as the telephone, television, computers and cell phones.
<br>
At first, only those with money or connections had them.  Today, in downtown
<br>
Los Angeles, there are more Mexicans using cell phones than executives.&quot;
<br>
<p>What are all these insinuations about &quot;Mexicans&quot;?
<br>
<p>And -- perhaps this is even more important -- what is the way you talk about
<br>
a group of people say about you?  This does not portend well for the future
<br>
if you guys are going to be in it, IMHO.
