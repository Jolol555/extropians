<em>&gt; the results of these lawsuits didn't they.? Wasn't the civil rights movement

<p>And did the civil rights movement get subsidized by the federal

government? No, it didn't. The civil rights movement was populated by
<br>
many libertarians (like Charlton Heston) who later vacated when it was
<br>
taken over by socialists demanding government subsidies and set-asides,
<br>
quotas and lower standards for minorities. All of the actions you
<br>
describe above were PRIVATE actions by PRIVATE citizens against
<br>
oppressive states. You didn't say anything to my own point above, BTW.
