If the essence of you can be not only preserved but uploaded and
<br>
partially or wholly downloaded into other bodies then this is
<br>
very
<br>
much like the notion of a &quot;soul&quot; that inhabits this body and
<br>
that
<br>
can survive the end of this body.  It is a technological means
<br>
by
<br>
which this old dream/vision/wish can be made real.  
<br>
<p>As Google is not in the least omniscient or even sentient I fail
<br>
to see that this joke is applicable.  I am talking about a very
<br>
different and far less bogus parallel that I find interesting.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As den Otter once said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The undefinable is the undefinable, the universe is the universe,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Google, a Sysop is a Sysop, an SI is an SI, and uploading is uploading.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So what?  We do not know the full implications of Sysop, SI or
<br>
uploading.  So it is premature to say that all the yearning
<br>
toward transcendence and thinking about what that might be like
<br>
before us was simply mistaken and a waste and has nothing of any
<br>
importance or relevance in it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I tend to be confident about my ability to handle what goes on in my head,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I don't mess with social group polarization, I don't mess with
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't mess with religious analogies.  I tend to regard these things as the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I tend to regard disowning hard questions using absurd analogies
<br>
as the equivalent of sticking your head in the oven and lighting
<br>
a match. &lt;g&gt;
