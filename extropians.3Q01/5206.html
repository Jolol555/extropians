</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than a concept of what it means to be a human.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not comfortable with this philosophical approach of seeking to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear to me that this is the right level of abstraction to advance our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding.
</em><br>
<p>This is of course an important question. I think many philosophical (and
<br>
other) discussions tend to get derailed by looking at problems at the
<br>
wrong level (e.g. trying to demonstrate free will by talking about
<br>
quantum mechanics, or explain individual behavior from large scale
<br>
social trends). But when talking about how to live one's life, it seems
<br>
that the natural level to discuss the person is both at the level of
<br>
universal human traits, and at the individual person's specific being.
<br>
If we were to discuss (say) the purpose of society or the nature of
<br>
emotions, other levels of description would be more relevant.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Putting it bluntly, I don't see that my highest goal in life should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily be the advancement of reason, simply because that trait
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens to distinguish humanity from apekind.  I feel under no obligation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to exaggerate my differences from the apes and to preferentially develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those traits that distinguish me from them.  It may be that I want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop my reasoning abilities, but it's not because of any deficiencies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the part of apes!
</em><br>
<p>I understand your objection, but I think you misunderstood Aristotele's
<br>
position. He did not say that the only true happiness is the development
<br>
of one's reason. Rather, you become happy by employing reason. Sure, one
<br>
way of applying reason is to extend it, and this is often very rewarding
<br>
(at least to philosophical people), but there are many other
<br>
possibilities. My impression of Aristotele is that he was a rather
<br>
pluralist person, not claiming there existed a specific lifestyle that
<br>
was the best possible and that everybody ought to pursue (which sounds
<br>
more platonist), but rather that there exists a broad direction of life
<br>
where happiness is maximized.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If there were other species around that were also intelligent, would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we then say that humanity's purpose was no longer the advancement of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality, but rather, perhaps, the advancement of singing ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (supposing the other intelligent species didn't sing)?
</em><br>
<p>In this case Aristotele would likely have said that the distinguishing
<br>
trait of intelligent beings is reason, and for flourishing it would have
<br>
to be exerted. In humans there would have been an unique way of exerting
<br>
it through singing, which would have been a way for humans to express
<br>
their unique nature, just as the intelligent dolphins might have
<br>
expressed theirs through ultrasound artworks. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; This all smacks of an argument from intelligent design, that each organism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was created with a place and purpose in the world, and we have to discover
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that purpose.  By that argument it's logical to look at how you differ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from other organisms in order to learn what the purpose was which you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were put here to fulfill.  But with a truer understanding of the nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of life, we know that there is no such purpose.  Comparing ourselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with other species does not tell us how we should live.
</em><br>
<p>I think Aristotele quite often fell for this kind of argument (just look
<br>
at his theory of causes), but that doesn't mean a neo-aristotelian
<br>
reading of him has to. Instead of thinking in terms of purposes of
<br>
human life, we can ask: what kinds of life *works*? What results do they
<br>
produce? Which of these results were the intended? Which make people
<br>
happy?
<br>
<p>Clearly these depends on human nature (if we had a completely different
<br>
motivational system different things and ways of living would make us
<br>
happy - or happiness by any definition might not even exist) and how
<br>
this nature works relative to other humans and the surrounding universe.
<br>
There doesn't have to be any inherent general purpose for humans for
<br>
humans to be able to create purposes for themselves.
