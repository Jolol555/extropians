<em>&gt; &gt; Because of specialization, of course. You don't train people to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chemists when they are going to pound nails all their lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So it's genetic? Some people are natural born chemists and others are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; congenitally predisposed to pound nails all their lives? Or does the quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of education have something to do with the proportion of people who become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemists, etc.?
</em><br>
<p>Most of the countries that score higher than US kids on tests do so
<br>
specifically because they have a multi-tiered school system that weeds
<br>
kids out around the 6th or 7th grade, sending the achievers to
<br>
university prep high schools, and those that don't to vocational high
<br>
schools. The kids that take these comparison tests are only from the
<br>
university prep high schools, not the vocational ones, which is why they
<br>
score so high.
<br>
<p>NOTE: Just because a kid goes to a vocational school doesn't mean they
<br>
don't take courses in subjects that would be considered part of a
<br>
'classical liberal' education. They take core competency courses just as
<br>
prep school kids do, they just take vocational classes as well, instead
<br>
of taking four years of science and four years of math, they take a
<br>
couple years of each and the rest in vocational classes to learn
<br>
marketable skills.
<br>
<p>This is one of the big problems. Teachers work to eliminate vocational
<br>
training because of career elitism, they don't want to be seen as
<br>
'vo-tech' teachers. No teacher is less respected than the shop teacher.
<br>
He is usually seen as a bumbling hick who spends his off hours coaching
<br>
the football team.
