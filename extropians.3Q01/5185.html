<em>&gt;&gt; Lets see, your comparing Heston to Clinton, a drug dealer, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a prostitute. I think I know political propaganda when I hear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;it.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;You are projecting your conservative biases onto me.  I don't lump
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Clinton, drugs and sex together in a single continuum of liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sin.  I thought I was giving unrelated examples of &quot;plausible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deniability&quot;, where the speaker dances around a topic without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;specifically admitting anything.  They all believe in their cause,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but don't want to admit it publicly to the authorities.
</em><br>
<p>You were inferring by comparison that Mr Heston is less than honest
<br>
and forthright. I don't have conservative biases, remember my
<br>
results from the worlds shortest political quiz? I'm a liberal.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;When he says his Creator gave him a gift which might be used in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;the political process, he implies that God will guide him to run
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;for president and guide his decisions while he is president.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; He never says any such thing in this speech. Retraction please.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;If my Creator gave me the gift to connect you with the hearts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minds of those great men, then I want to use that same gift now to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reconnect you with your own sense of liberty of your own freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of thought ... your own compass for what is right.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>He doesn't say anything about being president, those are your
<br>
words. You are putting words in his mouth and attempting to erect
<br>
a strawman. 
<br>
<p>Have some fire strawman....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;When he says we are fighting a great civil war and cultural war
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;that is trying to hijack our birthright, he is implying that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;wants to turn back history to earlier political times and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;rights based on birth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; He says nor implies any such thing
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I believe that we are again engaged in a great civil war, a
<br>
cultural war that's about to hijack your birthright to think and
<br>
say what resides in your heart.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The &quot;birthright&quot; he is referring to is the birth of our nation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and the right of free speech.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;His quote of Lincoln was referring to the birth of our nation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the right of free speech.  
</em><br>
<p>As I indicated.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;However, Heston said we are about to fight *another* such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;war today when he said, &quot;Those words are true again.  I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that we are again engaged in a great civil war, a cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;war....&quot;  This second war is not referring to the first one.
</em><br>
<p>Correct, he is referring to the subject of his speech, free speech
<br>
vs politically correct speech.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;When he says that he that our problems are bigger than the gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;issue, he implies that the gun issue is at its core.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Nonsense, he's saying there are more important issues than guns
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and that he should be listed to for what he is saying, not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; because he is the elected president of the NRA.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;He clearly describes his realization of this bigger issue in terms
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of his being president of the NRA and being &quot;in the cross hairs of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those who target Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;firearms are not the only issue.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Correct, but he is not saying nor implying that guns are at the
<br>
core of the issue, you did that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; he's saying that if there is such a thing as black pride then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; white pride, red pride, is equally valid. He is correct.
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;He is correct.  But he doesn't say all pride is equally valid.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes he does &quot; But when I told an audience last year that white
<br>
pride is just as valid as black pride or red pride or anyone else's
<br>
pride, they called me a racist.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;just as valid&quot;  equally valid, same thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;He is specifically arguing for the validity of white pride.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt;singles it out and implies that it needs to be bolstered up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compared to the others.  He implies that whites need more pride
</em><br>
<em>&gt;now while blacks and other races have enough pride.
</em><br>
<p>He neither said nor implied any such thing as clearly quoted above,
<br>
he said all were &quot;just as valid.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Yes, sometimes these groups do try to get special treatment laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; passed, hate crimes are an example. When someone who is gay 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; refers  to themselves as gay they have drawn a distinction, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is equally ok for anyone else to make that distinction.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Hate crime laws are not an example of gay rights.  They are racial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;laws which sometimes include sexual orientation or gender.  These
</em><br>
<em>&gt;laws give sentencing guidelines for criminals not rights to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;citizens.  Gay equal-rights laws would be ones advocating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;marriage, cohabitation, insurance, joint tax returns, inheriting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;property, joint ownership of property, etc.
</em><br>
<p><p>Hate crime laws are most certainly special treatment. Laws which
<br>
seek to hire gays to achieve some sort of arbitrarily defined
<br>
multiculturality are also special treatment.
<br>
<p>I support equal rights for gay/lesbians on marriage, cohabitation,
<br>
insurance, joint tax returns, inheriting property, joint ownership 
<br>
of property etc, but not special treatment.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;When he spoke against the Axis Powers in World War II, and draws
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;a parallel between the holocaust and what is currently happening
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;to gun owners, he implies the holocaust was less than it was or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;that gun control equals Nazi atrocities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; He implies no such thing, he said &quot;But during a speech, when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews and singling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.&quot; He is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; arguing against singling out those who haven't done anything 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wrong, he is talking about unreasoned prejudice.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Give me a break.  He compares gun-owners' persecution to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Holocaust.  
</em><br>
<p>He compares singling out of innocent Jews to the singling out of
<br>
innocent gun owners, there is no mention of the Holocaust.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;He compares gun-control advocates to Nazis.  
</em><br>
<p>Where does he do that? I can't find it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is inflammatory hyperbole at best.  I can't believe anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would argue for the validity of this analogy. It was a stupid PR
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blunder, period.
</em><br>
<p>You try giving us the break, you're the one on a witch hunt here.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;When he gives an example of dental patients who got AIDS from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;dentists who didn't disclose it, he implies that AIDS patients
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;must be publicly disclosed and kept away from the general
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;public.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; He did not say anything about keeping them away, but he does 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; feel their patients have a right to know. Shall we take a vote?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;No, but you make my point for me.  You think you know what he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;said, but read it carefully.  He never said the patients have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right to know.  He merely implied it.  He said it was bad that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they didn't know.  You are taking the ball and running with it. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You are deriving conclusions from the speech that were not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explicitly spelled out as part of his agenda.  This is the exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kind of implications I was talking about.  I think you caught this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one because you agreed with it.  I think you would catch more of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the other ones if you were inclined to agree with them as well.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;a.. In New Jersey, despite the death of several patients
<br>
nationwide who had been infected by dentists who had concealed
<br>
their AIDS --- the state commissioner announced that health
<br>
providers who are HIV-positive need not....need not..... tell their
<br>
patients that they are infected&quot;.
<br>
<p>Your right, he did not specifically say that patients had a right
<br>
to know, he said that a law which allowed dentists to conceal the
<br>
fact that they were HIV-positive was wrong.
<br>
<p>The opposite of conceal is to reveal.
<br>
<p>For the record I do think dentists need to inform their patients if
<br>
they're HIV positive, my dentist sticks himself all the time....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;When he points out that Dr. King said &quot;negroes&quot; but its not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;allowed now, he implies that we should be allowed classify
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;people into another race by the color of their skin.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;He was specifically arguing against hyphenated terminology like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;African-American which refers to their geographical origin.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was specifically arguing for the terms &quot;black&quot; or &quot;negro&quot; which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;refers to the color of their skin.  He wants to classify these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people by the color of their skin and not by their geographical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;origin.  It seems obvious from the words.
</em><br>
<p>He said we used to use these terms but they are no longer allowed.
<br>
He makes no such arguments about classifying people by the color of
<br>
their skin. He argues against race related hyphenation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; COME ON NOW! How do you derive that from what he said! From now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on  anyone referring to me as &quot;white&quot; is a racist. Now do you see?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I agree.  If someone didn't want to call people Scottish, British,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Irish, Swedish, but insisted that they all be called &quot;white&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because they look alike, I think that would be racist.  It's more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than just a passing adjective.  Heston is actually arguing against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one set of terminology and for another.  This is not a statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out of context.  He is actually giving a speech to the NRA about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their right to use the word &quot;negro&quot; instead of &quot;African-American&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because they prefer the term.
</em><br>
<p>Busted! He was not giving a speech to the NRA, but to the Harvard
<br>
law school forum.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;When he claims to be a Native American because he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;blood-initiated into a tribe, he implies that we should discount
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;any racism that native Americans see because he is one and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;doesn't see any discrimination.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; He referred to this in a very brief discussion as to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; awkwardness of hyphenated names. Mr. Heston believes citizens of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this country are &quot;Americans&quot;, period.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Then why does he want to distinguish between race, sex, or sexual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;orientation then?  Why not call them all American?  They are all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;American&quot; when he doesn't want to recognize differences, but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are all different groups when he does want to recognize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;differences.  Likewise, he wants freedom of speech for some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;topics, but then argues against freedom of speech for certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;songs, teachers or entertainers.
</em><br>
<p>Because these are area all covered by politically correct speech,
<br>
he does recognize differences, in fact he states that it is
<br>
perfectly okay to talk about differences in free speech, not
<br>
politically correct speech.
<br>
<p>At no point does he argue against free speech for certain songs,
<br>
teachers, or entertainers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;When he says one can talk about race without being a racist, he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;implies that he wants to talk about race and make decisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;based on race.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; No, he means what he said, I can refer to someone as black or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Hispanic or white or anything else, imparting information 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; without negatively discriminating.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;Talking about race&quot; is more than just referencing someone.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wants to &quot;recognize&quot; the difference, &quot;discuss&quot; the differences,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and by implication act on the differences.
</em><br>
<p>In politically correct speech, one has to speak differently about
<br>
minorities, gender, and sexual preference than one does to talk
<br>
about white heterosexual males. He is saying this is wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; When he says you can accept but not celebrate homosexuality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; without being a homophobe, he implies that we can accept that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; it  exists but we don't have to like it or even cooperate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; He didn't say the second part but in this case  I think that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a pretty good implication based on the facts.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Again, he didn't say it, but it sure is implied.  Why did you feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compelled to agree that it's a pretty good implication based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the facts?  
</em><br>
<p>Because he clearly said it? &quot;We don't have to like it or even
<br>
cooperate with it&quot;. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We&quot; he has included himself.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Because it is clear what the implication is, even if he doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say it.  Again, I believe that you would see more of the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;implications if you were inclined to agree with them.  Or, let me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ask this in a more leading way:  Do you think a racist would read
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more of these implications into this speech than you would?  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think the code-words and possible implications are there for those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who want to latch onto them.
</em><br>
<p>I agreed with the above implication because he clearly included
<br>
himself in the reference when he said &quot;we&quot;. 
<br>
<p>I think racists will infer whatever they wish to. 
<br>
<p>Are you saying there is a secret society of racists amongst the
<br>
members of the Harvard Law School Forum? This is where he gave this
<br>
speech.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;When he says disobedience is in our DNA and follows the awesome
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;power of Gandhi, Thoreau, and Jesus, he implies a racial rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;and manifest destiny for certain groups.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; For Indians, writers and a christian mystic?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;No.  He said who he was addressing.  &quot;You are the best and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brightest. You, here in the fertile cradle of American academia,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here in the castle of learning on the Charles River, you are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cream.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>So you do think there is a secret racist society at Harvard? ( ;)
<br>
)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; You mean the part about the ICE-T song about murdering an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;innocent cop? He was taking that position as a stockholder that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;it was wrong for the company to profit from such a thing, and he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;put his reputation on the line to defend what he thought was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;right.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Exactly.  He argues for his right to use terms and say things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people don't want him to say, but then he also brags that he got
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ice-T's contract canceled because he didn't like the lyrics of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;song.  I thought this was inconsistent.
</em><br>
<p>He said as a stockholder that Time Warner shouldn't be profiting
<br>
from this song, a song about murdering police officers, so he did
<br>
something about it, he shamed the board into stopping it's
<br>
profiteering, well within his rights.
<br>
<p>I think ICE-T had a right to write/sing it, but I wouldn't ever buy
<br>
it, and quite honestly would think less of anyone who did. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Heston's speech was about free speech, not the political correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jargon that passes for free speech these days, period.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I wish.  If he had argued for free speech for everybody, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have agreed.  But he seemed to criticize the speech of others as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much as he argued for his own right to speak.  I did not feel like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he was arguing for my right to speak on any issues I might speak
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out on.
</em><br>
<p>But Harvey he WAS! He was arguing for the right of free speech, and
<br>
against political correctness.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;As I read this, I felt like Heston would classify me as one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;liberals, as one of the politically correct, as one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-Christians, or in some other way as one of the enemy in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;cultural war&quot; or second &quot;civil war&quot; that he is fighting.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certainly did not feel that he was arguing for my rights.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fact, I got the distinct impression that he was against gay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights, women's rights, blacks rights, native American rights and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;many other rights for groups that were somehow different than his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;own.  In fact, the only rights he specifically supported seemed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be for white, males in the U.S. who shared a birthright of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;revolution.  This was not an inclusive speech.
</em><br>
<p>Heston has a long history of fighting for civil rights, that in
<br>
most peoples books would make him a liberal. He is reported to be
<br>
a very religious man, most people would call that conservative. I
<br>
believe him to be for equal rights for everyone. I believe the
<br>
evidence is in my favor.
<br>
<p>I understand that you don't see this as inclusive, it probably was
<br>
not intended that way,  he was arguing that political correctness
<br>
is wrong, that advocates of free speech need to take a tough stand,
<br>
and his speech was a shot across the bow of those we fight.
<br>
<p>There is a low grade war going on in this country, and has been for
<br>
awhile, it is a cultural war, and the Second Amendment protectors
<br>
and the anti-gun people are on opposite sides. A good evaluation of
<br>
this conflict can be found in &quot;The Samurai, The Mountie, and The
<br>
Cowboy: Should America adopt the gun Controls of other
<br>
Democracies?&quot; by David Kopel, a must read for anyone interested in
<br>
the conflict.
