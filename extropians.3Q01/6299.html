<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;Perhaps it is too much to hope that we will respond to this shattering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;tragedy as well as the Israelis, who have a long history of preventing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;similar atrocities by encouraging their civilians to carry concealed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;weapons and to shoot back at criminals and terrorists.  But it is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that policy of a distributed response to a distributed threat, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;every single citizen taking personal responsibility for the defense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;life and freedom, that our best hope for preventing recurrences of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;today's mass murders almost certainly lies.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Everything is *not* a gun issue.  Terrorists aren't roaming the streets 
<br>
shooting people.  If every single New Yorker was armed yesterday, that would 
<br>
not have had any impact whatsoever on airliners slamming into skyscrapers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yeah, and we know how peaceful it is in and around Israel as a result. :-/
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Violence feeds the violence cycle.
</em><br>
<p>This is true, unless one party is so violent as to eliminate or completely 
<br>
subjugate its adversary.  Remember Nagasaki?  After that...sweet peace in 
<br>
the valley.

<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
