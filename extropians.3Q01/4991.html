<br>
<p><em>&gt; When I have such debates, they sometimes reduce to me asking a person to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show why he is not a bigot, authoritarian, or fascist, and him asking me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why I refuse to accept certain common values as absolute.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I'm with you here.  I believe that there really are such 
<br>
things as bigotry, authoritarianism, harmful condescension,
<br>
collectivism, racism, inconsistency, lack of compassion, 
<br>
arrogance, and unfairness, and that they should be exposed
<br>
and demonized.  (By the way, I thought you were a nominalist?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree morality exists. I just do not agree it is always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same, or must always be the same.
</em><br>
<p>No.  I can't agree that we should agree to say that morality
<br>
exists---that's really going too far.  It clearly all comes
<br>
down to what people approve of and what they don't approve of.
<br>
If we attempt to get precisely factual, we simply cannot appeal
<br>
to &quot;moral laws&quot;, or &quot;rights&quot; (except legal ones), or any of 
<br>
that stuff unless it's clearly shorthand for &quot;I approve&quot; or
<br>
&quot;I disapprove&quot;.  The purpose of showing someone that he or
<br>
she is arrogant, or lacks compassion, or is a fascist is to
<br>
make him or her feel bad.  By **their** own semantic links
<br>
and real connection to the world and to other individuals
<br>
in the world, and their own conscious (and unconscious) and
<br>
unavoidable judgments of others, if one can show a sufficient
<br>
real similarity, his or her own conscience will be activated.
