<em>&gt; &gt; If you have access to Murray and Herrnstein's The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Bell Curve, do read their introduction, where they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; acknowledge that differences in race is a terribly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; difficult topic to study or even discuss.  They lay out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their approach, to be as honest, open minded, fair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and logical as is humanly possible.  Whether or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we agree with their conclusions, Murray and Herrnstein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are worth the time to read methinks, as are their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; many opponents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just to spill a few more worms from our already battered can, I've got to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take issue with reference to The Bell Curve. As far as I am aware, this book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been thoroughly debunked... here are a couple of quick references that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scratched (or googled) up.
</em><br>
<p>There was very little to debunk since it actually contained
<br>
pretty credible research and carefully worded conclusions. 
<br>
However, it was sensationalized to say all matter of things that
<br>
are easy to debunk.  It was said to watch.   Did you read this
<br>
entire book, btw?  I did.

<em>&gt; &quot;Take the racist beliefs of the Ku Klux Klan or the Aryan Nation. Cloak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those beliefs in academic robes and what do you get? You get a best seller.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Well that certainly sounds like a sound objective voice talking,
<br>
now doesn't it?  Sheesh!
