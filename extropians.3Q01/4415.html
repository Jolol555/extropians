</em><br>
<em>&gt; any shortage of people trying to adopt most kinds of babies. Many of them
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This has been raised so many times in all the abortion
<br>
discussions that you would hope there is a FAQ somewhere. 
<br>
Carrying a pregnancy to term is physically rough on the body and
<br>
emotionally/psychologically a very powerful experience.  It is a
<br>
very difficult thing to carry a baby to term and then give it
<br>
up.  Being pregnant and having a baby is very disruptive.  To
<br>
have to do this just because one accidentally got pregnant would
<br>
be an extremely major imposition.  It would very much be
<br>
involuntary servitude to the fetus if the woman did not desire a
<br>
child at this time.  This should be the end of the matter.  How
<br>
many people would love to adopt is not relevant.  
<br>
<p>Most abortions are not late-term.  This should also be in the
<br>
FAQ.  
<br>
<p>What you are proposing seldom makes any sense at all regardless
<br>
of what government does or doesn't say.
