Barbara Lamar asks
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What meaning do people on this list give to the term &quot;capitalism&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Lee replies with the dictionary definition:
<br>
&quot;an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of
<br>
capital
<br>
goods, by investments that are determined by private decision rather than by
<br>
state control, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that
<br>
are determined mainly by competition in a free market.&quot;
<br>
______________________________________________________________________
<br>
<p><p>I think that I would replace the word &quot;system&quot; with &quot;state of being&quot;. The
<br>
word system does fit if one looks at its definition, but it also seems to
<br>
connotate that the &quot;system&quot; Capitalism and the &quot;system&quot; Communism or the
<br>
&quot;system&quot; Fascism are somehow the same. I cant bring myself to look at it
<br>
like this though. System seems to connotate some type of structure imposed.
<br>
Nature may be imposing this form of interaction, but man isn't imposing it.
<br>
I agree with Lee when he says that it is the system that naturally arises
<br>
from free markets (which in an of themselves are a naturally developing
<br>
thing). Nature imposes Capitalism, man imposes all other forms. Isn't this
<br>
difference big enough to demand a subdivion of concepts much like rain,
<br>
snow, hail are all precipitation? Capitalism is after all is what happens
<br>
when one quits trying to impose systems on man.
