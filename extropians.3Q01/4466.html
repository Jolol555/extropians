<p>The Anglosphere: Cloning and the New Jacobins
<br>
By JAMES C. BENNETT
<br>
<p>&nbsp;WASHINGTON, Aug. 18 (UPI) -- Cloning and the public-policy debates about
<br>
it throughout the Anglosphere are a good example of the clash of visions
<br>
between the Lockean, Burkean, and Rousseauean temperaments in Anglosphere
<br>
politics.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;A curious coalition of the religious right and anti-science left has been
<br>
whipping up a storm about the idea of a nationwide, or even worldwide ban on
<br>
human reproductive cloning lately. It is uniting Christian conservative
<br>
Republicans with Socialist Bernie Saunders in passing a Federal cloning ban
<br>
in the U.S. House of Representatives.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Meanwhile, Tony Blair's Labor government has moved to ban human cloning in
<br>
Britain, while Canada's Liberal government has begun consideration of the
<br>
same action, which has also been endorsed by conservative voices there.
<br>
Where do the positions on cloning fit in this scheme of temperaments?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;In any strong civil society, banning an entire field of human endeavor is
<br>
a serious step, and one fraught with constitutional considerations.  In
<br>
particular, this action threatens the pact, which lies at the heart of the
<br>
Burkean temperament, between past, present, and future generations, by
<br>
depriving future generations of whatever benefits the banned action might
<br>
have produced.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;In order to run the risk of so depriving our children, we must have a good
<br>
case that the dangers of permitting the action are so great, and the chances
<br>
of curing them by later action so small, that we must take a sweeping action
<br>
now.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Radicals do not shy away from the sweeping action; rather, they revel in
<br>
it.  It is already clear that the Lockean temperament, by and large, would
<br>
see the choice of cloning as one of those decisions best left to the
<br>
individual. But does a cloning ban pass the Burkean test?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;First, we should dispose of the issue of the high risks in current cloning
<br>
technologies.  It is pretty obvious that the current state of the art in
<br>
cloning carries very high risks to any potential child conceived, and would
<br>
not pass the effectiveness or safety tests of the FDA.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Few Burkeans, and for that matter few Lockeans, would object to a
<br>
temporary ban on human cloning until the technology could overcome some
<br>
serious problems with its safety. That would require no new legislation in
<br>
almost any country.  Regulatory action under existing legislation would be
<br>
quite adequate.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Second, we can dismiss pretty quickly the &quot;revulsion&quot; argument made by
<br>
Leon Kass (Bush's new appointee to head a Federal bioethics committee) in
<br>
The New Republic. Cloning, he argues, is bad because it creates a sense of
<br>
revulsion in him, and that's enough.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Unfortunately, this is a terrible basis for making public policy. I do not
<br>
wish to compare Kass directly to others who in the Twentieth Century made
<br>
their emotions the central test of their politics, because the list is so
<br>
terrible, from Hitler on down.    Rather, I would appeal to him to
<br>
reconsider. What do you do about those people in whom cloning does not
<br>
create a sense of moral revulsion?  Deprive them of a public policy voice? A
<br>
politics of revulsion promises to enshrine some class of people whose
<br>
revulsion is more privileged than others, creating a new de facto
<br>
aristocracy. A politics of revulsion is in itself poison to a civil society.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Francis Fukuyama, writing in The Wall Street Journal, brings some more
<br>
rationally-founded objections to the table. To permit cloning, he argues,
<br>
would put us on the slippery slope toward commercialization of the human
<br>
reproductive function. Soon, the rich would be able to buy brighter,
<br>
healthier, better-looking children than the rest of us, creating a race of
<br>
genetic super humans which might permanently rule the rest of us.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;But these fears are largely misplaced. Even if they could breed such a
<br>
race, they would probably be disappointed. Having an IQ of above, say, 140
<br>
is probably more of a liability than an asset in politics. The beautiful IQ
<br>
200 children would probably find politics so boring that they would never
<br>
dominate anybody, although they might just solve Fermat's Last Theorem.
<br>
I and many others would worry more about starting down the slippery slope of
<br>
government control of reproduction, which is far more worrisome (and far
<br>
more likely) than commercialization of reproduction.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It is likely that the most egregious abuse of human cloning would not be
<br>
from some millionaire making a dozen clones of himself, but of saddam
<br>
Hussein or Kim Jong Il making ten thousand Dear Leader clones apiece.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;State abuse of cloning is more likely than private abuse, and it is the
<br>
least likely abuse to be controlled by a supposedly worldwide ban on
<br>
cloning. The theoretical basis of cloning is well enough understood now that
<br>
Iraq or North Korea (neither of which would be deterred by the human costs
<br>
of proceeding prematurely) could easily move to implement such a program,
<br>
which would be far harder to detect than nuclear weapons development.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It is also curious than people concerned about the breeding of a race of
<br>
superintelligent masters should be worried about cloning-that is the one
<br>
advanced reproductive technology which guarantees that the child will be no
<br>
smarter than its parent. It is also true that the clone will not be an
<br>
identical copy of its parent, given the importance of both gestational
<br>
environment and early childhood environment to the intelligence, health,
<br>
appearance, and possibly even sexual orientation of the child.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;To those who think of a clone as a copy of the parent, this raises the
<br>
question &quot;What's the point?&quot; But to those who see cloning as merely a way of
<br>
having a child when all other means are closed off, yet which still
<br>
maintains a genetic link to one parent, this non-identicality is either
<br>
irrelevant or actually welcome.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It is also the case that such parents, who would be the most numerous
<br>
immediate users of cloning, would likely turn to other, newer techniques as
<br>
it became possible for them to create children having the genes of both
<br>
parents. Cloning, far from being the Frankenstein technology taking over our
<br>
future, is more likely to be an interim technology granting imperfect
<br>
assistance to a relatively small class of persons suffering from a
<br>
particular physical disability.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Thus a permanent, worldwide ban on cloning are is both unlikely to be
<br>
effective against state action, and has real costs for individuals. The
<br>
positive goods which are already likely to come from successful cloning are
<br>
real.  To allow continued animal research until we know whether it will
<br>
someday be safe to try on humans seems to pass the Burkean test, as would a
<br>
temporary ban combined with a willingness to discuss and experiment with a
<br>
variety of possible controls and conditions for going forward.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;A permanent, universal prohibition on cloning, in contrast, is the
<br>
recourse of a radical, Rousseauean, Jacobin temperament.  Such people never
<br>
fail to reach for sweeping coercion as the first, rather than the last
<br>
resort, and delight in subjecting the whole world to their view of the
<br>
right, rejecting the possibility that they might be wrong.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Fortunately, America's Founding Fathers, although they did not anticipate
<br>
cloning, (excepting possibly Franklin) did understand the Burkean virtue of
<br>
avoiding sweeping governmental edicts, and permitting a variety of
<br>
worldviews to find expression in different laws in different places. This
<br>
temperament is supremely embodied in the Constitution, as is the Lockean
<br>
temperament in the Declaration of Independence.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Persons who normally exhibit Lockean and Burkean temperaments have been
<br>
carried away in the cloning debate.  They would do well to consider the
<br>
opinions of calmer heads such as Professor Glenn Reynolds, of the University
<br>
of Tennessee Law School.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Reynolds, a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights and of limiting
<br>
Federal powers, has written persuasively that the House's cloning ban
<br>
probably fails to pass the Constitutional tests for such powers, tests which
<br>
were put in place precisely to prevent the radical temperament from
<br>
overrunning sound public policy. Perhaps President Bush should consider
<br>
appointing scholars like Reynolds to join Kass's committee, in order to
<br>
restore some balance to the debate.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Then perhaps we can have a Burkean experimentation with many different
<br>
approaches to balancing the potential goods and hazards of cloning, genetic
<br>
engineering, and the many other highly promising, yet potentially dangerous
<br>
technologies like nanotechnology, that lie just ahead of us.
