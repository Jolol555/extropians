In a paper (&quot;Are You Living in a Simulation?&quot;,
<br>
<a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/sim/simulation.doc">http://www.nickbostrom.com/sim/simulation.doc</a>) recommended by Brian
<br>
Atkins, Nick Bostrom argues that
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  at least one of the following propositions is true:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posthuman stage; (2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run significant number of simulations or (variations) of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary history; (3) we are almost certainly living in a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation.  
</em><br>
<p>His argument is plausible, but I would argue that it gives us no cause
<br>
to change our behavior.  It has the same feel as this parody of the
<br>
Christian's claim: &quot;There exists an omnipotent, omniscient being who
<br>
almost never interferes in the world we perceive.&quot;  In both cases, no
<br>
evidence is proffered; in fact, in both cases the claim is that evidence
<br>
doesn't exist because of the way the system is set up.  
<br>
<p>Nick makes a more convincing argument based on statistical reasoning,
<br>
but it doesn't provide any different cause of action.  If it's true, we
<br>
should do the same things as if it's not true.  We should look for gaps
<br>
in our understanding of how the universe works, and we should choose
<br>
goals and pursue them.  Nick implies that we might be better off not
<br>
trying to develop too much computational power, since that might force
<br>
our hosts to turn off the power.  
<br>
<p>I don't buy it.  While the argument is reasonable that we may be living
<br>
in a sim, it doesn't give us evidence that there are limits to the power
<br>
that may be available to the hosts, or what those limits might be.  
<br>
<p>The argument leaves me in the same position I was in before.  The
<br>
universe doesn't give us any purposes, we have to invent our own.  It
<br>
doesn't provide useful guidance in choosing among purposes, so it
<br>
shouldn't have any effect on us.
<br>
<p>Should we try to make the simulation end as the Tibetan Buddhists are
<br>
reputed to be doing?  Should we do what we can to lengthen the extent of
<br>
the simulation, at the cost of foregoing some things we would otherwise
<br>
chose to do?  If we wanted to lengthen or shorten the span of the
<br>
simulation, what evidence do we have about what actions would be effective?
<br>
<p>Better to believe that the universe is as it presents itself to us, and
<br>
choose goals and approaches based on that evidence.  A creator that
<br>
wanted us to do otherwise (or that put conscious entities in a situation
<br>
where that was the best thing to do) is not worth bowing to.
<br>
<p>Chris
<br>
<p>(I read the paper without equations, since the paper is only available
<br>
in Word format.  I assume the text I found among the raw bits is the
<br>
text Word displays.)
