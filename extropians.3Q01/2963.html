<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with Harvey that the article was strongly racist, but I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he somewhat missed the point of the essay.  A few quotes for the benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of those who have lost it:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You can pay me reparations, Johnny.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To start with, I figure you owe me for three bicycles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The implication is that the bicycles were stolen by black people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that Johnny Cochran is therefore responsible because he is black,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a racist claim.
</em><br>
<p>If Johnny Cochran is speaking publicly as a representative of his
<br>
'race', then he is accepting responsibility for all of the acts of
<br>
african americans, not just the labor of slave african americans 150+
<br>
years ago. As such, he is accepting responsiblity for Fred's three
<br>
stolen bicycles (if they were, in fact, stolen by african americans).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A few years back, my middle-school daughter brought home a horrendously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; misspelled science hand-out. Now, Johnny: You and I both know that it's easy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to make a typo, and write &quot;phenylkeetone&quot; instead of &quot;phenylketone.&quot; But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;feemelkeebome&quot; is stretching it. The errors were of this sort. An
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understanding of chemistry clearly had never rippled the serene surface of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; woman's mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Without thinking, I asked, &quot;What color is your teacher?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His first unthinking reaction at seeing a bad misspelling was suspicion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the teacher was black.  This is a racist reaction.
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily. Anyone familiar with african american dialects could
<br>
recognise this as a conceivably 'ebonic' interpretation of the word in
<br>
an onomatopeoiac basis. Since non-blacks, by definition, do not practice
<br>
ebonic dialects, it therefore follows that this word was misspelled by a
<br>
black person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But here's a large ravage of slavery, Johnny: Fear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What price do we put on looking over our shoulders? On watching to be sure we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't go one subway stop too far? Warning our girlfriends not to drive on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; certain streets? Checking the clientele of Seven-Eleven before going in at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; night?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; People in, say, Switzerland can walk their streets after dark. We can't. Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What have we got that they don't, that might cause fear?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The implication is that blacks are dangerous criminals, a racist claim.
</em><br>
<p>What we have that the Swiss don't is a nationwide patchwork of fascist
<br>
gun control laws passed by white governments and structured primarily to
<br>
disarm law abiding citizens, especially law abiding poor and african
<br>
american citizens. Many of these laws were passed as Jim Crow laws, but
<br>
they all are generally supported by african american leaders as a
<br>
cynical tactic to keep their constituents trapped in high crime ghettos,
<br>
living in fear and voting the party line.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The white guy beaten to death 100 yards from my door last year - they never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; caught the killers, but - what you reckon, Johnny? Do you figure it was white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Presbyterian women from the old-ladies' home?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The implication is that black people are more likely to beat someone to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death than white people, a racist claim.
</em><br>
<p>Not if it is based on fact. It is a FACT, for example, that a huge
<br>
majority of all crime is committed by african americans, despite the
<br>
fact that they make up only 10% of the population. Thus, statistically,
<br>
blacks ARE more likely to beat someone to death than a white person.
<br>
Refusing to acknowledge this statistical truth is, itself, racist. Stop
<br>
being a racist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As a result of slavery, you have been using our civilization without a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; license.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The implication is that black people are undeserving of the benefits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions of previous generations purely because of their skin color, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racist claim.
</em><br>
<p>No, what the implication is, is that a slave doesn't accept the same
<br>
responsibilities of citizenship that a non-slave does, doesn't pay
<br>
taxes, and therefore gets a 'free ride'. This is rather obviously
<br>
ignoring the fact that the slave surely doesn't enjoy the benefits that
<br>
a non-slave does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, the essay is so obviously drenched in racism that there is hardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any need in pointing out further examples.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The real issue is that the essay is also intended to be read ironically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is meant to be a satire on racist attitudes.  It aims to mirror some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the claims made by those calling for reparations in order to show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how racist those claims are when the racial roles are inverted.
</em><br>
<p>I've lived with, worked with, been shot at with, and hung out with
<br>
hundreds of black people while in the Air Force, which was a very
<br>
positive experience in eliminating my youthful ignorance of african
<br>
americans, having grown up in one of the 'whitest' areas of the country.
<br>
However, I can say that a significant number of the african americans I
<br>
met and befreinded in the service were themselves racist to such a high
<br>
level that they would have been driven out of the service for their
<br>
opinions if they had been white spouting similar opinions.
<br>
<p>Racism is not an exclusively white phenomenon, it is a standard human
<br>
response, that is common all over the world. Ask any Japanese or Chinese
<br>
person about their attitudes of other races, for example. Do the same in
<br>
ANY society in the world and you will find people are racist to one
<br>
degree or another, primarily depending on their education and degree of
<br>
exposure to other cultures.
<br>
<p>The essay referenced IS a satire on racist attitudes. It also calls into
<br>
question the politically correct attitudes about which wrongs are
<br>
acceptable, and which are being brushed under the rug out of liberal
<br>
'sensitivity' to the 'plight' of 'discriminated' minorities. Too many
<br>
whites suffer from liberal guilt programmed into them by ignorant
<br>
sociologists at liberal arts colleges that are full of propaganda and
<br>
half truths. 
<br>
<p>For those who think they know what 'racism' is, ask someone like Chris
<br>
Rock.
