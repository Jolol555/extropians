From: &quot;Greg Burch&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gregburch@gregburch.net?Subject=Re:%20Think%20For%20Yourself...%20Or%20Let%20Machines%20Do%20It%20For%20You?&In-Reply-To=&lt;028c01c133d9$358960c0$f35c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">gregburch@gregburch.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; when he asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why it was that few on the list would jump into a highly technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific or engineering discussion to offer strong opinions when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hadn't done their homework or engaged in the kind of basic background study
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would allow them to have an informed opinion, but in his area of deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expertise -- economics and institutional design -- every &quot;Tom, Dick and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Harry&quot; feels like they have a perfect right to pop off with opinions about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most fundamental concepts without studying the basic literature or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; familiarizing themselves with the background material in the area
</em><br>
<p>That's because in a democratic social order people vote on issues concerning
<br>
economics and institutional design, but highly technical scientific or
<br>
engineering issues are decided by empirical applications, direct observation
<br>
and hard science, not by voting.
<br>
Relying on authority and other templates of conformity works with history,
<br>
law, politics and culture, but in the real world where the rubber meets the
<br>
road, it's best to directly engage the dynamic changes that constitute
<br>
reality. IOW, you can go by the book when you're writing one, but real life
<br>
requires real immediacy, which means figuring things out for yourself in the
<br>
here and now instead of relying on the literature. This is why the evolution
<br>
of machines that can think for themselves augers to supercede humans (most of
<br>
whom do not think for themselves, but rather rely on the literature).
<br>
<p>Autonomous thinking
<br>

<br>
The &quot;Three-Dimensional Artificial Neural Network&quot; processor is capable of
<br>
recognising objects in real time and in highly cluttered background scenes. It
<br>
can process an image and is capable of a certain degree of judgment about the
<br>
objects, in the same way as a person looks at a variety of objects and makes
<br>
judgments about their nature.
<br>
<p>Two technologies give the compact processor this ability to process a stream
<br>
of images in a way similar to that used by the human eye-brain combination.
<br>
One is interconnected networks of ultra-low-power electronic synapses on very-
<br>
large-scale-integrated chips that mimic the core of a brain. The other is the
<br>
three- dimensional stacking of those chips in a sugar-cube sized package.
<br>
<p>The device achieves a computing speed of more than a trillion operations per
<br>
second but using only 8 watts of power. That is more than a thousand times
<br>
faster than a typical commercially available desktop computer that consumes
<br>
more than 100 watts. Engineers believe potential commercial benefits for the
<br>
new technology may be found in public safety and in creating a personal
<br>
computer that can respond to the users emotional state by simply responding to
<br>
facial expressions. The development may also be useful to the video game
<br>
industry in improving interactive technologies.
<br>
<p>Creating devices that can exist autonomously and 'think' for themselves will
<br>
make space travel and exploration easier. B2K recently reported on NASA's
<br>
Hyperion, which has been engineered to follow the sun to maintain its energy
<br>
supplies.
<br>
<p>I see the light
<br>
US Carnegie Mellon University and NASA developed Hyperion, a solar-powered
<br>
robot to first traverse Earth and then move on to other planets.
<br>
<p>The robot has been designed to be as self-sufficient as possible, powered by
<br>
the sun and able to track to the whereabouts of our star for optimum
<br>
sustainability.
<br>
<p>It will do this by traveling against Earth's rotation in synchrony with the
<br>
sun. It must determine its position and orientation with respect to the sun
<br>
while exploring its surroundings. It must navigate to capture enough sunlight
<br>
to power itself while traveling and trying to achieve its objectives. Whilst
<br>
solar-powered robots aren't new, being able to track the sun to obtain maximum
<br>
energy is. With this in mind, the robot's name, which comes from Greek
<br>
mythology, roughly translates to &quot;He who follows the sun&quot;.
<br>
<p>Robotic exploration of planetary surfaces is restricted by the availability of
<br>
solar power and by temperature extremes. With a constant energy source and
<br>
moderate temperatures, surface exploration missions could last for months or
<br>
years. These requirements can be met by sun-synchronous circumnavigation. By
<br>
setting their speed appropriate to their latitude and navigating to avoid
<br>
shadows cast by local terrain, these solar-powered robots will be able to
<br>
operate continuously. Also, by following the dawn, these rovers may be able to
<br>
regulate their climate by remaining in the transient temperature region
<br>
between night-time cold and daytime hot.

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)

<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most

regressive force now operating in society.
