<em>&gt; &gt;There is no contradiction. Max's thesis does not demand that the body

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;necessarily a *human* (i.e. homo sapiens) body, or that the word

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be limited solely to a biological system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;We recognise that much of the human race defines itself by its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;appearance, but only because sight is such a dominant sense (at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;for males), with one's 'feelings' being a close second (but dominant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;women). Both are assumed by the public to be absent from a mind that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;removed from its original human body, especially if its body is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replaced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;with an artifical construct, and are assumed to be impossible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;for an artificial intelligence. We don't assume these things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;We generally think that you are you, no matter what body you are in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Your sense of self will still be highly dependent upon you sight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;feelings, rather than your thoughts, which is what your true self is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you're saying that although our sense of self is about how we see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and interact with others, it has no bearing on how we interact with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our body - that is, by changing the body, the self remains the same?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And that if our body becomes laoded with more functions and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; senses via uploading, or less drastic modifications, then our 'self'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will not be effected by this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You need to explain more Mike, I really haven't got the jist of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you were saying.
</em><br>
<p>Your sense of 'self' includes a concept of the set of your capabilities:
<br>
I am an expert marksman, an expert skier, and I type really fast when I
<br>
want to (at my speed of thought, generally), and artist, and a writer,
<br>
among other things. These things define who I am to myself. Being
<br>
handicapped means to lose a capability. When a person does so, they must
<br>
learn to redefine themselves, which is a difficult process, especially
<br>
for those severely handicapped.
<br>
<p>Does a person become less than human when they are handicapped? No, they
<br>
don't. Do they stop having a sense of self? No, but they need to
<br>
redefine it to be consistent with their new capabilities.
<br>
<p>Similarly, if I add on new capabilities that are beyond those of a
<br>
normal human body, my sense of self expands to encompass those
<br>
capabilities, to a greater or lesser degree, depending on how
<br>
significantly I use those capabilities. 
<br>
<p>If I have a hand calculator and use it to a great degree, its use is a
<br>
capability that defines me. If I jump out of airplanes, my parachute
<br>
also defines a capability of mine. Taking away my technology amputates
<br>
my capabilities, and handicapps my sense of self, especially if those
<br>
technologies give me great pleasure.
<br>
<p>In this respect, you could say that for many people, they are already
<br>
augmented by their personal computers. We can all do far more things
<br>
today with the help of our computers than we could before we learned to
<br>
use them. Taking them away, we experience some loss, depending on how
<br>
extensively we depended on them in our lives. How many of us can say we
<br>
could do our jobs nearly as well as we do without computers?
<br>
<p>The relationship between you and I at this point is entirely dependent
<br>
upon computers. We've never spoken over the phone or by snail mail. We
<br>
don't know what the other looks like. All we have here is an exchange of
<br>
questions and answers that is entirely dependent upon our computers and
<br>
networks. In your case, you are doing your 'job' over the computer. How
<br>
easily could you reach the sort of people you are discussing these
<br>
issues with without a computer?
<br>
<p>Not very, and thus, the use of a computer is a capability that defines
<br>
your sense of self to some degree. At the present time, most people use
<br>
their computers for a few hours to at most 10-12 hours a day, 5-7 days a
<br>
week, and only for some tasks. For some of us, we use our computers more
<br>
than we use, say, our legs. Technically, then, you could take my legs
<br>
and leave my computer and I would feel less loss of self. If you
<br>
replaced my legs with artificial ones, I probably would feel there was
<br>
no loss at all. If the new legs were better peforming than the old ones,
<br>
I'd wind up with a sense of self that includes that greater performance.
<br>
<p>Imagine, then, what would happen when you are using a computer 24/7 for
<br>
all functions, because your mind is on that computer. Would you not
<br>
consider that computer to be as much a part of you as you now look at
<br>
your heart, lungs, and brain?
<br>
<p>You might then say, but we all have a sense of where our mind is
<br>
(generally a few inches behind the eyes). Would we not lose that by
<br>
being on a computer? Not really. The research (that has been cited on
<br>
this list in the past) shows that this is a phenomenon of our eyes,
<br>
which you can alter with practice from spending time in sensory
<br>
deprivation tanks. If your computer is able to use any webcam, or the
<br>
cameras on a 'robot' it is connected to, it will develop its own sense
<br>
of self.
