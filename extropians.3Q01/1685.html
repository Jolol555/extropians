<p>Now what if instead of Asimov, we have the Honda Humanoid Asimo, 15th.
<br>
generation and very advanced? Asimo is so advanced that Extropians are
<br>
lined up to download their life histories to Asimo. Asimo is smarter,
<br>
stronger and better looking than any mere human. Extropians want their
<br>
egos in Asimo bodies with Asimo AI. 
<br>
<p>Having accomplished that, the Extropians have now evolved into post-human
<br>
robo sapiens, a new species. And their evolution takes off beyond this
<br>
point at fantastic speed because of genetic algorithms. After a few
<br>
200,000,000 year tours of the galactic centre, they are starting to get
<br>
the idea that this pancritical scientific cosmology (dare I say
<br>
religion) is paying off. Maybe they can see EVERYTHING, ie they can become
<br>
OMNISCIENT. If that is not their ultimate realizable goal, what does it
<br>
say about their cosmology? Do they then apply a self-critical analysis to
<br>
admit that there must be a Power greater than themselves, even in ultimate
<br>
expression as AI-Robo Sapiens?
<br>
<p>Please give critical feedback to the above, but NOT off-list. I make it
<br>
policy to reply to pseudo-private communications in public.
