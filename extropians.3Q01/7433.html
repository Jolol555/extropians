Coyote writes (or forwards?):
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   This Fla. EO places the Florida National Guard, a unit of the Federal U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Army, in control of all Florida law
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   enforcement (State FDLE, County Sheriffs, and local PD's) and the Florida
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Emergency Management department (Florida's FEMA under federal FEMA
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  control) Remember, this was 4 days before the WTC disaster.
</em><br>
<p>That's a misstatement of the order you just quoted.  The order allowed
<br>
the national guard to help train the local police.  It didn't put them
<br>
&quot;in control of all Florida law enforcement&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   Governor &quot;Jeb&quot; then signed Florida Executive Order No. 01-262 immediately
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   after the second WTC tower fell.  Florida was the first STATE to declare a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;State of Emergency&quot; and did so before New York State or the Federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Washington City leaders did, yet there were no &quot;terroristic&quot; incidents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that had taken place in Florida.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Florida EO 01-262 states, in part:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;I hereby declare that a state of emergency exists in the State of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Florida... The authority to suspend the effect of any statute or rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   governing the conduct of state business, and the further authority to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   suspend the effect of any order or rule of any governmental entity... The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   authority to seize and utilize any and all real or personal property as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   needed to meet this emergency... The authority to order the evacuation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   any or all persons from any location in the State of Florida, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   authority to regulate the movement of any or all persons to or from any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   location in the State; The authority to regulate the return of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  evacuees to their home communities... I hereby order the Adjutant General to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  activate the Florida National Guard for the duration of this emergency.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Again you have taken much of this material out of context.
<br>
<p>I believe the &quot;conduct of state business&quot; clause refers to the
<br>
government's conduct of its own functions, not to private enterprise
<br>
within the state.  This allows the different state agencies to cooperate
<br>
more closely.
<br>
<p>The property-seizing order continues, &quot;subject always to the duty of
<br>
the State to compensate the owner&quot;.  So property can be seized only with
<br>
just compensation.  This is a well established principle.
<br>
<p>Being able to evacuate people and control their return is a standard
<br>
police power.
<br>
<p>In short while I agree that declarations of emergency must be watched
<br>
carefully, it is incorrect to characterize this as &quot;martial law&quot;.
<br>
<p>I wonder how many other states have had similar orders issued in the days
<br>
since the WTC attacks?
<br>
<p>Hal
