<p>
Statement by Chairman James W. Lark in response
<br>
to September 11 terrorist attacks:
<br>
<p>WASHINGTON, DC -- On behalf of the Libertarian Party, I wish
<br>
to express our profound sorrow and grief for the tragic loss
<br>
of life and suffering caused by yesterday's terrorist
<br>
attacks. Our hearts go out to the victims and their grieving
<br>
families and friends. Nothing we say can ease the
<br>
devastation and sense of loss they feel -- and that every
<br>
other American certainly shares -- but we stand with them in
<br>
mourning the loss of friends, family, neighbors, co-workers,
<br>
loved ones, and fellow citizens.
<br>
<p>The Libertarian Party condemns the vicious and barbaric
<br>
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. There is
<br>
no excuse for such savage acts. No legitimate political or
<br>
religious ideology can
<br>
justify the murder of thousands of innocent people. These
<br>
actions, and the revulsion they cause to all decent people
<br>
around the world, demonstrate in the starkest way possible
<br>
that the initiation of force is never an
<br>
appropriate way to settle political or social differences.
<br>
<p>The result of such violence is more hatred, more grieving
<br>
relatives and friends, more tombstones -- and, ultimately,
<br>
more violence. Libertarians unequivocally reject the
<br>
initiation of force as a solution to the disagreements
<br>
between people and between governments.
<br>
<p>The Libertarian Party calls for justice to be meted out to
<br>
the terrorists responsible for the attacks. However, we
<br>
encourage the United States government to be sure that any
<br>
response is appropriate and measured. Action should not be
<br>
taken that will cause innocent people in other countries to
<br>
be killed because of the actions of terrorists. Such a
<br>
response would only continue the cycle of
<br>
violence and revenge.
<br>
<p>The Libertarian Party calls on all Libertarians to aid our
<br>
fellow Americans who have suffered from this horrible
<br>
tragedy: Donate blood for the victims fighting for their
<br>
lives in hospitals in New York and Washington, DC.
<br>
Contribute to the charities that will assist the families
<br>
and relatives. If you live near where the attacks
<br>
took place, volunteer to assist in rescue or recovery
<br>
efforts, as appropriate. And if you know any of the victims'
<br>
families, offer solace and support in any way you can. Now
<br>
is a time for all Libertarians to stand together
<br>
to help those who are suffering.
<br>
<p>The Libertarian Party calls on all Americans to act with
<br>
tolerance and kindness in the days to follow. A natural
<br>
reaction after such a tragedy is to find a scapegoat -- to
<br>
blame Arab-Americans, or individuals who practice the
<br>
Islamic faith, or other people who are in some
<br>
way different. We must rise above that impulse. If Americans
<br>
turn down a path of hatred and intolerance, then the
<br>
terrorists will have won.
<br>
<p>That's not the only way terrorists can win. In the past,
<br>
some have responded to terrorism with proposals to restrict
<br>
the civil liberties of Americans. We must resist that
<br>
tendency. The fundamental rights
<br>
that define the very essence of America should not be
<br>
destroyed in an effort to deal with terrorism or any other
<br>
problem. Citizens must remain ever vigilant that terrorists
<br>
don't win by turning America into the kind of
<br>
nation where our cherished freedoms are only a fading
<br>
memory.
<br>
<p>Finally, the Libertarian Party hopes these attacks will
<br>
elicit a thoughtful national discussion about how we can
<br>
prevent similar tragedies in the future. Of course, there is
<br>
no way to guarantee that evil will not strike again.
<br>
However, a foreign policy that limits our intervention in
<br>
the affairs and quarrels of other nations is a foreign
<br>
policy that will reduce the chance that terrorists will want
<br>
to strike at America. Peace and free trade with all nations,
<br>
and entangling alliances with none, is a time-honored
<br>
prescription for an America that is at peace with the world,
<br>
and for a nation that has little
<br>
to fear from the savage and bloodthirsty actions of
<br>
terrorists.
<br>
<p>Again, our hearts go out to the thousands of Americans who
<br>
suffered a loss during the terrible events of September 11,
<br>
2001. It is a tragic day that will live in our memories --
<br>
but is also a day that will allow the best of America to
<br>
shine through by virtue of our response.
