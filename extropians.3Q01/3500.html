<em>&gt; &gt; Why is this stuff on the Extropians List?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The Claremont Institute is not only a conservative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization, but it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specifically a religious conservative organization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why do you seem to always start off your denounciation of any post you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree with by claiming that the website that is hosting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information is owned by some allegedly extreme right wing organization?
</em><br>
<p>I don't always do this, but lately we seem to be swamped with reposts from
<br>
white supremacist organizations and religious organizations.  These posts
<br>
seek to garner support for racial or religious views that are contrary to
<br>
science or Extropianism.  The point above was not mean to imply that
<br>
conservatism is bad.  My point was they are more than just conservative,
<br>
they are specifically religious.  They are specifically trying to
<br>
reinterpret existing law and history to reshape the US into a Christian
<br>
nation.  Given that context, their interpretations of the Constitution,
<br>
Lincoln's policies, and racial policies are based on their religious beliefs
<br>
and not any objective statements.  Their concept of &quot;natural law&quot; is not the
<br>
libertarian version.  They seek to impose their version of &quot;God's Will&quot; into
<br>
their interpretations of law, history and rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While I agree with many of your points, Harvey, this is not a proper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debating tactic, as you and others continually claim in response to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my posts....
</em><br>
<p>When I point this out, I am not attacking them because they are religious.
<br>
I am pointing out that their terms are nonstandard.  I am pointing out that
<br>
their &quot;facts&quot; are mystically derived and not scientifically determined.  I
<br>
am pointing out that their interpretations of documents are &quot;divinely
<br>
guided&quot; and not literally based on what was actually written.  These are
<br>
valid criticisms of any proposed viewpoint.  I do not say that Christians
<br>
are invalid.  I say that their terms are nonstandard, their &quot;facts&quot; are not
<br>
scientific, and their interpretations more from their Bible than the
<br>
documents they are interpreting.  These are valid criticisms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that outside of a couple people asking the list for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions on outside information of this sort, the only people who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'remaking' anything are those of a more liberal stripe who whip out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tar brush so rapidly any time someone says something they don't agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with.
</em><br>
<p>The question was asked and answered.  Lots of people gave their opinion on
<br>
these outside sources of opinion.  I do not see liberals as refusing to
<br>
discuss or comment.  I see many liberal responses.  In contrast, it seems to
<br>
be the original posters of the information who are crying foul and do not
<br>
want to defend these views.  They call the criticisms unfair and do not
<br>
respond to the criticism.  In fact, most such postings end up being claimed
<br>
as &quot;testing the boundaries&quot; or &quot;just thrown out for comment&quot;.  The original
<br>
people say that they don't really believe all this stuff, they just
<br>
propagated it for no reason.  As such, the discussion cannot go anywhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a significant degree of conversation here recently about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racism, trust, liberty, etc. where many people are genuinely interested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in getting down to brass tacks about things. Practicing ostracism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead contributes nothing, and simply adds to the shrillness of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debate.
</em><br>
<p>But no debate is possible without the scientific method.  People who claim
<br>
secret knowledge with no source, religious inspiration, or guidance from
<br>
nature, do not present scientific theories which can be debated.  They do
<br>
not use the scientific method.  They do not have facts to test.  These are
<br>
unfalsifiable positions which cannot be debated logically.  They can only be
<br>
emotionally presented in a persuasive manner to make arbitrary decisions.
<br>
Real science experiments, test results, statistics on race, god and nature
<br>
would be on topic for this list.  Mysticism, natural law, default rights,
<br>
natural order of things, morality, god's will and the like are not on topic
<br>
for this list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am not interested in any way in making Extropy into a religion, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racist group, or a radical right wing movement, contrary to what some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here claim. I am staunchly a libertarian, and natural law is very much a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian concept. I agree that claims by the right that natural law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes from God is NOT libertarian, and not Extropian either, but I did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not see anything of this sort in the post that Harvey responded to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either.
</em><br>
<p>That's why I pulled in additional material from the website.  I found the
<br>
posting to be deliberately misleading.  When you read the background on the
<br>
website, which shows what they really mean by these terms, the article reads
<br>
a little differently.  When you read the methods from the website, where
<br>
they use prayer and God's guidance to reinterpret historical documents the
<br>
way they were meant by God, the interpretations seem to be more suspect.
<br>
When you read the goals on the website that they want to deliberately
<br>
reinterpret documents in a new way, to change our understanding of them so
<br>
that they mean something different than they were formerly believed to mean,
<br>
the history provided in the article does not seem to be as accurate.
<br>
<p>With this additional information, that they view &quot;natural law&quot; to mean
<br>
&quot;God's law as presented in the Christian Bible&quot;, do you still think this is
<br>
on-topic for the Extropians list?  Should we try to figure out how to apply
<br>
law to God's plan?  Should we debate whether immigrations, interracial
<br>
dating, gays in the military violate God's law or not?  Should we debate the
<br>
merits of their call to retake the US government and reinstitute God in His
<br>
rightful place as ruler of our nation?  Although the article seemed
<br>
reasonable at first, it actually is trying to spread Theocracy memes for the
<br>
US government.  As such, it seems to be off topic.
