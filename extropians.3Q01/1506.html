<p>Your theory is that in the four decades we have had these missiles,
<br>
not one person has ever thought of using chaff, then you were born?
<br>
Given the number of dollars that have been invested in hit-to-kill
<br>
technology, do you suppose there have never been tests of chaff,
<br>
flares and decoys?  Do you suppose that the results of these tests
<br>
would be unclassified?  Are you proposing a massive government
<br>
conspiracy to waste money?  This is quite absurd, John.
<br>
<p>If the bad guys did manage to spoof the EKV interceptor with chaff or
<br>
some other decoy, this material does not reenter with the same
<br>
signature as the warhead.  The THAAD missile, which strikes in
<br>
the upper atmosphere, would not be fooled.
<br>
<p>Raytheon goofed.  Now they need to go fix their system.  spike
