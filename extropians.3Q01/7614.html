</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;war&quot; has been declared on us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Blah blah. By the same logic, we should have been moderate with Japan,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since they claimed they were only 'defending' themselves against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trade embargo we had imposed on them prior to Dec 7th, and we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been 'moderate' with the Nazis, since they claimed that they were

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Versailles treaty, and were, according to them, dealing with 'criminal'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elements (jews and communists) that had contributed to Germany's defeat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See what happens to open minded people? Their brains fall out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>See what happens to close minded people?  They draw highly inaccurate
<br>
parallels and get somewhat insulting of those who think differently.  It
<br>
obviously is quite important to recognize what it is that we do that
<br>
provokes terrorists activities and a great deal of hate toward this
<br>
country.  Some of it is for our virtues, true enough.  But more than
<br>
a little is also for our faults, especially faults of policy and of
<br>
action.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just because someone showers you with their counterclaims that they say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justifies their hatred of us doesn't mean you have to listen to them, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they are in any way right. No nation is innocent. You can always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come up with a laundry list of offenses that one nation has committed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against another to justify any action you wish to take. 
</em><br>
<p>If we cannot admit where there are valid claims against us and 
<br>
act to correct such things where possible then we are irresponsible
<br>
and dishonest as a nation and as individual citizens of that nation.
<br>
And no, I don't think you can justify anything and everything according
<br>
to the wrongs.  I also don't think you can afford a policy of acting 
<br>
as if it doesn't matter because there is some bad in all nations, if 
<br>
that is what you believe.  
<br>
<p>I personally find it quite disturbing when Bush said that other
<br>
countries are either with us and by implicaiton with our policies in 
<br>
our &quot;war on terrorism&quot; or are with the terrorists.  That is a very
<br>
dangerous and blatantly false dichotomy.  One can be very much 
<br>
against terrorism and still not believe the planned and proposed
<br>
actions are reasonable and not back them.  The same is true of
<br>
nations.  Just because we have been hurt badly is not an excuse for
<br>
polarizing the world into &quot;for US&quot; and &quot;against US&quot;.
