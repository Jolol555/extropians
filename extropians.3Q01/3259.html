<em>&gt; It's called irony mate.
</em><br>
<p>So it is. Can you dish it out but not take it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What does that have to do with blacks being convicted more? Nothing,

<em>&gt; &gt; recourse. I went in for the college money (the GI Bill), which they
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Boy, you do have a chip on your shoulder.
</em><br>
<p>If being annoyed with the reverse-racism demanded and enforced in this
<br>
country for decades by the Dems and their minions that biases against
<br>
those of us who are white males not born into wealth a chip, then it's a
<br>
chip. Does that make it wrong to have a chip?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Whites also don't join the military in similar numbers because whites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tend to have a higher respect for higher education than blacks and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better prepared for college than blacks. In the words of black comedian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Chris Rock: &quot;Cut the 'racism' bullshit, and get off your ass.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well that's intellectual rigour, quoting a comedian.
</em><br>
<p>Quoting a black, college educated, individual who is in full agreement
<br>
with my own statements may not be intellectually rigorous, but nothing
<br>
you've ever said here can claim that either,  and besides, is your
<br>
statement illustrating a bias against the intelligence of comedians, or
<br>
is it just black ones?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not going to argue with you any more Mike, because, I've spent many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years listening to your vitriol and inability to understand the concepts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compassion or fairness, and watched many people I've admired on this list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waste countless hours on you. 
</em><br>
<p>More ad hominem completely unsupported by the facts. I fully and
<br>
completely understand the concepts of compassion and fairness. This
<br>
understanding includes the fact that virtuous behavior is not virtuous
<br>
if it is forced on a person. You seem to completely and utterly lack the
<br>
understanding of this extremely simple concept, and the virtriol with
<br>
which you seem to deny its validity, as well as the countless hours I
<br>
and others have wasted on attempting to educate you and others to its
<br>
validity shows to me that you are no longer worth wasting my effort on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's like talking to a brick wall - you never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer questions directly, you misquote, you take out of context, you set up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straw men, you come across as rude, bullying and aggressive, you have never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once been wrong about anything (irony again!). 
</em><br>
<p>Prove any of these accusations or retract them. I am agressive against
<br>
those who make false accusations against me, as I have a right to be.
<br>
<p>Since these postings are utterly without voice content, it is impossible
<br>
for my real emotions to be present in my posts, so therefore any 'rude,
<br>
bullying and agressive' behavior is entirely within your own mind. Stop
<br>
flagellating yourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm sorry if this is not how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you really are in real life and I expect you probably think you're an OK guy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself, but I honestly think as a lurker of longstanding (which you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubted in your inimitable way in an earlier post, so as to cast doubt on my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion) this list would benefit from your absence.
</em><br>
<p>If you were the lurker you claim to be, you'd have noticed the times
<br>
that I have in fact been absent from the list, and as others who were on
<br>
the list during those times have commented to me, the list tends to lose
<br>
a significant level of activity that they miss when I'm not here, as
<br>
occurs when other people here are absent as well. When I return, a large
<br>
number of people welcome me back enthusiastically in public and private.
<br>
<p>If my posting is so objectionable to you, why have you been a lurker for
<br>
so many years as you claim? Are you just a masochist? I must say that
<br>
I've never demanded anyone so rude as yourself to leave the list. Does
<br>
that make me a better person than you?
