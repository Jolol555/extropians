</em><br>
<p>Yes, certainly. There is no doubt that people generally leap to opinions
<br>
based on desires first, only later to be tempered, changed or confirmed
<br>
by reasoned argument, especially when people have made rather large
<br>
emotional investments in a given position over a protracted period like
<br>
an election cycle.
<br>
<p>What is important to look at is what measures one is willing to consider
<br>
to confirm their own emotionally vested opinion. For example, there were
<br>
many districts across the country where the GOP could potentially have
<br>
tipped the balance in their favor outside of Florida. New Mexico, for
<br>
instance, went to the democrats by a handful of votes, far closer than
<br>
the Florida election, with a few districts exhibiting rather significant
<br>
signs of voter fraud, yet the GOP chose to not contest these beyond an
<br>
initial recount. The GOP never asked that different standards of
<br>
counting votes be used than those instituted on the day of the election.
<br>
It never initiated excessive legal proceedings.
<br>
<p>For these reasons, public opinion turned in favor of the GOP and against
<br>
the Democrats because of perceptions of ethical behavior and lack of
<br>
sportsmanship. By persisting in claiming they were robbed of the
<br>
election, despite extensive recounts using the same election day
<br>
standards by independent organizations, the Democrats don't seem to
<br>
realize they lose more credibility, so polarized are they by the
<br>
propaganda generated perception that the election of Bush will destroy
<br>
the country (likely even more than people like myself felt similarly
<br>
about an election of Gore).
<br>
<p>The spoilsport antics of the rent-a-riot left wing at the inauguration
<br>
and since have continued to help Bush by casting the left as too
<br>
immature to lead, and too shrilly extremist to represent the people.
<br>
<p>This behavior demonstrates who is truly extreme and who is not. Even
<br>
with the defection of Sen. Jim Jeffords, merely months after winning
<br>
another term as a Republican, primarily due to the support of the
<br>
national GOP and after getting the GOP to support milk price supports in
<br>
the Northeast Dairy Compact in exchange for remaining in the party, you
<br>
don't see any calls by the party for a recall or resignation. A large
<br>
number of his individual contributors in Vermont demanded their money
<br>
back, which was quickly replaced by even more money from out of state
<br>
liberal sources. When a native American congressman, Ben Nighthorse
<br>
Campbell, switched from the DNC to the GOP in 1994, democrats were
<br>
calling for his recall and resignation left and right.
<br>
<p>So the question is: how far are you willing to go to support your
<br>
beliefs before you reconsider them? How much contradictory fact are you
<br>
willing to ignore before you start to doubt the validity of your
<br>
beleifs? These questions indicate the reasonableness or extremism of a
<br>
person.
