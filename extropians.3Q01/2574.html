<p>
Years ago, when I actually wasted money on pay cable services, I
<br>
remember ads for 'Showtime exclusives', as in movies that were only
<br>
available on Showtime and not on HBO. These ads were shown on the
<br>
Showtime channel. It made clear that these movies would *not* be seen on
<br>
HBO, that only Showtime subscribers could see them.
<br>
<p>The point of this was never clear to me. I didn't enjoy movies more
<br>
because HBO-only subscribers couldn't see them. I didn't cackle about my
<br>
superiority over HBO-only subscribers. Instead I wondered how much of my
<br>
subscription payment was going for making movies 'exclusive'.
<br>
<p>Once I had a job where I read a bunch of cable television trade rags.
<br>
There were some articles on how to excite consumers about pay-per-view.
<br>
Not much was said about actual content, or the idea that some people
<br>
might want to use ppv just sometimes for certain movies. It was all
<br>
about the 'excitement' of paying to watch a movie or show. Apparently
<br>
the 'excitement' aspect (or exclusivity) was lost on the consumers.
<br>
<p>Maybe this is just the way media moguls think. I guess they enjoy their
<br>
riches more knowing that others aren't as well off.
<br>
<p>Well, anyone, my point is digital scarcity as an practice session for
<br>
post-nanotech economy-of-abundance avoidance. I think any sign of a
<br>
human beginning to transcend or initiate some singularity technology
<br>
will be met by the same response we'd probably see to a second coming of
<br>
Jesus -- SWAT teams, machine guns, cruise missiles.
