<br>
<p><p>THEY 'MADE ME FEEL LIKE A CRIMINAL'
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was just having lunch in Ybor City when
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a surveillance camera captured his image.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeks later, the police show up.
<br>
<p><p><a href="http://www.sptimes.com/News/080801/TampaBay/_They_made_me_feel_li.shtml">http://www.sptimes.com/News/080801/TampaBay/_They_made_me_feel_li.shtml</a>
<br>
<p><p><p><p>TAMPA -- Rob Milliron has never married. He has never had kids, never 
<br>
been to Oklahoma.
<br>
<p>Yet three Tampa police officers went to Milliron's construction job 
<br>
site Monday and asked him whether he was wanted in Oklahoma for child 
<br>
neglect.
<br>
<p>It seems that his face wound up on a surveillance camera in Ybor 
<br>
City. News cameras captured that image. A woman in Tulsa saw his 
<br>
picture in U.S. News and World Report and called Tampa police.
<br>
<p>She said the man in the photo was her ex-husband and was wanted on 
<br>
felony child neglect charges.
<br>
<p>Turns out they had the wrong man. But the experience has turned 
<br>
Milliron into a vocal critic of the controversial surveillance system.
<br>
<p>&quot;From that picture, I was identified as a wanted person,&quot; said 
<br>
Milliron, 32, whose only previous brush with the law involved a 
<br>
marijuana possession charge when he was 19.
<br>
<p>The surveillance system uses software called Face-It and is linked to 
<br>
36 cameras throughout the Centro Ybor entertainment complex and along 
<br>
E Seventh Avenue. Images taken from the cameras are compared with a 
<br>
data base that includes wanted felons and sexual offenders.
<br>
<p>If the image is a match, officers are dispatched to question the 
<br>
person. But in this case it wasn't the system that flagged Milliron, 
<br>
but simply a woman who saw his picture with a news story.
<br>
<p>The plainclothes detective, accompanied by two uniformed officers, 
<br>
had a copy of the magazine, folded open to the page with Milliron's 
<br>
photo.
<br>
<p>After producing identification, answering the detective's questions 
<br>
and enduring curious stares and inquiries from his construction 
<br>
co-workers, a mortified Milliron went home.
<br>
<p>&quot;He was absolutely horrified,&quot; said Cheryl Toole, 32, Milliron's 
<br>
girlfriend of nine years.
<br>
<p>&quot;He said, &quot;I was surrounded by the police today,' &quot; Toole recalled. 
<br>
&quot;We were worried they'd come to our home in the middle of the night.&quot;
<br>
<p>Equally upsetting, Milliron said, was the fact that beneath his photo 
<br>
in the magazine, a headline read, &quot;You Can't Hide Those Lying Eyes in 
<br>
Tampa.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;It made me out to be a criminal,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Tampa police Detective Bill Todd, who took the call from the Tulsa 
<br>
woman and interviewed Milliron, said Milliron did not seem upset.
<br>
<p>&quot;He was laughing about it,&quot; said Todd, who spearheaded the software 
<br>
project that captured Milliron's image.
<br>
<p>Milliron's photograph was captured in June while he was on a lunch 
<br>
break in Ybor City.
<br>
<p>He didn't know it at the time, but the Police Department used his 
<br>
photo to demonstrate the system to local news media.
<br>
<p>The software costs $30,000, but is on loan for a year by its owner, 
<br>
Visionics Corp. of New Jersey, while the department decides whether 
<br>
to purchase it.
<br>
<p>Milliron's photo ran in the St. Petersburg Times June 30. A caption 
<br>
under the photo read, &quot;The man in this image was not identified as 
<br>
wanted.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Times later sold the photo to U.S. News and World Report.
<br>
<p>The software system has sparked controversy nationwide. Protesters 
<br>
say the &quot;spy cameras&quot; intrude on citizens' privacy. Mayor Dick Greco, 
<br>
however, has said the system is no more intrusive than the cameras 
<br>
found in banks and shopping malls.
<br>
<p>Milliron, who says he plans to retain an attorney, hopes the software 
<br>
system will be removed.
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't think it's right,&quot; he said. &quot;They made me feel like a criminal.&quot;
