Charlie said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You'd ascribe a libertarian streak to David &quot;more liberal than thou&quot; Brin?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yeesh! (Mind you, I've heard him talk a few times. Unless he's had a 180-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;degree conversion he is _no_ libertarian.) As for Greg Bear, he's no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;libertarian either. Small-c conservative, maybe, but again, unless he's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drifted radically out of where he used to be there's no way I can see of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;calling him a libertarian.
</em><br>
<p>Well, these comments actually strengthen the point I was making, of course,
<br>
since you're criticising a *concession* I made (as you obviously realise).
<br>
Of the B-boys, Gregory Benford is the only one I know well. He certainly
<br>
does have a libertarian streak. Perhaps I'm just projecting this onto the
<br>
others, but I realise that some of Brin's writing, in particular, is
<br>
critical of libertarianism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(Are you going to try and tell me that Ken McLeod is an objectivist? ;-)
</em><br>
<p>Nup. Though he does seem able to treat all sorts of political theories,
<br>
including Randian libertarianism with a great deal of knowledge and seeming
<br>
sympathy. Despite those Prometheus Awards that he won, I take it he is
<br>
really some kind of socialist. Is this correct? Forgive my ignorance, but
<br>
I'm not very clear on where some of the new crop of UK hard-sf writers fit
<br>
in. I even tend to get Ken McLeod mixed up with Ian McLeod. But some
<br>
excellent work has been coming out from the UK of late.
