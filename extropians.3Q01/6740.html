Thanks for the bits, Barbara.  I left the relevant bits below (what i thought was
<br>
relevant in any case).  To me, this sounds like there was no specific help for
<br>
israel before 1971 (all military aid in the form of loans (i wouldn't even
<br>
consider this aid), and it being smaller than the aid to the arab countries), and
<br>
what was there was insignificant ($277 million in 22 years comes to $10 million a
<br>
year, negligible in a military budget).  So i would say israel did ok without US
<br>
support for half the wars? (takeover, sinai, six day, war of attrition, almost
<br>
yom kipur?)
<br>

<em>&gt; I've used several sources here to minimize error. I think I've used a fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comprehensive range of viewpoints, and they all seem to agree on the basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point that Israel has always received aid from the US government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.medea.be/en/index010.htm">http://www.medea.be/en/index010.htm</a>  shows an average of $74 million per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year 1949 - 1969
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Israel has received more direct aid from the United States since World War
</em><br>
<em>&gt; II than any other country, but the amounts for the first half of this period
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were relatively small. Between 1949 and 1973, the U.S. provided Israel with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an average of about $122 million a year, a total of $3.1 billion (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually more than $1 billion of that was loans for military equipment in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1971-73) . Prior to 1971, Israel received a total of only $277 million in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military aid, all in the form of loans as credit sales. The bulk of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic aid was also lent to Israel. By comparison, the Arab states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; received nearly three times as much aid before 1971, $4.4 billion, or $170
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million per year. Moreover, unlike Israel, which receives nearly all its aid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the United States, Arab nations have gotten assistance from Asia,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and the European Community. Congress first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designated a specific amount of aid for Israel (an  &quot;earmark&quot;) in 1971.
