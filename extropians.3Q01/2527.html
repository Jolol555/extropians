<em>&gt; Mike,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem you have not had to contend with is &quot;visible difference.&quot;  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were able to assimilate (granted, I am assuming that you are &quot;white&quot;?).  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an immigrant myself (blonde hair, blue eyes = no questions asked!).  I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to assimilate into American society immediately.  Unless I tell people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I immigrated here, they have no idea.  Both you and I enjoy privileges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unknown to many people of &quot;visible-other&quot; races.
</em><br>
<p>So what? This is the norm in EVERY society around the world, and the US
<br>
is certainly not the most bigoted society. Look at Japan, China, and
<br>
many parts of europe. There are also plenty of characteristics that are
<br>
invisible that their posessors get a free pass on. Stupidity, for
<br>
example, is generally accepted. You have to prove by your words and
<br>
deeds you are an idiot before people will treat you like one (except, of
<br>
course, for the truly brilliant, who may or may not treat others
<br>
generally as idiots as a default).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Visible difference&quot; is what makes this phenomenon happen occasionally:  An
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;average (white) American-type&quot; may come up an Asian person (who may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been born here, and whose parents and grandparents may have been born here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well) and ask, &quot;Do you speak English?&quot;  I have a multicultural family,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Asian members of my family have experienced this .... as have most Asian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, from what I've heard.  The incidents may not be exactly the same,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but in that vein.
</em><br>
<p>So you think that people trying to be polite despite their lack of
<br>
exposure to 'visible-others' in their lives is racist? EXCUSE ME? I
<br>
think you need to get it through your skull that only a fraction of the
<br>
US has lived in communities where more than a tiny percentage of the
<br>
population is not white, and those they do are either the elite
<br>
performers of their ethnic groups or else they are fresh apples, right
<br>
off the boat, and don't speak much english.
<br>
<p>The city I live in is one such. In my high school of 700 students, there
<br>
were never more than 1-3 blacks attending at any one time, and a similar
<br>
level of asians and hispanics, all of whom were generally highly
<br>
assimilated and what big city minorities would call 'Uncle Toms'. The
<br>
most diversity was the 3-6 foreign exchange students each year, where
<br>
generally only the european students arrived with adequate english
<br>
skills.
<br>
<p>The other source of exposure to diversity is the tourist trade, where
<br>
people come from around the world in the fall on 'leaf peeping' tours of
<br>
the fall foliage, of revolutionary war and colonial heritage sites, etc.
<br>
Of the foreign tourists, generally the asians are the least skilled in
<br>
english, and generally perpetuate the stereotype of the inscrutible
<br>
camera toting asian tourist group. In our city, there is a small
<br>
southeast asian community of post-Vietnam refugees from Cambodia,
<br>
Vietnam, Laos, etc who are very insular, don't pick up english very
<br>
well, and stick together economically and socially.
<br>
<p>This is the community I grew up in. What bigotry there is is generally
<br>
of a manner expressed by people who have little or no personal exposure,
<br>
and relies on the bad stereotypes generated by the major media news
<br>
coverage of big city crime, which is generally committed by minorities.
<br>
When I left here for college I wasn't too concerned because I was going
<br>
to an engineering school, and there was a similar level of minorities in
<br>
my freshman class, but when I entered the Air Force, there was the
<br>
possibility of going to technical school in Buloxi, Mississippi, which I
<br>
had read was largely populated by blacks. Seeing as how my personal
<br>
opinion was based largely on the media portrayal of city crime being
<br>
primarily a black phenomenon, I was a bit concerned before I went to
<br>
basic training, but once I was in, I met and got to know a large number
<br>
of blacks and hispanics. This daily personal exposure and cohabitation
<br>
in barracks was a fast education in ethnic diversity.
<br>
<p>Since then, I still run into bigots, who dismiss my military experiences
<br>
as &quot;they're the 'good' blacks, the bad ones don't volunteer for service
<br>
where they'll have to really work&quot;, but these sorts are few and far
<br>
between, and are generally people who have no military experience to
<br>
judge by, or have lived only in big city slums where nobody trusts
<br>
anybody.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Blacks have not only had to contend with this problem of &quot;visible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference&quot; (in the context of the example above, of people attributing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain characteristics to blacks based on their race), they've also had to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contend with being chattel.  While I'm certain your people have suffered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some (as many immigrant groups have), you're not saying that the experiences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blacks have had can compare - in toto - with your ancestors' .... or are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you?  
</em><br>
<p>I am. I am half scottish, and our family was driven off its land, killed
<br>
and raped and imprisoned by the British after Culloden, to the point
<br>
that today, anyone with the last name Lorrey in the entire world is less
<br>
than 7 generations away from me, all of whom are descended from one
<br>
family forcibly transported to Nova Scotia in the early 19th century.
<br>
The Lorrey name is dead in Edinborough and in our ancestral Gordon
<br>
lands. The history of our oppression is more similar to the treatment of
<br>
the native north americans than africans, generally, if you discount the
<br>
decades of labor as serfs of British lords prior to transportation. I
<br>
suggest you study up on the other crimes of the British before you grant
<br>
exclusive rights to blacks alone. Serfdom is little different from
<br>
slavery.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I won't go over what I've written to Lee about why I think we owe something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially to blacks.  Their circumstances were - and are - above and beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything other immigrant (I'm using the term loosely here) groups have had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to live through.  We are fat-cat sitting on the backs of millions of unknown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slaves who endured harships and sorrows beyond description.  The heinousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the crime, the length of time (hundreds of years), and how all the past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misdeeds have affected and are still affecting many blacks today - there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing to compare to it.  Native Americans are another sad tale, and yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the black remains unparalled.
</em><br>
<p>Again, so what? Slavery was not exclusive to the US, and seems to be a
<br>
standard cultural characteristic of many african cultures. There's a
<br>
major article in the paper today where they are still trying to stamp it
<br>
out in Mauritania. If slavery is so normal for africans, then why are we
<br>
to be blamed for exercising a standard characteristic of their home
<br>
culture?
<br>
<p>Furthermore, can you name any other country that went to war, and where
<br>
hundreds of thousands willingly died to free slaves they had no relation
<br>
or cultural connection to?
<br>

<p>Thanks. I knew that already.
