<em>&gt;&lt;&lt; On the day, no-one from the BNP turned up (the home secretary banned

them)
<br>
<em>&gt;but over 1000 asian youths (Pakistani and Indian) came out and had

themselves
<br>
<em>&gt;a good old riot.  The police tried to break it up but were overwhealmed by

<em>&gt;the superior numbers of the rioters.  Only clever tactical skills by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;commander of the cops allowed them to clear the streets but by that time
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;riots had raged for hours and had caused a great deal of damage. &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My guess is, or question is, whether the youth from India were Hindu or
</em><br>
not,
<br>
<em>&gt;because my guess in no-and therein hangs your answer, in part, to why this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;riot happened?
</em><br>
<p>Your guess is right, none of the rioters were Hindu, they were all Muslims
<br>
of Pakistani origin (Mirpuri in the main to be precise).  I'm not sure why
<br>
you think this helps explain it though. Generally speaking the Hindu
<br>
community here in Britain has not been involved in any of the recent
<br>
disturbances, and is highly successful economically. The youths involved in
<br>
the riots, whether Asian or White, are generally from very poor
<br>
neighbourhoods. One major cause of the tension is competition between ethnic
<br>
groups for government money - each group believes the other is getting too
<br>
much at its expense. Another is the manifold side-effects of the &quot;war on
<br>
drugs&quot;. I don't believe the (nominal) religion of the rioters has anything
<br>
much to do with it. The primary cultural influence on many of these young
<br>
men is the subculture of gangsta rap - they wish they could be Tupac Shakur
