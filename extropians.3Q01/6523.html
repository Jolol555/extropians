Dear Extropians,
<br>
<p>I know that many on this list are involved in the development of new
<br>
technology.  I do volunteer work in wireless LAN at the IEEE.  There is
<br>
an email list there for the members, and I have posted the following
<br>
message there.  It also goes for folks here who work to advance
<br>
humanity.
<br>

<p>
Dear Colleagues and Friends,
<br>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for who you
<br>
are, and what you do.  I am very proud of the IEEE and our group.  Thank
<br>
you for being engineers who work for the constructive progress of human
<br>
civilization.  Thank you for joining hands around the world to do this.
<br>
Thank you for being volunteers who work to give people new means to
<br>
communicate with each other.  I especially want to thank all those who
<br>
have had a part in the development of wireless technology.  How can we
<br>
put a price on the value to a family member of speaking to loved ones
<br>
one last time?  Clearly, terrorists forgot to account for the cell phone
<br>
technology in the hands of passengers that may have resulted in the
<br>
saving of many more lives on the ground.  And email around the world is
<br>
allowing family members to reach each other beyond the capabilities of
<br>
the voice system.
<br>
<p>What you do may not show up on CNN the way it covers people digging
<br>
people out, but it has a part that makes it possible for people to dig
<br>
people out.  Thank you, again.
<br>
<p>Ken Clements
