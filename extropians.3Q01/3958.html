<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I always assumed that the Russian slang on the Moon was due to the race

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Russians and half Americans.

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, but there was a similar number of chinese people, yet there was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; total absense of chinese slang, proverbs, etc. I don't know if this was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simply something RAH overlooked, but the use of Russian slang does fit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with the desire by Heinlein and others for literary acceptance. I did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not say that he was 'pandering to leftists', but he rightly recognised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that gaining literary recognition would translate to more sales.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good grief.  Heinlein wrote straight from the heart as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the head and I doubt very much he had any intention whatsoever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of appealling to supposed reds in the literary world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Especially as he wrote in an era when the literati had very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little if any use for science fiction.  They were not his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; audience.
</em><br>
<p>If you have not already, I suggest you read &quot;Grumbles from the Grave&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Heinlein is also infamous as the original libertarian sci-fi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; author.  No other sf author of the time wrote so elogquently for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the importance of and rights of the individual beyond any State.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To accuse RAH of cozying up to the Russians to be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptable to a literati that had no use for such &quot;pulp trash&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is ridiculous and an insult.
</em><br>
<p>Why is it Samantha, that after explaining myself THREE times here, you
<br>
STILL don't get what I am saying?????
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russian slang could be part of his books simply because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russkis were there first and because they launched 10-100 times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as much stuff into space as we did over many years.  Also, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russians after WWII acquired as much (or more) of the rocket
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientist talent than the US did and pushed harder and earlier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for space exploration and conquest.  It would be very wierd if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there weren't Russian slang (at least) present in tales of near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earth space.  Its absence would betray even more bias.
</em><br>
<p>If Russia had so much influence on the Moon, then why is there not a
<br>
ComIntern office there in the novel??? KGB??? GRU??? All of these
<br>
entities would have presences on the moon if it had that degree of
<br>
influence.
<br>
<p>In the Heinlein universe in which MIAHM was written, the US beat the
<br>
USSR to the moon, and it is the UN govt that administrates it.
<br>
<p>I don't deny that it would be wierd if there were no Russian slang. My
<br>
point, which you don't seem to get, is that it is also quite wierd,
<br>
given the population of Chinese on the moon in the novel, that there is
<br>
absolutely no chinese slang in the novel. This is a major oversight.
