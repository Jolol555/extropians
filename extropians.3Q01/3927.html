</em><br>
<p>Mike, you are ignoring the fact that genetics is not part of the definition
<br>
of racism.  I can find no dictionary definition that says racism is based on
<br>
genetics.  All the definitions I can find describe racism as any attitude
<br>
that groups, distinguishes, prejudices or discriminates based on race.  Any
<br>
such grouping is racism.

<p><em>&gt; No, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did not. Recognising that members of certain cultures, as a result of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being canalized in those cultures, have predispositions toward certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activities, behavior, attitudes, etc. is NOT racist. If you think it is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your definition of racism is HIGHLY messed up.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, but you are using a revisionist definition.  I can find no dictionary
<br>
that agrees with you.  If you dispute all dictionaries and use your own
<br>
nonstandard definition for a word, it is you who have your definition all
<br>
messed up.
<br>
<p>Based on all my research, I must stand by my assertions.  The only
<br>
compromise I can make is to concede that by YOUR definition the examples you
<br>
give are not racist, while by all the DICTIONARY definitions I can find your
<br>
examples are racist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is saying &quot;Americans have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a cultural predisposition toward baseball and apple pie&quot; racist?
</em><br>
<p>No, because &quot;Americans&quot; are not a race.  If you claimed that blacks like
<br>
chicken more than whites (for any reason, genetic or otherwise), this would
<br>
be racist.  You would be grouping people's food preferences by race.
<br>
Grouping nonphysical attributes by race is racist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are these racist statements?:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;White guys can't dunk&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;White folk can't dance&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Only blacks have soul&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Jews are a gutter race&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, all these are racist.  They are all evaluations of worth based on race.
<br>
This is the definition of racism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Every one of these statements have not only been made by prominent black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaders, but are generally accepted among the black minority as true.
</em><br>
<p>If black leaders claim that whites can't dunk, whites can't dance, whites
<br>
don't have souls and that Jews are a gutter race, this is clearly racism.  I
<br>
don't see how someone could argue otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah, but liberals say that this IS, in fact, racism. For example, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recent court case actually said that these 'risky zip' policies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racist, and court cases have also ruled that banks that make loan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions (especially for mortgages and cars) even partly on zip code of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the customer are practicing racism.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know the zip-code case, but from what you describe the zip code
<br>
determinations were made without reference to race.  I would disagree with
<br>
those liberals who say it is racist  As for the bank loans, I can't imagine
<br>
what effect a person's zip code would have on their credit rating or job
<br>
status.
