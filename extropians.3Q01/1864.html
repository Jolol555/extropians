<p>&lt;&lt; Excellent point, thanks for mentioning it. Would &quot;living cohorts&quot; include
<br>
&nbsp;human-competitive AI, which would probably have co-evolved by the time
<br>
&nbsp;personality uploading becomes possible? How do we satisfy the H-CAI that
<br>
&nbsp;uploading humans is worth the trouble? &gt;&gt;
<br>
Its certainly worth the trouble if the uploaded personality, was able, as his 
<br>
human pre-cursor, in having likes and dislikes, based on experience and now, 
<br>
experiencing. Are you sure you want to ditch qualia forever? Banana icream 
<br>
may taste like shit to you, but shit would likely not taste up banana 
<br>
icecream's poor standards even. Experience matters, and the previous being 
<br>
did not like banan icecream.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;I'd definitely go along with the assertion that this would confirm
<br>
insufficient technology. Furthermore, I've doubts about a society sufficiently
<br>
advanced as to be capable of uploading human personalities missing the
<br>
immature nature of such a project. This technology would have far more
<br>
powerful uses than making a mommy proggie.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Kurzweil had a techno girlfriend as protagonist in Spiritual Machines-so 
<br>
Mommy is not far off, as a decent re-created person
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Of course Kurzweil, being a millionaire (billionaire?) would like to 
<br>
preserve
<br>
his identity. This has to do with taking it with one, after bio-death.
<br>
Uploading personality may be necessary to establish identity for legal and
<br>
financial reasons, in case heirs want to claim that the uploaded entity is (or
<br>
is not) still deserving of control of family assets. Less financially endowed
<br>
experimenters may want to be more creative and inventive in uploading their
<br>
personalities. Here the whole project may take on the air of a video game.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Money is, I suspect NOT a top-level insentive for Kurzweil, but merely an 
<br>
essentail means. Kurzweil is pretty altruistic, however lowly, that may rate 
<br>
on the Aynn Rand scale.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Being autonomous and independent thinkers, the highly advanced A.I.s may
<br>
discover that they agree with me... that personalities are not worth
<br>
uploading, because they are, after all, trivial illusions manufactured for the
<br>
sake of possessiveness, and that they are counterproductive to more highly
<br>
evolved human ideals.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Minds are as physical a phenomena as ketchup, or a galaxy swirling, or 
<br>
farting, or comming up with new cosmological theories, or fucking. Do I need 
<br>
to tell you of all people, that mind is the squirting of neurochemicals and 
<br>
the hopping of electrons? Mind is the fountainhead { (:OÞ) } of existence and 
<br>
makes experiences worthwhile, other wise your value and the value of a pebble 
<br>
at the bottom of the Marrianas Trench are the same. In other words Value 
<br>
Death (maybe thats plonkable?).
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Consider that dissatisfaction with the state of affairs in which people die
<br>
prompts the invention of uploading, yet this ironically and paradoxically
<br>
requires altering the upload such that it renders a satisfied customer, who
<br>
may, by virtue of such satisfying alerations, no longer resemble the original
<br>
(who lived with dissatisfaction).&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The satisfied customer, who, without volition of their own, and tastes of 
<br>
their own, equals an atomaton, and never a very good one. There is a qhole 
<br>
slwq of customers of this one uploaded person to be 
<br>
satisfied-personal-business-political-etc. Some are proggies-some are meaty 
<br>
foggies such as I.
