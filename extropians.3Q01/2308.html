<em>&gt; The cited essay makes some interesting points about the Moynihan/Nixon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Portland experiment, which I've been trying to chase down on the web.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More later. There are a number of thick pdf files to read...
</em><br>
<p>Great!  Thanks a lot.  It sounds a little to pat to me.  If this
<br>
experiment really happened as written, why aren't the results
<br>
better known?  Why have their been no follow-up experiments,
<br>
because surely there were particular circumstances that could
<br>
be thought to have been a fault.  In the U.S., the Democratic
<br>
domination of Congress until 1994, and the Democratic administrations
<br>
of Carter and Clinton, I would have thought, wanted to try again.
<br>
Also, why aren't there any such experiments in Australia or Europe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The general argument strikes me as empty, since in the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance GMI is meant to replace existing social security
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits and all their red tape and pettyfogging, and it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard to see why that would be worse for the soul. Is anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here genuinely arguing that dealing with bureaucrats on a weekly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basis is a *better* plan, an improving experience that should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *encouraged*? Dog give me strength.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I can speak from experience on this one.  When I was
<br>
28, I signed up for food stamps.  It was a humiliating 
<br>
experience.  I was asked to bring a certain amount of 
<br>
information for the interview, including my checkbook.
<br>
The interview was conducted by this arrogant fat slob
<br>
lady, who looked me over like a piece of trash.  (It was
<br>
her job, though, to be skeptical of all such requests.)
<br>
At one point, she went over my check book and noticed
<br>
a $100 check to my brother, and asked very suspiciously
<br>
what that was for.  (I had about six hundred dollars to
<br>
my name, but my brother was always hovering about zero,
<br>
and needed a loan.)  For some strange reason, I told her
<br>
that I couldn't remember what it was for.  I almost didn't
<br>
get the food stamps!
<br>
<p>No one feels good about doing that.  But a guaranteed
<br>
income is entirely different.  No bureaucracy, no pleas,
<br>
no nothing---the money just rolls in.  (I got off the
<br>
food stamps about six months later when I was asked
<br>
to come in for another interview!   I admit that they
<br>
know what they're doing not to get the system really
<br>
overloaded.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Brian Williams also writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; What happens to so-called minimum wage jobs?  Don't get me wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; the jobs will still be there but they will go vacant, why work for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; minimum wage when you can make the same doing nothing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are people at large so entirely swinish, so lacking in self-respect,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they will *refuse* to take a job if it's offered?  (Okay, many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are, and it might be argued that many more will become so.)
</em><br>
<p>Well, maybe I'm a swine, but I won't go work at some stupid
<br>
mind-numbing if not back-breaking job, if I can get the money
<br>
without such an ordeal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The long-term point of the GMI proposal, however, is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sooner or later plenty of (endurable) jobs *just won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist*.
</em><br>
<p>That's the hard question.  Just what will happen?  Why haven't
<br>
we seen anything so far (say, as compared to a 1960's economy)?
<br>
Will peculiar jobs like delivering pizza or working in Expresso
<br>
shops develop further?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the key rebuttal is surely that people in a rational GMI regime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *wouldn't* have an either/or choice. One will get the GMI payment, enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to scrape by on, and in order to improve one's lot will need to get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; menial or a CEO job, or hold up gas stations (just like now), or do open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source, or paint big-eyed babies on black velvet for tourist coins, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only lose the GMI entitlement amount paid back in tax after a sensible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threshold has been passed. 
</em><br>
<p>I dunno.  It might be better to never start &quot;taking back&quot; anything.
<br>
People get a little irrational about that.  They talk themselves
<br>
into not taking some job because they'll &quot;lose benefits&quot;, just as
<br>
you hear people irrationally whine about a getting a raise and
<br>
getting into a higher tax bracket.
