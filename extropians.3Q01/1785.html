<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Carlos, why do the locals have a problem with the guys who reap
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the spoils of the IMF/WB policies?  Seems like they would be in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;favor of these guy because they bring jobs and money into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neighborhood.  What am I missing?  spike
</em><br>
<p>This is briefly the situation in Argentina at the moment:
<br>
<p>Unemployment rate has kept very much constant during the first
<br>
years of the IMF accorded plan, then started to rise slowly but
<br>
steadily (around 15% now, I think). The economy has remained in
<br>
recession and stagnation during all this time, industrial production
<br>
has dropped horridly. The political
<br>
and bussiness class that agreed to said plan under the Menem administration
<br>
has plundered the nationaltreasury shamelessly. It was in fact difficult to
<br>
find any part of their government in which corruption, bribes, &quot;fixing&quot;
<br>
contracts, and simply criminal activities pursued from the comforts of
<br>
public office hasn't been the daily routine.
<br>
<p>The previous president (Menem) is currently under arrest
<br>
and waiting trial for arms trafficking, and it is quite possibly that
<br>
he will also be prosecuted for drug money laundry, drug trafficking,
<br>
taking bribes for making sure selected companies were granted the
<br>
privatized ex-state companies, and who knows what else. Several of
<br>
his ministers and the ex-chief of the army are also processed/arrested
<br>
on the same charges. The IMF basically ignored the corruption
<br>
and the debacle (these guys never had a real economic program beyond
<br>
privatization of everything in sight, as fast as possible and for
<br>
whatever price offered, with a few miraculous exceptions), as long
<br>
as the government carried on their short-term ideas of the moment. The only
<br>
winning parties have been local or foreign new monopolies, that have
<br>
built on the privatizations of ex-state-owned companies.
<br>
<p>On top of this complete mess in herited by them on assuming office,
<br>
the current administration is made up of a bunch of incompetent
<br>
old-school politicians who lack both the guts to face the problem,
<br>
and any knowledge of how to solve it. During the past few weeks, the
<br>
situation has become so terminal that the government is planning to
<br>
fix a &quot;zero deficit&quot; policy, and only pay for those things that can
<br>
be afforded after taxes are accounted every month. No loans, either
<br>
foreign or from the local banks, can be obtained anymore, as nobody
<br>
believes the country can go anywhere but to a debt default and
<br>
the collapse of most state services and budgets. Social unrest, strikes
<br>
by the state workers, and protests by unemployed people are spreading
<br>
fast as a reaction to this last ditch program. State workers wages are
<br>
expected to be reduced around 15% starting now, and further reductions
<br>
are very possible as the state tax collection system is a swiss cheese
<br>
and also corrupt to the core. As most of the reduced wages were already
<br>
very low, you will have all of a sudden a lot of people that will lack
<br>
the money to provide the essentials to their families. I think that when
<br>
these people realize their situation when they get their next paychecks,
<br>
things are probably going to get very nasty.
<br>
<p>-C.
