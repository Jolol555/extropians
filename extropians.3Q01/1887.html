Felix Ungman said
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The principle of limited liability corporations is central to capitalism, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and cannot/shouldnt be abandoned even in an minarchist state.
</em><br>
<p>Good try, but not so. :-)
<br>
<p>Felix, it is quite possible to have capitalist acts (exchanges of goods, 
<br>
services, money) without restriction, yet make no provision for limited 
<br>
liability corporations. The truth of the matter is merely: &quot;The principle of 
<br>
limited liability corporations is central to mercantilism.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When starting a company you need both an idea and some starting capital. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Often, the investor is not the same person as the entrepreneur (and is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;usually not involved in running the company). The basic principle of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corporate act is that the investor may loose the amount of money initally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invested, but not more that that. He is not held responsible for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;company's actions.
</em><br>
<p>We all understand how it works. How is it *justified*? The investor is 
<br>
getting money back if the thing makes a profit. Why isn't s/he jointly and 
<br>
severally stuck with liability for the company's torts and breaches of 
<br>
contract? (Actually, this *would* be the situation at common law.) Why 
<br>
should the government be able to pass a law allowing the investor to limit 
<br>
the risk?
<br>
<p>Maybe if there were no such laws, one approach to get *some* of the benefits 
<br>
of a corporation would be for the entrepreneur, a natural person, to simply 
<br>
borrow money from various investors and remain liable for the full loss. But 
<br>
this assumes that the investors are not actually trading, they are just 
<br>
creditors - just bankers. This is not a corporation. There is still a 
<br>
natural person with full liability, unattractive as that may be to 
<br>
entrepreneurs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Corporations are legal entities that should exist in minarchist states. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They are based on contracts between the corporation and the state, just as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any other first class citizen of that state.
</em><br>
<p>(1) where does the state get the moral authority to enter into such 
<br>
contracts? Why isn't it restricted to making contracts for the purposes of 
<br>
running the military and the police force (and a minimal court system)? If 
<br>
the government passes a law that says I can't get the full amount that the 
<br>
members of a trading association owe me, isn't this theft of my chose in 
<br>
action against the members of the trading association? If I disagree with 
<br>
such a law being passed, but the government passes it anyway, haven't I been 
<br>
coerced? How can this law be imposed on an unwilling minority who disagree 
<br>
with it? Anyway, where does the state get the right to create laws that are 
<br>
not unanimously accepted by its citizens? Don't tell me that the *majority* 
<br>
agree with the laws in question, because that could be the case with many 
<br>
other laws that libertarians oppose. A *majority* has no right to hold a gun 
<br>
at my head and take away my chose in action. How do you distinguish what 
<br>
laws the government can pass without unanimity and what laws it cannot pass? 
<br>
In short, what is your theory of political obligation, or government 
<br>
legitimacy? What size and shape of state is allowed by underlying ethical 
<br>
principles? What kinds of laws am I obliged to obey? What are the necessary 
<br>
and sufficient conditions before I and the state are obliged to recognise 
<br>
something as your property?
<br>
<p>(2) Felix, what do you mean &quot;just as any other first class citizen of that 
<br>
state&quot;? *I* sure wasn't created by a contract with the state. As far as I 
<br>
know, my parents used a totally different method! I find this very puzzling. 
<br>
Have you left something out here, perhaps?
<br>
<p>Hey, folks, keep those defences of corporations coming.
<br>
<p>Cheers
<br>
<p>Russell
