<p>Hi Muad'Dib! ;-)
<br>
<p>Actually, I think this scheme is unlikely to work unless you really
<br>
start messing with the motivational systems of people. I think it is
<br>
extremely hard to provide a pleasure that can beat imagination, so
<br>
showing people paradise might actually put them off. &quot;Sure, the houris
<br>
are wonderful and I love the wine, but it is not *quite* as lovely as I
<br>
had thought...&quot; - you can likely control people better by giving them
<br>
wague glimpses they can fill in with their longing instead. In fact, I
<br>
doubt it is useful to even have that cyberparadise, because you don't
<br>
want to have nearly-content departed ones writing home...
<br>
<p>As for religious singularities, I think the invention of monotheism was
<br>
one of them. That was a great invention, since it sharpened the memetics
<br>
of religion quite a bit. Before, you had to convince others that your
<br>
favorite god was really great and that they had to worship him *too*.
<br>
Now you could instead convince them that there was only *your* god, and
<br>
all other gods were wrong - a bit harder at first, but once a person is
<br>
converted he is firmly converted and less likely to defect. Add the
<br>
socioeconomics of monotheism, and you have a recipe for singularity.
