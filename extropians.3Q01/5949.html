Dr. Krick pioneered observational long-term weather forecasting and ground
<br>
generator cloud seeding.  Inertia and the &quot;weather bureaucracy&quot; have relegated
<br>
his work to the proverbial dusty Smithsonian basement.
<br>
<p>Anyone having further information on Dr. Krick and his work please send me an
<br>
e-mail.  Dr. Krick died in 1996.

Following information is compiled from various sources including my own review.
<br>
<p>Subj: Irving Krick (Weather Wizard)
<br>
Original message (now edited for completeness) sent to
<br>
NOAA et al in Feb 97:
<br>
<p>Just finished reading a book about the career of Irving P. Krick,
<br>
long-range weather forecasting, and cloud seeding.
<br>
_STORM, Irving Krick vs. the U.S. Weather Bureaucracy_ by Victor
<br>
Boesen.  I found it a very good read.  Krick was/is ahead of his time.
<br>
This is just the sort of science dogma that Charles Fort railed about
<br>
over 60 years ago.
<br>
<p>Krick's forecasts were 85 per cent accurate out to two years.  For
<br>
example, he predicted the general weather for both the second
<br>
Eisenhower and Kennedy inaugurations in 1957 and 1961.
<br>
His rain making and hail reduction jobs between about 1950 and
<br>
1977 involved two million generator hours (silver iodide) in 29 U.S.
<br>
states, seven provinces in Canada, Mexico, Central America,
<br>
the West Indies, Spain, France, the Alps, Italy, Sardinia, Israel,
<br>
Syria, North Africa, and the Congo.  The U.S. Weather Bureau
<br>
fought his long-range weather forecasting and cloud seeding efforts
<br>
and results through Congressional censure, public censure, control
<br>
of the media, etc.  I'm flabbergasted by the scope of U.S. Weather
<br>
Bureau attempts to control him.
<br>
<p>Quoting Tom Birchard in Hawaii:  &quot;Well, I don't know a whole lot
<br>
about Irving P. Krick except that he was the chief meteorologist who
<br>
called the day for the Normandy Invasion.......i.e. D-DAY!  What a
<br>
gutsy forecast that was... basically catching the opposition
<br>
off-guard because their meteorologists were saying that we would never attack
<br>
with the forecast conditions.  Irving P. Krick is/was a member of Tau
<br>
<p>Kappa Epsilon (TKE) International Fraternity and I love to ask our
<br>
new members about this famous man.....Anyway, that is about
<br>
all I know about that....This extra-terrestrial weather thing...is he
<br>
implying that our Moon and other planets are having some sort of an
<br>
effect on our weather?? Very interesting, as I was recently involved
<br>
in a discussion with a friend recently on the very same
<br>
topic...Aloha.&quot;
<br>
<p>OBIT:  Pasadena, Calif. (AP) -- Irving P. Krick, a meteorologist who
<br>
helped determine crucial weather conditions for the invasion of
<br>
Normandy, died June 20 (1996).  He was 89.  Krick founded the
<br>
meteorology department at California Institute of Technology.
<br>
He left Caltech as an Army colonel to run a U.S.-British meteorology
<br>
team ordered to find a three-day stretch of calm weather for the
<br>
invasion.  [...]  Krick left Caltech again in 1948, to devote full
<br>
energy to his consulting firm, Irving P. Krick Associates.  Though he sold
<br>
the firm to Strategic Weather Services six years ago (1990), he stayed
<br>
involved as chairman emeritus.

Forwarded privately from Mr. X in April 2001:
<br>
<p>Here are some recent news items concerning Irving Krick.

<p>Also, here is an abstract:
<br>
<p>Lewis, J.M., 1994: Caltech's program in meteorology: 1933-1948. Bulletin
<br>
of the American Meteorological Society, 75(1), 69-81. 
<br>
<p>The California Institute of Technology established a course of study in
<br>
meteorology in 1933. It was intimately tied to the upsurge of activity
<br>
in commercial and military aviation that occurred in the period between
<br>
the world wars. The tragic crash of the airship U.S.S. Akron provided
<br>
the stimulus for including meteorology as a sub-program in the
<br>
aeronautics department at Caltech. Theodore von Kármán, head of the
<br>
department and director of the school's Guggenheim Aeronautics
<br>
Laboratory, masterminded the design of the program and geared it toward
<br>
the solution of practical problems using the principles of dynamic
<br>
meteorology. One of his doctoral students, Irving Krick, was groomed to
<br>
develop the program. Robert Millikan, head of the Institute, fostered an
<br>
approach to science that encouraged the faculty to consult and work with
<br>
industry. In this environment, Krick established links with aviation,
<br>
motion picture studios, and public utilities that would set the stage
<br>
for the research thrust in meteorology. The program was primarily
<br>
designed for training at the master's degree level and a significant
<br>
number of the graduates became entrepreneurs in meteorology. Based on
<br>
letters of reminiscence and oral histories from some of these consulting
<br>
meteorologists, it has been concluded that the Millikan/von Kármán
<br>
philosophy of science played an important part in directing the
<br>
meteorologists into the private sector. Following World War II, Lee
<br>
DuBridge replaced Millikan as head of the Institute. DuBridge's efforts
<br>
were directed toward making the small elite school scientifically
<br>
competitive in the changed conditions of a postwar world. In this
<br>
climate, the merging of private business with academic work fell into
<br>
disfavor. And without champions such as Millikan and von Kármán, the
<br>
meteorology program was unable to survive.
