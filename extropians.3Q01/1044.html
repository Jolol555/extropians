<p>
Amara,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your patience and for your well-expressed ideas and
<br>
way of living life.  I greatly admire you and I'm very glad you
<br>
are here. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To the hard-core deconstructionists out there, I suggest going out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and playing music or dancing or using some other means to turn off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your deconstructionalist tendencies. Please remember that we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different value systems, different 'true' and 'untrue', different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences and so on. I don't agree that deconstructing the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with science yields all answers possible. There are other ways to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn and discover too.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  That would be wonderful to get across.  With the ramp
<br>
toward Singularity continuously rising humanity faces its
<br>
deepest challenges and its greatest opportunity.  It is strange
<br>
to me that we would even consider facing this with only
<br>
science.  It will take the fullness of what we are and then
<br>
some.  Life always does, but especially now when literally
<br>
everything for everyone rides on what we choose, how we choose
<br>
and how we treat one another.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you tell me that you know all that is in your subconscious? Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you learn from everything you can of what's around you? Have you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used every tool that seems useful in order to know? Do you find joy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and wonder and wisdom in what's around you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sometimes I feel so much of it that I am &quot;in danger&quot; of blissing
<br>
totally out. &lt;g&gt;  I would give anything to turn people on to
<br>
just that.  No dogma or doctrine, just that joy, wonder and
<br>
wisdom.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Lee was originally asking questions for definitions, so I did my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolute best to find words (which mostly don't exist) to explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some perspectives. He or J.R. can choose to accept it or not, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask questions to try to understand the different perspectives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better, but I must say that I was horrified and very dissapointed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear the immediate knee-jerk condemnations &quot;False&quot; that my way to try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see what was in my subconscious to gain wisdom, be open to learn from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my environment, trying to bring me to a higher awareness  with what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life had to offer me. I don't find it 'false' at all that life has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a richness that I can't explain, and I'm doing my best to explore it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and learn about it in every way available to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>May your exploration always take you deeper into this incredible
<br>
beauty and joy and may it deeply nourish you and those around
<br>
you.
<br>
&nbsp;
