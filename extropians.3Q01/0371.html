<p>Normally, yes. However, at least in California, and according to the
<br>
stats I've seen, over 40% of California's power demand over the past 10
<br>
years has been conserved. There is little room left for improvement, and
<br>
such improvement is usually in the most expensive to conserve areas.
<br>
Perhaps you can provide an impression for how much fluorescent is used
<br>
in people's homes there, to indicate how much savings can occur further.
<br>
I'd expect with that much already conserved that they'd already be
<br>
pretty popular.
<br>
<p>I think one of the best things that people can do is to eliminate their
<br>
traditional tower PCs in favor of laptops and flatscreen displays. PC's
<br>
use between 150-225 watts, plus a similar amount for the CRT, printer,
<br>
scanner, etc. A 4 hour a day PC habit can result in 2 kWh consumption
<br>
per day, or 730 kWh per year (not counting the lighting requirements for
<br>
using a PC). Multiply that by 10 million people, and thats 7.3 terawatt
<br>
hours per year for PC use alone. Dropping that down to 20 watts for a
<br>
laptop for everybody means a reduction in consumption of 96%. Equipping
<br>
them with solar panels for those laptops would only help with another
<br>
4%. As you can see, the key to savings in computers is moving to lower
<br>
internal operating voltages.
