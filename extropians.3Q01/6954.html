----- Original Message -----
<br>
From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Das%20Elend%20des%20Transhumanismus%20(Was:%20Is%20genocide%20the%20logical%20solution?)&In-Reply-To=&lt;001d01c13fe2$a95281c0$c8c8f418@southmount.com&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To make this charge of an &quot;ideological twin&quot; stick Anders would need to
</em><br>
show
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at least (a) that transhumanism is necessarily deontological in
</em><br>
structure,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and (b) that Robert intended the consequence to be weighted is that of
</em><br>
an
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ideal, namely, the singularity, rather than the lives that the
</em><br>
singularity
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will save. However, (a) is an open question in my mind and, as I've
</em><br>
said,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Robert's discussion seems predicated on the assumption that the
</em><br>
singularity
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will save a great number of lives. That is, it is to misunderstand (or
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; read carefully) the form of Robert's argument:  the singularity is the
</em><br>
means
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the end of saving lives, it is not that sacrificing lives are the
</em><br>
means
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the goal of the singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I was referring to here was not whether the detailled internal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical structure of fascism would be isomorphic with debased
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism, but to point out that once that line was crossed, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resulting ideology would be for all practical purposes the same.  And I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did not use the term fascism just to tar Robert (who I deeply respect in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other areas) but because I really saw the similarity between a &quot;humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as means for the singularity&quot; transhumanism and a &quot;humans as means for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the national community&quot; fascism. Even if Robert thinks the reason the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity is good is because it somehows limits dying, that is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very different from the more practical minded fascist (and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collectivist) ideas that view the &quot;national community&quot; as involving a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better life for everybody.
</em><br>
Quite frankly this seems to be quite a stretch. Surely there is a morally
<br>
significant difference  between saying that we ought to sacrifice lives in
<br>
order to save more lives, and (with the fascist) that we ought to sacrifice
<br>
some lives so that those who remain may enjoy a better life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What would your opinion be on a fascist transhumanist (not Robert in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocating the singularity as a good any sacrifice might be worth? What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would your *ethical* arguments against his position be?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Obviously this is not the sort of question which can be adequately addressed
<br>
in this sound-bite philosophical forum. Fascists usually hold either that
<br>
there are no moral truths (the error theory) or that moral truths are
<br>
relative. As Mussolini said, fascism is relativism in practice. Obviously
<br>
once one thinks morals are relative one is only left with the &quot;aesthetic&quot;
<br>
question of whether they should be relativized to a culture, a state, a
<br>
social class (as in some versions of Marxism) or race. I believe that there
<br>
are moral truths and that they are not relative so obviously there is a
<br>
large gap between myself and fascists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem here is not that Robert is wrong or made an inflammatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post, but that in the current list culture there is precious few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempts to shore up the ethics of transhumanism in a way that makes it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workable and protects it against merging with unpalatable and dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideologies. If transhumanism has no generally accepted core ideas and no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics, what is there to distinguish it from (say) technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fascism? That is why I more and more think we have to abandon the term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism as a designator for ourselves and instead concentrate on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more well-defined systems such as extropianism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I agree. 'Transhumanism' is too broad in its scope. It allows under its
<br>
umbrella individuals (such as yourself) who I admire and agree with in the
<br>
main, and more unsavory types like the fascist transhumanist you mention.
<br>
While there is much that I find congenial about extropianism, I am more
<br>
interested in a position which I call 'absolute perfectionism'. The idea,
<br>
which I have explained a bit in other posts, is to wed the perfectionist
<br>
tradition in ethics (going back to Plato and Aristotle) with the
<br>
transhumanists' interest in the malleability of human nature.
<br>
Mark.
