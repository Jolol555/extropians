<em>&gt; &gt; I think you are assuming that an individual's intelligence stays constant

</em><br>
<em>&gt;You are right. There is of course nothing about the Flynn effect itself that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dictates that it is the young getting smarter. The correlation could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entirely due to more intelligent geriatrics. But as you know, there is other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evidence that intelligence increase with the year of birth,
</em><br>
<p>There are two models I had in mind:
<br>
IQ = Year of Birth + Personal factor
<br>
IQ = Current Year  + Personal factor
<br>
Both models predict a correlation between year of birth and IQ.
<br>
And both predict the factoid Damien B. cited: &quot;Flynn showed that
<br>
the increasing raw scores appear on every major test, in
<br>
every age range and in every modern industrialized country&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes, but the areas in which the young are the most resistant to the advice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the old are the areas where knowledge should transfer the best: love,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; marriage, friends, children, careers, work ethic, institutional 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reliability,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You may be right about this--it is hard to be sure at this abstract level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But I think a lot of the items you cite here have changed drastically in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last fifty years, so I don't know what sage advice Grandpa will have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Marriages and careers are much more--how shall I put it?--fluid than they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;use to be. Very few got divorced in Grandpa's day, most get divorced now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Very few pursue their entire career with the same company today, many did in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Grandpa's day. ...
</em><br>
<p>I agree that it is possible in principle for the world to change so fast
<br>
that the knowledge of the old is irrelevant.  I just don't believe that we
<br>
live in such a world.  Shakespeare, for example, who lived hundreds of years
<br>
ago, has many useful things to tell people today about how lives are lived.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... Perhaps you'll agree that these are ultimately empirical questions.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, since it is logically possible that you are right,
<br>
I must remain open to being show so empirically.
