<p><p>Sure.  I have a hard problem with that too.  But who is saying

that? Certainly not I or anyone else I have heard here.  Whether
<br>
it takes 5 years or 5 centuries you have to create and sustain
<br>
health whole people to the maximum extent you can.  That is the
<br>
only way to minimize the costs and risks of getting there
<br>
intelligently and morally.
<br>
<p>We disagree on what some of the needed values are, not on
<br>
whether strong values are necessary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Aside: In THE SPIKE I advocate measures such as guaranteed income, funded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from taxes, as a stop-gap to alleviate the worst effects of patchy poverty
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or cultural deracination, and also to help salvage those flung out of work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; due to the acceleration of technological innovations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not bitterly wedded to any precise view on all this; that is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I've said &quot;when we are rich enough then okay&quot;  (a view which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be ridiculed, and perhaps rightly so by many here), then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at that &quot;faraway&quot; time, sure, let's feed everyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Technically and economically we can feed everyone right now. 
<br>
The main barriers are all political.  Waiting until after MNT is
<br>
bullshit.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; My question for you is this:  don't you think it somewhat inappropriate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to extort money from one set of persons (those who have innocently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accumulated wealth by self-denial, hard work, talent, industry, thrift,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or service to others), and bestow it on some other people?  You're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; familiar with the libertarian view that abhors initial use of force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I'm just not familiar with what your answer would be, sorry.)  Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see this as a case of the end justifying the means?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If that was the only way to model it or was a fair and
<br>
reasonably full accounting then sure I would think it was
<br>
wrong.  However, it is not so that everyone creates their own
<br>
wealth relatively by themselves out of self-denial, hard work,
<br>
talent and industry.  Several more wide-spread societal factors
<br>
entire into the equation for many of us.  Without being in a
<br>
society that recognized certain talents, provided for education
<br>
(to some but not adequate degree) and had certain types of
<br>
economic and political frameworks in place many of us would not
<br>
have the relative amount of wealth we do.  Also, it needs to be
<br>
pointed out that the level of
<br>
expertise/intelligence/ability/training necessary to have a
<br>
truly livable wage from a traditional job is increasing.  The
<br>
level of automation of jobs formerly done by people is
<br>
increasing.  Over time there will simply not be jobs for more
<br>
and more people that they can actually do efficiently enough to
<br>
justify the paying them a living wage for the work.  In that
<br>
case what would you advise?  That these people simply starve if
<br>
they can't be trained quickly enough for the higher tech jobs?
<br>
<p><p>Do we have to wait all the way to MNT to share some of the
<br>
proceeds of our ever-expanding plenty with those who no longer
<br>
are hirable at a living wage?  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That diversion aside, I repeat: Making provision in the old-fashioned way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and inculcating the personal values appropriate to the frontier or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1930s or 1950s, looks totally pointless in a world we expect to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transformed exponentially during the immediate decades ahead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People like Bill Gates now have wealth that is on the order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 10^7 times as much as some poor person needs to sustain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life.  Maybe it would be best to wait until that figure gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to 10^12 or 10^13, because then a number of compassionate rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people will simply fund a minimal standard of living for everyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This should occur as we approach the Singularity, and we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the onerous stealing from the rich to give to the poor (by force).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>In the meantime what?  Starvation?
