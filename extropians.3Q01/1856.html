<p>&nbsp;They claim that more nuclear power would have had no effect on peak
<br>
prices. They seem to base this on two faulty assumptions. They assume
<br>
the price of natural gas would be unaffected, even though replacing
<br>
some natural gas use by nuclear would seem to reduce total demand for
<br>
natural gas. They also seem to assume that there are no cost differences
<br>
between the natural gas based producer who would be the marginal producer
<br>
with more nuclear power and the one was the actual marginal producer. It
<br>
seems likely that most producers have some costs that differ from competitors
<br>
(e.g. different labor costs due to different locations).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;They argue that in an otherwise free market, the restrictions on long-term
<br>
contracts wouldn't have affected prices.
<br>
&nbsp;They have a reasonable claim that it ought not to have affected retail
<br>
prices, but given the actual political climate it seems likely that consumers
<br>
and/or taxpayers will actually end up paying something that approximates
<br>
average prices that the utilities faced.
<br>
&nbsp;They also claim that producers who signed long-term contracts at low
<br>
prices would go bankrupt and renege on their contracts, as some who
<br>
actually signed such contracts have done. The claim that a significant
<br>
fraction would go bankrupt seems to reflect an unusual pessimism about
<br>
the reasonableness of the relevant bankruptcy laws, and/or an unusual
<br>
lack of confidence in the ability of producers to hedge their risks.
<br>
I'm fairly confident that many producers would or did sign long-term
<br>
contracts with natural gas producers, and that those natural gas producers
<br>
would have wells operating at predictable enough costs to fulfill those
<br>
contracts. My impression is that some of the actual breach of long-term
<br>
contracts to which the paper seems to be refering started when the utilities
<br>
broke the contracts by failing to pay, which would at least have been
<br>
postponed a long time if the utilities had had more such contracts.
<br>
&nbsp;They seem to imply that that long-term contracts would not have affected
<br>
the blackouts, but it sure looks to me like, given the mistaken retail price
<br>
caps, the rate at which the utilities lost money would have been drastically
<br>
reduced, possibly by enough to keep them solvent until the shortage ends.
<br>
If they had been solvent enough to pay the QFs most of what they were owed,
<br>
fewer of those QFs would have shut down due to lack of cash, and the
<br>
available QF generating capacity would have been larger. I suspect this
<br>
would have averted most of the blackouts.
<br>
&nbsp;But at least their analysis is better than the airline ticket analogy, which
<br>
suggests that spot prices will normally be much higher than long-term contract
<br>
prices (that kind of price discrimination happens in airline ticketing because
<br>
the last-minute business traveller is less price sensitive than early ticket
<br>
buyers).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Their claim that a &quot;three-year dry spell&quot; &quot;reduced hydro-electric generation
<br>
in California&quot; is misleading. California has had three years of increasingly
<br>
dry weather, but 2001 was the first of those years to actually be drier than
<br>
the historical average. Maybe if they had been talking about the west as
<br>
a whole rather than California the claim would be right.
