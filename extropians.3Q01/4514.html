&lt;I wish the store managers who stayed up nights thinking about how they
<br>
could
<br>
improve their supermarkets in order to beat the Safeway down the street
<br>
would also come up with some ideas about how best to treat farmworkers.
<br>
<p>I wish the &quot;immense concentration of knowledge [taking] place in the minds
<br>
of a few people who have an enormous incentive to improve the quality of the
<br>
stores&quot; would also develop some incentive to improve the quality of people's
<br>
lives - people who provide the basic foodstuff and products for their
<br>
stores.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You're a smart lady. Think of a way to turn a profit doing it and then
<br>
sell the idea. The reason the massive well of knowledge about the consumer
<br>
is there is because greed is good, and greed is the whip that a man will
<br>
savour as it lashs him.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure altruism never helped anyone for long. (IMHO)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And with regards to the problems of the migrants... not to be an
<br>
asshole...
<br>
but if I choose to work a job that pays more than my old one, but will
<br>
cause me to get blisters on my hands...should I expect the community to
<br>
see that my hands stay cleaned and debrided and wrapped? Why is the
<br>
implication in the story &quot;there is a problem. obviously the community (who
<br>
didn't make the choices that neccessarily lead to the problem) has to
<br>
fix it, not doing so is moraly reprehensible!&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must consider this... what would be the situation for these people
<br>
if the farmers had no jobs to offer them? Would you rather the children
<br>
eat or have them have daycare by a parent? Perspective here is important.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
