<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You know... this one has always bugged me.  I used

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You used to be one? Is there a surgical procedure

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;smile&gt;  Not yet... but there is one you can get to be

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Gee, Loree, I don't know your wife at all, so I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can't make any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pronouncements, but do you think possibly it may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because you are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better thinker/worker than she was in the job? How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; did your and her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evaluations compare?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thinking we are about the same on... I might have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slight edge.  She has a better education (BA) and as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worker, she is definitely superior.  I am a bit more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creative.  All in all things balanced out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe her evaluations were better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Did you notice any changes when you became not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; white male?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But you didn't answer my question.  Has your life been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impacted personally by affirmative action (e.g. did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you not get into the school of your choice, loose out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a job or promotion simply because you were a white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; male?)
</em><br>
<p>I:
<br>
a) lost out on an appointment to a military academy
<br>
b) lost out on financial aid in college, which was biased to provide
<br>
more aid to people of the same economic level if they were minorities.
<br>
c) am constantly accused of being a racist/sexist/'rich elite' simply
<br>
because I am a white male.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most men don't recognize male privilege, most whites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't recognize white privilege.  Having been both man
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and woman, and having been married to two different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethnic minorities and lived in ethnically diverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; urban communities most of my life, I have seen both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with my own eyes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the 70's, 80's and 90's it's possible that the PC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crowd over did things... but equality of opportunity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for blacks and whites is still mostly a myth white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people tell themselves.
</em><br>
<p>In my experience, the only lack of opportunity that blacks I've known
<br>
have had has been produced by their own memetic programming, and not by
<br>
the system. When you are programmed to expect racism, that is exactly
<br>
what you will get.
