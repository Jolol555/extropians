<em>&gt; &gt; We have tar balls wash up on shore.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you know for a fact that those tar balls do not come from natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seepage?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Our wetlands management officials have become very proficient in
<br>
tracing the sources of water contaminants to their source and proving it.
<br>
Florida has very strict water contamination laws and can now force polluters
<br>
to pay for the cleanup costs.  Of course, the polluters always claim it's
<br>
not them, so the state has to prove in a hearing that the pollution has been
<br>
traced to a specific company.  Therefore, they not only identify the type of
<br>
contaminant, but identify chemical markers that point to a specific company
<br>
or a specific location.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; We have bacteria blooms.
</em><br>
<p>Not here.  The wastewater management authority can measure the bacteria
<br>
blooms and the water to determine what caused it.  Typically, specific kinds
<br>
of chemicals and wastewater will result in different bacteria blooms.  By
<br>
measuring the chemical composition of the water, they can match it to the
<br>
particular wastewater plant that leaked.  They also get heavy fines to pay
<br>
for the cleanup.  One of my brothers is in the wastewater business, and he
<br>
frequently works with officials to determine if specific bacteria or algae
<br>
blooms come from any of the plants that he manages.  He must provide
<br>
chemical records for what has recently been used at the plant to identify a
<br>
chemical &quot;fingerprint&quot; to identify or exonerate each particular plant.  Most
<br>
of our bacteria problems are traced to wastewater leakages and accidents.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; According to sources, there is more oil pollution from natural seepage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than from leaks from oil drilling and transport.
</em><br>
<p>Any studies not funded by the oil companies that show this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; We didn't have to do this when I was a kid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And back in the 'good old days', nobody knew about these things, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people just died for the same reasons that were attributed to other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sources that people were aware of.
</em><br>
<p>You don't give oldtimers enough credit, Mike.  When peoples start dying for
<br>
no reason, it is easy to figure out that all the dead people ate the same
<br>
thing before they died.  Fishing communities and clamming communities are
<br>
aware of their environment.  They know if something is wrong with the fish.
<br>
Also, people don't just die suddenly for no reason.  Bad mussels or bad fish
<br>
will make a lot of people sick, and it is easy to figure out that they ate
<br>
something bad.  Your theory that maybe nobody noticed this stuff before
<br>
might be a good conjecture, but I don't think it holds up to investigation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I remember when the Androscoggin River up in northern NH was colored
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orange and smelled to high heaven from pulping operations in Berlin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Between the mill and the hydro station downstream in Berlin, there would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be 1-3 feet of suds on top of the orange water, and when the wind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shifted direction, those on the west side of the river received the full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brunt of the stink of the mill (which is why nobody lives on the east
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side of the river). The mill spewed out a terrible orange/brown plume of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smoke that could be seen from 20 miles away (and smelled from that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distance).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today, the mill is still in operation, but the river is no longer the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mess it once was. It is clear and smells fine. The mill still smells
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the smell of rotting bark and the bleaching of pulp inside, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; river is now a fine place to do fly fishing, and there are no worries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about them being toxic. The mill only emits a slight plume of white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steam, and they've stopped shipping logs down the river, everything is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by truck now. Atlantic salmon are back in migration in the watershed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now, as their spawning streams are protected from streamside logging,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and erosion controls are used.
</em><br>
<p>Wonderful example, Mike.  I hate to ask, but did the Mill clean up its own
<br>
act by itself, or did the government or public have to pressure them to do
<br>
so?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for my local area here in Lebanon, I've got pictures from early in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 20th century when there would be log jams miles long on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Connecticutt river. They would scour out the beds of the river of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life, and wipe out bridges as well. Today, there are no such log
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shipments, and everyone gets in a tizzy if someone's riverbank collapses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from natural erosion.
</em><br>
<p>All true.  But are these examples of why we shouldn't worry about pollution?
<br>
Or are these examples of how bad it was before we started worrying about it?
