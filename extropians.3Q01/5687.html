<p>What? You're selling real estate for the government now? ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; with a layer of fresh ink drying in my passport, I figured

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hide their inkpads. 
</em><br>
snip..
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So next time you have an opportunity to be within hand's reach of one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of those rectangular-tin-boxes-that binds-this-country together,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practice one of your Penn and Teller magic tricks and hide the ink
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pad. Please do your part to help this world be ink-pad-free.
</em><br>
<p>I love it Amara! Here's another idea: come up with a chemical substance
<br>
that causes the ink in the pads to dry up, gel, fossilize, whatever.
<br>
That way, you go around with a little squirt gun, squirting pads, and
<br>
they THINK that they still have their ink pads, but they are really no
<br>
good. If enough people keep doing this, you'll run the government into
<br>
bankruptcy with the largest budget item being inkpads, and the inkpad
<br>
manufacturers will get the blame....
<br>
<p>That way, they can't nail anybody by declaring unauthorized posession of
<br>
an inkpad a felony.
