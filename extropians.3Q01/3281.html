<em>&gt; There's a great article in the new issue of _The_Economist_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (August 2 issue) by Bjorn Lomberg, the former Greenpeace-type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environmentalist who, in trying to debunk Julian Simon, wound up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding a new perpective on environmental issues himself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The article is re-printed in its entirety at this link on Economist.com:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=718860">http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=718860</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Is this the same Bjorn Lomberg who wrote &quot;The Structure of Solutions in the
<br>
Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma&quot; and other political tomes in the &quot;Center for
<br>
International Relations Series&quot;
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/102-3142263-8339311">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/102-3142263-8339311</a>&gt;?
<br>
This series seems to be specifically aimed at publishing statistical data to
<br>
support specific political viewpoints.  I don't know how political either
<br>
the old book or the new book is.  Has anybody seen either one?  Are they
<br>
more scientific than political?
<br>
<p>The article in the Economist gave the position pretty well, but it didn't
<br>
give any supporting references.  I could tell that Bjorn Lomberg says that
<br>
the UN statistics are wrong and that his are right, but I couldn't find a
<br>
specific reason why he claims this.
<br>
<p>I did notice that most of Lomberg's points did not directly contradict
<br>
environmentalists.  If you read carefully, he seems to agree that most of
<br>
the environmental claims are really problems, but he claims that GreenPeace
<br>
exaggerated all of the problems out of proportion.  The real problems are a
<br>
small fraction of the claimed problems.  This may be good and may give us
<br>
more time, but it might indicate that the problems are not nonexistent.  I
<br>
almost wonder if this will turn out to be a pro-environmentalist tome, but
<br>
at a much more realistic level of science without all the hype.
<br>
<p>In any case, it should be interesting.  I would love to hear any feedback
<br>
from anyone who knows more.
