<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Dead certain&quot;?  Obviously, I have to be much less certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that there is something wrong with how they think, than I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; am that what they think is wrong.  Suppose that someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; adamantly believes that NASA's people walking on the moon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was a hoax.  I'm 99.9% convinced that they're wrong.  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only about 80% convinced that there is something wrong with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *how* they think.  But what else am I supposed to think?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Giving no brain examples that have nothing at all to do with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity of the topic at hand and with the richness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spiritual believes strikes me as a dishonest (intentionally or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not) tactic.  It belittles by the implication that spirituality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is equally as odious through and through as morons who think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walking on the moon was faked.
</em><br>
<p>Samantha, J.R. and I were trying to describe each
<br>
separate category of religious attitude separately
<br>
when we wrote some of the things we did.  This was
<br>
in reference to people that you might consider
<br>
religious fundamentalists.  Please don't
<br>
think that it is implied that what is true of
<br>
some religious people is necessarily true of
<br>
all religious people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Suppose that I have a computer program that gives what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think is a 99.9% chance of being a wrong answer.  I simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; MUST entertain the hypothesis that there is something wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with the program.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another poor and off-topic analogy that obscures far more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it clarifies.  Why not just say you don't want to engage this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question further?  Because you sure aren't really engaging it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with this type of response.
</em><br>
<p>True!  I just don't have time, really.  I really do intend
<br>
to continue the discussion of spirituality and so forth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There comes a point in disagreeing with people who seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reality challenged that one cannot be blamed for inquiring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as to why they are so bad at understanding the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is precisely because I am not reality challenged that I must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider spirituality and in some ways embrace it.  Reality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including those aspects most consider spiritual, has butted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heads with me a few times to many to do otherwise.   Do you take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into account that I just might be just as deeply honest and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every bit as much integrity as you do despite the fact I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some things differently than you?
</em><br>
<p>Of course you do!   This has just been a terrible miscommunication.
<br>
Evidently in our efforts at rather Aristotelian classification of
<br>
all people who claim religious beliefs---and hence our effort to
<br>
be as correct as possible---we, or at least I was having difficulty
<br>
talking about, as evolved in the discussion J.R. and I were having,
<br>
the case of people who, say, belief everything in the bible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I am mistaken you have given me no grounds for seeing that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am here.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, exactly so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If anything you seem to be clinging harder to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position that those who affirm some parts of religion or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spirituality are damaged in their thinking processes.
</em><br>
<p>My claim is vastly broader than that.  Anyone who is 
<br>
sufficiently reality challenged---again not anyone on
<br>
this list---I simply begin at some point to wonder
<br>
what is wrong or damaged in their ability to think.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You also seem to have some difficulty seeing (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admitting anyway) that this position is a tad extreme.
</em><br>
<p>My examples were a tad extreme, because I was trying
<br>
to be comprehensive, that's all.
