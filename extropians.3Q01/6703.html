<p>14 September  2001    Why? An attempt to explain the unexplainable
<br>
<p>By Rahul Bedi, Jane’s correspondent in New Delhi
<br>
<p>The origins of last Tuesday’s attack on the United States arguably have
<br>
their roots in the 1970s. At this time, during the height of the Cold War,
<br>
a Washington shamed by defeat in Vietnam embarked on a deep, collaborative
<br>
enterprise to contain the Soviet Union.
<br>
<p>The genesis of the policy came to a head following the Soviet occupation
<br>
of Afghanistan, when President Jimmy Carter set up a team headed by
<br>
National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski to employ its ‘death by a
<br>
thousands cuts’ policy on the tottering Soviet empire, especially the oil-
<br>
and mineral-rich Central Asian Republics then ruled by Moscow.
<br>
<p>A marriage of convenience
<br>
<p>Thus began the US-love affair with Islamists in which short-term profit
<br>
motivated all parties concerned, but the deadly ramifications of which are
<br>
haunting the world today and the effects of which were brought home
<br>
starkly to America earlier this week.
<br>
<p>This ‘marriage of convenience’, consummated in an alliance with Islamic
<br>
fundamentalists, particularly suited the Pakistani military junta of
<br>
General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq, which was looking for greater strategic depth
<br>
and economic influence in Afghanistan and Central Asia.
<br>
<p>The flip side of the wily general’s agenda was that this alliance with the
<br>
US would also strengthen Pakistan's military capabilities with respect to
<br>
rival India with the induction of sophisticated US weaponry at throwaway
<br>
prices. This was also the time when Pakistan made great strides in
<br>
developing its covert nuclear capability through a combination of
<br>
clandestine transactions, outright theft and forging closer military and
<br>
nuclear relations with China, all connived at by Washington.
<br>
<p>The US-led ‘proxy war’ model was based on the premise that Islamists made
<br>
good anti-Communist allies. The plan was diabolically simple: to hire,
<br>
train and control motivated Islamic mercenaries. The trainers were mainly
<br>
from Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, who learnt their
<br>
craft from American Green Beret commandos and Navy SEALS in various US
<br>
training establishments. Mass training of Afghan mujahideen was
<br>
subsequently conducted by the Pakistan Army under the supervision of the
<br>
elite Special Services Group (SSG), specialists in covert action behind
<br>
enemy lines and the ISI.
<br>
<p>Pakistan’s current military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, spent seven
<br>
years with the SSG and was also involved in training Afghan mujahideen.
<br>
Provided he co-operates, he will prove a useful guide to the US in hunting
<br>
down terrorists inside Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>The entire anti-Soviet operation, headed by the Central Intelligence
<br>
Agency (CIA) and held together on the ground by the ISI, was supported by
<br>
generous donations from the US State Department, Western governments,
<br>
Saudi Arabia and a handful of commando experts from the UK Special Air
<br>
Service (SAS), while surveillance training, communication and first aid
<br>
help came from France.
<br>
<p>Israel provided weapons like rifles, tanks and even artillery pieces,
<br>
captured during its many wars with the Arab states, while Sudan and
<br>
Algeria contributed committed mujahideen and religious motivation. The
<br>
entire operation was, inexplicably but amusingly, christened the Safari
<br>
Club.
<br>
<p>Fallout from the fighting
<br>
<p>The fallout of this ‘holy war’, which ended with the Soviet withdrawal in
<br>
1989, brought in its wake a series of distinctly ‘unholy wars’ and
<br>
‘epidemics of violence’ in places like Kashmir in northern India. It also
<br>
brought grave unrest to the Central Asian and other former Soviet
<br>
Republics like Chechnya as well as to North Africa. Now, it has been
<br>
brought to the US, and to the rest of the world.
<br>
<p>Over the past decade Afghanistan has been steadily devastated by
<br>
internecine battles in which the Pakistan-backed Taliban militia has
<br>
emerged partially victorious. Nearly two million Afghans of the country's
<br>
population of some four million became refugees in Pakistan, Iran and
<br>
Central Asia. The majority of those who were part of the jihad became
<br>
unemployed, lacking food and shelter and, most importantly, patrons.
<br>
<p>This, in turn, made them ideal recruits for exploitation by the ISI and
<br>
Pakistan’s increasingly fundamentalist army. According to intelligence
<br>
estimates over 10,000 Islamic mercenaries, trained in guerrilla warfare
<br>
and armed with sophisticated weapons, are unemployed in Pakistan today,
<br>
waiting to be transported to the next jihad.
<br>
<p>Osama bin Laden was one of many US beneficiaries in its war against
<br>
Moscow. He spent years in the mid-1980s travelling widely to raise funds
<br>
and recruit thousands of Muslim youths to fight the Soviets.
<br>
<p>The rise of Al-Qaeda
<br>
<p>In 1988, with US knowledge, Bin Laden created Al Qaeda (The Base): a
<br>
conglomerate of quasi-independent Islamic terrorist cells in countries
<br>
spread across at least 26 countries, including Algeria, Morocco, Turkey,
<br>
Egypt, Syria, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Burma, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia,
<br>
Kuwait, Indonesia, Kenya, Tanzania, Azerbaijan, Dagestan, Uganda,
<br>
Ethiopia, Syria, Tunisia, Bahrain, Yemen, Bosnia as well as the West Bank
<br>
and Gaza. Western intelligence sources claim Al Quaeda even has a cell in
<br>
Xinjiang in China, a country that ironically was another willing partner
<br>
in the jihad against the Soviets. China wanted the Soviet Union out of
<br>
Afghanistan for its own strategic ends and even trained and despatched
<br>
Muslim Uighurs of the western Xinjiang region to fight alongside the
<br>
Afghan mujahideen. China feared that the old Silk Route along the
<br>
Karakoram Highway could, in time, come under Moscow's domination if the
<br>
Soviets were not swiftly dislodged from Kabul.
<br>
<p>Chinese strategy on this front, however, had a negative fallout for
<br>
Beijing as the returning Uighur jihadis fuelled the already-simmering
<br>
insurgency for an independent Muslim Eastern Turkestan in Xinjiang. This
<br>
insurgency continues, though the Chinese have managed to significantly
<br>
counter it through economic sops, effective sealing of borders and
<br>
drowning dissidence using strong-arm methods, actions unquestioned by the
<br>
outside world.
<br>
<p>Washington turned a blind eye to Al-Qaeda, confident that it would not
<br>
directly impinge on the US. By the time the US embassies in Kenya and
<br>
Tanzania were bombed in 1998, killing 224 people including 12 Americans,
<br>
and the ill-fated World Trade Center was similarly attacked around the
<br>
same time, it was too late for remedial measures. It was this reality that
<br>
was brought home with such an unimaginable atrocity this week.
