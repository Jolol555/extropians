<em>&gt; An unqualified guaranteed minimum  income  may be better than our (U.S.)

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Of all rationales for equalization, the only one I find at all, even
<br>
minimally, justifiable, is in funding education. IMHO, every citizen
<br>
must have a significant level of education, especially in civic virtue,
<br>
in order to be an effective citizen that fulfills his or her
<br>
responsibilities that come with the rights of citizenship. However, I do
<br>
not think that this is something that HAS to be state financed or
<br>
managed.
<br>
<p>For example, schools at all levels could entirely finance themselves and
<br>
provide equal educations to all if they instituted a system whereby
<br>
contracted students received educations in exchange for a guaranteed
<br>
percent of the individual graduates future income that goes to the
<br>
school directly, instead of through multiple layers of government
<br>
bureaucracy.
<br>
<p>All the state would be needed for (and not necessarily in a libertarian
<br>
context) would be to help enforce the honoring of these contracts.
<br>
Schools could easily contract with insurance companies to guarantee its
<br>
graduates make their remittances, thus eliminating the need for
<br>
government in the equation entirely.
