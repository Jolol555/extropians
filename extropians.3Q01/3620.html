<p>
I'm going to offer my impressions and probably get raked over the
<br>
coals.  I found Michael's original post useful because it pointed
<br>
me to some interesting historical information (those not understanding
<br>
the mistakes of history are doomed to repeat them).  Harvey's comments
<br>
were also useful because he did more investigation than I did
<br>
showing that the comments should be viewed in light of the agenda
<br>
of the people making the comments.
<br>
<p>Regarding the question of whether such topics should be posted to
<br>
the extropian list I would have to say yes on two counts.  First,
<br>
I think looking at political history is very useful because we
<br>
are going to have to deal with issues of how to best regulate
<br>
potentially dangerous technology, how to provide rights to
<br>
different classes of &quot;citizens&quot; and how to allocate scarce
<br>
resources (eventually) in the most extropic way.  Second, though
<br>
I'm unsure of what &quot;focused extropic topics&quot; would be, I'm
<br>
sure they have been beaten to death in discussions in the
<br>
archives.  It is perhaps useful to realize that the core
<br>
extropic viewpoint discussion may have been exhausted and
<br>
we are either waiting for &quot;it&quot; to happen or waiting for
<br>
someone brilliant to come along and contribute something
<br>
significant we haven't seen before.  As a result the discussions
<br>
are on the fringe of the core extropic viewpoint and sometimes
<br>
trip over the &quot;that isn't an extropian topic&quot; trip-wire and/or
<br>
degrade into ve-said-ve-said dribble.
<br>
<p>So Mike, I think it was useful and even Harvey would have to
<br>
admit so since it seems he is now planning a Hensonistic
<br>
picketing campaign for the Claremont Institute....
<br>
<p>Harvey said:
<br>
<em>&gt; With this additional information, that they view &quot;natural law&quot; to mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;God's law as presented in the Christian Bible&quot;, do you still think this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is on-topic for the Extropians list? 
</em><br>
<p>There seems to be a lack of balance regarding religion on the list.
<br>
On the one hand Harvey is going after it with stakes and hammers
<br>
while Spike is supporting every new variant falling out of the sky.
<br>
<p>Perhaps one should doubt them all and doubt them all equally
<br>
(because as Harvey says they can't be subjected to scientific
<br>
analysis).  But that does not mean that they will not from time
<br>
to time get something right and perhaps provide useful information,
<br>
insights or shortcuts towards functional societies.
<br>
<p>&quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; (because the all powerful god say so)
<br>
is certainly a much simpler rule to live by than a complicated
<br>
explanation on how killing destroys potentially valuable
<br>
information, might shorten ones own lifespan, doesn't produce
<br>
the most effective use of resources based on game theory, etc.
<br>
<p>While I have no objection to people attacking the core problems
<br>
with religion (one &quot;right&quot; religion, brainwashing before the
<br>
ability to make informed choices, etc.), that has to be balanced
<br>
against the fact that the *average* IQ out there in the world
<br>
is 100.  When people with that intelligence have the time and
<br>
interest to investigate and debate the issues to the depth that
<br>
some list members do, then we can throw out &quot;religion&quot; and replace
<br>
it with a more carefully designed philosophy.  Until then the
<br>
system has worked sufficiently well that at least we have gotten
<br>
ourselves to this point.  Its not a perfect world but it could
<br>
certainly be a lot worse.
<br>
<p>My final point in this sermon would simply be to &quot;lighten up&quot;.
<br>
<p>Robert
