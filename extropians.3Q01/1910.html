<em>&gt;&gt; I think the explanation is to be found in the political strength the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  army accumulated during the 50 years that they kept taking over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  government once and again, every time they didn't like the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  the democratic governments were acting. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't like that explanation; the army ruled a long time in Spain but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quickly became quite well-behaved there.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not well acquainted with the Spanish transition to democracy, but
<br>
I can imagine the fact that a personalistic stable regime ruled
<br>
that long time without interruptions has to make quite the difference.
<br>
Argentina's military kept going in and out of government very often,
<br>
mainly according to the panic attacks of the oligarchy backing them
<br>
up regarding the possibility that Peronists would get away with the
<br>
government or influence the democratic policies too much. The military
<br>
lacked a figure of the likes of Franco, and in fact was prone to a lot
<br>
of internal political struggle (and even occasional armed uprisings
<br>
from one sector against another). I probably chose the wrong words,
<br>
instead of political strength (which of course it had), I should have
<br>
said the military was still a strong party during the first years
<br>
of democracy post-Process due to their political contacts, knowledge
<br>
and manipulation abilities. Dealing with very strong populist political
<br>
parties during many years demanded of them a lot of cunning, besides
<br>
the obvious use of force. Their contacts, cunning and manipulation
<br>
abilities were essential to secure them the amnesty for their killings
<br>
during the new democracy years. Their political power was quickly
<br>
emptied after that, as the budget cuts, the lack of pending issues,
<br>
and the shift of the backing oligarchy towards financial pressure
<br>
methods instead of appealing to the army left them without much to
<br>
do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; In spite of the discredit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  they managed to leave government in 83 with a big part of that strenght
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  intact (the backing up of the local landlords and their oligopolies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  never weakened, as for them all the killings were all right). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Again, I'm not sure what's different between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Argentina and a variety of other Latin countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Would you say the difference is that in, say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Spain or Portugal the landlords and oligopolists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no longer supported the old fascists?  If so, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what's different about Argentina?  The guerilla
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suppression?
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure a good deal of the landlord/oligarchy class were and are still
<br>
deeply indebted to the military for cleaning up not only the guerillas
<br>
but also a lot of political undesirables, and hence they eagerly supported
<br>
them during the early years of democracy. However, they were way more
<br>
thankful for the huge economical benefits reaped during Process governments.
<br>
It is still to be figured out how much of Argetina's huge new foreign debt
<br>
during the dictatorship is simply due to straightforward transfer of
<br>
oligarchy's private debts, and loans from the state banking system to
<br>
them and their companies.
