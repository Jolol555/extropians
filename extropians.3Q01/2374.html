<em>&gt; Olga Bourlin shared with us:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having worked my way through college ...blah, blah ...I know something
</em><br>
about working and being  responsible.
<br>
<p>John Grigg wrote:&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Olga, since you made this statement onlist I will ask you publicly... WHY
</em><br>
do
<br>
<em>&gt; you not believe in child support on principle???
</em><br>
<p>Mainly because my mother worked and reared me (we were immigrants, and dada
<br>
was in another country, anyway, and did not share in my upbringing); my
<br>
maternal grandmother worked to help rear me (Russian women kick ass!); and
<br>
my grandfather, too (not everyone worked at once, but took turns as
<br>
opportunities arose in the various countries we lived before coming to the
<br>
good ole' USA).  I observed that a woman could rear a child, so it was never
<br>
was my goal to depend on a man, necessarily.  There was help in the very
<br>
early formative years, and later my children's biological father and I
<br>
worked out a couple of different living arrangements with our two children
<br>
over the years.
<br>
<p>While I don't believe in child support on principle, I see nothing wrong
<br>
with parents who do not live with their children helping support those
<br>
children (I'm not opposed to that).  I just think there's less acrimony if a
<br>
man - or woman - is forced to pay child support.  If a parent wants to have
<br>
a relationship with their child, they usually come up with something.  If
<br>
not, so be it.  Having children is so self-indulgent anyway - I could
<br>
practially live off of that emotional indulgence when I was rearing
<br>
children.  And I did all right, eventually married again, thereby doubling
<br>
the kids' parent-units.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a man I do believe some men really get taken to the cleaners in divorce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; court.  And for a woman to get alimony for more then a few years(to
</em><br>
upgrade
<br>
<em>&gt; her work skills) is generally rediculous.  But, child support is about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children and deadbeat dads make me want to grind my teeth in anger.  Olga,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you and your children deserved better.
</em><br>
<p>Yes - I really could have used better child care facilities (back in the
<br>
1970s, when my children were small, they was almost non-existent).  Luckily,
<br>
my daughter in law, a civil engineer for WSDT, has child care on the
<br>
premises for her baby today - so, things are looking up).  I believe child
<br>
care should be an earlier extension of the public school process.  (Oh, oh,
<br>
I know some libertarians are going to give me a drubbing for saying this.)
<br>
<p>But, really, don't you think everyone deserves better?  Why not go whole
<br>
hog?  Isn't that what extropians want - improved beings through better
<br>
technology?  &quot;Better&quot; is almost a crap shoot today, and it will be until all
<br>
these new-fangled technologies become available to help in our posthuman
<br>
future, eh?  A couple of winning combinations in the
<br>
crap-shoot-which-is-life is to come up with &quot;health&quot; and a &quot;few smarts&quot; -
<br>
so, I and my children have been very lucky, indeed.  They love their father,
<br>
he loves them, they're great young adults, and all's well with the world.
<br>
The trip had a few bumps along the way, but it was always a privilege and a
<br>
pleasure for me.
<br>
<p>Olga
