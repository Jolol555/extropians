<p><em>&gt;Hey, school in the U.S. *IS* a vacation!  I went to first and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;second grades in Rio de Janeiro -and when I moved to the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt;States I couldn't BELIEVE all the &quot;laffs&quot; American kids were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having in school.  Our Friend the Atom. Arithmetic Is Fun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Halloween parades.  Art classes.  School plays. Bake sales and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;school fairs.  Watching movies.  Making Christmas ornaments (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;swear, in the 4th grade I made ornaments for a whole week in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;school, almost nonstop).  All we ever did in Rio was read novels,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;study history and geography, learn French, master long division by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2nd grade, and take home loads of homework.  But what shocked me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most of all was that EVERYONE in America got promoted to the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grade (in Rio, many students were held back if they didn't master
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what was taught that year).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Of course, this was way back in the days before computers.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from what I've read and observed about American adults in general
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- how deep their ignorance is when confronted with questions about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;geography and basic science - I wouldn't be surprised if American
</em><br>
<em>&gt;schools are still lagging behind many schools in countries we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consider &quot;poor,&quot; &quot;third world&quot; or &quot;backward.&quot;  Of course, we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compulsory education - which may partly account for the skew.
</em><br>
<p><p>As a long time fan of both R. Buckminster Fuller and Mortimer Adler
<br>
and someelse whose home is completely overrunby books, we are in
<br>
complete agreement as to the fact that American education needs a
<br>
complete overhaul.
