<em>&gt; &quot;I'm no fan of public education.  Particularly the LAUSD and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd rather eat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worms than send my kids to public school in L.A.  But there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a *large* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; segment of society that cannot afford to pay for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education of their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kids.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michael
</em><br>
<p>Private education isn't affordable for everyone at this time because:
<br>
<p>1. You already are paying for it through taxes, therefore you don't have it
<br>
to put to private schools.
<br>
2. If private schools were the norm, there would be many grades of schools,
<br>
from the ivy league expensive schools to the moderate but adequate
<br>
&quot;wal-mart&quot; versions that would carry most the students. Considering
<br>
economies of scales, I would estimate that if public schools went away, and
<br>
after the market stabilized in a few years, your taxes may drop 10-15
<br>
percent (in theory) and the cost of the average private school to be about
<br>
2k-5k per year. IMOHO. Pretty reasonable when you factor that price being
<br>
able to be paid over the entire year and with your increase of income from
<br>
lower taxes.
<br>
<p>This sound too far off base to any of you supply siders?
