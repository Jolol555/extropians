<em>&gt; &gt; Maybe PC is simply a knee-jerk response used to dismiss people with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; differing political views.  But what does it really mean?  Without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specifics, I don't think it's very useful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I think the term &quot;PC&quot; has a fairly specific meaning, but isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used rigorously by a lot of people who employ the term.  It's also had very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real impact on Western culture and I'm among those who feel that impact has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been almost entirely negative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I use the term, &quot;PC&quot; applies to a set of ideas, values and goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characterized by:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&gt; post-modernist subjectivism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&gt; extreme cultural relativism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&gt; crypto-marxist condemnation of capitalism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&gt; antipathy to:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &lt;&gt; &quot;patriarchy&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &lt;&gt; Anglic culture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &lt;&gt; exercise of American political and military power in the world outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Am I missing anything?)
</em><br>
<p>yeah, under antipathy to:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt; technology based progress and science in general
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt; the individual right of self defense (of course ;))
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt; the freedom of expression of anything that conflicts with PC values.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, the problem in the contemporary cultural scene is that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constellation of cultural values and vectors is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&gt; almost wholly identified with &quot;the left&quot; (i.e. U.S. left-Democrats and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Social Democrats everywhere else)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&gt; at least in the U.S., became the dominant cultural foundation in academia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and, to a great extent in influential parts of the media
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&gt; had a head-start as a fairly self-conscious ideology vis-a-vis the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reactive &quot;cultural conservative&quot; constellation that developed in response to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All of these factors came together -- again in the U.S., certainly -- to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create a mentality of &quot;siege&quot; in the last two decades among many people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceive &quot;PC&quot; to be a bad thing.  People who came of age in American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; academia in the 1970s and 1980s, especially -- and did not buy into the PC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural paradigm -- correctly perceived that a major element of U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture had been essentially &quot;hijacked&quot; by a group of people whose values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and goals were very different from those who had created the institutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that were being overtaken by policies and ideas shaped by &quot;the PC paradigm&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>But the basis of the PC movement has its roots in the 1930's to the
<br>
1950's in such people as Keynes and Kuhn (part of the academic
<br>
foundation), and found root in the aftermath of the Great Depression
<br>
where an overwhelming percent of the population blindly accepted the
<br>
notion that the free market was a failure and government could fix all
<br>
ills.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cultural phenomena often tend to operate &quot;out of synch&quot; with each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This seems to be the case with attitudes toward the PC paradigm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Significant centers of cultural power have now coalesced around values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinct from the PC paradigm, but many participants in those other cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; streams still feel isolated and overwhelmed by the PC paradigm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, almost all of those new cultural streams are reactive: &quot;The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moral Majority,&quot; the nasty white power groups and the like.
</em><br>
<p>GOing by the Nolan chart, the political paradigm of the 20th century
<br>
dominates along the conservative/liberal axis rather than the
<br>
libertarian/authoritarian axis, which is a 90 degree rotation from the
<br>
enlightenment period which saw a greater orientation between the
<br>
libertarianism of fledgling democracies and the authoritarianism of
<br>
feudal systems.
<br>
<p>I think that it is at present beginning to rotate another 90 degrees in
<br>
both directions (or else a dovetailing of both poles), with the more
<br>
factional 'liberal' economic authoritarian left shifting further toward
<br>
authoritarianism with the more inclusive types shifting toward
<br>
libertarianism, and the conservative movement diverging as well between
<br>
the right libertarians and the social authoritarians.
<br>
<p>This is why I've forseen the 21st century political milieu to
<br>
predominantly be an Techno-liberal versus Primitivist conflict, with
<br>
luddite reactionary revolutions peaking between 2010 and 2020, an end to
<br>
the mercantilist paradigm by 2030, and a world polarized through much of
<br>
the 21st century between neoliberal/libertarian societies that are
<br>
technologically progressive, versus fundamentalist societies that have
<br>
made a religion of environmentalism, seeking to reestablish agrarian
<br>
tyrannies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One phenomenon that I believe can be attributed in part to a reaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against the inroads made by the PC paradigm into U.S. cultural institutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the renaissance of classical liberalism -- with its modern American label
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;libertarianism&quot; -- in groups like the Cato Institute, publications like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reason magazine, and renewed interest in both the origins of and the modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expression of libertarian theory.  This trend is largely an attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salvage the liberal foundation of Western culture in a way that is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reactionary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Relative newcomers to the list should be aware that extropianism is, in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very general sense, part of this latter cultural phenomena.  Although the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general cultural impetus that gave rise to the renaissance in liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought (in the original sense of the word) at the end of the 20th and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beginning of the 21st centuries may have been reactive (to the seizure by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the proponents of post-modernism and the PC paradigm of the &quot;commanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heights&quot; of cultural institutions), extropianism is NOT a &quot;reactionary&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy.  Unfortunately, too many people who are steeped in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vocabulary of the contemporary polarization of political and cultural life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; get confused about this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The other day I joined in condemnation of material that had come from an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essentially reactionary web site, pointing out that we have to see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context in which something is offered to really understand the CULTURAL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SIGNIFICANCE of that material.  ASSESSING THE CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE OF
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT FROM DETERMINING ITS TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD.  This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentally important distinction that is being missed in almost all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussions about public policy and ethics here lately, from posts about IQ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tests, to discussion of financing and control of education, to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reparations discussion, to the talk about what people mean when they use the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word &quot;Mexican&quot;.  Interestingly, I think we're seeing a real example of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different styles of thought and discourse among &quot;the two cultures&quot;: In the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sciences, there's really no merit to talking about the cultural significance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a proposition; it's either true or false, testable or not, fruitful or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not.  In the humanities and politics, truth, testability and fruitfulness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are important, but they aren't the whole story.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, however I think that everyone is 'scientist' enough to understand
<br>
that when you impunge the cultural significance of something, you place
<br>
a value of 'good' or 'bad' on the factuality of that something. People
<br>
who function from 'feeling' (typical of humanities and political types)
<br>
are more likely to deny the factuality of something said by a person or
<br>
group they dislike intensely than something said by the average person,
<br>
even if both are saying the same thing. When a person who they do not
<br>
dislike intensely says something that is also said by those they
<br>
dislike, the reaction is to automatically label that person as a member
<br>
of the disliked group. Its a labeling, a categorization, and a
<br>
discrimination that is not based on the rational evaluation of that
<br>
which is being said.
<br>
<p>Those who categorize and demonize say,&quot;Well, I must judge people by
<br>
their associates because I cannot waste my time examining and contesting
<br>
everything they say, I do not have enough hours in the day to deal with
<br>
all the people I dislike and disagree with.&quot; This is a cop out. The
<br>
proper, rational, and truly LIBERAL way to deal with such a situation is
<br>
to refuse to label, categorize, or contest anything or anyone unless you
<br>
do examine the facts of the issues thoroughly. You know, the old &quot;If you
<br>
have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is to be expected that both sides practice this to some extent, some
<br>
more than others. The fact is that this is a war of ideas, and there can
<br>
be only one winner. Not everyone can go home at the end of the day with
<br>
a prize. The fact that so few can accept this is an indication of how
<br>
deeply subjectivist memes have penetrated society.
