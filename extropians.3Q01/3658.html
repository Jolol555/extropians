<p>I've known people with a whole string of nines in their
<br>
percentile IQ rating.  Some were very effective and involved and
<br>
full of vision and some were as ineffectual, confused and lost
<br>
as any of those with a less lofty score.  IQ simply doesn't
<br>
directly correlate with being effective or fully engaged in
<br>
life.  
<br>
<p>Does this have implications for creating a SI?
