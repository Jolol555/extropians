<p><em>&gt;&gt; But on other [crackpot] issues, I wouldn't be swayed (and on many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; issues, neither would you).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There may well be issues on which I ignore some people's opinions, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think I should believe I am motivated by a desire to find the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth on those issues.
</em><br>
<p>I see.  We are disagreeing about the conditions under which the predicate
<br>
&quot;desires to find the truth about&quot; should be applied to us.  I can see
<br>
furthermore that we are not likely to agree.  Look, if a creationist
<br>
comes up to me with a great sheaf of papers proving that evolution is
<br>
a lie, and if I tell him to go stuff them in the bodily orafice (if a
<br>
trash can isn't conveniently available) and he says to me in return
<br>
&quot;YOU are not a truth seeker about evolution!&quot;, then I say he's wrong.
<br>
<p>Are you claiming that indeed, under these conditions where (like Harvey
<br>
Newstrom and Anders Sandberg) I don't want to waste the time with this
<br>
clown, that on this issue I am not truth-seeking?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; For me, it wouldn't matter whether ten people believe in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; UFOs or ten million do:  my total &quot;web of belief&quot; about the supposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reality of UFOs together with my beliefs about how gullible people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; concerning these issues that the skeptics routinely discuss, preclude
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; me from being influenced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your reasoning here appears to be of the type that produces only probabalistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimates, and the hypothesis that some UFO reports represent real alien
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contact does not appear to be an issue on which certainty is currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible, so I am fairly confident that your certainty is strong evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you are not a truth-seeker on this issue.
</em><br>
<p>Are we also disagreeing on what &quot;certainty&quot; means?  Forgive me if this is
<br>
redundant, but many people hate using the word &quot;certain&quot; without qualifiers.
<br>
If you say that something is &quot;certain&quot; when talking to them, you'll receive
<br>
a mini-lecture about epistemology.  So then you always say &quot;almost certain&quot;
<br>
when talking to these people, and they become very happy.  They become 
<br>
somewhat less happy when I point out that we should probably do a global
<br>
replacement on the term &quot;almost certain&quot; and substitute &quot;certain&quot; for it,
<br>
since---as we both agree---to be absolutely certain is inadmissable.
<br>
Ah! Here's what we can do:  you say that I shouldn't be *certain* that
<br>
reports of UFO alien contact are erroneous.  May I ask you of what you
<br>
are certain, (in the realm of false beliefs, say).
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
