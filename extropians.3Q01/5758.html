<br>
Federal funding limits for stem cell research has focused attention to
<br>
the private sector. Several companies have been scrambling to acquire
<br>
and cultivate lines of stem cells from a variety of sources. Here are
<br>
companies that have taken a lead on stem cell research:
<br>
<p>Aastrom (Nasdaq: ASTM)
<br>
Ann Arbor, MI
<br>
734-930-5777
<br>
<a href="http://www.aastrom.com/">http://www.aastrom.com/</a>
<br>
Aastrom's main research efforts have used adult bone marrow and
<br>
umbilical cord blood. The company has cord blood and bone marrow-derived
<br>
stem cell therapies in phase III clinical trials, two stem cell
<br>
therapies in phase II trials for severe osteoporosis and leukemias, and
<br>
two potential anti-cancer therapies in pre-clinical testing.
<br>
<p>Advanced Cell Technology
<br>
Worchester, MA
<br>
508-756-1212
<br>
www.advancedcell.com
<br>
Advanced Cell Technology (ACT) developed a way to clone primitive human
<br>
stem cells by transferring a human cell nucleus into a bovine egg cell.
<br>
The company made news in January 2001 by successfully cloning an
<br>
endangered animal, a guar. ACT's initial stem cell research is directed
<br>
at treating rejection of transplanted organs and neurodegenerative
<br>
diseases such as
<br>
Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's.
<br>
<p>Anthrogenesis
<br>
Cedar Knolls, NJ
<br>
973-267-8200
<br>
www.anthrogenesis.com
<br>
Developed way to harvest stem cells from placentas, which are otherwise
<br>
routinely discarded after childbirth. The company claims the ability to
<br>
collect 10 times as many stem cells than other methods.
<br>
<p>Cambrex (NYSE: CBM)
<br>
East Rutherford, NJ
<br>
201-804-3062
<br>
www.cambrex.com
<br>
Offers hematopoietic stem cells through its own FDA-approved paid bone
<br>
marrow donor program, as well from peripheral blood stimulated by growth
<br>
factors, umbilical cord blood and fetal liver tissue.
<br>
<p>Cythera, Inc.
<br>
San Diego, CA
<br>
858-455-3708
<br>
www.cytheraco.com
<br>
A small, privately held company with nine embryonic stem cell
<br>
derivations on the NIH registry. Cythera's stem cells, which were
<br>
created with a novel process different from the method patented by the
<br>
University of Wisconsin, have not yet been fully characterized. When
<br>
ready, Cythera says it intends to make their stem cells available to the
<br>
research community. The
<br>
company's initial focus is the development of functional islet cell
<br>
transplants for the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes.
<br>
<p>Geron (Nasdaq: GERN)
<br>
Menlo Park, CA
<br>
650-473-7700
<br>
www.geron.com
<br>
Geron acted decisively and early to acquire key patents of stem cell
<br>
pioneers James Thompson of University of Wisconsin and John Gearhart of
<br>
Johns Hopkins. In August 2001, Geron was sued by Wisconsin Alumni
<br>
Research Foundation (WARF), which holds the Thompson patents, over
<br>
options to negotiate additional stem rights. Under the initial license
<br>
agreement, Geron has exclusive commercialization rights to stem cells
<br>
that arise to liver, muscle, neural, bone, pancreatic and blood tissue.
<br>
<p>Incara Pharmaceuticals
<br>
Research Triangle Park, NC
<br>
919-558-8688
<br>
www.incara.com
<br>
Developing human liver stem cells for the treatment of liver failure,
<br>
based on a patented method developed by Lola M. Reid of the University
<br>
of North Carolina. The company plans to begin phase I clinical trials in
<br>
late 2001.
<br>
<p>Ixion Biotechnology
<br>
Alachua, FL
<br>
386-418-1428
<br>
www.ixion-biotech.com
<br>
Located near University of Florida, Gainesville, Ixion is developing
<br>
pancreatic islet stem cells for the treatment of diabetes. Has succeeded
<br>
in sustaining islet stem cells in culture, which has been an elusive
<br>
goal. Products not yet in clinical trials.
<br>
<p>Layton Biosciences
<br>
Sunnyvale, CA
<br>
408-616-1000
<br>
www.laytonbio.com
<br>
Produces human neural cells that aren't exactly stem cells, but derived
<br>
from a cancer cell line developed by Peter Andrews in the early 1980s at
<br>
the Wistar Institute (Philadelphia, PA). The company intends to develop
<br>
treatments for diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems.
<br>
Began phase I clinical trials in 1998.

<br>
central nervous system stem cell technology created by Karl Johe while
<br>

A privately held company developing replacement connective tissue such
<br>
as cartilage and tendon from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Osiris

<br>
