Q: what should be done for those who for one reason or another, many through no
<br>
real fault of their own, become economically unviable (the market literally has
<br>
no need for their labor sufficient to pay them a livable wage)?  -Samantha Atkins
<br>
<p>Q: Some persons, through no fault of their own, cannot afford medical treatment
<br>
(what if you have a stroke at age 16?).  Kids or no kids, they can't pay.  Are
<br>
you saying that they are useless, discardable, by definition not worthy of
<br>
being helped?  Would you let them starve amid plenty?  -Rafal Smigrodzki
<br>
<p>(Rafal opposes a GI but candidly (thank you!) wrote &quot;I am willing to help them,
<br>
to some extent, and to support the use of governmental oppression to force other
<br>
citizens to help, too&quot;, at least in regard to life and death situations.)
<br>
<p>My answer has to be broken down into three parts:  (i) what should in general
<br>
be done, and what I would have recommended that countries do which are just
<br>
starting out,  (ii) what Canada, Germany, the U.S., Australia, and the
<br>
rest of the developed world should do in the immediate future, and (iii)
<br>
(hardest of all) how the impending MNT and Singularity affect the second
<br>
question.
<br>
<p>In this posting, I will address (i) only.  My model of a new country is
<br>
the United States, partly because I know more about it than I do about
<br>
the origins of other nations, but partly because by the time that it
<br>
officially begun, there existed extremely good traditions of liberty,
<br>
self-reliance, prosperity, and productivity.  It was no coincidence that
<br>
these things arose together.
<br>
<p>I don't know for sure at what moment in U.S. history any government 
<br>
began extracting money from its citizens solely to benefit other
<br>
citizens, but it may have been 1913 with the enactment of the Federal
<br>
Income Tax.  (Still, I don't know when government charity really began.)
<br>
But it was a terrible mistake, which, despite its good intentions, has
<br>
harmed the lives of millions of people.  For every person genuinely
<br>
benefitted---whose life was saved or whose health was restored---there
<br>
were untold thousands who delayed or postponed permanently the making
<br>
of life-changing difficult decisions.  This is certainly not to suggest
<br>
that Chicago or New York in 1880 was free of crime, drugs, and people
<br>
in seemingly hopeless situations.  (But then, there have never been large
<br>
cities without these problems, whether it's Cairo today or Rome in 100AD.)
<br>
But there was no institutionalized underclass, not even in Appalachia,
<br>
a place where people couldn't leave unfair and frightful situations
<br>
mainly because of their traditions and their fatalism.
<br>
<p>The Los Angeles police force may be a good place start to describe some of
<br>
the alternatives available to cities in the early years of this century.
<br>
In one way, vigilantism is a patent disregard of lawful procedures, but
<br>
in another way it exemplifies community spirit.  Vigilantism arises when
<br>
common citizens---who have to be relatively few in number compared to
<br>
the anonymity that afflicts modern cities---act not out of self-interest
<br>
but out of a sincere desire to make their community a better place, and
<br>
that means, to them, taking the law into their own hands.  We commonly
<br>
approve, instead, of these same citizens (of communities where, as I say,
<br>
people have identities) being deputized under the auspices of a legal
<br>
establishment that promises a quick and speedy justice, but justice
<br>
nonetheless.
<br>
<p>The Los Angeles police force was moved, according to a television
<br>
documentary I saw, by what was evidently this same spirit (which isn't
<br>
too surprising knowing what else they're wont to do).  In the 1930's
<br>
and 40's they faced an imminent invasion by the Mafia, which had
<br>
already firmly established itself in dozens of eastern cities.  The
<br>
L.A. police would get word that some mobster was going to fly in 
<br>
and meet him at the airport.  Sometimes they'd just grab him and
<br>
put him on the next plane back to New York, &quot;thus violating his
<br>
civil rights&quot;, I suppose.  At other times, they'd simply trail a
<br>
known mobster on the road, and literally pull him over every two
<br>
blocks to demand identification and hassle him in other ways.  As a
<br>
result the Mafia didn't get established in L.A. until just recently.
<br>
<p>Do you know how the L.A. police used to handle homelessness?  They'd
<br>
take a bum, or other loiterer or vagrant, give him something to eat,
<br>
and then drive him to the city limits (which is pretty far away in
<br>
L.A.) and just dump him out.  Until recently, L.A. didn't have much 
<br>
of a homeless problem; many of the same people, I imagine, went to
<br>
San Francisco.
<br>
<p>As cruel as it sounds at first, as uncaring as it appears (and is,
<br>
actually), this is the best solution.  Sooner or later, except in
<br>
a few cases, the drifter will drift into some small town, and get
<br>
an extremely low paying job, merely because all his alternatives
<br>
are worse.  (Naturally, today such an option isn't available because
<br>
of the minimum wage laws, and the fact that today's vagrants have
<br>
been tolerated for so long, that the reform of any particular one
<br>
of them is highly unlikely.)
<br>
<p>But all this is what should have been done.  I'm afraid that unless
<br>
truly Orwellian techniques are used, thousands and thousands of people
<br>
today are rather hopelessly wedded to lives of zero economic utility,
<br>
drug dependency, and crime.  (Yes, many thousands aren't, and many may
<br>
turn their lives around.)  I'll say more about what I think our options
<br>
today are in another post, and then start guessing (like everyone else
<br>
is) about the future.
