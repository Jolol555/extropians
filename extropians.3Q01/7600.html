Gah.
<br>
<p>I say yes on one, no on two. Ubiquitous physical surveillance is 
<br>
a fait accompli. So is the wide, legitimate use of encryption. 
<br>
Try telling the banks of the world they can't use crypto and see
<br>
what kind of answer you get. I'm going to install GPG tonight.
<br>
<p>Everyone needs to GROW UP.
