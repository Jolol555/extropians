<em>&gt;From: &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20future%20president?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200108271945.MAA07041@well.com&gt;">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;These kinds of arguments scare me for what they imply more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what they actually say.  Heston seems to want to strike up a chord
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with certain hate groups without actually saying he agrees with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them.  He references specific subjects and code-words, but doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actually repeat the full litany.  As such, he and his supporters
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take the high ground.  He can truthfully claim that he didn't say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anything bad about a specific group.  He just referenced them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without really saying anything specific.
</em><br>
<p>I've re-read this speech several times without finding anything
<br>
like this there. Please list specifics.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;This is the exact kind of speech that is posted all over and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quoted by white-supremacists, homophobes, anti-Semites, etc.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all &quot;know&quot; what he is talking about, but it is hard to prove that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he said anything.  
</em><br>
<p><p>Have you seen this speech being misrepresented on any such site?
<br>
Let me know and I'll pass it on to Mr Heston.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It is the exact vague speech that Clinton uses to describe his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sexual activities, or that drug dealers and prostitutes use to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;negotiate a deal.  They know they can't say what they mean, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they talk around an issue.  If they get caught, they will insist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that they didn't really say anything.
</em><br>
<p>Lets see, your comparing Heston to Clinton, a drug dealer, and a
<br>
prostitute. I think I know political propaganda when I hear it.
<br>
<p>By the way, Mr Heston is a man of character and integrity and a
<br>
better man on his worse day than Bill Clinton will ever be on his
<br>
best.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;When he says his Creator gave him a gift which might be used in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the political process, he implies that God will guide him to run
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for president and guide his decisions while he is president.
</em><br>
<p>He never says any such thing in this speech. Retraction please.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;When he says we are fighting a great civil war and cultural war
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that is trying to hijack our birthright, he is implying that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wants to turn back history to earlier political times and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights based on birth.
</em><br>
<p>He says nor implys any such thing he says &quot;with Orwellian fervor,
<br>
certain acceptable thoughts and speech are mandated.&quot; Thats what he
<br>
said, that's what he meant.
<br>
<p><p>The &quot;birthright&quot; he is refering to is the birth of our nation, and
<br>
the right of free speech.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;When he says that he that our problems are bigger than the gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issue, he implies that the gun issue is at its core.
</em><br>
<p>Nonsense, he's saying there are more important issues than guns and
<br>
that he should be listed to for what he is saying, not because he
<br>
is the elected president of the NRA.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;When he says that white pride is not racist, he implies that he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supporting white pride groups without mentioning any support for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other races.
</em><br>
<p>Mr Heston is not a white supremacist Harvey, he's saying that if
<br>
there is such a thing as black pride then white pride, red pride,
<br>
is equally valid. He is correct.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;When he says that gay rights should extend no further than &quot;my&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights or &quot;your&quot; rights, he implies that gays are fighting for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unfair rights not equal rights.  He also implies that gays are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;part of &quot;us/me/you&quot; but some other group.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, sometimes these groups do try to get special treatment laws
<br>
passed, hate crimes are an example. When someone who is gay refers
<br>
to themselves as gay they have drawn a distinction, it is equally
<br>
ok for anyone else to make that distinction.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;When he spoke against the Axis Powers in World War II, and draws
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a parallel between the holocaust and what is currently happening
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to gun owners, he implies the holocaust was less than it was or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that gun control equals Nazi atrocities.
</em><br>
<p>He implies no such thing, he said &quot;But during a speech, when I drew
<br>
an analogy between singling out innocent Jews and singling out
<br>
innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.&quot; He is arguing
<br>
against singling out those who haven't done anything wrong, he is
<br>
talking about unreasoned prejudice.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;When he gives an example of dental patients who got AIDS from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dentists who didn't disclose it, he implies that AIDS patients
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must be publicly disclosed and kept away from the general public.
</em><br>
<p>He did not say anything about keeping them away, but he does feel
<br>
their patients have a right to know. Shall we take a vote?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When he points out that Dr. King said &quot;negroes&quot; but its not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;allowed now, he implies that we should be allowed classify people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into another race by the color of their skin.
</em><br>
<p>COME ON NOW! How do you derive that from what he said! From now on
<br>
anyone referring to me as &quot;white&quot; is a racist. Now do you see?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When he claims to be a Native American because he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blood-initiated into a tribe, he implies that we should discount
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any racism that native Americans see because he is one and doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;see any discrimination.
</em><br>
<p>He referred to this in a very brief discussion as to the
<br>
awkwardness of hyphenated names. Mr Heston believes citizens of
<br>
this country are &quot;Americans&quot;, period.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When he says one can talk about race without being a racist, he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;implies that he wants to talk about race and make decisions based
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on race.
</em><br>
<p>No, he means what he said, I can refer to someone as black or
<br>
hispanic or white or anything else, imparting information without
<br>
negatively discriminating.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When he says that one can see distinctions between genders without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being sexist, it implies that he wants to observe differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between genders and probably make decisions based on gender.
</em><br>
<p>No, once again he is saying that you can refer to the obvious
<br>
differences in people without meaning anything negative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When he says you can think critically about a denomination without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being anti-religion, it implies that he wants to criticize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;specific religions for their beliefs without criticizing others.
</em><br>
<p>Again he is saying that you can make observations based on
<br>
difference without implying any sort of negativity.
<br>
<p>What he said specifically was &quot;If you talk about race, it does not
<br>
make you a racist. If you see a difference between the genders it
<br>
does not make you a sexist. If you think critically (Extropian)
<br>
about a denomination, it does not make you anti-religion.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;When he says you can accept but not celebrate homosexuality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without being a homophobe, he implies that we can accept that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exists but we don't have to like it or even cooperate with it.
</em><br>
<p>He didn't say the second part but in this case  I think that's a
<br>
pretty good implication based on the facts.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;When he says disobedience is in our DNA and follows the awesome
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power of Gandhi, Thoreau, and Jesus, he implies a racial rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and manifest destiny for certain groups.
</em><br>
<p>For Indians, writers and a christian mystic?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;When he argues for the right to discuss race, guns, religion and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conservatism, but then argues against the right to discuss
</em><br>
<em>&gt;liberalism on  campus, anti-authority in entertainment, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political correctness in entertainment, he implies that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;free-speech is more for some ideas than others.
</em><br>
<p>Where did he argue against discussing liberalism on campus?
<br>
<p>The right to discuss anti-authority in entertainment? He made no
<br>
such statement.
<br>
<p>You mean the part about the ICE-T song about murdering an innocent
<br>
cop? He was taking that position as a stockholder that it was wrong
<br>
for the company to profit from such a thing, and he put his
<br>
reputation on the line to defend what he thought was right. 
<br>
<p>He was encouraging people to have the guts to stand up for what
<br>
they believe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Heston seems to be gathering support for some political agenda to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;address &quot;negroes&quot;, &quot;homosexuals&quot;, &quot;feminists&quot;, &quot;anti-authority
</em><br>
<em>&gt;musicians&quot;, &quot;politically correct entertainers&quot;, &quot;liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;teachers&quot;, &quot;AIDS-infected people&quot;, etc.  He wants to recognize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;differences based on race, gender, orientation, religion and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political beliefs.  The fact that he doesn't specify what he wants
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to do with these groups or how they should be treated differently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does not diminish the fact that he seems to be singling out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;specific groups for different treatment in some unspecified way.
</em><br>
<p>Heston's speech was about free speech, not the political correct
<br>
jargon that passes for free speech these days, period.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Even though I can't prove that his plans for these groups are bad,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the very fact that he is publicly compiling a list of groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ominous.  He is drawing the lines between &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot;.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can only guess what the next step will be.
</em><br>
<p>Actually we know what the next step was since this speech was years
<br>
ago, he ran for, and was elected to an unprecedented third term as
<br>
NRA president.
<br>
<p>That's all there is to it.
