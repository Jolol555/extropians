<p>&lt;&lt; The struggle against terrorism will take years because it will take that
<br>
&nbsp;long to establish large secure bases surrounding the oil-rich areas of
<br>
&nbsp;the middle east. This is american power projection at it's finest, and
<br>
&nbsp;now using the 9/11 events as an excuse, we can pretty much blackmail
<br>
&nbsp;many of the countries in the region into accepting an american military
<br>
&nbsp;presence.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;And with the destablizing effects this will have thruout the region,
<br>
&nbsp;why, it's a good thing we're there in force, ready to protect legitimate
<br>
&nbsp;governments from the anger of their own people, isn't it?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;World domination, american style. What do you think?

<br>
What? and no Disneylands? There is now some information (perhaps propaganda) 
<br>
implying that The CIA, the Saudi Rulership, Pakistani Intelligence have been 
<br>
instrumental in helping Osama set up Al Qeida, and Osama would never be 
<br>
permitted to be brought in alive to testify thus.  The Saudi Royals are 
<br>
surely implicated in his early funding and the next goal of Osama will be to 
<br>
'bring the West to its needs by hitting the Saudi Oil system.
<br>
<p>This explanation could be an excuse cooked-up to justify and Oil take-over. 
<br>
On the other hand, human stupidity is not merely an American talent, and our 
<br>
Saudi and Pakistani friends could have screwed the pooch by playing nice-nice 
<br>
with Osama's activities. This could also hand America the ball, without a 
<br>
grand conspiracy.
<br>
<p>Cheaper then a war, would be the production of Heavy Crude Oil, and Natural 
<br>
Gas conversion into gasoline, coal to gasoline, and yes, renewables if 
<br>
technically achievable soon enough.
