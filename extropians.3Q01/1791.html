<p><em>&gt; But the socially redemptive virtues you invoke only deserve to be installed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and maintained if the world keeps kicking over in the same old way. And we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here on this list have agreed, pretty much (haven't we?), that this sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't too likely. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but (as you said in some text I deleted) it could take a while
<br>
to ramp up to the Singularity.  More important, perhaps, is that I
<br>
just have a problem suggesting to people---say in their early twenties---
<br>
that saving money is probably pointless, working hard (and getting a
<br>
good job), educating yourself (even if you don't feel like it)...
<br>
I just have a hard problem suggesting to them that they needn't do
<br>
these things.  I'm pretty sure you feel the same way.  I think that
<br>
people are simply better off if they follow the &quot;old&quot; maxims.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Aside: In THE SPIKE I advocate measures such as guaranteed income, funded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from taxes, as a stop-gap to alleviate the worst effects of patchy poverty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caused, in many cases, by a specific family history of prejudice, neglect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or cultural deracination, and also to help salvage those flung out of work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due to the acceleration of technological innovations.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not bitterly wedded to any precise view on all this; that is,
<br>
as I've said &quot;when we are rich enough then okay&quot;  (a view which
<br>
could be ridiculed, and perhaps rightly so by many here), then
<br>
at that &quot;faraway&quot; time, sure, let's feed everyone.
<br>
<p>My question for you is this:  don't you think it somewhat inappropriate
<br>
to extort money from one set of persons (those who have innocently
<br>
accumulated wealth by self-denial, hard work, talent, industry, thrift,
<br>
or service to others), and bestow it on some other people?  You're
<br>
familiar with the libertarian view that abhors initial use of force.
<br>
(I'm just not familiar with what your answer would be, sorry.)  Do you
<br>
see this as a case of the end justifying the means?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The idea, after all, isn't to make every poor person a millionaire,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just to make certain that they're modestly housed, clothed and fed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if they spend  their small pittance on booze and drugs and big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; screen TV sets?  I dunno, line 'em up against the wall and shoot 'em?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (For future readers of the archives: that was just a tasteless joke,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a policy recommendation.)
</em><br>
<p>:-)  tasteless, perhaps.  I seriously doubt that you or I, Damien,
<br>
are to liable to feel attacked by innuendo and sarcasm, but many
<br>
people will.  Frankly, I am afraid to indulge in excess sarcasm
<br>
about the beliefs of people on this list with whom I disagree---I've
<br>
already seen some completely inexplicable flying-off-the-handle even
<br>
when I was as discreet as I could possibly be.  I don't want there
<br>
to be a double-standard of who gets to make jokes about nazis, or
<br>
shooting people and who doesn't.  I'm sure that you don't either :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That diversion aside, I repeat: Making provision in the old-fashioned way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and inculcating the personal values appropriate to the frontier or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1930s or 1950s, looks totally pointless in a world we expect to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transformed exponentially during the immediate decades ahead.
</em><br>
<p>People like Bill Gates now have wealth that is on the order
<br>
of 10^7 times as much as some poor person needs to sustain
<br>
life.  Maybe it would be best to wait until that figure gets
<br>
to 10^12 or 10^13, because then a number of compassionate rich
<br>
people will simply fund a minimal standard of living for everyone.
<br>
This should occur as we approach the Singularity, and we don't
<br>
the onerous stealing from the rich to give to the poor (by force).
<br>
