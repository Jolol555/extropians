</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  But...how do you *get* the bridgehead to the Moon in the first
<br>
place?  That's the barrier that cheap launches can help solve.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; cheaply might make this possible.  It'd also open up a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; potentially cheaper material resources (asteroid/lunar mining), with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; similar benefits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The launch problem is really tough. It is really more interesting working
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Possibly...but I note that, despite the number of people who have said
<br>
teleoperation et al would be a good thing, no one's scraped together
<br>
the money to do it, except for a few limited-function scientific
<br>
probes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If things take a turn for the much worse, we could set up a refuge in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; space with very little possibility of those who would hunt us down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being able to touch us once we are there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You, personally? ExI? Excuse me, by definition you're asking for resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which few 0.1% of the world command. What makes you think you're going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wind up one of the 'leet?
</em><br>
<p>Again, once cheap space launches are possible, resources become less of
<br>
a problem.  That said, I, personally, am trying to become one of the
<br>
'leet so I can turn ideas like this into reality...but until and unless
<br>
I suceed, I have the alternative of discussing these ideas so that
<br>
either:
<br>
* An existing 'leet may decide to implement them (from which I, as a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;member of the general public, will still derive some benefit)
<br>
* If and when I come into money, I will have a more workable version of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the ideas to implement (which may reduce the amount of money I'll
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;need)
