<em>&gt; I agree with the not teaching morality in school point you made, its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unworkable with the public school system, but it would work with a private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one though. On the other hand, failure to identity evil only benefits evil.
</em><br>
<p>There is no reason why public schools cannot teach children how to
<br>
develop their own morality and ethics. Children are not objects, not the
<br>
property of their parents. It is an abuse of parental responsibility to
<br>
claim that parents have the absolute right to teach their kids as they
<br>
see fit. Kids are not clones, not robots. Furthermore, how can a parent
<br>
be truly confident that their own morality or ethics are really 'true'
<br>
if their kids are not free to determine and test the truth of them for
<br>
themselves? As I've said many times: &quot;Virtuous behavior is only such
<br>
when it is freely chosen.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are those of us that believe in an &quot;objective&quot; morality based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason. Participants in this philosophy are more then welcome to identify an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evil and explain why it is so. Trying to obscure an immoral act is in effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immoral. The semantic quagmire you speak of is a problem and I'm not sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to get around it as long as people of different base philosophies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking. You cant agree on the definition of racism (sound familiar) if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cant even agree if existence is objective or relative (or on your axioms).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but this is all a matter of disagreement over facts, a sort of
<br>
Bayesian exchange. If two actors cannot agree on the facts of an
<br>
exchange, then no Bayesian interaction will occur.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remember the old saying &quot;Evil triumphs when good men do nothing&quot;. Also, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can get into the semantic quagmire arguing your terms as well, like what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adultery. Remember the recent presidential fiasco where oral sex wasnt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; included in that definition or the LONG thread where we attemped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unsuccessfully to define racism. Eventually, this attempt to dealt with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts by working further away from the abstract and more on the concrete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will fail as we try to determine the definition of what &quot;IS&quot; is. Very sad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed.
</em><br>
<p>Yes it is very sad, but again it can all be reduced to situations of
<br>
individuals arguing from non-Bayesian positions. An argument based on a
<br>
falsehood will always be at odds with those that are not.
<br>
<p>For example (taking the 'oral sex is not sex' debate),
<br>
<p>What is sex?
<br>
a) an act between two people that results in the creation of a viable
<br>
fetus.
<br>
b) an act between two people that results in the erotic stimulation of
<br>
all participants to full ejaculation
<br>
c) an act that results in some degree of erotic arousal by one or more
<br>
willing and consenting participants
<br>
d) any act, object, expression, color, etc that results in a person
<br>
experiencing even minimal involuntary reflexes that involve one or more
<br>
organs involved in sexual acts in any way.
<br>
<p>It seems that Clinton does not think that c) is 'sex', at least for
<br>
anyone who does not initiate any action that causes others to ejaculate.
<br>
Of course, by denying (c), according to the stats, most sexual activity
<br>
by most people in their lives is not actually sex, including
<br>
masturbation.
