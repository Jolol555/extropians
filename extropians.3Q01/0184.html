<p>Hard edges don't give you a useful fitness gradient. I'm curious as to

<p><em>&gt; 3 - The key to evolving anything is the fitness test. If I want to

<p>Random online geek is hardly comparable to a CyClist.

<p><em>&gt; 4 - Any contradictions in GAC are real contradictions in us. It can't

<p>Yes, I contributed about 100 of them. I was trying, but both the absence

of domain allocation and leads and the procrustian nature of the

contributors fared little better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; claim to be collecting human consensus information - CYC and Open Mind

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Dunno, both your methods are obviously flawed, and your attitude does seem
<br>
to have a few problems. Mindpixel is miles away even from Cyc, which at
<br>
least was done by a number of smart, experienced experts, using a
<br>
comparatively rich framework.
