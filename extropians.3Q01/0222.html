</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no need for a &quot;spoiler alert&quot; in this message.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is because after having seen A.I. this afternoon, Jessica and I are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding it quite impossible to find any way to &quot;spoil&quot; this movie that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spielberg did not do himself.  I promise you, I went into that theater not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Stanley Kubrick's #1 fan looking to bash Spielberg, but as a movie fan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking to enjoy a movie.  I am not a professional film critic and I stand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing to gain by bashing a movie.  But I decided that I had to see it in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to give an honest review, and here it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Put it this way - if you've seen Pinocchio, and you've seen E.T., then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagine what the two merged together would look like and you get A.I.  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who wanted science fiction, it wasn't there.  For those, like me,
</em><br>
who
<br>
<em>&gt; wanted an exploration of the moral quandaries surrounding the development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of scientient robots, it was a serious letdown as the issue was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explored in the least.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead, the entire movie was about &quot;a robot boy who wanted to be made
</em><br>
into
<br>
<em>&gt; a real boy so his mommy would love him - and the Blue Fairy from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pinocchio story would make it happen.&quot;  I'm not kidding, I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exaggerating.  Interspersed in the film are plenty of cheap &quot;Kodak
</em><br>
moments&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; such as a silhouette against the moon a la E.T., and other ripoffs of
</em><br>
other
<br>
<em>&gt; movies which are not even remotely subtle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The score was awful - just plain awful.  I whispered to Jessica &quot;I wonder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who this is, it's cheesy like John Williams but it doesn't sound like his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff.&quot;  Sure enough, it was John Williams (though I did not know this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until the closing credits).  It was awful because of the complete lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriousness in a film whose topic deserved at least a sliver of
</em><br>
seriousness.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because the script (authored by Spielberg) was so simplistic, I imagine it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was difficult to get any serious actors to want to be in the film - for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this reason, other than Haley Joel Osment the only actors cast with any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of pre-existing established reputation were William Hurt and Jude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Law.  And Hurt's character was cast to the wind, leaving only Osment and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Law to carry the film.  Osment did as much as he could, but his shoulders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not THAT broad (literally and metaphorically).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The rest of the acting was as poor as the script would allow.  The mother
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Frances O'Connor) and father (Sam Robards), both previously unknown to
</em><br>
me,
<br>
<em>&gt; will soon vanish from my mind, for their performances were simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incompetent.  Martin, played by some other child actor, was OK for a child
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actor, which in this film made him stand out above the rest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporting cast.  The surprise casting move of the movie was for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cartoonish Einstein holograph called &quot;Dr. Know&quot;; the voiceover was done by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robin Williams in much the same flavor as Gilbert Gottfried's annoying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voiceover in Disney's adaptation of Alladin.  And finally, the only other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; character who appeared in more than one scene was the robotic teddybear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Teddy - who was essentially the Jar Jar Binks of this movie.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The special effects were excellent - but as Mr. Ust says about The Phantom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Menace, &quot;See why money and lots of effects can't make a bad story
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good.&quot;  All of the technical facets of the film were top-notch
</em><br>
first-rate -
<br>
<em>&gt; but the technicians are limited by the artistic vision of their director,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and in this movie special effects functioned as little more than eye
</em><br>
candy.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The reason why I love Kubrick films is because of the way he could make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picture say a thousand words, and because of the way at 24 frames a second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he could give an audience a most intense catharsis (I won't say &quot;the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intense&quot; because of my lack of knowledge of foreign film, but certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more intense than any other American director).  He didn't just tell a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story in his films; he taught us something important about ourselves or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the world in which we live.  There was one reason why Kubrick had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never &quot;co-directed&quot; or given any kind of creative control of his projects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to anyone else; in the end, the finished product that was shipped out was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HIS vision - and though all of his movies are distinct, they are all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinctly HIS.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A.I. had Kubrick's name listed as a producer, and in my opinion this is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grave blasphemy.  When Spielberg deigned to pick up where Kubrick left
</em><br>
off,
<br>
<em>&gt; he had a moral responsibility to the memory of Kubrick and to the body of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work that Kubrick left behind (including 2001: A Space Odyssey, which also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explores the moral issues surrounding artificial intelligence) to make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most brilliant film of which he was capable.  At the very least, with
</em><br>
Blade
<br>
<em>&gt; Runner nearing its 20th anniversary I think that the least Spielberg could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have done was to try and outdo the depth that Ridley Scott provided to his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human characters as well as his replicants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, I don't think there can be any doubt that Spielberg
</em><br>
didn't
<br>
<em>&gt; put the slightest effort into making a decent movie.  I haven't seen
</em><br>
Saving
<br>
<em>&gt; Private Ryan, but I have seen Schindler's List and Amistad and I know the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; man is capable of better than this.  He was clearly coasting through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project and looking to make a quick buck off of Kubrick's reputation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short, on a 10 scale, Jessica rates the film a 2 and I rate it a 3.
</em><br>
Our
<br>
<em>&gt; rationale for not giving it a 1 is the same: when the special effects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people put this job on their resumes we don't want anyone to think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they did a poor job.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We advise everyone to skip this at the theater, and if you have to see
</em><br>
it -
<br>
<em>&gt; borrow an illegal copy.  Spielberg must not make another dime off this
</em><br>
film.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most sincerely,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dave
