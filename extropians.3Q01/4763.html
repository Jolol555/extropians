John Grigg rhetorically asks
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, what accounts for the economic dominance of the United States?
</em><br>
<p>Here are the four reasons that I know of, in order:
<br>
<p>1. inheritance of Protestant culture/ethics from colonial days
<br>
2. comparitively large degree of freedom, especially during
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the crucial 19th century
<br>
3. enormous natural resources and a temperate climate
<br>
4. a very poor educational system.
<br>
<p>Of these advantages, Brazil, which you mentioned, apparently has
<br>
only number 4, although I'm sure that number 2 is rapidly 
<br>
improving.
<br>
<p>Libertarians usually forget about number 1, and the impact of
<br>
culture in general.
<br>
<p>Almost everyone (except libertarians) underrate the importance
<br>
of number 2.
<br>
<p>Everyone acknowledges number 3, except a few ideologues.
<br>
<p>And no one appreciates or understands number 4, so I must explain:
<br>
Countries so unfortunate as to have a well working educational
<br>
system develop highly literate populaces eager to embrace
<br>
idealistic theories.  (&quot;A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.&quot;)  
<br>
Since it is so *very* difficult to appreciate free-market 
<br>
economics, let alone understand it, the people remain highly
<br>
ignorant of the mechanisms behind wealth production despite
<br>
becoming highly educated, just like Frank Baum's acclaimed
<br>
Woggle Bug T.E. (thoroughly educated).
<br>
<p>But unlike most Americans, who traditionally had their eyes only
<br>
on the next dollar and were completely uninterested in &quot;theory&quot;,
<br>
the Japanese were very willing to do or die for the Emperor, the
<br>
Germans to embrace any wild and wacky theory that came along, and
<br>
the Scandinavians and British eager to try socializing everything
<br>
that they could think of.
<br>
<p>Those are the four reasons that America, even controlling for its
<br>
large population into account, began to be the world's greatest
<br>
economy since the turn of the 20th century.
