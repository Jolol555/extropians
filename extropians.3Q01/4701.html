<em>&gt; &gt;  Isn't it odd that OUR ideas are classified as 'eugenics' by the state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the luddites, when it is their policies that are eugenics in fact?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm sorry, I must have expressed myself badly.  It isn't the classification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our ideas that I was saying was a problem, it was the label.  You can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk about the ideas (almost) as much as you want, without running into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem I was talking about.  If you use the term &quot;eugenics&quot; to label
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything you espouse, you will immediately lose a significant part of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; audience.  If you feel the term is more important than the audience, then I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't try to keep you from using it.  I only make the recommendation so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people I respect will consider whether they are preemptively offending some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; audiences before they can start talking about their ideas.
</em><br>
<p>I don't disagree with you here. What I was noting is how the term has
<br>
come to have its meaning turn around from its (the science part) use as
<br>
a fascist enforced policy to one that fascists oppose when individuals
<br>
try to claim their own right to control their destiny.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was trying to think of an analogous term earlier, and I finally came up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a symbol that will do.  The swastika has a long and respectable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history before the Nazis used it.  Unfortunately, it will be a good long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time before it is possible to use a swastika as a symbol for anything you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want people to respect without drawing unwelcome assocations.  All I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying is it would be an improvement in communication to use a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symbol.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you (Mike) are trying to tell me that it's a lost cause, because some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people will call our ideas eugenics whether we use the term or not, I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beg to differ.  Not all of the people who left the room in Anders' anecdote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have been offended by the ideas if the term &quot;eugenics&quot; hadn't been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introduced at the beginning.  Those are the people you could win over with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your ideas if you don't use terms that can be predicted to drive them away.
</em><br>
<p>That's not the point. The point is to illustrate the need to call the
<br>
fascists bluff, and try to educate people as to what is and is not
<br>
eugenics. The fascist luddites are claiming a definition that is not
<br>
supported by the facts or the historical context.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  And I don't see what it has to do with having a sense of humor.
</em><br>
<p>Eugene said that 'eugenics worked in my case'. Look at his name....
