<p>If your complaining about the regulations on building, hey I can sympathize.
<br>
My family has a framing business and I've had to hear about this my entire
<br>
life. If you arguing to keep the laws, what about my right to have a house
<br>
built as I see fit? What if I don't want 2 outlets per room but instead want
<br>
1? What if I decide I want to use pressed seaweed for wall paneling. By what
<br>
right did those people have control of my property? I would be obligated to
<br>
release all information required upon selling the house or it would be fraud
<br>
and therefore illegal. Also, I know TONS of licensed people that couldn't do
<br>
their jobs if their life depended on it, whereas I know people that aren't
<br>
licensed that are master craftsmen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I would be willing to bet a VERY large percentage of people sleeping under

<em>&gt;Hey Jerry, I'd advise you to check it out a little more thoroughly before
</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>It sure would be great if we could blame everything else in the world for
<br>
our position wouldn't it? I mean making the choice of having a child at 16
<br>
years old, or choosing to take a highly addictive drug certainly has to be
<br>
nature or societies fault right? Wait, that means that if its natures fault
<br>
that someone failed, then that also means those that have succeeded, got
<br>
their by accident as well! Wow, that explains why people make more then me,
<br>
its a fluke of nature. I feel so much better now knowing that it has nothing
<br>
to do with their work ethic and their desire to grow and expand themselves.
<br>
This also is the basis for a whole worldview where we have to try and
<br>
equalize these disparate discrepancies nature dishes out. We can play Robin
<br>
Hood, steal from the rich (why? they didn't earn it.. it was nature) and
<br>
give to the poor (why? they didn't have anything to do with the fact their
<br>
poor right?). Welcome to the universe where cause and effect doesn't exist,
<br>
you cant make yourself succeed or fail, you have to float on the ether and
<br>
accept what ya get. Poor bridge people, I feel so sorry for them now.
