<p><p>Poison gas works best when done low to the ground, *well* within the

<p><p>Actually, a .30-06 semi-auto is probably just about right for those stuck in
<br>
Kalifornia.  Cheap, capable ammunition for shooting down an unarmored
<br>
aircraft.  Naturally, you better be damn sure what you are doing if you try
<br>
such a thing; you'd hate to find out that you just shot down a Department of
<br>
Agriculture plane spraying for med flies again.
<br>
<p>The hard part is learning to shoot down an aircraft with a rifle, since
<br>
you'll never hit it if you aim at it even if it is headed directly at you.
<br>
It isn't exactly like you can practice, but you will discover that the
<br>
easy-to-find basic infantry manual that all U.S. soldiers are issued (and
<br>
which can be picked up cheap at used bookstores and gun shows) gives
<br>
explicit instructions on how to shoot at low flying aircraft from different
<br>
aspects.  It wouldn't be easy, but better than nothing.
