<p>Just for information - lead is not the best shield for EM emissions, like 
<br>
Tempest signals. Copper screen, with an opening small enough to act as a 
<br>
high-pass filter, or copper sheet is much more effective. A Faraday cage is 
<br>
all you really need, with attention paid to filtering of all power and 
<br>
signal wiring passing through the enclosure walls. Air vents can be 
<br>
shielded with copper mesh or sponge. Bonding of all parts to prevent &quot;slot 
<br>
antennas&quot; from being formed is also important., and door gasketing is 
<br>
critical. Only a thin sheet of copper is required.
<br>
<p>For MAGNETIC fields, you would need an annealed magnetic material in 
<br>
addition to the electrostatic shield. Fortunately, only low frequency 
<br>
magnetic signals will penetrate most copper shielding - above a few hundred 
<br>
Hertz, skin effect will start to have an effect. In any case, the signal 
<br>
strength drops off much faster than EM radiation.
<br>
<p>Lead is only needed to shield against X-rays and higher energy photons, 
<br>
which carry little information in this case.
<br>
<p>I wonder about using two or more &quot;decoy&quot; computers, of the same make and 
<br>
model as the secured one - driven by some sort of nonsense generator - 
<br>
perhaps a word processor that is reading in newspaper text via a pneumatic 
<br>
key actuator - the intent being to drown out the actual information.
<br>
<p>LCD displays should be much easier to shield than CRTs, also.
