<em>&gt; &gt; 1. The designers say it will.  No one is better

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; No, they do not say so.  
</em><br>
<p>I stand corrected.  
<br>
<p>Gene Leitl had written:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, nuke plants with a containment are claimed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be engineered to withstand the impact of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crashing plane.
</em><br>
<p>I based my statement on that.  My mistake. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Go read the press release
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the NRC.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.nrc.gov/OPA/gmo/nrarcv/01-112.html">http://www.nrc.gov/OPA/gmo/nrarcv/01-112.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is a specific Q and A from the above:
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; the NRC did not specifically contemplate attacks by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aircraft such as Boeing 757s or 767s and nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power plants were not designed to withstand such   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crashes.  Detailed engineering analyses of a large  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airliner crash have not yet been performed.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Note the phrasing above: &quot;...not designed to withstand
<br>
such crashes.&quot;  He is NOT saying &quot;...unable to
<br>
withstand such crashes.&quot;  I interpret this to mean
<br>
that they did not consider the destructive forces of
<br>
such a crash and design the structure so that it would
<br>
survive them.  This interpretation is supported by the
<br>
comment which follows: &quot;Detailed engineering analyses
<br>
of a large airliner crash have not yet been
<br>
performed.&quot;
<br>
<p>In other words, the containment building may or may
<br>
not survive such a crash, but the guy from the NRC
<br>
can't make a definitive statement without a thorough
<br>
and pointed engineering analysis.    
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Jeff, did you read my post from earlier today?  
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I appreciated your comments about older plants
<br>
having been designed when planes were smaller, and
<br>
about the vulnerability posed by unprotected on-site
<br>
storage of high-level waste, but not about engineering
<br>
practices and the effect of fire on reinforced
<br>
concrete.  Also, I find the liklihood of two impacts
<br>
on one nuke plant highly improbable after the events
<br>
of 9/11.  Perhaps you were suggesting what might have
<br>
been possible before 9/11.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&lt;snip some stuff&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I predict the plane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would go right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through and give you a nice fuel-air explosion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inside the containment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Ken
</em><br>
<p>I predict a splash around, a large but inconsequential
<br>
fire, and--worse case scenario--a cracked, maybe even
<br>
dented, containment building, the concrete held in
<br>
place by the reinforcing, with some medium-sized
<br>
chunks of concrete spalled off of the inside surface.
<br>
<p>Even if I were an expert--which I am not--without that
<br>
detailed engineering analysis, this would still be a
<br>
guess.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
