From: &quot;Lee Corbin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20Enoughness,%20was%20Re:%20Vicious%20Racism&In-Reply-To=&lt;00e601c11d1b$a4c3c360$cf5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; No.  That the vast majority of inventions did not occur in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tropical regions is factual.  If Fred Reed implied &quot;all&quot;, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that his point has to be understood in the context of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the claim that he was making about the wisdom of reparations.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's right. The real subject at hand was reparations, not racism. The
<br>
fact that Fred Reed shows how the reparations scheme is itself racist provides
<br>
another perspective from which to reject this absurd scheme, in addition to
<br>
the humorous angle. As long as we can laugh at the stupidity of such schemes,
<br>
they won't be able to harm the community at large. If US policy becomes so
<br>
insane as to take this nonsense seriously, then rational, reasonable, and
<br>
responsible scientists are at risk too.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, and ego.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity, the most
<br>
regressive force now operating in society.
