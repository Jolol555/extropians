I have been told (but have not independently confirmed), that at one
<br>
point, one high-profile African-American said that there was no more 
<br>
terrible feeling for him than to be walking down the street at night, 
<br>
hearing footsteps, and being _relieved_ when he saw that the other person 
<br>
was white.
<br>
<p>Yes. I expect that's especially terrible. I don't know if it's an -ism,
<br>
or prejudice, or just playing the odds. But he is male, FWIW.
<br>
<p>Doesn't directly contribute to the answering of these questions you pose.
