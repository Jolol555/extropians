<em>&gt; &gt; Hmm, do you mean that since some philosophers thought comprehension of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; eudaimonia was not possible for the many and the singularity is also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; incomprehensible, there is a link? That sounds rather far-fetched.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really? What exactly do you find far-fetched? It seems to me that in both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases there is said to be an epistemic gap between (t least some) humans and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those that are more godlike in their wisdom. If this epistemic similarity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not sufficient to constitute a link reflect on the fact that it seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raise the same sorts of ethical and political consequences. If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postsingularity beings are wiser than us then they may have a better idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what are eudaimonia consists in than we do; which is analogous to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position Plato attributes to the philosopher-king as compared with the hoi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polloi. Plato thought the philosopher-kings and the guardians would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified in bringing the many into line by force and deceit. Will the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postsingularity beings be similarly justified?
</em><br>
<p>I think you are mixing up the concept of the singularity with the
<br>
putative properties of posthumans. Using this way of reasoning christian
<br>
theology is clearly linked to eudaimonism, since God ought to be very
<br>
good at understanding eudaimonia. What Waldemar was originally pointing
<br>
out is that the singularity concept in our discourse tends to draw undue
<br>
attention to highly hypothetical futures which are also implied to be
<br>
unknowable and quite often appear static, and asking whether this
<br>
wouldn't limit our eudaimonic striving. 
<br>
<p>I agree with Charles that the idea of philosopher kings being justified
<br>
in using force to bring about their ideas is largely discredited. At
<br>
least I do not wish to support such behavior, neither of philosophers or
<br>
posthumans. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; To extend the analogy, they could just be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reflections from a puddle of water near the entrance. The eudaimonic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; issue is how to get out of the cave, and it is likely not helped by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intense study of the waves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not sure I understand your analogy but I think I agree if you mean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we ought not to focus exclusively on the limitations of our vision.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eudamonistic theory is always triparte: it has a theory of humans as they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are, humans as they should be if they realized their potential, and a theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about how to get from one to the other. Aristotle's metaphysical biology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gives him his theory of what humans should be, i.e., his theory about what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would be for us to fully realize our essence. His theory of education and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practical reasoning is supposed to help us get from where we are to where we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be. Of course for us education and pratical reasoning must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supplemented with a theory of how technology might allow us to turbo-charge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various aspects of ourselves. Unlike Aristotle, we must admit that our view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what kinds of beings we ought to be is not sufficiently clear; we might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to be wiser than we are in order to fully appreciate what our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eudaimonia consists in. Ours then is like the medieval quest where even the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; object of the quest is not fully cognized by its participants--we only see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our telos through a glass-darkly--and only becomes clearer during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; journey.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. There might also be the issue that the telos is not something
<br>
given, but something that will be defined by ourselves.
