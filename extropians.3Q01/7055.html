Robert Bradbury writes:
<br>
<p>&quot;First, I want to preface the discussion by explaining
<br>
to list members that over the last 6-8 years I've
<br>
spent an extensive amount of time (20-30% of my life)
<br>
in Russia.  That experience has fundamentally changed
<br>
my American perspective that everything is as it
<br>
&quot;appears to be&quot; to one of doubt, suspicion and
<br>
questioning that everything is *not* as it appears to
<br>
be.&quot;
<br>
<p>Assuming I understand you correctly, I would say that
<br>
I feel the same way.  I wonder just how widespread
<br>
this condition is.
<br>
<p>I see a completely different world than that portrayed
<br>
by the media, and by the average American (based on
<br>
what I perceive to be his/her view) .
<br>
<p>The media promotes and reinforces a certain view of
<br>
the world which I refer to as the cultural myth.  The
<br>
ruling elites (global oligarchy, ruling class, rich
<br>
and powerful--call them what you will) own the
<br>
overwhelming bulk of the media, and promulgate, within
<br>
their reach, that view which most effectively serves
<br>
their interests.
<br>
<p>When an individual sees past this deception--a
<br>
not-quite-conscious, not-entirely-external,
<br>
self-reinforcing-by-being-self-rewarding
<br>
self-deception--he quite understandably experiences
<br>
self-doubt.  &quot;How can I be right and everyone else be
<br>
wrong?&quot;  Dissent is self-correcting.  One finds
<br>
oneself wondering--because of its seeming greater
<br>
plausibility--if an explanation is to be found in
<br>
personal vanity, arrogance, elitism, or, sadly, in
<br>
plain old insanity.  &quot;I must be crazy to think I know
<br>
better and see clearer than everyone else.&quot;
<br>
<p>But I suspect the answer is to be found in simple
<br>
human psychology, a psychology which lies at the heart
<br>
of media's effectiveness in building and sustaining
<br>
acceptance of the fictional aspects of the cultural
<br>
myth.
<br>
<p>I call it: The Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome.  In
<br>
that folk fable, seeing the truth--the emperor
<br>
unclothed--was a mark of treason.  Speaking the truth,
<br>
clearly, implied correspondingly severe 
<br>
consequences.  Thus everyone would find
<br>
him-or-herself, initially, frightened into silence,
<br>
isolated by fear and self-doubt, convinced of their
<br>
social and ethical alienation by the seeming-unanimous
<br>
affirmation of the crowd.  Then, of course, to escape
<br>
the personal danger, they would add their own
<br>
&quot;huzzahs&quot; to the general acclaim.  Self-correcting and
<br>
self-reinforcing.  At first, *fooling* everyone
<br>
provides a certain tenuous sense of personal safety. 
<br>
Then, in an attempt to correct their unwanted and
<br>
seeming-mysterious failure of loyalty, they strive for
<br>
*belief* in the cultural fiction.
<br>
<p>The ruling class has exploited, often savagely,
<br>
everyone within its reach, with perfect historical
<br>
continuity, back to Ur.  The arabs/muslims have been
<br>
dominated, used, and--to whatever extent it has been
<br>
seen by those arabs/muslims as offensive--abused, in
<br>
modern times by the British imperial elite since
<br>
around the turn of the last century, and then in the
<br>
post-war era by the US elite.
<br>
<p>To my thinking, there is no better example of this,
<br>
and the corresponding disparity between truth and
<br>
cultural myth, than the case of Iran.  In the brief
<br>
moment of transition between British and American
<br>
hegemonies, Iran looked poised to embark on a course
<br>
of moderation and perhaps even democracy.  Then the
<br>
CIA, taking up where the British elite left off,
<br>
removed the upstart potential moderates, and replaced
<br>
them with a severe dictatorship.  The Shah, as I
<br>
believe is well known, used the petroleum resources of
<br>
oil-rich Iran to enrich the multinational oil
<br>
companies, the petrodollar handlers, the US armaments
<br>
manufacturers, himself, his clique of supporters, and
<br>
finally (I can't help but think of the term &quot;trickle
<br>
down&quot;) the Iranian nation.
<br>
<p>Under that foreign-installed dictatorship, political
<br>
opposition of any sort--most pointedly, moderate
<br>
political opposition--was brutally supressed.  The
<br>
only avenue remaining for the expression of the will
<br>
of the people was the ancient, unwavering,
<br>
intransigent bedrock of the muslim clerics.  The
<br>
mullahs and the Ayatollah.  I leave it to the reader
<br>
to assess the logic that suggests that the severity of
<br>
the dictatorship forged the countervailing severity of
<br>
the fundamentalism that eventually replaced it.    
<br>
<p>When the Shah was finally deposed, by cancer and
<br>
Islamic militancy, the US technical support for the
<br>
Iranian military was recalled to the US.  But not
<br>
before sabotaging much of the military inventory that
<br>
remained for the new regime.  In light of the losses
<br>
suffered in the Iran-Iraq war that followed, this
<br>
fact, added to the others, is likely remembered with
<br>
pointed bitterness among muslims.
<br>
<p>Regarding the Iran-Iraq war, I leave it to the reader
<br>
to investigate who started it, with what
<br>
justification, how it was prosecuted, who supported
<br>
whom, how many lives were lost, etc.  The muslims
<br>
know.  They know the agenda of the US power elite vis
<br>
a vis the muslim world.  And Osama Bin Laden knows as
<br>
well.
<br>
<p>Contrast this to what the &quot;average American&quot; knows. 
<br>
The Shah was an beacon of modernity, bringing progress
<br>
to an  impoverished, ignorant, and, all to often
<br>
violent region of the world.  When he was felled by
<br>
cancer, violent religious fanatics took over, led by
<br>
some kind of demon (the Ayatollah), who then proceeded
<br>
to attack and humiliate the US and its loving people,
<br>
the light of the world, by assaulting the US embassy,
<br>
and taking, holding, and tormenting 52 American
<br>
hostages for 444 days.
<br>
<p>Here's reality, here's malarkey.  Reality.  Malarkey. 
<br>
Reality.  Malarkey.  You be the judge.
<br>
<p>I'm reminded of a couple of lines from the song
<br>
&quot;Jokerman&quot; from Bob Dylan's &quot;Infidels&quot; album:    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;Freedom just around the corner for you
<br>
But with the truth so far off, what good will it do?&quot;
<br>
<p>As to Osama Bin Laden:  
<br>
<p>He was born into the Saudi ruling class.  I would
<br>
guess that to members of that class the scope of
<br>
ambition is effectively unlimited.  Osama Bin Laden
<br>
has a calling.  He is clearly qualified to fill the
<br>
crying need of muslims for justice in a treacherous
<br>
and hostile world. He is thrust into the role of the
<br>
great muslim hero/warrior/redeemer.  His social class,
<br>
resources, education, piety, and experience combine
<br>
with the events of his milieu to promote him along
<br>
that path.  What remains to be seen is whether,
<br>
inshallah, his piety and his tactical genius can
<br>
prevail against the forces of the hegemon.
<br>
<p>Despite Charlie's excellent factual essay, and the
<br>
immense power of the WTC tragedy to awaken people out
<br>
of their dream state, I seen very little opportunity
<br>
or inclination for people to find out what's really
<br>
going on.  Retaliation by &quot;terrorists &quot;against the US
<br>
will be supressed, paranoia and the police state will
<br>
be ratcheted up, but beyond that I expect just more of
<br>
the same. 
<br>
<p>Good luck,  Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
