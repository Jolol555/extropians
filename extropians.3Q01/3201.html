<p>Well, damn.  There is nothing new under the sun, it seems.  My attempt to
<br>
inject a bit of lightheartedness into a difficult discussion has failed.  {8-[
<br>
<p>I have listened quietly to these threads that have waded into the treacherous
<br>
waters of racism, and I have a few insights to offer.  Altho extropians is
<br>
my favorite list, I participate in six others.  As it turns out, the other
<br>
groups
<br>
also choke on the same issues that we have found so difficult here.  Do
<br>
allow me to expound.
<br>
<p>To compare and contrast, extropians contains some of the deepest and most
<br>
well thought out posts of any list I have ever found.  Extropians is also a
<br>
3 sigma case in the harshness of some of the posts.  As we all know, the
<br>
vitriol sometimes gets extreme.  Of all the lists, extropians seems to be
<br>
the most tolerant of off-topic discussions.  That being said, we fearlessly
<br>
deal with some very difficult topics here, racism being a prime example.
<br>
<p>The chess use group I once frequented was all very polite, kind and
<br>
gentle, until the day a few years ago that the first black man achieved
<br>
the noble rank of grandmaster.  Someone called attention to the fact,
<br>
and commented that this is something for which the black race can
<br>
be very proud, etc.  Then someone else commented that this man
<br>
should be congratulated upon reaching this rarified rank, something
<br>
that many of us strive for all our lives and damn few achieve, without
<br>
reference to his race.  Then all hell broke loose, on a list which had
<br>
never suffered a loose hell before.  Quite disturbing.  Of course it was
<br>
not long before the same list suffered a sexism loose-hell, because
<br>
someone observed that of the top 100 chess players in the world,
<br>
only one, the awesome Judit Polgar, was female.
<br>
<p>A British motorcycle list, of all things, tripped over privacy/openness
<br>
issues.  That list is about 3/4 Brits, bonney lads all, kind and gentle,
<br>
sharing information, trading parts, etc.  Someone mentioned those traffic
<br>
cameras that were going up everywhere on the Islands, pretty soon
<br>
world war 3 broke out there.
<br>
<p>A mathematics list I frequent carefully skirted the issue after someone
<br>
observed that the mathematics conferences were nearly all male and
<br>
lilly white.  A few harsh words were exchanged, the only example of
<br>
such I have ever seen on that list.
<br>
<p>The regular posters on this list are all people I consider my friends,
<br>
even those who piss me off on a regular basis.  It is painful to see
<br>
harsh words and attacks exchanged.  I acknowledge that I am one
<br>
who clowns around a lot on the extropians list, so perhaps my
<br>
exhortations are less compelling than they would otherwise be.
<br>
<p>I have concluded that there are a few hot-button issues which people
<br>
generally approach without open minds asking questions, but
<br>
rather with preconceived notions, seeking confirmation.  To those who
<br>
have decided to handle the racism issues and the other difficult ones,
<br>
do examine your own beliefs beforehand, and determine if you are
<br>
bringing to the table any preconceived notions, implanted perhaps
<br>
before you had any memetic immunity.  I know I have these, thus
<br>
my reluctance to comment.  Two examples of preconceived notions
<br>
would be 1) all people are born equal and 2) all people are born
<br>
unequal.
<br>
<p>Racism is an issue that has many unanswered questions and should
<br>
be dealt with, but do handle these issues carefully.  spike
