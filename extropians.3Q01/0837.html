Babylonian beer-brewing on the Internet
<br>
<p>Berlin's Vorderasiatisches Museum has published on the Internet 
<br>
more than 3,200 early cuneiform tablets from its storerooms.
<br>
<p>The digitisation of the Berlin cuneiform collection, one of the 
<br>
finest in the world, is part of an international project aimed at 
<br>
bringing together in a virtual Internet library the 
<br>
administrative archives of the city-states and empires of early 
<br>
Mesopotamia. The remains of these excavated archives, 4,000 years 
<br>
old, have ended up in museums all over the world. 
<br>
<p>Some of the texts are charmingly domestic - one, for instance, 
<br>
concerns deliveries of three sorts of beer to the palace and to a 
<br>
temple for offerings, giving the exact quantities of barley and 
<br>
other ingredients used in the brewing. 
<br>
<p>Seven of the most important museums are participating in the 
<br>
work, including the Parisian Louvre; the Hermitage in St. 
<br>
Petersburg; and the Yale Babylonian Collection in New Haven 
<br>
(USA). The pioneering work in Berlin was the result of a joint 
<br>
effort by the Museum, the Max Planck Institute for the History of 
<br>
Science, Berlin, and the University of California at Los Angeles.
<br>
<p>According to Robert Englund, from the University of California, 
<br>
Los Angeles: 'The Berlin collection documents the origin of 
<br>
writing better than any other in the world. The tablets 
<br>
illuminate the daily life of a world lost to us for thousands of 
<br>
years, beginning with the urban cultures of the 4th millennium BC 
<br>
and culminating in the great empire of the Ur III Dynasty at the 
<br>
end of the 3rd millennium, which united all of Mesopotamia in one 
<br>
administrative whole. We thus gain insights into cultural history 
<br>
reaching well beyond narrow inquiries.' 
<br>
<p>Special search and representational techniques have had to be 
<br>
developed to facilitate work on the content of the more than 
<br>
120,000 texts. Moreover, powerful translation programs will be 
<br>
required. Although cuneiform was deciphered more than 150 years 
<br>
ago, even specialists lack adequate aids in the evaluation of 
<br>
cuneiform literature. Lexical and grammatical glossaries are 
<br>
urgently needed, but also an historical reconstruction of the 
<br>
graphic development of cuneiform through time. 
<br>
<p>In its final form, the Cuneiform Digital Library is meant to 
<br>
contain not just all cuneiform tablets in text and image; diverse 
<br>
tools will also make it possible for scientists from other fields 
<br>
to work with the material. In this way, Assyriologists and 
<br>
Sumerologists will be joined by linguists, semioticists, 
<br>
historians of cognitive psychology, and also by social scientists 
<br>
engaged in the origins and administration of the first city-
<br>
states
