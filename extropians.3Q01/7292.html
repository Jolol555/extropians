<p>Also the current system dumps water on the fire, which wont
<br>
help this kind of fire: kerosene floats.  We would need a foaming
<br>
agent in the water.  Im not even sure that would work actually.
<br>
However, planes can be built that cannot be flown into buildings
<br>
or into the ground.
<br>
<p>During this whole episode, I have heard blame-the-victim memes
<br>
and every time it has caused me much distress.  But there is one
<br>
thing we have been guilty of as a society:  we have failed to use
<br>
all our technology to reduce our vulnerability to such attacks.
<br>
The Chicagoans of 1871 did not sit around plotting revenge on Mrs.
<br>
O'Leary's cow.  They did not form up a mob to destroy all of
<br>
cattledom.  They thought of ways to supress fires.
<br>
<p>We can do this!  We *can* make a society faaar more grand
<br>
than any we have imagined today, but we must figure out how
<br>
to protect ourselves from those who will oppose and destroy.
