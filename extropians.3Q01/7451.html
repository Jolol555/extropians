<em>&gt; FAA Plans to Disarm Flight Crews
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By Jeff Johnson
</em><br>
<p><p>This is all PR, purportedly to try to make the public feel more
<br>
confident
<br>
about air travel. In fact, the two hour waits and strip searches are
<br>
leaving
<br>
the airlines worse off than they would have been with no government
<br>
action
<br>
at all.  I was told by an airline pilot that they took away his Swiss
<br>
army
<br>
knife, which the pilots used to be required to carry. But at the same
<br>
time,
<br>
there's a crash ax in the cockpit--a tool with a sharp edge on one side
<br>
and
<br>
a pick on the other. And of course, ground crew are still not being
<br>
searched
<br>
at all. The other rules that came out this a.m., such as who can fly VFR
<br>
where, are of the same level of intelligence as the airport security
<br>
rules.
<br>
<p>One of the main problems is that the NSC is promulgating these rules,
<br>
and
<br>
they either don't have or aren't listening to advisors who know
<br>
something
<br>
about the airline industry. Or they do have and are listening, but their
<br>
goal is to harm the industry. I wouldn't be surprised if the airlines
<br>
are
<br>
nationalized before this is all over. This is an illustration of what's
<br>
wrong with centrallized control of an economy. If we end up with
<br>
centralized
<br>
control of agriculture, I can guarantee there will be famine.
