<em>&gt; &gt; I couldn't take this test!  I had to give up after only four questions!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Here they are:  (for each, your only choices are strongly agree, agree,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; disagree, and strongly disagree)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1. If globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The assumption is that the interests of the trans-national
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; corporations are antithetical to those of humanity!  [I meant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do not have any overlap.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Corporations are legal entities with many of the rights of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings. They have their own interests and agendas which are distinct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from those of the human beings who are members of them. (Corporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; officers are charged with a duty of pursuing the interests of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporation and can be fired or even sued if they let their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferences get in the way.)
</em><br>
<p>The implication being that corporations shouldn't have &quot;their own&quot;
<br>
interests, or that those officers shouldn't be so charged?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Was the WSPQ (World's Shortest Political Quiz) this loaded, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; simply couldn't recognize it because I'm a libertarian?  This is scary!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To my (non-American) eyes the answer is &quot;yes, it was&quot;.  Be scared!
</em><br>
<p>Why didn't you point out that it was loaded at the time?  No one
<br>
said anything of the kind.  Weren't we left thinking that the
<br>
test was non-biased?
<br>
<p>Yes, what is scary is that objectivity has eluded us once more.
<br>
<p>But what is infinitely more scary is a second possiblity:  that
<br>
indeed the World's Shortest Political Quiz is mainly objective, 
<br>
that this one on the contrary is to a great degree *more* loaded,
<br>
and that many people who agree with the objectives of this later
<br>
quiz don't mind it being so.
<br>
<p>In other words, what is really scary is when even slight injustices
<br>
aren't confessed as such when they are in the service of ideology.
<br>
It's another case of the good ends justifying the not-so-good means.
