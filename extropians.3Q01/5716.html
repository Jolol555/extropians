<p>Thank you. There are some graphs and claims at this link:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0134.html?m%3D1">http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0134.html?m%3D1</a>
<br>
<p>But the input data is not cited, and the Y-axis is anything but clear to me
<br>
for the more sweeping graphs. Mass use of inventions, paradigm shift rate --
<br>
these are useful things to look at, but where are the inputs? There are no
<br>
references. There hasn't been a paradigm shift in physics, for instance,
<br>
since quantum physics was developed eighty years ago. Life expectancy, as
<br>
shown, is not exponential, but linear. Economic graphs like education and
<br>
manufacturing seem rather beside the point, as do graphs of recently
<br>
invented technologies such as &quot;growth in e-commerce&quot;, &quot;resolution of
<br>
noninvasive brain scanning devices,&quot; &quot;internet backbone bandwidth,&quot; and &quot;dna
<br>
sequencing cost.&quot; If all these technology graphs reach their maxima
<br>
tomorrow, that does not equal any kind of social revolution. It just means
<br>
DNA can be sequenced cheaply, lots of things can be bought online (even
<br>
though people still prefer physical shops), bandwidth is dirt cheap, and
<br>
researchers can do better brain research. Shall I order the party hats now?
<br>
<p>There needs to be some measure of social impact of technology, and I'm not
<br>
seeing that. Looking back at my life, which is just short of forty years
<br>
long, I feel that the only major invention which has caused anything like a
<br>
social revolution is the personal computer. Other than that, I'm still in
<br>
the world of cars, running water, electric lights, audio playback,
<br>
airplanes, atom bombs, and television that my parents inhabited. My
<br>
television is better -- I just watched the &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; DVD on my laptop
<br>
in the bathtub -- but it's not basically different. Ditto my CD player
<br>
compared to a phonograph. My car has more features but it's still basically
<br>
just a car.
<br>
<p>If anything, the last fifty years seem like something of a lull for
<br>
technologically-induced social revolution. There were more socially
<br>
important things invented and deployed in the seventy-five years before 1951
<br>
than in the fifty years after.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think one can look at aggregate values, like energy production per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capita, or the efficiency of various motors/generators to get an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimate of overall changes.
</em><br>
<p>I also don't think (as I mentioned with respect to Moore's Law and
<br>
population growth) that isolated exponential graphs demonstrate much. Has
<br>
anyone done graphs of miles traveled per capita per year in the first few
<br>
decades after the train was deployed, for instance, or casualties per
<br>
bowman-hour in the century after the invention of the longbow? I wonder if
<br>
they are any less exponential.  Without some such control data, it seems
<br>
difficult to support the hypothesis that there is something special about
<br>
today's technological advances compared to those of previous centuries.
<br>
<p>There would need to be some metric of social significance, and again, I'm
<br>
just not seeing that. All I see on that point is hand-waving. The number of
<br>
patents issued is going up, therefore we will all be supermen by 2030. Huh?
<br>
There may be more research and scientific advance going on, but most of it
<br>
is at the fringes of society, and what progress it contributes to people's
<br>
lives seems incremental rather than revolutionary, with a very small number
<br>
of exceptions like the PC.
<br>
<p>The cancer survival rate creeps up but there's no cure for cancer. Contra
<br>
the predictions of science fiction writers, we're not off for weekend jaunts
<br>
to the moon, although getting to Sri Lanka is cheaper and faster than it
<br>
was. AI seems as far away as ever. Voice recognition is here, and what do
<br>
you know, it doesn't seem all that terribly important after all. There's no
<br>
power too cheap to meter. And so on. None of these predicted revolutions
<br>
have happened, but we're being asked to swallow another one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Every one of the last eight centuries at least has seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; major technological changes from the previous century.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Which is what you would see if there was an acceleration - every time is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fastest yet. If it was slowing, we would see more advances in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past and a clearer &quot;golden age&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Right. Make no mistake, I think there have been many centuries of
<br>
technological revolution, and I'm sure we're poised for more. What I don't
<br>
get is the assertion that the technological revolutions we're about to see
<br>
have some singular transcendental quality not possessed by any of the
<br>
revolutions of the past. Humans have been reinventing themselves since there
<br>
have been humans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In general, I think you are right to ask for evidence. Far too many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common assumptions people believe are based on very rickety evidence.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed. I'm a skeptic by nature. My intuition tells me there may be
<br>
something to this idea of accelerating technological progress, but when I
<br>
sit down and try to figure out how to justify it, I'm not seeing much of a
<br>
solid basis. Since there are people here who are almost religiously
<br>
dedicated to the concept, I thought I'd see if any of them could do better.
