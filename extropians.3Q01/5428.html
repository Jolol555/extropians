<em>&gt; &gt; This doesn't make any sense to me.  My problem with most of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seeing my packaging rather than who I am as a person.  They have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bad opinions toward lesbians say and since I am one of them they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see their opinions of lesbians instead of simply seeing me.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is not me putting myself in a box or boxes but me fighting to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seen as person first and all these various properties of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; person second.  People come and a wonderful assortment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; flavors.  Be sure to collect the entire set! &lt;g&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we fight to be seen as an individual, and in the same hand start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preaching the glory of diversity for its own sake, and no one else sees the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradiction?
</em><br>
<p>There is not a contradiction but a paradox.  Both are perfectly
<br>
valid and, ideally, there is balance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for diversity, what factors do we want to be diverse in? If I own a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; company, Ill be sure to hire those with an extra finger and those without.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also those that have the letter G in their last name and those without. Get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my point? What the hell does diversity have to do with the form or function
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of any organization except maybe on the political layer?
</em><br>
<p>Nothing at all if applied stupidly.  Everything if you find
<br>
yourself making decisions on the basis of a person's skin
<br>
pigment or gender instead of on how that individual can be good
<br>
to include in your enterprise.  Hiring because of differences is
<br>
as dumb as not hiring because of differences not relevant to the
<br>
work at hand.
