Several people have indicated their interest in better
<br>
understanding and helping to spread the information
<br>
in Report #TL07B: THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07b.shtml">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07b.shtml</a>&gt; and
<br>
related reports.
<br>
<p>I think the best starting point is to compile an
<br>
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THINKING SKILLS. Several
<br>
thinking skills are specifically mentioned in the
<br>
above report.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that most people attempting to read
<br>
&quot;Nature-of-Government&quot;-type information have great
<br>
difficulty processing the information because they
<br>
lack the thinking skills for doing so.
<br>
<p>More specific thinking skills are mentioned in the
<br>
other Clear-Your-Mind Reports
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/dir_clear.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/dir_clear.htm</a>&gt;.
<br>
<p>In 1986 I did something called &quot;Postural Integration&quot;
<br>
(similar to &quot;Rolfing&quot;). At one point I asked my PI
<br>
Practitioner what he thought about humans consuming
<br>
cow's milk. He said that some people thought it was a
<br>
good idea, others thought it a bad idea -- &quot;it's all just
<br>
opinion.&quot;
<br>
<p>I realized that he had no thinking skills for making a
<br>
&quot;correct&quot; conclusion on the issue. By &quot;correct&quot; I mean,
<br>
&quot;the best conclusion one can make, subject to the
<br>
information currently available.&quot;)
<br>
<p>&quot;We live in a world of fantasy, a world of illusion. The
<br>
great  task in life is to find reality.&quot; -- Iris Murdoch, Times
<br>
interview
<br>
<p>Noam Chomsky interviewed by Continuum Magazine --
<br>
Noam Chomsky on AIDS
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www2.prestel.co.uk/littleton/nc_aids.htm">http://www2.prestel.co.uk/littleton/nc_aids.htm</a>&gt;:
<br>
&quot;Q: What tools does a social analyst like yourself use
<br>
to distinguish between illusion and material reality?
<br>
Noam Chomsky: If any tools are known, I'm unaware
<br>
of them. We use our intelligence, as best we can.&quot;
<br>
<p>Chomsky may not have been particularly deficient in
<br>
thinking skills when he said the above. It could simply
<br>
be that he had never thought in terms of identifying and
<br>
describing specific thinking skills as tools he uses to
<br>
distinguish between illusion and reality.
<br>
<p>One thinking skill has to do with &quot;Identifying the Crux
<br>
of the Matter.&quot; In the case of so-called &quot;AIDS,&quot; there are
<br>
several &quot;cruxes&quot;:
<br>
1. Is there really a disease that can legitimately be called
<br>
&quot;AIDS?&quot; (Or is it a linguistic fantasy created by definition,
<br>
repetition, and acceptance by the credulous?)
<br>
2. Is there any evidence that &quot;HIV causes AIDS?&quot;
<br>
3. How reliable are the &quot;HIV tests?&quot; (I've seen claims that
<br>
there are more than 60 conditions or diseases that can
<br>
cause false positives. Reportedly, because of different
<br>
standards, the same test on the same person with the
<br>
same outcome will result in an HIV-positive declaration
<br>
in one country andan HIV-negative declaration in another.)
<br>
4. Is an HIV-positive declaration a kind of &quot;psychological
<br>
death sentence&quot; for many?
<br>
5. Overall, are &quot;AIDS-drugs&quot; beneficial or harmful?
<br>
6. Who benefits most from the perpetuation of the &quot;HIV
<br>
causes AIDS&quot; orthodoxy?
<br>
<p>For a directory of websites that question &quot;HIV causes AIDS,&quot;
<br>
see &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/aidsdir.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/aidsdir.htm</a>&gt;.
<br>
<p>Analyzing so-called &quot;AIDS&quot; and forming &quot;correct&quot; conclusions
<br>
requires the application of a large number of specific thinking
<br>
skills that can be identified, named, and described.
<br>
<p>Failure to apply such thinking skills can be a matter of life
<br>
and death. Libertarian author Peter McWillams
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.mcwilliams.com/">http://www.mcwilliams.com/</a>&gt;
<br>
may have died primarily because of taking &quot;AIDS drugs.&quot;
<br>
Had he mastered and applied proper thinking skills to
<br>
his situation, he might have enjoyed many more years
<br>
of healthy life.
<br>
<p>For details of his death, see The Life and Death of Peter
<br>
McWilliams
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.cannabisnews.com/news/thread6340.shtml">http://www.cannabisnews.com/news/thread6340.shtml</a>&gt;.
<br>
<p>Each thinking skill can be identified, named, and described.
<br>
Some examples of its use can be given. Exercises can be
<br>
developed to enable anyone to master each thinking skill.
<br>
<p>The thinking skills can be published on BuildFreedom.com
<br>
or on a separate special website.
<br>
<p>I suggest that anyone interested in participating in the
<br>
development of the Encyclopedia Thinking Skills subscribe
<br>
to the Deep Anarchy List, which could be used to discuss
<br>
and coordinate the activities involved. You can subscribe by
<br>
