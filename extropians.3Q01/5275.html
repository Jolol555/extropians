<p><em>&gt; Russell writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Maybe I'm missing something, but when I say I like diversity I simply
</em><br>
mean
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that I like living in a world where people have widely different life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; styles, interests, self-presentations, sexualities etc. I don't want to
</em><br>
live
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in a world where everyone is the same. I like variety.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Lee seems to have expressed not so much a contrary wish to this (though
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may be what he feels) as an objection to identity politics built around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these things. If that is so I have some sympathy, though I'd say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; identity politics is sometimes necessary for people with unpopular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; characteristics to pursue more tolerance, better legal rights etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Can you clarify what you don't like, Lee? Is it a variety of different
</em><br>
kinds
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of people? Or is it the (sometimes necessary, I would say) evil of
</em><br>
identity
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; politics?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I dislike individuals being replaced, in effect, by groups.  Now the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups may indeed arise from history and geography, and what not, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be real.  But it's false for people to identify with their group at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the expense of seeing themselves and feeling themselves to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals.  Identity *politics* is only a part, but an important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part, of this.
</em><br>
<p>Lee, is it really all so black and white (no pun intended)?  Can't an
<br>
individual be an individual, and still have sentimental ties to his or her
<br>
family (from Poland, let's pretent), Eastern European food, and music in the
<br>
minor scale?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When I was 18, I was running a junior chess program for the city.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An eleven year old suddenly asked me, &quot;Are you Catholic?&quot;.  When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I answered &quot;No&quot; I could see that a little barrier had sprung up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between us.  That's one aspect.
</em><br>
<p>When I was nearly 9 (my first winter in the United States), I noticed Jewish
<br>
children were excluded from the &quot;Christmas&quot; festivities at my elementary
<br>
school.  I was sad for them - it seemed unecessary, and I could not feel
<br>
very festive when some of the kids were left out.  The seeds of freethought
<br>
really sprouted in me that year.  (In prior years, I was spared having to
<br>
observe what schools in Rio de Janeiro did regarding Christmas festivities
<br>
as the seasons there were reversed -- December was a summer vacation month.)
<br>
So, maybe we agree on the potentially divisive nature of religions.
<br>
<p>But until we control the genes
<br>
<em>&gt; that determine racial groupings, we're helpless against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divisions that naturally arise, say, between whites and blacks.
</em><br>
<p>How did you make this jump from religion -- to &quot;racial groupings?&quot;
<br>
(Control the genes that determine racial groupings ... WHAT?)  In your
<br>
opinion - what exactly is a racial grouping?  And what are these divisions
<br>
which you think naturally arise between whites and blacks?  I'm suppressing
<br>
an overwhelming urge to write in all capital letters.  Do you have any
<br>
friends (I mean, really good friends) who are of a different &quot;race?&quot;  I use
<br>
the term loosely -- because &quot;race&quot; is scientifically invalid.  I can attest
<br>
that there are no divisions that NATURALLY arise between whites and blacks
<br>
or whites and Asians - my husband is Irish and black, my three grandchildren
<br>
are half Vietnamese and half European, and we one happy -- and lucky --
<br>
family.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The diversity that you are speaking of---which is not what people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are usually meaning when they use the term---&quot;people have widely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different life styles, interests, self-presentations, sexualities etc.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is fairly harmless.  But what is the use of cultural diversity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for example?  None.  So far as I can tell, it limits people, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allows them and others to pigeonhole, and fosters divisiveness.
</em><br>
<p>You yourself belong to a culture, right?  Is it of any use to you?  (I guess
<br>
I don't really understand your question very well.)  It seems to me you are
<br>
looking at ethnic groups other than your own as the potentially pesky &quot;other
<br>
cultures&quot; ... if that's so, it seems a rather ethnocentric view.
<br>
