Not sure you're right, there.
<br>
<p>Consider the cellphone. The USA is somewhat behind the curve due to a
<br>
crippling failure to standardize digital cellphones early on, but over
<br>
here ownership has passed 60% of the population and is still rising. (You
<br>
see pre-teen kids with cellphones so their parents can keep track of
<br>
them when they're playing out, for example.)
<br>
<p>Ultimately I expect the mobile phone to have a comparable degree of social
<br>
impact to the automobile.
<br>
<p>The fixed land-line phone connected _places_ -- the cellphone connects
<br>
_people_. For the first time you can contact a _person_ wherever they are.
<br>
This is a subtle distinction but one with huge long-term implications,
<br>
especially as the kind of data we can cram down a cellular link expands
<br>
to include video (thanks, Nokia) and medium-bandwidth digital stuff.
<br>
<p>Want an anti-mugger device? Wear a camera or two and continuously spool
<br>
a DivX stream back to your home server via your phone. Want a business
<br>
with no offices? All you need is a palmtop computer and a mobile for
<br>
every employee. Want to ensure your kid is staying in school and not
<br>
playing truant? Interrogate their mobile phone's whereabouts. The social
<br>
implications are *only just* beginning to work themselves out -- it'll
<br>
take at least another generation to become clear just what the impact
<br>
of the personal cellphone is for society -- but it's already caused huge
<br>
changes in the decade since they started to become common.
<br>
<p>This is a one-off item, and not one I can put a quantitative figure on
<br>
(especially because it's a change-in-progress). But I think there are other
<br>
socially revolutionary technologies that are slipping in under the radar
<br>
and that you may have missed. For example, advances in food preparation
<br>
technology in factories have turned the TV dinner from a soggy cardboard-
<br>
tasting novelty into something that many people eat every day, to the point
<br>
where many no longer _need_ to know how to prepare food from raw ingredients
<br>
like vegetables, spices and a cut of meat. That activity used to soak up
<br>
maybe ten to twenty hours of work time per household per week -- what is
<br>
replacing it?
<br>
<p>Again: the RAF noted recently that the reflex speed of new applicants for
<br>
pilot training is vastly higher than their equivalents during the Battle of
<br>
Britain -- by 1940 standards, every applicant today has the reflexes to be
<br>
an ace. They blame the widespread adoption of computer games that foster
<br>
lightning hand-eye coordination skills. Who'd have expected son-of-Pong to
<br>
have serious defense implications in 1976? And what are the implications for
<br>
teleoperator-controlled surgery in, say, a decade's time, when that same
<br>
video generation begins graduating from medical school?
<br>
<p>All this without mentioning the Flynn effect.
