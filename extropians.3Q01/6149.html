</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't know that there's anything particularly innovative about
<br>
these two ideas (and one involves guns, sort of), but anyway:
<br>
<p>* Arm and train all flight crew in antiterrorism measures.  If the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;entire crew has handguns, you'll need a large number of terrorists
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to hijack a flight.  The political hurdles facing this policy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;should be relatively low, as we're not talking about arming
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;private individuals, rather airline employees, who would only be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;armed while on duty.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
* Make the cockpit, and perhaps the entire plane transparent to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the outside world in realtime:  audio and perhaps other feeds
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;would be continuously be sent to the ground.  Any abnormality
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;detected would immediately alert human monitors, who could take
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;appropriate action, from negotiation to shooting the plane down.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the worst case, where the terrorists still succeded in some
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fashion, we'd at least have a wealth of information about what
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;happended and who did it, much more than we have now from a few
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;chance cell calls.  I'm not generally a fan of surveilance,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;but I think privacy issues are of less concern on a plane since
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you're already identified and subject to search, and if applied
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;only to the cockpit, only the privacy of airline employees would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;be compromised, not that of private individuals/passengers.
<br>
<p>Note:  although I fly somewhat regularly, I'm completely ignorant
<br>
of airline operations, so I suspect the above ideas are unworkable
<br>
for reasons I'm unaware of.
<br>
<p>I've also barley followed the transparency and gun debates here,
<br>
but the above made a &quot;solution&quot; to both pop into my head:  Everyone
<br>
has a choice between being armed and privacy.  Anyone may be armed
<br>
(broadly speaking -- include guns, weapons of mass destruction)
<br>
but while armed, they must be completely transparent/monitorable
<br>
in realtime.  I don't advocate this policy and see many obvious
<br>
problems, but it could make an interesting story.
