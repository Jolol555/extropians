<em>&gt; &gt; That said, their AI theory most certainly appears to suck, and I would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their chance of passing the Turing test in ten years at zero, unless the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; organization shifts to a completely new theory.  My guess is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; incoherent babblings they've achieved are every bit as dumb as they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; appear, and not simple cases of something that could scale up to greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complexity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I was disturbed by their examples, as well.  They claimed that they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nonsensical in the sense of a child's ramblings.  That did not appear to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be the case.  Children do not randomly make non sequitur.  They play
</em><br>
<em>&gt;games, have imaginary friends, and change topics frequently.  But they do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not accidentally pull up the wrong information from their brain and spew it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out in answer to the wrong question.  I also didn't understand the concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the computer wanting bananas on a trip.  Unless this is an android that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simulates eating and has taste sensors, this is meaningless.  How did the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computer &quot;learn&quot; to &quot;like&quot; bananas?  If it can't eat, how does it &quot;like&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them.  This does not compare to a child who likes bananas.  I found the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;examples to be more counter-examples of AI.  (Unfortunately!)
</em><br>
<p>The impression I got was that it wanted to take bananas for the monkeys, 
<br>
because it had learned that monkeys like bananas.  I could be wrong tho.

<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man.

Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
