<p><p>Good point.  I will have to ponder this some.
<br>
<p>I do think, however, that there is an element of blaming the victim
<br>
involved in any such arguement.  I could buy this in the bombing of the
<br>
barracks in Lebanon and Saudi Arabi, and the attack on the USS Cole,
<br>
and even many of the attacks on civilians over the years, but I
<br>
can't help but feel that there is something inherently different about
<br>
the events in New York and Washington.  
<br>
<p>I also can't help but fear that this has now changed from tit-for-tat to
<br>
war to the knife, and I am sick because of it.

<p><p><p><em>&gt; Rape is a particularly inapropos image, of course, since the mind-infected

</em><br>
<em>&gt; fucking in heaven for eternity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cf: <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/june01/2001-06-26-suicide-usat.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/june01/2001-06-26-suicide-usat.htm</a>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	In return for &quot;martyrdom,&quot; Hamas tells the youths that their families will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be financially compensated, their pictures will be posted in schools and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mosques, and they will earn a special place in heaven.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           They also are promised something more risqué: unlimited sex with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 72 virgins in heaven. The Koran, the sacred book of Islam, describes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; women as &quot;beautiful like rubies, with complexions like diamonds and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pearls.&quot; In one of the passages of the Koran, it is said the martyrs and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virgins shall &quot;delight themselves, lying on green cushions and beautiful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carpets.&quot; Since the time of Mohammed, martyrs have always been considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those willing to die defending Islam.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           For some young Muslims, that offer is too much to turn down.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           &quot;I know my life is poor compared to Europe or America, but I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something awaiting me that makes all my suffering worthwhile,&quot; says Bassam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Khalifi, 16, a Hamas youth leader in Gaza's Bureij refugee camp. &quot;Most boys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't stop thinking about the virgins.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           But in the end, says Shaked, the Israeli terrorism expert, most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the bombers don't sign up for martyrdom for the promise of unlimited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sex. &quot;They join because of their absolute devotion to God and their desire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to die with Jewish blood on their hands,&quot; he says. &quot;It's not a heroic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing, it's a holy thing.&quot;
