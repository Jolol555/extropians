<em>&gt;On Miriam English's point above: the US system is NOT privatized.  It's

</em><br>
<p>My point above (even though it is really only a side issue to my main 
<br>
point) still stands. You are simply arguing that it is not as privatised as 
<br>
it could be. Undoubtedly that is true. What I said was that the US health 
<br>
market is probably the most privatised in the world. It is also the most 
<br>
expensive. To get a broken leg fixed in US is way more expensive than in 
<br>
Australia. (Forget drugs -- just basic health care: x-ray, cast, 
<br>
physiotherapy.) Australia has mostly had a publicly funded health system in 
<br>
the past. In recent years politicians who have been mesmerised by the 
<br>
economic rationalist religion have been dismantling that and the costs for 
<br>
health have been rising as a result. One of our states, Queensland, has 
<br>
always had the most public hospital system in Australia. Health care in 
<br>
that state is cheap and universal, and the same high quality elsewhere in Oz.
<br>
<p>Health is just one of the things that I believe the capitalist system 
<br>
manages very badly. It is great for many other things, and in fact it is 
<br>
even good at certain aspects of medicine. But take balance and control out 
<br>
of the health system and it is like cutting the brake lines on a car: it 
<br>
may get you somewhere very fast but do you really want to be on board when 
<br>
it gets there?
<br>
<p>Please understand: I am not anti-capitalist. I'm not socialist, communist, 
<br>
capitalist, marxist... The thing that most closely describes my position is 
<br>
anarchist, but I am not really even that. I don't think any one system has 
<br>
all the answers. Human society is way too complex and humans too 
<br>
unpredictable and too prone to do irrational things. It is very attractive 
<br>
to look for a simple answer to complicated questions, but maybe some 
<br>
complex questions just don't have simple, clean answers.
<br>
<p>I actually think capitalism is a very cool way to accomplish many things, 
<br>
but I also recognise it is bad at some things. To ignore its failures and 
<br>
excesses is risky. I think an economy should be seen as an ecology where 
<br>
many systems fill particular niches and work as controls on each other. 
<br>
Remember that when one highly efficient plant dominates an ecology we call 
<br>
it a weed.  :-)
<br>
<p>Best wishes,

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
