<p>Ack!  Please note I did not write what was attributed to me above (I
<br>
recognized the mistake immediately, as I don't think or talk that way,
<br>
yipes).  The post was from me, but I was quoting something Mike Lorrey had
<br>
said:
<br>
<p>[snip]... Mike Lorrey has written &quot;[But] there are different types of
<br>
racists as well.
<br>
Those who think that someone needs to meet a lower standard just because of
<br>
their skin color to get the same job or to be accepted into college, or
<br>
someone who thinks that someone who is 7 generations separated from their
<br>
enslaved ancestors deserves 'reparations', is themselves a racist&quot;). [snip]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It wasn't until I got my first computer job that I met people on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regular basis who I regarded as intelligent as I was.
</em><br>
<p>It's interesting you should mention this.  Reminds me when I read of black
<br>
men who went into the armed services (the time frame for this was somewhere
<br>
between WWII and the beginning of the Civil Rights era), finding themselves
<br>
around white men for virtually the first time of their lives - and
<br>
discovering that not all white men were smart (and simultaneously figuring
<br>
out - they've been hoaxed!).
<br>
<p>I'm no
<br>
<em>&gt; super-genius, but have seen high school test scores that (somehow) gave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me an IQ of a little over 140. I think most smart people agree that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't regard themselves as smart so much as they regard most other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people as stupid. I can imagine a black person thinking I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discriminating because of his or her skin color but unless they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; challenge me intellectually I may ignore or dismiss them, just as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might dismiss most other stupid people, regardless of race.
</em><br>
<p>Charm knows no color line, huh?
