<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I have just listened to Duncan Moon's September 18 piece on Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction to the terrorist attacks on the United States.  I do not doubt the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sincerity of the moderate Islamic clerics who spoke in this piece, but I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubt that Mr. Moon knows anything about Islam and especially about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; central scripture of that religion, the Koran.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Like the rest of the U.S. press corps, Mr. Moon has passed on without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question the statements by moderate Muslims that &quot;Islam does not endorse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violence.&quot;  We will not as a nation come to understand how and why the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events of September 11 occurred until we take the time to study Islam and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop an understanding of how a large number of people in the world use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion to justify violence.  The simple and undisputable fact is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is clear and explicit language in the Koran that:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &lt;&gt; endorses the use of violence against &quot;unbelievers&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &lt;&gt; requires that Islamic countries institute legal discrimination against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-Muslims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &lt;&gt; demands unequal treatment of women
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You could say the same of the Bible yet most Christians today do not believe
<br>
that their religion mandates that they act like Islamic fundamentalists or
<br>
turn the country into a theocracy.  Now it is true that there are some
<br>
Christians in the US and elsewhere that do believe this and historically
<br>
there have been entire countries that believed this. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How do we, as a free people, come to terms with these facts?  How do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moderate Muslims rationalize their calls for peace and tolerance in light of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the clear and unambiguous text of their scripture to the contrary?  How can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy flourish in cultures where a religion based on that scripture is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enshrined in law?  These are the hard questions that our contemporary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural relativism apparently makes it impossible to ask.  By dodging these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions, NPR does not encourage a pursuit of truth, but rather becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicit in our civilization's unwillingness to come to terms with them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Modern Muslims justify peace and tolerance the same way moderate Christians 
<br>
do.  You could find scriptures in both holy books that put down such 
<br>
tolerance and you could find other scriptures that can be and are used to
<br>
justify it.  So?  
<br>
<p>What would you suggest?  Are you going to try to tell moderate and liberal
<br>
Muslims that they aren't good Muslims and should either drop the entire business
<br>
or start a jihad?  Are you going to tell Christians that they should stone
<br>
adulterers in the streets or drop the entire business?  Or are you going to accept
<br>
and nurture what tolerance is to be had regardless of people's religious
<br>
belief structures?
<br>
<p>How tolerant would it be to only tolerate the unreligious?
