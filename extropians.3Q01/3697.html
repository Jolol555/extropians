<p><em>&gt;&gt; now can we get back an address the issue? Is Jesse Jackson a racist?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is almost a trick question.  Jackson's original quote said that he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ashamed to have this distinction between blacks and whites in his mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore, he seems to be giving an example of where even he has racial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prejudice and/or discrimination in his mind.  However, he gives this as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example of what we need to stop doing.
</em><br>
<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that he was in effect making a
<br>
statement about black crime rates, and not engaging in self-criticism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So is he a racist?  No.  He seems to be admitting that racism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a common and natural feeling that we all need to fight to overcome.
</em><br>
<p>So now we can have &quot;common&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; feelings of racism,
<br>
without being racist?  This is wrecking the terminology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He admits some racist thoughts, but is fighting to end racism.
</em><br>
<p>I predict that Jackson would (rightfully IMO) deny that he
<br>
has racist thoughts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Therefore, I don't really care if we call these attitudes racist, prejudice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or discrimination.  To link unrelated traits to race is racist.  To make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions based on race rather than people's individual merits is racist.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that getting too involved in definitions, then coming up with
<br>
new ones, and then expecting everyone to abide by the new ones is crazy.
<br>
But I think that your usage here of what is &quot;racist&quot; is overbroad, and
<br>
you will end up saying (like you did above) that Jesse Jackson has
<br>
racist (against blacks) thoughts, and that it was racist for the person
<br>
walking down the street to be relieved (in that neighborhood) that the
<br>
person behind him was white.
<br>
<p>Now it should be understood that statistics probably dictates that in
<br>
*some* neighborhoods in the United States, one would be relieved to find
<br>
that there was a black person walking behind them.  One possible locale,
<br>
conceivably, could be South Boston.  But in that case, it would be
<br>
equally ridiculous to suppose that then one was being &quot;racist&quot;
<br>
against whites.
<br>
<p>My usage of the term needs criticism:  &quot;A racist is someone who is 
<br>
automatically antagonistic towards someone else just because of 
<br>
that person's race.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is there any good reason to split hairs with these terms, except to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to practice prejudice and discrimination while claiming not to be racist?
</em><br>
<p>Harvey, please give some of the people here more credit than that.
<br>
Like you, many really do want to come to the truth about a very
<br>
difficult issue.
<br>
<p>Lee
