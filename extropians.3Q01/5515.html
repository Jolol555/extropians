<p><em>&gt;I have a personal ax to grind with unions though. When I left the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;US Air Force, Boeing had dropped their job offer to me, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;IBEW refused to recognise ANY of my military training as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aircraft electrician. They demanded that I go through their two
</em><br>
<em>&gt;year apprenticeship school and three years more after that working
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for $7 an hour (in Seattle) with no advancement whatsoever from my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;military experience. I told them to stuff it. I figured that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that was how unions 'protected' workers, they were frauds. All
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they are is seniority protectionist rackets.
</em><br>
<p>Must have been that branch Mike, The IBEW took my experience into
<br>
account, I made journeyman in two years. Of course that was as a
<br>
&quot;C&quot; or communications electrician. I used to supplement my income
<br>
as a bouncer/manager at a 4:00am stop and sock (Bar).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; My job isn't going to Mexico Jerry, and never will.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;That's because you are a skilled laborer, Brian. However, don't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;too surprised to be replaced some time in the future with mexican
</em><br>
<em>&gt;temporary workers.
</em><br>
<p>As long as they pull permits Mike. 
<br>
<p>Actually much of my value comes not only from training, but from
<br>
long and unusual experience. My first routers had double digit
<br>
serial numbers. I don't sit still and keep up with pretty much
<br>
everything going on in the industry, plus the number of Union
<br>
people really interested in economics or the business end is small.
<br>
<p>I like to think talent has something to do with it. ;)
<br>
<p>I've been here at the data center 12 years now and everyone is
<br>
aware that I'm pretty much the only one who knows how it all works.
<br>
The idea that you can replace one person with another person (an
<br>
industrial age paradigm) doesn't hold true in the information age.
<br>
I always was a big fan of James Doohan.
<br>
<p>Plus I don't plan on being here forever, time to move up...
