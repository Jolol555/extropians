<p><em>&gt;In the news yesterday, it was announced that the State of New Hampshire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has the lowest poverty rate in the entire US, of only 4.4%, versus the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;national average of 9.6%, of families. The US average is at its lowest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;level in 22 years, yet NH's rate is less than half that of the national
</em><br>
<em>&gt;average. State by state breakdowns show that states with significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;degrees of socialism in the form of welfare, public health care, high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;taxation, and heavy regulation of business have the highest poverty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rates among families.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Also noted was older data of community level measurments of child
</em><br>
<em>&gt;poverty, which ranges from 3 - 13% from town to town, with the higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rates of child poverty occuring, interestingly enough, in those same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;communities that are called 'property poor' towns, which have low
</em><br>
<em>&gt;property valuations due to decades of poor local government at the hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Democrat politicians, and consequently are not able to sufficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fund their local school systems without significant state subsidies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think this all pretty much confirms the arguments of libertarians and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other free market proponents: socialism creates poverty
</em><br>
<p><p>But poverty is in many  respects relative, and so therefore cannot be
<br>
defined in absolute dollar amounts (which of course is how they did it
<br>
here). 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;That aside, poverty IMO should be defined as lack of the basics for a
<br>
comfortable &quot;western life&quot;. 
<br>
<p>I can assure you that all those welfare moms definitely do have the
<br>
comforts of a western life, trust me....
<br>
<p>So what you are seeing here is a product of circumstances:  states
<br>
offering good welfare deals will attract from other states people who
<br>
want take advantage of that welfare offered.  States which do not do
<br>
so, will not reap the &quot;benefits&quot; of this migration....that should be
<br>
obvious :-)
