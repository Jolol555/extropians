<p>
I'm a few weeks past my deadline for this announcement, but I'm glad to be
<br>
here at last. I have the Longevity Meme website at a point at which I can
<br>
officially launch the first Project and solicit comments, help and
<br>
participation from those who are interested. (Which from my point of view
<br>
should be all of you, but I'm admittedly biased on this issue :)
<br>
<p>---------------------------------------
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.longevitymeme.org">http://www.longevitymeme.org</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;The Longevity Meme is a California-based non-profit organization, founded
<br>
in mid-2001. Our mission is to assist in bringing on an age in which any
<br>
human being can live comfortably, healthily and capably for as long as he or
<br>
she desires. We aim to ensure that the means and potentials of life
<br>
extension become a common topic for discussion throughout the world.
<br>
<p>Aging is an enemy to all of us, but a lack of information, advocacy and
<br>
awareness of life extension is worse yet. Much of the general public thinks
<br>
of aging as inevitable and natural. Until life extension movements become
<br>
more mainstream, progress in defeating aging will continue to be
<br>
frustratingly slow.
<br>
<p>The Longevity Meme is also an idea; a way in which we can all help ourselves
<br>
and others to live healthily and live longer. How much longer? It is up to
<br>
all of us, as individuals and as a society, to see what can be achieved when
<br>
we all work together.&quot;
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.longevitymeme.org/project-1-site.cfm">http://www.longevitymeme.org/project-1-site.cfm</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;Longevity Meme Projects are comprised of activities and group efforts
<br>
intended to promote awareness and serious discussion of life extension in
<br>
the mainstream media and society at large. We believe that fostering a
<br>
greater consideration of life extension and its potentials is a vital part
<br>
of the fight against aging.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Our first Longevity Meme Project is a little less directly focused on
<br>
awareness than future Projects will be. Before we can act as a community
<br>
resource and center for coordination, we must build the core components of
<br>
this website, write the initial content and form the seed community. This
<br>
Project is underway: join in!&quot;
<br>
<p>---------------------------------------
<br>
<p>The current modest aim is to make the life extension community aware of the
<br>
existence of the Longevity Meme and thereby gather a core or seed community
<br>
of interested helpers to move our first project to completion. At the same
<br>
time, we can discuss and then begin the task of evangelizing the Longevity
<br>
Meme and life extension in general to the general public through future
<br>
projects and activism.
<br>
<p>Please visit the Longevity Meme site and our first project pages, where you
<br>
will find a list of suggestions on how any one of you could help the
<br>
Longevity Meme in ways both large and small. It can be as simple as linking
<br>
to us, telling a friend, or offering us suggestions -- and by helping us
<br>
now, you help yourself in the long term.
<br>
<p>I would appreciate any constructive commentary on this e-mail or any aspects
<br>
of the Longevity Meme being posted to the Longevity Meme Forum:
<br>
<a href="http://www.longevitymeme.org/forum/">http://www.longevitymeme.org/forum/</a>. The simple act of joining the forum and
<br>
posting an opinion helps the Longevity Meme immensely in this early stage of
<br>
building a community. I hope to see some of you over there.
<br>
<p>Lastly, thanks go to Natasha and everyone else involved in Pro-Act for
<br>
(indirectly) provoking me into getting back on track with the Longevity
<br>
Meme.
