Let me say first, that I admire the way your mind works Reason, and regret 
<br>
having to disagree with you.

<em>&gt; &gt; Again, I mention that this might work if we were motivated by economics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; alone, but it isn't so. People develop allegiances and cartels and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anticompetitive practices like price fixing. They use marketing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tactics to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; push shoddy merchandise. They propagate false information using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; advertising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and misleading labels. Companies don't work very well to regulate each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other... that is why we have government-funded investigations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into illegal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; operating practices of some companies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Your implicit assumption here is that customers are powerless and clueless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why are they powerless and clueless?
</em><br>
<p>Not powerless and clueless... we are very easily duped due to our peculiar 
<br>
psychology, but there is plenty of evidence to show that we can move beyond 
<br>
that -- we just have to work at it. Most individuals have traditionally 
<br>
been fairly powerless against large powerful groups. (It doesn't matter 
<br>
whether those large groups are governments, corporations, religious groups, 
<br>
or fashions.)
<br>
<p>Happily, the smarter we become and the more effective our communication 
<br>
then the more powerful the individual becomes. This augurs very well for 
<br>
the future.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Because they have been taught to be so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from birth by a government that reinforces the message &quot;you are powerless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and clueless&quot; with every new piece of legislation that assumes people can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make educated decisions.
</em><br>
<p>Ummmmm... you are right and wrong here. Yes there is some effect there, but 
<br>
I think the larger part is attributable to a tendency by most people to 
<br>
acquiesce to the group and its leaders. Remember that the group can be 
<br>
government, or corporations, or religious groups, or fashion, or tribe, 
<br>
etc. There is nothing magically malevolent about the government. It is in 
<br>
fact another group. Its difference is that it is *supposed* to have a 
<br>
direct responsibility to the people it represents in a democratic 
<br>
society... sometimes it really does, sometimes it doesn't.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;In a completely free market in which the government performs no oversight,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the role of oversight and monitoring becomes open to for-profit concerns,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who will spring up and compete for the dollars that acting in that role can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bring. Because a corrupt oversight organization is one that will shortly go
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out of business [unless of course, it happens to be the government :) ], you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have your free market model for self-regulation right there.
</em><br>
<p>OK. We come to the core of our difference here. You have a faith that pure 
<br>
free market will somehow deliver the most efficient result, and that the 
<br>
government is singularly ineffective at delivering that.
<br>
<p>Remember, when reading this, that I am actually in favor of using the 
<br>
market. I just don't believe it is *The Answer* alone. Here is a list of 
<br>
some market failures to show what I mean:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The qwerty keyboard was designed by Mr Underwood to slow typists so 
<br>
that they wouldn't jam the keys of old mechanical typewriters. Now, with 
<br>
electronic keyboards the qwerty keyboard is a terrible obstacle. The Dvorak 
<br>
keyboard is very easy to learn and makes it possible to type much faster. 
<br>
Why hasn't the market taken up the more efficient system? Because it would 
<br>
be crazy for a secretary to develop their dvorak keyboard skills when they 
<br>
could be working for another boss soon who demands qwerty skills. That is 
<br>
not the only cause... but the others are related.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Amiga computer and IBM home computer were developed at around the 
<br>
same time. The Amiga is a very elegant machine, far ahead of its day. The 
<br>
IBM was developed with old technology and a stunted operating system. Those 
<br>
machines grew to dominate the computer scene not because of their 
<br>
efficiency but because the early adopters of the IBM were the businessmen 
<br>
and accountants who believed that something from IBM *must* be good. I can 
<br>
still hear them speaking sneeringly of the Amiga being like a toy because 
<br>
it had high speed, high resolution, full color graphics and stereo, 4 
<br>
channel sound with computer speech when the IBM had only 16 color text and 
<br>
simple beeps and not even a mouse.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The internet was almost stunted by market forces in its early stages (see
<br>
<a href="http://www.news.com/Perspectives/Soapbox/nn1_3_97a.html">http://www.news.com/Perspectives/Soapbox/nn1_3_97a.html</a> ).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- how wonderful it would be for the whole world to use universal, easy to 
<br>
use metric measurements instead of miles/feet/gallons/ounces. In Australia 
<br>
the government forced that change while businesses whinged about the 
<br>
short-term pain. In USA, where business interests are more powerful, that 
<br>
change was never made.
<br>
<p><p>There are many other examples I could give, but you get my point.
<br>
<p>The market, while powerful and often a force for good, is not always so. 
<br>
There are innumerable examples of corrupt businesses and corrupt business 
<br>
practices. And the market can't be relied upon to eliminate them either, in 
<br>
fact it can actually entrench them... no matter how inefficient they are. 
<br>
Money is only one of the motivators for people. Corruption entrenched in 
<br>
business can be even more difficult to remove than in other groups. It is 
<br>
worsened by the fact that corruption can enable one to accrue terrific 
<br>
economic power.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;One would also assume that a completely free market would &quot;evolve&quot; more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aware, responsible and proactive consumers -- a very good thing in my mind.
</em><br>
<p>You mean one would *hope* that. :-)
<br>
People are becoming more aware and responsible. I see little connection 
<br>
with the free market though. It has some involvement, but doesn't seem to 
<br>
be central... so far.
<br>
<p>As we become smarter and communication improves we become more powerful 
<br>
individuals. One nice result of that is we need groups of all kinds less 
<br>
and less (governments, corporations, national groups, racial groups, 
<br>
intellectual groups). It is the kind of future I hope for one day... but I 
<br>
think it will be quite a long time in coming... decades, maybe even 
<br>
centuries, after the singularity. Until then we need to tread a practical path.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Miriam

Q. What is the similarity between an elephant and a grape?
<br>
A. They are both purple... except for the elephant.
