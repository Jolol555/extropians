<p>I do not think of philosophy as being bound up in geopolitical

<p>I don't know but I suspect a lot of both are needed.  Technology
<br>
by itself cannot establish what it is that is of value, cannot
<br>
create the hierarchy of values.  Thus technology cannot direct
<br>
itself.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The degree of optimism on this list concerning the future is

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And beyond death. &lt;g&gt;  Seriously, I agree in that the &quot;soft
<br>
side&quot; of what we value, of what type of world we wish to create
<br>
and of how we will answers one another's concerns, fears, hopes,
<br>
dreams is outside of the science and technology per se.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The egg heads (no offense intended) have been saying that technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will solve this and that and remove this and that for centuries now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Technology has indeed developed the cures for many diseases and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased crop harvests etc. but most people don't get the benefit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, the eggheads have actually been saying that only a few
<br>
short centuries and in those few short centuries they have been
<br>
largely correct.  Most people have gotten very direct benefits
<br>
from this but human attention is too short to realize just how
<br>
much we have gained in those two centuries.  All of us in
<br>
developed countries and many in the developing countries have
<br>
benefitted.  But we have not necessarily gained in our
<br>
happiness, peace, integration into or enjoyment of life.  Some
<br>
of what has occurred has actually been somewhat detrimental
<br>
there.  I don't think it has to be though.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Will what most people get out of a time and technology that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce diamond houses cheaply be a diamond bullet in the head? If not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Because we will change ourselves also.  Else we will not survive
<br>
long.  A higher speed, more enabled future has less room for
<br>
surviving some of the darker aspects of our condition.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Will Transhumanism become a sort of super technocratic society in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which technologists develop technology only for themselves or can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others join? Will it be the third word that matches: aristocracy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racism.......... transhumanism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Almost every technologist I have ever known has the dream of
<br>
changing the world for the good for everyone, not just
<br>
themselves.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; After all this biotech superman thing is basically a child of National
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Socialism. Sure, now one can in theory claim that with gene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulation even defectives CAN be healed. WILL they be healed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If we wish it and put our wishes into reality.  That is the long
<br>
and short of it.  It is up to us.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Are the words can and should synonyms?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No, not exactly.  But the *can* allows making the *should* a
<br>
reality instead of a platitude.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Over the time (years) that I have been a member of this list I have,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from time to time, noticed what I (perhaps wrongly) interpret to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disdain for poor/uneducated/less intelligent people in many postings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so I wonder  Will everybody get a better body or will there be a races
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of super humans and slave race that serve them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Transhumans do not require slaves.  The question is will
<br>
transhumans take care of and care for those who are not ready or
<br>
willing to be transhuman.  That, again, depends on us, on each
<br>
of us.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; What is to stop Transhumanism from becoming the scientific arm of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future dictatorships?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Nothing but ourselves and our &quot;soft&quot; development, vision and
<br>
committment.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Can Libertarianism be summed up like this: all the freedom, justice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health and life that money can buy. If so how does that change things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the way they are now?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The above has nothing at all to do with libertarianism.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Is or will Transhumanism be nothing more than intellectual confusion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral imbecility, and willful ugliness elaborated into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-conscious ideology: the worship of wealth, power, novelty and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machinery? Will it become the ultimate expression of what many call a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture less and materialist America: a sort of burger and coke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>To some it may seem that way some of the time.  But it does not
<br>
in the least have to be so.  It could instead be the fulfillment
<br>
of all the hopes and dreams of humankind from the beginning.  
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Must Transhumanism demand spiritual pathology. Obviously not since Mr.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Broderick seems to allow for something else, as it were, but how many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumans can make allowances for that which they cannot see?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There are not any transhumans yet but many who aspire to be so. 
<br>
To so aspire is to aspire for the unseen, to aspire to make a
<br>
vision of what can be real.  Sometimes some of us mistakenly
<br>
think the making real means throwing away almost everything we
<br>
cannot measure and treat with technology directly.  An
<br>
understandable but imho self-defeating development.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; For me the ends justify the means but it seems that in Transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the means is the end. Is this a fair judgment?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The end does not justify the means nor are the means the end. 
<br>
The end is the vision and the vision does not allow means that
<br>
are incompatible with it if it is to be made real.  You cannot
<br>
make a vision real by its denial.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; There are those who say that Libertarians and individualists are most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to be solely concerned with their own egotistical and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Narcissistic gratification. Since there are a few here on the list I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask would you refute this claim and how/why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Personally I would find that quite boring.  Creating greater joy
<br>
throughout the entire sentient Being of which we are a part is
<br>
much more fulfilling and has a lot more &quot;kick&quot;.  All of us at
<br>
some time past, present and/or future go through a more
<br>
self-centered period or set of periods.  But it is not the end
<br>
or a final judgment of what we are or any such thing. People
<br>
naturally come out of it when they see a larger and more
<br>
fulfilling way to be.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; How would a Transhumanist egalitarian/collectivist effort express
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself? Would they go for a Borg type society as in Star Trekk?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The Federation is not Borg like and is a better model in that it
<br>
includes individuality but the society is geared to see its
<br>
greatest wealth and greatest good in the maximization of the
<br>
potential of all its members as much as possible.  This is not a
<br>
bad candidate for part of the vision even though its form is
<br>
hopelessly inconsistent in most details with what is expected in
<br>
the next few generations much less the next few centuries.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Why not find ways of extending the use of our already existing brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of making new ones? If the mind can work outside of the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body why go for any form of containment at all? Is it possible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist without limits?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, it isn't an either or.  Extending existing brains is also
<br>
necessary and we may not be able to make new ones fully without
<br>
doing so. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Since our instincts and emotions are our driving forces if we insulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves from them or get rid of them what will our motivating force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I do not agree that instincts and emotions are our driving
<br>
forces as a categoric statement.  We obviously have within us a
<br>
drive to transcend any such supposed limits.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In attempting to become more than human will we become less?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Rhetorical.  To attempt to become more is the very essence of
<br>
much of the best of humanness. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Don't get me wrong. I'm not against science and technology. I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; install a bionic leg today if I could -_-  It's just that I have lived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of my life in what you would call primitive circumstances and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have taken a long time to learn about all the different stuff you guys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk about here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In reading up I have found questions which have bothered me but I did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not want to trouble you all with my lack of knowledge/understanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However since some people on this list seriously wanted to discuss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether or not white people are nicer than black people I figured that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my questions won't be the most stupid ever brought up on the list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, as the progress of technology fuels its own acceleration and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rushes us into the future at exponential speed will we vanish up our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own anuses?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for these questions.  They are really good to ask and to
<br>
attempt to answer.
