&lt;How many extropians now are weighing the idea of living in or near a
<br>
major city- unnecessary risk? I was leaning that way recently, and
<br>
now even more.

<br>
<p>I was already of a mixed mind on this city business. Frankly the 
<br>
&quot;small&quot; cities of the South (Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Louisville,
<br>
Birmingham) are plenty large enough for about anything a body could 
<br>
want.  Burning the Pentagon suggests that taking a job in the Beltway
<br>
was a seriously stupid idea on my part. Rest assured I will be back
<br>
in the country to stay ASAP.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On a side note I'd point out that much of the threat of &quot;superterrorism&quot;
<br>
is rather moot if you just spread out and dig in. Hard to crash
<br>
planes into a whole mountain range at once.  
<br>
&nbsp;Brian's prediction : We just saw the opening shot in the End of
<br>
the Cities (for a half-century or so..till tech changes).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You think we saw &quot;white flight&quot; before...::shakes head::
<br>
&nbsp;I doubt anyone has any more doubts that a nuke attack
<br>
is a probable event sometime in the next decade.  Biologicals
<br>
a certainty. All this time I thought I was being far too paranoid.
