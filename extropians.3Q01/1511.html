Warning: the following is a rambling collection of thoughts rather than a
<br>
coherent essay.
<br>
<p>Daniel Ust wrote:
<br>
<p>&lt;In the US, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Savings &amp; Loans were
<br>
&quot;deregulated.&quot; Specifically, restrictions were loosened on what they could
<br>
invest in. However, the FSLIC -- deposit insurance for the Savings &amp;
<br>
Loans -- was NOT disbanded. ... it's deposit insurance that is to
<br>
blame and the particular deregulatory path taken with regards to the Savings
<br>
and Loans enhanced the problems with deposit insurance.&gt;
<br>
<p>The S&amp;L crisis is a good illustration of the relationship between public
<br>
services and government regulation of human behavior. Federal insurance
<br>
doesn't work without federal regulation. The same relationship between
<br>
service and regulation exists within certain corporate structures (thus, I'm
<br>
writing of human behavior in general rather than with respect to any
<br>
specific economic system). Public and HMO-financed healthcare are further
<br>
examples. Because costs and benefits aren't directly related for any
<br>
individual service provider or consumer, the government or HMO must regulate
<br>
both the allocation of benefits and the manner in which services are
<br>
provided. Doctors and patients complain that accountants and bureaucrats are
<br>
practicing medicine; but without regulation, the systems would probably not
<br>
function at all.
<br>
<p>While it's easy to grasp the relationship between benefits, costs, and human
<br>
behavior at a personal level, most people seem to find it difficult to
<br>
project this relationship to large groups. As Daniel wrote, &lt;Most
<br>
commentators&gt; (I'd broaden that to include most people in general) &lt;believed
<br>
that the Savings and Loan Crisis was caused by
<br>
deregulation and from that derived the notion that deregulation does not
<br>
work.&gt; And yet, given the alternative courses of action open to each
<br>
individual decision maker within the s &amp; l industry in the late 1970's and
<br>
early 1980's, it would be difficult to imagine any outcome other than
<br>
irresponsible behavior.
<br>
<p>To the extent an economic system separates costs and benefits, the behavior
<br>
of each individual must be controlled by something other than the free
<br>
choice of the individual. Within relatively small groups, or larger groups
<br>
whose members have been suitably indoctrinated, individual behavior can be
<br>
governed by such things as love, shame, and social pressure. Within larger,
<br>
more culturally diverse groups, more violent means of regulation are usually
<br>
required. (Perhaps it's wrong to say that someone who decides to take a
<br>
certain action because of social pressure is not choosing freely. Maybe any
<br>
decision should be considered freely chosen unless it's influenced by
<br>
physical force or the threat of physical force.)
<br>
<p>The control of human behavior comes at a high cost both in terms of
<br>
maintaining adequate force (eg. with respect to tax collection, the salaries
<br>
of tax auditors, collections officers, special agents, judges, prison
<br>
wardens) and of lowered productivity of the &quot;controlees,&quot; who will spend a
<br>
portion of their time attempting to evade the controls. Any system that can
<br>
function without the necessity of devoting resources to controlling human
<br>
behavior has an immediate advantage over systems that require such control.
<br>
<p>While control via physical force does not seem to be very practical, control
<br>
through indoctrination would seem to be fairly efficient in some respects.
<br>
(Which brings to mind something I read a while ago--in a comparative study
<br>
of native American cultures, the authors found that the cultures with narrow
<br>
ranges of appropriate behavior allowed their members more personal freedom
<br>
of speech, contract, and so forth than cultures allowing a wide range of
<br>
personal expression)
<br>
The enforcement costs of control are lowered through the use of early
<br>
childhood indoctrination; however, there would seem to be a cost to the
<br>
society in terms of lowered creativity and less flexibility. Cultures
<br>
allowing greater behavioral diversity would be better equipped to cope with
<br>
rapid environmental change.
<br>
<p>I don't think there's any doubt that the present century is and will
<br>
continue to be one of rapid environmental change (I use the term
<br>
environmental change here to include technological change). Cultural
<br>
diversity would seem to be quite desirable; but the freedom of the
<br>
individual to act according to his or her own decisions--thus allowing the
<br>
economy to function more efficiently--also seems desirable. This combination
<br>
of cultural diversity and individual freedom seems to have been possible in
<br>
the past only when people have lived in small, self-governing groups. I
<br>
haven't thought the following through carefully, but I've observed that some
<br>
Internet communities and e-commerce joint ventures have characteristics of
<br>
small, self governing groups. For example, most members know each other and
<br>
continuing business relationships are built on mutual trust rather than law
<br>
(in many cases, the members reside in different countries and their dealings
<br>
are outside the jurisdiction of any legal system). Although some
<br>
geographically based governments have banned the Internet (and some
<br>
corporations limit the flow of information within and from the corporation),
<br>
these governments and corporations will find themselves at a such a great
<br>
disadvantage they'll either fold or liberalize their rules. Possibly the
<br>
Internet will facilitate the creation of societies whose members enjoy both
<br>
cultural diversity and individual freedom.

<p>&lt; Saying that capitalism is not an universal solution
<br>
to every problem is a truism; it is more interesting to look at questions
<br>
about what alternatives exist and when they might be applicable, and
<br>
whether one can propose systems of allocation that are better.&gt;
<br>
<p>Centralized control of a large, geographically diverse population always
<br>
seems to result in disproportional control of resources by small, elite
<br>
groups at the expense of the other members of the population. This seems to
<br>
happen regardless of the type of economic system. Centralized control has
<br>
seemed to be necessary in order to finance and control large-scale projects.
<br>
I've been wondering lately if it would be possible to form joint business
<br>
ventures without hierarchical management systems to engage in large-scale
<br>
projects. If so, there seems to be no need for centralized government, and
<br>
people could actually live in small, self-governing groups. Someone will
<br>
probably say that this wouldn't work because the strong would inevitably
<br>
conquer the weak--thus weak villages would be taken over by their stronger
<br>
neighbors. But I'm not sure this is true. As N. Machiavelli wrote in *The
<br>
Prince*, it's difficult to take over and rule a group of autonomous
<br>
individuals--you constantly have to reconquer them. A world of small
<br>
self-governing villages would probably lack certain things, such as the
<br>
Egyptian and Mexican pyramids, the terraced mountainsides of the Incas and
<br>
other monuments to slave labor. But perhaps these things aren't really worth
<br>
the cost in human suffering.
